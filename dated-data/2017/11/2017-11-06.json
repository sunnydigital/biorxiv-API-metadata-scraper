    "abstract": "FGIN-1-27 is an agonist at the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a cholesterol transporter that is associated with neurosteroidogenesis. This protein has been identified as a peripheral binding site for benzodiazepines; in anamniotes, however, a second TSPO isoform that is absent in amniotes has been implicated in erythropoiesis. Functional conservation of the central benzodiazepine-binding site located in the GABAA receptors has been demonstrated in anamniotes and amniotes alike; however, it was not previously demonstrated for TSPO. The present investigation explored the behavioral effects of FGIN-1-27 on an anxiety test in zebrafish (Danio rerio, Family: Cyprinide) and on a mixed anxiety/panic test on wall lizards (Tropidurus oreadicus, Family: Tropiduridae). Results showed that FGIN-1-27 reduced anxiety-like behavior in the zebrafish light/dark preference test similar to diazepam, but with fewer sedative effects. Similarly, FGIN-1-27 also reduced anxiety- and fear-like behaviors in the defense test battery in wall lizards, again producing fewer sedative-like effects than diazepam; the benzodiazepine was also unable to reduce fear-like behaviors in this species. These results A) underline the functional conservation of TSPO in defensive behavior in anamniotes; B) strengthen the proposal of using anamniote behavior as models in behavioral pharmacology; and C) suggest TSPO/neurosteroidogenesis as a target in treating anxiety disorders.",

    "abstract": "Salamanders (Urodela) have among the largest vertebrate genomes, ranging in size from 10 to 120 pg. Although changes in genome size often occur randomly and in the absence of selection pressure, non-random patterns of genome size variation are evident among specific vertebrate lineages. Several reports suggest a relationship between species richness and genome size, but the exact nature of that relationship remains unclear both within and across different taxonomic groups. Here we report i) a negative relationship between haploid genome size (C-value) and species richness at the family taxonomic level in salamander clades; ii) a correlation of C-value and species richness with clade crown-age but not with diversification rates; iii) strong associations between C-value and either geographical area or climatic niche rate. Finally, we report a relationship between C-value diversity and species diversity at both the family and genus level clades in urodeles.",

    "abstract": "Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is caused by homozygous mutations in human SMN1. Expression of a duplicate gene (SMN2) primarily results in skipping of exon 7 and production of an unstable protein isoform, SMN{Delta}7. Although SMN2 exon skipping is the principal contributor to SMA severity, mechanisms governing stability of SMN isoforms are poorly understood. We used a Drosophila model system and label-free proteomics to identify the SCFSlmb ubiquitin E3 ligase complex as a novel SMN binding partner. SCFSlmb interacts with a phospho-degron embedded within the human and fruitfly SMN YG-box oligomerization domains. Substitution of a conserved serine (S270A) interferes with SCFSlmb binding and stabilizes SMN{Delta}7. SMA-causing missense mutations that block multimerization of full-length SMN are also stabilized in the degron mutant background. Overexpression of SMN{Delta}7S270A, but not wild-type SMN{Delta}7, provides a protective effect in SMA model mice and human motor neuron cell culture systems. Our findings support a model wherein the degron is exposed when SMN is monomeric, and sequestered when SMN forms higher-order multimers.",

    "abstract": "How do people recognize and learn about complex functional structure? Taking inspiration from other areas of cognitive science, we propose that this is achieved by harnessing compositionality: complex structure is decomposed into simpler building blocks. We formalize this idea within the framework of Bayesian regression using a grammar over Gaussian process kernels, and compare this approach with other structure learning approaches. Participants consistently chose compositional (over non-compositional) extrapolations and interpolations of functions. Experiments designed to elicit priors over functional patterns revealed an inductive bias for compositional structure. Compositional functions were perceived as subjectively more predictable than non-compositional functions, and exhibited other signatures of predictability, such as enhanced memorability and reduced numerosity. Taken together, these results support the view that the human intuitive theory of functions is inherently compositional.",

    "abstract": "Most studies that have investigated the brain mechanisms underlying learning have focused on the ability to learn simple stimulus-response associations. However, in everyday life, outcomes are often obtained through complex behavioral patterns involving a series of actions. In such scenarios, parallel learning systems are important to reduce the complexity of the learning problem, as proposed in the framework of hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). One of the key features of HRL is the computation of pseudo-reward prediction errors (PRPEs) which allow the reinforcement of actions that led to a sub-goal before the final goal itself is achieved. Here we wanted to test the hypothesis that, despite not carrying any rewarding value per se, pseudo-rewards might generate a bias in choice behavior when reward contingencies are not well-known or uncertain. Second, we also hypothesized that this bias might be related to the strength of PRPE striatal representations. In order to test these ideas, we developed a novel decision-making paradigm to assess reward prediction errors (RPEs) and PRPEs in two studies (fMRI study: n = 20; behavioural study: n = 19). Our results show that overall participants developed a preference for the most pseudo-rewarding option throughout the task, even though it did not lead to more monetary rewards. fMRI analyses revealed that this preference was predicted by individual differences in the relative striatal sensitivity to PRPEs vs RPEs. Together, our results indicate that pseudo-rewards generate learning signals in the striatum and subsequently bias choice behavior despite their lack of association with actual reward.",

IMP expression levels are currently unpredictable, which renders the pursuit of IMPs for structural and biophysical characterization challenging and inefficient. Experimental evidence demonstrates that changes within the nucleotide or amino-acid sequence for a given IMP can dramatically affect expression; yet these observations have not resulted in generalizable approaches to improved expression. Here, we develop a data-driven statistical predictor named IMProve, that, using only sequence information, increases the likelihood of selecting an IMP that expresses in E. coli. The IMProve model, trained on experimental data, combines a set of sequence-derived features resulting in an IMProve score, where higher values have a higher probability of success. The model is rigorously validated against a variety of independent datasets that contain a wide range of experimental outcomes from various IMP expression trials. The results demonstrate that use of the model can more than double the number of successfully expressed targets at any experimental scale. IMProve can immediately be used to identify favorable targets for characterization.",

    "abstract": "During asymmetric cell division, dynein generates forces, which position the spindle to reflect polarity and ensure correct daughter cell fates. The transient cortical localization of dynein raises the question of its targeting. We found that it accumulates at the microtubule plus-ends like in budding yeast, indirectly hitch-hiking on EBP-2EB1 likely via dynactin. Importantly, this mechanism, which modestly accounts for cortical forces, does not transport dynein, which displays the same binding/unbinding dynamics as EBP-2EB1. At the cortex, dynein tracks can be classified as having either directed or diffusive-like motion. Diffusive-like tracks reveal force-generating dyneins. Their densities are higher on the posterior tip of the embryos, where GPR-1/2LGN concentrate, but their durations are symmetric. Since dynein flows to the cortex are non-polarized, we suggest that this posterior enrichment increases dynein binding, thus accounts for the force imbalance reflecting polarity, and supplements the regulation of mitotic progression via the non-polarized detachment rate.",

    "abstract": "Lateral gene transfers between ancient species contain information about the relative timing of species diversification. Specifically, the ancestors of a donor species must have existed before the descendants of the recipient species. Hence, the detection of a transfer event can be translated into a time constraint between nodes of a phylogeny if the donor and recipient can be identified. When a set of transfers is detected by interpreting the phylogenetic discordance between gene trees and a species tree, the set of all deduced time constraints can be used to rank the species tree, i.e. order totally its internal nodes. Unfortunately lateral gene transfer detection is challenging and current methods produce a significant proportion of false positives. As a result, often, no ranking of the species tree is compatible with the full set of time constraints deduced from predicted transfers. Here we propose a method, implemented in a software called MaxTiC (Maximum Time Consistency), which takes as input a species tree and a series of (possibly inconsistent) time constraints between its internal nodes, weighted by confidence scores. MaxTiC outputs a ranked species tree compatible with a subset of constraints with maximum cumulated confidence score. We extensively test the method on simulated datasets, under a wide range of conditions that we compare to measures on biological datasets. In most conditions the obtained ranked tree is very close to the real one, confirming the potential of dating the history of life with transfers by maximizing time consistency.

    "abstract": "Human sociality depends upon the benefits of mutual aid and extensive communication. However, diverse norms and preferences complicate mutual aid, and ambiguity in meaning hinders communication. Here we demonstrate that these two problems can work together to enhance cooperation through the strategic use of deliberately ambiguous signals: covert signaling. Covert signaling is the transmission of information that is accurately received by its intended audience but obscured when perceived by others. Such signals may allow coordination and enhanced cooperation while also avoiding the alienation or hostile reactions of individuals with different preferences. Although the empirical literature has identified potential mechanisms of covert signaling, such as encryption in humor, there is to date no formal theory of its dynamics. We introduce a novel mathematical model to assess when a covert signaling strategy will evolve, as well as how receiver attitudes coevolve with covert signals. Covert signaling plausibly serves an important function in facilitating within-group cooperative assortment by allowing individuals to pair up with similar group members when possible and to get along with dissimilar ones when necessary. This mechanism has broad implications for theories of signaling and cooperation, humor, social identity, political psychology, and the evolution of human cultural complexity.",

    "abstract": "Advances in genome engineering have resulted in the generation of numerous zebrafish mutant lines. A commonly used method to assess gene expression in the mutants is in situ hybridization (ISH). Because the embryos can be distinguished by genotype after ISH, comparing gene expression between wild type and mutant siblings can be done blinded and in parallel. Such experimental design reduces the technical variation between samples and minimises the risk of bias. This approach, however, requires an efficient method of genomic DNA extraction from post-ISH fixed zebrafish samples to ascribe phenotype to genotype. Here we describe a method to obtain PCR-quality DNA from 95-100% of zebrafish embryos, suitable for genotyping after ISH. In addition, we provide an image analysis protocol for quantifying gene expression of ISH-probed embryos, adaptable for the analysis of different expression patterns. Finally, we show that intensity-based image analysis enables accurate representation of the variability of gene expression detected by ISH and that it can complement quantitative methods like qRT-PCR. By combining genotyping after ISH and computer-based image analysis, we have established a high-confidence, unbiased methodology to assign gene expression levels to specific genotypes, and applied it to the analysis of molecular phenotypes of newly generated lmo4a mutants.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTOur optimized protocol to genotype zebrafish mutant embryos after in situ hybridization and digitally quantify the in situ signal will help to standardize existing experimental designs and methods of analysis.",

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) now enable the study of genetic adaptation in polygenic phenotypes. We test for polygenic adaptation among 187 world-wide human populations using polygenic scores constructed from GWAS of 34 complex traits. We identify signals of polygenic adaptation for anthropometric traits including height, infant head circumference (IHC), hip circumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Analysis of ancient DNA samples indicates that a north-south cline of height within Europe and and a west-east cline across Eurasia can be traced to selection for increased height in two late Pleistocene hunter gatherer populations living in western and west-central Eurasia. Our observation that IHC and WHR follow a latitudinal cline in Western Eurasia support the role of natural selection driving Bergmanns Rule in humans, consistent with thermoregulatory adaptation in response to latitudinal temperature variation.\\n\\nAuthors Note on Failure to ReplicateAfter this preprint was posted, the UK Biobank dataset was released, providing a new and open GWAS resource. When attempting to replicate the height selection results from this preprint using GWAS data from the UK Biobank, we discovered that we could not. In subsequent analyses, we determined that both the GIANT consortium height GWAS data, as well as another dataset that was used for replication, were impacted by stratification issues that created or at a minimum substantially inflated the height selection signals reported here. The results of this second investigation, written together with additional coauthors, have now been published (https://elifesciences.org/articles/39725 along with another paper by a separate group of authors, showing similar issues https://elifesciences.org/articles/39702). A preliminary investigation shows that the other non-height based results may suffer from similar issues. We stand by the theory and statistical methods reported in this paper, and the paper can be cited for these results. However, we have shown that the data on which the major empirical results were based are not sound, and so should be treated with caution until replicated.",

    "abstract": "An average mouse in midlife weighs between 25 and 30 g, with about a gram of tissue in the largest adipose depot (gonadal), and the weight of this depot differs between inbred strains. Specifically, C57BL/6ByJ mice have heavier gonadal depots on average than do 129P3/J mice. To understand the genetic contributions to this trait, we mapped several quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for gonadal depot weight in an F2 intercross population. Our goal here was to fine-map one of these QTLs, Adip20 (formerly Adip5), on mouse chromosome 9. To that end, we analyzed the weight of the gonadal adipose depot from newly created congenic strains. Results from the sequential comparison method indicated at least four rather than one QTL; two of the QTLs were less than 0.5 Mb apart, with opposing directions of allelic effect. Different types of evidence (missense and regulatory genetic variation, human adiposity/body mass index orthologues, and differential gene expression) implicated numerous candidate genes from the four QTL regions. These results highlight the value of mouse congenic strains and the value of this sequential method to dissect challenging genetic architecture.",

    "abstract": "Microbial biofilms are tightly packed, heterogeneous structures that serve as arenas for social interactions. Studies on Gram negative models reveal that during evolution in structured environments like biofilms, isogenic populations commonly diversify into phenotypically and genetically distinct variants. These variants can settle in alternative biofilm niches and develop new types of interactions that greatly influence population productivity. Here, we explore the evolutionary diversification of pellicle biofilms of the Gram positive, spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We discover that - similarly to other species - B. subtilis diversifies into distinct colony variants. These variants dramatically differ in biofilm formation abilities and expression of biofilm-related genes. In addition, using a quantitative approach, we reveal striking differences in surface complexity and hydrophobicity of the evolved colony types. Interestingly, one of the morphotypes completely lost the ability of independent biofilm formation and evolved to hitchhike with other morphotypes with improved biofilm forming abilities. Genome comparison suggests that major phenotypic transformations between the morphotypes can be triggered by subtle genetic differences. Our work demonstrates how positive complementarity effects and exploitative interactions intertwine during evolutionary diversification in biofilms.",

    "abstract": "Intra-tumor heterogeneity is one of the key confounding factors in deciphering tumor evolution. Malignant cells will have variations in their gene expression, copy numbers, and mutation even when coming from a single tumor. Single cell sequencing of tumor cells is of paramount importance for unmasking the underlying the tumor heterogeneity. However extracting features from the single cell genomic data coherent with the underlying biology is computationally challenging, given the extremely noisy and sparse nature of the data. Here we are proposing  Dhaka a variational autoencoder based single cell analysis tool to transform genomic data to a latent encoded feature space that is more efficient in differentiating between the hidden tumor subpopulations. This technique is generalized across different types of genomic data such as copy number variation from DNA sequencing and gene expression data from RNA sequencing. We have tested the method on two gene expression datasets having 4K to 6K tumor cells and two copy number variation datasets having 250 to 260 tumor cells. Analysis of the encoded feature space revealed sub-populations of cells bearing distinct genomic signatures and the evolutionary relationship between them, which other existing feature transformation methods like t-SNE and PCA fail to do.",

Combinations of drugs offer the potential to overcome resistance, however the number of possible combinations is vast necessitating data-driven approaches to find optimal treatments tailored to a patients tumor.

Accurate prediction of haploinsufficient genes is essential for prioritizing and interpreting deleterious variants in genetic studies. Current methods based on mutation intolerance in population data suffer from inadequate power for genes with short transcripts. Here we showed haploinsufficiency is strongly associated with epigenomic patterns, and then developed a new computational method (Episcore) to predict haploinsufficiency from epigenomic data from a broad range of tissue and cell types using machine learning methods. Based on data from recent exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders, Episcore achieved better performance in prioritizing loss of function de novo variants than current methods. We further showed that Episcore was less biased with gene size, and was complementary to mutation intolerance metrics for prioritizing loss of function variants. Our approach enables new applications of epigenomic data and facilitates discovery and interpretation of novel risk variants in studies of developmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "The vaginal microbiome plays an influential role in several disease states in reproductive age women, including bacterial vaginosis (BV). While demographic characteristics are associated with differences in vaginal microbiome community structure, little is known about the influence of sexual and hygiene habits. Furthermore, associations between the vaginal microbiome and risk symptoms of bacterial vaginosis have not been fully elucidated. Using Bayesian network (BN) analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence results, demographic and extensive questionnaire data, we describe both novel and previously documented associations between habits of women and their vaginal microbiome. The BN analysis approach shows promise in uncovering complex associations between disparate data types. Our findings based on this approach support published associations between specific microbiome members (e.g., Eggerthella, Gardnerella, Dialister, Sneathia and Ruminococcaceae), the Nugent score (a BV diagnostic) and vaginal pH (a risk symptom of BV). Additionally, we found that several microbiome members were directly connected to other risk symptoms of BV (such as vaginal discharge, odor, itch, irritation, and yeast infection) including L. jensenii, Corynebacteria, and Proteobacteria. No direct connections were found between the Nugent Score and risk symptoms of BV other than pH, indicating that the Nugent Score may not be the most useful criteria for assessment of clinical BV. We also found that demographics (i.e., age, ethnicity, previous pregnancy) were associated with the presence/absence of specific vaginal microbes. The resulting BN revealed several as-yet undocumented associations between birth control usage, menstrual hygiene practices and specific microbiome members. Many of these complex relationships were not identified using common analytical methods, i.e., ordination and PERMANOVA. While these associations require confirmatory follow-up study, our findings strongly suggest that future studies of the vaginal microbiome and vaginal pathologies should include detailed surveys of participants sanitary, sexual and birth control habits, as these can act as confounders in the relationship between the microbiome and disease. Although the BN approach is powerful in revealing complex associations within multidimensional datasets, the need in some cases to discretize the data for use in BN analysis can result in loss of information. Future research is required to alleviate such limitations in constructing BN networks. Large sample sizes are also required in order to allow for the incorporation of a large number of variables (nodes) into the BN, particularly when studying associations between metadata and the microbiome. We believe that this approach is of great value, complementing other methods, to further our understanding of complex associations characteristic of microbiome research.",

Indeed, recent replication attempts have revealed low levels of replicability, pointing to high rates of false-positives in the literature5-10. A contemporary solution to this problem is pre-registration: commitment to aspects of methods and analysis before data acquisition11. This solution is valid only to the extent that the commitment stage is time-locked to precede data collection. To date, time-locking can only be guaranteed by introducing a third party such as peer reviewers at an early stage, making this solution less appealing for many12. Here we adapt a cryptographic method13 to encode information of study protocol within random aspects of the data acquisition process. This way, the structure of variability in the data time-locks the commitment stage with respect to data acquisition. Being independent of any third party, this method fully preserves scientific autonomy and confidentiality.

We here present the first such tool, SNPs to Identify TB ( SNP-IT). Applying SNP-IT to a collection of clinical genomes from a UK reference laboratory, we demonstrate an unexpectedly high number of M. orygis isolates. These are seen at a similar rate to M. bovis which attracts much health protection resource and yet M. orygis cases have not been previously described in the UK. From an international perspective it is possible that M. orygis is an underestimated zoonosis. As whole genome sequencing is increasingly integrated into the clinical setting, accurate subspecies identification with SNP-IT will allow the clinical phenotype, host range and transmission mechanisms of subspecies of the Mtbc to be studied in greater detail.",

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin is mostly composed of long stretches of repeated DNA sequences prone to ectopic recombination during double-strand break (DSB) repair. In Drosophila,  safe homologous recombination (HR) repair of heterochromatic DSBs relies on a striking relocalization of repair sites to the nuclear periphery. Central to understanding heterochromatin repair is the ability to investigate the 4D dynamics (movement in space and time) of repair sites. A specific challenge of these studies is preventing phototoxicity and photobleaching effects while imaging the sample over long periods of time, and with sufficient time points and Z-stacks to track repair foci over time. Here we describe an optimized approach for high-resolution live imaging of heterochromatic DSBs in Drosophila cells, with a specific emphasis on the fluorescent markers and imaging setup used to capture the motion of repair foci over long time periods. We detail approaches that minimize photobleaching and phototoxicity with a DeltaVision widefield deconvolution microscope, and image-processing techniques for signal recovery post-imaging using SoftWorX and Imaris software. We present a method to derive mean square displacement (MSD) curves revealing some of the biophysical properties of the motion. Finally, describe a method in R to identify tracts of directed motions in mixed trajectories. These approaches enable a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of heterochromatin dynamics and genome stability in the three-dimensional context of the nucleus, and have broad applicability in the field of nuclear dynamics.",

In this study, we quantitatively determined how spatio-temporal elasticity patterns in ECM change during the asexual reproduction of freshwater polyp Hydra. We first determined the mesoscopic protein arrangement in Hydra ECM (mesoglea) by grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering with nano-beam (nano-GISAXS). Our data unraveled fibrillar type I collagen in Hydra mesoglea (Hcol-I) takes an anisotropic, more strongly distorted hexagonal lattice compared to those in vertebrates that could be attributed to the lower proline content and lack of lysin-crosslinks in Hcol-1 fibers. Then, we \"mapped\" the spatio-temporal changes in ECM stiffness ex vivo with aid of nano-indentation. We identified three representative elasticity patterns during tissue growth along the oral-aboral body axis of the animals. Our complementary proteome analysis demonstrated that the elasticity patterns of the ECM correlate with a gradient like distribution of proteases. Perturbations of the oral Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling center further indicated that ECM elasticity patterns are governed by Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. The ex vivo biomechanical phenotyping of Hydra mesoglea established in this study will help us gain comprehensive insights into the spatio-temporal coordination of biochemical and biomechanical cues in tissue morphogenesis in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Generation time varies widely across organisms and is an important factor in the life cycle, life history and evolution of organisms. Although the doubling time (DT), has been estimated for many bacteria in the lab, it is nearly impossible to directly measure it in the natural environment. However, an estimate can be obtained by measuring the rate at which bacteria accumulate mutations per year in the wild and the rate at which they mutate per generation in the lab. If we assume the mutation rate per generation is the same in the wild and in the lab, and that all mutations in the wild are neutral, an assumption that we show is not very important, then an estimate of the DT can be obtained by dividing the latter by the former. We estimate the DT for four species of bacteria for which we have both an accumulation and a mutation rate estimate. We also infer the distribution of DTs across all bacteria from the distribution of the accumulation and mutation rates. Both analyses suggest that DTs for bacteria in the wild are substantially greater than those in the lab, that they vary by orders of magnitude between different species of bacteria and that a substantial fraction of bacteria double very slowly in the wild.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free protein expression systems have been widely used for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering applications in recent years. Yet little is known about protein expression in the cell-free systems. Here we take a systems approach to uncover underlying dynamics of cell-free protein expression. We construct a set of T7 promoter variants to express proteins at different transcription rates in a reconstituted and E. coli extract-based cell-free systems. We find that the maximum expression level and the rate of protein synthesis as responses to the transcription rate change are different in the two cell-free systems, suggesting they are driven by different expression dynamics. We confirm this by constructing a simple mathematical model for each cell-free system, which well reproduce the experimental results and also identify different limiting factors for better protein expression in the two cell-free systems. In particular, they revealed there is a negative feedback effect in the mRNA-protein translation by the PURE system and also identified different limiting factors for better protein expression in the two cell-free systems.",

    "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) drive extensive horizontal transfer in the gut microbiome. This transfer could benefit human health by conferring new metabolic capabilities to commensal microbes, or it could threaten human health by spreading antibiotic resistance genes to pathogens. Despite their biological importance and medical relevance, MGEs from the gut microbiome have not been systematically characterized. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of chromosomal MGEs in the gut microbiome using a method called Split Read Insertion Detection (SRID) that enables the identification of the exact mobilizable unit of MGEs. Leveraging the SRID method, we curated a database of 5600 putative MGEs encompassing seven MGE classes called ImmeDB (Intestinal microbiome mobile element database) (https://immedb.mit.edu/). We observed that many MGEs carry genes that confer an adaptive advantage to the gut environment including gene families involved in antibiotic resistance, bile salt detoxification, mucus degradation, capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis, polysaccharide utilization, and sporulation. We find that antibiotic resistance genes are more likely to be spread by conjugation via integrative conjugative elements or integrative mobilizable elements than transduction via prophages. Additionally, we observed that horizontal transfer of MGEs is extensive within phyla but rare across phyla. Taken together, our findings support a phylum level niche-adaptive gene pools in the gut microbiome. ImmeDB will be a valuable resource for future fundamental and translational studies on the gut microbiome and MGE communities.",

    "abstract": "Metabolomics holds the promise as a new technology to diagnose highly heterogeneous diseases. Conventionally, metabolomics data analysis for diagnosis is done using various statistical and machine learning based classification methods. However, it remains unknown if deep neural network, a class of increasingly popular machine learning methods, is suitable to classify metabolomics data. Here we use a cohort of 271 breast cancer tissues, 204 positive estrogen receptor (ER+) and 67 negative estrogen receptor (ER-), to test the accuracies of autoencoder, a deep learning (DL) framework, as well as six widely used machine learning models, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM), and Generalized Boosted Models (GBM). DL framework has the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 in classifying ER+/ER-patients, compared to the other six machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the biological interpretation of the first hidden layer reveals eight commonly enriched significant metabolomics pathways (adjusted P-value<0.05) that cannot be discovered by other machine learning methods. Among them, protein digestion & absorption and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters pathways are also confirmed in integrated analysis between metabolomics and gene expression data in these samples. In summary, deep learning method shows advantages for metabolomics based breast cancer ER status classification, with both the highest prediction accurcy (AUC=0.93) and better revelation of disease biology. We encourage the adoption of autoencoder based deep learning method in the metabolomics research community for classification.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid progress of protein residue contact prediction, predicted residue contact maps frequently contain many errors. However, information of residue pairing in {beta} strands could be extracted from a noisy contact map, due to the presence of characteristic contact patterns in {beta}-{beta} interactions. This information may benefit the tertiary structure prediction of mainly {beta} proteins. In this work, we introduce a novel ridge-detection-based {beta}-{beta} contact predictor, RDb2C, to identify residue pairing in {beta} strands from any predicted residue contact map. The algorithm adopts ridge detection, a well-developed technique in computer image processing, to capture consecutive residue contacts, and then utilizes a novel multi-stage random forest framework to integrate the ridge information and additional features for prediction. Starting from the predicted contact map of CCMpred, RDb2C remarkably outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on two conventional test sets of {beta} proteins (BetaSheet916 and BetaSheet1452), and achieves F1-scores of ~62% and ~76% at the residue level and strand level, respectively. Taking the prediction of the more advanced RaptorX-Contact as input, RDb2C achieves impressively higher performance, with F1-scores reaching ~76% and ~86% at the residue level and strand level, respectively. According to our tests on 61 mainly {beta} proteins, improvement in the {beta}-{beta} contact prediction can further ameliorate the structural prediction.\\n\\nAvailability: All source data and codes are available at http://166.111.152.91/Downloads.html or at the GitHub address of https://github.com/wzmao/RDb2C.\\n\\nAuthor summaryDue to the topological complexity, mainly {beta} proteins are challenging targets in protein structure prediction.

Quantitative mRNA analyses typically sacrifice the anatomy, relying on embryo microdissection, dissociation, cell sorting, and/or homogenization. Here, we eliminate the tradeoff between quantitation and anatomical context, using multiplexed in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) to perform accurate and precise relative quantitation of mRNA expression with subcellular resolution within whole-mount vertebrate embryos. Gene expression can be queried in two directions: read-out from anatomical space to expression space reveals co-expression relationships in selected regions of the specimen; conversely, read-in from multidimensional expression space to anatomical space reveals those anatomical locations in which selected gene co-expression relationships occur. As we demonstrate by examining gene circuits underlying somitogenesis, quantitative read-out and read-in analyses provide the strengths of flow cytometry expression analyses, but by preserving subcellular anatomical context, they enable iterative bi-directional queries that open a new era for in situ hybridization.\\n\\nSUMMARYMultiplexed in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR) enables quantitative multidimensional analyses of developmental gene expression with subcellular resolution in an anatomical context.",

    "abstract": "Pair bonding is generally linked to monogamous mating systems, where the reproductive benefits of extended mate guarding and/or of bi-parental care are considered key adaptive functions. However, in some species, including coral reef butterflyfishes (f. Chaetodonitidae), pair bonding occurs in sexually immature and homosexual partners, and in the absence of parental care, suggesting there must be non-reproductive adaptive benefits of pair bonding. Here, we examined whether pair bonding butterflyfishes cooperate in defense of food, conferring direct benefits to one or both partners. Pairs of Chaetodon lunulatus and C. baronessa use contrasting cooperative strategies. In C. lunulatus, both partners mutually defend their territory, while in C. baronessa, males prioritize territory defence; conferring improvements in feeding and energy reserves in both sexes relative to solitary counterparts. We further demonstrate that partner fidelity contributes to this function by showing that re-pairing invokes intra-pair conflict and inhibits cooperatively-derived feeding benefits, and that partner endurance is required for these costs to abate. Overall, our results suggest that in butterflyfishes, pair bonding enhances cooperative defense of prey resources, ultimately benefiting both partners by improving food resource acquisition and energy reserves.",

    "abstract": "Insects use species-specific sex pheromone blends to attract members of the opposite sex which express the corresponding molecular receptors. Given this lock and key mechanism used for species identification and mate choice, it is currently not well understood how pheromone blends or receptor systems evolve. One possibility is that insects develop preferences for new sex pheromone blends via the process of learning, and that these learned preferences may be passed on to the next generation. We tested these hypotheses by exposing newly emerged Bicyclus anynana female butterflies to either wild type or to modified male sex pheromone blends. A few days later, we scored female mating outcome in a choice trial involving both male types. We also assessed the mating outcome of naive offspring of females that underwent distinct odor learning trials to test for a potential inheritance of learned odor preferences. Naive (parental) females mated preferentially with Wt-blend males, but females pre-exposed to new blends either shifted their preference to new-blend males, or mated equally with males of either blend type; the response depending on the new blend they were introduced to. Naive daughters of females who were exposed to new-blend males behaved similarly to their experienced mothers. We demonstrate that females are able to learn preferences for novel pheromone blends in response to a short social experience, and pass that learned preference down to the next generation. This suggests that learning can be a key factor in the evolution of sex pheromone blend recognition and in chemosensory speciation.\\n\\nSignificance statementWhile the diversity of sex pheromone communication systems across insects is well documented, the mechanisms that lead to such diversity are not well understood. Sex pheromones constitute a species-specific system of sexual communication that reinforces interspecific reproductive isolation. When odor blends evolve, the efficacy of male-female communication becomes compromised, unless preference for novel blends also evolves. We explore odor learning as a possible mechanism leading to changes in sex pheromone preferences. We show that preferences for new blends can develop following a short learning experience, and that these novel preferences can be transmitted to the next generation. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of sex pheromone blend preference learning impacting mate choice and being inherited in an insect.",

    "abstract": "Self-fertilization is often associated with ecological traits corresponding to the ruderal strategy in Grimes Competitive-Stress-tolerant-Ruderal (CSR) classification of ecological strategies. Consequently, selfers are expected to be less competitive than outcrossers, either because of a colonization/competition trade-off or because of the deleterious genetic effects of selfing. Range expansion could reduce further competitive ability while polyploidy could mitigate the effects of selfing. Although suggested by meta-analyses, these predictions have not been directly tested yet. We compared the competitive ability of four Capsella species differing by their mating system and ploidy level. We found that the two diploid selfing species (C. rubella and C. orientalis) were more sensitive to competition than the diploid outcrosser (C. grandiflora), and that the tetraploid selfer (C. bursa-pastoris) was intermediate. Within C. bursa-pastoris, we also found that sensitivity to competition increased in parallel to range expansion.

    "abstract": "As antimicrobial signalling molecules, type III or lambda interferons (IFN{lambda}s) are critical for defence against infection by diverse pathogens. Counter-intuitively, expression of one member of the family, IFN{lambda}4, is associated with decreased clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the human population; by contrast, a natural in-frame nucleotide insertion that abrogates IFN{lambda}4 production improves viral clearance. To further understand how genetic variation between and within species affects IFN{lambda}4 function, we screened a panel of extant coding variants of human IFN{lambda}4 and identified three variants that substantially affect antiviral activity (P70S, L79F and K154E). The most notable variant was K154E, which enhanced in vitro activity in a range of antiviral and interferon stimulated gene (ISG) assays. This more active E154 variant of IFN{lambda}4 was found only in African Congo rainforest  Pygmy hunter-gatherers. Remarkably, E154 was highly conserved as the ancestral residue in mammalian IFN{lambda}4s yet K154 is the dominant variant throughout evolution of the hominid genus Homo. Compared to chimpanzee IFN{lambda}4, the human orthologue had reduced activity due to amino acid substitution of glutamic acid with lysine at position 154. Meta-analysis of published gene expression data from humans and chimpanzees showed that this difference in activity between K154 and E154 in IFN{lambda}4 is consistent with differences in antiviral gene expression in vivo during HCV infection. Mechanistically, our data suggest that human-specific K154 likely affects IFN{lambda}4 activity by reducing secretion and potency. We postulate that evolution of an IFN{lambda}4 with attenuated activity in humans (K154) likely contributes to distinct host-specific responses to and outcomes of infection, such as HCV.",

    "abstract": "Animals display remarkable variation in social behavior. However, outside of rodents, little is known about the neural mechanisms of social variation, and whether they are shared across species and sexes, limiting our understanding of how sociality evolves. Using coral reef butterflyfishes, we examined gene expression correlates of social variation (i.e., pair bonding vs. solitary living) within and between species and sexes. In several brain regions, we quantified gene expression of receptors important for social variation in mammals: oxytocin (OTR), arginine vasopressin (V1aR), dopamine (D1R, D2R), and mu-opioid (MOR). We found that social variation across individuals of the oval butterflyfish, Chaetodon lunulatus, is linked to differences in OTR,V1aR, D1R, D2R, and MOR gene expression within several forebrain regions in a sexually dimorphic manner. However, this contrasted with social variation among six species representing a single evolutionary transition from pair bonded to solitary living. Here, OTR expression within the supracommissural part of the ventral telencephalon was higher in pair bonded than solitary species, specifically in males. These results contribute to the emerging idea that nonapeptide, dopamine, and opioid signaling is a central theme to the evolution of sociality across individuals, although the precise mechanism may be flexible across sexes and species.",

    "abstract": "Visual information is conveyed from the retina to the brain by a diverse set of retinal ganglion cells. Although they have differing nonlinear properties, nearly all ganglion cell receptive fields on average compute a difference in intensity across space and time using a region known as the classical or linear surround1,2, a property that improves information transmission about natural visual scenes3,4. The spatiotemporal visual features that create this fundamental property have not been quantitatively assigned to specific interneurons. Here we describe a generalizable causal approach using simultaneous intracellular and multielectrode recording to directly measure and manipulate the sensory feature conveyed by a neural pathway to a downstream neuron. Analyzing two inhibitory cell classes, horizontal cells and linear amacrine cells, we find that rather than transmitting different temporal features, the two inhibitory pathways act synchronously to create the salamander ganglion cell surround at different spatial scales. Using these measured visual features and theories of efficient coding, we computed a fitness landscape representing the information transmitted using different weightings of the two inhibitory pathways. This theoretical landscape revealed a ridge that maintains near-optimal information transmission while allowing for receptive field diversity. The ganglion cell population showed a striking match to this prediction, concentrating along this ridge across a wide range of positions using different weightings of amacrine or horizontal cell visual features. These results show how parallel neural pathways synthesize a sensory computation, and why this architecture achieves the potentially competing objectives of high information transmission of individual ganglion cells, and diversity among receptive fields.",

    "abstract": "Biological networks are becoming increasingly large and complex, pushing the limits of existing 2D tools. iCAVE is an open source software tool for interactive visual explorations of large and complex networks in 3D, stereoscopic 3D or immersive 3D. It introduces new 3D network layout algorithms and 3D-extensions of popular 2D network layout, clustering and edge bundling algorithms to assists researchers in understanding the underlying patterns in large, multi-layered, clustered or complex networks. This protocol aims to guide new users on the basic functions of iCAVE for loading data, laying out networks (single or multi-layered), bundling edges, clustering networks, visualizing clusters, visualizing data attributes and saving output images or videos. It also provides examples on visualizing networks constrained in physical 3D space (e.g. proteins; neurons; brain). It is accompanied with a new version of iCAVE with an enhanced user interface and highlights new features useful for existing users.\\n\\nSignificance StatementNetwork representations assist in systems-level data exploration in many research fields, providing valuable insights. However, with the recent advances in experimental technologies, biological networks are becoming increasingly large and complex, necessitating new data visualization solutions. We have recently developed iCAVE (Liluashvili et al., 2017), an open?source software platform that enables 3D (optionally stereoscopic and or immersive) visualizations of complex, dense or multi?layered biological networks. Users can select from several new 3D network layout and clustering algorithms, bundle network edges and customize network attributes to reveal hidden structures within them. This protocol guides new users on loading, navigating, customizing and saving networks in iCAVE and is accompanied by an updated version of the software.",

    "abstract": "The systematic assessment of intra-tumor heterogeneity is still limited and often unfeasible. In silico investigations of large tumor cohorts can be used to decipher how multiple clones emerge and organize into complex architectures. Here, we addressed this challenge by integrating mathematical modeling of cancer evolution with algorithmic inference of clonal phylogenies in 2,600 human tumors from 15 tumor types. Through numerical simulations, we could discriminate between observable and hidden intra-tumor heterogeneity, the latter characterized by clones that are missed by DNA sequencing of human samples. To overcome this limitation in human tumors, we show that population frequencies of detectable clones can be used to estimate the extent of hidden heterogeneity. Overall, simulated and human clonal architectures were highly concordant and showed that high numbers of clones invariably emerge through branching lineages. Interestingly, high numbers of alterations were not necessarily associated with high intra-tumor heterogeneity. Indeed, tumors with alterations in proliferation-associated genes exhibited high numbers of clonal mutations, but few clones. Instead, mutations of chromatin remodeling genes characterized tumors with high numbers of subclonal alterations and multiple clones. Our results identify evolutionary and genetic determinants of tumor clonal architectures to guide functional investigations of intra-tumor heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe common colon-26 mouse (C-26) model of experimental cachexia mimics recent late stage clinical failures of anabolic anti-cachexia therapy, and does not respond to the anabolic selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) GTx-024. Based on the demonstrated anti-cachectic efficacy of the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) AR-42 in this model, we hypothesized that combined SARM/AR-42 would provide improved anti-cachectic efficacy.\\n\\nDesignIn the C-26 model, we determined a reduced efficacious dose of AR-42 which was combined with anabolic SARM therapy and evaluated for anti-cachectic efficacy. The effects of treatment and tumor burden on anabolic and catabolic signaling occurring in skeletal muscle were characterized using muscle performance parameters and RNA-seq.\\n\\nResultsAnabolic anti-cachexia therapy with diverse androgens had no impact on cachectic outcomes in the C-26 model. A reduced dose of the HDACi AR-42 alone provided limited anti-cachectic benefits, but when combined with the SARM GTx-024, significantly improved bodyweight (p<0.0001), hind limb muscle mass (p<0.05), and voluntary grip strength (p<0.0001) versus tumor-bearing controls. Reduced-dose AR-42 treatment suppressed the IL-6/GP130/STAT3 signaling axis without significantly impacting circulating cytokine levels. GTx-024-mediated {beta}-catenin target gene regulation was apparent in cachectic mice only when combined with AR-42.\\n\\nConclusionsCachectic signaling in the C-26 model is comprised of catabolic signaling insensitive to anabolic GTx-024 therapy and a blockade of GTx-024-mediated anabolic signaling. AR-42 treatment mitigates catabolic gene activation and restores anabolic responsiveness to GTx-024. Combining GTx-024, a clinically established anabolic therapy, with a low dose of AR-42, a clinically evaluated HDACi, represents a promising approach to improve anabolic response in cachectic patient populations.",

    "abstract": "For many animals, affiliative relationships such as pair bonds form the foundation of society, and are highly adaptive. Animal systems amenable for comparatively studying pair bonding are important for identifying underlying biological mechanisms, but mostly exist in mammals. Better establishing fish systems will enable comparison of pair bonding mechanisms across taxonomically distant lineages that may reveal general underlying principles. We examined the utility of wild butterflyfishes (f: Chaetodontidae; g: Chaetodon) for comparatively studying pair bonding. Stochastic character mapping inferred that within the family, pairing is ancestral, with at least seven independent transitions to group formation and seven transition to solitary behavior from the late Miocene to recent. In six sympatric and wide-spread species representing a clade with one ancestrally reconstructed transition from paired to solitary grouping, we then verified social systems at Lizard Island, Australia. In situ observations confirmed that Chaetodon baronessa, C. lunulatus, and C. vagabundus are predominantly pair bonding, whereas C. rainfordi, C. plebeius, and C. trifascialis are predominantly solitary. Even in the predominantly pair bonding species, C. lunulatus, a proportion of adults (15 %) are solitary. Importantly, inter- and intra-specific differences in social systems do not co-vary with other previously established attributes (geographic occurrence, parental care, diet, or territoriality). Hence, the proposed butterflyfish populations are promising for comparative analyses of pair bonding and its mechanistic underpinnings. Avenues for further developing the system are proposed, including determining whether the utility of these species applies across their geographic disruptions.",

The Northeastern population of mountain lions has been largely nonexistent since the early 1800s and was officially declared extinct in 2011. This regionally extinct mountain lion is Pennsylvania State Universitys official mascot, where it is referred to as the  Nittany Lion. Our goal in this study was to use recent methodological advances in ancient DNA and massively parallel sequencing to reconstruct complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genomes of multiple Nittany Lions by sampling from preserved skins. This effort is part of a broader Nittany Lion Genome project intended to involve undergraduates in ancient DNA and bioinformatics research and to engage the broader Penn State community in discussions about conservation biology and extinction. Complete mtDNA genome sequences were obtained from five individuals. When compared to previously published sequences, Nittany Lions are not more similar to each other than to individuals from the Western U.S. and Florida. Supporting previous findings, North American mountain lions overall were more closely related to each other than to those from South America and had lower genetic diversity. This result emphasizes the importance of continued conservation in the Western U.S. and Florida to prevent further regional extinctions.",

    "abstract": "The timing of DNA replication is largely regulated by the location and timing of replication origin firing. Therefore, much effort has been invested in identifying and analyzing human replication origins. However, the heterogeneous nature of eukaryotic replication kinetics and the low efficiency of individual origins in metazoans has made mapping the location and timing of replication initiation in human cells difficult. We have mapped early-firing origins in HeLa cells using Optical Replication Mapping, a high-throughput single-molecule approach based on Bionano Genomics genomic mapping technology. The single-molecule nature and 290-fold coverage of our dataset allowed us to identify origins that fire with as little as 1% efficiency. We find sites of human replication initiation in early S phase are not confined to well-defined efficient replication origins, but are instead distributed across broad initiation zones consisting of many inefficient origins. These early-firing initiation zones co-localize with initiation zones inferred from Okazaki-fragment-mapping analysis and are enriched in ORC1 binding sites. Although most early-firing origins fire in early-replication regions of the genome, a significant number fire in late-replicating regions, suggesting that the major difference between origins in early and late replicating regions is their probability of firing in early S-phase, as opposed to qualitative differences in their firing-time distributions. This observation is consistent with stochastic models of origin timing regulation, which explain the regulation of replication timing in yeast.",

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is a well-known bioplastic that is produced by several microbes using organic carbon sources. Autotrophic (using carbon dioxide or CO2) PHB production is reported for only a few organisms. Sustainable PHB bioproduction using other autotrophic microbes needs to be explored. Rhodopseudomonas palustris, a metabolically versatile purple non-sulfur bacterium (PNSB) is known to produce PHBs under photoheterotrophic conditions. Rhodopseudomonas palustris strain TIE-1 demonstrates extended metabolic versatility by using electron sources such as ferrous iron and poised electrodes for photoautotrophy. Here we report the ability of TIE-1 to produce PHB under photoferroautotrophic (light - energy source, ferrous iron - electron source and CO2 - carbon source) and photoelectroautotrophic (light - energy source, poised electrodes - electron source and CO2 - carbon source) growth conditions. PHB accumulation was observed both under nitrogen (N2) fixing and non-N2 fixing conditions. For comparison, we determined PHB production under chemoheterotrophic, photoheterotrophic and photoautotrophic conditions using hydrogen as the electron donor. Photoferroautotrophic and photoelectroautotrophic PHB production was on par with that observed from organic carbon substrates such as butyrate. PHB production increased during N2 fixation under photoheterotrophic conditions but not during photoautotrophic growth. Electron microscopy confirmed that TIE-1 cells accumulate PHBs internally under the conditions that showed highest production. However, gene expression analysis suggests that PHB cycle genes are not differentially regulated despite observable changes in biopolymer production.",

In recent years investigators have found that action potential firing rates increase during elevations in power high-frequency band oscillations (50-200 Hz range). However action potentials also contribute to the LFP signal itself, making the spike-LFP relationship complex. Here we examine the relationship between spike rates and LFPs in varying frequency bands in rat neocortical recordings. We find that 50-180Hz oscillations correlate most consistently with high firing rates, but that other LFPs bands also carry information relating to spiking, including in some cases anti-correlations. Relatedly, we find that spiking itself and electromyographic activity contribute to LFP power in these bands. The relationship between spike rates and LFP power varies between brain states and between individual cells. Finally, we create an improved oscillation-based predictor of action potential activity by specifically utilizing information from across the entire recorded frequency spectrum of LFP. The findings illustrate both caveats and improvements to be taken into account in attempts to infer spiking activity from LFP.",

Its investigation is relevant to unravel the neural correlates of colour perception in isolation from low-level neural processing of spectral components, as well as the neural correlates of imagination by being able to reliably trigger imaginary colour experiences. However, functional MRI studies using univariate analyses failed to provide univocal evidence of the activation of the  colour network by synaesthesia. Applying Multivariate (multivoxel) Pattern Analysis (MVPA) on 20 synaesthetes and 20 control participants, we tested whether the neural processing of real colours (concentric rings) and synaesthetic colours (black graphemes) shared patterns of activations. Region of interest analyses in retinotopically and anatomically defined visual regions revealed neither evidence of shared circuits for real and synaesthetic colour processing, nor processing difference between synaesthetes and controls. We also found no correlation with individual experiences, characterised by measuring the strength of synaesthetic associations. The whole brain, searchlight, analysis led to similar results. We conclude that identifying the neural correlates of the synaesthetic experience of colours may still be beyond the reach of present technology and data analysis techniques.",

In the one-cell C. elegans embryo, a contractile cortical actomyosin network contributes to anterior-posterior (A-P) polarity and asymmetric division by segregating PAR proteins to discrete cortical domains. Here, we discovered that the plasma membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) forms dynamic structures in C. elegans zygotes, distributing in a polarized and PAR-dependent manner along the A-P axis. PIP2 cortical structures overlap with F-actin and coincide with the actin regulators RHO-1, CDC-42 and ECT-2. Particle image velocimetry analysis revealed that PIP2 and F-actin cortical movements are coupled, with PIP2 structures moving slightly ahead. Importantly, we established that PIP2 cortical structures form in an actin-dependent manner and, conversely, that decreasing or increasing the level of PIP2 results in severe F-actin disorganization, revealing the interdependence between these components. Furthermore, we uncovered that PIP2 regulates the sizing of PAR cortical domains. Overall, our work establishes for the first time that a lipid membrane component, PIP2, is a critical modulator of actin organization and cell polarity in C. elegans embryos.\\n\\nSummary statementPI(4,5)P2 is distributed in dynamic cortical structures and regulates asymmetric division by controlling actin organization and cell polarity in the one-cell C. elegans embryo.",

    "abstract": "Changes in gene regulation during differentiation are governed by networks of transcription factors. To identify the minimal network for endodermal differentiation in the Arabidopsis root, we asked what transcription factors are sufficient to program a non-native cell-type into endodermis. Our results show the transcription factors SHORTROOT and MYB36 have limited ability to reprogram a non-native cell-type (the epidermis) and that this reprogramming is reversible in the absence of additional cues. The stele-derived signaling peptide CIF2 stabilizes SHORTROOT-induced reprogramming. The outcome is a partially impermeable barrier deposited in the sub-epidermal cell layer that has a transcriptional signature similar to endodermis. The trans-differentiation mechanism depends on the expression of genes downstream in the gene regulatory network but is independent of SHORTROOT movement. These results highlight a non cell-autonomous induction mechanism for endodermis that resembles differentiation in many animal systems.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummarySHORTROOT and CIF2 combined can induce and stabilize an endodermis in sub-epidermal cells and do so in a non cell-autonomous manner.",

    "abstract": "Many experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, including in epilepsy research. However, rats and mice are social animals; and individual housing constitutes a stressful situation. The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of individual housing as compared to conditions maintaining social contact on stress markers and epilepsy. Control male mice socially housed during pretest and then transferred to individual cages for six weeks displayed anhedonia, increased anxiety and biological markers of stress as compared to pretest values or mice kept socially housed during six weeks. Pilocarpine-treated mice housed together showed increased levels of anhedonia, anxiety and stress markers as well as decreased cognitive performance as compared to the control group. The differences were more significant in pilocarpine-treated mice housed individually. Anxiety correlated linearly with cognitive performance and stress markers independently of the experimental conditions. In the male rat pilocarpine model, seizures were sixteen times more frequent in singly housed animals as compared to animals kept in pairs. Daily interactions with an experimenter in otherwise singly housed animals was sufficient to produce results identical to those found in animals kept in pairs. We propose that social isolation produces a severe phenotype in terms of stress and seizure frequency as compared to animals maintaining social contact (at least in these two models), a factor that needs to be taken into account for data interpretation, in particular for preclinical studies.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany experimental approaches require housing rodents in individual cages, a stressful condition for social animals, even in an enriched environment context. Using the pilocarpine model of epilepsy in rats and mice, we report that singly housing animals develop a more severe phenotype in terms of stress and epilepsy as compared to animals maintaining social contact. We propose that social isolation adds a degree of complexity for the interpretation of data, which may be particularly relevant for preclinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free protein expression systems have become widely used in systems and synthetic biology. In this study, we developed an ensemble of dynamic E. coli cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) models. Model parameters were estimated from a training dataset for the cell-free production of a protein product, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The dataset consisted of measurements of glucose, organic acids, energy species, amino acids, and CAT. The ensemble accurately predicted these measurements, especially those of the central carbon metabolism. We then used the trained model to evaluate the optimality of protein production. CAT was produced with an energy efficiency of 12%, suggesting that the process could be further optimized. Reaction group knockouts showed that protein productivity and the metabolism as a whole depend most on oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis and gluco-neogenesis. Amino acid biosynthesis is also important for productivity, while the overflow metabolism and TCA cycle affect the overall system state. In addition, the translation rate is shown to be more important to productivity than the transcription rate. Finally, CAT production was robust to allosteric control, as was most of the network, with the exception of the organic acids in central carbon metabolism. This study is the first to use kinetic modeling to predict dynamic protein production in a cell-free E. coli system, and should provide a foundation for genome scale, dynamic modeling of cell-free E. coli protein synthesis.",

To our knowledge this is the first study documenting such a comprehensive diversity of multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli in wastewater. The genomic diversity of the isolates was unexpectedly high and contained a high number of resistance and virulence genes. To illustrate the genomic diversity of the isolates we calculated the pan genome of the wastewater Escherichia coli and found it to contain over sixteen thousand genes. To analyse this diverse dataset, we devised a computational approach correlating genotypic variation and resistance phenotype, this way we were able to identify not only known, but also candidate resistance genes. Finally, we could verify that the effluent of a wastewater treatment plant will contain multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli belonging to clinically important clonal groups.",

The biological driving force for a genetically-defined limit on the lifespan of a given species (herein called \\\"lifespan setpoint\\\") remains poorly understood. Here we present mathematical models suggesting that an upper limit of individual lifespans protects their cohort population from infection-associated penalties. A shorter lifespan setpoint helps control pathogen spread within a population, prevents the establishment and progression of infections, and accelerates pathogen clearance from the population when compared to populations with long-lived individuals. Strikingly, shorter-living variants efficiently displace longer-living individuals in populations that are exposed to pathogens and exist in spatially structured niches. The beneficial effects of shorter lifespan setpoints are even more evident in the context of zoonotic transmissions, where pathogens undergo adaptation to a new host. We submit that the selective pressure of infectious disease provides an evolutionary driving force to limit individual lifespan setpoints after reproductive maturity to secure its kins fitness. Our findings have important public health implications for efforts to extend humans lifespan.",

Here, we use 8,595 protein coding-region sequences from 9 mammalian species to examine the relationship between deletion rate and dN/dS. We found significant positive correlations at both the level of sites and genes. We compared our data against controls consisting of simulated coding sequences evolving along identical phylogenetic trees, where the correlation is not included in the model a priori. A much weaker correlation was found in the corresponding simulated sequences, which is probably caused by alignment errors. In the real data, the correlations cannot be explained by alignment errors.

    "abstract": "Balancing selection is defined as a class of selective regimes that maintain polymorphism above what is expected under neutrality. Theory predicts that balancing selection reduces population differentiation, as measured by FST. However, balancing selection regimes in which different sets of alleles are maintained in different populations could increase population differentiation. To tackle this issue, we investigated population differentiation at the HLA genes, which constitute the most striking example of balancing selection in humans. We found that population differentiation of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the HLA genes is on average lower than that of SNPs in other genomic regions. However, this result depends on accounting for the differences in allele frequency between selected and putatively neutral sites. Our finding of reduced differentiation at SNPs within HLA genes suggests a predominant role of shared selective pressures among populations at a global scale. However, in pairs of closely related populations, where genome-wide differentiation is low, differentiation at HLA is higher than in other genomic regions. This pattern was reproduced in simulations of overdominant selection. We conclude that population differentiation at the HLA genes is generally lower than genome-wide, but it may be higher for recently diverged population pairs, and that this pattern can be explained by a simple overdominance regime.",

    "abstract": "1.Influenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory pathogen that causes substantial morbidity and mortality during both seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. Infection outcomes in unexposed populations are affected by host genetics, but this host genetic architecture is not well understood. Here we obtain a broad view of how heritable factors affect a mouse model of response to IAV infection using an 8x8 diallel of the eight inbred founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC). Expanding on a prior statistical framework for modeling treatment response in diallels, we explore how a range of heritable effects modify acute host response to IAV through 4 days post-infection. Heritable effects in aggregate explained about 57% of the variance in IAV-induced weight loss. Much of this was attributable to a pattern of additive effects that became more prominent through day 4 post-infection and was consistent with previous reports of anti-influenza myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1) polymorphisms segregating between these strains; the additive effects largely recapitulated haplotype effects observed at the Mx1 locus in a previous study of the incipient CC (pre-CC), and are also replicated here in a CC recombinant intercross (CC-RIX) population. Genetic dominance of protective Mx1 haplotypes was observed to differ by subspecies origin: relative to the domesticus null Mx1 allele, musculus acts dominantly whereas castaneus acts additively. After controlling for Mx1, heritable effects, though less distinct, accounted for about 34% of the phenotypic variance. Implications for future mapping studies are discussed.",

Dysregulation of the PI3K pathway can lead to autoimmune disease and cancer. PIK3IP1 (or Transmembrane Inhibitor of PI3K - TrIP) is a novel transmembrane regulator of PI3K. TrIP contains an extracellular kringle domain and an intracellular \\\"p85-like\\\" domain with homology to the inter-SH2 domain of the regulatory subunit of PI3K. Although TrIP has been shown to bind to the p110 catalytic subunit of PI3K in fibroblasts, the mechanism by which TrIP functions is poorly understood. We show that both the kringle and \\\"p85-like\\\" domains are necessary for TrIP inhibition of PI3K. We also demonstrate that TrIP protein is down-modulated from the surface of T cells to allow T cell activation. In addition, we present evidence that the kringle domain may modulate TrIP function by binding an as-yet-unidentified ligand. Using an inducible knockout mouse model that we developed, we show that TrIP-deficient T cells exhibit more robust T cell activation, show a preference for Th1 polarization and can mediate clearance of Listeria monocytogenes infection faster than WT mice. Thus, TrIP is an important negative regulator of T cell activation and may represent a novel target for immune modulation therapies.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster has played a key role in our understanding of invertebrate immunity. However, both functional and evolutionary studies of host-virus interaction in Drosophila have been limited by a dearth of native virus isolates. In particular, despite a long history of virus research, DNA viruses of D. melanogaster have only recently been described, and none have been available for experimental study. Here we report the isolation and comprehensive characterisation of Kallithea virus, a large double-stranded DNA virus, and the first DNA virus to have been reported from wild populations of D. melanogaster. We find that Kallithea virus infection is costly for adult flies, reaching high titres in both sexes and disproportionately reducing survival in males and movement and late fecundity in females. Using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, we quantify host genetic variance for virus-induced mortality and viral titre and identify candidate host genes that may underlie this variation, including Cdc42-interacting protein 4. Using full transcriptome sequencing of infected males and females, we examine the transcriptional response of flies to Kallithea virus infection, and describe differential regulation of virus-responsive genes. This work establishes Kallithea virus as a new tractable model to study the natural interaction between D. melanogaster and DNA viruses, and we hope it will serve as a basis for future studies of immune responses to DNA viruses in insects.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is a useful model species to study host-virus interaction and innate immunity. However, few natural viruses of Drosophila have been available for experiments, and no natural DNA viruses of Drosophila melanogaster have been available at all. Although infecting flies with viruses from other insects has been useful to uncover general immune mechanisms, viruses that naturally infect wild flies could help us to learn more about the coevolutionary process, and more about the genes that underlie the host-virus interaction. Here we present an isolate of a DNA virus (named Kallithea Virus) that naturally infects the model species Drosophila melanogaster in the wild. We describe the basic biology of infection by this virus, finding that both male and females flies die from infection, but females are more tolerant of infection than males, while laying lay fewer eggs than uninfected females. We quantify genetic variation for virus resistance in the flies, and we use RNA sequencing to see which genes are expressed in male and female flies in response to infection. These results will form the basis for further research to understand how insects defend themselves against infection by DNA viruses, and how DNA viruses can overcome antiviral defence.",

The response of each gene to changes in TF activity is generally assumed to be encoded in the promoter. Here we show that, even when the promoter itself remains constant, each gene has a unique TF dose response curve. Genes have an intrinsic ability to either buffer or amplify the effects of high promoter activity. We present a coupled mathematical model and experimental system for quantifying this property. Promoter activity buffering can be encoded by sequences in both the open reading frame and 3end of genes, and can be implemented by both autoregulatory feedback loops and by titration of limiting trans regulators. We show experimentally that promoter activity buffering insulates cells from fitness defects due to misexpression. The response of genes to changes in [TF] is encoded by sequences outside of the promoter, and this effect can either insulate or amplify the effects of aneuploidy and misregulation on organismal fitness.",

    "abstract": "To provide means for novel crop breeding strategies, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the interaction between plants and their pathogens. Network modelling represents a powerful tool that can unravel properties of complex biological systems. Here, we build on a reliable Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L.) immune signalling model, extending it with the information from diverse publically available resources. The resulting prior knowledge network (20,012 nodes, 70,091 connections) was then translated to potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and superimposed with an ensemble network inferred from potato time-resolved transcriptomics data. We used different network modelling approaches to generate specific hypotheses of potato immune signalling mechanisms. An interesting finding was the identification of a string of molecular events, illuminating the ethylene pathway modulation of the salicylic acid pathway through NPR1 gene expression. Functional validations confirmed this modulation, thus confirming the potential of our integrative network modelling approach for unravelling molecular mechanisms in complex systems.\\n\\nOne-sentence summaryAnalysis of integrated prior knowledge and ensemble networks highlights a novel connection between ethylene and salicylic acid signalling modules in potato.",
