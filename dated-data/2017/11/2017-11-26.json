    "abstract": "Oxidative stress response in bacteria is generally mediated through coordination between the regulators of oxidant-remediation systems (e.g. OxyR, SoxR) and nucleoid condensation (e.g. Dps, Fis). However, these genetic factors are either absent or rendered nonfunctional in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Therefore, how Mtb organizes genome architecture and regulates gene expression to counterbalance oxidative imbalance during infection is not known. Here, we report that an intracellular redox-sensor, WhiB4, dynamically links genome condensation and oxidative stress response in Mtb. Disruption of WhiB4 affects the expression of genes involved in maintaining redox homeostasis, central carbon metabolism (CCM), respiration, cell wall biogenesis, DNA repair and protein quality control under oxidative stress. Notably, disulfide-linked oligomerization of WhiB4 in response to oxidative stress activates the proteins ability to condense DNA in vitro and in vivo. Further, overexpression of WhiB4 led to hypercondensation of nucleoids, redox imbalance and increased susceptibility to oxidative stress, whereas WhiB4 disruption reversed this effect. In accordance with the findings in vitro, ChIP-Seq data demonstrated non-specific binding of WhiB4 to GC-rich regions of the Mtb genome. Lastly, data indicate that WhiB4 deletion affected the expression of only a fraction of genes preferentially bound by the protein, suggesting its indirect effect on gene expression. We propose that WhiB4 is a novel redox-dependent nucleoid condensing protein that structurally couples Mtbs response to oxidative stress with genome organization and transcription.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) needs to adapt in response to oxidative stress encountered inside human phagocytes. In other bacteria, condensation state of nucleoids modulates gene expression to coordinate oxidative stress response. However, this relation remains elusive in Mtb. We performed molecular dissection of a mechanism controlled by an intracellular redox sensor, WhiB4, in organizing both chromosomal structure and selective expression of adaptive traits to counter oxidative stress in Mtb. Using high-resolution sequencing, transcriptomics, imaging, and redox biosensor, we describe how WhiB4 modulates nucleoid condensation, global gene expression, and redox-homeostasis. WhiB4 over-expression hypercondensed nucleoids and perturbed redox homeostasis whereas WhiB4 disruption had an opposite effect. Our study discovered an empirical role for WhiB4 in integrating redox signals with nucleoid condensation in Mtb.",

    "abstract": "The host antiviral response involves the induction of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines, but also the activation of cell death pathways, including apoptosis, to limit viral replication and spreading. This host defense is strictly regulated to eliminate the infection while limiting tissue damage that is associated with virus pathogenesis. Post-translational modifications, most notably phosphorylation, are key regulators of the antiviral defense implying an important role of protein phosphatases. Here, we investigated the role of the dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) in the host defense against human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a pathogenic virus of the Pneumoviridae family, and Sendai virus (SeV), a model virus being developed as a vector for anti-RSV vaccine. We found that DUSP1 is upregulated before being subjected to proteasomal degradation. DUSP1 does not inhibit the antiviral response, but negatively regulates virus-induced JNK/p38 MAPK phosphorylation. Interaction with the JNK-interacting protein 1 scaffold protein prevents dephosphorylation of JNK by DUSP1, likely explaining that AP-1 activation and downstream cytokine production are protected from DUSP1 inhibition. Importantly, DUSP1 promotes SeV-induced apoptosis and suppresses cell migration in RSV-infected cells. Collectively, our data unveil a previously unrecognized selective role of DUSP1 in the regulation of tissue damage and repair during infections by RSV and SeV.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSea lice are parasitic copepods that cause large economic losses to salmon aquaculture worldwide. Frequent chemotherapeutic treatments are typically required to control this parasite, and alternative measures such as breeding for improved host resistance are desirable. Insight into the host-parasite interaction and mechanisms of host resistance can lead to improvements in selective breeding, and potentially novel treatment targets. In this study, RNA sequencing was used to study the skin transcriptome of Atlantic salmon parasitized with sea lice (C. rogercresseyi). The overall aims were to compare the transcriptomic profile of skin at louse attachment sites and  healthy skin, and to assess differences between animals with varying levels of resistance to the parasite.\\n\\nResultsAtlantic salmon were challenged with C. rogercresseyi, growth and lice count measurements were taken for each fish. 21 animals were selected and RNA-Seq was performed on skin from a louse attachment site, and skin distal to attachment sites for each animal. These animals were classified into family-balanced groups according to the traits of resistance (high vs low lice count), and growth during infestation (an indication of tolerance). Overall comparison of skin from louse attachment sites versus healthy skin showed that 4,355 genes were differentially expressed, indicating local up-regulation of several immune pathways and activation of tissue repair mechanisms. Comparison between resistant and susceptible animals highlighted expression differences in several immune response and pattern recognition genes, and also myogenic and iron availability factors. Genomic regions showing signs of differentiation between resistant and susceptible fish were identified using an Fst analysis.\\n\\nConclusionsComparison of the skin transcriptome between louse attachment sites and healthy skin has yielded a detailed profile of genes and pathways with putative roles in the local host immune response to C. rogercresseyi. The difference in skin gene expression profile between resistant and susceptible animals led to the identification of several immune and myogenic pathways potentially involved in host resistance. Components of these pathways may be targets for studies aimed at improved or novel treatment strategies, or to prioritise candidate functional polymorphisms to enhance genomic selection for host resistance in commercial salmon farming.",

    "abstract": "SummaryPlastid ribosomes are very similar in structure and function to ribosomes of their bacterial ancestors. Since ribosome biogenesis is not thermodynamically favourable at biological conditions, it requires activity of many assembly factors. Here, we have characterized a homolog of bacterial rsgA in Arabidopsis thaliana and show that it can complement the bacterial homolog. Functional characterization of a strong mutant in Arabidopsis revealed that the protein is essential for plant viability, while a weak mutant produced dwarf, chlorotic plants that incorporated immature pre-16S ribosomal RNA into translating ribosomes. Physiological analysis of the mutant plants revealed smaller, but more numerous chloroplasts in the mesophyll cells, reduction of chlorophyll a and b, depletion of proplastids from the rib meristem and decreased photosynthetic electron transport rate and efficiency. Comparative RNA-sequencing and proteomic analysis of the weak mutant and wild-type plants revealed that various biotic stress-related, transcriptional regulation and post-transcriptional modification pathways were repressed in the mutant. Intriguingly, while nuclear- and chloroplast-encoded photosynthesis-related proteins were less abundant in the mutant, the corresponding transcripts were upregulated, suggesting an elaborate compensatory mechanism, potentially via differentially active retrograde signalling pathways. To conclude, this study reveals a new chloroplast ribosome assembly factor and outlines the transcriptomic and proteomic responses of the compensatory mechanism activated during decreased chloroplast function.\\n\\nSignificance statementAtRsgA is an assembly factor necessary for maturation of the small subunit of the chloroplast ribosome. Depletion of AtRsgA leads to dwarfed, chlorotic plants and smaller, but more numerous chloroplasts. Large-scale transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed that chloroplast-encoded and - targeted proteins were less abundant, while the corresponding transcripts were upregulated in the mutant. We analyse the transcriptional responses of several retrograde signalling pathways to suggest a mechanism underlying this compensatory response.",

    "abstract": "Both connectivity and biophysical processes determine the functionality of neuronal networks. We, therefore, develop a real-time framework, called Neural Interactome1, to simultaneously visualize and interact with the structure and dynamics of such networks. Neural Interactome is a cross-platform framework, which combines graph visualization with the simulation of neural dynamics, or experimentally recorded multi neural time series, to allow application of stimuli to neurons to examine network responses. In addition, Neural Interactome supports structural changes, such as disconnection of neurons from the network (ablation feature), as typically done in experiments. Neural dynamics can be explored on a single neuron level (using a zoom feature), back in time (using a review feature) and recorded (using presets feature). We implement the framework using a model of the nervous system of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) nematode, a model organism for which full connectome and neural dynamics have been resolved. We show that Neural Interactome assists in studying neural response patterns associated with locomotion and other stimuli. In particular, we demonstrate how stimulation and ablation help in identifying neurons that shape particular dynamics. We examine scenarios that were experimentally studied, such as touch response circuit, and explore new scenarios that did not undergo elaborate experimental studies. The development of the Neural Interactome was guided by generic concepts to be applicable to neuronal networks with different neural connectivity and dynamics.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEmerging neuroimaging techniques and novel optical interfaces which record and control neural dynamics enable detailed computational connectivity and dynamics models for neurobiological systems. An open question stemming from these advances is how to validate, simulate and apply these models to predict network functionality. Supervised empirical exploration to identify functional stimulations is an elaborate process, and direct computational approach of sequential stimulation is also formidable since produces large amounts of data without clarity on how it can be used to steer toward meaningful functionalities. We therefore develop a platform to inspect network dynamics in real time while preserving structural connectivity properties, displaying the dynamics on a graph, with possibilities to identify functional sub circuits and review the simulated dynamics. The platform allows for real time interactions with the network such as variation of stimuli and performing connectivity changes as neural ablation. We apply the platform to Caenorhabditis elegans nematode nervous system model. We revisit experimentally known scenarios of stimulations and show how our platform helps to detect associated neural dynamic patterns within seconds through few interactions. In addition, we show how the platform could provide novel hypotheses for scenarios that were not yet explored empirically. By implementing the platform with flexibility for changes in connectivity and dynamic models, this work sets forth a generic methodology applicable to various neurobiological systems.",

One reason for the heterogeneity may originate from inter-individual differences in the responses of leukemic cells to endogenous cytokines. On the basis of mathematical modeling, computer simulations and patient data, we have provided evidence that cytokine-independent leukemic cell proliferation is linked to early relapses and poor overall survival. Depending whether the model of cytokine-dependent or cytokine-independent leukemic cell proliferation fits to the clinical data, patients can be assigned to two groups that differ significantly with respect to overall survival. The modeling approach further enables us to identify parameter constellations that can explain unexpected responses of some patients to external cytokines such as blast crisis or remission without chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Investigating variation in gene flow across the genome between closely related species is important to understand how reproductive isolation builds up during the speciation process. An efficient way to characterize differential gene flow is to study how the genetic interactions that take place in hybrid zones selectively filter gene exchange between species, leading to heterogeneous genome divergence. In the present study, genome-wide divergence and introgression patterns were investigated between two sole species, Solea senegalensis and Solea aegyptiaca, using a restriction-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq) approach to analyze samples taken from a transect spanning the hybrid zone. An integrative approach combining geographic and genomic clines methods with an analysis of individual locus introgression taking into account the demographic history of divergence inferred from the joint allele frequency spectrum was conducted. Our results showed that only a minor fraction of the genome can still substantially introgress between the two species due to genome-wide congealing. We found multiple evidence for a preferential direction of introgression in the S. aegyptiaca genetic background, indicating a possible recent or ongoing movement of the hybrid zone. Deviant introgression signals found in the opposite direction supported that the Mediterranean populations of S. senegalensis could have benefited from adaptive introgression. Our study thus illustrates the varied outcomes of genetic interactions between divergent gene pools that recently met after a long history of divergence.",

The etiology of ASD involves both inherited and environmental risk factors, with epigenetic processes hypothesized as one mechanism by which both genetic and non-genetic variation influence gene regulation and pathogenesis.\\n\\nMethodsWe quantified neonatal methylomic variation in 1,263 infants - of whom ~50% went on to subsequently develop ASD - using DNA isolated from a unique collection of archived blood spots taken shortly after birth. We used matched genetic data from the same individuals to examine the molecular consequences of ASD genetic risk variants, identifying methylomic variation associated with elevated polygenic burden for ASD. In addition, we performed DNA methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) mapping to prioritize target genes from ASD GWAS findings.\\n\\nResultsAlthough we did not identify specific loci showing consistent changes in neonatal DNA methylation associated with later ASD, we found a significant association between increased polygenic burden for autism and methylomic variation at two CpG sites located proximal to a robust GWAS signal for ASD on chromosome 8.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study is the largest analysis of DNA methylation in ASD yet undertaken and the first to integrate both genetic and epigenetic variation at birth in ASD.

To comprehensively delineate the inherited basis for plasma Lp(a), we performed deep-coverage whole genome sequencing in 8,392 individuals of European and African American ancestries. Through whole genome variant discovery and direct genotyping of all structural variants overlapping LPA, we quantified the 5.5kb kringle IV-2 copy number (KIV2-CN), a known LPA structural polymorphism, and developed a model for its imputation. Through common variant analysis, we discovered a novel locus (SORT1) associated with Lp(a)-cholesterol, and also genetic modifiers of KIV2-CN. Furthermore, in contrast to previous GWAS studies, we explain most of the heritability of Lp(a), observing Lp(a) to be 85% heritable among African Americans and 75% among Europeans, yet with notable inter-ethnic heterogeneity. Through analyses of aggregates of rare coding and non-coding variants with Lp(a)-cholesterol, we found the only genome-wide significant signal to be at a non-coding SLC22A3 intronic window also previously described to be associated with Lp(a); however, this association was mitigated by adjustment with KIV2-CN. Finally, using an additional imputation dataset (N=27,344), we performed Mendelian randomization of LPA variant classes, finding that genetically regulated Lp(a) is more strongly associated with incident cardiovascular diseases than directly measured Lp(a), and is significantly associated with measures of subclinical atherosclerosis in African Americans.",
