    "abstract": "The processes whereby ecological networks emerge, persist and decay throughout ecosystem development are largely unknown. Here we study networks of plant and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities along a 120,000 yr soil chronosequence, as they undergo assembly (progression) and then disassembly (retrogression). We found that network assembly and disassembly were symmetrical, self-reinforcing processes that together were capable of generating key attributes of network architecture. Plant and AMF species that had short indirect paths to others in the community (i.e. high centrality), rather than many direct interaction partners (i.e. high degree), were best able to attract new interaction partners and in the case of AMF species, also to retain existing interactions with plants during retrogression. We then show using simulations that these non-random patterns of attachment and detachment promote nestedness of the network. These results have implications for predicting extinction sequences, identifying focal points for invasions, and suggesting trajectories for restoration.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) often work cooperatively, where the binding of one TF to DNA enhances the binding affinity of a second TF to a nearby location. Such cooperative binding is important for activating gene expression from promoters and enhancers in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Existing methods to detect cooperative binding of a TF pair rely on analyzing the sequence that is bound. We propose a method that uses, instead, only ChIP-seq peak intensities and an expectation maximization (CPI-EM) algorithm. We validate our method using ChIP-seq data from cells where one of a pair of TFs under consideration has been genetically knocked out. Our algorithm relies on our observation that cooperative TF-TF binding is correlated with weak binding of one of the TFs, which we demonstrate in a variety of cell types, including E. coli, S. cerevisiae and M. musculus cells. We show that this method performs significantly better than a predictor based only on the ChIP-seq peak distance of the TFs under consideration. This suggests that peak intensities contain information that can help detect the cooperative binding of a TF pair. CPI-EM also outperforms an existing sequence-based algorithm in detecting cooperative binding. The CPI-EM algorithm is available at https://github.com/vishakad/cpi-em.",

Although C/D box sRNA genes constitute one of the largest RNA gene families in archaeal thermophiles, most genomes have incomplete sRNA gene annotation because reliable, fully automated detection methods are not available. We expanded and curated a comprehensive gene set across six species of the crenarchaeal genus Pyrobaculum, particularly rich in C/D box sRNA genes. Using high-throughput small RNA sequencing, specialized computational searches, and comparative genomics, we analyzed 526 Pyrobaculum C/D box sRNAs, organizing them into 110 families based on synteny and conservation of guide sequences which determine methylation targets. We examined gene duplications and rearrangements, including one family that has expanded in a pattern similar to retrotransposed repetitive elements in eukaryotes. New training data and inclusion of kink-turn secondary structural features enabled creation of an improved search model. Our analyses provide the most comprehensive, dynamic view of C/D box sRNA evolutionary history within a genus, in terms of modification function, feature plasticity, and gene mobility.",

    "abstract": "Model-averaged partial regression coefficients have been criticized for averaging over a set of models with coefficients that have different meanings from model to model. This criticism arises because statisticians since Fisher believe that the meaning of a coefficient in a regression model arises from probabilistic conditioning (P (Y |X)) and that coefficients are mere descriptors of conditional association (or \\\"differences in conditional means\\\"). Because this association parameter is conditional on a specific set of covariates, the parameter for a predictor varies from model to model. The coefficients in many applied regression models, however, take their meaning from causal conditioning (P (Y |do(X))) and these coefficients estimate causal effect parameters (or simply, causal effects or Average Treatment Effects). Causal effect parameters are also differences in conditional expectations, but the event conditioned on is not the set of covariates in a regression model but a hypothetical intervention. Because an effect parameter for a predictor takes its meaning from causal and not probabilistic conditioning, it is the same from model to model, and an averaged coefficient has a straightforward interpretation as an estimate of a causal effect. But, because the effect parameter is the same from model to model, the estimates of the parameter will generally be biased. By contrast, with probabilistic conditioning, the coefficients are consistent estimates of their parameter in every model. Confounding and omitted variable bias, which are central to explanatory modeling, are meaningless in regression modeling as mere description.",

Starting from the very bottom we are able to build the pieces which when hierarchically and combinatorially combined produce the emergent complex behavior that even a single celled organism can show. Euplotid is composed of a set of quantized geometric 3D building blocks and constantly evolving dockerized bioinformatic pipelines enabling a user to build and interact with the local regulatory architecture of every gene starting from DNA-interactions, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-sequencing. Reads are quantified using the latest computational tools and the results are normalized, quality-checked, and stored. The local regulatory architecture of each gene is built using a Louvain based graph partitioning algorithm parameterized by the chromatin extrusion model and CTCF-CTCF interactions. Cis-Regulatory Elements are defined using chromatin accessibility peaks which are mapped to Transcriptional Start Sites based on inclusion within the same neighborhood. Deep Neural Networks are trained in order to provide a statistical model mimicking transcription factor binding, giving the ability to identify all Transcription Factors within a given chromatin accessibility peak. By in-silico mutating and re-applying the neural network we are able to gauge the impact of a transition mutation on the binding of any transcription factor. The annotated output can be visualized in a variety of 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D ways overlaid with existing bodies of knowledge such as GWAS results or PDB structures. Once a particular CRE of interest has been identified a Base Editor mediated transition mutation can then be performed in a relevant model for further study.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/170159v15_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a55a1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bebb0dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea5b11org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100e735_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 0.1:C_FLOATNO Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

In Caulobacter crescentus, the ParA-ParB-parS system is required for proper chromosome segregation and cell viability. The bacterial centromere-like parS DNA locus is the first to be segregated following chromosome replication. parS is bound by ParB protein, which in turn interacts with ParA to partition the ParB-parS nucleoprotein complex to each daughter cell. Here, we investigated the genome-wide distribution of ParB on the Caulobacter chromosome using a combination of in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) and in vitro DNA affinity purification with deep sequencing (IDAP-seq). We confirmed two previously identified parS sites and discovered at least three more sites that cluster ~8 kb from the origin of replication. We showed that Caulobacter ParB nucleates at parS sites and associates non-specifically with ~10 kb flanking DNA to form a high-order nucleoprotein complex on the left chromosomal arm. Lastly, using transposon mutagenesis coupled with deep sequencing (Tn-seq), we identified a ~500 kb region surrounding the native parS cluster that is tolerable to the insertion of a second parS cluster without severely affecting cell viability. Our results demonstrate that the genomic distribution of parS sites is highly restricted and is crucial for chromosome segregation in Caulobacter.",

    "abstract": "The tangerine pathotype of the ascomycete fungus Alternaria alternata is the causal agent of citrus brown spot, which can result in significant losses of both yield and marketability for tangerines and tangerine hybrids worldwide. A conditionally dispensable chromosome (CDC), which harbors the host-selective ACT toxin gene cluster, is required for tangerine pathogenicity of A. alternata. To understand the genetic makeup and evolution of the tangerine pathotype CDC, we analyzed the function and evolution of the CDC genes present in the A. alternata Z7 strain. The 1.84Mb long CDC contains 512 predicted protein-coding genes, which are enriched in functional categories associated with  metabolic process (132 genes, p-value = 0.00192) including  oxidation-reduction process (48 genes, p-value = 0.00021) and  lipid metabolic process (11 genes, p-value = 0.04591). Relatively few of the CDC genes can be classified as CAZymes (13), kinases (3) and transporters (20). Differential transcriptome analysis of H2O2 treatment and control conditions revealed that 29 CDC genes were significantly up-regulated and 14 were significantly down-regulated, suggesting that CDC genes may play a role in coping with oxidative stress. Evolutionary analysis of the 512 CDC proteins showed that their evolutionary conservation tends to be restricted within the genus Alternaria and that the CDC genes evolve faster than genes in the essential chromosomes. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis suggested that the genes of 13 enzymes and one sugar transporter residing in the CDC were likely horizontally transferred from distantly related species. Among these, one carboxylesterase gene was transferred from bacteria but functionally knocking out this gene revealed no obvious biological role. Another 4 genes might have been transferred from Colletotrichum (Sordariomycetes) and 5 were likely transferred as a physically linked cluster of genes from Cryptococcus (Basidiomycota) or Penicillium (Eurotiomycetes). Functionally knocking out the 5-gene cluster resulted in an 80% decrease in asexual spore production in the deletion mutant. These results provide new insights into the function and evolution of CDC genes in Alternaria.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMany fungal phytopathogens harbor conditionally dispensable chromosomes (CDCs). CDCs are variable in size, contain many genes involved in virulence, but their evolution remains obscure. In this study, we investigated the origin of the CDC present in the tangerine pathotype of Alternaria alternata Z7 strain. We found that most of the Z7 CDC proteins are highly conserved within the genus Alternaria but poorly conserved outside the genus. We also discovered that a small number of genes originated via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) from distantly related fungi and bacteria. These horizontally transferred genes include a carboxylesterase gene that was likely acquired from bacteria, a cluster of 4 physically linked genes likely transferred from Colletotrichum, and a cluster of 5 physically linked genes likely transferred from Cryptococcus (Basidiomycota) or Penicillium (Eurotiomycetes). To gain insight into the functions of these transferred genes, we knocked out the bacterial carboxylesterase and the 5-gene cluster. Whereas the carboxylesterase deletion mutant showed no obvious phenotype, the 5-gene cluster mutant showed a dramatically reduced production of asexual spores (conidia). The results of our study suggest that Alternaria CDCs are largely comprised from rapidly evolving native genes; although only a few genes were acquired via horizontal gene transfer, some of them appear to be involved in functions critical to the phytopathogenic lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Inter-areal functional connectivity (FC), neuronal synchronization in particular, is thought to constitute a key systems-level mechanism for coordination of neuronal processing and communication between brain regions. Evidence to support this hypothesis has been gained largely using invasive electrophysiological approaches. In humans, neuronal activity can be non-invasively recorded only with magneto- and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG), which have been used to assess FC networks with high temporal resolution and whole-scalp coverage. However, even in source-reconstructed MEG/EEG data, signal mixing, or \\\"source leakage\\\", is a significant confounder for FC analyses and network localization.\\n\\nSignal mixing leads to two distinct kinds of false-positive observations: artificial interactions (AI) caused directly by mixing and spurious interactions (SI) arising indirectly from the spread of signals from true interacting sources to nearby false loci. To date, several interaction metrics have been developed to solve the AI problem, but the SI problem has remained largely intractable in MEG/EEG all-to-all source connectivity studies. Here, we advance a novel approach for correcting SIs in FC analyses using source-reconstructed MEG/EEG data.\\n\\nOur approach is to bundle observed FC connections into hyperedges by their adjacency in signal mixing. Using realistic simulations, we show here that bundling yields hyperedges with good separability of true positives and little loss in the true positive rate. Hyperedge bundling thus significantly decreases graph noise by minimizing the false-positive to true-positive ratio. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of edge bundling in the visualization of large-scale cortical networks with real MEG data. We propose that hypergraphs yielded by bundling represent well the set of true cortical interactions that are detectable and dissociable in MEG/EEG connectivity analysis.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIA true interaction often is \\\"ghosted\\\" into a multitude of spurious edges (SI)\\nC_LIO_LIEffective in controlling and illustrating SI\\nC_LIO_LIHyperedges have much improved TPR and graph quality\\nC_LIO_LIAdvantages in visualizing connectivity\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The platypus is an egg-laying mammal which, alongside the echidna, occupies a unique place in the mammalian phylogenetic tree. Despite widespread interest in its unusual biology, little is known about its population structure or recent evolutionary history. To provide new insights into the dispersal and demographic history of this iconic species, we sequenced the genomes of 57 platypuses from across the whole species range in eastern mainland Australia and Tasmania. Using a highly-improved reference genome, we called over 6.7M SNPs, providing an informative genetic data set for population analyses. Our results show very strong population structure in the platypus, with our sampling locations corresponding to discrete groupings between which there is no evidence for recent gene flow. Genome-wide data allowed us to establish that 28 of the 57 sampled individuals had at least a third-degree relative amongst other samples from the same river, often taken at different times. Taking advantage of a sampled family quartet, we estimated the de novo mutation rate in the platypus at 7.0x10-9/bp/generation (95% CI 4.1x10-9 - 1.2x10-8/bp/generation). We estimated effective population sizes of ancestral populations and haplotype sharing between current groupings, and found evidence for bottlenecks and long-term population decline in multiple regions, and early divergence between populations in different regions. This study demonstrates the power of whole-genome sequencing for studying natural populations of an evolutionarily important species.",

PanINs normally take months to form, but can be rapidly induced by genetic deletion of acinar cell differentiation factors such as Ptf1a, suggesting that loss of mature cell identity is a rate-limiting step in pancreatic tumor initiation. Using a novel genetic mouse model that allows for independent control of oncogenic Kras and Ptf1a expression, we demonstrate that maintained activity of Ptf1a is sufficient to eliminate Kras-driven tumorigenesis, even in the presence of tumor-promoting inflammation. Furthermore, reintroduction of Ptf1a into established PanINs reverts their phenotype in vivo. Our results suggest that reactivation of an endogenous differentiation program can prevent and reverse oncogenesis in cells harboring tumor driving mutations, thus introducing a novel paradigm for solid tumor prevention and treatment.",

However, the underlying mechanisms of cell matching that instruct these connections remain elusive. Here, we explore the dynamic regulation of matching processes utilizing Drosophila cardiogenesis. During embryonic heart formation, cardioblasts (CBs) form precise contacts with their partners after long-range migration. We find that CB matching is highly robust at the boundaries between distinct CB subtypes. Filopodia in these CB subtypes have different binding affinities. We identify the adhesion molecules Fasciclin III (Fas3) and Ten-m as having complementary differential expression in CBs. Altering Fas3 expression influences the CB filopodia selective binding activities and CB matching. In contrast to single knockouts, loss of both Fas3 and Ten-m dramatically impairs CB alignment. We propose that differential expression of adhesion molecules mediates selective filopodia binding, and these molecules work in concert to instruct precise and robust cell matching.",

Theory predicts that, under outcrossing, an allele conferring greater pollen competitive ability should fix within a population unless antagonistic pleiotropy with the sporophyte stage is strong. However, under strong selfing, pollen competitiveness is immaterial as superior and inferior competitors are deposited on opposite stigmas, producing assortative competition. Because many plant species have mixed-mating systems, selfing should be critical in the spread and maintenance of pollen-expressed genes affecting competitiveness. We present two one-locus, two-allele population genetic models for the evolution of a locus controlling pleiotropic antagonism between pollen competitiveness and diploid fitness. Analytical solutions provide minimum and maximum selfing rates allowing invasion of alleles with greater diploid and haploid fitness respectively. Further, polymorphism is only maintained when diploid selection is recessive. Fixation of the allele conferring greater pollen competitiveness may be prevented, even with weak sporophytic counter-selection, with sufficiently high selfing. Finally, selfing expands and limits the range of haploid-diploid selection coefficients allowing polymorphism, depending on dominance and selfing mode.",

    "abstract": "Binocular disparity results in a tangible subjective experience of three-dimensional world, but whether disparity also augments objective perceptual performance remains debated. We hypothesized that the improved coding of depth enabled by binocular disparity allows participants to individuate more object at a glance as the objects can be more efficiently differentiated from each other and the background. We asked participants to enumerate objects in briefly presented naturalistic (Experiment 1) and artificial (Experiment 2) scenes in immersive virtual reality. This type of enumeration task yields well-documented capacity limits where up to 3-4 items can be enumerated rapidly and accurately, known as subitizing. Our results show that although binocular disparity did not yield a large general improvement in enumeration accuracy or reaction times, it improved participants ability to process the items right after the limit of perceptual capacity. Binocular disparity also sped-up response times by 27 ms on average when artificial stimuli (cubes) were used. Interestingly, the influence of disparity on subjectively experienced depth revealed a clearly different pattern than the influence of disparity on objective performance. This suggests that the functional and subjective sides of stereopsis can be dissociated. Altogether our results suggest that binocular disparity may increase the number of items the visual system can simultaneously process. This may help animals to better resolve and track objects in complex, cluttered visual environments.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which small RNA (sRNA) regulators select and prioritize target mRNAs remain poorly understood, but serve to promote efficient responses to environmental cues and stresses. We sought to uncover mechanisms that establish regulatory hierarchy for a model sRNA, SgrS, found in enteric bacteria and produced under conditions of metabolic stress when sugar transport and metabolism are unbalanced. SgrS post-transcriptionally controls a nine-gene regulon to restore growth and homeostasis under stress conditions. An in vivo reporter system was used to quantify SgrS-dependent regulation of target genes and established that SgrS exhibits a clear preference for certain targets, and regulates those targets efficiently even at low SgrS levels. Higher SgrS concentrations are required to regulate other targets. The position of targets in the regulatory hierarchy is not well-correlated with the predicted thermodynamic stability of SgrS-mRNA interactions or the SgrS-mRNA binding affinity as measured in vitro. Detailed analyses of SgrS interaction with asd mRNA demonstrate that SgrS binds cooperatively to two sites and remodels asd mRNA secondary structure. SgrS binding at both sites increases the efficiency of asd mRNA regulation compared to mutants that have only a single SgrS binding site. Our results suggest that sRNA selection of target mRNAs and regulatory hierarchy are influenced by several molecular features. The sRNA-mRNA interaction, including the number and position of sRNA binding sites on the mRNA and cofactors like the RNA chaperone Hfq, seem to tune the efficiency of regulation of specific mRNA targets.\\n\\nIMPORTANCETo survive, bacteria must respond rapidly to stress and simultaneously maintain metabolic homeostasis. The small RNA (sRNA) SgrS mediates the response to stress arising from imbalanced sugar transport and metabolism. To coordinate the stress response, SgrS regulates genes involved in sugar uptake and metabolism. Intrinsic properties of sRNAs such as SgrS allow them to regulate extensive networks of genes. To date, sRNA regulation of targets has largely been studied in the context of \\\"one sRNA-one target\\\", and little is known about coordination of multi-gene regulons and sRNA regulatory network structure. Here, we explore the molecular basis for regulatory hierarchy in sRNA regulons. Our results reveal a complex interplay of factors that influence the outcome of sRNA regulation. The number and location of sRNA binding sites on mRNA targets and the participation of an RNA chaperone dictate prioritized regulation of targets to promote an efficient response to stress.",

    "abstract": "Comparing models facilitates testing different hypotheses regarding the computational basis of perception and action. Effective model comparison requires stimuli for which models make different predictions. Typically, experiments use a predetermined set of stimuli or sample stimuli randomly. Both methods have limitations; a predetermined set may not contain stimuli that dissociate the models whereas random sampling may be inefficient. To overcome these limitations, we expanded the psi-algorithm (Kontsevich & Tyler, 1999) from estimating the parameters of a psychometric curve to distinguishing models. To test our algorithm, we applied it to two distinct problems. First, we investigated dissociating sensory noise models. We simulated ideal observers with different noise models performing a 2-afc task. Stimuli were selected randomly or using our algorithm. We found using our algorithm improved the accuracy of model comparison. We also validated the algorithm in subjects by inferring which noise model underlies speed perception. Our algorithm converged quickly to the model previously proposed (Stocker & Simoncelli, 2006), whereas if stimuli were selected randomly model probabilities separated slower and sometimes supported alternative models. Second, we applied our algorithm to a different problem; comparing models of target selection under body acceleration. Previous work found target choice preference is modulated by whole body acceleration (Rincon-Gonzalez et al., 2016). However, the effect is subtle making model comparison difficult. We show that selecting stimuli adaptively could have led to stronger conclusions in model comparison. We conclude that our technique is more efficient and more reliable than current methods of stimulus selection for dissociating models.\\n\\nData AvailabilityAll data and code will be posted on our institutional repository system following acceptance.

    "abstract": "Optical recordings of neural activity in behaving animals can reveal the neural correlates of decision making, but such recordings are compromised by brain motion that often accompanies behavior. Two-photon point scanning microscopy is especially sensitive to motion artifacts, and to date, two-photon recording of activity has required rigid mechanical coupling between the brain and microscope. To overcome these difficulties, we developed a two-photon tracking microscope with extremely low latency (360 s) feedback implemented in hardware. We maintained continuous focus on neurons moving with velocities of 3 mm/s and accelerations of 1 m/s2 both in-plane and axially, allowing high-bandwidth measurements with modest excitation power. We recorded from motor- and inter-neurons in unrestrained freely behaving fruit fly larvae, correlating neural activity with stimulus presentation and behavioral outputs. Our technique can be extended to stabilize recordings in a variety of moving substrates.",

    "abstract": "Clinicians rely heavily on stereoacuity to measure binocular visual function, but stereo-vision represents only one aspect of binocularity. Lab-based tests of sensory eye dominance (SED) are commonplace, but have not been translated to wider clinical practice. Here we compare several methods of quantifying SED in a format suitable for clinical use. We tested 30 participants with ostensibly normal vision on 8 tests. Seven tests (#1-7) were designed to quantify SED in the form of an interocular balance-point (BP). In tests #1-6, we estimated a contrast-BP, the interocular difference in contrast required for observers to be equally likely to base their judgement on either eye, whereas in test #7 we measured binocular rivalry (interocular ratio of sensory dominance duration). We compare test-retest reliability (intra-observer consistency) and test-validity (inter-observer discriminatory power) and compare BP to stereoacuity (test #8). The test that best preserved inter-observer differences in contrast balance while maintaining good test-retest reliability was a polarity judgement using superimposed opposite-contrast polarity same-identity optotypes. A reliable and valid measure of SED can be obtained rapidly (20 trials) using a simple contrast-polarity judgement. Tests that use polarity-rivalrous stimuli elicit more reliable judgments than those that do not.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAlthough sensory eye dominance is central to understanding normal and disordered binocular vision, there is currently no consensus as to the best way to measure it. Here we compare several candidate measures of sensory eye dominance and conclude that a reliable measure of SED can be achieved rapidly using a judgement of stimulus contrast-polarity.",

    "abstract": "The neocortex is composed of six anatomically and physiologically specialized layers. It has been proposed that integration of activity across cortical areas is mediated anatomically by associative connections terminating in superficial layers, and physiologically by slow cortical rhythms. However, the means through which neocortical anatomy and physiology interact to coordinate neural activity remains obscure. Using laminar microelectrode arrays in 19 human participants, we found that most EEG activity is below 10-Hz (delta/theta) and generated by superficial cortical layers during both wakefulness and sleep. Cortical surface grid, grid-laminar, and dual-laminar recordings demonstrate that these slow rhythms are synchronous within upper layers across broad cortical areas. The phase of this superficial slow activity is reset by infrequent stimuli and coupled to the amplitude of faster oscillations and neuronal firing across all layers. These findings support a primary role of superficial slow rhythms in generating the EEG and integrating cortical activity.",

    "abstract": "Tooth root grooves and other ante-mortem dental tissue loss not associated with caries found on or near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) are commonly termed non-carious cervical lesions. Three main processes are implicated in forming these lesions: abrasion, dental erosion, and abfraction. As yet, these lesions have not been described in non-Homo hominins. In this study South African fossil hominin collections were examined for evidence of any type of non-carious cervical lesion. Only one individual shows ante-mortem root grooves consistent with non-carious cervical lesions. Two teeth, a mandibular right permanent lateral incisor (STW 270) and canine (STW 213), belonging to the same Australopithecus africanus individual, show clear ante-mortem grooves on the labial root surface. These lesions start below the CEJ, extend over a third of the way toward the apex, and taper to a point towards the lingual side. Microscopic examination revealed no clear directional striations. The shape of these grooves is extremely similar to clinical examples of dental erosion, with the lack of striations supporting this diagnosis. These are the oldest hominin examples of non-carious cervical lesions and first described in a genus other than Homo; further, the lesions suggest that this individual regularly consumed or processed acidic food items.",

    "abstract": "Dental pathology and wear data can provide valuable insights into diet, cultural practices, and the health of populations. In this study, various dental pathologies and types of wear were recorded for 41 individuals (914 permanent teeth), excavated from the medieval cemetery of St. Owens Church in Southgate Street, Gloucester. Teeth were studied macroscopically with a 10x hand lens to confirm the presence of specific pathologies. Relatively high rates of antemortem chipping on the anterior teeth, and the presence of maxillary central incisor notches, suggested that the Gloucester population commonly used their teeth for non-masticatory activities. Abscessing and antemortem tooth loss fell within previously reported ranges for British medieval sites (2.6% and 6% respectively). However, the sample exhibits extremely high levels of carious lesions and calculus. Nearly 24% of teeth have at least one carious lesion, and the presence of calculus was recorded in 74% of teeth within the sample. Overall caries frequency is similar to sites from later time periods. This frequency may reflect Gloucesters location as a large port town. Remains from the same area, but the earlier Roman period, also shows high rates of both caries and calculus, suggesting a continuation of consuming certain cariogenic foods is likely.",

    "abstract": "Clinical interpretation of human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants has been challenging for technical and biological reasons but the involvement of dysfunctional mitochondria in many diseases makes it imperative to have a validated assay for detecting pathogenic variants. We have tested several methods to identify those best suited to detect and confirm mtDNA variants. The choice of methods is dependent on the amount of DNA available for testing and the sensitivity required for detecting low-level heteroplasmies. There is a tradeoff between a polymerases ability to amplify small amounts of DNA and its ability to generate accurate sequence. We report a simple method to measure heteroplasmy levels of large deletions from NGS data alone without need for qPCR or other methods. Use of HapMap samples for standardization needs to be done with caution as most have novel heteroplasmic sites that have arisen during immortalization/cell culture processes. Different batches of DNA can have variable sequence. In contrast, we observed no de novo heteroplasmies in healthy mother-child pairs studied using blood or saliva though the frequency of pre-existing heteroplasmies often changed dramatically across generations. Long-read nanopore sequencing of individuals with two heteroplasmies suggested a random distribution of variants on single molecules but technical artifacts prevent certainty on this finding. Urine provides an additional readily accessible source of mtDNA that can be used for bone marrow transplant recipients whose saliva/blood mtDNA may be contaminated by the BMT donors mtDNA. We have characterized cells suspended in urine via expression profiling and shown them to be primarily mucosal cells that are independent of blood. Understanding the pitfalls of the various mtDNA sequencing methods allows development of reliable and accurate tests suitable for clinical diagnostics.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMitochondrial DNA is important for many diseases but it is present at many copies per cell so is harder to check for mutations compared to nuclear DNA. We have studied mitochondrial DNA in different ways to see how it changes across generations and in different locations in the body. The tests need to be much more sensitive than nuclear DNA tests so that we can detect mutations down to 1%. We have shown that mitochondrial DNA changes when cell lines are used but saliva, blood and cells in the urine can all be used for testing. Cells in the urine originate as mucosal cells and are independent of blood. We developed a new method for analyzing large deletions that means sequencing data alone can be used for measuring the frequency of deletions. We also followed a family with two variable sites to better understand how mitochondrial DNA changes from mother to child. In some children, the variants stayed the same while, in others, variants disappeared.",
