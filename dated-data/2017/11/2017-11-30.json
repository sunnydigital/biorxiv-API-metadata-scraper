    "abstract": "Invertebrates can be sampled using any of several well-established, rapid and cost-effective methods for documenting species richness and composition. Despite their many differences, different orders of arachnids have been often sampled together in various studies. Active nocturnal search has been long considered the most efficient method for sampling spiders and harvestmen in tropical forests. We compared the number of species and composition of spiders and harvestmen simultaneously sampled using three sampling methods: beating tray, active nocturnal search and Winkler traps at areas along the Urucu River, Coari, Amazonas. We found that a reasonable inventorying of harvestmen can be accomplished solely by nocturnal search, whereas the beating tray and Winkler approaches are redundant. For spiders, both the nocturnal and beating tray methods were complementary and are needed to provide a more complete picture of spider assemblages. An inventory based solely on nocturnal search saves 75% of the survey costs for harvestmen assemblages and 46% for spider assemblages. Based on our findings we propose that different taxonomic groups (e.g. harvestmen and spiders) should be sampled separately in tropical forests, especially for monitoring purposes, and different sets of methods should be combined for each according to their most efficient and best cost-benefit performance.",

    "abstract": "We present THiCweed, a new approach to analyzing transcription factor binding data from high-throughput chromatin-immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments. THiCweed clusters bound regions based on sequence similarity using a divisive hierarchical clustering approach based on sequence similarity within sliding windows, while exploring both strands. ThiCweed is specially geared towards data containing mixtures of motifs, which present a challenge to traditional motif-finders. Our implementation is significantly faster than standard motif-finding programs, able to process 30,000 peaks in 1-2 hours, on a single CPU core of a desktop computer. On synthetic data containing mixtures of motifs it is as accurate or more accurate than all other tested programs.\\n\\nTHiCweed performs best with large \\\"window\\\" sizes ([&ge;] 50bp), much longer than typical binding sites (7-15 base pairs). On real data it successfully recovers literature motifs, but also uncovers complex sequence characteristics in flanking DNA, variant motifs, and secondary motifs even when they occur in < 5% of the input, all of which appear biologically relevant. We also find recurring sequence patterns across diverse ChIP-seq data sets, possibly related to chromatin architecture and looping. THiCweed thus goes beyond traditional motif-finding to give new insights into genomic TF binding complexity.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in genome resequencing have led to increased interest in prediction of the functional consequences of genetic variants. Variants at phylogenetically conserved sites are of particular interest, because they are more likely than variants at phylogenetically variable sites to have deleterious effects on fitness and contribute to phenotypic variation. Numerous comparative genomic approaches have been developed to predict deleterious variants, but the approaches are nearly always assessed based on their ability to identify known disease-causing mutations in humans. Determining the accuracy of deleterious variant predictions in nonhuman species is important to understanding evolution, domestication, and potentially to improving crop quality and yield. To examine our ability to predict deleterious variants in plants we generated a curated database of 2,910 Arabidopsis thaliana mutants with known phenotypes. We evaluated seven approaches and found that while all performed well, their relative ranking differed from prior benchmarks in humans. We conclude that deleterious mutations can be reliably predicted in A. thaliana and likely other plant species, but that the relative performance of various approaches does not necessarily translate from one species to another.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine underlies important aspects of cognition, and has been suggested to boost cognitive performance. However, how dopamine modulates the large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance has remained elusive. Using functional MRI during a working memory task in healthy young human listeners (N=22), we investigated the effect of levodopa (L-dopa) on two aspects of cortical dynamics, blood oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal variability and the functional connectome of large-scale cortical networks. We here show that enhanced dopaminergic signaling modulates the two potentially interrelated aspects of large-scale cortical dynamics during cognitive performance, and the degree of these modulations is able to explain inter-individual differences in L-dopa-induced behavioral benefits. Relative to placebo, L-dopa increased BOLD signal variability in task-relevant temporal, inferior frontal, parietal and cingulate regions. On the connectome level, however, L-dopa diminished functional integration across temporal and cingulo-opercular regions. This hypo-integration was expressed as a reduction in network efficiency and modularity in more than two thirds of the participants and to different degrees. Hypo-integration co-occurred with relative hyper-connectivity in paracentral lobule and precuneus, as well as posterior putamen. Both, L-dopa-induced BOLD signal variability modulation and functional connectome modulations proved predictive of an individuals L-dopa-induced gain in behavioral performance, namely response speed and perceptual sensitivity. Lastly, L-dopa-induced modulations of BOLD signal variability were correlated with L-dopa-induced modulation of nodal connectivity and network efficiency. Our findings underline the role of dopamine in maintaining the dynamic range of, and communication between, cortical systems, and their explanatory power for inter-individual differences in benefits from dopamine during cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "The ends of linear chromosomes, the telomeres, comprise repetitive DNA sequences that are protected by the shelterin protein complex. Cancer cells need to extend these telomere repeats for their unlimited proliferation, either by reactivating the reverse transcriptase telomerase or by using the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway. The different telomere maintenance (TM) mechanisms appear to involve hundreds of proteins but their telomere repeat length related activities are only partly understood. Currently, a database that integrates information on TM relevant genes is missing. To provide a reference for studies that dissect TM features, we here introduce the TelNet database at http://www.cancertelsys.org/telnet/. It offers a comprehensive compilation of more than 2,000 human and over 1,100 yeast genes linked to telomere maintenance. These genes were annotated in terms of TM mechanism, associated specific functions and orthologous genes, a TM significance score and information from peer-reviewed literature. This TM information can be retrieved via different search and view modes and evaluated for a set of genes on a statistics page. With these features TelNet can be integrated into the annotation of genes identified from bioinformatics analysis pipelines to determine possible connections with TM networks as illustrated by an exemplary application. We anticipate that TelNet will be a helpful resource for researchers that study TM processes.",

    "abstract": "Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a direct measure of neuronal current flow; its anatomical resolution is therefore not constrained by physiology but rather by data quality and the models used to explain these data. Recent simulation work has shown that it is possible to distinguish between signals arising in the deep and superficial cortical laminae given accurate knowledge of these surfaces with respect to the MEG sensors. This previous work has focused around a single inversion scheme (multiple sparse priors) and a single global parametric fit metric (free energy). In this paper we use several different source inversion algorithms and both local and global, as well as parametric and non-parametric fit metrics in order to demonstrate the robustness of the discrimination between layers. We find that only algorithms with some sparsity constraint can successfully be used to make laminar discrimination. Importantly, local t-statistics, global cross-validation and free energy all provide robust and mutually corroborating metrics of fit. We show that discrimination accuracy is affected by patch size estimates, cortical surface features, and lead field strength, which suggests several possible future improvements to this technique. This study demonstrates the possibility of determining the laminar origin of MEG sensor activity, and thus directly testing theories of human cognition that involve laminar- and frequency- specific mechanisms. This possibility can now be achieved using recent developments in high precision MEG, most notably the use of subject-specific head-casts, which allow for significant increases in data quality and therefore anatomically precise MEG recordings.",

    "abstract": "When weighing evidence for a decision, individuals are continually faced with the choice of whether to gather more information or act on what has already been learned. The present experiment employed a self-paced category learning task and fMRI to examine the neural mechanisms underlying stopping of information search and how they contribute to choice accuracy. Participants learned to classify triads of face, object, and scene cues into one of two categories using a rule based on one of the stimulus dimensions. After each trial, participants were given the option to explicitly solve the rule or continue learning. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to examine activation of rule-relevant information on trials leading up to a decision to solve the rule. We found that activation of rule-relevant information increased leading up to participants stopping decisions. Stopping was associated with widespread activation that included medial prefrontal cortex and visual association areas. Engagement of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was associated with accurate stopping, and activation in this region was functionally coupled with signal in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Results suggest that activating rule information when deciding whether to stop an information search increases choice accuracy, and that the response profile of vmPFC during such decisions may provide an index of effective learning.",

Many large-scale genetic association studies are performing CNV analysis using whole exome sequencing (WES) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). In many of these studies, previous SNP-array data are available. An integrated cross-platform analysis is expected to improve resolution and accuracy, yet there is no tool for effectively combining data from sequencing and array platforms. The detection of CNVs using sequencing data alone can also be further improved by the utilization of allele-specific reads.\\n\\nResultsWe propose a statistical framework, integrated Copy Number Variation detection algorithm (iCNV), which can be applied to multiple study designs: WES only, WGS only, SNP array only, or any combination of SNP and sequencing data. iCNV applies platform specific normalization, utilizes allele specific reads from sequencing and integrates matched NGS and SNP-array data by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). We compare integrated two-platform CNV detection using iCNV to naive intersection or union of platforms and show that iCNV increases sensitivity and robustness. We also assess the accuracy of iCNV on WGS data only, and show that the utilization of allele-specific reads improve CNV detection accuracy compared to existing methods.\\n\\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/zhouzilu/iCNV\\n\\nContactnzh@wharton.upenn.edu, zhouzilu@mail.med.upenn.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Human immunity influences the evolution and impact of novel influenza strains. Because individuals are infected with multiple influenza strains during their lifetime and each virus can generate a cross-reactive antibody response, it is challenging to quantify the processes that shape observed immune responses, or to reliably detect recent infection from serological samples. Using a Bayesian model of antibody dynamics at multiple timescales, we explain complex cross-reactive antibody landscapes by inferring participants histories of infection with serological data from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies of influenza A/H3N2 in southern China and Vietnam. We show an individuals influenza antibody profile can be explained by a short-lived, broadly cross-reactive response that decays within a year to leave a smaller long-term response acting against a narrower range of strains. We also demonstrate that accounting for dynamic immune responses can provide a more accurate alternative to traditional definitions seroconversion for the estimation of infection attack rates. Our work provides a general model for explaining mechanisms of influenza immunity acting at multiple timescales based on contemporary serological data, and suggests a two-armed immune response to influenza infection consistent with competitive dynamics between B cell populations. This approach to analysing multiple timescales for antigenic responses could also be applied to other multi-strain pathogens such as dengue and related flaviviruses.",

    "abstract": "Most functional transcription factor (TF) binding sites deviate from their \\\"consensus\\\" recognition motif, although their sites and flanking sequences are often conserved across species. Here, we used single-molecule DNA unzipping with optical tweezers to study how Egr-1, a TF harbouring 3 zinc fingers (ZF1,ZF2 and ZF3), is modulated by the sequence and context of its functional sites in the Lhb gene promoter. We find that both the core 9 base pairs bound to Egr-1 in each of the sites, and the base pairs flanking them, modulate the affinity and structure of the protein-DNA complex. The effect of the flanking sequences is asymmetric, with a stronger effect for the sequence flanking ZF3. Characterization of the dissociation time of Egr-1 revealed that a local, mechanical perturbation of the interactions of ZF3 destabilizes the complex more effectively than a perturbation of the ZF1 interactions. Our results reveal a novel role for ZF3 in the interaction of Egr-1 with other proteins and the DNA, providing insight on the regulation of Lhb and other genes by Egr-1. Moreover, our findings reveal the potential of small changes in DNA sequence to alter transcriptional regulation, and may shed light on the organization of regulatory elements at promoters.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the amount and infectiousness of influenza virus shed into exhaled breath. This contributes to uncertainty about the importance of airborne influenza transmission. We screened 355 symptomatic volunteers with acute respiratory illness and report 142 cases with confirmed influenza infection who provided 218 paired nasopharyngeal (NP) and 30-minute breath samples (coarse >5 m and fine <5 m fractions) on days 1 to 3 post symptom onset. We assessed viral RNA copy number for all samples and cultured NP swabs and fine aerosols. We recovered infectious virus from 52 (39%) of the fine aerosols and 150 (89%) of the NP swabs with valid cultures. The geometric mean RNA copy numbers were 3.8x104/30-min fine, 1.2x104/30-min coarse aerosol sample, and 8.2x108 per NP swab. Fine and coarse aerosol viral RNA was positively associated with body mass index (fine p<0.05, coarse p<0.10) and number of coughs (fine p<0.001, coarse p<0.01) and negatively associated with increasing days since symptom onset (fine p<0.05 to p<0.01, coarse p<0.10) in adjusted models. Fine aerosol viral RNA was also positively associated with having influenza vaccination for both the current and prior season (p<0.01). NP swab viral RNA was positively associated with upper respiratory symptoms (p<0.01) and negatively associated with age (p<0.01) but was not significantly associated with fine or coarse aerosol viral RNA or their predictors. Sneezing was rare, and sneezing and coughing were not necessary for infectious aerosol generation. Our observations suggest that influenza infection in the upper and lower airways are compartmentalized and independent.\\n\\nSignificanceLack of human data on influenza virus aerosol shedding fuels debate over the importance of airborne transmission. We provide overwhelming evidence that humans generate infectious aerosols and quantitative data to improve mathematical models of transmission and public health interventions. We show that sneezing is rare and not important for, and that coughing is not required for influenza virus aerosolization. Our findings, that upper and lower airway infection are independent and that fine particle exhaled aerosols reflect infection in the lung, open a new pathway for understanding the human biology of influenza infection and transmission. Our observation of an association between repeated vaccination and increased viral aerosol generation demonstrated the power of our method, but needs confirmation.",

Superresolution imaging revealed that V{beta}3 integrin preferred binding to Vn under various conditions. In contrast, binding to Fn required mechanical load on V{beta}3 integrin. Integrin mutations, structural analysis, and molecular dynamics simulations established a model where the extended-closed conformation of V{beta}3 integrin binds Vn but not Fn. Force-mediated hybrid domain swing-out characterizes the extended-open conformation needed for efficient Fn binding. Thus, force-dependent conformational changes in V{beta}3 integrin increase the number of available ligands and therefore the ligand promiscuity of this integrin.

    "abstract": "Protein self-assemblies modulate protein activities over biological time scales that can exceed the lifetimes of the proteins or even the cells that harbor them. We hypothesized that these time scales relate to kinetic barriers inherent to the nucleation of ordered phases. To investigate nucleation barriers in living cells, we developed Distributed Amphifluoric FRET (DAmFRET). DAmFRET exploits a photoconvertible fluorophore, heterogeneous expression, and large cell numbers to quantify via flow cytometry the extent of a proteins self-assembly as a function of cellular concentration. We show that kinetic barriers limit the nucleation of ordered self-assemblies, and that the persistence of the barriers with respect to concentration relates to structure. Supersaturation resulting from sequence-encoded nucleation barriers gave rise to prion behavior, and enabled a prion-forming protein, Sup35 PrD, to partition into dynamic intracellular condensates or to form toxic aggregates. Our results suggest that nucleation barriers govern cytoplasmic inheritance, subcellular organization, and proteotoxicity.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIDistributed Amphifluoric FRET (DAmFRET) quantifies nucleation in living cells\\nC_LIO_LIDAmFRET rapidly distinguishes prion-like from non-prion phase transitions\\nC_LIO_LINucleation barriers allow switch-like temporal control of protein activity\\nC_LIO_LISequence-intrinsic features determine the concentration-dependence of nucleation barriers\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Formation and segregation of the cell lineages forming the vertebrate heart have been studied extensively by genetic cell tracing techniques and by analysis of single marker gene expression both in embryos and differentiating ES cells. However, the underlying gene regulatory networks driving cell fate transitions during early cardiogenesis is only partially understood, in part due to limited cell numbers and substantial cellular heterogeneity within the early embryo. Here, we comprehensively characterized cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) marked by Nkx2-5 and Isl1 expression from embryonic days E7.5 to E9.5 using single-cell RNA sequencing. By leveraging on cell-to-cell heterogeneity, we identified different previously unknown cardiac sub-populations. Reconstruction of the developmental trajectory revealed that Isl1+ CPC represent a transitional cell population maintaining a prolonged multipotent state, whereas extended expression of Nkx-2.5 commits CPC to a unidirectional cardiomyocyte fate. Correlation-based analysis of cells in the unstable multipotent state uncovered underlying gene regulatory networks associated with differentiation. Furthermore, we show that CPC fate transitions are associated with distinct open chromatin states, which critically depend on Isl1 for accessibility of enhancers. In contrast, forced expression of Nkx2-5 eliminated multipotency of Isl1+ cells and established a unidirectional cardiomyocyte fate. Our data provides a transcriptional map for early cardiogenic events at single-cell resolution and establishes a general model of transcriptional and epigenetic regulations during cardiac progenitor cell fate decisions.",

    "abstract": "Insects use species-specific sex pheromone blends to attract members of the opposite sex which express the corresponding molecular receptors. Given this lock and key mechanism used for species identification and mate choice, it is currently not well understood how pheromone blends or receptor systems evolve. One possibility is that insects develop preferences for new sex pheromone blends via the process of learning, and that these learned preferences may be passed on to the next generation. We tested these hypotheses by exposing newly emerged Bicyclus anynana female butterflies to either wild type or to modified male sex pheromone blends. A few days later, we scored female mating outcome in a choice trial involving both male types. We also assessed the mating outcome of naive offspring of females that underwent distinct odor learning trials to test for a potential inheritance of learned odor preferences. Naive (parental) females mated preferentially with Wt-blend males, but females pre-exposed to new blends either shifted their preference to new-blend males, or mated equally with males of either blend type; the response depending on the new blend they were introduced to. Naive daughters of females who were exposed to new-blend males behaved similarly to their experienced mothers. We demonstrate that females are able to learn preferences for novel pheromone blends in response to a short social experience, and pass that learned preference down to the next generation. This suggests that learning can be a key factor in the evolution of sex pheromone blend recognition and in chemosensory speciation.\\n\\nSignificance statementWhile the diversity of sex pheromone communication systems across insects is well documented, the mechanisms that lead to such diversity are not well understood. Sex pheromones constitute a species-specific system of sexual communication that reinforces interspecific reproductive isolation. When odor blends evolve, the efficacy of male-female communication becomes compromised, unless preference for novel blends also evolves. We explore odor learning as a possible mechanism leading to changes in sex pheromone preferences. We show that preferences for new blends can develop following a short learning experience, and that these novel preferences can be transmitted to the next generation. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation of sex pheromone blend preference learning impacting mate choice and being inherited in an insect.",

    "abstract": "Speech is a critical form of human communication and is central to our daily lives. Yet, despite decades of study, an understanding of the fundamental neural control of speech production remains incomplete. Current theories model speech production as a hierarchy from sentences and phrases down to words, syllables, speech sounds (phonemes) and the movements of speech articulator muscles used to produce these sounds (articulatory gestures). Here, we investigate the cortical representation of articulatory gestures and phonemes in speech motor, premotor, and inferior frontal cortices. Our results indicate that primary motor and premotor areas represent gestures to a greater extent than phonemes, while inferior frontal cortex represents both gestures and phonemes. These findings suggest that the cortical control of speech production shares a common representation with that of other types of movement, such as arm and hand movements.",

    "abstract": "Lower frequency, feedback, activity in the alpha and beta range is thought to predominantly originate from infragranular cortical layers, whereas feedforward signals in the gamma range stem largely from supragranular layers. Distinct anatomical and spectral channels may therefore play specialized roles in communication within hierarchical cortical networks; however, empirical evidence for this organization in humans is limited. We leverage high precision MEG to test this proposal, directly and non-invasively, in human participants during visually guided actions. Visual alpha activity mapped onto deep cortical laminae, whereas visual gamma activity predominantly arose from superficial laminae. This laminar-specificity was echoed in sensorimotor beta and gamma activity. Visual gamma activity scaled with task demands in a way compatible with feedforward signaling. For sensorimotor activity, we observed a more complex relationship with feedback and feedforward processes. Distinct frequency channels thus operate in a laminar-specific manner, but with dissociable functional roles across sensory and motor cortices.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular simulations are typically performed in an aqueous environment where the number of ions remains fixed for the duration of the simulation, generally with either a minimally neutralizing ion environment or a number of salt pairs intended to match the macroscopic salt concentration. In contrast, real biomolecules experience local ion environments where the salt concentration is dynamic and may differ from bulk. The degree of salt concentration variability and average deviation from the macroscopic concentration remains, as yet, unknown. Here, we describe the theory and implementation of a Monte Carlo osmostat that can be added to explicit solvent molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations to sample from a semigrand canonical ensemble in which the number of salt pairs fluctuates dynamically during the simulation. The osmostat reproduce the correct equilibrium statistics for a simulation volume that can exchange ions with a large reservoir at a defined macroscopic salt concentration. To achieve useful Monte Carlo acceptance rates, the method makes use of nonequilibrium candidate Monte Carlo (NCMC) moves in which monovalent ions and water molecules are alchemically transmuted using short nonequilibrium trajectories, with a modified Metropolis-Hastings criterion ensuring correct equilibrium statistics for an ({Delta}{micro}, N, p, T) ensemble. We demonstrate how typical protein (DHFR and the tyrosine kinase Src) and nucleic acid (Drew-Dickerson B-DNA dodecamer) systems exhibit salt concentration distributions that significantly differ from fixed-salt bulk simulations and display fluctuations that are on the same order of magnitude as the average.",

We investigate how participant search for spatially correlated rewards in scenarios where one must avoid sampling rewards below a given threshold. This requires not only the balancing of exploration and exploitation, but also reasoning about how to avoid potentially risky areas of the search space. Within risky versions of the spatially correlated multi-armed bandit task, we show that participants behavior is aligned well with a Gaussian process function learning algorithm, which chooses points based on a safe optimization routine. Moreover, using leave-one-block-out cross-validation, we find that participants adapt their sampling behavior to the riskiness of the task, although the underlying function learning mechanism remains relatively unchanged. These results show that participants can adapt their search behavior to the adversity of the environment and enrich our understanding of adaptive behavior in the face of risk and uncertainty.",

These trajectories can further reveal hidden subcellular organization. We present here the statistical analysis of these trajectories based on the classical Langevin equation, which serves as a model of trajectories. Parametric and non-parametric estimators are constructed by discretizing the stochastic equations and they allow recovering tethering forces, diffusion tensor or membrane organization from measured trajectories, that differ from physical ones by a localization noise.

    "abstract": "KRAS and EGFR are known essential mediators of pancreatic cancer development. In addition, KRAS and EGFR have both been shown to interact with and perturb the function of Argonaute 2 (AGO2), a key regulator of RNA-mediated gene silencing. Here, we employed a genetically engineered mouse model of pancreatic cancer to define the effects of conditional loss of AGO2 in KRASG12D-driven pancreatic cancer. Genetic ablation of AGO2 does not interfere with development of the normal pancreas or KRASG12D-driven early precursor pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions. Remarkably, however, AGO2 is required for progression from early to late PanIN lesions, development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and metastasis. AGO2 ablation permits PanIN initiation driven by the EGFR-RAS axis, but rather than progressing to PDAC, these lesions undergo profound oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Loss of Trp53 (p53) in this model obviates the requirement of AGO2 for PDAC development. In mouse and human pancreatic tissues, increased expression of AGO2 and elevated co-localization with RAS at the plasma membrane is associated with PDAC progression. Furthermore, phosphorylation of AGO2Y393 by EGFR disrupts the interaction of wild-type RAS with AGO2 at the membrane, but does not affect the interaction of mutant KRAS with AGO2. ARS-1620, a G12C-specific inhibitor, disrupts the KRASG12C-AGO2 interaction specifically in pancreatic cancer cells harboring this mutant, demonstrating that the oncogenic KRAS-AGO2 interaction can be pharmacologically targeted. Taken together, our study supports a biphasic model of pancreatic cancer development: an AGO2-independent early phase of PanIN formation reliant on EGFR-RAS signaling, and an AGO2-dependent phase wherein the mutant KRAS-AGO2 interaction is critical to prevent OIS in PanINs and allow progression to PDAC.",

Here we investigated its prevalence in pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL), where SFs are not mutated. By comparing them to normal pro-B cells, we found thousands of aberrant local splice variations (LSVs) per sample, with 279 LSVs in 241 genes present in every comparison. These genes were enriched in RNA processing pathways and encoded ~100 SFs, e.g. hnRNPA1. hnRNPA1 3UTR was pervasively misspliced, yielding the transcript subject to nonsense-mediated decay. Thus, we knocked it down in B-lymphoblastoid cells, identified 213 hnRNPA1-dependent splicing events, and defined the hnRNPA1 splicing signature in pediatric leukemias. One of its elements was DICER1, a known tumor suppressor gene; its LSVs were consistent with reduced translation of DICER1 mRNA. Additionally, we searched for LSVs in other leukemia and lymphoma drivers and discovered 81 LSVs in 41 genes. 77 LSVs were confirmed using two large independent B-ALL RNA-seq datasets. In fact, the twenty most common B-ALL drivers showed higher prevalence of aberrant splicing than of somatic mutations. Thus, post-transcriptional deregulation of SF can drive widespread changes in B-ALL splicing and likely contribute to disease pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Solid tumours are less oxygenated than normal tissues. This is called tumour hypoxia and leads to resistance to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The molecular mechanisms underlying such resistance have been investigated in a range of tumour types, including the adult brain tumours glioblastoma, yet little is known for paediatric brain tumours. Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumour in children. Here we used a common MB cell line (D283-MED), to investigate the mechanisms of chemo and radio-resistance in MB, comparing to another MB cell line (MEB-Med8A) and to a widely used glioblastoma cell line (U87MG). In D283-MED and U87MG, chronic hypoxia (5 days), but not acute hypoxia (24 h) induced resistance to etoposide and X-ray irradiation. This acquired resistance upon chronic hypoxia was much less pronounced in MEB-Med8A cells. Using a transcriptomic approach in D283-MED cells, we found a large transcriptional remodelling upon long term hypoxia, in particular the expression of a number of genes involved in detection and repair of double strand breaks (DSB) was altered. The levels of Nibrin (NBN) and MRE11, members of the MRN complex (MRE11/Rad50/NBN) responsible for DSB recognition, were significantly down-regulated. This was associated with a reduction of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) activation by etoposide, indicating a profound dampening of the DNA damage signalling in hypoxic conditions. As a consequence, p53 activation by etoposide was reduced, and cell survival enhanced. Whilst U87MG shared the same dampened p53 activity, upon chemotherapeutic drug treatment in chronic hypoxic conditions, these cells used a different mechanism, independent of the DNA damage pathway. Together our results demonstrate a new mechanism explaining hypoxia-induced resistance involving the alteration of the response to DSB, but also highlight the cell type to cell type diversity and the necessity to take into account the differing tumour genetic make-up when considering re-sensitisation therapeutic protocols.",

We report the evolution of a microRNA cluster, mir-972C, that arose de novo and the subsequently rewired gene regulatory networks in Drosophila. Molecular evolution analyses revealed that mir-972C originated in the common ancestor of Drosophila where it comprises five old miRNAs. It subsequently recruited five new members in the melanogaster subgroup after conservative evolution for at least 50 million years. Population genetics analyses reveal that young and old mir-972C miRNAs evolved rapidly under positive selection in both seed and non-seed regions. Combining target prediction and cell transfection experiments, we find that sequence changes in individual mir-972C members resulted in extensive gene regulatory network divergence among D. melanogaster, D. simulans, and D. virilis, whereas the target pool of the cluster as a whole remains relatively conserved. Our results suggest that clustering of young and old miRNAs at the same locus broadens target repertoires, resulting in the gain of new targets without losing many old ones. This may facilitate the establishment of new miRNAs within existing regulatory networks.",

    "abstract": "New genes originated relatively recently and are only present in a subset of species in a phylogeny. Accumulated evidence suggests that new genes, like old genes that are conserved across species, can also take on important functions and be essential for the survival and reproductive success of organisms. While there are detailed analyses of the mechanisms underlying gained fertility functions by new genes, how new genes rapidly became essential for viability remains unclear. We focused on a young retro-duplicated gene (CG7804, which we named Cocoon) in Drosophila that originated three million years ago. We found that, unlike its evolutionarily conserved and broadly expressed parental gene, Cocoon has evolved rapidly under positive selection since its birth and accumulates many amino acid divergences at functional sites from the parental gene. Despite its young age, Cocoon is essential for the survival of D. melanogaster at multiple developmental stages, including the critical embryonic stage, and its expression is essential in different tissues from its parental gene. Functional genomic analyses found that Cocoon gained multiple DNA binding targets, which regulates the expression of genes that have other essential functions and/or have multiple gene-gene interactions. Our observations suggest that Cocoon acquired essential function to survival through forming interactions that have large impacts on the gene interaction network. Our study is an important step towards deciphering the evolutionary trajectory by which new genes functionally diverge from the parental gene and become essential.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the quantification of each genes expression distribution across cells, thus allowing the assessment of the dispersion, burstiness, and other aspects of its distribution beyond the mean. These statistical characterizations of the gene expression distribution are critical for understanding expression variation and for selecting marker genes for population heterogeneity. However, scRNA-seq data is noisy, with each cell typically sequenced at low coverage, thus making it difficult to infer properties of the gene expression distribution from raw counts. Based on a re-examination of 9 public data sets, we propose a simple technical noise model for scRNA-seq data with Unique Molecular Identifiers (UMI). We develop DESCEND, a method that deconvolves the true cross-cell gene expression distribution from observed scRNA-seq counts, leading to improved estimates of properties of the distribution such as dispersion and burstiness. DESCEND can adjust for cell-level covariates such as cell size, cell cycle and batch effects. DESCENDs noise model and estimation accuracy are further evaluated through comparisons to RNA FISH data, through data splitting and simulations, and through its effectiveness in removing known batch effects. We demonstrate how DESCEND can clarify and improve downstream analyses such as finding differentially bursty genes, identifying cell types, and selecting differentiation markers.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we review the performance of various hidden Markov model-based imputation methods in animal breeding populations. Traditionally, heuristic-based imputation methods have been used for imputation in large animal populations due to their computational efficiency, scalability, and accuracy. However, recent advances in the area of human genetics have increased the ability of probabilistic hidden Markov model methods to perform accurate phasing and imputation in large populations. These advances may enable these methods to be useful for routine use in large animal populations. To test this, we evaluate here the accuracy and computational cost of several methods in a series of simulated populations and a real animal population. We first tested single-step (diploid) imputation, which performs both phasing and imputation. Then we tested pre-phasing followed by haploid imputation. We tested four diploid imputation methods (fastPHASE, Beagle v4.0, IMPUTE2, and MaCH), three phasing methods, (SHAPEIT2, HAPI-UR, and Eagle2), and three haploid imputation methods (IMPUTE2, Beagle v4.1, and minimac3). We found that performing pre-phasing and haploid imputation was faster and more accurate than diploid imputation. In particular, we found that pre-phasing with Eagle2 or HAPI-UR and imputing with minimac3 or IMPUTE2 gave the highest accuracies in both simulated and real data.",

    "abstract": "It has long been observed that complex traits, including migraine, often aggregate in families, but the underlying genetic architecture behind this is not well understood. Two competing hypotheses exist, emphasizing either rare or common genetic variation. More specifically, familial aggregation could be predominantly explained by rare, penetrant variants that segregate according to Mendelian inheritance or rather by the sufficient polygenic accumulation of many common variants, each with an individually small effect. Some combination of both common and rare variation could also contribute towards a spectrum of disease risk.\\n\\nWe investigated this in a collection of 8,319 individuals across 1,589 migraine families from Finland. Family members were individually diagnosed by a migraine-specific questionnaire with either migraine without aura (MO, ICHD-3 code 1.1, n=2,357), migraine with typical aura (ICHD- 3 code 1.2.1, n=2,420), hemiplegic migraine (HM, ICHD-3 code 1.2.3, n=540), or no migraine (n=3,002). For comparison, we used population-based migraine cases (n=1,101) and controls (n=13,369) from the FINRISK study. The disease status of FINRISK individuals was assigned based on health registry data from outpatient clinics and/or prescription medication. All individuals were genotyped on the Illumina(R) CoreExome or PsychArray chip platforms and imputed to a Finnish reference panel of 6,962 haplotypes. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), representing the common variant burden in each individual, were calculated using weights from the most recent large-scale genome-wide association study of migraine. To account for family structure in our analyses, we used a mixed-model approach, adjusting for the genetic relationship matrix as a random effect.\\n\\nWe found a significantly higher common variant burden in familial cases of migraine (for all subtypes, measured by the odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation [SD] increase in PRS; OR = 1.76, 95% CI = 1.71-1.81, P = 1.7x10-109) compared to cases from a population cohort (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.25-1.38, P = 7.2x10-17) when using the population controls as a reference group. The highest enrichment was observed for HM (OR = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.86-2.07, P = 8.7x10-36) and migraine with typical aura (OR = 1.85, 95% CI = 1.79-1.91, P = 1.4x10-86) but enrichment was also present for MO (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.51-1.63, P = 1.1x10-48). Comparing within cases, there was no significant difference in common variant burden between the migraine with aura subtypes, HM and migraine with typical aura (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.99-1.19, P = 0.09), but both showed significantly higher enrichment compared to MO (OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.17-1.38, P = 7.3x10-7, and OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.11-1.23, P = 4.62x10-5, respectively). Additionally, we found that higher common variant burden corresponded to earlier age of headache onset (OR per SD increase in PRS for 3,631 cases with onset before 20 years old compared to 1,686 cases with onset later than 20 years old; OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.05-1.18, P = 8.3x10-4). FINRISK population cases identified from national health registry data were found to have lower common variant burden in comparison to the familial migraine cases (OR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.25-1.38, P = 6.8x10-17), unless the individuals had attended both a specialist clinic and also received prophylactic migraine treatment (OR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.53-1.88, P = 3.9x10-9). Finally, although rare variants have been suggested as the primary cause for familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM), we found only four out of 45 sequenced FHM families (8.9%) with a pathogenic mutation in one of the known risk genes.\\n\\nIn summary, our results demonstrate a substantial contribution of common polygenic variation to familial aggregation in migraine, comparable to both controls and that observed in migraine cases from a population cohort. The findings also suggest that individuals with migraine aura symptoms (either typical aura, which is mostly visual, or rare motor aura) tend to have higher common variant burden on average supporting the polygenic model also in these migraine subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Accurate decisions require knowledge of prior probabilities (e.g., prevalence or base rate) but it is unclear how prior probability is learned in the absence of a teacher. We hypothesized that humans could learn base rates from experience making decisions, even without feedback. Participants made difficult decisions about the direction of dynamic random dot motion. For each block of 15-42 trials, the base rate favored left or right by a different amount. Participants were not informed of the base rate, yet they gradually biased their choices and thereby increased accuracy and confidence in their decisions. They achieved this by updating knowledge of base rate after each decision, using a counterfactual representation of confidence that simulates a neutral prior. The strategy is consistent with Bayesian updating of belief and suggests that humans represent both true confidence, that incorporates the evolving belief of the prior, and counterfactual confidence that discounts the prior.",

During perception, visual activity is characterized by distinct processing stages, but the temporal dynamics underlying imagery remain unclear. Here, we investigated the dynamics of visual imagery in human participants using magnetoencephalography. We show that, contrary to perception, the onset of imagery is characterized by broad temporal generalization. Furthermore, there is consistent overlap between imagery and perceptual processing around 150 ms and from 300 ms after stimulus onset, presumably reflecting completion of the feedforward sweep and perceptual stabilization respectively. These results indicate that during imagery either the complete representation is activated at once and does not include low-level visual areas, or the order in which visual features are activated is less fixed and more flexible than during perception. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of visual imagery.",

    "abstract": "Random noise can enhance the detectability of weak signals in nonlinear threshold systems, a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance (SR). This concept is not only applicable to single threshold systems but can also be applied to dynamical systems with multiple attractor states, such as observed during the phenomenon of binocular rivalry. Binocular rivalry can be characterized by marginally stable attractor states between which the brain switches in a spontaneous, stochastic manner. The switches are thought to be driven by a combination of neuronal adaptation and noise. Here we used a computational model to predict the effect of noise on perceptual dominance durations when either low-contrast or high-contrast stimuli are presented. Subsequently we compared the model prediction to a series of three experiments where we measured binocular rivalry dynamics when noise (zero-mean Gaussian white noise) was added either to the visual stimulus (Exp. 1) or directly to the visual cortex (Exp. 2 and Exp. 3) by applying transcranial Random Noise Stimulation (tRNS 1mA, 100-640 Hz zero mean Gaussian white noise). We found that adding noise significantly reduced the mixed percept duration (Exp. 1 and Exp. 2). This effect was only present for low-contrast but not for high-contrast visual stimuli which is in line with the model predictions. Our results demonstrate that both central and peripheral noise can influence state-switching dynamics of binocular rivalry under specific conditions (e.g. low visual contrast stimuli), in line with a SR-mechanism.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIn middle age, declines in executive functioning (EF) are associated with decrements in the quality and/or quantity of white and grey matter. Recruitment of homologous regions has been identified as a compensatory mechanism for cognitive decline in later middle age, however research into neural substrates of EF has yet to be guided by dedifferentiation models. We hypothesized that frontal-parietal grey matter volume, interhemispheric white matter and intrahemispheric white matter fractional anisotropy (FA) will be predictive of EF. Further, we hypothesized that the comparative association between interhemispheric white matter and EF will increase with age, because of compensatory recruitment.\\n\\nMethodsNeurocognitive test data, DTI, and T1 MPRAGE scans (n = 444) were obtained from the NKI-Rockland Sample. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the relationship between age, EF, interhemispheric white matter (forceps minor; FM), intrahemispheric white matter (superior longitudinal fasciculus; SLF), and a frontal-parietal grey matter network. EF and grey matter were modelled as latent variables, with EF examined as the criterion. Additionally, a subsample of participants aged 55-85 (n = 168) was analyzed to examine the influence of age related compensatory mechanisms.\\n\\nResultsThere was a significant relationship between FM, grey matter, and EF, which was fully mediated by age. There was a significant relationship between SLF and EF, which was not mediated by age. For older adults, only the age-mediated pathway from FM to EF was significant.\\n\\nDiscussionUsing structural imaging data, support was found for age-related interhemispheric mechanisms of compensation, but not intrahemispheric mechanisms.\\n\\nKey points(1) Neural substrates of executive functioning are not static across the lifespan. (2) In older adults, white matter becomes more salient as a structural correlate of executive functioning, as recruitment needs increase.

These are P.s pv. morsprunorum race 1 (Psm R1), P.s pv. morsprunorum race 2 (Psm R2) and P.s pv. syringae (Pss). Psm R1 and R2 were originally designated as races of the same pathovar, however phylogenetic analysis has revealed them to be distantly related. This study characterised the pathogenicity of P. syringae on cherry and plum, in the field and the laboratory. The field experiment identified variation in host cultivar susceptibility to the different pathogen clades. The cherry cultivar Merton Glory exhibited a broad resistance to all clades, whilst cultivar Van showed race-specific resistance. Psm R1 may be divided into a race structure with some strains pathogenic to both cherry and plum and others only pathogenic to plum. The results of laboratory-based pathogenicity tests were compared to results obtained on whole-trees. Only cut shoot inoculations were found to be sensitive enough to detect cultivar variation in susceptibility. Measuring population growth of bacteria in detached leaves reliably discriminated pathogens from non-pathogens. In addition, symptom appearance discriminated Psm races from non-pathogens which triggered a rapid hypersensitive response (HR). The pathogen Pss rapidly induced disease lesions and therefore may exhibit a more necrotrophic lifestyle than hemi-biotrophic Psm races. This in-depth study of pathogenic interactions, identification of host resistance and optimisation of laboratory assays, will provide a framework for future genetic dissection of virulence and host resistance mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Biological self-organisation is a process of spontaneous pattern formation; namely the emergence of coherent and stable systemic configurations that distinguish themselves from their environment. This process can occur at various spatial scales: from the microscopic (giving rise to cells) to the macroscopic (the emergence of organisms). Self-organisation at each level is essential to account for the hierarchical organisation of living organisms (organelles within cells, within tissues, within organs, etc.). In this paper, we pursue the idea that Markov blankets - statistical boundaries separating states that are external to a system from its internal states - emerge at every possible level of the description of the (living) system. Through simulations, we show that the concept of a Markov blanket is fundamental in defining biological systems and underwrites the nature and form of interactions between successive levels of hierarchical structure. We demonstrate the validity of our argument using simulations, based on the normative principle of variational free energy minimisation. Specifically, we adopt a top-down approach to provide a proof of concept for the claim that the self-organisation of Markov blankets (and blankets of blankets) underwrites the self-evidencing, autopoietic behaviour of living systems.",

    "abstract": "The allosteric regulation of metabolic enzymes plays a key role in controlling the flux through metabolic pathways. The activity of such enzymes is traditionally described by allosteric rate laws in complex kinetic models of metabolic network function. As an alternative, we describe the fraction of the regulated enzyme that is in an active form by developing a detailed reaction network of all known ligand binding events to the enzyme. This fraction is the fundamental result of metabolic regulation as it represents the \\\"tug of war\\\" among the various regulators and substrates that determine the utilization of the enzyme. The active fraction corresponds to the utilization of the catalytic potential of the enzyme. Using well developed kinetic models of human red blood cell (RBC) glycolysis, we characterize the catalytic potential of its three key kinases: hexokinase (HEX), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and pyruvate kinase (PYK). We then compute their time-dependent interacting catalytic potentials. We show how detailed kinetic models of the management of the catalytic potential of the three kinases elucidates disturbance rejection capabilities of glycolysis. Further, we examine the sensitivity of the catalytic potential through an examination of existing personalized RBC models, providing a physiologically-meaningful sampling of the feasible parameter space. The graphical representation of the dynamic interactions of the individual kinase catalytic potential adjustment provides an easy way to understand how a robust homeostatic state is maintained through interacting allosteric regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Deep in vivo imaging of vasculature requires small, bright, and photostable fluorophores suitable for multiphoton microscopy (MPM). Although semiconducting polymer dots (pdots) are an emerging class of highly fluorescent contrast agents with favorable advantages for the next generation of in vivo imaging, their use for deep multiphoton imaging has never before been demonstrated. Here we characterize the multiphoton properties of three pdot variants (CNPPV, PFBT, and PFPV) and demonstrate deep imaging of cortical microvasculature in C57 mice. Specifically, we measure the two-versus three-photon power dependence of these pdots and observe a clear three-photon excitation signature at wavelengths longer than 1300 nm, and a transition from two-photon to three-photon excitation within a 1060 - 1300 nm excitation range. Furthermore, we show that pdots enable in vivo two-photon imaging of cerebrovascular architecture in mice up to 850 m beneath the pial surface using 800 nm excitation. In contrast with traditional multiphoton probes, we also demonstrate that the broad multiphoton absorption spectrum of pdots permits imaging at longer wavelengths ({lambda}ex = 1,060 and 1225 nm). These wavelengths approach an ideal biological imaging wavelength near 1,300 nm and confer compatibility with a high-power ytterbium-fiber laser and a high pulse energy optical parametric amplifier, resulting in substantial improvements in signal-to-background ratio (>3.5-fold) and greater cortical imaging depths of 900 m and 1300 m. Ultimately, pdots are a versatile tool for MPM due to their extraordinary brightness and broad absorption, which will undoubtedly unlock the ability to interrogate deep structures in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Genome assembly and annotation remains an exacting task. As the tools available for these tasks improve, it is useful to return to data produced with earlier instances to assess their credibility and correctness. The entomopathogenic nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora is widely used to control insect pests in horticulture. The genome sequence for this species was reported to encode an unusually high proportion of unique proteins and a paucity of secreted proteins compared to other related nematodes. We revisited the H. bacteriophora genome assembly and gene predictions to ask whether these unusual characteristics were biological or methodological in origin. We mapped an independent resequencing dataset to the genome and used the blobtools pipeline to identify potential contaminants. While present (0.2% of the genome span, 0.4% of predicted proteins), assembly contamination was not significant. Re-prediction of the gene set using BRAKER1 and published transcriptome data generated a predicted proteome that was very different from the published one. The new gene set had a much reduced complement of unique proteins, better completeness values that were in line with other related species genomes, and an increased number of proteins predicted to be secreted. It is thus likely that methodological issues drove the apparent uniqueness of the initial H. bacteriophora genome annotation and that similar contamination and misannotation issues affect other published genome assemblies.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe assay for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-seq) reveals the landscape and principles of DNA regulatory mechanisms by identifying the accessible genome of mammalian cells. When done at single-cell resolution, it provides an insight into the cell-to-cell variability that emerges from identical DNA sequences by identifying the variability in the genomic location of open chromatin sites in each of the cells. Processing of single-cell ATAC-seq requires a number of steps and a simple pipeline to processes and analyse single-cell ATAC-seq is not yet available.\\n\\nResultsThis paper presents ScAsAT (single-cell ATAC-seq analysis tool), a complete pipeline to process scATAC-seq data with simple steps. The pipeline is developed in a Jupyter notebook environment that holds the executable code along with the necessary description and results. For the initial sequence processing steps, the pipeline uses a number of well-known tools which it executes from a python environment for each of the fastq files. While functions for the data analysis part are mostly written in R, it is robust, flexible, interactive and easy to extend. The pipeline was applied to a single-cell ATAC-seq dataset in order to identify different cell-types from a complex cell mixture. The results from Scasat showed that open chromatin location corresponding to potential regulatory elements can account for cellular heterogeneity and can identify regulatory regions that separates cells from a complex population.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe jupyter notebook with the complete pipeline applied to the dataset published with this paper are publicly available on the Github (https://github.com/ManchesterBioinference/Scasat).

    "abstract": "Since the discovery of amylin its use has been discouraged by the inadequacy of the protocol involving multiple injections in addition to insulin. While a combined fixed-dose formulation is thus highly desirable, it has long been limited due to incompatibility as historically documented. We have investigated the compatibility of regular and fast-acting insulin analogues (Aspart, AspB28, and LisPro, LysB28ProB29) with the amylin analogue pramlintide. Insulin interacts with pramlintide, forming heterodimers as probed by electrospray ionization - ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry. While their interaction is likely to delay the amyloid aggregation of pramlintide in phosphate-buffered solution pH 7.0, they do not prevent aggregation at this condition. At acidic sodium acetate solution pH 5.0, combination of pramlintide and the fast-acting insulin analogues become stable against amyloid aggregation. The co-formulated product at high concentration of both pramlintide (600 g/mL,150 M) and LisPro insulin (50 IU/mL, 300 M) showed also stability against amyloid aggregation. These data indicate a potential for the development of a co-formulation of fast-acting LisPro insulin with pramlintide, which could bring benefits for the combined therapy.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The size distribution of discrete plant patches (PSD), a common descriptor of the spatial patterns of vascular vegetation, has been linked to variations in land degradation and ecosystem functioning in drylands. However, most studies on PSDs conducted to date have focused on a single or a few study sites within a particular region. Therefore, little is know on the general typology and distribution of PSDs at the global scale, and on the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors as drivers of their variation across geographical regions and habitat types. We analyzed 115 dryland plant communities from all continents except Antarctica to investigate the general typology of PSDs, and to assess the relative importance of biotic (plant cover, frequency of facilitation, soil amelioration, height of the dominant species) and abiotic (aridity and sand content) factors as drivers of PSDs across contrasting habitat types (shrublands and grasslands). We found that both power-law and lognormal PSDs were generally distributed regardless of the region of the world considered. The percentage of facilitated species in the community drives the emergence of power-law like spatial patterns in both shrublands and grasslands, although mediated by different mechanisms (soil and climatic amelioration, respectively). Other drivers of PSDs were habitat-specific: height of the dominant species and total cover were particularly strong drivers in shrublands and grasslands, respectively. The importance of biotic attributes as drivers of PSDs declined under the most arid conditions in both habitats. We observed that PSDs deviated from power law functions not only due to the loss of large, but also of small patches. Our results expand our knowledge about patch formation in drylands and the habitat-dependency of their drivers. They also highlight different ways in which facilitation may act on ecosystem functioning through the formation of plant spatial patterns.",

    "abstract": "Foraging parasitoids use chemical signals in host recognition and selection processes. Thereby, chemicals from the herbivore hosts play a crucial role. When different herbivores are present in the same plant or field, the perception of specific volatiles and contact compounds emitted from the host itself enable the parasitoids both to differentiate between hosts and non-hosts and to estimate the health status of its host. During the host feeding process, contact between the parasitoid and its host is very crucial, and oral secretions from the host play a key role during the first contact for such evaluation by the parasitoid. Using an integration of behavioral observations, biochemical and sensory physiological approaches we demonstrate that female parasitoids of Cotesia flavipes recognize their host and oviposit in reaction to an -amylase, which is present in the oral secretions of the larvae of their host, Chilo partellus. This activity was also mediated by a purified -amylase synthetized from Drosophila melanogaster. Using this synthetized enzyme, we further demonstrate that the conformation of the enzyme rather than its catalytic site is responsible for this activity. This enzyme is activating gustatory neurons of the terminal antennal sensilla chaetica of C. flavipes females. -amylases are therefore good candidates for an evolutionary solution to host selection in parasitoids, thus opening new avenues for investigations in hosts-parasitoids interactions.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the phenotypes underlying postzygotic reproductive isolation is crucial for fully understanding the evolution and maintenance of species. One potential postzygotic isolating barrier that has not yet been examined is learning and memory ability in hybrids. Learning and memory are important fitness-related traits, especially in scatter-hoarding species, where accurate retrieval of hoarded food is vital for winter survival. Here, we test the hypothesis that learning and memory ability can act as a postzygotic isolating barrier by comparing these traits among two scatter-hoarding songbird species, black-capped (Poecile atricapillus), Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis), and their naturally occurring hybrids. In an outdoor aviary setting, we find that hybrid chickadees perform significantly worse on an associative learning spatial task and are worse at solving a novel problem compared to both parental species. Deficiencies in learning and memory abilities could therefore contribute to postzygotic reproductive isolation between chickadee species. Given the importance of learning and memory for fitness, our results suggest that these traits may play an important, but as yet overlooked, role in postzygotic reproductive isolation.",

    "abstract": "In Mendelian randomization (MR), genetic variants are used to construct instrumental variables, which enable inference about the causal relationship between a phenotype of interest and a response or disease outcome. However, standard MR inference requires several assumptions, including the assumption that the genetic variants only influence the response through the phenotype of interest. Pleiotropy occurs when a genetic variant has an effect on more than one phenotype; therefore, a pleiotropic genetic variant may be an invalid instrumental variable. Hence, a naive method for constructing instrumental variables may lead to biased estimation of the causality between the phenotype and the response. Here, we present a set of intuitive methods (Constrained Instrumental Variable methods [CIV]) to construct valid instrumental variables and perform adjusted causal effect estimation when pleiotropy exists, focusing particularly on the situation where pleiotropic phenotypes have been measured. Our approach includes an automatic and valid selection of genetic variants when building the instrumental variables. We also provide details of the features of many existing methods, together with a comparison of their performance in a large series of simulations. CIV methods performed consistently better than many comparators across four different pleiotropic violations of the MR assumptions. We analyzed data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Mueller et al. (2005) to disentangle causal relationships of several biomarkers with AD progression. The results showed that CIV methods can provide causal effect estimates, as well as selection of valid instruments while accounting for pleiotropy.",

Previously we reported isolation of Pii gene from the rice cultivar Hitomebore (Takagi et al. 2013). To further understand rice components required for Pii-mediated resistance, we screened 5,600 mutant lines of Hitomebore cultivar and identified two mutants that lost Pii resistance without any changes in Pii gene sequence. Application of MutMap-Gap, the whole genome sequencing-based method of mutation identification, to the two mutants revealed that they have mutations in another NLR gene located close to Pii. The F1 plants derived from a cross of the two mutants showed pii phenotype, demonstrating that the newly identified NLR gene is indeed a component of Pii resistance.

We explore the effects of polygenic selection on introgression under the infinitesimal model with linkage. This model assumes that the introgressing block has an effectively infinite number of genes, each with an infinitesimal effect on the trait under selection. The block is assumed to introgress under directional selection within a native population that is genetically homogeneous. We use individual-based simulations and a branching process approximation to compute various statistics of the introgressing block, and explore how these depend on parameters such as the map length and initial trait value associated with the introgressing block, the genetic variability along the block, and the strength of selection. Our results show that the introgression dynamics of a block under infinitesimal selection is qualitatively different from the dynamics of neutral introgression. We also find that in the long run, surviving descendant blocks are likely to have intermediate lengths, and clarify how the length is shaped by the interplay between linkage and infinitesimal selection. Our results suggest that it may be difficult to distinguish introgression of single loci from that of genomic blocks with multiple, tightly linked and weakly selected loci.",

    "abstract": "Big data, accumulated from biomedical and agronomic studies, provides the potential to identify genes controlling complex human diseases and agriculturally important traits through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, big data also leads to extreme computational challenges, especially when sophisticated statistical models are employed to simultaneously reduce false positives and false negatives. The newly developed Fixed and random model Circulating Probability Unification (FarmCPU) method uses a bin method under the assumption that Quantitative Trait Nucleotides (QTNs) are evenly distributed throughout the genome. The estimated QTNs are used to separate a mixed linear model into a computationally efficient fixed effect model (FEM) and a computationally expensive random effect model (REM), which are then used iteratively. To completely eliminate the computationally expensive REM, we replaced REM with FEM by using Bayesian information criteria. To eliminate the requirement that QTNs be evenly distributed throughout the genome, we replaced the bin method with linkage disequilibrium information. The new method is called Bayesian-information and Linkage-disequilibrium Iteratively Nested Keyway (BLINK). Both real and simulated data analyses demonstrated that BLINK improves statistical power compared to FarmCPU, in addition to a remarkable improvement in computing time. Now, a dataset with half million markers and one million individuals can be analyzed within five hours, compared with one week using FarmCPU.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas syringae is a highly diverse bacterial species complex capable of causing a wide range of serious diseases on numerous agronomically important crop species. Here, we examine the evolutionary relationships of 391 agricultural and environmental strains from the P. syringae species complex using whole-genome sequencing and evolutionary genomic analyses. Our collection includes strains from 11 of the 13 previously described phylogroups isolated off of over 90 hosts. We describe the phylogenetic distribution of all orthologous gene families in the P. syringae pan-genome, reconstruct the phylogeny of P. syringae using a core genome alignment and a hierarchical clustering analysis of pan-genome content, predict ecologically and evolutionary relevant loci, and establish the forces of molecular evolution operating on each gene family. We find that the common ancestor of the species complex likely carried a Rhizobium-like type III secretion system (TTSS) and later acquired the canonical TTSS. The phylogenetic analysis also showed that the species complex is subdivided into primary and secondary phylogroups based on genetic diversity and rates of genetic exchange. The primary phylogroups, which largely consist of agricultural isolates, are no more divergent than a number of other bacterial species, while the secondary phylogroups, which largely consists of environmental isolates, have levels of diversity more in line with multiple distinct species within a genus. An analysis of rates of recombination within and between phylogroups revealed a higher rate of recombination within primary phylogroups than between primary and secondary phylogroups. We also found that \\\"ecologically significant\\\" virulence-associated loci and \\\"evolutionary significant\\\" loci under positive selection are over-represented among loci that undergo inter-phylogroup genetic exchange. These results indicate that while inter-phylogroup recombination occurs relatively rarely in the species complex, it is an important force of genetic cohesion, particularly among the strains in the primary phylogroups. This level of genetic cohesion and the shared plant-associated niche argues for considering the primary phylogroups as a true biological species.",

    "abstract": "Experimental studies of transcriptional regulation in bacteria require the ability to precisely measure changes in gene expression, often accomplished through the use of reporter genes. However, the boundaries of promoter sequences required for transcription are often unknown, thus complicating construction of reporters and genetic analysis of transcriptional regulation. Here, we analyze reporter libraries to define the promoter boundaries of the luxCDABE bioluminescence operon and the betIBA-proXWV osmotic stress operon in Vibrio harveyi. We describe a new method called RAIL (Rapid Arbitrary PCR Insertion Libraries) that combines the power of arbitrary PCR and isothermal DNA assembly to rapidly clone promoter fragments of various lengths upstream of reporter genes to generate large libraries. To demonstrate the versatility and efficiency of RAIL, we analyzed the promoters driving expression of the luxCDABE and betIBA-proXWV operons and created libraries of DNA fragments from these loci fused to fluorescent reporters. Using flow cytometry sorting and deep sequencing, we identified the DNA regions necessary and sufficient for maximum gene expression for each promoter. These analyses uncovered previously unknown regulatory sequences and validated known transcription factor binding sites. We applied this high-throughput method to gfp, mCherry, and lacZ reporters and multiple promoters in V. harveyi. We anticipate that the RAIL method will be easily applicable to other model systems for genetic, molecular, and cell biological applications.\\n\\nImportanceGene reporter constructs have long been essential tools for studying gene regulation in bacteria, particularly following the recent advent of fluorescent gene reporters. We developed a new method that enables efficient construction of promoter fusions to reporter genes to study gene regulation. We demonstrate the versatility of this technique in the model bacterium Vibrio harveyi by constructing promoter libraries for three bacterial promoters using three reporter genes. These libraries can be used to determine the DNA sequences required for gene expression, revealing regulatory elements in promoters. This method is applicable to various model systems and reporter genes for assaying gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Physical interaction of distal regulatory elements in three-dimensional space poses a significant challenge for studies of common disease, because noncoding risk variants may be substantial distances from the genes they regulate. Experimental methods to capture these interactions, such as chromosome conformation capture (CCC), usually cannot assign causal direction of effect between regulatory elements, an important component of disease fine-mapping. Here, we developed a statistical model that uses Mendelian Randomisation within a Bayesian hierarchical model framework, and applied it to a novel ATAC-seq data from 100 individuals mapping over 15,000 putatively causal interactions between distal regions of open chromatin. Strikingly, the majority (>60%) of interactions we detected were over distances of <20Kb, a range where CCC-based methods perform poorly. Because we can infer the direction of causal interactions, the model also significantly improves our ability to fine-map: when we applied it to an eQTL data set we reduced the number of variants in the 90% credible set size by half. We experimentally validate one of our associations using CRISPR engineering of the BLK/FAM167A locus, which is associated with risk for a range of autoimmune diseases and show that the causal variant is likely to be a non-coding insertion within a CTCF binding motif. Our study suggests that many regulatory variants will be challenging to map to their cognate genes using CCC-based techniques, but association genetics of chromatin state can provide a powerful complement to these approaches.",

    "abstract": "Flagella of the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii are nearly identical to cilia of mammalian cells and provide an excellent model to study ciliogenesis. These biflagellated cells have two actin genes: one encoding a conventional actin (IDA5) and the other encoding a divergent novel actin-like protein (NAP1). Previously, we described a role for actin in the regulation of flagella-building intraflagellar transport machinery. Here, we probe how actin redundancy contributes to this process using a nap1 mutant Chlamydomonas strain. Disruption of a single actin allows normal or slower incorporation but complete flagellar assembly. However, when we disrupt both actins using Latrunculin B (LatB) treatment on the nap1 mutant background, we find flagellar growth from newly synthesized limiting flagellar proteins is actin-dependent. Upon total actin disruption during flagellar assembly, transmission electron microscopy identified an accumulation of Golgi-adjacent vesicles, suggesting impaired vesicular trafficking may be the mechanism by which actin supports flagellar growth from new flagellar proteins. We also find there is a mislocalization of a key transition zone gating and ciliopathy protein, NPHP-4. Extended (2 hour) treatment with LatB, a condition under which NAP1 is upregulated, restores NPHP-4 localization. This suggests NAP1 can perform the functions of conventional actin at the transition zone. Our experiments demonstrate that each stage of flagellar biogenesis requires redundant actin function to varying degrees, with an absolute requirement for these actins in transport of Golgi-adjacent vesicles and flagellar incorporation of newly synthesized proteins.",

We performed a case-control analysis to identify drivers of immune activation and disease risk. Among 49 infants who developed TB disease over the first two years of life, and 129 matched controls who remained healthy, we found the cytomegalovirus (CMV) stimulated IFN-{gamma} response at age 4-6 months to be associated with CD8+ T-cell activation (Spearmans rho, p=6x10-8). A CMV specific IFN-{gamma} response was also associated with increased risk of developing TB disease (Conditional Logistic Regression, p=0.043, OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.02-4.83), and shorter time to TB diagnosis (Log Rank Mantel-Cox p=0.037). CMV positive infants who developed TB disease had lower expression of natural killer cell associated gene signatures and a lower frequency of CD3-CD4-CD8-lymphocytes. We identified transcriptional signatures predictive of risk of TB disease among CMV ELISpot positive (AUROC 0.98, accuracy 92.57%) and negative (AUROC 0.9, accuracy 79.3%) infants; the CMV negative signature validated in an independent infant study (AUROC 0.71, accuracy 63.9%).

We performed phylogenetic and coalescent analyses on sequences from five nuclear introns and a chloroplast locus to reconstruct their evolutionary history. We also estimated the genome size using flow cytometry, employing propidium iodide, and determined their sex using a sex-linked PCR marker.\\n\\nKEY RESULTSTwo well differentiated clades were resolved, discriminating two homogeneous groups: the widespread C. purpureus and a local group mostly restricted to the mountains in southern Spain. The latter also possessed a genome size 25% larger than the widespread C. purpureus, and the samples of this group consist entirely of females. We also found hybrids, and some of them had a genome size equivalent to the sum of the C. purpureus and Spanish genome, suggesting that they arose by allopolyploidy.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSThese data suggest that a new species of Ceratodon arose via peripatric speciation, potentially involving a genome size change and a strong female-biased sex ratio.

    "abstract": "A key step in insect olfaction is the transformation of a dense representation of odors in a small population of neurons - projection neurons (PNs) of the antennal lobe - into a sparse representation in a much larger population of neurons - Kenyon cells (KCs) of the mushroom body. What computational purpose does this transformation serve? We propose that the PN-KC network implements an online clustering algorithm which we derive from the k-means cost function. The vector of PN-KC synaptic weights converging onto a given KC represents the corresponding cluster centroid. KC activities represent attribution indices, i.e. the degree to which a given odor presentation is attributed to each cluster. Remarkably, such clustering view of the PN-KC circuit naturally accounts for several of its salient features. First, attribution indices are nonnegative thus rationalizing rectification in KCs. Second, the constraint on the total sum of attribution indices for each presentation is enforced by a Lagrange multiplier identified with the activity of a single inhibitory interneuron reciprocally connected with KCs. Third, the soft-clustering version of our algorithm reproduces observed sparsity and overcompleteness of the KC representation which may optimize supervised classification downstream.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveA putative relationship between markers for the serotonin system and the personality scale self-transcendence (ST) and its subscale spiritual acceptance (SA) has been demonstrated in a previous PET study of 5-HT1A receptor binding in healthy control subjects. The results could however not be replicated in a subsequent PET study at an independent centre. In this study, we performed a replication of our original study in a larger sample using Bayesian hypothesis testing to evaluate relative evidence both for and against this hypothesis.\\n\\nMethodsRegional 5-HT1A receptor binding potential (BPND) was examined in 50 healthy male subjects using PET with the radioligand [11C]WAY100635. 5-HT1A availability was calculated using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) yielding regional BPND. ST and SA were measured using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) questionnaire. Correlations between ST/SA scores and 5-HT1A BPND in frontal cortex, hippocampus and raphe nuclei were examined by calculation of default correlation Bayes factors (BFs) and replication BFs.\\n\\nResultsThere were no significant correlations between 5-HT1A receptor binding and ST/SA scores. Rather, five of six replication BFs provided moderate to strong evidence for no association between 5-HT1A availability and ST/SA, while the remaining BF provided only weak evidence.\\n\\nConclusionWe could not replicate our previous findings of an association between 5-HT1A availability and the personality trait ST/SA. Rather, the Bayesian analysis provided evidence for a lack of correlation. Further research should focus on whether other components of the serotonin system may be related to ST or SA. This study also illustrates how Bayesian hypothesis testing allows for greater flexibility and more informative conclusions than traditional p-values, suggesting that this approach may be advantageous for analysis of molecular imaging data.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition, maintenance and modulation of dendritic architecture are critical to neuronal form, plasticity and function. Morphologically, dendritic shape impacts functional connectivity and is largely mediated by organization and dynamics of cytoskeletal fibers that provide the underlying scaffold and tracks for intracellular trafficking. Identifying molecular factors that regulate dendritic cytoskeletal architecture is therefore important in understanding mechanistic links between cytoskeletal organization and neuronal function. In a neurogenomic-driven genetic screen of cytoskeletal regulatory molecules, we identified Formin3 (Form3) as a critical regulator of cytoskeletal architecture in Drosophila nociceptive sensory neurons. Form3 is a member of the conserved Formin family of multi-functional cytoskeletal regulators and time course analyses reveal Form3 is cell-autonomously required for maintenance of complex dendritic arbors. Cytoskeletal imaging demonstrates form3 mutants exhibit a specific destabilization of the dendritic microtubule (MT) cytoskeleton, together with defective dendritic trafficking of mitochondria, satellite Golgi and the TRPA channel Painless. Biochemical studies reveal Form3 directly interacts with MTs via FH1-FH2 domains and promotes MT stabilization via acetylation. Neurologically, mutations in human Inverted Formin 2 (INF2; ortholog of form3) have been causally linked to Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease. CMT sensory neuropathies lead to impaired peripheral sensitivity. Defects in form3 function in nociceptive neurons results in a severe impairment in noxious heat evoked behaviors. Expression of the INF2 FH1-FH2 domains rescues form3 defects in MT stabilization and nocifensive behavior revealing conserved functions in regulating the cytoskeleton and sensory behavior thereby providing novel mechanistic insights into potential etiologies of CMT sensory neuropathies.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMechanisms governing cytoskeletal architecture are critical in regulating neural function as aberrations are linked to a broad spectrum of neurological and neurocognitive disorders. Formins are important cytoskeletal regulators however their mechanistic roles in neuronal architecture are poorly understood. We demonstrate mutations in Drosophila formin3 lead to progressive destabilization of the dendritic microtubule cytoskeleton resulting in severely reduced arborization coupled to impaired organelle and ion channel trafficking, as well as nociceptive sensitivity. INF2 mutations are implicated in CMT sensory neuropathies, and INF2 expression can rescue microtubule and nociceptive behavioral defects in form3 mutants. While CMT sensory neuropathies have been linked to defects in axonal development and myelination, our studies connect dendritic cytoskeletal defects with peripheral insensitivity suggesting possible alternative etiological bases.",

    "abstract": "Using robots to automate laboratory tasks could increase throughput and reproducibility, but requires experimental protocols to be specified in a computer-readable format. We present a new user interface (Lists of Liquids) for specifying experimental protocols by directly manipulating a diagram: rather than having to specify individual liquid handling operations, the user can simply specify that particular lists of liquids should be combined as either a Cartesian product or convolution, and the system will plan a series of liquid handling steps to achieve this. This is intended to provide a higher-level interface in order to make the creation of protocols faster and less error prone.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn many countries tuberculosis incidence is low and largely shaped by immigrant populations from high-burden countries. This is the case in Norway, where more than 80 per cent of TB cases are found among immigrants from high-incidence countries. A variable latent period, low rates of evolution and structured social networks make separating import from within-border transmission a major conundrum to TB-control efforts in many low-incidence countries.\\n\\nMethodsClinical Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates belonging to an unusually large genotype cluster associated with people born in the Horn of Africa, have been identified in Norway over the last two decades. We applied modeled transmission based on whole-genome sequence data to estimate infection times for individual patients. By contrasting these estimates with time of arrival in Norway, we estimate on a case-by-case basis whether patients were likely to have been infected before or after arrival.\\n\\nResultsIndependent import was responsible for the majority of cases, but we estimate that about a quarter of the patients had contracted TB in Norway.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study illuminates the transmission dynamics within an immigrant community. Our approach is broadly applicable to many settings where TB control programs can benefit from understanding when and where patients acquired tuberculosis.",

    "abstract": "Herein we extend the work from Patel et al. (1) to find the approximate, optimal distribution of vaccinations of a virus spreading on a network with the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs). We situate our investigation in an online social network, a Facebook graph of ~4000 nodes. Within this framework we investigate the performance of an optimized vaccine distribution scheme against that of a well known heuristic scheme: the vaccination of highly ranked nodes. We include also a baseline scheme of vaccinating random nodes. We show the algorithm is superior to rank scheme in low vaccine coverages, and performs comparably for most other coverage values, lending support to the optimality of this heuristic measure.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is one of the most common mental illnesses and a leading cause of disability worldwide. Electronic Health Records (EHR) allow researchers to conduct unprecedented large-scale observational studies investigating MDD, its disease development and its interaction with other health outcomes. While there exist methods to classify patients as clear cases or controls, given specific data requirements, there are presently no simple, generalizable, and validated methods to classify an entire patient population into varying groups of depression likelihood and severity.\n\nMethodsWe have tested a simple, pragmatic electronic phenotype algorithm that classifies patients into one of five mutually exclusive, ordinal groups, varying in depression phenotype. Using data from an integrated health system on 278,026 patients from a 10-year study period we have tested the convergent validity of these constructs using measures of external validation, including patterns of psychiatric prescriptions, symptom severity, indicators of suicidality, comorbidity, mortality, health care utilization, and polygenic risk scores for MDD.\n\nResultsWe found consistent patterns of increasing morbidity and/or adverse outcomes across the five groups, providing evidence for convergent validity.\n\nLimitationsThe study population is from a single rural integrated health system which is predominantly white, possibly limiting its generalizability.\n\nConclusionOur study provides initial evidence that a simple algorithm, generalizable to most EHR data sets, provides categories with meaningful face and convergent validity that can be used for stratification of an entire patient population.",
