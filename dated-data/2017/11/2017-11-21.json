    "abstract": "Tumors consist of a hierarchical population of cells that differ in their phenotype and genotype. This hierarchical organization of cells means that a few clones (i.e., cells and several generations of offspring) are abundant while most are rare, which is called clonal dominance. Such dominance also occurred in published in vitro iterated growth and passage experiments with tumor cells in which genetic barcodes were used for lineage tracing. A potential source for such heterogeneity is that dominant clones derive from cancer stem cells with an unlimited self-renewal capacity. Furthermore, ongoing evolution within the growing population may also induce clonal dominance. To understand how clonal dominance developed in the iterated growth and passage experiments, we built a computational model that accurately simulates these experiments. The model simulations reproduced the clonal dominance that developed in in vitro iterated growth and passage experiments when the division rates vary between cells, due to a combination of initial variation and of ongoing mutational processes. In contrast, the experimental results can neither be reproduced with a model that considers random growth and passage, nor with a model based on cancer stem cells. Altogether, our model suggests that in vitro clonal dominance develops due to selection of fast-dividing clones.",

    "abstract": "An estimated 17% of cancers worldwide are associated with infectious causes. The extent and biological significance of viral presence/infection in actual tumor samples is generally unknown but could be measured using human transcriptome (RNA-seq) data from tumor samples.\\n\\nWe present an open source bioinformatics pipeline viGEN, which combines existing well-known and novel RNA-seq tools for not only the detection and quantification of viral RNA, but also variants in the viral transcripts.\\n\\nThe pipeline includes 4 major modules: The first module allows to align and filter out human RNA sequences; the second module maps and count (remaining un-aligned) reads against reference genomes of all known and sequenced human viruses; the third module quantifies read counts at the individual viral genes level thus allowing for downstream differential expression analysis of viral genes between experimental and controls groups. The fourth module calls variants in these viruses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no publicly available pipelines or packages that would provide this type of complete analysis in one open source package.\\n\\nIn this paper, we applied the viGEN pipeline to two case studies. We first demonstrate the working of our pipeline on a large public dataset, the TCGA cervical cancer cohort. We also performed additional in-depth analyses on a small focused study of TCGA liver cancer patients. In this cohort, we perform viral-gene quantification, viral-variant extraction and survival analysis. This allowed us to find differentially expressed viral-transcripts and viral-variants between the groups of patients, and connect them to clinical outcome.\\n\\nFrom our analyses, we show that we were able to successfully detect the human papilloma virus among the TCGA cervical cancer patients. We compared the viGEN pipeline with two metagenomics tools and demonstrate similar sensitivity/specificity. We were also able to quantify viral-transcripts and extract viral-variants using the liver cancer dataset. The results presented corresponded with published literature in terms of rate of detection, viral gene expression patterns and impact of several known variants of HBV genome. Results also show novel information about distinct patterns of expression and co-expression in Hepatitis B and the Human Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV) K113 viruses.\\n\\nThis pipeline is generalizable, and can be used to provide novel biological insights into the significance of viral and other microbial infections in complex diseases, tumorigeneses and cancer immunology.

    "abstract": "Every day we make choices under uncertainty; choosing what route to work or which queue in a supermarket to take, for example. It is unclear how outcome variance, e.g. uncertainty about waiting time in a queue, affects decisions and confidence when outcome is stochastic and continuous. How does one evaluate and choose between an option with unreliable but high expected reward, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward? Here we used an experimental design where two choices payoffs took continuous values, to examine the effect of outcome variance on decision and confidence. We found that our participants probability of choosing the good (high expected reward) option decreased when the good or the bad options payoffs were more variable. Their confidence ratings were affected by outcome variability, but only when choosing the good option. Unlike perceptual detection tasks, confidence ratings correlated only weakly with decisions time, but correlated with the consistency of trial-by-trial choices. Inspired by the satisficing heuristic, we propose a \\\"stochastic satisficing\\\" (SSAT) model for evaluating options with continuous uncertain outcomes. In this model, options are evaluated by their probability of exceeding an acceptability threshold, and confidence reports scale with the chosen options thus-defined satisficing probability. Participants decisions were best explained by an expected reward model, while the SSAT model provided the best prediction of decision confidence. We further tested and verified the predictions of this model in a second experiment. Our model and experimental results generalize the models of metacognition from perceptual detection tasks to continuous-value based decisions. Finally, we discuss how the stochastic satisficing account of decision confidence serves psychological and social purposes associated with the evaluation, communication and justification of decision-making.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryEvery day we make several choices under uncertainty, like choosing a queue in a supermarket. However, the computational mechanisms underlying such decisions remain unknown. For example, how does one choose between an option with unreliable high expected reward, like the volatile express queue, and an option with more certain but lower expected reward in the standard queue? Inspired by bounded rationality and the notion of  satisficing, i.e. settling for a good enough option, we propose that such decisions are made by comparing the likelihood of different actions to surpass an acceptability threshold. When facing uncertain decisions, our participants confidence ratings were not consistent with the expected outcomes rewards, but instead followed the satisficing heuristic proposed here. Using an acceptability threshold may be especially useful when evaluating and justifying decisions under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Reproduction is a defining feature of living systems. To reproduce, aggregates of biological units (e.g., multicellular organisms or colonial bacteria) must fragment into smaller parts. Fragmentation modes in nature range from binary fission in bacteria to collective-level fragmentation and the production of unicellular propagules in multicellular organisms. Despite this apparent ubiquity, the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes has received little attention. Here, we develop a model in which groups arise from the division of single cells that do not separate but stay together until the moment of group fragmentation. We allow for all possible fragmentation patterns and calculate the population growth rate of each associated life cycle. Fragmentation modes that maximise growth rate comprise a restrictive set of patterns that include production of unicellular propagules and division into two similar size groups. Life cycles marked by single-cell bottlenecks maximise population growth rate under a wide range of conditions. This surprising result offers a new evolutionary explanation for the widespread occurrence of this mode of reproduction. All in all, our model provides a framework for exploring the adaptive significance of fragmentation modes and their associated life cycles.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMode of reproduction is a defining trait of all organisms, including colonial bacteria and multicellular organisms. To produce offspring, aggregates must fragment by splitting into two or more groups. The particular way that a given group fragments defines the life cycle of the organism. For instance, insect colonies can reproduce by splitting or by producing individuals that found new colonies. Similarly, some colonial bacteria propagate by fission or by releasing single cells, while others split in highly sophisticated ways; in multicellular organisms reproduction typically proceeds via a single cell bottleneck phase. The space of possibilities for fragmentation is so vast that an exhaustive analysis seems daunting. Focusing on fragmentation modes of a simple kind we parametrise all possible modes of group fragmentation and identify those modes leading to the fastest population growth rate. Two kinds of life cycle dominate: one involving division into two equal size groups, and the other involving production of a unicellular propagule. The prevalence of these life cycles in nature is consistent with our null model and suggests that benefits accruing from population growth rate alone may have shaped the evolution of fragmentation mode.",

The U1 snRNP, which binds to 5 splice sites, plays an essential role in early steps of the splicing reaction. Here, we show that Arabidopsis LUC7 proteins, which are encoded by a three-member gene family in Arabidopsis, are important for plant development and stress resistance. We show that LUC7 are U1 snRNP accessory proteins by RNA immunoprecipitation experiments and LUC7 protein complex purifications. Transcriptome analyses revealed that LUC7 proteins are not only important for constitutive splicing, but also affects hundreds of alternative splicing events. Interestingly, LUC7 proteins specifically promote splicing of a subset of terminal introns. Splicing of LUC7-dependent introns is a prerequisite for nuclear export and some splicing events are modulated by stress in a LUC7-dependent manner. Taken together our results highlight the importance of the U1 snRNP component LUC7 in splicing regulation and suggest a previously unrecognized role of a U1 snRNP accessory factor in terminal intron splicing.",

Because we cannot track the oscillatory activity of the brain from extinct hominins, we used our current understanding of the language oscillogenome (that is, the set of genes responsible for basic aspects of the oscillatory activity relevant for language) to infer some properties of the Neanderthal oscillome. We have found that several candidates for the language oscillogenome show differences in their methylation patterns between Neanderthals and humans.

    "abstract": "In bacteria, the canonical mechanism of translational repression by small RNAs (sRNAs) involves sRNA-mRNA base pairing that occludes the ribosome binding site (RBS), directly preventing translation. In this mechanism, the sRNA is the direct regulator, while the RNA chaperone Hfq plays a supporting role by stabilizing the sRNA. There are a few examples where the sRNA does not directly interfere with ribosome binding, yet translation of the target mRNA is still inhibited. Mechanistically, this non-canonical regulation by sRNAs is poorly understood. Our previous work demonstrated repression of the mannose transporter manX mRNA by the sRNA SgrS, but the regulatory mechanism was unknown. Here, we report that manX translation is controlled by a molecular role-reversal mechanism where Hfq, not the sRNA, is the direct repressor. Hfq binding adjacent to the manX RBS is required for sRNA-mediated translational repression. Translation of manX is also regulated by another sRNA, DicF, via the same non-canonical Hfq-dependent mechanism. Our results suggest that the sRNAs recruit Hfq to its binding site or stabilize the mRNA-Hfq complex. This work adds to the growing number of examples of diverse mechanisms of translational regulation by sRNAs in bacteria.",

Here we study the dynamics of cardiac differentiation and morphogenesis by tracking individual cells in live analysis of mouse embryos. We report that during an initial phase, FHF precursors differentiate rapidly to form a cardiac crescent, while limited morphogenesis takes place. In a second phase, no differentiation occurs while extensive morphogenesis, including splanchnic mesoderm sliding over the endoderm, results in HT formation. In a third phase, cardiac precursor differentiation resumes and contributes to SHF-derived regions and the dorsal closure of the HT. These results reveal tissue-level coordination between morphogenesis and differentiation during HT formation and provide a new framework to understand heart development.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are accompanied by a diverse array of viruses. Through infections of abundant microbes, these viruses have the potential to mediate competition within the community, effectively weakening competitive interactions and promoting coexistence. This is of particular relevance for host-associated microbial communities, since the diversity of the microbiota has been linked to host health and functioning. Here, we study the interaction between two key members of the microbiota of the freshwater metazoan Hydra vulgaris. The two commensal bacteria Curvibacter sp. and Duganella sp. protect their host from fungal infections, but only if both of them are present. Coexistence of the two bacteria is thus beneficial for Hydra. Intriguingly, Duganella sp. appears to be the superior competitor in vitro due to its higher growth rate when both bacteria are grown seperately, but in coculture the outcome of competition depends on the relative initial abundances of the two species. The presence of an inducible prophage in the Curvibacter sp. genome which is able to lytically infect Duganella sp., led us to hypothesise that the phage modulates the interaction between these two key members of the Hydra microbiota. Using a mathematical model we show that the interplay of the lysogenic life-cycle of the Curvibacter phage and the lytic life-cycle on Duganella sp. can explain the observed complex competitive interaction between the two bacteria. Our results highlight the importance of taking lysogeny into account for understanding microbe-virus interactions and show the complex role phages can play in promoting coexistence of their bacterial hosts.",

    "abstract": "Abstract]For many years, curve fitting software has been heavily utilized to fit simple models to various types of biophysical data. Although such software packages are easy to use for simple functions, they are often expensive and present substantial impediments to applying more complex models or for the analysis of large datasets. One field that is relient on such data analysis is the thermodynamics and kinetics of protein folding. Over the past decade, increasingly sophisticated analytical models have been generated, but without simple tools to enable routine analysis. Consequently, users have needed to generate their own tools or otherwise find willing collaborators. Here we present PyFolding, a free, open source, and extensible Python framework for graphing, analysis and simulation of the biophysical properties of proteins. To demonstrate the utility of PyFolding, we have used it to analyze and model experimental protein folding and thermodynamic data. Examples include: (i) multi-phase kinetic folding fitted to linked equations, (ii) global fitting of multiple datasets and (iii) analysis of repeat protein thermodynamics with Ising model variants. Moreover, we demonstrate how Pyfolding is easily extensible to novel functionality beyond applications in protein folding via the addition of new models. Example scripts to perform these and other operations are supplied with the software, and we encourage users to contribute notebooks and models to create a community resource. Finally, we show that PyFolding can be used in conjunction with Jupyter notebooks as an easy way to share methods and analysis for publication and amongst research teams.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mental disorder characterized by alternating periods of depression and mania. Individuals with BD have higher levels of early mortality than the general population, and a substantial proportion of this may be due to increased risk for comorbid diseases. Recent evidence suggests that pleiotropy, either in the form of a single risk-allele or the combination of multiple loci genome-wide, may underlie medical comorbidity between traits and diseases. To identify the molecular events that underlie BD and related medical comorbidities, we generated imputed whole genome sequence (WGS) data using a population specific reference panel, for an extended multigenerational Old Order Amish pedigree (400 family members) segregating BD and related disorders. First, we investigated all putative disease-causing variants at known Mendelian disease loci present in this pedigree. Second, we performed genomic profiling using polygenic risk scores to establish each individual's risk for several complex diseases. To explore the contribution of disease genes to BD we performed gene-based and variant-based association tests for BD, and found that Mendelian disease genes are enriched in the top results from both tests (OR=20.3, p=1x10-3; OR=2.2, p=1x10-2). We next identified a set of Mendelian variants that co-occur in individuals with BD more frequently than their unaffected family members, including the R3527Q mutation in APOB associated with hypercholesterolemia. Using polygenic risk scores, we demonstrated that BD individuals from this pedigree were enriched for the same common risk-alleles for BD as in the general population ({beta}=0.416, p=6x10-4). Furthermore, in the extended Amish family we find evidence for a common genetic etiology between BD and clinical autoimmune thyroid disease (p=1x10-4), diabetes (p=1x10-3), and lipid traits such as triglyceride levels (p=3x10-4). We identify genomic regions that contribute to the differences between BD individuals and unaffected family members by calculating local genetic risk for independent LD blocks. Our findings provide evidence for the extensive genetic pleiotropy that can drive epidemiological findings of comorbidities between diseases and other complex traits. Identifying such patterns may enable the subtyping of complex diseases and facilitate our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying phenotypic heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors are characterized by their domain architecture, including DNA binding and protein-protein interaction domain combinations, which regulate their binding specificity, as well as their ability to effect a change on gene expression of their downstream targets. Transcription factors are central to organismal development, thus they potentially are instrumental in producing phenotypic diversity. Transcription factor abundance was estimated via 49 major DNA binding domain families, as well as 34 protein-protein interaction domain families, in 48 bird genomes, which were then compared with 6 available reptile genomes, in an effort to assess the degree to which these domains are potentially connected to increased phenotypic diversity in the avian lineage. We hypothesized that there would be increased abundance in multiple transcription factor domain families, as well as domains associated with protein-protein interactions, that would correlate with the increased phenotypic diversity found in birds; instead, this data shows a general loss/contraction of major domain families, with the largest losses in domain families associated with multiple developmental (feather, body-plan, immune) and metabolic processes. Ultimately, the results of this analyses represent a general characterization of domain family composition in birds, thus the specific domain composition of TF families should be probed further, especially those with the largest reductions seen in this study.",

    "abstract": "Among the factors that may reduce the predictability of evolution, chaos, characterized by a strong dependence on initial conditions, has received much less attention than randomness due to genetic drift or environmental stochasticity. It was recently shown that chaos in phenotypic evolution arises commonly under frequency-dependent selection caused by competitive interactions mediated by many traits. This result has been used to argue that chaos should often make evolutionary dynamics unpredictable. However, populations also evolve largely in response to external changing environments, and such environmental forcing is likely to influence the outcome of evolution in systems prone to chaos. We investigate how a changing environment causing oscillations of an optimal phenotype interacts with the internal dynamics of an eco-evolutionary system that would be chaotic in a constant environment. We show that strong environmental forcing can improve the predictability of evolution, by reducing the probability of chaos arising, and by dampening the magnitude of chaotic oscillations. In contrast, weak forcing can increase the probability of chaos, but it also causes evolutionary trajectories to track the environment more closely. Overall, our results indicate that, although chaos may occur in evolution, it does not necessarily undermine its predictability.",

We apply our approach to neural recordings of mice moving freely in a box, where we find a circular feature. We then observe that the decoded value corresponds well to the head direction of the mouse. Thus we capture head direction cells and decode the head direction from the neural population activity without having to process the behaviour of the mouse. Interestingly, the decoded values convey more information about the neural activity than the tracked head direction does, with differences that have some spatial organization. Finally, we note that the residual population activity, after the head direction has been accounted for, retains some low-dimensional structure but with no discernible shape.",

However, a cross comparison of these longevity pathways using a multi-omics integration approach is lacking. In this study, we aimed to identify key pathways and metabolite fingerprints of longevity that are shared between IIS and CR worm models using a multi-omics integration approach. We generated transcriptomics and metabolomics data from two long-lived mutant worm strains, i.e. daf-2 (impaired IIS pathway) and eat-2 (CR model) and compared them with the N2 strain. Transcriptional profiling identified shared longevity signatures between the two strains, such as an upregulation of lipid storage and defense responses and downregulation of macromolecule synthesis and developmental processes. The shared longevity signatures revealed by metabolomics profiling included an increase in the levels of glycerol-3P, ademine, xanthine, and AMP, and a decrease in the levels of the amino acid pool, the C18:0 and C17:1 fatty acids. After we integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics data based on the annotations in KEGG, our results highlighted a downregulation of pyrimidine metabolism and upregulation of purine metabolism as a commonality between the two longevity mechanisms. Overall, our findings point towards the existence of shared metabolic pathways that are likely important for lifespan extension and provide novel insights into potential regulators and metabolic fingerprints for longevity.",

    "abstract": "Cellular identity relies on cell type-specific gene expression profiles controlled by cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoters, enhancers and anchors of chromatin interactions. CREs are unevenly distributed across the genome, giving rise to distinct subsets such as individual CREs and Clusters Of cis-Regulatory Elements (COREs), also known as super-enhancers. Identifying COREs is a challenge due to technical and biological features that entail variability in the distribution of distances between CREs within a given dataset. To address this issue, we developed a new unsupervised machine learning approach termed Clustering of genomic REgions Analysis Method (CREAM) that outperforms the Ranking Of Super Enhancer (ROSE) approach. Specifically CREAM identified COREs are enriched in CREs strongly bound by master transcription factors according to ChIP-seq signal intensity, are proximal to highly expressed genes, are preferentially found near genes essential for cell growth and are more predictive of cell identity. Moreover, we show that CREAM enables subtyping primary prostate tumor samples according to their CORE distribution across the genome. We further show that COREs are enriched compared to individual CREs at TAD boundaries and these are preferentially bound by CTCF and factors of the cohesin complex (e.g.: RAD21 and SMC3). Finally, using CREAM against transcription factor ChIP-seq reveals CTCF and cohesin-specific COREs preferentially at TAD boundaries compared to intra-TADs. CREAM is available as an open source R package (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CREAM) to identify COREs from cis-regulatory annotation datasets from any biological samples.",

We use for this purpose the panel of 60 human cell lines (NCI-60) provided by the National Cancer Institute. Our study suggests that utilization of mathematical tools for network-based analysis can provide novel insights into drug response and cancer biology. We adopted a discrete notion of Ricci curvature to measure the robustness of biological networks constructed with a pre-treatment gene expression dataset and coupled the results with the GI50 response of the cell lines to the drugs. The link between network robustness and Ricci curvature was implemented using the theory of optimal mass transport. Our hypothesis behind this idea is that robustness in the biological network contributes to tumor drug resistance, thereby enabling us to predict the effectiveness and sensitivity of drugs in the cell lines. Based on the resulting drug response ranking, we assessed the impact of genes that are likely associated with individual drug response. For important genes identified, we performed a gene ontology enrichment analysis using a curated bioinformatics database which resulted in very plausible biological processes associated with drug response across cell lines and cell types from the biological and literature viewpoint. These results demonstrate the potential of using the mathematical network analysis in assessing drug response and in identifying relevant genomic biomarkers and biological processes for precision medicine.",

We have now further defined the biochemical events responsible for the toxic effects of signaling through the RAS pathway. By combining pharmacological and genetic approaches, we have developed multiple lines of evidence that signaling through extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) mediates the toxicity. These findings imply that tumors with mutant oncogenes that drive signaling through the RAS pathway must restrain the activity of ERK1/2 to avoid cell toxicities and enable tumor growth. In particular, a dual specificity phosphatase, DUSP6, regulates phosphorylated (P)-ERK levels in lung adenocarcinoma cells, providing negative feedback to the RAS signaling pathway. Accordingly, inhibition of DUSP6 is cytotoxic in LUAD cells driven by either mutant KRAS or mutant EGFR, phenocopying the effects of co-expression of mutant KRAS and EGFR. Together, these data suggest that targeting DUSP6 or other feedback regulators of the EGFR-KRAS-ERK pathway may offer a strategy for treating certain cancers by exceeding an upper threshold of RAS-mediated signaling.",

The results show that RNA noise is amplified in the cytoplasm compared to the nucleus in ~85% of genes across diverse promoters, genomic loci, and cell types (human and mouse). Surprisingly, measurements show further amplification of RNA noise in the cytoplasm, fitting a model of biphasic mRNA conversion between translation- and degradation-competent states. The multi-state translation-degradation of mRNA also causes substantial noise amplification in protein levels, ultimately accounting for ~74% of intrinsic protein variability in cell populations. Overall, the results demonstrate how transcriptional bursts are intrinsically amplified by mRNA processing and indicate mechanisms through which noise could act as a substrate for evolutionary selection.",

We also present HARP: a new computational tool for sorting SNPs in phased genomes to efficiently measure allele-specific genome-wide data. Analysis of 6 different hybrid mESC clones with different genomes (C57BL/6, 129/sv and CAST/Ei), parental configurations and gender revealed significant RT asynchrony between alleles across ~12 % of the autosomal genome linked to sub-species genomes but not to parental origin, growth conditions or gender. RT asynchrony in mESCs strongly correlated with changes in Hi-C compartments between alleles but not SNP density, gene expression, imprinting or chromatin accessibility. We then tracked mESC RT asynchronous regions during development by analyzing differentiated cell types including extraembryonic endoderm stem (XEN) cells, 4 male and female primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and neural precursors (NPCs) differentiated in vitro from mESCs with opposite parental configurations. Surprisingly, we found that RT asynchrony and allelic discordance in Hi-C compartments seen in mESCs was largely lost in all differentiated cell types, coordinated with a more uniform Hi-C compartment arrangement, suggesting that genome organization of homologues converges to similar folding patterns during cell fate commitment.",

However, it has remained unclear to what extent miRNAs act redundantly when they are members of the same family and thus share a common seed. Using in vivo studies in C. elegans, we uncover features that drive specific target repression by individual miRNA family members. We find that seed-distal complementarity to a specific family member promotes specificity. However, the extent and robustness of specificity are greatly increased by seed match  imperfections, such as bulges and G:U wobble base pairs. Depending on the seed match architecture, specificity may be overcome by increasing the levels of a miRNA lacking seed-distal complementarity. Hence, in contrast to a binary distinction between functional and non-functional target sites, our data support a model where functionality depends on a combination of target site quality and miRNA abundance. This emphasizes the importance of studying miRNAs under physiological conditions in their endogenous contexts.",

The efficacy of three CFTR-modulating treatments is investigated: ivacaftor (VX-770) with lumacaftor (VX-809), VX-809 alone and Thymosin alpha 1 (T1) alone. All three treatments restore coordination of cilia beating in the CF cells, albeit to varying degrees. We argue cilia are affected by these treatments through the physical properties of the mucus. Phenotyping cilia dynamics through multi-DDM provides novel insight into the response of ciliary beating following treatment with drugs, and has application in the broader context of respiratory disease and for drug screening.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryA semi-automated and unbiased assay based on multiscale differential dynamic microscopy (multi-DDM) detects changes in the coordination and frequency of ciliary beating in F508del/F508del primary human airway cells under different conditions and in response to CFTR-modulating compounds.",

    "abstract": "Fruit flies have eight identified Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs) involved in regulation of carbohydrate concentrations in hemolymph as well as accumulation of storage metabolites. In the present study, we investigated diet-dependent roles of DILPs encoded by genes dilp1-5, and dilp7 in regulation of insect appetite, food choice, accumulation of triglycerides, glycogen, glucose, and trehalose in fruit fly body and carbohydrates in hemolymph. We found that dilp2 gene predominantly influences body glycogen level, dilp3 - trehalose level in hemolymph, while dilp5 and dilp7 affect triglyceride level. Fruit fly appetite was found to be regulated by dilp3 and dilp7 genes. Our data contribute to the understanding of Drosophila as a model for further studies of metabolic diseases and may serve as a guide for uncovering the evolution of metabolic regulatory pathways.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTSDifferent Drosophila insulin-like peptides play distinctive roles in metabolism, physiology and appetite regulation.\\n\\nLack of Dilp2 and Dilp5 abrogates glycogen accumulation on high carbohydrate diets\\n\\nLack of Dilp3 leads to build-up of trehalose in haemolymph on high-carbohydrate-low-protein diets\\n\\nLack of Dilp3 and Dilp7 leads to increased consumption of protein on low-carbohydrate-high-protein diets\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) are chimeric proteins containing an N-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and a C-terminal extensin domain. LRXs are involved in cell wall formation in vegetative tissues and required for plant growth. However, the nature of their role in these cellular processes remains to be elucidated. Here, we used a combination of molecular techniques, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to characterize mutants of pollen-expressed LRXs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Mutations in multiple pollen-expressed lrx genes causes severe defects in pollen germination and pollen tube (PT) growth, resulting in a reduced seed set. Physiological experiments demonstrate that manipulating Ca2+ availability partially suppresses the PT growth defects, suggesting that LRX proteins influence Ca2+-related processes. Furthermore, we show that LRX protein localizes to the cell wall, and its LRR-domain (which likely mediates protein-protein interactions) is associated with the plasma membrane. Mechanical analyses by cellular force microscopy and finite element method-based modelling revealed significant changes in the material properties of the cell wall and the fine-tuning of cellular biophysical parameters in the mutants compared to the wild type. The results indicate that LRX proteins might play a role in cell wall-plasma membrane communication, influencing cell wall formation and cellular mechanics.",

    "abstract": "Among many primate species, face shape is sexually dimorphic, and male facial masculinity has been proposed to influence female mate choice and male-male competition by signalling competitive ability. However, whether conspecifics pay attention to facial masculinity has only been assessed in humans. In a study of free-ranging rhesus macaques, Macaca mulatta, we used a two-alternative look-time experiment to test whether females perceive male facial masculinity. We presented 107 females with pairs of images of male faces - one with a more masculine shape and one more feminine - and recorded their looking behaviour. Females looked at the masculine face longer than at the feminine face in more trials than predicted by chance. Although there was no overall difference in average look-time between masculine and feminine faces across all trials, females looked significantly longer at masculine faces in a subset of trials for which the within-pair difference in masculinity was most pronounced. Additionally, the proportion of time subjects looked toward the masculine face increased as the within-pair difference in masculinity increased. This study provides evidence that female macaques perceive variation in male facial shape, a necessary condition for intersexual selection to operate on such a trait. It also highlights the potential impact of perceptual thresholds on look-time experiments.",

    "abstract": "Homogentisic acid (HGA) can be oxidized by a combination of Fe2+ and H2O2 into a darkly colored high molecular mass pigment. Increasing the concentration of H2O2 can lead to the formation of a high molecular mass material that exhibits less absorbance in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum, while maintaining a strong absorbance in the UV range of the electromagnetic spectrum. FT-IR spectroscopy did indicate the presence of a chemical feature in the pigments generated through H2O2-mediated oxidation that is absent in pigments generated through air-mediated oxidation. Our observations could have implications in the pathophysiology of alkaptonuria. In alkaptonuria, patients suffer from homogentisic aciduria from birth, but develop ochronosis (darkening) of collagenous tissues much later in life due to the formation of a melanin-like pigment. Three major questions regarding ochronosis remain to be answered: 1) how is the pigment formed, 2) why does it appear by the third decade of life and 3) why is it sporadic in appearance? Our results suggest that ochronotic or non-ochronotic pigments can be generated from HGA depending on the oxidation reaction conditions. Thus, the absence of any visible pigment, as for younger alkaptonuria patients, could not necessarily mean the absence of HGA-derived melanin-like molecules. We compare our results and their potential implications for ochronosis to the changes in pigmentation observed in vitiligo or aging (greying) hair.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) is a powerful approach for studying heterogeneous tissues and dynamic cellular processes. However, compared to bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell expression profiles are extremely noisy, as they only capture a fraction of the transcripts present in the cell. Here, we propose the k-nearest neighbor smoothing (kNN-smoothing) algorithm, designed to reduce noise by aggregating information from similar cells (neighbors) in a computationally efficient and statistically tractable manner. The algorithm is based on the observation that across protocols, the technical noise exhibited by UMI-filtered scRNA-Seq data closely follows Poisson statistics. Smoothing is performed by first identifying the nearest neighbors of each cell in a step-wise fashion, based on partially smoothed and variance-stabilized expression profiles, and then aggregating their transcript counts. We show that kNN-smoothing greatly improves the detection of clusters of cells and co-expressed genes, and clearly outperforms other smoothing methods on simulated data. To accurately perform smoothing for datasets containing highly similar cell populations, we propose the kNN-smoothing 2 algorithm, in which neighbors are determined after projecting the partially smoothed data onto the first few principal components. We show that unlike its predecessor, kNN-smoothing 2 can accurately distinguish between cells from different T cell subsets, and enables their identification in peripheral blood using unsupervised methods. Our work facilitates the analysis of scRNA-Seq data across a broad range of applications, including the identification of cell populations in heterogeneous tissues and the characterization of dynamic processes such as cellular differentiation.

    "abstract": "The effects of inter-individual variability on disease treatment and prevention are important to the goals of \\\"precision medicine\\\" 1. In biomedical research, consideration of racial or ethnic differences allows generation and exploration of hypotheses about interactions among genetic and environmental factors responsible for differential medical outcomes. The US National Institutes of Health, therefore recommends adequate participation of subjects from ethnic minority groups in research studies. Nevertheless, considerable debate has focused on validity of race or ethnicity as biological construct 2. Inconsistent definition of race/ethnicity and insignificant genetic variations between ethnic groups have invited disregard to this construct 3. On the contrary, differences in prevalence, expression and outcomes of various diseases among ethnic groups argue for continued and focused attention to ethnicity as important predicting variable. In context of Alzheimers disease (AD), we have previously reported that ethnicity does moderates the proteomic markers of dementia 4. Here, we attempted to classify and predict selfreported ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic white, [NHW]) using a limited serum profile of 107 proteins. Random Forest (RF) classification method was able to discriminate those two ethnicities with 95% accuracy and could successfully predict ethnicity in an independent test-set (Area under ROC curve: 0.97). Variable selection method led to a condensed set of six proteins which yielded comparable classification and prediction accuracy. Our results provide preliminary evidence for proteomic variability between ethnic groups, and biological validity of ethnicity construct. Moreover, they also offer an opportunity to exploit these differences towards the objectives of precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSignificant improvements in the prediction of protein residue-residue contacts are observed in the recent years. These contacts, predicted using a variety of coevolution-based and machine learning methods, are the key contributors to the recent progress in ab initio protein structure prediction, as demonstrated in the recent CASP experiments. Continuing the development of new methods to reliably predict contact maps is essential to further improve ab initio structure prediction.\\n\\nResultsIn this paper we discuss DNCON2, an improved protein contact map predictor based on two-level deep convolutional neural networks. It consists of six convolutional neural networks - the first five predict contacts at 6, 7.5, 8, 8.5, and 10 [A] distance thresholds, and the last one uses these five predictions as additional features to predict final contact maps. On the free-modeling datasets in CASP10, 11, and 12 experiments, DNCON2 achieves mean precisions of 35%, 50%, and 53.4%, respectively, higher than 30.6% by MetaPSICOV on CASP10 dataset, 34% by MetaPSICOV on CASP11 dataset, and 46.3% by Raptor-X on CASP12 dataset, when top L/5 long-range contacts are evaluated. We attribute the improved performance of DNCON2 to the inclusion of short- and medium-range contacts into training, two-level approach to prediction, use of the state-of-the-art optimization and activation functions, and a novel deep learning architecture that allows each filter in a convolutional layer to access all the input features of a protein of arbitrary length.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe web server of DNCON2 is at http://sysbio.rnet.missouri.edu/dncon2/ where training and testing datasets as well as the predictions for CASP10, 11, and 12 free-modeling datasets can also be downloaded.

    "abstract": "Cereals are the key contributors to global food security. Genes involved in uptake (transport), assimilation and utilization of macro- and micro-nutrients are responsible for their content in grain and straw. Although many cereal genomic databases are available, currently there is no cohesive web-resource of manually curated nutrient use efficiency (NtUE) related genes and QTLs, etc. In this study, we present a web-resource containing information on NtUE related genes/QTLs and the corresponding available microRNAs for some of these genes in four major cereal crops [wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare)], two alien species (Triticum urartu and Aegilops tauschii) related to wheat, and two model species including Brachypodium distachyon and Arabidopsis thaliana. Gene annotations integrated in the current web-resource were collected from the existing databases and the available literature. The primary goal of developing this web-resource is to provide descriptions of the NtUE related genes and their functional annotation. MicroRNA targeting some of the NtUE related genes and the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for NtUE related traits are also included. The available information in the web-resource should help the users to readily search the desired information.\\n\\nWeb-resource URLhttp://bioclues.org/NtUE/",

    "abstract": "Advances in the immunophenotypic and cytogenetic classification of acute leukemias have led to improved clinical outcomes for a substantial fraction of patients. However, resistance to chemotherapy remains a major barrier to cure for patients with specific subsets of acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemias. Here, we propose that a molecularly distinct subtype of acute leukemia with shared myeloid and T-cell lymphoblastic features, which we term acute myeloid/T-lymphoblastic leukemia (AMTL), and has been divided between 3 diagnostic categories owing to variable expression of markers deemed to be defining of myeloid and T-cell lymphoid lineages. This new diagnostic group is supported by the i) shared hematopoietic ontogeny in which myeloid differentiation potential is specifically retained during early T-cell lymphoid development, ii) recognition of cases of AML with hallmarks of T-cell development such as clonal rearrangements of the T-cell receptor genes, and iii) identification of common gene mutations in subsets of AML and T-ALL cases. This proposed diagnostic entity overlaps with early T-cell precursor (ETP) T-ALL and T-cell/myeloid mixed phenotype acute leukemias (MPAL), and also includes a subset of leukemias currently classified as AML with hallmarks of T-lymphoblastic development. AMTLs express variable levels of both T-cell and myeloid-specific markers, such as CD3 and myeloperoxidase, and additionally have shared gene mutations including WT1, PHF6, RUNX1 and BCL11B. The proposed classification of AMTL as a distinct entity should enable prospective diagnosis and development of improved therapies for patients whose treatment is inadequate with current approaches.",

    "abstract": "Asthma exacerbations are triggered by rhinovirus infections. We employed a systems biology approach to delineate upper airway gene network patterns underlying asthma exacerbation phenotypes in children. Cluster analysis unveiled distinct IRF7hi versus IRF7lo molecular phenotypes, the former exhibiting robust upregulation of Th1/type I interferon responses and the latter an alternative signature marked by upregulation of cytokine and growth factor signalling and downregulation of interferon gamma. The two phenotypes also produced distinct clinical phenotypes. For IRF7lo versus IRF7hi: symptom duration prior to hospital presentation was more than twice as long from initial symptoms (p=0.011) and nearly three times as long for cough (p<0.001); the odds ratio of admission to hospital was increased more than four-fold (p=0.018); and time to recurrence was shorter (p=0.015). In summary, our findings demonstrate that asthma exacerbations in children can be divided into IRF7hi versus IRF7lo phenotypes with associated differences in clinical phenotypes.\\n\\nAbbreviationsAHR, airway hyperresponsiveness; ARG1, Arginase 1, CSF3, Colony Stimulating Factor 3; CD38, Cluster of Differentiation 38; CD163, Cluster of Differentiation 163; cDCs, conventional (or myeloid) dendritic cells; DDX60, DExD/H-Box Helicase 60; ED, Emergency Department; EGF, Epidermal Growth Factor; ERK, Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase; FCER1G, Fc Fragment Of IgE Receptor Ig; HMBS, Hydroxymethylbilane Synthase; IFNg, Interferon Gamma; IFNL1, Interferon Lambda 1; IL-1R2, Interleukin 1 Receptor Type 2; IRF7, Interferon Regulatory Factor 7; ISG15, Interferon-stimulated gene 15; MDA5, Melanoma Differentiation-Associated protein 5; MX1, Myxovirus Resistance Protein 1; NAD, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NCR1, Natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 1; OSM, Oncostatin M; PD-L1, Programmed Death-Ligand 1; PPIA, Peptidylprolyl Isomerase A; PPIB Peptidylprolyl Isomerase B; RSAD2, Radical S-adenosyl methionine domain-containing protein 2; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; RT-qPCR, quantitative reverse transcription PCR; RV, rhinovirus; sPLA2, secretory Phospholipase A2; TGFb, Transforming Growth Factor beta; THBS1, Thrombospondin 1; TNF, Tumor Necrosis Factor; TLR2, Toll-like Receptor 2.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) forms a gateway for nucleocytoplasmic transport. The outer ring protein complex of the NPC (the Nup107-160 subcomplex in humans) is a key component for building the NPC. Nup107-160 subcomplexes are believed to be symmetrically localized on the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides of the NPC. However, in S. pombe immunoelectron and fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed that the homologous components of the human Nup107-160 subcomplex had an asymmetrical localization: constituent proteins spNup132 and spNup107 were present only on the nuclear side (designated the spNup132 subcomplex), while spNup131, spNup120, spNup85, spNup96, spNup37, spEly5 and spSeh1 were localized only on the cytoplasmic side (designated the spNup120 subcomplex), suggesting the complex was split into two pieces at the interface between spNup96 and spNup107. This contrasts with the symmetrical localization reported in other organisms. Fusion of spNup96 (cytoplasmic localization) with spNup107 (nuclear localization) caused cytoplasmic relocalization of spNup107. In this strain, half of the spNup132 proteins, which interact with spNup107, changed their localization to the cytoplasmic side of the NPC, leading to defects in mitotic and meiotic progression similar to an spNup132 deletion strain. These observations suggest the asymmetrical localization of the outer ring spNup132 and spNup120 subcomplexes of the NPC is necessary for normal cell cycle progression in fission yeast.\n\nAuthor summaryThe nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) form gateways to transport intracellular molecules between the nucleus and the cytoplasm across the nuclear envelope. The Nup107-160 subcomplex, that forms nuclear and cytoplasmic outer rings, is a key complex responsible for building the NPC by symmetrical localization on the nuclear and cytoplasmic sides of the nuclear pore. This structural characteristic was found in various organisms including humans and budding yeasts, and therefore believed to be common among \"all\" eukaryotes. However, in this paper, we revealed an asymmetrical localization of the homologous components of the human Nup107-160 subcomplex in fission yeast by immunoelectron and fluorescence microscopic analyses: in this organism, the Nup107-160 subcomplex is split into two pieces, and each of the split pieces is differentially distributed to the nuclear and cytoplasmic side of the NPC: one piece is only in the nuclear side while the other piece is only in the cytoplasmic side. This contrasts with the symmetrical localization reported in other organisms. In addition, we confirmed that the asymmetrical configuration of the outer ring structure is necessary for cell cycle progression in fission yeast. This study provides notions of diverse structures and functions of NPCs evolved in eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination is essential for crossover (CO) formation and accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis. It is of considerable importance to work out how recombination intermediates are processed leading to CO and non-crossover (NCO) outcome. Genetic analysis in budding yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans indicates that the processing of meiotic recombination intermediates involves a combination of nucleases and DNA repair enzymes. We previously reported that in C. elegans meiotic Holiday junction resolution is mediated by two redundant pathways, conferred by the SLX-1 and MUS-81 nucleases, and by the HIM-6 Blooms helicase in conjunction with the XPF-1 endonucleases, respectively. Both pathways require the scaffold protein SLX-4. However, in the absence of all these enzymes residual processing of meiotic recombination intermediates still occurs and CO formation is reduced but not abolished. Here we show that the LEM-3 nuclease, mutation of which by itself does not have an overt meiotic phenotype, genetically interacts with slx-1 and mus-81 mutants, the respective double mutants leading to 100% embryonic lethality. LEM-3 and MUS-81 act redundantly, their combined loss leading to a reduced number of early meiotic recombination intermediates, to a delayed disassembly of foci associated with CO designated sites, and to the formation of univalents linked by SPO-11 dependent chromatin bridges (dissociated bivalents). However, LEM-3 foci do not co-localize with ZHP-3 a marker that congresses into CO designated sites. In addition, neither CO frequency nor distribution is altered in lem-3 single mutants or in combination with mus-81 or slx-4 mutations, indicating that LEM-3 drives NCO outcome. Finally, we found persistent chromatin bridges during meiotic divisions in lem-3; slx-4 double mutants. Supported by the localization of LEM-3 between dividing meiotic nuclei, this data suggests that LEM-3 is able to process erroneous recombination intermediates that persist into the second meiotic divisions.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMeiotic recombination is required for genetic diversity and for the proper chromosome segregation. Recombination intermediates, such as Holliday junctions (HJs), are generated and eventually resolved to produce crossover (CO) and non-crossover (NCO). While an excess of meiotic double-strand breaks is generated, most breaks are repaired without leading to a CO outcome and usually only one break for each chromosome pair matures into a CO-designated site in Caenorhabditis elegans. Resolution of meiotic recombination intermediates and CO formation have been reported to be highly regulated by several structure-specific endonucleases and the Bloom helicase. However, little is known about enzymes involved in the NCO recombination intermediate resolution. In this study, we found that a conserved nuclease LEM-3/Ankle1 acts in parallel to the SLX-1/MUS-81 pathway to process meiotic recombination intermediates. Mutation of lem-3 has no effect on CO frequency and distribution, indicating LEM-3 functions as a nuclease promoting NCO outcome. Interestingly, a prominent localization of LEM-3 is found between dividing meiotic nuclei. We provide evidence that LEM-3 is also involved in processing remaining, erroneous recombination intermediates during meiotic divisions.",

Elucidating the mechanisms of action of drug treatments in humans is challenging, but application of functional genomic approaches in randomised trials may afford an opportunity to systematically assess molecular responses to treatments. In the Biochemical Efficacy and Safety Trial of Vitamin D (BEST-D), 305 community-dwelling individuals aged over 65 years were randomly allocated to treatment with vitamin D34000 IU, 2000 IU or placebo daily for 12 months. Genome-wide genotypes at baseline, and transcriptome and plasma levels of cytokines (IFN-{gamma}, IL-10, IL-8, IL-6 and TNF-) at baseline and after 12 months, were measured. The trial had >90% power to detect a 2-fold change in gene expression. Allocation to vitamin D for 12-months was associated with 2-fold higher plasma levels of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25[OH]D), but had no significant effect on whole-blood gene expression (FDR <5%) or on plasma levels of cytokines compared with placebo. In pre-specified analysis, rs7041 (intron variant, GC) had a significant effect on circulating levels of 25(OH)D in the low dose but not on the placebo or high dose vitamin D regimen. A gene expression quantitative trait locus analysis (eQTL) demonstrated evidence of 31,568 cis-eQTLs (unique SNP-probe pairs) among individuals at baseline and 34,254 after supplementation for 12 months (any dose), but had no significant effect on cis-eQTLs specific to vitamin D supplementation.

    "abstract": "Fertilisation triggers embryonic development culminating with the activation of a number of highly co-ordinated and evolutionarily conserved signalling pathways, which induce and pattern the mesoderm of the developing embryo. Previous studies in invertebrates have shown that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), a reactive oxygen species (ROS), can act as a signalling molecule for axis specification during early development. Using a HyPer transgenic Xenopus laevis line that expresses a H2O2-sensitive fluorescent protein sensor maternally, we recently found that fertilisation triggers a rapid increase in ROS production. Here we show that this increase in ROS levels is sustained throughout early embryogenesis, lasting until the tailbud stages. In addition we show that lowering ROS levels from the blastula stage through the gastrula stages via antioxidant treatments disrupts mesoderm formation. Furthermore, we show that attenuating ROS levels during the blastula / gastrula stages affects some, but not all, growth factor signalling pathways involved in mesoderm induction and patterning, including the PI3K/Akt, TGF-{beta}/Nodal, and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling pathways. These data suggest that sustained elevated ROS levels during the blastula and gastrula stages are essential for early vertebrate embryonic development, at least partly, through their roles in promoting growth factor signalling.",

While low migration rates prevent local populations from becoming extinct, high migration rates enhance the risk of global extinction by synchronizing the dynamics of connected populations. Here, we investigate this trade-off using two mutualistic strains of E. coli that exhibit population oscillations when co-cultured. In experiments, as well as in simulations using a mechanistic model, we observe that high migration rates lead to in-phase synchronization whereas intermediate migration rates perturb the oscillations and change their period. Further, our simulations predict, and experiments show, that connected populations subjected to more challenging antibiotic concentrations have the highest probability of survival at intermediate migration rates. Finally, we identify altered population dynamics, rather than recolonization, as the primary cause of extended survival.",

We used a twin family design to assess this association at two life points and applied a novel analytical approach to investigate the evidence for causality.\\n\\nMethodsThe methylation profile of DNA from peripheral blood was measured for 479 Australian women (mean age 56 years) from 130 twin families. Linear regression was used to estimate the associations of methylation at ~410 000 cytosine-guanine dinucleotides (CpG), and of the average methylation at ~20 000 genes, with current BMI, BMI at age 18-21 years, and the change between the two (BMI change). A novel regression-based methodology for twins, Inference about Causation through Examination of Familial Confounding (ICE FALCON), was used to assess causation.\\n\\nResultsAt 5% false discovery rate, nine, six and 12 CpGs at 24 loci were associated with current BMI, BMI at age 18-21 years and BMI change, respectively. The average methylation of BHLHE40 and SOCS3 loci was associated with current BMI, and of PHGDH locus was associated with BMI change. From the ICE FALCON analyses with BMI as the predictor and methylation as the outcome, a womans methylation level was associated with her co-twins BMI, and the association disappeared conditioning on her own BMI, consistent with BMI causing methylation. To the contrary, using methylation as the predictor and BMI as the outcome, a womans BMI was not associated with her co-twins methylation level, consistent with methylation not causing BMI.\\n\\nConclusionFor middle-aged women, peripheral blood DNA methylation at several genomic locations is associated with current BMI, BMI at age 18-21 years and BMI change. Our study suggests that BMI has a causal effect on peripheral blood DNA methylation.",

    "abstract": "Subpopulations of the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (26 sample groups composed of 794 strains) were collected in two nearby wheat fields in the Paris basin, during both epidemic and inter-epidemic periods of three successive years (2009-2013). In addition to the type of inoculum (ascospores vs. pycnidiospores), the alternative presence of wheat debris allowed taking into account its putative origin (local vs. distant). We used a molecular epidemiology approach, based on population genetic indices derived from SSR marker analysis, to describe putative changes in the structure and genotypic diversity of these subpopulations over three years, at a spatiotemporal scale consistent with epidemiological observations. Genetic structure was stable over time (within and between years) and between fields. All subpopulations displayed very high levels of gene and genotypic diversity. The low levels of linkage disequilibrium and the very low clonal fraction at all stages were consistent with the regular occurrence of sexual reproduction in the two fields. A significant increase of the MAT1-1/MAT1-2 ratio was observed over the course of the epidemics, suggesting a competitive advantage of MAT1-1 strains consistently with their greater pathogenicity reported in the literature. Finally, we found that the period, the type of inoculum and its putative origin had little effect on the short term evolution of the local population of Z. tritici. Fungal population size and diversity are apparently large enough to prevent genetic drift at this fine spatiotemporal scale, and more likely short distance migration contributes strongly to the stabilization of genetic diversity among and within plots.",

    "abstract": "Integrating genome-wide association (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data into transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) based on predicted expression can boost power to detect novel disease loci or pinpoint the susceptibility gene at a known disease locus. However, it is often the case that multiple eQTL genes colocalize at disease loci, making the identification of the true susceptibility gene challenging, due to confounding through linkage disequilibrium (LD). To distinguish between true susceptibility genes (where the genetic effect on phenotype is mediated through expression) and colocalization due to LD, we examine an extension of the Mendelian Randomization Egger regression method that allows for LD while only requiring summary association data for both GWAS and eQTL. We derive the standard TWAS approach in the context of Mendelian Randomization and show in simulations that the standard TWAS does not control Type I error for causal gene identification when eQTLs have pleiotropic or LD-confounded effects on disease. In contrast, LD Aware MR-Egger regression can control Type I error in this case while attaining similar power as other methods in situations where these provide valid tests. However, when the direct effects of genetic variants on traits are correlated with the eQTL associations, all of the methods we examined including LD Aware MR-Egger regression can have inflated Type I error. We illustrate these methods by integrating gene expression within a recent large-scale breast cancer GWAS to provide guidance on susceptibility gene identification.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe incidence of Escherichia coli bloodstream infections (EC-BSIs), particularly those caused by antibiotic-resistant strains, is increasing in the UK and internationally. This is a major public health concern but the evidence base to guide interventions is limited.\\n\\nMethodsIncidence of EC-BSIs and E. coli urinary tract infections (EC-UTIs) in one UK region (Oxfordshire) were estimated from anonymised linked microbiological and hospital electronic health records, and modelled using negative binomial regression based on microbiological, clinical and healthcare exposure risk factors. Infection severity, 30-day allcause mortality, and community and hospital co-amoxiclav use were also investigated.\\n\\nFindingsFrom 1998-2016, 5706 EC-BSIs occurred in 5215 patients, and 228376 EC-UTIs in 137075 patients. 1365(24%) EC-BSIs were nosocomial (onset >48h post-admission), 1863(33%) were community (>365 days post-discharge), 1346(24%) were quasi-community (31-365 days post-discharge), and 1132(20%) were quasi-nosocomial ([&le;]30 days postdischarge). 1413(20%) EC-BSIs and 36270(13%) EC-UTIs were co-amoxiclav-resistant (41% and 30%, respectively, in 2016). Increases in EC-BSIs were driven by increases in community (10%/year (95% CI:7%-13%)) and quasi-community (8%/year (95% CI:7%-10%)) cases. Changes in EC-BSI-associated 30-day mortality were at most modest (p>0{middle dot}03), and mortality was substantial (14-25% across groups). By contrast, co-amoxiclav-resistant EC-BSIs increased in all groups (by 11%-19%/year, significantly faster than susceptible EC-BSIs, pheterogeneity<0{middle dot}001), as did co-amoxiclav-resistant EC-UTIs (by 13%-29%/year, pheterogeneity*0{middle dot}001). Co-amoxiclav use in primary-care facilities was associated with subsequent co-amoxiclav-resistant EC-UTIs (p=0{middle dot}03) and all EC-UTIs (p=0{middle dot}002).\\n\\nInterpretationCurrent increases in EC-BSIs in Oxfordshire are primarily community-associated, with high rates of co-amoxiclav resistance, nevertheless not impacting mortality. Interventions should target primary-care facilities with high co-amoxiclav usage.\\n\\nFundingNational Institute for Health Research.\\n\\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for publications from inception up until October 26, 2017, with the terms \\\"Escherichia coli\\\", \\\"E. coli\\\", \\\"bacteraemia\\\", \\\"bloodstream infection\\\", restricting the search to English language articles, and also reviewed references from retrieved articles. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most common cause of bloodstream infection, and the incidence of E. coli bloodstream infection, and particularly antibiotic-resistant infections, is increasing in the UK and internationally. Although the UK government aims to reduce healthcare-associated E. coli bloodstream infection, there is only limited evidence to inform appropriate interventions.\\n\\nAdded value of this studyWe investigated potential drivers for these increases in incidence by exploiting available linked electronic health records over 19 years for ~5200 patients with E. coli bloodstream infection and ~140000 with E. coli urinary tract infection, together with community antimicrobial prescribing data for the most recent six years. Our study identified several findings with significant implications for health policy and patient care: O_LIIncreases in the incidence of E. coli bloodstream infections were driven mainly by non-hospital-associated cases; however, neither patients with previous urinary tract infections nor having previously had urine specimens sent from catheters appeared to be driving the increases\\nC_LIO_LICo-amoxiclav-resistant bloodstream infections rose significantly faster than co-amoxiclav-susceptible bloodstream infections, with the greatest number of co-amoxiclav-resistant bloodstream infections in 2016 being in patients discharged more than a month previously (i.e. community-associated)\\nC_LIO_LIHigher co-amoxiclav use in primary care was associated with higher rates of both co-amoxiclav-resistant E. coli urinary tract infections and E. coli urinary tract infections overall, supporting drives to reduce broad-spectrum and inappropriate antibiotic use in primary care\\nC_LIO_LIDespite substantial increases in co-amoxiclav-resistant bloodstream infections there was no evidence that mortality was increasing in these cases; this does not support moving to broader empiric antibiotic prescribing in hospitals (i.e. carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam)\\nC_LI\\n\\nImplications of all available adviceThis suggests that government strategies to effectively reduce E. coli bloodstream infections should target community settings, as well as healthcare-associated settings. The absence of an increased mortality signal suggests that co-amoxiclav resistant E. coli infections are either being successfully treated by dual empiric therapy in severe cases (e.g. with concomitant gentamicin), can be \\\"rescued\\\" once isolate susceptibilities become available, or currently deployed phenotypic susceptibility testing breakpoints do not adequately correlate with clinical outcome.",

    "abstract": "In the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), selenium supplementation (causing a median 114 g/L increase in circulating selenium) did not lower overall prostate cancer risk, but increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer and type 2 diabetes. Mendelian randomization analysis uses genetic variants to proxy modifiable risk factors and can strengthen causal inference in observational studies. We constructed a genetic risk score comprising eleven single-nucleotide polymorphisms robustly (P<5x10-8) associated with circulating selenium in genome-wide association studies. In a Mendelian randomization analysis of 72,729 men in the PRACTICAL Consortium (44,825 cases, 27,904 controls), 114 g/L higher genetically-elevated circulating selenium was not associated with prostate cancer (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 0.89-1.13). Concordant with findings from SELECT, selenium was weakly associated with advanced (including high-grade) prostate cancer (OR: 1.21; 95% CI: 0.98-1.49) and type 2 diabetes (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.97-1.43; in a type 2 diabetes GWAS meta-analysis with up to 49,266 cases, 249,906 controls).

    "abstract": "The recent range expansion of human babesiosis in the northeastern United States, once found only in restricted coastal sites, is not well understood. This study sought to utilize a large number of samples to examine the population structure of the parasites on a fine scale to provide insights into the mode of emergence across the region. 228 B. microti samples collected in endemic northeastern U.S. sites were genotyped using published VNTR markers. The genetic diversity and population structure were analysed on a geographic scale using Phyloviz and TESS. Three distinct populations were detected in northeastern US, each dominated by a single ancestral type. In contrast to the limited range of the Nantucket and Cape Cod populations, the mainland population dominated from New Jersey eastward to Boston. Ancestral populations of B. microti were sufficiently isolated to differentiate into distinct populations. Despite this, a single population was detected across a large geographic area of the northeast that historically had at least 3 distinct foci of transmission, central New Jersey, Long Island and southeastern Connecticut. We conclude that a single B. microti genotype has expanded across the northeastern U.S. The biological attributes associated with this parasite genotype that have contributed to such a selective sweep remain to be identified.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBabesiosis is a disease caused by a protozoan parasite, Babesia microti, related to malaria. The disease is acquired by the bite of the deer tick, the same tick that transmits Lyme disease. Although Lyme disease rapidly emerged over a wide range within the last 40 years, babesiosis remained rare with an extremely focal distribution. Within the last decade, the number of reports of babesiosis cases has increased from an expanded area of risk, particularly across the mainland of southern New England. We determined whether the expanded risk may be due to local intensification of transmission as opposed to introduction of the parasite. Historical fragmentation of the landscape suggests that sites of B. microti transmission should have been isolated and thus evidence of multiple genetically distinct populations should be found. By a genetic fingerprinting method, we found that samples from the new mainland sites were all genetically similar. We conclude that one parasite genetic lineage has recently expanded its distribution and now dominates, suggesting that it has some phenotypic attribute that may confer a selective advantage over others.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe health-risk assessment paradigm is shifting from single stressor evaluation towards cumulative assessments of multiple stressors. Recent efforts to develop broad-scale public health hazard datasets provide an opportunity to develop and evaluate multiple exposure hazards in combination.\\n\\nMethodsWe performed a multivariate study of the spatial relationship between 12 indicators of environmental hazard, 5 indicators of socioeconomic hardship, and 3 health outcomes. Indicators were obtained from CalEnviroScreen (version 3.0), a publicly available environmental justice screening tool developed by the State of California Environmental Protection Agency. The indicators were compared to the total rate of hospitalization for 14 ICD-9 disease categories (a measure of disease burden) at the zip code tabulation area population level. We performed principal component analysis to visualize and reduce the CalEnviroScreen data and spatial autoregression to evaluate associations with disease burden.\\n\\nResultsCalEnviroScreen was strongly associated with the first principal component (PC) from a principal component analysis (PCA) of all 20 variables (Spearman {rho} = 0.95). In a PCA of the 12 environmental variables, two PC axes explained 43% of variance, with the first axis indicating industrial activity and air pollution, and the second associated with ground-level ozone, drinking water contamination and PM2.5. Mass of pesticides used in agriculture was poorly or negatively correlated with all other environmental indicators, and with the CalEnviroScreen calculation method, suggesting a limited ability of the method to capture agricultural exposures. In a PCA of the 5 socioeconomic variables, the first PC explained 66% of variance, representing overall socioeconomic hardship. In simultaneous autoregressive models, the first environmental and socioeconomic PCs were both significantly associated with the disease burden measure, but more model variation was explained by the socioeconomic PCs.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study supports the use of CalEnviroScreen for its intended purpose of screening California regions for areas with high environmental exposure and population vulnerability. Study results further suggest a hypothesis that, compared to environmental pollutant exposure, socioeconomic status has greater impact on overall burden of disease.",

    "abstract": "Despite accumulating evidence that evolution can be predictable, studies quantifying the predictability of evolution remain rare. Here, we measured the predictability of genome-wide evolutionary changes associated with a recent host shift in the Melissa blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa). We asked whether and to what extent genome-wide patterns of evolutionary change in nature could be predicted (1) by comparisons among instances of repeated evolution, and (2) from SNP x performance associations in a lab experiment. We delineated the genetic loci (SNPs) most strongly associated with host use in two L. melissa lineages that colonized alfalfa. Whereas most SNPs were strongly associated with host use in none or one of these lineages, we detected a ~two-fold excess of SNPs associated with host use in both lineages. Similarly, we found that host-associated SNPs in nature could also be partially predicted from SNP x performance (survival and weight) associations in a lab rearing experiment. But the extent of overlap, and thus degree of predictability, was somewhat reduced. Although we were able to predict (to a modest extent) the SNPs most strongly associated with host use in nature (in terms of parallelism and from the experiment), we had little to no ability to predict the direction of evolutionary change during the colonization of alfalfa. Our results show that different aspects of evolution associated with recent adaptation can be more or less predictable, and highlight how stochastic and deterministic processes interact to drive patterns of genome-wide evolutionary change.",

Our BPD, BD-I and BD-II associations were significantly more likely to be differentially expressed in post-mortem brain tissue of BPD, BD-I and BD-II cases than we might expect by chance. Together with our pathway analysis, our results support long-standing hypotheses about bipolar disorder risk, including a role for oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, the post-synaptic density, and an enrichment of circadian rhythm and clock genes within our results.",

    "abstract": "Meta-analysis of genetic association studies increases sample size and the power for mapping complex traits. Existing methods are mostly developed for datasets without missing values. In practice, genotype imputation is not always effective, e.g. when targeted genotyping/sequencing assays are used or when the un-typed genetic variant is rare. Therefore, contributed summary statistics often contain missing values. Naive extensions of existing methods either replace missing summary statistics with 0 or discard studies with missing data. These approaches can bias genetic effect estimates and lead to seriously inflated type-I or II errors in conditional analysis, which is a critical tool for identifying independently associated variants.\\n\\nTo address this challenge and complement imputation methods, we developed a method to combine summary statistics across participating studies and consistently estimate joint effects, even when the contributed summary statistics contain large amount of missing values. Based on this estimator, we propose a score statistic we call PCBS (partial correlation based score statistic) for conditional analysis of single-variant and gene-level associations. Through extensive analysis of simulated and real data, we showed that the new method produces well-calibrated type-I errors and is substantially more powerful than existing approaches. We applied the proposed approach to analyze the CHRNA5-CHRNB4-CHRNA3 locus in a large-scale meta-analysis for cigarettes-per-day. Using the new method, we identified three novel variants, independent of known association signals, which were otherwise missed by alternative methods. Together, the phenotypic variance explained by these variants is .46%, improving that of previously reported associations by 17%. These findings illustrate the extent of locus allelic heterogeneity and can help pinpoint causal variants.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIt is of great interest to estimate the joint and conditional effects of multiple correlated variants from large scale meta-analysis, in order to fine map causal variants and understand the genetic architecture for complex traits. The contributed summary statistics from participating studies in a meta-analysis often contain missing values, as the imputation methods are not often effective, especially when the underlying genetic variant is rare or the participating studies use targeted genotyping array that is not suitable for imputation. Existing meta-analysis methods do not properly handle missing data, and can incorrectly estimate correlations between score statistics. As a result, they can produce highly biased estimates of joint effects and highly inflated type-I errors for conditional analysis, which will in turn result in overestimated phenotypic variance explained and incorrect identification of causal variants. We systematically evaluated this bias and proposed a novel partial correlation based score statistic. The new statistic has valid type-I errors for conditional analysis and much higher power than the existing methods, even when the contributed summary statistics in the meta-analysis contain a large fraction of missing values. We expect this method to be highly useful in the sequencing age for complex trait genetics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe explosive growth in known human gene variation presents enormous challenges to current approaches for variant classification that impact diagnosis and treatment of many genetic diseases. For disorders caused by mutations in cardiac ion channels, such as congenital long-QT syndrome (LQTS), in vitro electrophysiological evidence has high value in discriminating pathogenic from benign variants, but these data are often lacking because assays are cost-, time- and labor-intensive.\\n\\nMethods and ResultsWe implemented a strategy for performing high throughput, functional evaluations of ion channel variants that repurposed an automated electrophysiology platform developed previously for drug discovery. We demonstrated success of this approach by evaluating 78 variants in KCNQ1, a major LQTS gene. We benchmarked our results with traditional electrophysiological approaches and observed a high level of concordance. Our results provided functional data useful for classifying ~70% of previously unstudied KCNQ1 variants annotated with uninformative descriptions in the public database ClinVar. Further, we show that rare and ultra-rare KCNQ1 variants in the general population exhibit functional properties ranging from normal to severe loss-of-function indicating that allele frequency is not a reliable predictor of channel function.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results illustrate an efficient and high throughput paradigm linking genotype to function for a human cardiac channelopathy that will enable data-driven classification of large numbers of variants and create new opportunities for precision medicine.",

We present the first genome-wide characterization of the sex-specific genetic architecture of OCD, utilizing the largest set of OCD cases and controls available from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. We assessed evidence for several mechanisms that may contribute to sexual-dimorphism including a sexually dimorphic liability threshold, the presence of individual sex-specific risk variants on the autosomes and the X chromosome, genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity, and sex-specific pleiotropic effects. We observed a strong genetic correlation between male and female OCD and no evidence for a sexually dimorphic liability threshold model. While we did not detect any sex-specific genome-wide associations, we observed that the SNPs with sexually dimorphic effects showed an enrichment of regulatory variants influencing expression of genes in immune tissues. Furthermore, top sex-specific genome-wide associations were enriched for regulatory variants in different tissues, suggesting evidence for potential sex difference in the biology underlying risk for OCD. These findings suggest that future studies with larger sample sizes hold great promise for the identification of sex-specific risk factors for OCD, significantly advancing our understanding of the differences in the genetic basis of sexually dimorphic neuropsychiatric traits.",

Many of these actinobacteria belong to the family of Streptomycetaceae with Streptomyces olivochromogenes and Streptomyces clavifer as well represented species. When seeds of Arabidopsis were inoculated with spores of Streptomyces strain coa1, which shows high similarity to S. olivochromogenes, roots were colonised intercellularly and, unexpectedly, also intracellularly.

Loss-of-function of OsPGLl resulted in defect of chloroplast RNA editing at ndhD-878 and mitochondrial RNA editing at ccmFc-543, which can be restored via complementary validation.

    "abstract": "Arboviruses such as Zika virus (ZIKV, Flaviviridae; Flavivirus) replicate in both mammalian and insect hosts where they encounter a variety of distinct host defenses. To overcome these pressures, arboviruses exist as diverse populations of distinct genomes. However, transmission between hosts and replication within hosts can involve genetic bottlenecks, during which population size and viral diversity may be significantly reduced, potentially resulting in large fitness losses. Understanding the points at which bottlenecks exist during arbovirus transmission is critical to identifying targets for preventing transmission. To study these bottleneck effects, we constructed 4 \\\"barcoded\\\" ZIKV clones - 2 with an 8-base-pair degenerate insertion in the 3 UTR and 2 with 8 or 9 degenerate synonymous changes in the coding sequence, theoretically containing thousands of variants each. We passaged these viruses 3 times each in 2 mammalian and 2 mosquito cell lines and characterized selection of the \\\"barcode\\\" populations using deep sequencing. Additionally, the viruses were used to feed three recently field-caught populations of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to assess bottlenecks in a natural host. The barcoded viruses replicated well in multiple cell lines in vitro and in vivo in mosquitoes and could be characterized using next-generation sequencing. The stochastic nature of mosquito transmission was clearly shown by tracking individual barcodes in Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Barcoded viruses provide an efficient method to examine bottlenecks during virus infection.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn general, mosquito-borne viruses like ZIKV must replicate in two very different host environments: an insect and a mammalian host. RNA viruses such as ZIKV must maintain genetic diversity in order to adapt to these changing conditions. During this transmission cycle, several barriers exist which can severely restrict viral genetic diversity, causing bottlenecks in the virus population. It is critical to understand these bottlenecks during virus transmission as this will provide important insights into the selective forces shaping arbovirus evolution within and between hots. Here, we employ a set of barcoded ZIKV constructs containing a degenerate stretch of nucleotides that can be tracked using next-generation sequencing. We found that the insertion site in the genome was an important determinant of the resulting diversity of the genetic barcode. We also found that bottlenecks varied between different mosquito populations and patterns of genetic diversity were distinct among individual mosquitoes within a single population, highlighting the randomness of virus dissemination in mosquitoes. Our study characterizes a new tool for tracking bottlenecks during virus transmission in vivo and highlights the importance of both viral and host factors on the maintenance of viral diversity.",

    "abstract": "Resting state (RS) connectivity has been increasingly studied in healthy and diseased brains in humans and animals. This paper presents a new method to analyze RS data from fMRI that combines multiple seed correlation analysis with graph-theory (MSRA). We characterize and evaluate this new method in relation to two other graph-theoretical methods and ICA. The graph-theoretical methods calculate cross-correlations of regional average time-courses, one using seed regions of the same size (SRCC) and the other using whole brain structure regions (RCCA). We evaluated the reproducibility, power, and capacity of these methods to characterize short term RS modulation to unilateral physiological whisker stimulation in rats. Graph-theoretical networks found with the MSRA approach were highly reproducible, and their communities showed large overlaps with ICA components. Additionally, MSRA was the only one of all tested methods that had the power to detect significant RS modulations induced by whisker stimulation that are controlled by family-wise error rate (FWE). Compared to the reduced resting state network connectivity during task performance, these modulations implied decreased connectivity strength in the bilateral sensorimotor and entorhinal cortex. Additionally, the contralateral ventromedial thalamus (part of the barrel field related lemniscal pathway) and the hypothalamus showed reduced connectivity. Enhanced connectivity was observed in the amygdala, especially the contralateral basolateral amygdala (involved in emotional learning processes). In conclusion, MSRA is a powerful analytical approach that can reliably detect tiny modulations of RS connectivity. It shows a great promise as a method for studying RS dynamics in healthy and pathological conditions.",

Although generally suppressing cognition and attention, tonic pain needs to allow effective relief learning so that the cause of the pain can be reduced if possible. Here, we describe a central learning circuit that supports learning of relief and concurrently suppresses the level of ongoing pain. We used computational modelling of behavioural, physiological and neuroimaging data in two experiments in which subjects learned to terminate tonic pain in static and dynamic escape-learning paradigms. In both studies, we show that active relief-seeking involves a reinforcement learning process manifest by error signals observed in the dorsal putamen. Critically, this system also uses an uncertainty ( associability) signal detected in pregenual anterior cingulate cortex that both controls the relief learning rate, and endogenously and parametrically modulates the level of tonic pain. The results define a self-organising learning circuit that allows reduction of ongoing pain when learning about potential relief.",

We optogenetically manipulate VTA axon terminals in singing birds contingent on how the pitch of individual song syllables are naturally performed. We find that optical excitation and inhibition of VTA terminals have opponent effects on future performances of targeted song syllables and are each sufficient to reliably guide learned changes in song, consistent with positive and negative reinforcement of performance outcomes. These findings define a central role for reinforcement mechanisms in learning vocalizations and provide the first demonstration of minimal circuit elements for learning vocal behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The olfactory bulb (OB) is the very first site of odor information processing, yet a wealth of contextual and learned information has been described in its activity. To investigate the mechanistic basis of contextual modulation, we use whole-cell recordings to measure odor responses across rapid (<30 min) learning episodes in identified mitral/tufted cells (MTCs). Across these learning episodes, we found that diverse response changes occur already during the first sniff cycle. Motivated mice develop active sniffing strategies across learning, and it is this change of active sampling state that dynamically modulates odor responses, resulting in enhanced discriminability and detectability of odor representation with learning. Evoking fast sniffing in different behavioral states demonstrates that response changes during active sampling exceed those predicted from purely feed-forward input. Finally, response changes are highly correlated in tufted cells, but not mitral cells, indicating cell-type specificity in the effect of active sampling, and resulting in increased odor detectability in the tufted and enhanced discriminability in the mitral cell population over the rapid learning episodes. Altogether, we show that active sampling state is a crucial component in modulating and enhancing olfactory bulb responsiveness on rapid timescales.",

    "abstract": "The recent advent of individualized resting-state network mapping (RSNM) has revealed substantial inter-individual variability in anatomical localization of brain networks identified using resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI). Such variability may be particularly important after repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI), which is associated with treatment-resistant depression. RSNM enables personalized targeting of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a focal brain stimulation technique that relieves depression when administered over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\\n\\nRSNM was used to identify left/right dorsolateral prefrontal rTMS targets with maximal difference between dorsal attention network and default mode network (DMN) correlations. These targets were spatially distinct from those identified by prior methods. The method was evaluated by administering twenty sessions of left-sided excitatory and right-sided inhibitory rTMS to a retired NFL defensive lineman with progressive treatment-resistant neuropsychiatric disturbances. Treatment led to improvement in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (72%), cognitive testing, and headache scales. In comparison with healthy individuals and subjects with TBI-associated depression, baseline rsfMRI revealed substantially elevated DMN connectivity with medial temporal lobe (MTL). Serial rsfMRI scans showed gradual improvement in MTL-DMN connectivity and stimulation site connectivity with subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. This highlights the possibility of individualized neuromodulation and biomarker-based monitoring for neuropsychiatric sequelae of repetitive TBI.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal signals are usually characterized in terms of their discharge rate. However, this level of description is inadequate to account for the complex temporal organization of spike trains. In particular, fractal and multifractal patterns can be described using methods based on the so-called structure functions. Here, increasing order temporal structure functions are applied to neuronal signals obtained from the globus pallidus interna (GPi) of patients with Parkinsons disease. It is shown that these spike trains exhibit a characteristic multifractal spectrum, which is interpreted as a hallmark of the neuronal activity of the human, parkinsonian basal ganglia. Further, a neural field model is proposed to study the observed multifractality. The model consists of a partial differential equation that relates temporal to spatial activity considering a gradient field and a diffusive term. As the model is perturbed with stochastic initial conditions, the following is observed: 1. multifractality depends on the diffusive term; 2. multifractality is present for a range of diffusion coefficients; and 3. multifractal temporal properties are mirrored in space, which can be explained from the physical properties of the electric field governing neuronal activity. These results predict that passive electric properties of neuronal activity are far more relevant to the human brain than what has been usually considered.",

    "abstract": "Surface color appearance depends on both local surface chromaticity and global context. How are these inter-dependencies supported by cortical networks? Combining functional imaging and psychophysics, we examined if color from long-range filling-in engages distinct pathways from responses caused by a field of uniform chromaticity. We find that color from filling-in is best classified and best correlated with appearance by two dorsal areas, V3A and V3B/KO. In contrast, a field of uniform chromaticity is best classified by ventral areas hV4 and LO. Dynamic causal modeling revealed feedback modulation from area V3A to areas V1 and LO for filling-in, contrasting with feedback from LO modulating areas V1 and V3A for a matched uniform chromaticity. These results indicate a dorsal stream role in color filling-in via feedback modulation of area V1 coupled with a cross-stream modulation of ventral areas suggesting that local and contextual influences on color appearance engage distinct neural networks.",

    "abstract": "Only a small percentage of the genome sequence is involved in regulation of gene expression, but to biochemically identify this portion is expensive and laborious. In species like maize, with diverse intergenic regions and lots of repetitive elements, this is an especially challenging problem. While regulatory regions are rare, they do have characteristic chromatin contexts and sequence organization (the grammar) with which they can be identified. We developed a computational framework to exploit this sequence arrangement. The models learn to classify regulatory regions based on sequence features - k-mers. To do this, we borrowed two approaches from the field of natural language processing: (1) \\\"bag-of-words\\\" which is commonly used for differentially weighting key words in tasks like sentiment analyses, and (2) a vector-space model using word2vec (vector-k-mers), that captures semantic and linguistic relationships between words. We built \\\"bag-of-k-mers\\\" and \\\"vector-k-mers\\\" models that distinguish between regulatory and non-regulatory regions with an accuracy above 90%. Our \\\"bag-of-k-mers\\\" achieved higher overall accuracy, while the \\\"vector-k-mers\\\" models were more useful in highlighting key groups of sequences within the regulatory regions. These models now provide powerful tools to annotate regulatory regions in other maize lines beyond the reference, at low cost and with high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Robust quantification of immune cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment may shed light on why only a small proportion of patients benefit from checkpoint therapy. The immune cells surrounding a tumor have been suggested to mediate an effective response to immunotherapy. However, traditional measurement of immune cell content around a tumor by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, or mass cytometry allows measurement of only up to a few dozen markers at a time, limiting the number of immune cell types identified. Immune cell type abundances may instead be estimated in silico by deconvolving gene expression mixtures from bulk RNA sequencing of tumor tissue. By measuring tens of thousands of transcripts at once, bulk RNA-seq provides a rich input to algorithms that quantify cell type abundances in the tumor microenvironment, affording the potential to quantify the states of a greater number of immune cell types (given adequate training data). Here, we first review existing methods for deconvolution and evaluate their performance on synthetic mixtures. Then we develop a Bayesian inference approach, named infino, that learns to distinguish immune cell expression phenotypes and deconvolve mixtures. In contrast to earlier approaches, infino accepts RNA sequencing data, models transcript expression variability, and exploits the relationships between cell types to improve deconvolution accuracy and allow interrogation from the level of broad categories to the level of finest granularity. The resulting probability distributions of immune infiltration could be applied to numerous questions concerning the diverse ecology of immune cell types, including assessment of the association of immune infiltration with response to immunotherapy, and study of the expression profile and presence of elusive T cell subcompartments, such as T cell exhaustion.",

The equilibrium distribution of gene frequencies in structured populations is known since the 1930s, under Wrights metapopulation model known as the island model. The equivalent distribution for the species frequency (i.e. the species proportional abundance distribution (SPAD), at the metacommunity level, however, is unknown. In this contribution, we develop a stochastic model to analytically account for this distribution (SPAD). We show that the same as for genes SPAD follows a beta distribution, which provides a good description of empirical data and applies across a continuum of scales. This stochastic model, based upon a diffusion approximation, provides an alternative to neutral models for the species abundance distribution (SAD), which focus on number of individuals instead of proportions, and demonstrate that the relative frequency of genes in local populations and of species within communities follow the same probability law. We hope our contribution will help stimulate the mathematical and conceptual integration of theories in genetics and ecology.",

    "abstract": "Controversy surrounds the molecular identity of mitochondrial K+ channels that are important for protection against cardiac ischemia-reperfusion injury. While KNa1.2 (Kcnt2 gene) is necessary for cardioprotection by volatile anesthetics, electrophysiologic evidence for a channel of this type in mitochondria is lacking. The endogenous physiologic role of a potential mito-KNa1.2 channel is also unclear. Herein, single channel patch-clamp of 27 independent cardiac mitochondrial inner membrane (mitoplast) preparations from wild type (WT) mice yielded 6 channels matching the known ion-sensitivity, ion-selectivity, pharmacology and conductance properties of KNa1.2 (slope conductance 138{+/-}1 pS). However, similar experiments on 40 preparations from Kcnt2-/- mice yielded zero such channels. The KNa opener bithionol uncoupled respiration in WT but not Kcnt2-/- cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, when oxidizing only fat as substrate, Kcnt2-/- cardiomyocytes and hearts were less responsive to increases in energetic demand. Kcnt2-/- mice also had elevated body fat, but no baseline differences in the cardiac metabolome. These data support the existence of a cardiac mitochondrial KNa1.2 channel, and a role for cardiac KNa1.2 in regulating metabolism under conditions of high energetic demand.",

Analysis of 167 RNA samples from the right atrium revealed that the splice donor mutation in RPL3L results in exon skipping. AF is the first disease associated with RPL3L and RPL3L is the first ribosomal gene implicated in AF. This finding is consistent with tissue specialization of ribosomal function. We also found an association with a missense variant in MYZAP (OR=1.37), encoding a component of the intercalated discs of cardiomyocytes, the organelle harbouring most of the mutated proteins involved in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy.

    "abstract": "Configural face processing is considered to be vital for face perception. If configural face processing requires an evaluation of spatial information, might this process involve interactions between ventral stream face-processing regions and dorsal stream visuospatial-processing regions? We explored this possibility using thetaburst stimulation (TBS) with fMRI in humans. Participants were shown two faces that differed in either the shape (featural differences) or the spatial configuration (configural differences) of their features. TBS applied on dorsal location-processing regions: 1) reduced fMRI activity within ventral stream face-processing regions during configural but not featural face processing; and 2) reduced functional connectivity between these face regions significantly more for configural than featural face processing. No changes occurred when TBS was delivered on the vertex control site for either face task. We conclude that ventral stream face-processing regions receive visuospatial information from dorsal stream location-processing regions during configural face processing.\\n\\nSignificance statementFace perception is thought to be mediated exclusively by neural substrates within the ventral visual pathway. However, by using non-invasive brain stimulation (thetabust transcranial magnetic stimulation) in healthy human adults, we demonstrate that the face-processing regions of the ventral visual pathway receive information from visuospatial-processing regions of the dorsal visual pathway during configural face processing, a vital function in face perception. Our findings thus indicate that veridical face perception may depend on both the ventral and dorsal visual pathways.",

    "abstract": "Generalization during aversive decision-making allows us to avoid a broad range of potential threats following experience with a limited set of exemplars. However, over-generalization, resulting in excessive and inappropriate avoidance, has been implicated in a variety of psychological disorders. Here, we use reinforcement learning modelling to dissect out different contributions to the generalization of instrumental avoidance in two groups of human volunteers (N=26, N=482). We found that generalization of avoidance could be parsed into perceptual and value-based processes, and further, that value-based generalization could be subdivided into that relating to aversive and neutral feedback - with corresponding circuits including primary sensory cortex, anterior insula, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, respectively. Further, generalization from aversive, but not neutral, feedback was associated with self-reported anxiety and intrusive thoughts. These results reveal a set of distinct mechanisms that mediate generalization in avoidance learning, and show how specific individual differences within them can yield anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Hundreds of genes are mutated in non-syndromic intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), with each gene often involved in only a handful of cases. Such heterogeneity can be daunting, but rare recessive loss of function (LOF) mutations can be a good starting point to provide insight into the mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disease. Biallelic LOF mutations in the signaling scaffold CC2D1A cause a rare form of autosomal recessive ID, sometimes associated with ASD and seizures. In parallel, we recently reported that Cc2d1a-deficient mice present with cognitive and social deficits, hyperactivity and anxiety. In Drosophila loss of the only ortholog of Cc2d1a, lgd, is embryonic lethal, while in vertebrates Cc2d1a has a homolog Cc2d1b which appears to be compensating, indicating that Cc2d1a and Cc2d1b have redundant function in humans and mice. Here, we generate an allelic series of Cc2d1a and Cc2d1b loss of function to determine the relative role of these genes during behavioral development. We generated Cc2d1b knockout (KO), Cc2d1a/1b double heterozygous and double KO mice, then performed behavioral studies to analyze learning and memory, social interactions, anxiety, and hyperactivity. We found that Cc2d1a and Cc2d1b have partially overlapping roles. Overall, loss of Cc2d1b is less severe than loss of Cc2d1a, only leading to cognitive deficits, while Cc2d1a/1b double heterozygous animals are similar to Cc2d1a-deficient mice. These results will help us better understand the deficits in individuals with CC2D1A mutations, suggesting that recessive CC2D1B mutations and trans-heterozygous CC2D1A and CC2D1B mutations could also contribute to the genetics of ID.",
