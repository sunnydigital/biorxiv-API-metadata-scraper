    "abstract": "Harmful mutations are ubiquitous and inevitable, and the rate at which these mutations are removed from populations is a critical determinant of evolutionary fate. Closely related sexual and asexual taxa provide a particularly powerful setting to study deleterious mutation elimination because sexual reproduction should facilitate mutational clearance by reducing selective interference between sites and by allowing the production of offspring with different mutational complements than their parents. Here, we compared the rate of removal of conservative (i.e., similar biochemical properties) and radical (i.e., distinct biochemical properties) nonsynonymous mutations from mitochondrial genomes of sexual vs. asexual Potamopyrgus antipodarum, a New Zealand freshwater snail characterized by coexisting and ecologically similar sexual and asexual lineages. Our analyses revealed that radical nonsynonymous mutations are cleared at higher rates than conservative changes and that sexual lineages eliminate radical changes more rapidly than asexual counterparts. These results are consistent with reduced efficacy of purifying selection in asexual lineages allowing harmful mutations to remain polymorphic longer than in sexual lineages. Together, these data illuminate some of the population-level processes contributing to mitochondrial mutation accumulation and suggest that mutation accumulation could influence the outcome of competition between sexual and asexual lineages.",

    "abstract": "Accurately evaluating the distribution of genetic ancestry across geographic space is one of the main questions addressed by evolutionary biologists. This question has been commonly addressed through the application of Bayesian estimation programs allowing their users to estimate individual admixture proportions and allele frequencies among putative ancestral populations. Following the explosion of high-throughput sequencing technologies, several algorithms have been proposed to cope with computational burden generated by the massive data in those studies. In this context, incorporating geographic proximity in ancestry estimation algorithms is an open statistical and computational challenge. In this study, we introduce new algorithms that use geographic information to estimate ancestry proportions and ancestral genotype frequencies from population genetic data. Our algorithms combine matrix factorization methods and spatial statistics to provide estimates of ancestry matrices based on least-squares approximation. We demonstrate the benefit of using spatial algorithms through extensive computer simulations, and we provide an example of application of our new algorithms to a set of spatially referenced samples for the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Without loss of statistical accuracy, the new algorithms exhibit runtimes that are much shorter than those observed for previously developed spatial methods. Our algorithms are implemented in the R package, tess3r.",

    "abstract": "A frequent event in the evolution of prokaryotic genomes is homologous recombination, where a foreign DNA stretch replaces a genomic region similar in sequence. Recombination can affect the relative position of two genomes in a phylogenetic reconstruction in two different ways: (i) one genome can recombine with a DNA stretch that is similar to the other genome, thereby reducing their pairwise sequence divergence; (ii) one genome can recombine with a DNA stretch from an outgroup genome, increasing the pairwise divergence. While several recombination-aware phylogenetic algorithms exist, many of these cannot account for both types of recombination; some algorithms can, but do so inefficiently. Moreover, many existing algorithms require that a substantial portion of each genome has not been affected by recombination, a sometimes unrealistic assumption. Here, we propose a novel coarse-graining approach for phylogenetic reconstruction (CGP), which is recombination-aware, applicable even if all genomic regions have experienced substantial amounts of recombination, and can be used on both nucleotide and amino acid sequences. CGP considers the local density of substitutions along pairwise genome alignments, fitting a model to the empirical distribution of substitution density to infer the pairwise coalescent time. Given all pairwise coalescent times, CGP reconstructs an ultrametric tree representing vertical inheritance. Based on simulations, we show that the proposed approach can reconstruct ultrametric trees with accurate topology, branch lengths, and root positioning. Applied to a set of E. coli strains, the reconstructed trees are most consistent with gene distributions when inferred from amino acid sequences, a data type that cannot be utilized by many alternative approaches.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn homologous recombination, segments of foreign DNA overwrite similar segments of a prokaryotic genome. A single recombination event can simultaneously introduce many DNA substitutions. This disturbs phylogenetic signals, making it difficult to reconstruct prokaryotic family trees. While a handful of recombination-aware phylogenetic algorithms have been proposed, most do not take all effects of recombination into account; others rely on the frequently unrealistic assumption that a substantial part of a genome has not been affected by recombination at all. Here, we introduce a novel approach to phylogenetic reconstruction, which estimates the age of the most recent common ancestor of two strains from the density distribution of DNA or amino acid substitutions between their genomes. The proposed phylogenetic tree is the tree most compatible with these age estimates. Based on nucleotide or amino acid sequences, our approach accurately predicts the topology, branch lengths, and root positioning of prokaryotic family trees.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMalignant tumors are typically caused by a conglomeration of genomic aberrations--including point mutations, small insertions, small deletions, and large copy-number variations. In some cases, specific chemotherapies and targeted drug treatments are effective against tumors that harbor certain genomic aberrations. However, predictive aberrations (biomarkers) have not been identified for many tumors. One way to address this problem is to examine the downstream, transcriptional effects of genomic aberrations and to identify characteristic patterns. Even though two tumors harbor different genomic aberrations, the transcriptional effects of those aberrations may be similar. These patterns could be used to inform treatment choices.\\n\\nResultsWe hypothesized that by grouping genomic aberrations according to their downstream transcriptional effects, we could identify drug-repurposing candidates that coincide with prior knowledge. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a computational pipeline that uses supervised machine learning to identify similarities among mutually exclusive genomic aberrations based on their transcriptional effects. We used data from 9300 tumors across 25 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas to evaluate our approach. Our pipeline recapitulates known relationships in cancer pathways, and it identifies gene pairs known to predict responses to the same treatments.\\n\\nConclusionWe show that transcriptional data offer promise as a way to group genomic aberrations according to their downstream effects, and these groupings recapitulate known relationships. Our approach shows potential to help pharmacologists and clinical trialists narrow the search space for candidate gene/drug associations, including for rare mutations, and for identifying potential drug-repurposing opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Lateral gene transfers between ancient species contain information about the relative timing of species diversification. Specifically, the ancestors of a donor species must have existed before the descendants of the recipient species. Hence, the detection of a transfer event can be translated into a time constraint between nodes of a phylogeny if the donor and recipient can be identified. When a set of transfers is detected by interpreting the phylogenetic discordance between gene trees and a species tree, the set of all deduced time constraints can be used to rank the species tree, i.e. order totally its internal nodes. Unfortunately lateral gene transfer detection is challenging and current methods produce a significant proportion of false positives. As a result, often, no ranking of the species tree is compatible with the full set of time constraints deduced from predicted transfers. Here we propose a method, implemented in a software called MaxTiC (Maximum Time Consistency), which takes as input a species tree and a series of (possibly inconsistent) time constraints between its internal nodes, weighted by confidence scores. MaxTiC outputs a ranked species tree compatible with a subset of constraints with maximum cumulated confidence score. We extensively test the method on simulated datasets, under a wide range of conditions that we compare to measures on biological datasets. In most conditions the obtained ranked tree is very close to the real one, confirming the potential of dating the history of life with transfers by maximizing time consistency. MaxTiC is freely available, distributed along with a documentation and several examples: https://github.com/ssolo/ALE/tree/master/maxtic.",

    "abstract": "Throughout an animals postembryonic development, neuronal circuits must maintain appropriate output even as the body grows. The contribution of structural adaptation -- neuronal morphology and synaptic connectivity -- to circuit development remains unclear. In a previous paper (Schneider-Mizell et al., 2016), we measured the detailed neuronal morphological structures subserving neuronal connectivity in Drosophila. Here, we examine how neuronal morphology and connectivity change across postembyronic development. Using new and existing serial section electron microscopy volumes, we reconstructed an identified nociceptive circuit in two larvae, one 1st instar and one 3rd instar. We found extremely consistent, topographically-arranged circuit structure. Five-fold increases in size of interneurons were associated with compensatory structural changes that maintained cell-type-specific synaptic input as a fraction of total inputs. An increase in number of synaptic contacts was accompanied with a disproportionate increase in the number of small dendritic terminal branches relative to other neuronal compartments. We propose that these precise patterns of structural growth act to conserve the computational function of a circuit, for example determining the location of a nociceptive stimulus.",

We applied a systems-pharmacology approach by integrating network-based analyses with multiple bioinformatic resources to design a drug combination regimen reversing EMT phenotype in aggressive cancers. We observed that histone deacetylases were critical targets to tune expression of multiple epithelial versus mesenchymal genes. Moreover, SRC and IKBK were the principal intracellular kinases regulating multiple signaling pathways. To validate the anti-EMT efficacy of the target combinations, we inhibited the pinpointed proteins with already prescribed drugs and observed that whereas low dose mono-therapy failed to limit cell dispersion from collagen spheroids in a microfluidic device as a metric of EMT, the combination fully inhibited dissociation and invasion of cancer cells toward co-cultured endothelial cells. Given the approval status and safety profiles of the suggested drugs, the proposed combination set can be considered in clinical trials.",

These mechanisms have the net effect of generating tractions (force per unit length) on the bilayer that are translated into distinct shapes of the membrane. Here, we demonstrate how the local shape of the membrane can be used to infer the traction acting locally on the membrane. We show that buds and tubes, two common membrane deformations studied in trafficking processes, have different traction distributions along the membrane and that these tractions are specific to the molecular mechanism used to generate these shapes. Furthermore, we show that the magnitude of an axial force applied to the membrane as well as that of an effective line tension can be calculated from these tractions. Finally, we consider the sensitivity of these quantities with respect to uncertainties in material properties and follow with a discussion on sources of uncertainty in membrane shape.",

Recently, Leuenberger et al. developed an elegant experimental approach to measure protein thermal stability at the proteome scale. The collected data allow us to rigorously test the predictions of the misfolding avoidance hypothesis that highly expressed proteins have evolved to be more stable, and that maintaining thermodynamic stability significantly constrains their evolution. Notably, careful re-analysis of the Leuenberger et al. data across four different organisms reveals no substantial correlation between protein stability and protein abundance. Therefore, the key predictions of the misfolding toxicity and related hypotheses are not supported by available empirical data. The data also suggest that, regardless of protein expression, protein stability does not substantially affect the protein molecular clock across organisms.",

    "abstract": "We report the first DNA amplification chemistry with switch-like characteristics: the chemistry is biphasic, with an expected initial phase followed by an unprecedented high gain burst of product oligonucleotide in a second phase. The first and second phases are separated by a temporary plateau, with the second phase producing 10 to 100 times more product than the first. The reaction is initiated when an oligonucleotide binds and opens a palindromic looped DNA template with two binding domains. Upon loop opening, the oligonucleotide trigger is rapidly amplified through cyclic extension and nicking of the bound trigger. Loop opening and DNA association drive the amplification reaction, such that reaction acceleration in the second phase is correlated with DNA association thermodynamics. Without a palindromic sequence, the chemistry resembles the exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR). EXPAR terminates at the initial plateau, revealing a previously unknown phenomenon that causes early reaction cessation in this popular oligonucleotide amplification reaction. Here we present two distinct types of this biphasic reaction chemistry and propose dominant reaction pathways for each type based on thermodynamic arguments. These reactions create an endogenous switch-like output that reacts to approximately 1pM oligonucleotide trigger. The chemistry is isothermal and can be adapted to respond to a broad range of input target molecules such as proteins, genomic bacterial DNA, viral DNA, and microRNA. This rapid DNA amplification reaction could potentially impact a variety of disciplines such as synthetic biology, biosensors, DNA computing, and clinical diagnostics.",

Although much is known about ER gene (ESR1) regulation after hormonal stimulation, how it is regulated in hormone-free condition is not fully understood. We used ER-/PR-positive breast cancer cells to investigate the role of PR in ESR1 regulation in the absence of hormones. We show that PR binds to the low-methylated ESR1 promoter and maintains both gene expression and DNA methylation of the ESR1 locus in hormone-deprived breast cancer cells. Depletion of PR reduces ESR1 expression, with a concomitant increase in gene promoter methylation. The high amount of methylation in the ESR1 promoter of PR-depleted cells persists after the stable re-expression of PR and inhibits PR binding to this genomic region. As a consequence, the rescue of PR expression in PR-depleted cells is insufficient to restore ESR1 expression. Consistently, DNA methylation impedes PR binding to consensus progesterone responsive elements. These findings contribute to understanding the complex crosstalk between PR and ER and suggest that the analysis of ESR1 promoter methylation in breast cancer cells can help to design more appropriate targeted therapies for breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "In daily interactions, our sensorimotor system accounts for spatial and temporal discrepancies between the senses. Functional lateralization between hemispheres causes differences in attention and control of action. In addition, differences in transmission delays between modalities affects motor control. Studies on hemispatial neglect syndrome suggest a link between temporal processing and lateral spatial biases. To understand this link, we studied participants who performed lateral reaching, and adapted to delayed visual feedback in either left, right, or both workspaces. We tested transfer of adaptation to blind drawing, and found that adaptation to left or both delay caused selective leftward elongation. In contrast, adaptation to right delay caused elongation in both directions. Arm dynamics alone cannot explain these findings, but a model of a combined attentional-motor asymmetry across the hemispheres explains our observations. This suggests a possible connection between laterality in delay processing and motor performances observed in cases of hemispatial neglect.",

    "abstract": "The progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with marked alterations in circulating immune cell populations, but no studies have characterized alterations in these cell types across the full spectrum of lung function impairment in current and former smokers. In 6,299 subjects from the COPDGene and ECLIPSE studies, we related Coulter blood counts and proportions to cross-sectional FEV1 adjusting for current smoking status. We also related cell count measures to three-year change in FEV1 in ECLIPSE subjects. In a subset of subjects with blood gene expression data, we used cell type deconvolution methods to infer the proportions of immune cell subpopulations, and we related these to COPD clinical status. We observed that FEV1 levels are positively correlated with lymphocytes and negatively correlated with myeloid populations such as neutrophils and monocytes. In multivariate models, absolute cell counts and proportions were associated with cross-sectional FEV1, and lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophil counts were predictive of three-year change in lung function. Using cell type deconvolution to study immune cell subpopulations, we observed that subjects with COPD had a lower proportion of CD4+ resting memory cells and naive B cells compared to non-COPD smokers. Alterations in circulating immune cells in COPD support a mixed pattern of lymphocyte suppression and an enhanced myeloid cell immune response. Cell counts and proportions contribute independent information to models predicting lung function suggesting a critical role for immune response in long-term COPD outcomes. Cell type deconvolution is a promising method for immunophenotyping in large cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Mate preferences and mating-related behaviors are hypothesized to change over the menstrual cycle in ways that function to increase reproductive fitness. Results of recent large-scale studies suggest that many of these hormone-linked behavioral changes are less robust than was previously thought. One hypothesis that has not yet been subject to a large-scale test is the proposal that womens preference for associating with male kin is down-regulated during the ovulatory (high-fertility) phase of the menstrual cycle. Consequently, we used a longitudinal design to investigate the relationship between changes in womens steroid hormone levels and their perceptions of faces experimentally manipulated to possess kinship cues. Analyses suggested that women viewed mens faces displaying kinship cues more positively (i.e., more attractive and trustworthy) when estradiol-to-progesterone ratio was high. Since estradiol-to-progesterone ratio is positively associated with conception risk during the menstrual cycle, these results directly contradict the hypothesis that womens preference for associating with male kin is down-regulated during the ovulatory (high-fertility) phase of the menstrual cycle.

    "abstract": "B cells play a major role in the adaptive immune response by producing antigen-specific antibodies against pathogens and imparting immunological memory. Following infection or vaccination, antibody-secreting B cells and memory B cells are generated in specialized regions of lymph nodes and spleens, called germinal centers. Here, we report a fully synthetic ex-vivo system that recapitulates the generation of antigen-specific germinal-center (GC) like B cells using material-surface driven polyvalent signaling. This synthetic germinal center (sGC) reaction was effectively induced using biomaterial-based artificial \\\"follicular T helper cells (TFH)\\\" that provided both natural CD40-CD40L ligation as well as crosslinking of CD40; and by mimicking artificial \\\"follicular dendritic cells (FDC)\\\" to provide efficient, polyvalent antigen presentation. The artificial sGC reaction resulted in efficient B cell expansion, immunoglobulin (Ig) class switching, and expression of germinal center phenotypes. Antigen presentation during sGC reaction selectively enhanced the antigen-specific B cell population and induced somatic hyper-mutations for potential affinity maturation. The resulting B cell population consisted primarily of GC-like B cells (centrocytes) as well as some plasma-like B cells expressing CD138. With concurrent cell sorting, we successfully created highly enriched populations of antigen-specific B cells. Adoptive transfer of these GC-like B cells into non-irradiated isogeneic or non-lethally irradiated congenic recipient mice showed successful engraftment and survival of the donor cells for the 4 week test period. We show that this material-surface driven sGC reaction can be successfully applied to not only splenic B cells but also B cells isolated from more therapeutically relevant sources such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), thus making our current work an exciting prospect in the new era of personalized medicine and custom-immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC provides an efficient platform for profiling DNA methylation in humans at over 850,000 CpGs. Model organisms such as mice do not currently benefit from an equivalent array. Here we used this array to measure DNA methylation in mice. We defined probes targeting conserved regions and performed a comparison between the array-based assay and affinity-based DNA sequencing of methyl-CpGs (MBD-seq). Mouse samples consisted of 11 liver DNA from two strains, C57BL/6J (B6) and DBA/2J (D2), that varied widely in age. Linear regression was applied to detect differential methylation. In total, 13,665 probes (1.6% of total probes) aligned to conserved CpGs. Beta-values ({beta}-value) for these probes showed a distribution similar to that in humans. Overall, there was high concordance in methylation signal between the EPIC array and MBD-seq (Pearson correlation r = 0.70, p-value < 0.0001). However, the EPIC probes had higher quantitative sensitivity at CpGs that are hypo-({beta}-value < 0.3) or hypermethylated ({beta}-value > 0.7). In terms of differential methylation, no EPIC probe detected significant difference between age groups at a Benjamini-Hochberg threshold of 10%, and the MBD-seq performed better at detecting age-dependent change in methylation. However, the top most significant probe for age (cg13269407; uncorrected p-value = 1.8 x 10-5) is part of the clock CpGs used to estimate the human epigenetic age. For strain, 219 Infinium probes detected significant differential methylation (FDR cutoff 10%) with [~]80% CpGs associated with higher methylation in D2. This higher methylation profile in D2 compared to B6 was also replicated by the MBD-seq data. To summarize, we found only a small subset of EPIC probes that target conserved sites. However, for this small subset the array provides areliable assay of DNA methylation and can be effectively used to measure differential methylation in mice.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation of dinucleotide CpG is an essential epigenetic modification that plays a key role in transcription. Bisulfite conversion method is a \\\"gold standard\\\" for DNA methylation profiling that provides single nucleotide resolution. However, whole-genome bisulfite conversion is very expensive. Alternatively, DNA enrichment-based methods offer high coverage of methylated CpG dinucleotides with the lowest cost per CpG covered genome-wide and have been used widely. They measure the DNA enrichment of methyl-CpG binding, therefore do not directly provide absolute methylation levels. Further, the enrichment is influenced by confounding factors besides the methylation status, e.g., CpG density. Computational models that can accurately derive the absolute methylation levels from the enrichment data are necessary.\\n\\nResultsWe present  MeDEStrand, a method uses sigmoid function to estimate and correct the CpG bias from the numbers of reads that fell within bins that divide the genome. In addition, unlike the previous methods, which estimate CpG bias based on reads mapped at the same genomic loci,  MeDEStrand processes the reads for the positive and negative DNA strands separately. We compare the performance of  MeDEStrand with three other state-of-the-art methods  MEDIPS,  BayMeth and  QSEA on four independent datasets generated using immortalized cell lines (GM12878 and K562) and human patient primary cells (foreskin fibroblast and mammary epithelial). Based on the comparison between the inferred absolute methylation levels from MeDIP-seq and the corresponding RRBS data,  MeDEStrand shows the best performance at high resolution of 25, 50 and 100 base pairs.\\n\\nConclusions MeDEStrand benefits from the estimation of CpG bias with a sigmoid function and the procedure to process reads mapped to the positive and negative DNA strands separately.  MeDEStrand is a tool to infer whole-genome absolute DNA methylation level at the cost of enrichment-based methods with adequate accuracy and resolution.

    "abstract": "RNAs present in mature mammalian sperm are delivered to the zygote at fertilization, where they have the potential to affect early development. The biogenesis of the small RNA payload of mature sperm is therefore of great interest, as it may be a target of signaling pathways linking paternal conditions to offspring phenotype. Recent studies have suggested the surprising hypothesis that the small RNA payload carried by mature sperm may include RNAs that were not synthesized during testicular spermatogenesis, but that are instead delivered to sperm during the process of post-testicular maturation in the epididymis. To further test this hypothesis, we characterized small RNA dynamics during testicular and post-testicular germ cell maturation in mice. We show that purified testicular germ cell populations, including mature testicular spermatozoa, carry extremely low levels of tRNA fragments (tRFs), and that tRFs become highly abundant only after sperm have entered the epididiymis. The process of small RNA delivery to sperm can be recapitulated in vitro, as caput epididymosomes deliver small RNAs including tRFs and microRNAs to mature testicular spermatozoa. Finally, to definitively identify the tissue of origin for small RNAs in sperm, we carried out tissue-specific metabolic labeling of RNAs in intact mice, finding that mature sperm carry small RNAs that were originally synthesized in the somatic cells of the epididymis. Taken together, our data demonstrates that soma-germline small RNA transfer occurs in male mammals, most likely via vesicular transport from the epididymis to maturing sperm.",

However, high-throughput experimental validation of their function and high-resolution dissection of their driver nucleotides remain limited in their scale and length of regions tested. Here, we present a new method, HiDRA (High-Definition Reporter Assay), that overcomes these limitations by combining components of Sharpr-MPRA2 and STARR-Seq3 with genome-wide selection of accessible regions from ATAC-Seq4. We used HiDRA to test ~7 million DNA fragments preferentially selected from accessible chromatin in the GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line. By design, accessibility-selected fragments were highly overlapping (up to 370 per region), enabling us to pinpoint driver regulatory nucleotides by exploiting subtle differences in reporter activity between partially-overlapping fragments, using a new machine learning model SHARPR2. Our resulting maps include ~65,000 regions showing significant enhancer function and enriched for endogenous active histone marks (including H3K9ac, H3K27ac), regulatory sequence motifs, and regions bound by immune regulators. Within them, we discover ~13,000 high-resolution driver elements enriched for regulatory motifs and evolutionarily-conservednucleotides, and help predict causal genetic variants underlying disease from genome-wide association studies. Overall, HiDRA provides a general, scalable, high-throughput, and high-resolution approach for experimental dissection of regulatory regions and driver nucleotides in the context of human biology and disease.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionLatency reversal agents (LRAs), such as protein kinase C (PKC) agonists, constitute a promising strategy for exposing and eliminating the HIV-1 latent reservoir. PKC agonists activate NF-{kappa}B and, in turn, induce deleterious pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Adjuvant pharmacological agents, such as ruxolitinib, a JAK inhibitor, and rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, have previously been combined with LRAs to reduce deleterious pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion without inhibiting HIV-1 viral reactivation in vitro. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are known to dampen pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in the context of other diseases and can synergize with other LRAs to bring dormant proviruses out of latency. In this study we investigated whether a broad panel of epigenetic modifiers, including HDACi, could effectively dampen PKC-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion during latency reversal.\n\nMethodsWe screened an epigenetic modifier library to identify compounds that reduced intracellular IL-6 production induced by the PKC agonist Ingenol-3,20-dibenzoate. We further tested the most promising epigenetic inhibitor class, HDACi, for their ability to reduce a broad panel of pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactivate latent HIV-1 ex vivo.\n\nResultsWe identified nine epigenetic modulators that reduced PKC-induced intracellular IL-6. In cells from aviremic individuals living with HIV-1, the HDAC1-3 inhibitor, suberohydroxamic acid (SBHA), reduced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-, IL-5, IL-2r, and IL-17 but did not significantly reactivate latent HIV-1 when used in combination with Ingenol-3,20-dibenzoate.\n\nConclusionThe addition of SBHA to Ingenol-3,20-dibenzoate reduces deleterious cytokine production during latency reversal but does not induce significant viral reactivation in aviremic donor PBMCs. The ability of SBHA to reduce PKC-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines when used in combination with Ingenol-3,20-dibenzoate suggests that SBHA can be used to reduced PKC induced pro-inflammatory cytokines but not to achieve latency reversal in the context of HIV-1.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt has been suggested that the high phospholipid (PL) requirement in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) fry is due to insufficient intestinal de-novo synthesis causing low lipoprotein (LP) production and reduced transport capacity of dietary lipids. However, there has not been performed any in-depth ontological analysis of intestinal PL and LP synthesis with development of salmon. Therefore in this paper we used RNA-seq technology to test the hypothesis that the high PL requirement in salmon fry was associated with undeveloped PL synthesis and LP formation pathways in intestine. There was a special focus on the understanding homologous genes, especially from salmonid-specific fourth vertebrate whole-genome duplication (Ss4R), contribution to salmonid specific features of regulation of PL metabolic pathways. The study was performed in stomach, pyloric caeca and hindgut at 0.16g (1 day before first-feeding), 2.5g and 10g of salmon.\\n\\nResultsIn general, we found an up-regulation of de-novo phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) synthesis, phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) and LP formation pathways in pyloric caeca of salmon between 0.16g and 10g. Thirteen genes in these pathways were highly (q<0.05) up-regulated in 2.5g salmon compared to 0.16g, while only five more significant (q<0.05) genes were found when the fish grew up to 10g. Different homologous genes were found dominating in stomach, pyloric caeca and hindgut. However, the expression of dominating genes in PL and LP synthesis pathways was much higher in pyloric caeca than stomach and hindgut. Salmon-specific homologous (Ss4R) genes had similar expression during development, while other homologs had more diverged expression.\\n\\nConclusionsAn increasing capacity for PL synthesis and LP formation was confirmed in pyloric caeca. The up-regulation of the de-novo PtdCho pathway confirms that the salmon fry have increasing requirement for dietary PtdCho compared to adult. The similar expressions between Ss4R homologous genes suggest that the functional divergence of these genes was incomplete compared to homologs derived from other whole genome duplication. The results of the present study have provided new information on the molecular mechanisms of phospholipid synthesis and lipoprotein formation in fish.",

    "abstract": "Associative fear learning produces fear toward the conditioned stimulus (CS) and often generalization, the expansion of fear from the CS to similar, unlearned stimuli. However, how fear learning affects early sensory processing of learned and unlearned stimuli in relation to behavioral fear responses to these stimuli remains unclear. We subjected mice to a classical olfactory fear conditioning paradigm and used awake, in vivo calcium imaging to quantify learning-induced changes in glomerular odor responses, which constitutes the first site of olfactory processing in the brain. The results demonstrate that olfactory fear learning non-specifically enhances glomerular odor representations in a learning-dependent manner and increases representational similarity between the CS and non-conditioned odors. This mechanism may prime the system towards generalization of learned fear. Additionally, CS-specific enhancements remain even when associative learning is blocked; suggesting two separate mechanisms lead to enhanced glomerular responses following odor-shock pairings.",

    "abstract": "Switching systems are common in artificial control systems. Here, we suggest that the brain adopts a switched feedforward control of grip forces during manipulation of objects. We measured how participants modulated grip force when interacting with soft and rigid virtual springs when stiffness varied nearly continuously between trials. We identified a sudden phase transition between two forms of feedforward control that differed in the timing of the synchronization between the anticipated load force and the applied grip force. The switch occurred several trials after a threshold stiffness level. These results suggest that in the control of grip force, the brain acts as a switching control system. This opens new research questions as to the nature of the discrete state variables that drive the switching.",

    "abstract": "Musical rhythm and the grammatical structure of language share a surprising number of characteristics that may be intrinsically related in child development. The present study aimed to understand the potential influence of musical rhythmic priming on subsequent spoken grammar task performance in children with typical development who were native speakers of English. Participants (ages 5 to 8 years) listened to rhythmically regular and irregular musical sequences (within-subjects design) followed by blocks of grammatically correct and incorrect sentences upon which they were asked to perform a grammaticality judgment task. Rhythmically regular musical sequences improved performance in grammaticality judgment compared to rhythmically irregular musical sequences. No such effect of rhythmic priming was found in two non-linguistic control tasks, suggesting a neural overlap between rhythm processing and mechanisms recruited during grammar processing. These findings build on previous research investigating the effect of rhythmic priming by extending the paradigm to a different language, testing a younger population, and employing non-language control tasks. These findings of an immediate influence of rhythm on grammar states (temporarily augmented grammaticality judgment performance) also converge with previous findings of associations between rhythm and grammar traits (stable, generalized grammar abilities) in children. Taken together, this study provides additional evidence for shared neural processing for language and music, and warrants future investigations of potentially beneficial effects of innovative musical material on language processing.",

    "abstract": "Brittle stars (Ophiuroidea, Echinodermata) have been increasingly used in studies of animal behavior, locomotion, regeneration, physiology, and bioluminescence. The success of these studies directly depends on good working knowledge of ophiuroid nervous system. Here, we describe the arm nervous system at different levels of organization: microanatomy of the radial nerve cord and peripheral nerves, neural ultrastructure, and localization of different cell types using specific antibody markers. We standardize the nomenclature of nerves and ganglia and provide an anatomically accurate digital 3D model of the arm nervous system as a reference for future studies. Our results helped identify several general features characteristic to the adult echinoderm nervous system, including the extensive anatomical interconnections between the ectoneural and hyponeural components and neuroepithelial organization of the central nervous system with its supporting scaffold formed by radial glial cells. In addition, we provide further support to the notion that the echinoderm radial glia is a complex and diverse cell population. We also tested the suitability of a range of specific cell-type markers for studies of the brittle star nervous system and established that the radial glial cells are reliably labeled by the ERG1 antibodies, whereas the best neuronal markers are acetylated tubulin, ELAV and synaptotagmin B. The transcription factor Brn1/2/4, a marker of neuronal progenitors, is expressed not only in neurons, but also in a subpopulation of radial glia. For the first time, we describe putative ophiuroid proprioceptors associated with the hyponeural part of the central nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Temporal fluctuations in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) have been profitably used to study brain activity and connectivity for over two decades. Unfortunately, fMRI data also contain structured temporal \\\"noise\\\" from a variety of sources, including subject motion, subject physiology, and the MRI equipment. Recently, methods have been developed to automatically and selectively remove spatially specific structured noise from fMRI data using spatial Independent Components Analysis (ICA) and machine learning classifiers. Spatial ICA is particularly effective at removing spatially specific structured noise from high temporal and spatial resolution fMRI data of the type acquired by the Human Connectome Project and similar studies. However, spatial ICA is mathematically, by design, unable to separate spatially widespread \\\"global\\\" structured noise from fMRI data (e.g., blood flow modulations from subject respiration). No methods currently exist to selectively and completely remove global structured noise while retaining the global signal from neural activity. This has left the field in a quandary--to do or not to do global signal regression--given that both choices have substantial downsides. Here we show that temporal ICA can selectively segregate and remove global structured noise while retaining global neural signal in both task-based and resting state fMRI data. We compare the results before and after temporal ICA cleanup to those from global signal regression and show that temporal ICA cleanup removes the global positive biases caused by global physiological noise without inducing the network-specific negative biases of global signal regression. We believe that temporal ICA cleanup provides a \\\"best of both worlds\\\" solution to the global signal and global noise dilemma and that temporal ICA itself unlocks interesting neurobiological insights from fMRI data.",

    "abstract": "Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants that remain a human health concern with the discovery of new sources of contamination and ongoing bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Children exposed during early brain development are at highest risk of neurological deficits, but there is some evidence that high PCB exposure in adults increases the risk of Parkinsons disease. Our previous studies found allelic differences in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor and cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) affect susceptibility to developmental PCB exposure, resulting in cognitive deficits and motor dysfunction. High-affinity AhrbCyp1a2(-/-) mice were most susceptible compared with poor-affinity AhrdCyp1a2(-/-) and wild type AhrbCyp1a2(+/+) mice. Our follow-up studies assessed biochemical, histological and gene expression changes to identify the brain regions and pathways affected. We also measured PCB and metabolite levels in multiple tissues to determine if genotype altered toxicokinetics. We found evidence of AHR-mediated immune suppression with reduced thymus and spleen weights and significantly reduced thyroxine at P14. In the brain, the greatest changes were seen in the cerebellum where a foliation defect was over-represented in Cyp1a2(-/-) mice. In contrast, we found no difference in tyrosine hydroxylase immuno-staining in the striatum. Gene expression patterns varied across the three genotypes, but there was clear evidence of AHR activation. Distribution of parent PCB congeners also varied by genotype with strikingly high levels of PCB 77 in poor-affinity AhrdCyp1a2(-/-) while AhrbCyp1a2(+/+) mice effectively sequestered coplanar PCBs in the liver. Together, our data suggest that the AHR pathway plays a role in developmental PCB neurotoxicity, but we found little evidence that developmental exposure is a risk factor for Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, much technical progress has been done regarding plant phenotyping including the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. With automated, high-throughput platforms and the development of improved algorithms for the rosette segmentation task, it is now possible to massively extract reliable shape and size parameters for genetic, physiological and environmental studies. The development of low-cost phenotyping platforms and freeware resources make it possible to widely expand phenotypic analysis tools for Arabidopsis. However, objective descriptors of shape parameters that could be used independently of platform and segmentation software used are still lacking and shape descriptions still rely on ad hoc or even sometimes contradictory descriptors, which could make comparisons difficult and perhaps inaccurate. Modern geometric morphometrics is a family of methods in quantitative biology proposed to be the main source of data and analytical tools in the emerging field of phenomics studies. It has been used for taxonomists and paleontologists for decades and is now a mature discipline. By combining geometry, multivariate analysis and powerful statistical techniques, it offers the possibility to reproducibly and accurately account for shape variations amongst groups. Based on the location of homologous landmarks points over photographed or scanned specimens, these tools could identify the existence and degree of shape variation and measure them in standard units. Here, it is proposed a particular scheme of landmarks placement on Arabidopsis rosette images to study shape variation in the case study of viral infection processes. Several freeware-based geometric morphometric tools are applied in order to exemplify the usefulness of this approach to the study of phenotypes in this model plant. These methods are concisely presented and explained. Shape differences between controls and infected plants are quantified throughout the infectious process and visualized with the appealing graphs that are a hallmark of these techniques and render complex mathematical analysis simple outcomes to interpret. Quantitative comparisons between two unrelated ssRNA+ viruses are shown and reproducibility issues are assessed. Combined with the newest automatons and plant segmentation procedures, geometric morphometric tools could boost phenotypic features extraction and processing in an objective, reproducible manner.",

In this study, we describe an imaging system that integrates low-cost and open-source hardware, software and genetic resources. The multi-fluorescence imaging system consists of readily available 470 nm LEDs, a Raspberry Pi camera and a set of filters made with low cost acrylics. This device allows imaging in scales ranging from single colonies to entire plates. We developed a set of genetic components (e.g. promoters, coding sequences, terminators) and vectors following the standard framework of Golden Gate, which allowed the fabrication of genetic constructs in a combinatorial, low cost and robust manner. In order to provide simultaneous imaging of multiple wavelength signals, we screened a series of long stokes shift fluorescent proteins that could be combined with cyan/green fluorescent proteins. We found CyOFP1, mBeRFP and sfGFP to be the most compatible set for 3-channel fluorescent imaging. We developed open source Python code to operate the hardware to run time-lapse experiments with automated control of illumination and camera and a Python module to analyze data and extract meaningful biological information. To demonstrate the potential application of this integral system, we tested its performance on a diverse range of imaging assays often used in disciplines such as microbial ecology, microbiology and synthetic biology. We also assessed its potential for STEM teaching in a high school environment, using it to teach biology, hardware design, optics, and programming. Together, these results demonstrate the successful integration of open source hardware, software, genetic resources and customizable manufacturing to obtain a powerful, low cost and robust system for STEM education, scientific research and bioengineering.

    "abstract": "Ongoing developments in myoelectric prosthesis control have provided prosthesis users with an assortment of control strategies that vary in reliability and performance. Many studies have focused on improving performance by providing feedback to the user, but have overlooked the effect of this feedback on internal model development, which is key to improving long-term performance. In this work, the strength of internal models developed for two commonly used myoelectric control strategies: raw control with raw feedback (using a regression-based approach), and filtered control with filtered feedback (using a classifier-based approach), were evaluated using two psychometric measures: trial-by-trial adaptation and just-noticeable-difference. The performance of both strategies was also evaluated using a Schmidts style target acquisition task. Results obtained from 24 able-bodied subjects showed that although filtered control with filtered feedback had better short-term performance in path efficiency (p < 0.05), raw control with raw feedback resulted in stronger internal model development (p < 0.05), which may lead to better long-term performance. Despite inherent noise in the control signals of the regression controller, these findings suggest that rich feedback associated with regression control may be used to improve human understanding of the myoelectric control system.",

Long-term imaging, across development or behavioral states, places further demands on sample mounting with minimal perturbation of the organism. Here we present a simple and inexpensive method for rapid encapsulation of small animals of any developmental stage within a photocrosslinked polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel, gently restricting movement within their confined spaces. Immobilized animals maintained a normal, uncompressed morphology in a hydrated environment and could be exposed to different aqueous chemicals. We focus in particular on the nematode C. elegans, an organism that is typically viewed with paralyzing reagents, nanobeads, adhesives, or microfluidic traps. The hydrogel is optically clear, non-autofluorescent, and nearly index-matched with water for use with light-sheet microscopy. We captured volumetric images of optogenetically-stimulated responses in multiple sensory neurons over 14 hours using a diSPIM light-sheet microscope, and immobilized worms were recoverable and viable after 24 hours encapsulation. We further imaged living pygmy squid hatchlings to demonstrate size scalability, characterized immobilization quality for various crosslinking parameters and identified paralytic-free conditions suitable for high-resolution single cell imaging. PEG hydrogel encapsulation enables continuous observation for hours of small living organisms, from yeast to zebrafish, and is compatible with multiple microscope mounting geometries.",

    "abstract": "We study how the arboreal turtle ant (Cephalotes goniodontus) solves a fundamental computing problem: maintaining a trail network and finding alternative paths to route around broken links in the network. Turtle ants form a routing backbone of foraging trails linking several nests and temporary food sources. This species travels only in the trees, so their foraging trails are constrained to lie on a natural graph formed by overlapping branches and vines in the tangled canopy. Links between branches, however, can be ephemeral, easily destroyed by wind, rain, or animal movements. Here we report a biologically feasible distributed algorithm, parameterized using field data, that can plausibly describe how turtle ants maintain the routing backbone and find alternative paths to circumvent broken links in the backbone. We validate the ability of this probabilistic algorithm to circumvent simulated breaks in synthetic and real-world networks, and we derive an analytic explanation for why certain features are crucial to improve the algorithms success. Our proposed algorithm uses fewer computational resources than common distributed graph search algorithms, and thus may be useful in other domains, such as for swarm computing or for coordinating molecular robots.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular programs that guide cellular differentiation during development is a major goal of modern biology. Here, we introduce an approach, WADDINGTON-OT, based on the mathematics of optimal transport, for inferring developmental landscapes, probabilistic cellular fates and dynamic trajectories from large-scale single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data collected along a time course. We demonstrate the power of WADDINGTON-OT by applying the approach to study 65,781 scRNA-seq profiles collected at 10 time points over 16 days during reprogramming of fibroblasts to iPSCs. We construct a high-resolution map of reprogramming that rediscovers known features; uncovers new alternative cell fates including neuraland placental-like cells; predicts the origin and fate of any cell class; highlights senescent-like cells that may support reprogramming through paracrine signaling; and implicates regulatory models in particular trajectories. Of these findings, we highlight Obox6, which we experimentally show enhances reprogramming efficiency. Our approach provides a general framework for investigating cellular differentiation.",

This study aims to investigate the protection and metabolic modulation role of liraglutide (Lira) on kidney of obesity. Rats were induced obese by high-fat diet (HFD), and renal function and metabolism changes were evaluated by metabolomic, biological and histological methods. HFD rats exhibited metabolic disorders including elevated body weight, hyperlipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance, and remarkable renal injuries including declined renal function and inflammatory/fibrotic changes, whereas Lira significantly ameliorated these adverse effects in HFD rats. Metabolomic data showed that Lira reduced renal lipids including fatty acid residues, cholesterol, phospholipids and triglycerides, and improved mitochondria metabolites such as succinate, citrate, taurine, fumarate and NAD+ in the kidney of HDF rats. Furthermore, we revealed that Lira inhibited renal lipid accumulation by coordinating lipogenic and lipolytic signals, and rescued renal mitochondria function via Sirt1/AMPK/PGC1 pathways in HDF rats. This study suggested that Lira alleviated HFD-induced kidney injury via directly restoring renal lipid and energy metabolism, and GLP-1 receptor agonist is a promising therapy for obesity-associated CKD.",

According to the proposed mechanism, ESCRT-III proteins drive membrane fission by assembling into helical filaments on membranes. Yet, ESCRT-III filaments have never been directly visualized in a cellular process that utilizes this machinery for its function. Here we used 3D STORM imaging of endogenous ESCRT-III component IST1, to describe the structural organization of ESCRT-III during mammalian cytokinetic abscission. Using this approach, ESCRT-III ring and spiral assemblies were resolved at the intercellular tube of cells undergoing abscission. Characterization of these structures indicates the ESCRT-III helical filament undergoes remodeling during abscission. This work provides the first evidence that ESCRT-III proteins assemble into helical filaments in physiological context, indicating that the ESCRT-III machine indeed derives its contractile activity through spiral assemblies. Moreover, it provides new structural information on ESCRT-III filaments, which raise new mechanistic scenarios for ESCRT driven membrane constriction.",

    "abstract": "O_LIBinomial N-mixture models are commonly applied to analyze population survey data. By estimating detection probabilities, N-mixture models aim at extracting information about abundances in terms of actual and not just relative numbers. This separation of detection probability and abundance relies on parametric assumptions about the distribution of individuals among sites and of detections of individuals among repeat visits to sites. Current methods for checking assumptions are limited, and their computational complexity have hindered evaluations of their performances.\\nC_LIO_LIWe develop computationally efficient graphical goodness of fit checks and measures of overdispersion for binomial N-mixture models. These checks are illustrated in a case study, and evaluated in simulations under two scenarios. The two scenarios assume overdispersion in the abundance distribution via a negative binomial distribution or in the detection probability via a beta-binomial distribution. We evaluate the ability of the checks to detect lack of fit, and how lack of fit affects estimates of abundances.\\nC_LIO_LIThe simulations show that if the parametric assumptions are incorrect there can be severe biases in estimated abundances: negatively if there is overdispersion in abundance relative to the fitted model and positively if there is overdispersion in detection. Our goodness of fit checks performed well in detecting lack of fit when the abundance distribution is overdispersed, but struggled to detect lack of fit when detections were overdispersed. We show that the inability to detect lack of fit due to overdispersed detection is caused by a fundamental similarity between N-mixture models with beta-binomial detections and N-mixture models with negative binomial abundances.\\nC_LIO_LIThe strong biases in estimated abundances that can occur in the binomial N-mixture model when the distribution of individuals among sites, or the detection model, is mis-specified implies that checking goodness of fit is essential for sound inference in ecological studies that use these methods. To check the assumptions we provide computationally efficient goodness of fit checks that are available in an R-package nmixgof. However, even when a binomial N-mixture model appears to fit the data well, estimates are not robust in the presence of overdispersion unless additional information about detection is collected.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Microbes drive a variety of ecosystem processes and services but still many of them remain largely unexplored because of our lack of knowledge on both diversity and functionality of some potentially key microbiological compartments. This is typically the case with and within the group of bacterial predators collectively known as Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs). Here we report for the first time the abundance, distribution and diversity of the three main families of these natural and obligatory predators of gram negative bacteria in three peri-alpine lakes (e.g. lakes Annecy, Bourget and Geneva) at different depths (surface vs. 45 or 50 m) and along a few months (from August 2015 to January 2016). We show that, using PCR-DGGE and cloning-sequencing approaches, the diversity appeared relatively low and very specific to fresh waters or even of the lakes themselves. While the Peredibacteraceae family was represented mainly by a single species (i.e. Peredibacter starii), it could constitute up to 7% of the total bacterial cell abundances. Comparati vel y, the abundances of the two other families (referred to as Bdellovibrionaceae and Bacteriovaracaceae) were significantly lower. More interestingly, the distribution in the water column was very different between the three groups suggesting various life strategies/niches for each of them: Peredibactereacea dominated near surface while the Bdellovibrionaceae and the Bacteriovaracaceae were more abundant at depth. All in all, our results suggest that these bacterial predators are likely to play a significant role in mortality, carbon fluxes and prokaryotic community structure in lakes.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides are highly conserved immune effectors across the tree of life and are employed as combinations. In the beetle Tenebrio molitor, a defensin and a coleoptericin are highly expressed in vivo after inoculation with S. aureus. The defensin displays strong in vitro activity but no survival benefit in vivo. The coleoptericin provides a survival benefit in vivo, but no activity in vitro. To investigate this paradox we experimentally evolved S. aureus to increased resistance against the defensin and a combination of the defensin and coleoptericin. Genome re-sequencing showed that resistance was associated with mutations in either the ytr or nsa operons, in both AMP treatments. Strains with these mutations show longer lag phases, slower Vmax and nsa mutants reach lower final population sizes. Mutations in rpoB were showed a further increase in the lag phase in nsa mutants but not in ytr mutants. In contrast, final MICs do not segregate by mutation. All resistant lines display AMP but not antibiotic cross-resistance. Costly resistance against AMPs readily evolves for an individual AMP as well as a naturally occurring combination in vitro and provides broad protection against AMPs. Such non-specific resistance could result in strong selection on host immune systems that rely on cocktails of AMPs.",

    "abstract": "Individual response to stress is correlated with neuroticism and is an important predictor of both neuroticism and the onset of major depressive disorder (MDD). Identification of the genetics underpinning individual differences in response to negative events (stress-sensitivity) may improve our understanding of the molecular pathways involved, and its association with stress-related illnesses. We sought to generate a proxy for stress-sensitivity through modelling the interaction between SNP allele and MDD status on neuroticism score in order to identify genetic variants that contribute to the higher neuroticism seen in individuals with a lifetime diagnosis of depression compared to unaffected individuals. Meta-analysis of genome-wide interaction studies (GWIS) in UK Biobank (N = 23,092) and Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (N = 7,155) identified no genome-wide significance SNP interactions. However, gene-based tests identified a genome-wide significant gene, ZNF366, a negative regulator of glucocorticoid receptor function implicated in alcohol dependence (p = 1.48x10-7; Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold p < 2.79x10-6). Using summary statistics from the stress-sensitivity term of the GWIS, SNP heritability for stress-sensitivity was estimated at 5.0%. In models fitting polygenic risk scores of both MDD and neuroticism derived from independent GWAS, we show that polygenic risk scores derived from the UK Biobank stress-sensitivity GWIS significantly improved the prediction of MDD in Generation Scotland. This study may improve interpretation of larger genome-wide association studies of MDD and other stress-related illnesses, and the understanding of the etiological mechanisms underpinning stress-sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome of animals is emerging as an important factor influencing ecological and evolutionary processes. A major bottleneck in obtaining microbiome data from large numbers of samples is the time-consuming laboratory procedures, specifically the isolation of DNA and generation of amplicon libraries. Recently, direct PCR kits have been developed that circumvent conventional DNA extraction steps, thereby streamlining the laboratory process by reducing preparation time and costs. However, the reliability and efficacy of the direct PCR method for measuring host microbiomes has not yet been investigated other than in humans with 454-sequencing. Here, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the microbial communities obtained with direct PCR and the widely used MoBio PowerSoil DNA extraction kit in five distinct gut sample types (ileum - caecum - colon - faeces - cloaca) from 20 juvenile ostriches, using 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing. We found that direct PCR was highly comparable over a range of measures to the DNA extraction method in caecal, colon, and faecal samples. However, the two methods recovered significantly different microbiomes in cloacal, and especially ileal samples. We also sequenced 100 replicate sample pairs to evaluate repeatability during both extraction and PCR stages, and found that both methods were highly consistent for caecal, colon, and faecal samples (rs > 0.7), but had low repeatability for cloacal (rs = 0.39) and ileal (rs = -0.24) samples. This study indicates that direct PCR provides a fast, cheap, and reliable alternative to conventional DNA extraction methods for retrieving 16S data, which will aid future gut microbiome studies of animals.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptional coactivator p300 is essential for p53 transactivation, although its precise mechanism remains unclear. We report that, p53 allosterically activates the acetyltransferase activity of p300 through the enhancement of p300 autoacetylation. Cryo-electron microscopy revealed that the domain organization of p300 is substantially altered upon binding of p53, suggesting that a structural switch may underpin the activation. Acetylated p300 accumulates near the transcription start sites accompanied by a similar enrichment of activating histone marks near those sites. Disruption of p53-p300 interaction by a site-directed peptide inhibitor abolished autoacetylated p300-mediated enhanced histone acetylation, suggesting a crucial role played by the allosteric activation in p53-mediated gene regulation. Gain-of-function mutant p53, known to impart aggressive proliferative properties in tumor cells, also activate p300 autoacetylation. The same peptide abolished many of the gain-of-functions of mutant p53 as well. We conclude that allosteric activation of p300 by p53 underpins gene regulation by p53. Reversal of gain-of-function properties of mutant p53 suggests that molecules targeting the p53-p300 interface may be good candidates for anti-tumor drugs.",

The mediation analysis highlighted that mediation of the relationship by depression was equivocal (b = -0.002, bootstrapped CI -0.02 to 0.00).\\n\\nConclusions\\n\\nWhilst these preliminary data are marginal, they do suggest that associations between HIV stigma and HIV-related pain warrant further investigation. Future study should also include potential mechanisms, which may include mediation through depression.",

    "abstract": "Microscale cell-based assays have demonstrated unique capabilities in reproducing important cellular behaviors for diagnostics and basic biological research. As these assays move beyond the prototyping stage and into biological and clinical research environments, there is a need to produce microscale culture platforms more rapidly, cost-effectively, and reproducibly.  Rapid injection molding is poised to meet this need as it enables some of the benefits of traditional high volume injection molding at a fraction of the cost. However, rapid injection molding has limitations due to the material and methods used for mold fabrication. Here, we characterize advantages and limitations of rapid injection molding for microfluidic device fabrication through measurement of key features for cell culture applications including channel geometry, feature consistency, floor thickness, and surface polishing. We demonstrate phase contrast and fluorescence imaging of cells grown in rapid injection molded devices and provide design recommendations to successfully utilize rapid injection molding methods for microscale cell-based assay development in academic laboratory settings.",

    "abstract": "1.1.1 BackgroundMost healthcare data sources store information within their own unique schemas, making reliable and reproducible research challenging. Consequently, researchers have adopted various data models to improve the efficiency of research. Transforming and loading data into these models is a labor-intensive process that can alter the semantics of the original data. Therefore, we created a data model with a hierarchical structure that simplifies the transformation process and minimizes data alteration.\\n\\n1.2 MethodsThere were two design goals in constructing the tables and table relationships for the Generalized Data Model (GDM). The first was to focus on clinical codes in their original vocabularies to retain the original semantic representation of the data. The second was to retain hierarchical information present in the original data while retaining provenance. The model was tested by transforming synthetic Medicare data; Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked to Medicare claims; and electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We also tested a subsequent transformation from the GDM into the Sentinel data model.\\n\\n1.3 ResultsThe resulting data model contains 19 tables, with the Clinical Codes, Contexts, and Collections tables serving as the core of the model, and containing most of the clinical, provenance, and hierarchical information. In addition, a Mapping table allows users to apply an arbitrarily complex set of relationships among vocabulary elements to facilitate automated analyses.\\n\\n1.4 ConclusionsThe GDM offers researchers a simpler process for transforming data, clear data provenance, and a path for users to transform their data into other data models. The GDM is designed to retain hierarchical relationships among data elements as well as the original semantic representation of the data, ensuring consistency in protocol implementation as part of a complete data pipeline for researchers.",

    "abstract": "The human reference genome serves as the foundation for genomics by providing a scaffold for alignment of sequencing reads, but currently only reflects a single consensus haplotype, which impairs read alignment and downstream analysis accuracy. Reference genome structures incorporating known genetic variation have been shown to improve the accuracy of genomic analyses, but have so far remained computationally prohibitive for routine large-scale use. Here we present a graph genome implementation that enables read alignment across 2,800 diploid genomes encompassing 12.6 million SNPs and 4.0 million indels. Our Graph Genome Pipeline requires 6.5 hours to process a 30x coverage WGS sample on a system with 36 CPU cores compared with 11 hours required by the GATK Best Practices pipeline. Using complementary benchmarking experiments based on real and simulated data, we show that using a graph genome reference improves read mapping sensitivity and produces a 0.5% increase in variant calling recall, or about 20,000 additional variants being detected per sample, while variant calling specificity is unaffected. Structural variations (SVs) incorporated into a graph genome can be genotyped accurately under a unified framework. Finally, we show that iterative augmentation of graph genomes yields incremental gains in variant calling accuracy. Our implementation is a significant advance towards fulfilling the promise of graph genomes to radically enhance the scalability and accuracy of genomic analyses.",

Our light-sheet microscope can image more than 5 mm thick optically clear samples with 2.9 {+/-}0.4 m depth-resolution.

    "abstract": "In animals, somatic cells are usually diploid and are unstable when haploid for unknown reasons. In this study, by comparing isogenic human cell lines with different ploidies, we found frequent centrosome loss specifically in the haploid state, which profoundly contributed to haploid instability through monopolar spindle formation and subsequent mitotic defects. We also found that efficiency of centriole licensing and duplication, but not that of DNA replication, changes proportionally to ploidy level, causing gradual loss or frequent overduplication of centrioles in haploid and tetraploid cells, respectively. Centriole licensing efficiency seemed to be modulated by astral microtubules, whose development scaled with ploidy level, and artificial enhancement of aster formation in haploid cells restored centriole licensing efficiency to diploid levels. Haploid-specific centrosome loss was also observed in parthenogenetic mouse embryos. We propose that incompatibility between the centrosome duplication and DNA replication cycles arising from different scaling properties of these bioprocesses upon ploidy changes, underlies the instability of non-diploid somatic cells in mammals.\\n\\nSummaryYaguchi et al. show that a delay or acceleration of centriole licensing compromises the control of centrosome number in haploid or tetraploid human cells, respectively, suggesting a cellular basis of the instability of non-diploid somatic cells in mammals.",

The objective of this study was to document migratory life histories of native galaxiids and introduced salmonids from a wide latitudinal range in Chilean Patagonia (39-48{degrees}S). Otolith microchemistry data were analysed using a recursive partitioning approach to test for diadromy. Based on annular analysis of Sr:Ca ratios, a diadromous life history was detected for populations of native Aplochiton taeniatus, A. marinus, and Galaxias maculatus. Lifetime residency in freshwater was suggested for populations of A. zebra and G. platei. Among introduced salmonids, populations of Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and O. kisutch exhibited anadromous migratory patterns, whereas the population of O. mykiss screened appeared restricted to freshwater. Salmo trutta exhibited variable habitat use consistent with establishment of an ocean-type life history in some populations. The capacity and geographic scope of hydropower development is increasing and may disrupt migratory routes of diadromous fishes. Identification of diadromous species is a critical first step for preventing their loss due to hydropower development.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenies may be modelled using \\\"birth-death\\\" models for speciation and extinction, but even when a homogeneous rate of diversification is used, survivorship biases can generate remarkable rate heterogeneities through time. One such bias has been termed the \\\"push of the past\\\", by which the length of time a clade has survived is conditioned on the rate of diversification that happened to pertain at its origin. This creates the illusion of a secular rate slow-down through time that is, rather, a reversion to the mean. Here we model the controls on the push of the past, and the effect it has on clade origination times, and show that it largely depends on underlying extinction rates. An extra effect increasing early rates of lineage generation is also seen in large clades. These biases are important but relatively neglected influences on many aspects of diversification patterns, such as diversification spikes after mass extinctions and at the origins of clades; they also influence rates of fossilisation, changes in rates of phenotypic evolution and even molecular clocks. These inevitable features of surviving and/or large clades should thus not be generalised to the diversification process as a whole without additional study of small and extinct clades.",

For simplicity, it is often convenient to assume these properties to be time-invariant. In living systems, however, cells dynamically remodel the ECM and create time-dependent local environments. Here, we demonstrate that cell generated contractile forces are capable of producing substantial irreversible changes to the density and architecture of physiologically relevant ECMs - collagen I and fibrin - in a matter of minutes. We measure the 3D mechanical deformation profiles of the ECM surrounding cancer and endothelial cells during stages when force generation is active or inactive. We further correlate these measurements to both discrete fiber simulations that incorporate fiber crosslink unbinding kinetics and continuum-scale modeling. Our findings reveal that plasticity, as a mechanical law in these networks, is fundamentally related to the force-driven unbinding of fiber crosslinks. These results illustrate the dynamic nature of the mechanical environment of physiologically mimicking cell-in-gel systems.",

A deeper understanding of the molecular biology of cancer has resulted in more efficient strategies, where one or multiple drugs are adopted in novel therapies to tackle resistance.

Notwithstanding this success, it is not clear whether this combination treatment is the only or most effective treatment to block intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Here, we investigate molecular responses upon single and multi-target treatments, over time, using BRAF(V600E) mutant colorectal cancer cells as a model system. Through integration of transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomics data we obtain a comprehensive overview, revealing both known and novel responses. We primarily observe widespread upregulation of receptors tyrosine kinases and metabolic pathways upon BRAF inhibition. These findings point to mechanisms by which the drug-treated cells switch energy sources and enter a quiescent-like state as a defensive response, while additionally reactivating the MAPK pathway.",

Using single cell gene expression analyses we show that Sall4 is required to maintain the gene regulatory network in inner cell mass (ICM) cells prior to lineage commitment. Although Sall4 is not required for ICM cells to adopt a correct epiblast or primitive endoderm gene expression profile, in the absence of Sall4 early ICM cells commit to either lineage at reduced frequency.

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) is a helicase that facilitates assembly of the translation preinitiation complex by unwinding structured mRNA 5 untranslated regions. Pateamine A (PatA) and silvestrol are natural products that disrupt eIF4A function and arrest translation, thereby triggering the formation of cytoplasmic aggregates of stalled preinitiation complexes known as stress granules (SGs). Here we examined the effects of eIF4A inhibition by PatA and silvestrol on influenza A virus (IAV) protein synthesis and replication in cell culture. Treatment of infected cells with either PatA or silvestrol at early times post-infection results in SG formation, arrest of viral protein synthesis and failure to replicate the viral genome. PatA, which irreversibly binds to eIF4A, sustained long-term blockade of IAV replication following drug withdrawal, and inhibited IAV replication at concentrations that had minimal cytotoxicity. By contrast, the antiviral effects of silvestrol were fully reversible; drug withdrawal caused rapid SG dissolution and resumption of viral protein synthesis. IAV inhibition by silvestrol was invariably associated with cytotoxicity. PatA blocked replication of genetically divergent IAV strains, suggesting common dependence on host eIF4A activity. This study demonstrates the feasibility of targeting core host protein synthesis machinery to prevent viral replication.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEInfluenza A virus (IAV) relies on cellular protein synthesis to decode viral messenger RNAs. Pateamine A and silvestrol are natural products that inactivate an essential protein synthesis protein known as eIF4A. Here we show that IAV is sensitive to these eIF4A inhibitor drugs. Treatment of infected cells with pateamine A or silvestrol prevented synthesis of viral proteins, viral genome replication and release of infectious virions. The irreversible eIF4A inhibitor pateamine A sustained long-term blockade of viral replication, whereas viral protein synthesis quickly resumed after silvestrol was removed from infected cells. Prolonged incubation of either infected or uninfected cells with these drugs induced the programmed cell death cascade called apoptosis. Our findings suggest that core components of the host protein synthesis machinery are viable targets for antiviral drug discovery. The most promising drug candidates should selectively block protein synthesis in infected cells without perturbing bystander uninfected cells.",

    "abstract": "Robust kinetochore-microtubule (kMT) attachment is critical for accurate chromosome segregation. G2/M-specific depletion of human Cdt1 that localizes to kinetochores in an Ndc80 complex-dependent manner, leads to abnormal kMT attachments and mitotic arrest. This indicates an independent mitotic role for Cdt1 in addition to its prototypic function in DNA replication origin licensing. Here, we show that Cdt1 directly binds to microtubules (MTs). Endogenous or transiently expressed Cdt1 localizes to both mitotic spindle MTs and kinetochores. Deletion mapping of Cdt1 revealed that the regions comprising the middle and C-terminal winged-helix domains but lacking the N-terminal unstructured region was required for efficient MT-binding. Mitotic kinase Aurora B interacts with and phosphorylates Cdt1. Aurora B-phosphomimetic Cdt1 exhibited attenuated MT-binding and its cellular expression induced defective kMT attachments with a concomitant delay in mitotic progression. Thus we provide mechanistic insight into how Cdt1 affects overall kMT stability in an Aurora B kinase phosphorylation-dependent manner; which is envisioned to augment the MT-binding of the Ndc80 complex.\\n\\neTOC summary* Cdt1 binds to microtubules\\n\\n* The middle and the C-terminal winged-helix domains of Cdt1 are involved in MT-binding\\n\\n* Aurora B Kinase phosphorylates Cdt1 and influences its MT-binding\\n\\n* Aurora B-mediated Cdt1 phosphorylation is necessary for kMT stability and mitotic progression",

    "abstract": "As the Drosophila embryo transitions from the use of maternal RNAs to zygotic transcription, domains of open chromatin, with relatively low nucleosome density and specific histone marks, are established at promoters and enhancers involved in patterned embryonic transcription. However, it remains unclear whether open chromatin is a product of activity - transcription at promoters and patterning transcription factor binding at enhancers - or whether it is established by independent mechanisms. Recent work has implicated the ubiquitously expressed, maternal factor Zelda in this process. To assess the relative contribution of activity in the establishment of chromatin accessibility, we have probed chromatin accessibility across the anterior-posterior axis of early Drosophila melanogaster embryos by applying a transposon based assay for chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) to anterior and posterior halves of hand-dissected, cellular blastoderm embryos. We find that genome-wide chromatin accessibility is remarkably similar between the two halves. Promoters and enhancers that are active in exclusively one half of the embryo have open chromatin in the other half, demonstrating that chromatin accessibility is not a direct result of activity. However, there is a small skew at enhancers that drive transcription exclusively in either the anterior or posterior half of the embryo, with greater accessibility in the region of activity. Taken together these data support a model in which regions of chromatin accessibility are defined and established by ubiquitous factors, and fine-tuned subsequently by activity.",

    "abstract": "The growth and dynamics of epithelial tissues govern many morphogenetic processes in embryonic development. A recent quantitative transition in data acquisition, facilitated by advances in genetic and live-imaging techniques, is paving the way for new insights to these processes. Computational models can help us understand and interpret observations, and then make predictions for future experiments that can distinguish between hypothesised mechanisms. Increasingly, cell-based modelling approaches such as vertex models are being used to help understand the mechanics underlying epithelial morphogenesis. These models typically seek to reproduce qualitative phenomena, such as cell sorting or tissue buckling. However, it remains unclear to what extent quantitative data can be used to constrain these models so that they can then be used to make quantitative, experimentally testable predictions. To address this issue, we perform an in silico study to investigate whether vertex model parameters can be inferred from imaging data, and explore methods to quantify the uncertainty of such estimates. Our approach requires the use of summary statistics to estimate parameters. Here, we focus on summary statistics of cellular packing and of laser ablation experiments, as are commonly reported from imaging studies. We find that including data from repeated experiments is necessary to generate reliable parameter estimates that can facilitate quantitative model predictions.",

Habitat filtering, competition, and biogeographical effects have, for example, been inferred from signals in phenotypic and phylogenetic data. The usefulness of current inference techniques is, however, debated as the causal link between process and pattern is often lacking and processes known to be important are ignored. Here, we revisit current knowledge on community assembly across scales and, in line with several reviews that have outlined the features and challenges associated with current inference techniques, we identify a discrepancy between features of real communities and current inference techniques. We argue, that mechanistic eco-evolutionary models in combination with novel model fitting and model evaluation techniques can provide avenues for more accurate, reliable and inclusive inference. To exemplify, we implement a trait-based and spatially explicit dynamic eco-evolutionary model and discuss steps of model modification, fitting, and evaluation as an iterative approach enabling inference from diverse data sources. This suggested approach can be computationally intensive, and model fitting and parameter estimation can be challenging. We discuss optimization of model implementation, data requirements and availability, and Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) as potential solutions to challenges that may arise in our quest for better inference techniques.",

    "abstract": "Comparative studies in evolutionary genetics rely critically on evaluation of the total amount of genetic shuffling that occurs during gamete production. However, such studies have been ham-pered by the fact that there has been no direct measure of this quantity. Existing measures consider crossing over by simply counting the average number of crossovers per meiosis. This is qualitatively inadequate because the positions of crossovers along a chromosome are also critical: a crossover towards the middle of a chromosome causes more shuffling than a crossover towards the tip. More-over, traditional measures fail to consider shuffling from independent assortment of homologous chromosomes (Mendels second law). Here, we present a rigorous measure of genome-wide shuffling that does not suffer from these limitations. We define the parameter[r] as the probability that the alleles at two randomly chosen loci will be shuffled in the production of a gamete. This measure can be decomposed into separate contributions from crossover number and position and from independent assortment. Intrinsic implications of this metric include the fact that[r] is larger when crossovers are more evenly spaced, which suggests a novel selective advantage of crossover interference. Utilization of[r] is enabled by powerful emergent methods for determining crossover positions, either cytologically or by DNA sequencing. Application of our analysis to such data from human male and female reveals that: (i)[r] in humans is close to its maximum possible value of 1/2, (ii) this high level of shuffling is due almost entirely to independent assortment, whose contribution is ~30 times greater than that of crossovers.",

    "abstract": "Genetic correlation is a key population parameter that describes the shared genetic architecture of complex traits and diseases. It can be estimated by current state-of-art methods, i.e. linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and genomic restricted maximum likelihood (GREML). The massively reduced computing burden of LDSC compared to GREML makes it an attractive tool, although the accuracy (i.e., magnitude of standard errors) of LDSC estimates has not been thoroughly studied. In simulation, we show that the accuracy of GREML is generally higher than that of LDSC. When there is genetic heterogeneity between the actual sample and reference data from which LD scores are estimated, the accuracy of LDSC decreases further. In real data analyses estimating the genetic correlation between schizophrenia (SCZ) and body mass index, we show that GREML estimates based on ~150,000 individuals give a higher accuracy than LDSC estimates based on ~400,000 individuals (from combined meta-data). A GREML genomic partitioning analysis reveals that the genetic correlation between SCZ and height is significantly negative for regulatory regions, which whole genome or LDSC approach has less power to detect. We conclude that LDSC estimates should be carefully interpreted as there can be uncertainty about homogeneity among combined meta-data sets. We suggest that any interesting findings from massive LDSC analysis for a large number of complex traits should be followed up, where possible, with more detailed analyses with GREML methods, even if sample sizes are lesser.",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have been suggested to play an important role in controlling human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 or simply HIV) infection. HIV, due to its high mutation rate, can evade recognition of T cell responses variants that can not be recognized by HIV-specific CTLs. Although HIV escape from CTL responses has been well documented, factors contributing to the timing and the rate of viral escape from T cells have not been fully elucidated. Fitness costs associated with escape and magnitude of the epitope-specific T cell response are generally considered to be the key in determining timing of HIV escape. Several previous analyses generally ignored the kinetics of T cell responses in predicting viral escape by either considering constant or maximal T cell response; several studies also considered escape from different T cell responses to be independent. Here we focus our analysis on data from two patients from a recent study with relatively frequent measurements of both virus sequences and HIV-specific T cell response to determine impact of CTL kinetics on viral escape. In contrast with our expectation we found that including temporal dynamics of epitope-specific T cell response did not improve the quality of fit of different models to escape data. We also found that for well sampled escape data the estimates of the model parameters including T cell killing efficacy did not strongly depend on the underlying model for escapes: models assuming independent, sequential, or concurrent escapes from multiple CTL responses gave similar estimates for CTL killing efficacy. Interestingly, the model assuming sequential escapes (i.e., escapes occurring along a defined pathway) was unable to accurately describe data on escapes occurring rapidly within a short-time window, suggesting that some of model assumptions must be violated for such escapes. Our results thus suggest that the current sparse measurements of temporal CTL dynamics in blood bear little quantitative information to improve predictions of HIV escape kinetics. More frequent measurements using more sensitive techniques and sampling in secondary lymphoid tissues may allow to better understand whether and how CTL kinetics impacts viral escape.",

    "abstract": "Human activity has resulted in the domestication of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeasts specifically adapted to beer production. While there is evidence beer yeast domestication was accelerated by industrialization of beer, there also exists a home-brewing culture in western Norway which has passed down yeasts referred to as kveik for generations. This practice has resulted in ale yeasts which are typically highly flocculant, phenolic off flavour negative (POF-), and exhibit a high rate of fermentation, similar to previously characterized lineages of domesticated yeast. Additionally, kveik yeasts are highly temperature tolerant, likely due to the traditional practice of pitching yeast into warm (>30 {degrees}C) wort. Here, we characterize kveik yeasts from 9 different Norwegian sources via PCR fingerprinting, phenotypic screens, lab-scale fermentations, and flavour metabolite analysis using HS-SPME-GC-MS. Genetic fingerprinting via interdelta PCR suggests that kveik yeasts form a lineage distinct from other domesticated yeasts. Our analyses confirm that kveik yeasts display hallmarks of domestication such as loss of 4-vinylguaiacol production and high flocculation, and show superior thermotolerance, ethanol tolerance, fermentation rate, and unique flavour metabolite production profiles in comparison to other ale strains, suggesting a broad industrial potential for this group of yeasts.",

To optimize the efficiency of ssODN-based knock-ins in zebrafish, we developed allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) assays for introducing point mutations in tp53, cdh5 and lmna as case studies. In these point mutation strategies we introduced the codon mutations, sgRNA site mutations and restriction sites which can be detected by AS-PCR with the primers matching their respective alleles in combination with a common primer. We employed the anti-sense asymmetric oligo design as the main optimization as well as phosphorothioate oligo modification and also observed that proximity of the mutation site to the Cas9 cut site improves the efficiency when knock-ins into different genes were compared. We improved the efficiencies of two tp53 knock-ins using anti-sense asymmetric ultramer oligos (126-nt in length with homology arms of 36 and 90 nucleotides, anti-sense to the sgRNA) by 3-10 fold, the optimizations which resulted in successful founders for both tp53 knock-ins with transmission rates of 20-40 %. The initially low knock-in efficiency for tp53 mutants was likely due to the distance between the Cas9 cut site and mutations since cdh5 G767S knock-in located at the cut site had much higher founder identification and germline transmission rates. The phosphorothioate oligo modifications was used for a lamin A/C (lmna) knock-in strategy and it resulted in 40 % overall improvement in knock-in efficiency and greater knock-in consistency. We also determined that AS-PCR detected false-positive knock-ins which constituted 25-80 % of total in different strategies and developed a workflow to screen out the founders and F1 zebrafish carrying these undesirable modifications. In summary, we provide a complementary set of optimizations for CRISPR/Cas9-based ssODN knock-ins in zebrafish using a novel combination of methods.",

A major difficulty in adjudicating between these mechanisms is that the semantic similarity of objects is often highly confounded with their perceptual similarity (e.g., animate things are more perceptually similar to other animate things than to inanimate things). To address this problem, we developed a paradigm that exploits the statistical regularities of object colors while perfectly controlling for perceptual shape information, allowing us to dissociate lower-level perceptual features (i.e., color perception) from higher-level semantic knowledge (i.e., color meaning). Using multivoxel-pattern analyses of fMRI data, we observed a striking double dissociation between the processing of color information at a perceptual and at a semantic level along the posterior to anterior axis of the ventral visual pathway. Specifically, we found that the visual association region V4 assigned similar representations to objects with similar colors, regardless of object category. In contrast, perirhinal cortex, at the apex of the ventral visual stream, assigned similar representations to semantically similar objects, even when this was in opposition to their perceptual similarity. These findings suggest that perirhinal cortex untangles the representational space of lower-level perceptual features and organizes visual objects according to their semantic interpretations.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve interfaces show promise in making prosthetic limbs more biomimetic and ultimately more intuitive and useful for patients. However, approaches to assess these emerging technologies are limited in their scope and the insight they provide. When outfitting a prosthesis with a new feedback system it would be helpful to quantify its physiological correspondence, i.e. how well the experimental feedback mimics the perceived feedback in an intact limb. Here we present an approach to quantify physiological correspondence using a modified crossmodal congruency task. We trained 60 able-bodied subjects to control a bypass prosthesis under different feedback conditions and training durations. We find that the crossmodal congruency effect (CCE) score is sensitive to changes in feedback modality (multi-way ANOVA; F(2,48) = 6.02, p<0.05). After extended training, the CCE score increased as the spatial separation between expected and perceived feedback decreased (unpaired t-test, p<0.05). We present a model that can quantitatively estimate physiological correspondence given the CCE result and the measured spatial separation of the feedback. This quantification approach gives researchers a tool to assess an aspect of emerging augmented feedback systems that is not measurable with current motor assessments.",

    "abstract": "Meristems contain groups of indeterminate stem cells that are critical for organ initiation throughout plant development. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintains itself and initiates all shoot organs, such as leaves, floral organs and axillary branch meristems. Development and balanced proliferation of the SAM is regulated by a feedback loop between CLAVATA (CLV) and WUSCHEL (WUS) signaling. CLV signaling is initiated by secretion of the CLV3 peptide ligand, which is perceived directly or indirectly by a number of Leucine-Rich-Repeat (LRR) receptor-like kinases, including CLV1 and BARELY ANY MERISTEM (BAM) 1-3, and RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 2 (RPK2), as well as the receptor-like protein CLV2 in a complex with the CORYNE (CRN) pseudokinase. However, CLV2, and its maize ortholog FASCIATED EAR2 (FEA2) appear to function in signaling by several related CLV3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) peptide ligands, including CLV3. Nevertheless, it remains unknown how CLV2 or FEA2 transmit specific signals from distinct CLE peptides. Here we show that FEA2 is involved in signaling from at least 2 distinct CLE peptides, ZmCLE7, a maize CLV3 ortholog, and ZmFON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (ZmFCP1), a newly identified CLE peptide functioning in SAM regulation. Signaling from these 2 different CLE peptides appears to be transmitted through 2 different candidate downstream effectors, COMPACT PLANT2 (CT2), the alpha subunit of the maize heterotrimeric G protein, and maize CRN. Our data provide a novel framework to understand how diverse signaling peptides can activate different downstream pathways through common receptor proteins.",

    "abstract": "Recent pharmacogenomic studies profiled large panels of cancer cell lines against hundreds of approved drugs and experimental chemical compounds. The overarching goal of these screens is to measure sensitivity of cell lines to chemical perturbation, correlate these measures to genomic features, and thereby develop novel predictors of drug response. However, leveraging this valuable data is challenging due to the lack of standards for annotating cell lines and chemical compounds, and quantifying drug response. Moreover, it has been recently shown that the complexity and complementarity of the experimental protocols used in the field result in high levels of technical and biological variation in the in vitro pharmacological profiles. There is therefore a need for new tools to facilitate rigorous comparison and integrative analysis of large-scale drug screening datasets. To address this issue, we have developed PharmacoDB (pharmacodb.pmgenomics.ca), a database integrating the largest pharmacogenomic studies published to date. Here, we describe how the curation of cell line and chemical compound identifiers maximizes the overlap between datasets and how users can leverage such data to compare and extract robust drug phenotypes. PharmacoDB provides a unique resource to mine a compendium of curated pharmacogenomic datasets that are otherwise disparate and difficult to integrate.\\n\\nKey pointsO_LICuration of cell line and drug identifiers in the largest pharmacogenomic studies published to date\\nC_LIO_LIUniform processing of drug sensitivity data to reduce heterogeneity across studies\\nC_LIO_LIMultiple drug response summary metrics enabling visual comparison and integrative analysis\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Protein kinases lie at the heart of cell signalling processes, constitute one of the largest human domain families and are often mutated in disease. Kinase target recognition at the active site is in part determined by a few amino acids around the phosphoacceptor residue. These preferences vary across kinases and despite the increased knowledge of target substrates little is known about how most preferences are encoded in the kinase sequence and how these preferences evolve. Here, we used alignment-based approaches to identify 30 putative specificity determinant residues (SDRs) for 16 preferences. These were studied using structural models and were validated by activity assays of mutant kinases. Mutation data from patient cancer samples revealed that kinase specificity is often targeted in cancer to a greater extent than catalytic residues. Throughout evolution we observed that kinase specificity is strongly conserved across orthologs but can diverge after gene duplication as illustrated by the evolution of the G-protein coupled receptor kinase family. The identified SDRs can be used to predict kinase specificity from sequence and aid in the interpretation of evolutionary or disease-related genomic variants.",

    "abstract": "Many questions in ecology are best addressed using observational data because they concern spatial or temporal scales where experimentation is impractical. Null models, which make predictions in the absence of a particular ecological mechanism, are instrumental for making inferences in these situations, but which null models to use or how to best test them is often unclear; this ambiguity is problematic because different null models and tests can yield different results, suggesting contradictory ecological mechanisms. To address these challenges, this paper presents an overar ching framework for the development and testing of null models, in which desirable models and tests are obtained as solutions to mathematical optimization problems. As an example of how the framework can be applied, this paper shows how it can be used to design null model tests to check for effects of interspecific interactions on species co-occurrence patterns. A minimal sufficient statistic (metric) for effects of interspecific interactions is derived, which achieves the maximal level of data compression without losing information present in the data about interspecific in teractions. Existing, intuitive statistics are shown to lack this property. The paper then derives a statistical hypothesis test that has the greatest possible power (sen sitivity) for detecting effects of competition and facilitation given a controlled false positive rate. This test is shown numerically to improve greatly over existing tests. The optimization paradigm allows the most accurate inferences possible, and should be applicable throughout ecology where null models are used to make inferences.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown an increased risk for a range of mental health issues in children born to both younger and older parents compared to children of average-aged parents. However, until recently, it was not clear if these increased risks are due to psychosocial factors associated with age or if parents at higher genetic risk for psychiatric disorders tend to have children at an earlier or later age. We previously used a novel design to reveal a latent mechanism of genetic association between schizophrenia and age of mothers at the birth of their first child (AFB). Here, we use independent data from the UK Biobank (N=38,892) to replicate the finding of an association between predicted genetic risk of schizophrenia and AFB in women, end to estimate the genetic correlation between schizophrenia and AFB in women stratified into younger and older groups. We find evidence for an association between predicted genetic risk of schizophrenia and AFB in women (P-value=1.12E-05), and we show genetic heterogeneity between younger and older AFB groups (P-value=3.45E-03). The genetic correlation between schizophrenia and AFB in the younger AFB group is -0.16 (SE=0.04) while that between schizophrenia and AFB in the older AFB group is 0.14 (SE=0.08). Our results suggest that early, and perhaps also late, age at first birth in women is associated with increased genetic risk for schizophrenia. These findings contribute new insights into factors contributing to the complex bio-social risk architecture underpinning the association between parental age and offspring mental health.",

    "abstract": "Humans have a comparatively higher rate of more polymorphisms in regulatory regions of the primate CCR5 gene, an immune system gene with both general and specific functions. This has been interpreted as allowing flexibility and diversity of gene expression in response to varying disease loads. A broad expression repertoire is useful to humans--the only globally distributed primate--due to our unique adaptive pattern that increased pathogen exposure and disease loads (e.g., sedentism, subsistence practices). The main objective of the study was to determine if the previously observed human pattern of increased variation extended to other members of our genus, Homo. The data for this study are mined from the published genomes of extinct hominins (four Neandertals and two Denisovans), an ancient human (Ust-Ishim), and modern humans (1000 Genomes). An average of 15 polymorphisms per individual were found in human populations (with a total of 262 polymorphisms). There were 94 polymorphisms identified across extinct Homo (an average of 13 per individual) with 41 previously observed in modern humans and 53 novel polymorphisms (32 in Denisova and 21 in Neandertal). Neither the frequency nor distribution of polymorphisms across gene regions exhibit significant differences within the genus Homo. Thus, humans are not unique with regards to the increased frequency of regulatory polymorphisms and the evolution of variation patterns across CCR5 gene appears to have originated within the genus. A broader evolutionary perspective on regulatory flexibility may be that it provided an advantage during the transition to confrontational foraging (and later hunting) that altered human-environment interaction as well as during migration to Eurasia and encounters with novel pathogens.",

    "abstract": "A high-quality reference genome assembly is a valuable tool for the study of non- model organisms across disciplines. Genomic techniques can provide important insights about past population sizes, local adaptation, and even aid in the development of breeding management plans. This information can be particularly important for fields like conservation genetics, where endangered species require critical and immediate attention. However, funding for genomic-based methods can be sparse for conservation projects, as costs for general species management can consume budgets. Here we report the generation of high-quality reference genomes for the African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) at a low cost, thereby facilitating future studies of this endangered canid. We generated assemblies for three individuals from whole blood samples using the linked-read 10x Genomics Chromium system. The most continuous assembly had a scaffold N50 of 21 Mb, a contig N50 of 83 Kb, and completely reconstructed 95% of conserved mammalian genes as reported by BUSCO v2, indicating a high assembly quality. Thus, we show that 10x Genomics Chromium data can be used to effectively generate high-quality genomes of mammal species from Illumina short-read data of intermediate coverage ([~]25-50x). Interestingly, the African wild dog shows a much higher heterozygosity than other species of conservation concern, possibly as a result of its behavioral ecology. The availability of reference genomes for non-model organisms will facilitate better genetic monitoring of threatened species such as the African wild dog. At the same time, they can help researchers and conservationists to better understand the ecology and adaptability of those species in a changing environment.",

    "abstract": "Network oscillations across and within brain areas are critical for learning and performance in memory tasks. While a large amount of work has focused on the generation of neural oscillations, their effects on neuronal populations spiking activity and information encoding is less known. Here, we use computational modeling and in vivo recording to demonstrate that a shift in sub-threshold resonance can interact with oscillating input to ensure that networks of neurons properly encode new information represented in external inputs to the weights of recurrent synaptic connections. Using a neuronal network model, we find that due to an input-current dependent shift in their resonance response, individual neurons in a network will arrange their phases of firing to represent varying strengths of their respective inputs. As networks encode information, neurons fire more synchronously, and this effect limits the extent to which further \\\"learning\\\" (in the form of changes in synaptic strength) can occur. We also demonstrate that sequential patterns of neuronal firing can be accurately stored in the network; these sequences are later reproduced without external input (in the context of sub-threshold oscillations) in both the forward and reverse directions (as has been observed following learning in vivo). To test whether a similar mechanism could act in vivo, we show that periodic stimulation of hippocampal neurons coordinates network activity and functional connectivity in a frequency-dependent manner. We conclude that sub-threshold resonance provides a plausible network-level mechanism to accurately encode and retrieve information without over-strengthening connections between neurons.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionCigarette smoke is an aerosol containing microparticles that carry nicotine into lung alveolar region where nicotine is rapidly absorbed into circulation. Nicotine exposure in smokers is a chronic intermittent process, with intake during wakefulness and abstinence during sleep resulting in circadian fluctuation of blood nicotine levels. Here we present a smoking-relevant nicotine exposure device and rodent model.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a computer controlled integrated platform where freely moving rodents can be exposed to episodic nicotine aerosol on an investigator-designed schedule. Rats were exposed to nicotine aerosol once every half hr in the dark phase of 12/12-hr dark/light cycles for 10 days. Plasma nicotine and its metabolite cotinine levels were determined with a LC-MS/MS method.\\n\\nResultsWe characterized the aerosol in the breathing zone of the rodent exposure chamber. The droplet size distribution was within the respirable diameter range. The system can generate a wide range of nicotine concentrations in air that meet a variety of experimental needs. We optimized the parameters of aerosol generation and exposure: plasma nicotine and cotinine concentrations reached 30-35 ng/ml and 190-240 ng/ml, respectively. The nicotine levels and circadian patterns resembled the pharmacokinetic pattern of human smokers.\\n\\nConclusionsWe developed an aerosol system that can produce chronic intermittent nicotine exposure in unanesthetized and unrestrained rodents with route of administration and circadian blood pharmacokinetics resembling human smokers. This methodology is a novel tool for studies of behavior, pharmacology and toxicology of chronic nicotine exposure, nicotine addiction, tobacco-related diseases, teratogenicity, and for discovery of therapeutics.\\n\\nImplicationsWe developed a method and an alveolar region-targeted aerosol system that provides chronic intermittent nicotine exposure in rodents. The method produces clinically relevant animal models with the route of administration and circadian pharmacokinetics resembling human smokers. This method is a novel tool for understanding the health effects of chronic nicotine exposures such as with tobacco cigarettes, E-cigarettes and other tobacco products, for studies of pharmacology, toxicology, nicotine addiction, tobacco-related diseases, and for discovery of medications.",

    "abstract": "Maternal smoking with obligatory nicotine inhalation is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, fetal growth retardation and developmental defects. We tested the hypothesis that cigarette smoking-relevant nicotine inhalation during pregnancy impairs cardiovascular function and uterine hemodynamics with consequential fetal ischemia. Pregnant rats exposed to episodic inhaled nicotine via a novel lung alveolar region-targeted aerosol method produced nicotine pharmacokinetics resembling cigarette smoking in humans. This clinically relevant nicotine aerosol inhalation (NAI) induced transient reduction and irregular fluctuations in uterine artery blood flow associated with cardiac arrhythmia and high magnitude irregular fluctuations of systemic blood pressure. The arrhythmia included sinoatrial (SA) block, sinus arrest, 2o and 3o atrioventricular (A-V) block and supraventricular escape rhythm. These effects were blocked by the nicotinic receptor (nAChR) antagonist mecamylamine. Resection of the ovarian nerve, which innervates uterine blood vessels, counteracted the NAI-induced reduction in uterine blood flow. We suggest that the rapid rise pattern of arterial blood nicotine concentration stimulates and then desensitizes autonomic nAChRs leading to disruptions of cardiac function as well as systemic and uterine hemodynamics that reduces uteroplacental blood flow, a mechanism underlying maternal smoking-associated pregnancy complications and developmental disorders. These findings challenge the safety of pure nicotine inhalation, i.e., E-cigarettes.",

    "abstract": "In diseases of many parenchymatous organs, heterogenous detoriation of individual functional units determines the clinical prognosis. However, the molecular characterization of these subunits remains a technological challenge that needs to be addressed in order to better understand pathological mechanisms. Sclerotic and proteinuric glomerular kidney disease is a frequent and heterogeneous disease which affects a fraction of nephrons, glomeruli and draining tubules, to variable extents, and for which no treatment exists. Here, we developed and applied an antibody-independent methodology to investigate heterogeneity of individual nephron segment proteomes from mice with proteinuric kidney disease. This \\\"one-segment-one-proteome-approach\\\" defines mechanistic connections between upstream (glomerular) and downstream (tubular) nephron segment populations. In single glomeruli from two different mouse models of sclerotic glomerular disease, we identified a coherent protein expression module consisting of extracellular matrix protein deposition (reflecting glomerular sclerosis), glomerular albumin (reflecting proteinuria) and LAMP1, a lysosomal protein. This module was associated with a loss of podocyte marker proteins. In an attempt to target this protein co-expression module, genetic ablation of LAMP1-correlated lysosomal proteases in mice could ameliorate glomerular damage. Furthermore, individual glomeruli from patients with genetic sclerotic and non-sclerotic proteinuric diseases demonstrated increased abundance of lysosomal proteins, in combination with a decreased abundance of the mutated gene products. Therefore, increased glomerular lysosomal load is a conserved key mechanism in proteinuric kidney diseases, and the technology applied here can be implemented to address heterogeneous pathophysiology in a variety of diseases at a sub-biopsy scale",
