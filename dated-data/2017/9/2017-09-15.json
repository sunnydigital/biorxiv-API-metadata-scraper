    "abstract": "Plant defenses are very diverse and often involve contrasted costs and benefits. Quantitative defenses, whose protective effect is dependent on the dose, are effective against a wide range of herbivores, but often divert energy from growth and reproduction. Qualitative defenses often have little allocation costs. However, while deterrent to some herbivores, they often incur costs through other interactions within the community (eg, decrease in pollination or attraction of other enemies). In the present work, we model the evolutionary dynamics of these two types of defenses, as well and the evolutionary dynamics of the herbivore niche. We assess the effects of such evolutionary dynamics for the maintenance of diversity within the plant-herbivore system, and for the functioning of such systems under various levels of resource availability. We show that the two types of defenses have different implications. Evolution of quantitative defenses often helps to maintain or even increase diversity, while evolution of qualitative defenses most often has a detrimental effect on species coexistence. From a functional point of view, increased resource availability selects for higher levels of quantitative defenses, which reduces top-down controls exerted by herbivores. Resource availability does not affect qualitative defenses, nor the evolution of the herbivore niche. The growing evidence that plant defenses are diverse in types, benefits and costs has large implications not only for the evolution of these traits, but also for their impacts on community diversity and ecosystem functioning.",

    "abstract": "Decisions are accompanied by a feeling of confidence, i.e., a belief about the decision being correct. Confidence accuracy is critical, notably in high-stakes situations such as medical or financial decisionmaking. Here, we investigated how incentive motivation influences confidence accuracy by combining a perceptual task with a confidence incentivization mechanism. Importantly, by varying the magnitude and valence (gains or losses) of monetary incentives, we orthogonalized their motivational and affective components. Corroborating theories of rational decision-making and motivation, our results first reveal that the motivational value of incentives improves aspects of confidence accuracy. However, in line with a value-confidence interaction hypothesis we further show that the affective value of incentives concurrently biases confidence reports, thus degrading confidence accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that the motivational and affective effects of incentives differentially impact how confidence builds on perceptual evidence. Altogether, these findings may provide new hints about confidence miscalibration in healthy or pathological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Genetics can provide a systematic approach to discovering the tissues and cell types relevant for a complex disease or trait. Identifying these tissues and cell types is critical for following up on non-coding allelic function, developing ex-vivo models, and identifying therapeutic targets. Here, we analyze gene expression data from several sources, including the GTEx and PsychENCODE consortia, together with genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary statistics for 48 diseases and traits with an average sample size of 169,331, to identify disease-relevant tissues and cell types. We develop and apply an approach that uses stratified LD score regression to test whether disease heritability is enriched in regions surrounding genes with the highest specific expression in a given tissue. We detect tissue-specific enrichments at FDR < 5% for 34 diseases and traits across a broad range of tissues that recapitulate known biology. In our analysis of traits with observed central nervous system enrichment, we detect an enrichment of neurons over other brain cell types for several brain-related traits, enrichment of inhibitory over excitatory neurons for bipolar disorder but excitatory over inhibitory neurons for schizophrenia and body mass index, and enrichments in the cortex for schizophrenia and in the striatum for migraine. In our analysis of traits with observed immunological enrichment, we identify enrichments of T cells for asthma and eczema, B cells for primary biliary cirrhosis, and myeloid cells for Alzheimer's disease, which we validated with independent chromatin data. Our results demonstrate that our polygenic approach is a powerful way to leverage gene expression data for interpreting GWAS signal.",

    "abstract": "Photosystem II is a photochemical reaction center that catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of water to molecular oxygen. Water oxidation is the distinctive photochemical reaction that permitted the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis and the eventual rise of Eukaryotes. At what point during the history of life an ancestral photosystem evolved the capacity to oxidize water still remains unknown. Here we study the evolution of the core reaction center proteins of Photosystem II using sequence and structural comparisons in combination with Bayesian relaxed molecular clocks. Our results indicate that a homodimeric photosystem with sufficient oxidizing power to split water had already appeared in the early Archean about a billion years before the most recent common ancestor of all described Cyanobacteria capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, and well before the diversification of some of the known groups of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria. Based on a structural and functional rationale we hypothesize that this early Archean photosystem was capable of water oxidation and had already evolved some level of protection against the formation of reactive oxygen species, which would place primordial forms of oxygenic photosynthesis at a very early stage in the evolutionary history of life.",

The existence of persistent genetic variation within natural populations presents an evolutionary problem as natural selection and genetic drift tend to erode genetic diversity. Models of balancing selection were developed to account for the high and sometimes extreme levels of polymorphism found in many natural populations. Negative frequency-dependent selection may be the most powerful selective force maintaining balanced natural polymorphisms but it is also commonly misinterpreted. The aim of this review is to clarify the processes underlying negative frequency-dependent selection, describe classes of natural polymorphisms that can and cannot result from these processes, and discuss observational and experimental data that can aid in accurately identifying the processes that generated or are maintain diversity in nature. Finally, I consider the importance of accurately describing the processes affecting genetic diversity within populations as it relates to research progress.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is one of the leading causes of invasive fungal infection in humans worldwide. C. neoformans uses macrophages as a proliferative niche to increase infective burden and avoid immune surveillance. However, the specific mechanisms by which C. neoformans manipulates host immunity to promote its growth during infection remain ill-defined. Here we demonstrate that eicosanoid lipid mediators manipulated and/or produced by C. neoformans play a key role in regulating pathogenesis. C. neoformans is known to secrete several eicosanoids that are highly similar to those found in vertebrate hosts. Using eicosanoid deficient cryptococcal mutants{Delta} plb1 and{Delta} lac1, we demonstrate that prostaglandin E2 is required by C. neoformans for proliferation within macrophages and in vivo during infection. Genetic and pharmacological disruption of host PGE2 synthesis is not required for promotion of cryptococcal growth by eicosanoid production. We find that PGE2 must be dehydrogenated into 15-keto-PGE2 to promote fungal growth, a finding that implicated the host nuclear receptor PPAR-{gamma}. C. neoformans infection of macrophages activates host PPAR-{gamma} and its inhibition is sufficient to abrogate the effect of 15-keto-PGE2 in promoting fungal growth during infection. Thus, we describe the first mechanism of reliance on pathogen-derived eicosanoids in fungal pathogenesis and the specific role of 15-keto-PGE2 and host PPAR-{gamma} in cryptococcosis.\n\nAuthor SummaryCryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that is responsible for significant numbers of deaths in the immunocompromised population worldwide. Here we address whether eicosanoids produced by C. neoformans manipulate host innate immune cells during infection. Cryptococcus neoformans produces several eicosanoids that are notable for their similarity to vertebrate eicosanoids, it is therefore possible that fungal-derived eicosanoids may provoke physiological effects in the host. Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo infection models we identify a specific eicosanoid species - prostaglandin E2 - that is required by C. neoformans for growth during infection. We subsequently show that prostaglandin E2 must be converted to 15-keto-prostaglandin E2 within the host before it has these effects. Furthermore, we find that prostaglandin E2/15-keto-prostaglandin E2 mediated virulence is via activation of host PPAR-{gamma} - an intracellular eicosanoid receptor known to interact with 15-keto-PGE2.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-associated protein Cas9 is a widely used genome editing tool that recognizes and cleaves target DNA through the assistance of a single-guide RNA (sgRNA). Structural studies have demonstrated the multi-domain architecture of Cas9 and sequential domain movements upon binding to the sgRNA and the target DNA. These studies also hinted at the flexibility between domains, but whether these flexible movements occur in solution is unclear. Here, we directly observed dynamic fluctuations of multiple Cas9 domains, using single-molecule FRET. The flexible domain movements allow Cas9 to adopt transient conformations beyond those captured in the crystal structures. Importantly, the HNH nuclease domain in Cas9 only accessed the DNA cleavage position during such flexible movements, suggesting the importance of this flexibility in the DNA cleavage process. Our FRET data also revealed the conformational flexibility of apo-Cas9, which may play a role in the assembly with the sgRNA. Collectively, our results highlight the potential role of domain fluctuations in driving Cas9-catalyzed DNA cleavage.",

Kinase MIB-binding profiles at baseline without perturbation proteomically distinguished the four breast cancer subtypes. Kinases lacking defined functions in breast cancer were highly represented in the MIB-binding taxonomies. We show that these understudied kinases, whose disease associations and pharmacology are generally unexplored, are integrated in kinase signaling subnetworks with kinases that have been previously well characterized in breast cancer. Computationally it was possible to define subtypes using profiles of less than 50 of the more than 300 kinases bound to MIBs that included understudied as well as metabolic and lipid kinases. Furthermore, analysis of MIB-binding profiles established potential functional annotations for these understudied kinases. Thus, comprehensive MIBs-based capture of kinases provides a unique proteomics-based method for integration of poorly characterized kinases of the understudied kinome into functional subnetworks in breast cancer cells and tumors that is not possible using genomic strategies. The MIB-binding profiles readily defined subtype-selective differential adaptive kinome reprogramming in response to targeted kinase inhibition, demonstrating how MIB profiles can be used in determining dynamic kinome changes that result in subtype selective phenotypic state changes.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by prior data on local cortical shrinkage and intracortical myelination, we predicted age-related changes in topological organisation of cortical structural networks during adolescence. We estimated structural correlation from magnetic resonance imaging measures of cortical thickness at 308 regions in a sample of N=297 healthy participants, aged 14-24 years. We used a novel sliding-window analysis to measure age-related changes in network attributes globally, locally and in the context of several community partitions of the network. We found that the strength of structural correlation generally decreased as a function of age. Association cortical regions demonstrated a sharp decrease in nodal degree (hubness) from 14 years, reaching a minimum at approximately 19 years, and then levelling off or even slightly increasing until 24 years. Greater and more prolonged age-related changes in degree of cortical regions within the brain network were associated with faster rates of adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage. The brain regions that demonstrated the greatest age-related changes were concentrated within prefrontal modules. We conclude that human adolescence is associated with biologically plausible changes in structural imaging markers of brain network organization, consistent with the concept of tuning or consolidating anatomical connectivity between frontal cortex and the rest of the connectome.",

    "abstract": "Asthma is the most common chronic disease of children, with significant racial/ethnic differences in prevalence, morbidity, mortality and therapeutic response. Albuterol, a bronchodilator medication, is the first-line therapy for asthma treatment worldwide. We performed the largest whole genome sequencing (WGS) pharmacogenetics study to date using data from 1,441 minority children with asthma who had extremely high or low bronchodilator drug response (BDR). We identified population-specific and shared pharmacogenetic variants associated with BDR, including genome-wide significant (p < 3.53 x 10-7) and suggestive (p < 7.06 x 10-6) loci near genes previously associated with lung capacity (DNAH5), immunity (NFKB1 and PLCB1), and {beta}-adrenergic signaling pathways (ADAMTS3 and COX18). Functional analyses centered on NFKB1 revealed potential regulatory function of our BDR-associated SNPs in bronchial smooth muscle cells. Specifically, these variants are in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs in a functionally active enhancer, and are also expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for a neighboring gene, SLC39A8. Given the lack of other asthma study populations with WGS data on minority children, replication of our rare variant associations is infeasible. We attempted to replicate our common variant findings in five independent studies with GWAS data. The age-specific associations previously found in asthma and asthma-related traits suggest that the over-representation of adults in our replication populations may have contributed to our lack of statistical replication, despite the functional relevance of the NFKB1 variants demonstrated by our functional assays.

Albuterol, a bronchodilator medication, is the first-line therapy for asthma treatment worldwide. In the U.S., asthma prevalence is the highest among Puerto Ricans, intermediate among African Americans and lowest in Whites and Mexicans. Asthma disparities extend to mortality, which is four- to five-fold higher in Puerto Ricans and African Americans compared to Mexicans [1]. Puerto Ricans and African Americans, the populations with the highest asthma prevalence and death rate, also have the lowest albuterol bronchodilator drug response (BDR). We conducted the largest pharmacogenetic study using whole genome sequencing data from 1,441 minority children with asthma who had extremely high or low albuterol bronchodilator drug response. We identified population-specific and shared pharmacogenetic variants associated with BDR. Our findings help inform the direction of future development of asthma medications and our study advances the foundation of precision medicine for at-risk, yet understudied, racially/ethnically diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific reverse engineering of transcriptional networks has uncovered master regulators (MRs) of cellular networks in various cancers, yet the application of this method to neuropsychiatric disorders is largely unexplored. Here, using RNA-Seq data on postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from schizophrenia (SCZ) patients and control subjects, we deconvolved the transcriptional network to identify MRs that mediate expression of a large body of target genes. Together with an independent RNA-Seq data on cultured cells derived from olfactory neuroepithelium, we identified TCF4, a leading SCZ risk locus implicated by genome-wide association studies, as one of the top candidate MRs that may be potentially dysregulated in SCZ. We validated the dysregulated TCF4-related transcriptional network through examining the transcription factor binding footprints inferred from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neuronal ATAC-Seq data, as well as direct binding sites obtained from ChIP-seq data in SH-SY5Y cells. The predicted TCF4 transcriptional targets were enriched for genes showing transcriptomic changes upon knockdown of TCF4 in hiPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPC) and glutamatergic neurons (Glut_N), based on observations from three separate cell lines. The altered TCF4 gene network perturbations in NPC, as compared to that in Glut_N, was more similar to the expression differences in the TCF4 gene network observed in the DLPFC of individuals with SCZ. Moreover, TCF4-associated gene expression changes in NPC were more enriched than Glut_N for pathways involved in neuronal activity, genome-wide significant SCZ risk genes, and SCZ-associated de novo mutations. Our results suggest that TCF4 may potentially serve as a MR of a gene network that confers susceptibility to SCZ at early stage of neurodevelopment, highlighting the importance of network dysregulation involving core genes and many hundreds of peripheral genes in conferring susceptibility to neuropsychiatric diseases.",

    "abstract": "It is well-known that breast tumors exhibit different expression patterns that can be used to assign intrinsic subtypes - the PAM50 assay, for example, categorizes tumors into: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched and Basal-like - yet tumors are often more complex than categorization can describe. We used 911 sporadic breast tumors to reparameterize expression from the PAM50 genes to five orthogonal tumor dimensions using principal components (PC). Three dimensions captured intrinsic subtype, two dimensions were novel, and all replicated in 945 TCGA tumors. By definition dimensions are independent, an important attribute for inclusion in downstream studies exploring effects of tumor diversity. One application where tumor subtyping has failed to provide impact is susceptibility genetics. Germline genetic heterogeneity reduces power for gene-finding. The identification of heritable tumor characteristics has potential to increase homogeneity. We compared 238 breast tumors from high-risk pedigrees not attributable to BRCA1 or BRCA2 to 911 sporadic breast tumors. Two PC dimensions were significantly enriched in the pedigrees (intrinsic subtypes were not). We performed proof-of-concept gene-mapping in one enriched pedigree and identified a 0.5 Mb genomewide significant region at 12q15 that segregated to the 8 breast cancer cases with the most extreme PC tumors through 32 meioses (p=2.6x10-8). In conclusion, our study: suggests a new approach to describe tumor diversity; supports the hypothesis that tumor characteristics are heritable providing new avenues for germline studies; and proposes a new breast cancer locus. Reparameterization of expression patterns may similarly inform other studies attempting to model the effects of tumor heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Dyslipidemia is common among patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We aimed to test the association and causality between blood lipids and ALS, using polygenic analyses on the summary results of genome-wide association studies. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) risk alleles were significantly associated with a higher risk of ALS. Using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) specifically associated with LDL-C and TC as the instrumental variables, statistically significant causal effects of LDL-C and TC on ALS risk were identified in Mendelian randomization analysis. No significant association was noted between PRS based on triglycerides or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol risk alleles and ALS, and the PRS based on ALS risk alleles were not associated with any studied lipids. This study supports that high levels of LDL-C and TC are risk factors for ALS, and it also suggests a causal relationship of LDL-C and TC to ALS.",

    "abstract": "Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is essential for the elongation and maintenance of eukaryotic cilia and flagella. Due to the traffic jam of multiple trains at the ciliary tip, how IFT trains are remodeled in these turnaround zones cannot be determined by conventional imaging. Using Photogate, we visualized the full range of movement of single IFT trains and motors in Chlamydomonas flagella. Anterograde trains split apart and IFT complexes mix with each other at the tip to assemble retrograde trains. Dynein-1b is carried to the tip by kinesin-II as inactive cargo on anterograde trains. Unlike dynein-1b, kinesin-II detaches from IFT trains at the tip and diffuses in flagella. As the flagellum grows longer, diffusion delays return of kinesin-II to the basal body, depleting kinesin-II available for anterograde transport. Our results suggest that dissociation of kinesin-II from IFT trains serves as a negative feedback mechanism that facilitates flagellar length control in Chlamydomonas.",

    "abstract": "We describe a method for measuring genome editing efficiency from in silico analysis of high-resolution melt curve data. The melt curve data derived from amplicons of genome-edited or unmodified target sites were processed to remove the background fluorescent signal emanating from free fluorophore and then corrected for temperature-dependent quenching of fluorescence of double-stranded DNA-bound fluorophore. Corrected data were normalized and numerically differentiated to obtain the first derivatives of the melt curves. These were then mathematically modeled as a sum or superposition of minimal number of Gaussian components. Using Gaussian parameters determined by modeling of melt curve derivatives of unedited samples, we were able to model melt curve derivatives from genetically altered target sites where the mutant population could be accommodated using an additional Gaussian component. From this, the proportion contributed by the mutant component in the target region amplicon could be accurately determined. Mutant component computations compared well with the mutant frequency determination from next generation sequencing data. The results were also consistent with our earlier studies that used difference curve areas from high-resolution melt curves for determining the efficiency of genome-editing reagents. The advantage of the described method is that it does not require calibration curves to estimate proportion of mutants in amplicons of genome-edited target sites.\\n\\nSignificance StatementGenome editing has been revolutionized by the engineering of molecular scissors that cut DNA at a predetermined location on the chromosome. When these molecular scissors are expressed within cells, these scissors cut the genomic DNA at the designated target site, and the cells respond by repairing the cut sites. This repair process frequently introduces mutations at the target cut site. The more efficient the molecular scissors, the more number of cells in a treated culture dish exhibit these mutations at the cut site. Investigators therefore design several molecular scissors targeting the same region on the chromosome to identify the best ones. We describe a new recipe to measure scissors efficiency in target site cutting.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a new conceptual framework and a model-based interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics and generating mechanisms of non-linear dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations based on the contributions of each of the systems, by exploiting first principles from the theory of computability and algorithmic information. This calculus entails finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic attractor landscape, affording an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they can be controlled on the other plane. Based on these methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the systems actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields a suite of universal parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle and a systems (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription Factor network) and to evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating naive from Th17 cells, and the CellNet database). We highlight their ability to pinpoint key elements (genes) related to cell function and cell development, conforming to biological knowledge from experimentally validated data and the literature, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a systems dynamics in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe increasing application of next generation sequencing technologies has led to the availability of thousands of reference genomes, often providing multiple genomes for the same or closely related species. The current approach to represent a species or a population with a single reference sequence and a set of variations cannot represent their full diversity and introduces bias towards the chosen reference. There is a need for the representation of multiple sequences in a composite way that is compatible with existing data sources for annotation and suitable for established sequence analysis methods. At the same time, this representation needs to be easily accessible and extendable to account for the constant change of available genomes.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce seq-seq-pan, a framework that provides methods for adding or removing new genomes from a set of aligned genomes and uses these to construct a whole genome alignment. Throughout the sequential workflow the alignment is optimized for generating a representative linear presentation of the aligned set of genomes, that enables its usage for annotation and in downstream analyses.\\n\\nConclusionsBy providing dynamic updates and optimized processing, our approach enables the usage of whole genome alignment in the field of pan-genomics. In addition, the sequential workflow can be used as a fast alternative to existing whole genome aligners. seq-seq-pan is freely available at https://gitlab.com/groups/rki_bioinformatics",

    "abstract": "RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) is currently the leading technology for genome-wide transcript quantification. While the volume of RNA-seq data is rapidly increasing, the currently publicly available RNA-seq data is provided mostly in raw form, with small portions processed non- uniformly. This is mainly because the computational demand, particularly for the alignment step, is a significant barrier for global and integrative retrospective analyses. To address this challenge, we developed all RNA-seq and ChIP-seq sample and signature search (ARCHS4), a web resource that makes the majority of previously published RNA-seq data from human and mouse freely available at the gene count level. Such uniformly processed data enables easy integration for downstream analyses. For developing the ARCHS4 resource, all available FASTQ files from RNA-seq experiments were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and aligned using a cloud-based infrastructure. In total 137,792 samples are accessible through ARCHS4 with 72,363 mouse and 65,429 human samples. Through efficient use of cloud resources and dockerized deployment of the sequencing pipeline, the alignment cost per sample is reduced to less than one cent. ARCHS4 is updated automatically by adding newly published samples to the database as they become available. Additionally, the ARCHS4 web interface provides intuitive exploration of the processed data through querying tools, interactive visualization, and gene landing pages that provide average expression across cell lines and tissues, top co-expressed genes, and predicted biological functions and protein-protein interactions for each gene based on prior knowledge combined with co-expression. Benchmarking the quality of these predictions, co-expression correlation data created from ARCHS4 outperforms co-expression data created from other major gene expression data repositories such as GTEx and CCLE.\\n\\nARCHS4 is freely accessible at: http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4",

    "abstract": "The efficiency of intracellular cargo transport from specific source to target locations is strongly dependent upon molecular motor-assisted motion along the cytoskeleton. Radial transport along microtubules and lateral transport along the filaments of the actin cortex underneath the cell membrane are characteristic for cells with a centrosome. The interplay between the specific cytoskeleton organization and the motor performance realizes a spatially inhomogeneous intermittent search strategy. In order to analyze the efficiency of such intracellular search strategies we formulate a random velocity model with intermittent arrest states. We evaluate efficiency in terms of mean first passage times for three different, frequently encountered intracellular transport tasks: i) the narrow escape problem, which emerges during cargo transport to a synapse or other specific region of the cell membrane, ii) the reaction problem, which considers the binding time of two particles within the cell, and iii) the reaction-escape problem, which arises when cargo must be released at a synapse only after pairing with another particle. Our results indicate that cells are able to realize efficient search strategies for various intracellular transport tasks economically through a spatial cytoskeleton organization that involves only a narrow actin cortex rather than a cell body filled with randomly oriented actin filaments.",

    "abstract": "Cell morphogenesis is a fundamental process involved in tissue formation. One of the challenges in the fabrication of living tissues in vitro is to recapitulate the complex morphologies of individual cells. Despite tremendous progress in understanding biophysical principles underlying tissue/organ morphogenesis at the organ level, little work has been done to understand morphogenesis at the cellular and microtissue level. In this work, we developed a 2D computational model for studying cell morphogenesis in monolayer tissues. The model is mainly composed of four modules: mechanics of cytoskeleton, cell motility, cell-substrate interaction, and cell-cell interaction. The model integrates the biochemical and mechanical activities within individual cells spatiotemporally. Finite element method (FEM) is used to model the irregular shapes of cells and to solve the resulting system of reaction-diffusion-stress equations. Automated mesh generation is used to handle the element distortion in FEM due to the large shape changes of the cells. The computer program can simulate tens to hundreds of cells interacting with each other and with the elastic substrate on desktop workstations efficiently. The simulations demonstrated that our computational model can be used to study cell polarization, single cell migration, durotaxis, and morphogenesis in cell monolayers.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRemarkable advances for clinical diagnosis and treatment in cancers including lung cancer involve cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) detection through next generation sequencing. However, before the sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA detection can be widely recognized, the consistency of mutations in tumor tissue and ctDNA should be evaluated. The urgency of this consistency is extremely obvious in lung cancer to which great attention has been paid to in liquid biopsy field.\\n\\nMethodsWe have developed an approach named systematic error correction sequencing (Sec-Seq) to improve the evaluation of sequence alterations in circulating cell-free DNA. Averagely 10 ml preoperative blood samples were collected from 30 patients containing pulmonary space occupying pathological changes by traditional clinic diagnosis. cfDNA from plasma, genomic DNA from white blood cells, and genomic DNA from solid tumor of above patients were extracted and constructed as libraries for each sample before subjected to sequencing by a panel contains 50 cancer-associated genes encompassing 29 kb by custom probe hybridization capture with average depth >40000, 7000, or 6300 folds respectively.\\n\\nResultsDetection limit for mutant allele frequency in our study was 0.1%. The sequencing results were analyzed by bioinformatic expertise based on our previous studies on the baseline mutation profiling of circulating cell-free DNA and the clinicopathological data of these patients. Among all the lung cancer patients, 78% patients were predicted as positive by ctDNA sequencing when the shreshold was defined as at least one of the hotspot mutations detected in the blood (ctDNA) was also detected in tumor tissue. Pneumonia and pulmonary tuberculosis were detected as negative according to the above standard. When evaluating all hotspots in driver genes in the panel, 24% mutations detected in tumor tissue (tDNA) were also detected in patients blood (ctDNA). When evaluating all genetic variations in the panel, including all the driver genes and passenger genes, 28% detected in tumor tissue (tDNA) were also detected in patients blood (ctDNA). Positive detection rates of plasma ctDNA in stage I lung cancer patients is 85%, compared with 17% of tumor biomarkers.\\n\\nConclusionWe demonstrated the importance of sequencing both circulating cell-free DNA and genomic DNA in tumor tissue for ctDNA detection in lung cancer currently. We also determined and confirmed the consistency of ctDNA and tumor tissue through NGS according to the criteria explored in our studies. Our strategy can initially distinguish the lung cancer from benign lesions of lung. Our work shows that the consistency will be benefited from the optimization in sensitivity and specificity in ctDNA detection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMendelian randomization has developed into an established method for strengthening causal inference and estimating causal effects, largely due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies. However, genetic instruments remain controversial as pleiotropic effects can introduce bias into causal estimates. Recent work has highlighted the potential of gene-environment interactions in detecting and correcting for pleiotropic bias in Mendelian randomization analyses.\\n\\nMethodsWe introduce MR using Gene-by-Environment interactions (MRGxE) as a framework capable of identifying and correcting for pleiotropic bias, drawing upon developments in econometrics and epidemiology. If an instrument-covariate interaction induces variation in the association between a genetic instrument and exposure, it is possible to identify and correct for pleiotropic effects. The interpretation of MRGxE is similar to conventional summary Mendelian randomization approaches, with a particular advantage of MRGxE being the ability to assess the validity of an individual instrument.\\n\\nResultsWe investigate the effect of BMI upon systolic blood pressure (SBP) using data from the UK Biobank and the GIANT consortium using a single instrument (a weighted allelic score).

    "abstract": "BackgroundMendelian randomization has developed into an established method for strengthening causal inference and estimating causal effects, largely due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies. However, genetic instruments remain controversial as pleiotropic effects can introduce bias into causal estimates. Recent work has highlighted the potential of gene-environment interactions in detecting and correcting for pleiotropic bias in Mendelian randomization analyses.\\n\\nMethodsWe introduce MR using Gene-by-Environment interactions (MRGxE) as a framework capable of identifying and correcting for pleiotropic bias, drawing upon developments in econometrics and epidemiology. If an instrument-covariate interaction induces variation in the association between a genetic instrument and exposure, it is possible to identify and correct for pleiotropic effects. The interpretation of MRGxE is similar to conventional summary Mendelian randomization approaches, with a particular advantage of MRGxE being the ability to assess the validity of an individual instrument.\\n\\nResultsWe investigate the effect of BMI upon systolic blood pressure (SBP) using data from the UK Biobank and the GIANT consortium using a single instrument (a weighted allelic score). We find MRGxE produces findings in agreement with MR Egger regression in a two-sample summary MR setting, however, association estimates obtained across all methods differ considerably when excluding related participants or individuals of non-European ancestry.

In addition, 36 whole pancreas were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) from subjects who were of similar age as the RIH patients and had not died of cancer. The primary exposure of interest was the measurement of the relative abundance of bacterial taxa in all tissue specimens using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\\n\\nResultsNumber of bacterial reads per sample varied substantially across sample type and patients, but all demonstrated the presence of diverse gastrointestinal bacteria, including bacterial taxa typically identified in the oral cavity. Bacterial profiles were noted to be more similar within individuals across sites in the pancreas, than between individuals by site, suggesting that the pancreas as a whole has its own microbiome. Comparing the mean relative abundance of bacterial taxa in pancreatic cancer patients to those without cancer revealed differences in bacterial taxa previously linked to periodontal disease, including Porphyromonas.\\n\\nConclusionsBacterial taxa known to inhabit the oral cavity, as well as the intestine, were identified in pancreatic tissue of cancer and non-cancer subjects. Whether any of these bacteria play a causal role in pancreatic carcinogenesis, or are simply opportunistic in nature, needs to be further examined.",

Our ~3.4 [A] cryo-EM structure reveals how the ATPases form a closed spiral staircase encircling an unfolded substrate, directing it toward the flat, symmetric protease ring. Importantly, the structure reveals how three coexisting nucleotide states allosterically induce distinct positioning of tyrosines in the central channel, resulting in substrate engagement and translocation to the negatively charged proteolytic chamber. This tight coordination by a network of conserved residues defines a sequential, around-the-ring ATP hydrolysis cycle that results in step-wise substrate translocation. Furthermore, we identify a hinge-like linker that accommodates the large-scale nucleotide-driven motions of the ATPase spiral independently of the contiguous planar proteolytic base. These results define the first molecular mechanism for a mitochondrial inner membrane AAA+ protease and reveal a translocation mechanism likely conserved for other AAA+ ATPases.",

    "abstract": "Secretagogin (SCGN) is poorly-studied secretory/cytosolic CaBP enriched in pancreatic {beta}-cells. Recent studies implicated SCGN in diabetes; however, its function and therapeutic prospect remain uncharted. Based on the apparent synchrony of SCGN and insulin secretion (and its disruption in HFD-fed animals) and considering SCGN downregulation in Type 2 diabetes, we hypothesized that SCGN is a key regulator of insulin response. To test this, we administered rSCGN to HFD-fed animals. We here report that a novel SCGN-insulin interaction stabilizes insulin and potentiates insulin action. Moreover, a chronic rSCGN administration improves insulin response and alleviates obesity associated risk factors such as weight gain, liver steatosis and cholesterol imbalance in DIO animals. Beside the anti-diabetic effects, prolonged rSCGN treatment also induces {beta}-cell regeneration. These effects seem to originate from SCGN mediated regulation of insulin concentration & function as validated in insulin-deficient STZ animals. Our results demonstrate the prospects of the therapeutic potential of SCGN against diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella, has been intensively studied due to its ability to evolve insecticide resistance and status as the worlds most destructive pest of brassicaceous crops. The surprise discovery of a cryptic ally, Plutella australiana Landry & Hebert, with apparent endemism to Australia, immediately raised questions regarding the extent of ecological and genetic diversity between these two species, whether gene flow could occur, and ultimately if specific management was required. Here, we show that despite sympatric distributions and the capacity to hybridize in controlled laboratory experiments, striking differences in genetic and phenotypic traits exist that are consistent with contrasting colonization histories and reproductive isolation after secondary contact. Almost 1500 Plutella individuals were collected from wild and cultivated brassicaceous plants at 75 locations throughout Australia. Plutella australiana was commonly found on all Brassica host types sampled except commercial vegetables, which are routinely sprayed with insecticide. Bioassays using four commonly-used insecticides found that P. australiana was 19-306 fold more susceptible than P. xylostella. Genome-wide SNPs derived from RADseq revealed substantially higher levels of genetic diversity across P. australiana compared with P. xylostella nuclear genomes, yet both species showed limited variation in mtDNA. Infection with a single Wolbachia subgroup B strain was fixed in P. australiana, suggesting that a selective sweep contributed to low mtDNA diversity, while a subgroup A strain infected just 1.5 % of P. xylostella. Although P. australiana is a potential pest of brassica crops, it is of secondary importance to P. xylostella.",

While this phenomenon has been amply documented using simple sensory-motor tasks, it is still unclear to what extent brain activations change on a short time scale when we are engaged in high level, complex tasks. Here, we examined this question using three types of high-level visual problems. We analyzed data from intracranial recordings performed in eight patients, focusing on the location and type of changes and on their relationship to overt behavior. Our results show significant repetition effects, manifested as signal decrease with repetition, in three different groups of electrodes: Visual sites, which increased their activity during stimuli presentation; Processing Positive sites, which demonstrated increased activity throughout the experimental trial; and Processing Negative sites, which demonstrated suppression of activity during the trial as compared to baseline. Interestingly, despite these significant repetition effects, response time remained unchanged with repetition. These findings bear directly upon our ability to interpret results aggregated across multiple repetitions of the same complex task.",

    "abstract": "Variability in neuronal responses to identical stimuli is frequently correlated across a population. Attention is thought to reduce these correlations by suppressing noisy inputs shared by the population. However, even with precise control of the visual stimulus, the subjects attentional state varies across trials. While these state fluctuations are bound to induce some degree of correlated variability, it is currently unknown how strong their effect is, as previous studies generally do not dissociate changes in attentional strength from changes in attentional state variability. We designed a novel paradigm that does so and find both a pronounced effect of attentional fluctuations on correlated variability at long timescales and attention-dependent reductions in correlations at short timescales. These effects predominate in layers 2/3, as expected from a feedback signal such as attention. Thus, significant portions of correlated variability can be attributed to fluctuations in internally generated signals, like attention, rather than noise.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic cells undergo genetic exchange between homologous chromosomes through programmed DNA double-strand break (DSB) formation, recombination and synapsis1, 2. In mice, the DNA damage-regulated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-like kinase (PIKK) ATM regulates all of these processes3-6. However, the meiotic functions of another major PIKK, ATR, have remained elusive, because germ line-specific depletion of this kinase is challenging. Using an efficient conditional strategy, we uncover roles for ATR in male mouse prophase I progression. Deletion of ATR causes chromosome axis fragmentation and germ cell elimination at mid pachynema. ATR is required for homologous synapsis, in a manner genetically dissociable from DSB formation. In addition, ATR regulates loading of recombinases RAD51 and DMC1 to DSBs and maintenance of recombination foci on synapsed and asynapsed chromosomes. Mid pachytene spermatocyte elimination in ATR deficient mice cannot be rescued by deletion of ATM and the third DNA damage-regulated PIKK, PRKDC, consistent with the existence of a PIKK-independent surveillance mechanism in the mammalian germ line. Our studies identify ATR as a multifunctional regulator of mouse meiosis.",

    "abstract": "Visual metacognition is the ability to employ confidence ratings in order to predict the accuracy of ones decisions about visual stimuli. Despite years of research, it is still unclear how visual metacognitive efficiency can be manipulated. Here we show that a hierarchical model of confidence generation makes a counterintuitive prediction: Higher sensory noise should increase metacognitive efficiency. The reason is that sensory noise has a large negative influence on the decision (where it is the only corrupting influence) but a smaller negative influence on confidence (where it is one of two corrupting influences; the other one being metacognitive noise). To test this prediction, we used a perceptual learning paradigm to decrease the amount of sensory noise. In Experiment 1, seven days of training led to significant decrease in noise as well as a corresponding decrease in metacognitive efficiency. Experiment 2 showed the same effect in a brief 97-trial learning for each of two different tasks. Finally, in Experiment 3, we experimentally manipulated stimulus contrast to increase sensory noise and observed a corresponding increase in metacognitive efficiency. Our findings demonstrate the existence of a robust positive relationship between sensory noise and metacognitive efficiency. These results could not be captured by a standard model in which decision and confidence judgments are made based on the same underlying information. Thus, our study provides a novel way to directly manipulate metacognitive efficiency and suggests the existence of metacognitive noise that corrupts confidence but not the perceptual decision.",

    "abstract": "To locomote stably, animals must coordinate volitional actions that change posture with opposing reflexes that hold posture constant [1-8]. These conflicting actions are thought to necessitate integrated control, in which reflexes are modulated to permit or even produce volitional movements [9-14]. Here we report that larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) utilize a simpler control scheme featuring independent volitional and reflexive movements. We present behavioral evidence that larvae swim in depth by appending destabilizing trunk rotations to steer with independent rotations to balance. When we manipulated buoyancy to deflect fish up or down, they redirected steering without coordinated changes to their balance reflex. As balance developed and increasingly opposed destabilization-mediated steering, larvae acquired compensatory use of their pectoral fins to steer. Removing the pectoral fins from older larvae impaired steering but preserved the strong balance reflex. Consequentially, older larvae without fins were strikingly less maneuverable -- unable to revert to destabilization-mediated steering -- revealing a rigidity inherent within the framework of independent volitional and reflexive control. Larval zebrafish therefore produce effective but inflexible locomotion by sequencing independent volitional and reflexive movements. These results reveal a simple control scheme, applicable for robotic design, that solves the general problem of coordinating volitional movements with the vital reflexes that oppose them.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) is a genetically and epigenetically regulated pre-mRNA processing to increase transcriptome and proteome diversity. Comprehensively decoding these regulatory mechanisms holds promise in getting deeper insights into a variety of biological contexts involving in AS, such as development and diseases. We assembled splicing (epi)genetic code, DeepCode, for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation by integrating heterogeneous features of genomic sequences, 16 histone modifications with a multi-label deep neural network. With the advantages of epigenetic features, DeepCode significantly improves the performance in predicting the splicing patterns and their changes during hESC differentiation. Meanwhile, DeepCode reveals the superiority of epigenomic features and their dominant roles in decoding AS patterns, highlighting the necessity of including the epigenetic properties when assembling a more comprehensive splicing code. Moreover, DeepCode allows the robust predictions across cell lineages and datasets. Especially, we identified a putative H3K36me3-regulated AS event leading to a nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of BARD1. Reduced BARD1 expression results in the attenuation of ATM/ATR signalling activities and further the hESC differentiation. These results suggest a novel candidate mechanism linking histone modifications to hESC fate decision. In addition, when trained in different contexts, DeepCode can be expanded to a variety of biological and biomedical fields.",

We utilized portable equipment, including the MinION DNA sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and miniPCR (miniPCR), to perform DNA extraction, PCR amplification and real-time DNA barcode sequencing of reptile specimens in the field. We demonstrate that nanopore sequencing can be implemented in a remote tropical forest to quickly and accurately identify species using DNA barcoding, as we generated consensus sequences for species resolution with an accuracy of >99% in less than 24 hours after collecting specimens. In addition, we generated sequence information at Universidad Tecnologica Indoamerica in Quito for the recently re-discovered Jambato toad Atelopus ignescens, which was thought to be extinct for 28 years, a rare species of blind snake Trilepida guayaquilensis, and two undescribed species of Dipsas snakes. In this study we establish how mobile laboratories and nanopore sequencing can help to accelerate species identification in remote areas (especially for species that are difficult to diagnose based on characters of external morphology), be applied to local research facilities in developing countries, and rapidly generate information for species that are rare, endangered and undescribed, which can potentially aid in conservation efforts.",

    "abstract": "Model-guided design has become a standard approach to engineering biomolecular circuits in current synthetic biology. However, the stochastic nature of biomolecular reactions is often overlooked in the design process. As a result, cell-cell heterogeneity causes unexpected deviation of biocircuit behaviors from model predictions and requires additional iterations of design-build-test cycles. To enhance the design process of stochastic biocircuits, this paper presents a computational framework to systematically specify the level of intrinsic noise using well-defined metrics of statistics and design highly heterogeneous biocircuits based on the specifications. Specifically, we use descriptive statistics of population distributions as an intuitive specification language of stochastic biocircuits and develop an optimization based computational tool that explores parameter configurations satisfying design requirements. Sensitivity analysis methods are also developed to ensure the robustness of a biocircuit design. These design tools are formulated using convex optimization programs to enable efficient and rigorous quantification of the statistics without approximation, and thus, they are amenable to the synthesis of stochastic biocircuits that require high reliability. We demonstrate these features by designing a stochastic negative feedback biocircuit that satisfies multiple statistical constraints. In particular, we use a rigorously quantified parameter map of feasible design space to perform in-depth study of noise propagation and regulation in negative feedback pathways.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-based synthetic sex ratio distorters, that operate by shredding the X-chromosome during male meiosis, are promising tools for the area-wide control of harmful insect pest or disease vector species. However, the selection of gRNA targets, in the form of high-copy sequence repeats on the X chromosome of a given species, is difficult since such repeats are not accurately resolved in genome assemblies and cant be assigned to chromosomes with confidence. We have therefore developed the redkmer computational pipeline, designed to identify short and highly-abundant sequence elements occurring uniquely on the X-chromosome. Redkmer was designed to use as input exclusively raw WGS data from males and females. We tested redkmer with suitable short and long read WGS data of An. gambiae, the major vector of human malaria, in which the X-shredding paradigm was originally developed. Redkmer establishes long reads as chromosomal proxies with excellent correlation to the genome assembly and uses them to rank X-candidate kmers for their level of X-specificity and abundance. Redkmer identified a high-confidence set of 25-mers, many of which belong to previously known X-chromosome specific repeats of An. gambiae, including the ribosomal gene array and the selfish genetics elements harbored within it. WGS data from a control strain in which these repeats are also present on the Y chromosome confirmed the elimination of these kmers in the filtering steps. Finally, we show that redkmer output can be linked directly to gRNA selection and can also inform gRNA off-target prediction. The redkmer pipeline is designed to enable the generation of synthetic sex ratio distorters for the control of harmful insect species of medical or agricultural importance. It proceeds from WGS input data to deliver candidate X-specific CRISPR gRNA candidate target sequences. In addition the output of redkmer, including the prediction of chromosomal origin of single-molecule long reads and chromosome specific kmers, could also be used for the characterization of other biologically relevant sex chromosome sequences, a task that is frequently hampered by the repetitiveness of sex chromosome sequence content.",

However, part of the difficulty in translating findings from mouse is that, despite high levels of gene conservation, regulatory control networks between human and mouse have been extensively rewired. To understand common themes of regulatory control we look beyond physical sharing of regulatory sequence, where extensive turnover of individual transcription factor binding sites complicates cross-species prediction of specific functions, and instead look at conserved properties of the regulatory code itself. We define regulatory conservation in terms of a grammar with shared, species-specific, and tissue-specific segments, and show that this grammar is more predictive of shared chromatin states and gene expression profiles than shared occupancy alone. Furthermore, we demonstrate a marked enrichment of disease associated variation in conserved grammatical patterns. These findings offer new understanding of transcriptional regulatory mechanisms shared between human and mouse.",

The accuracy of inference depends on the fidelity with which behaviorally-relevant properties of stimuli are encoded in neural responses. High-fidelity encodings can be metabolically costly, but low-fidelity encodings can cause errors in inference. Here, we discuss general principles that underlie the tradeoff between encoding cost and inference error. We then derive adaptive encoding schemes that dynamically navigate this tradeoff. These optimal encodings tend to increase the fidelity of the neural representation following a change in the stimulus distribution, and reduce fidelity for stimuli that originate from a known distribution. We predict dynamical signatures of such encoding schemes and demonstrate how known phenomena, such as burst coding and firing rate adaptation, can be understood as hallmarks of optimal coding for accurate inference.",

We propose a unified, quantitative framework whereby the attractor velocity input represents a multisensory self-motion estimate computed through an internal model that uses sensory prediction error based on vestibular, visual, and somatosensory cues to improve on-line motor drive. We show how context-dependent strength of recurrent connections within the attractor itself, rather than the self-motion input, explain differences in head direction cell firing between free foraging and restrained movements. We also summarize recent findings on how head tilt relative to gravity influences the azimuth coding of head direction cells, and explain why and how these effects reflect an updating self-motion velocity drive that is not purely egocentric. Finally, we highlight recent findings that the internal compass may be three-dimensional and hypothesize that the additional vertical degrees of freedom are defined based on global allocentric gravity cues.",

    "abstract": "Several fMRI and EEG studies have demonstrated that successful episodic retrieval is accompanied by the reactivation of cortical regions that were active during encoding. These findings are consistent with influential models of episodic memory that posit that conscious retrieval (recollection) relies on hippocampally-mediated cortical reinstatement. Evidence of reactivation corresponding to episodic information that is beyond conscious awareness at the time of memory retrieval, however, is limited. A recent exception is from an EEG study by Wimber, Maa{beta}, Staudigl, Richardson-Klavehn, and Hanslmayr (2012) in which words were encoded in the context of highly salient visual flicker entrainment and then presented at retrieval in the absence of any flicker. In that study, coherent (phase-locked) neural activity was observed at the corresponding entrained frequencies during retrieval, consistent with the notion that encoding representations were reactivated. Given the important implications of unconscious reactivation to past findings and the modeling literature, the current study set out to provide a direct replication of the previous study. Additionally, an attempt was made to extend such findings to intentional retrieval by acquiring EEG while subjects were explicitly asked to make memory judgments about the flicker frequency from encoding. Throughout a comprehensive set of analyses, the current study consistently failed to demonstrate evidence for unconscious reactivation, and instead provided support that test items were indistinguishable according to their prior encoding context. The findings thus establish an important boundary condition for the involvement of cortical reinstatement in episodic memory.",

Here we simultaneously examined oligomerization and activation of all three endogenous UPR sensors. We found that UPR sensors existed as preformed oligomers even in unstressed cells, which shifted to large oligomers for PERK and small oligomers for ATF6, but little changed for IRE1 upon ER stress. Neither depletion nor overexpression of BiP had significant effects on oligomeric complexes of UPR sensors both in unstressed and stressed cells.

Members of the ARF small GTPase family regulate membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal assembly in many cells. We identified ELMOD1, a guanine nucleoside triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) for ARF6, as the most highly enriched ARF regulator in hair cells. To characterize ELMOD1 control of trafficking, we used a mouse strain lacking functional ELMOD1 (roundabout; rda). In rda/rda mice, cuticular plates of utricle hair cells initially formed normally, then degenerated after postnatal day 5 (P5); large numbers of vesicles invaded the compromised cuticular plate. Hair bundles initially developed normally, but the cells apical membrane lifted away from the cuticular plate, and stereocilia elongated and fused. Membrane trafficking in type I hair cells, measured by FM1-43 dye labeling, was altered in rda/rda mice. Consistent with the proposed GAP role for ELMOD1, the ARF6 GTP/GDP ratio was significantly elevated in rda/rda utricles as compared to controls, and the level of ARF6-GTP was correlated with the severity of the rda/rda phenotype. These results suggest that conversion of ARF6 to its GDP-bound form is necessary for final stabilization of the hair bundle.\\n\\nSignificance StatementAssembly of the mechanically sensitive hair bundle of sensory hair cells requires growth and reorganization of apical actin and membrane structures. Hair bundles and apical membranes in mice with mutations in the Elmod1 gene degenerate after formation, suggesting that the ELMOD1 protein stabilizes these structures. We show that ELMOD1 is a GTPase-activating protein in hair cells for the small GTP-binding protein ARF6, known to participate in actin assembly and membrane trafficking. We propose that conversion of ARF6 into the GDP-bound form in the apical domain of hair cells is essential for stabilizing apical actin structures like the hair bundle and ensuring that the apical membrane forms appropriately around the stereocilia.",

Circulating microRNA-122 (miRNA-122), high-mobility group box1 (HMGB1), full-length keratin-18 (flk-18) and caspase-cleaved keratin-18 (cck-18) are established hepatocyte injury biomarkers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the discriminatory power of these biomarkers in plasma to identify potential biliary complications that may require acute intervention.\\n\\nMethodAn observational biomarker cohort study was carried out in a University teaching hospital for 12 months beginning 3rd September 2014. Blood samples were collected from adults referred with acute biliary-type symptoms. miRNA-122 was measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and HMGB1, cck-18 and flk-18 by ELISA.\\n\\nResults300 patients were screened and 289 patients were included. Plasma miRNA-122, cck-18 and flk-18 concentrations were increased in patients with gallstones compared to those without (miRNA-122: median: 2.89 x 104 copies/ml vs. 0.95 x 104 copies/ml [P<0.001]; cck-18: 121.9 U/L vs. 104.6 U/L [P = 0.041]; flk-18: 252.4 U/L vs. 151.8 U/L [P<0.001]). Uncomplicated gallstone disease was associated with higher miRNA-122 and cck-18 concentrations than complicated disease (miRNA-122: 5.72 x 104 copies/ml vs. 2.26x104 copies/ml [P=0.022]; cck-18: 139.7 U/L vs. 111.4 U/L [P=0.049]). There was no significant difference in HMGB1 concentration between patients with and without gallstones [P=0.480]. Separation between groups for all biomarkers was modest.\\n\\nConclusionmicroRNA-122 and keratin-18 plasma concentrations are elevated in patients with gallstones.

Here, we present Selenzyme, a free online enzyme selection tool for metabolic pathway design. The user is guided through several decision steps in order to shortlist the best candidates for a given pathway step. The tool graphically presents key information about enzymes based on existing databases and tools such as: similarity of sequences and of catalyzed reactions; phylogenetic distance between source organism and intended host species; multiple alignment highlighting conserved regions, predicted catalytic site, and active regions; and relevant properties such as predicted solubility and transmembrane regions. Selenzyme provides bespoke sequence selection for automated workflows in biofoundries. The tool is integrated as part of the pathway design stage into the design-build-test-learn SYNBIOCHEM pipeline.

    "abstract": "When defining bacterial populations through whole genome sequencing (WGS) the samples often have detailed associated metadata that relate to disease severity, antimicrobial resistance, or even rare biochemical traits. When comparing these bacterial populations, it is apparent that some of these phenotypes do not follow the phylogeny of the host i.e. they are genetically unlinked to the evolutionary history of the host bacterium. One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the genes are moving independently between hosts and are likely associated with mobile genetic elements (MGE). However, identifying the element that is associated with these traits can be complex if the starting point is short read WGS data. With the increased use of next generation WGS in routine diagnostics, surveillance and epidemiology a vast amount of short read data is available and these types of associations are relatively unexplored. One way to address this would be to perform assembly de novo of the whole genome read data, including its MGEs. However, MGEs are often full of repeats and can lead to fragmented consensus sequences. Deciding which sequence is part of the chromosome, and which is part of a MGE can be ambiguous. We present PlasmidTron, which utilises the phenotypic data normally available in bacterial population studies, such as antibiograms, virulence factors, or geographic information, to identify sequences that are likely to represent MGEs linked to the phenotype. Given a set of reads, categorised into cases (showing the phenotype) and controls (phylogenetically related but phenotypically negative), PlasmidTron can be used to assemble de novo reads from each sample linked by a phenotype. A k-mer based analysis is performed to identify reads associated with a phylogenetically unlinked phenotype. These reads are then assembled de novo to produce contigs. By utilising k-mers and only assembling a fraction of the raw reads, the method is fast and scalable to large datasets. This approach has been tested on plasmids, because of their contribution to important pathogen associated traits, such as AMR, hence the name, but there is no reason why this approach cannot be utilized for any MGE that can move independently through a bacterial population.

    "abstract": "Heat waves and droughts are a key risk to global crop production and quantifying the extent of this risk is essential for insurance assessment and disaster risk reduction. Here we estimate the cumulative production losses of six major commodity groups under both extreme heat and drought events, across 131 countries, over the time period of 1961-2014. Our results show substantial variation in national disaster risks that have hitherto gone unrecognised in regional and global average estimates. The most severe losses are represented by cereal losses in Angola (4.1%), Botswana (5.7%), USA (4.4%) and Australia (4.4%), oilcrop losses in Paraguay (5.5%), pulse losses in Angola (4.7%) and Nigeria (4.8%), and root and tuber losses in Thailand (3.2%). In monetary terms we estimate the global production loss over this period to be $237 billion US Dollars (2004-2006 baseline). The nations that incurred the largest financial hits were the USA ($116 billion), the former Soviet Union ($37 billion), India ($28 billion), China ($10.7 billion) and Australia ($8.5 billion USD). Our analysis closes an important gap in our understanding of the impacts of extreme weather events on global crop production and provides the basis for country relevant disaster risk reduction.",

    "abstract": "The analysis of hybridization and gene flow among closely related taxa is a common goal for researchers studying speciation and phylogeography. Many methods for hybridization detection use simple site pattern frequencies from observed genomic data and compare them to null models that predict an absence of gene flow. The theory underlying the detection of hybridization using these site pattern probabilities exploits the relationship between the coalescent process for gene trees within population trees and the process of mutation along the branches of the gene trees. For certain models, site patterns are predicted to occur in equal frequency (i.e., their difference is 0), producing a set of functions called phylogenetic invariants. In this paper we introduce HyDe, a software package for detecting hybridization using phylogenetic invariants arising under the coalescent model with hybridization. HyDe is written in Python, and can be used interactively or through the command line using pre-packaged scripts. We demonstrate the use of HyDe on simulated data, as well as on two empirical data sets from the literature. We focus in particular on identifying individual hybrids within population samples and on distinguishing between hybrid speciation and gene flow. HyDe is freely available as an open source Python package under the GNU GPL v3 on both GitHub (https://github.com/pblischak/HyDe) and the Python Package Index (PyPI: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/phyde).",

Here, ENCODE ChIP-seq identified 9,081 genomic sites specifically bound by NF90/110 in K562 cells. One third of binding sites occurred at promoters of annotated genes. NF90/110 binding colocalized with chromatin marks associated with active promoters and strong enhancers. Comparison with 150 ENCODE ChIP-seq experiments revealed that NF90 clustered with transcription factors exhibiting preference for promoters over enhancers (POLR2A, MYC, YY1). Differential gene expression analysis following shRNA knockdown of NF90 in K562 cells revealed that NF90 directly activates transcription factors that drive growth and proliferation (EGR1, MYC), while attenuating differentiation along erythroid lineage (KLF1). NF90/110 binds chromatin to hierarchically regulate transcription factors to promote proliferation and suppress differentiation.",

Knowledge of the cues that control formation of such repressive Polycomb domains is extremely limited. We exploited natural and engineered chromosomal rearrangements in the fungus Neurospora crassa to elucidate the control of H3K27me2/3. Analyses of H3K27me2/3 in strains bearing chromosomal rearrangements revealed both position-dependent and position-independent facultative heterochromatin. We found that proximity to chromosome ends is necessary to maintain, and sufficient to induce, transcriptionally repressive, subtelomeric H3K27me2/3. We ascertained that such telomere-proximal facultative heterochromatin requires native telomere repeats and found that a short array of ectopic telomere repeats, (TTAGGG)17, can induce a large domain ([~]225 kb) of H3K27me2/3. This provides an example of a cis-acting sequence that directs H3K27 methylation. Our findings provide new insight into the relationship between genome organization and control of heterochromatin formation.",

    "abstract": "Summary/AbstractGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) have laid the foundation for investigations into the biology of complex traits, drug development, and clinical guidelines. However, the dominance of European-ancestry populations in GWAS creates a biased view of the role of human variation in disease, and hinders the equitable translation of genetic associations into clinical and public health applications. The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study conducted a GWAS of 26 clinical and behavioral phenotypes in 49,839 non-European individuals. Using strategies designed for analysis of multi-ethnic and admixed populations, we confirm 574 GWAS catalog variants across these traits, and find 38 secondary signals in known loci and 27 novel loci. Our data shows strong evidence of effect-size heterogeneity across ancestries for published GWAS associations, substantial benefits for fine-mapping using diverse cohorts, and insights into clinical implications. We strongly advocate for continued, large genome-wide efforts in diverse populations to reduce health disparities.",

Although lncRNAs and mRNAs are similar in many ways, they differ with lncRNAs being more nuclear-enriched and in several cases exclusively nuclear7,8. Yet, the RNA-based sequences that determine nuclear localization remain poorly understood9-11. Towards the goal of systematically dissecting the lncRNA sequences that impart nuclear localization, we developed a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA). Unlike previous MPRAs12-15 that determine motifs important for transcriptional regulation, we have modified this approach to identify sequences sufficient for RNA nuclear enrichment for 38 human lncRNAs. Using this approach, we identified 109 unique, conserved nuclear enrichment regions, originating from 29 distinct lncRNAs. We also discovered two shorter motifs within our nuclear enrichment regions. We further validated the sufficiency of several regions to impart nuclear localization by single molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (smRNA-FISH). Taken together, these results provide a first systematic insight into the sequence elements responsible for the nuclear enrichment of lncRNA molecules.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis, the specialized cell division giving rise to gametes, numerous DNA doublestrand breaks (DSBs) are introduced at multiple places throughout the genome by the topoisomerase-like protein Spo11. Homologous recombination, a highly-conserved DSB repair pathway, is employed for their repair and ensures the formation of chiasmata and the proper segregation of homologous chromosomes. In the initial steps of recombination, end resection takes place, wherein Spo11 is endonucleolytically released and the 5'-terminal strands of each DSB are exonucleolytically processed, exposing the ssDNA necessary to identify a homologous repair template. DNA removed by DSB processing is reconstituted by DNA synthesis, which copies genetic information from the intact homologous template. We developed a next-generation sequencing assay, termed S1-seq, to study DNA end resection genome-wide at high spatial resolution during yeast meiotic recombination. The assay relies on the fact that removal of the ssDNA tails of resected DSBs marks the position where resection stopped. Molecular features of resection are revealed by sequencing of these ssDNA-to-dsDNA junctions and comparison to high-resolution Spo11 DSB maps. We describe the experimental and computational methods for S1-seq as applied to meiosis in the SK1 strain of budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and discuss how it can also be applied to map DSBs and recombination intermediates.",

    "abstract": "The nanoscale organization of neurotransmitter receptors relative to pre-synaptic release sites is a fundamental determinant of both the amplitude and reliability of synaptic transmission. How modifications in the alignment between pre- and post-synaptic machineries affect synaptic current properties has only been addressed with computer modeling, and therefore remains hypothetical. Using dual-color single molecule based super-resolution microscopy, we found a strong spatial correlation between AMPA receptor (AMPAR) nanodomains and the post-synaptic adhesion protein neuroligin-1 (NLG1). Expression of a C-terminal truncated form of NLG1 disrupted this correlation without affecting the intrinsic organization of AMPAR nanodomains. Moreover, this NLG1 dominant-negative mutant significantly shifted the pre-synaptic release machinery from AMPAR synaptic clusters. Electrophysiology and computer modeling show that this physical shift is sufficient to induce a significant decrease in synaptic transmission. Thus, our results suggest the necessity for synapses to release glutamate in front of AMPAR nanodomains, to maintain a high efficiency of synaptic responses.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal formation is involved in navigation, and its neuronal activity exhibits a variety of spatial correlates (e.g., place cells, grid cells). The quantification of the information encoded by spikes has been standard procedure to identify which cells have spatial correlates. For place cells, most of the established metrics derive from Shannons mutual information (Shannon, 1948), and convey information rate in bits/sec or bits/spike (Skaggs et al., 1993; Skaggs et al., 1996). Despite their widespread use, the performance of these metrics in relation to the original mutual information metric has never been investigated. In this work, using simulated and real data, we find that the current information metrics correlate less with the accuracy of spatial decoding than the original mutual information metric. We also find that the top informative cells may differ among metrics, and show a surrogate-based normalization that yields comparable spatial information estimates. Since different information metrics may identify different neuronal populations, we discuss current and alternative definitions of spatially informative cells, which affect the metric choice.",

Here, in our study of healthy human participants, we characterize two constraints on this learning process: the size of adaptive corrections is only related to error size when errors are smaller than 6{degrees}, and learning functions converge to a similar level of asymptotic learning over a wide range of error sizes. These findings are problematic for current models of sensorimotor adaptation, and point to a new theoretical perspective in which learning is constrained by the size of the error correction, rather than sensitivity to error.",

    "abstract": "Chemical biology approaches to the global functions of splicing reactions are gaining momentum, with an increasing repertoire of small molecule probes becoming available. Here we map the association of eIF4A3 with transcript expression, NMD and alternative splicing using a set of selective novel small molecule allosteric helicase inhibitors whose synthesis and chemical properties we have recently described. We show through analysis of dose monotonic transcriptional responses to increasing inhibition that both full length and NMD prone transcripts link eIF4A3 to normal functioning of cell division including chromosome segregation and cell cycle checkpoints, pointing to a conserved role of splicing and transcript quality processing in cell cycle functions. Cell cycle analysis and microscopy of inhibitor treated cells demonstrates chromosome mis-segregation and spindle defects, associated with a G2/M arrest, validating this observation. Through analysis of conserved alternative splicing patterns exhibiting monotonic responses, we find that eIF4A3 dependent alternative splicing involves exons that are longer and introns that are shorter than transcripts not modulated by eIF4A3. Moreover we observe conservation of over/under representation of RBP binding motif density over introns and exons implicated eIF4A3 modulated skipped exon and retained introns. The distribution of motif densities over 5 and branch intron sites and 5 exons is consistent with function of the exon-junction complex. Taken together we have defined a fraction of the transcrip-tome dependent on eIF4A3 functions and revealed a link between eIF4A3 and cell cycle regulation. The systems approach described here suggests additional avenues for therapeutic exploitation of eIF4A3 functions in cancer and related diseases.",

    "abstract": "In spite of all the efforts on deciphering such spinning process of spiders, the underlying mechanism currently is yet to be fully revealed. In this research, we designed a novel approach to quantitatively estimate the overall concentration change of spider silk along the progression of liquid-to-solid silk transition from the gland silk. As a prior characterization, we first studied the influence of silking-rate, ranged from 1.5 to 8.0 m/min, on spun fiber diameters as well as fiber strengths. Furthermore, the liquid contents of silk in the sac and the silk fibers leaving the spinneret were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and by estimating the ratio of collected dried silk to the weight loss of spider, respectively. The strength of spun silk fiber showed in the range of 7.5 - 8.5 g/denier; while, the fiber diameter of 0.7 - 1.1 deniers for spun silk first increased then decreased with take-up speed of winder. The results showed that the percentage liquid content of silk stored in the major ampullate sac (50.0 wt%) was lower than that of silk leaving the spinnerets (80.9 - 96.1 wt%), indicating a liquid supplying mechanism might be involved during the spinning process. Thus, a hypothesis of liquid coating on the outer surface of the silk thread served as a lubrication layer to reduce the silking resistance in spinning spigot of spider was proposed. In addition, we speculated the spigot serves as a valve-like regulator that controls not only the fiber diameter but also the lubrication layer. These findings provide understanding in physiological function of the spider spinning process and could further shed some light on future biomimetic development of silk material fabrication.",

Understanding these interactions requires a long-term view, especially to predict the consequences of climate change on parasite dynamics.\\nC_LIO_LIThe goal of this study is to evaluate temporal fluctuations in individual probability of infection, its environmental drivers and consequences for host body condition, of three malaria parasites (Plasmodium azurophilum, P. leucocytica, and P. floridense) infecting the lizard, Anolis gundlachi, in the rainforest of Puerto Rico.\\nC_LIO_LIWe conducted 13 surveys totaling N > 8000 lizards over 26 years. During the early years of the study, the lizards probability of infection by all three Plasmodium species appeared stable despite disturbances from short droughts and small to moderate hurricanes.\\nC_LIO_LIOver a longer timescale, we found that the individual lizard probability of infection and overall prevalence varied significantly over the years, and this fluctuation was driven in non-linear ways by variations in temperature and rainfall. The probability of infection was maximized at intermediate levels of temperature and precipitation. This temporal variability in Plasmodium prevalence driven by environmental factors had two important consequences. First, temperature-mediated a decrease in body condition in infected female lizards relative to non-infected ones. Second, Plasmodium parasite species composition varied through time.\\nC_LIO_LIOverall, the results show how environmental conditions, such a severe drought, can drive disease dynamics outside of their apparent stable equilibrium and mediate the potential negative effects of parasite infection on the host.

    "abstract": "A classic problem in population genetics is the characterization of discrete population structure in the presence of continuous patterns of genetic differentiation. Especially when sampling is discontinuous, the use of clustering or assignment methods may incorrectly ascribe differentiation due to continuous processes (e.g., geographic isolation by distance) to discrete processes, such as geographic, ecological, or reproductive barriers between populations. This reflects a shortcoming of current methods for inferring and visualizing population structure when applied to genetic data deriving from geographically distributed populations. Here, we present a statistical framework for the simultaneous inference of continuous and discrete patterns of population structure. The method estimates ancestry proportions for each sample from a set of two-dimensional population layers, and, within each layer, estimates a rate at which relatedness decays with distance. This thereby explicitly addresses the \\\"clines versus clusters\\\" problem in modeling population genetic variation. The method produces useful descriptions of structure in genetic relatedness in situations where separated, geographically distributed populations interact, as after a range expansion or secondary contact. We demonstrate the utility of this approach using simulations and by applying it to empirical datasets of poplars and black bears in North America.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOne of the first steps in the analysis of genetic data, and a principal mission of biology, is to describe and categorize natural variation. A continuous pattern of differentiation (isolation by distance), where individuals found closer together in space are, on average, more genetically similar than individuals sampled farther apart, can confound attempts to categorize natural variation into groups. This is because current statistical methods for assigning individuals to discrete clusters cannot accommodate spatial patterns, and so are forced to use clusters to describe what is in fact continuous variation. As isolation by distance is common in nature, this is a substantial shortcoming of existing methods. In this study, we introduce a new statistical method for categorizing natural genetic variation - one that describes variation as a combination of continuous and discrete patterns. We demonstrate that this method works well and can capture patterns in population genomic data without resorting to splitting populations where they can be described by continuous patterns of variation.",

    "abstract": "While studies such as the 1000 Genomes Projects have resulted in detailed maps of genetic variation in humans, to date there are few robust maps of epigenetic variation. We defined sites of common epigenetic variation, termed Variably Methylated Regions (VMRs) in five purified cell types. We observed that VMRs occur preferentially at enhancers and 3 UTRs. While the majority of VMRs have high heritability, a subset of VMRs within the genome show highly correlated variation in trans, forming co-regulated networks that have low heritability, differ between cell types and are enriched for specific transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways of functional relevance to each tissue. For example, in T cells we defined a network of 72 co-regulated VMRs enriched for genes with roles in T-cell activation; in fibroblasts a network of 21 coregulated VMRs comprising all four HOX gene clusters enriched for control of tissue growth; and in neurons a network of 112 VMRs enriched for roles in learning and memory. By culturing genetically-identical fibroblasts under varying conditions of nutrient deprivation and cell density, we experimentally demonstrate that some VMR networks are responsive to environmental conditions, with methylation levels at these loci changing in a coordinated fashion in trans dependent on cellular growth. Intriguingly these environmentally-responsive VMRs showed a strong enrichment for imprinted loci (p<10-94), suggesting that these are particularly sensitive to environmental conditions. Our study provides a detailed map of common epigenetic variation in the human genome, showing that both genetic and environmental causes underlie this variation.",

    "abstract": "It is often unavoidable to combine data from different sequencing centers or sequencing platforms when compiling datasets with a large number of individuals. However, the different data are likely to contain specific systematic errors that will appear as SNPs. Here, we devise a method to detect systematic errors in combined datasets. To measure quality differences between individual genomes, we study pairs of variants that reside on different chromosomes and co-occur in individuals. The abundance of these pairs of variants in different genomes is then used to detect systematic errors due to batch effects. Applying our method to the 1000 Genomes dataset, we find that coding regions are enriched for errors, where about 1% of the higher-frequency variants are predicted to be erroneous, whereas errors outside of coding regions are much rarer (<0.001%). As expected, predicted errors are less often found than other variants in a dataset that was generated with a different sequencing technology, indicating that many of the candidates are indeed errors. However, predicted 1000 Genomes errors are also found in other large datasets; our observation is thus not specific to the 1000 Genomes dataset. Our results show that batch effects can be turned into a virtue by using the resulting variation in large scale datasets to detect systematic errors.",

    "abstract": "All drug trials of the Alzheimers disease (AD) have failed to slow the progression of dementia in phase III studies, and the most effective therapeutic strategy remains controversial due to the poorly understood disease mechanisms. For AD drug design, amyloid beta (A{beta}) and its cascade have been the primary focus since decades ago, but mounting evidence indicates that the underpinning molecular pathways of AD are more complex than the classical reductionist models.\\n\\nSeveral genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently shed light on dark aspects of AD from a hypothesis-free perspective. Here, I use this novel insight to suggest that the amyloid cascade hypothesis may be a wrong model for AD therapeutic design. I review 23 novel genetic risk loci and show that, as a common theme, they code for receptor proteins and signal transducers of cell adhesion pathways, with clear implications in synaptic development, maintenance, and function. Contrary to the A{beta}-based interpretation, but further reinforcing the unbiased genome-wide insight, the classical hallmark genes of AD including the amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilins (PSEN), and APOE also take part in similar pathways of growth cone adhesion and contact-guidance during brain development. On this basis, I propose that a disrupted synaptic adhesion signaling nexus, rather than a protein aggregation process, may be the central point of convergence in AD mechanisms. By an exploratory bioinformatics analysis, I show that synaptic adhesion proteins are encoded by largest known human genes, and these extremely large genes may be vulnerable to DNA damage accumulation in aging due to their mutational fragility. As a prototypic example and an immediately testable hypothesis based on this argument, I suggest that mutational instability of the large Lrp1b tumor suppressor gene may be the primary etiological trigger for APOE/dab1 signaling disruption in late-onset AD.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the large gene instability hypothesis suggests that evolutionary forces of brain complexity have led to emergence of large and fragile synaptic genes, and these unstable genes are the bottleneck etiology of aging disorders including senile dementias. A paradigm shift is warranted in AD prevention and therapeutic design.\\n\\nGlossary",
