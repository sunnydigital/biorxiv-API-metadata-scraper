    "abstract": "In quantitative studies on animal movements and foraging, there has been ongoing debate over the relevance of Levy walk and related stochastic models to understanding mobility patterns of diverse organisms. In this study, we collected and analyzed a large number of GPS logs that tracked the movements of different livestock species in northwestern Kenya. Statistically principled analysis has only found limited evidence for the scale-free movement patterns of the Levy walk and its variants, even though most of the tracked movements clearly show super-diffusive behavior within the relevant temporal duration. Instead, the analysis has given strong support to composite exponential distributions (composite Brownian walks) as the best description of livestock movement trajectories in a wide array of parameter settings. Furthermore, this support has become overwhelming and near universal under an alternative criterion for model selection. These results illuminate the multi-scale and multi-modal nature of livestock spatial behavior. They also have broader theoretical and empirical implications for the related literature.",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation is commonly observed in nature: organisms perform well in their natal environment, but poorly outside it. Correlations between traits and latitude, or latitudinal clines, are among the most common pieces of evidence for local adaptation, but identifying the traits under selection and the selective agents is challenging. Here, we investigated a latitudinal cline in growth and photosynthesis across 16 populations of the perennial herb Erythranthe cardinalis (Phrymaceae). Using machine learning methods, we identify interannual variation in precipitation as a likely selective agent: Southern populations from more variable environments had higher photosynthetic rates and grew faster. We hypothesize that selection may favor a more annualized life history - grow now rather than save for next year - in environments where severe droughts occur more often. Thus our study provides insight into how species may adapt if Mediterranean climates become more variable due to climate change.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence of a \\\"set-point\\\" for body weight in the brain, that is regulated by the hypothalamus. This system modifies feeding behavior and metabolic rate, to keep body fat within predetermined parameters. It is also known that animals subjected to chronic centrifugation show a reduction in body fat. Experiments with mutant mice found that this loss of fat appears to be mediated by a vestibulo-hypothalamic pathway. Vestibular nerve stimulation (VeNS), also known as galvanic vestibular stimulation, involves non-invasively stimulating the vestibular system by applying a small electrical current between two electrodes placed over the mastoid processes. We suggest that any means of repeatedly stimulating the otolith organs in humans would cause a reduction in total body fat, and that VeNS would be a useful technique to use in this regard.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenotyping and whole-genome sequencing data have been collected in many cattle breeds. The compilation of large reference panels facilitates imputing sequence variant genotypes for animals that have been genotyped using dense genotyping arrays. Association studies with imputed sequence variant genotypes allow characterization of quantitative trait loci (QTL) at nucleotide resolution particularly when individuals from several breeds are included in the mapping populations.\\n\\nResultsWe imputed genotypes for more than 28 million sequence variants in 17,229 animals of the Braunvieh (BV), Fleckvieh (FV) and Holstein (HOL) cattle breeds in order to generate large mapping populations that are required to identify sequence variants underlying milk production traits. Within-breed association tests between imputed sequence variant genotypes and fat and protein percentages in milk uncovered between six and thirteen QTL (P<1e-8) per breed. Eight of the detected QTL were significant in more than one breed. We combined the association studies across three breeds using meta-analysis and identified 25 QTL including six that were not significant in the within-breed association studies. Closer inspection of the QTL revealed that two well-known causal missense mutations in the ABCG2 (p.Y581S, rs43702337, P=4.3e-34) and GHR (p.F279Y, rs385640152, P=1.6e-74) genes were the top variants at two QTL on chromosomes 6 and 20. Another true causal missense mutation in the DGAT1 gene (p.A232K, rs109326954, P=8.4e-1436) was the second top variant at a QTL on chromosome 14 but its allelic substitution effects were not consistent across three breeds analyzed. It turned out that the conflicting allelic substitution effects resulted from flaws in the imputed genotypes due to the use of a multi-breed reference population for genotype imputation.\\n\\nConclusionsMany QTL for milk production traits segregate across breeds. Metaanalysis of association studies across breeds has greater power to detect such QTL than within-breed association studies. True causal mutations can be readily detected among the most significantly associated variants at QTL when the accuracy of imputation is high. However, true causal mutations may show conflicting allelic substitution effects across breeds when the imputed sequence variant genotypes contain flaws. Validating the effect of known causal variants is highly recommended in order to assess the ability to detect true causal mutations in association studies with imputed sequence variant genotypes.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSeveral growth factors, cytokines, hormones activate PI3K/Akt pathway. Akt is a key node in this pathway and activates different downstream paths. One such path is Akt/mTORC1/S6K1 that controls protein synthesis, cell survival, and proliferation. Here we show that a negative feedback controls activation of S6K1 through this pathway. Due to this negative feedback, a sustained phospho-Akt signal generates a transient pulse of phospho-S6K1. We have created a mathematical model for this circuit. Analysis of this model shows that the negative feedback acts as a filter and preferentially allows a signal, with sharp and faster rise of phospho-Akt, to induce pronounced activation of S6K1. It blocks an input with a fast oscillation of phospho-Akt to flow through this path. We show that this negative feedback leads to differential activation of S6K1 by Insulin and Insulin-like Growth Factor 1. Such differential effect may explain the difference in the mitogenic effect of these two molecules.",

    "abstract": "A longstanding puzzle in human genetics is what limits the clinical manifestation of hundreds of hereditary diseases to certain tissues or cell types, while their causal genes are present and expressed throughout the human body. Here we considered a possible role for paralogs of causal genes in affecting this tissue selectivity. It has been shown across organisms that paralogs can compensate for the loss of each other. We hypothesized that specifically in the disease tissue causal genes and their paralogs are imbalanced, leading to insufficient compensation and to the emergence of disease phenotypes. While demonstrated previously in the context of few specific diseases, this hypothesis was never assessed quantitatively at large-scale. For this, we analyzed functional relationships between causal genes and their paralogs associated with 112 tissue-selective hereditary diseases. To test our hypothesis we used several large-scale omics datasets, including RNA sequencing profiles of over 30 different human tissues. Indeed, the expression of causal genes and their paralogs was significantly imbalanced in their disease tissues compared to unaffected tissues. Imbalanced expression was evident across different disease tissues, and was common to causal genes with single or multiple paralogs. This imbalance was driven by significant upregulation of the causal gene in its disease tissue, often combined with significant down-regulation of a paralog. Nevertheless, in additional 20% of the causal genes, a paralog alone was significantly down-regulated in the disease tissue. Our results suggest that dosage relationships between paralogs affect the phenotypic outcome of germline aberrations, adding paralogs as important modifiers of disease manifestation.",

    "abstract": "Some motor impairments associated with Parkinsons disease are thought to arise from pathological activity in the neuronal networks formed by the basal ganglia (BG) and motor cortex. To evaluate several hypotheses proposed to explain the emergence of pathological oscillations in Parkinsonism, we investigated changes to the directed connectivity in these networks following dopamine depletion. We recorded local field potentials in the cortex and basal ganglia of anesthetized rats rendered Parkinsonian by injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), with dopamine-intact rats as controls. We performed systematic analyses of the networks using a novel tool for estimation of directed neural interactions, as well as a conditioned variant which permits the analysis of the dependence of a connection upon a third reference signal. We find evidence of the dopamine dependency of both low beta (14-20 Hz) and high beta/low gamma (20-40 Hz) directed interactions within the BG and cortico-BG networks. Notably, 6-OHDA lesions were associated with enhancement of the cortical \\\"hyperdirect\\\" connection to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), as well the STNs feedback to the cortex and striatum. We find beta synchronization to be robust to conditioning using signals from any one structure. Conversely, we find that high beta/gamma drive from the cortex to subcortical regions is weakened by 6-OHDA lesions and is susceptible to conditioning. Furthermore, we provide evidence that gamma is routed from striatum in a pathway that is independent of STN. These results further inform our understanding of the substrates for pathological rhythms in salient brain networks in Parkinsonism.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe present a novel analysis of electrophysiological recordings in the cortico-basal ganglia network with the aims of evaluating several hypotheses concerning the origins of abnormal brain rhythms associated with Parkinsons disease. We present evidence for changes in the directed connections within the network following chronic dopamine depletion in rodents. These findings speak to the plausibility of a \\\"short-circuiting\\\" of the network that gives rise to the conditions from which pathological synchronization may arise.",

    "abstract": "PurposeIntensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has allowed optimization of three-dimensional spatial radiation dose distributions permitting target coverage while reducing normal tissue toxicity. However, radiation-induced normal tissue toxicity is a major contributor to patients quality of life and often a dose-limiting factor in the definitive treatment of cancer with radiation therapy. We propose the next logical step in the evolution of IMRT using canonical radiobiological principles, optimizing the temporal dimension through which radiation therapy is delivered to further reduce radiation-induced toxicity by increased time for normal tissue recovery. We term this novel treatment planning strategy \\\"temporally feathered radiotherapy\\\" (TFRT).\\n\\nMethodsTFRT plans were generated as a composite of five simulated treatment plans each with altered constraints on particular hypothetical organs at risk (OARs) to be delivered sequentially. For each of these TFRT plans, OARs chosen for feathering receive higher doses while the remaining OARs receive lower doses than the standard fractional dose delivered in a conventional fractionated IMRT plan. Each TFRT plan is delivered a specific weekday, which in effect leads to a higher dose once weekly followed by four lower fractional doses to each temporally feathered OAR. We compared normal tissue toxicity between TFRT and conventional fractionated IMRT plans by using a dynamical mathematical model to describe radiation-induced tissue damage and repair over time.\\n\\nResultsModel-based simulations of TFRT demonstrated potential for reduced normal tissue toxicity compared to conventionally planned IMRT. The sequencing of high and low fractional doses delivered to OARs by TFRT plans suggested increased normal tissue recovery, and hence less overall radiation-induced toxicity, despite higher total doses delivered to OARs compared to conventional fractionated IMRT plans. The magnitude of toxicity reduction by TFRT planning was found to depend on the corresponding standard fractional dose of IMRT and organ-specific recovery rate of sublethal radiation-induced damage.\\n\\nConclusionsTFRT is a novel technique for treatment planning and optimization of therapeutic radiotherapy that considers the non-linear aspects of tissue repair to optimize toxicity profiles. Model-based simulations of TFRT to carefully conceptualized clinical cases have demonstrated potential for normal tissue toxicity reduction in a previously described dynamical model of normal tissue complication probability (NTCP).",

    "abstract": "Short AbstractTraveling waves describe diverse natural phenomena from crystal growth in physics to range expansions in biology. Two classes of waves exist with very different properties: pulled and pushed. Pulled waves are driven by high growth rates at the expansion edge, where the number of organisms is small and fluctuations are large. In contrast, fluctuations are suppressed in pushed waves because the region of maximal growth is shifted towards the population bulk. Although it is commonly believed that expansions are either pulled or pushed, we found an intermediate class of waves with bulk-driven growth, but exceedingly large fluctuations. These waves are unusual because their properties are controlled by both the leading edge and the bulk of the front.\\n\\nLong AbstractEpidemics, flame propagation, and cardiac rhythms are classic examples of reaction-diffusion waves that describe a switch from one alternative state to another. Only two types of waves are known: pulled, driven by the leading edge, and pushed, driven by the bulk of the wave. Here, we report a distinct class of semi-pushed waves for which both the bulk and the leading edge contribute to the dynamics. These hybrid waves have the kinetics of pushed waves, but exhibit giant fluctuations similar to pulled waves. The transitions between pulled, semi-pushed, and fully-pushed waves occur at universal ratios of the wave velocity to the Fisher velocity. We derive these results in the context of a species invading a new habitat by examining front diffusion, rate of diversity loss, and fluctuation-induced corrections to the expansion velocity. All three quantities decrease as a power law of the population density with the same exponent. We analytically calculate this exponent taking into account the fluctuations in the shape of the wave front. For fully-pushed waves, the exponent is -1 consistent with the central limit theorem. In semi-pushed waves, however, the fluctuations average out much more slowly, and the exponent approaches 0 towards the transition to pulled waves. As a result, a rapid loss of genetic diversity and large fluctuations in the position of the front occur even for populations with cooperative growth and other forms of an Allee effect. The evolutionary outcome of spatial spreading in such populations could therefore be less predictable than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Initially identified as a factor involved in tyrosine kinase receptor signalling, GRB10-interacting GYF protein 2 (GIGYF2) has later been shown to interact with the 5 cap-binding protein m4EHP as part of a translation repression complex, and to mediate post-transcriptional repression of tethered reporter mRNAs. We recently observed that GIGYF2 also interacts with the miRNA-induced silencing complex and modulates its translation repression activity. Here we have further investigated how GIGYF2 represses mRNA function. In RNA tethering reporter assays we show that GIGYF2 exerts its action through a combination of translational repression and stimulated mRNA decay. Using truncation variants we identify two distinct effector domains within GIGYF2. In this assay GIGYF2-mediated repression is independent of m4EHP but dependent on the deadenylation activity of the CCR4/NOT complex. We further show that GIGYF2 interacts with multiple subunits of the CCR4/NOT complex and interestingly depletion of the CNOT1 scaffold subunit does not affect GIGYF2-mediated repression. Finally, we identify endogenous mRNA targets of GIGYF2 that recapitulate m4EHP - independent repression. Altogether, we propose that GIGYF2 has two distinct mechanisms of repression: one depends on m4EHP binding and affects translation, the other is m4EHP-independent and relies on the deadenylation activity of the CCR4/NOT complex.",

We identified aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and Glis family zinc finger 1 (GLIS1) as mesenchymal key TFs controlled by dynamic MSC-specific super-enhancers that become repressed in both lineages.

    "abstract": "Ecological mechanisms influence relationships among microbial communities, which in turn impact biogeochemistry. In particular, microbial communities are assembled by deterministic (e.g., selection) and stochastic (e.g., dispersal) processes, and the relative influence of these two process types is hypothesized to alter the influence of microbial communities over biogeochemical function, which we define generically to represent any biogeochemical reaction of interest. We used an ecological simulation model to evaluate this hypothesis. We assembled receiving communities under different levels of dispersal from a source community that was assembled purely by deterministic selection. The dispersal scenarios ranged from no dispersal (i.e., selection-only) to dispersal rates high enough to overwhelm selection (i.e., homogenizing dispersal). We used an aggregate measure of community fitness to infer its biogeochemical function relative to other communities. We also used ecological null models to further link the relative influence of deterministic assembly to function. We found that increasing rates of dispersal decrease biogeochemical function by increasing the proportion of maladapted taxa in a local community. Niche breadth was also a key determinant of biogeochemical function, suggesting a tradeoff between the function of generalist and specialist species. Together, our results highlight the influence of spatial processes on biogeochemical function and indicate the need to account for such effects in models that aim to predict biogeochemical function under future environmental scenarios.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe tropics harbor a large part of the worlds biodiversity and have a long history of human habitation. However, paleogenomics research in these climates has been constrained so far by poor ancient DNA yields. Here we compare the performance of two DNA extraction methods on ancient samples of teeth and petrous portions excavated from tropical and semitropical sites in Tanzania, Mexico, and Puerto Rico (N=12).\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsAll samples were extracted twice, built into double-stranded sequencing libraries, and shotgun sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2500. The first extraction protocol, Method D, was previously designed for recovery of ultrashort DNA fragments from skeletal remains. The second, Method H, modifies the first by adding an initial EDTA wash and an extended digestion and decalcification step.\\n\\nResultsNo significant difference was found in overall ancient DNA yields or post-mortem damage patterns recovered from samples extracted with either method, irrespective of tissue type. However, Method H samples had higher endogenous content and more mapped reads after quality-filtering, but also higher clonality. In contrast, samples extracted with Method D had shorter average DNA fragments.\\n\\nDiscussionBoth methods successfully recovered endogenous ancient DNA. But, since surviving DNA in ancient or historic remains from tropical contexts is extremely fragmented, our results suggest that Method D is the optimal choice for working with samples from warm and humid environments. Additional optimization of extraction conditions and further testing of Method H with different types of samples may allow for improvement of this protocol in the future.",

    "abstract": "Pigmentation has emerged as a premier model for understanding the genetic basis of phenotypic evolution, and a growing catalog of color loci is starting to reveal biases in the mutations, genes, and genetic architectures underlying color variation in the wild. However, existing studies have sampled a limited subset of taxa, color traits, and developmental stages. To expand our sample of color loci, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping analyses on two types of larval pigmentation traits that vary among populations of the redheaded pine sawfly (Neodiprion lecontei): carotenoid-based yellow body color and melanin-based spotting pattern. For both traits, our QTL models explained a substantial proportion of phenotypic variation and suggested a genetic architecture that is neither monogenic nor highly polygenic. Additionally, we used our linkage map to anchor the current N. lecontei genome assembly. With these data, we identified promising candidate genes underlying: (1) a loss of yellow pigmentation in Mid-Atlantic/northeastern populations (Cameo2 and apoLTP-II/I), and (2) a pronounced reduction in black spotting in Great-Lakes populations (yellow, TH, Dat). Several of these genes also contribute to color variation in other wild and domesticated taxa. Overall, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that predictable genes of large-effect contribute to color evolution in nature.",

    "abstract": "We present the most comprehensive catalogue of cancer-associated gene alterations through characterization of tumor transcriptomes from 1,188 donors of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project. Using matched whole-genome sequencing data, we attributed RNA alterations to germline and somatic DNA alterations, revealing likely genetic mechanisms. We identified 444 associations of gene expression with somatic non-coding single-nucleotide variants. We found 1,872 splicing alterations associated with somatic mutation in intronic regions, including novel exonization events associated with Alu elements. Somatic copy number alterations were the major driver of total gene and allele-specific expression (ASE) variation. Additionally, 82% of gene fusions had structural variant support, including 75 of a novel class called \\\"bridged\\\" fusions, in which a third genomic location bridged two different genes. Globally, we observe transcriptomic alteration signatures that differ between cancer types and have associations with DNA mutational signatures. Given this unique dataset of RNA alterations, we also identified 1,012 genes significantly altered through both DNA and RNA mechanisms. Our study represents an extensive catalog of RNA alterations and reveals new insights into the heterogeneous molecular mechanisms of cancer gene alterations.",
