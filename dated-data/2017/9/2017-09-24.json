    "abstract": "Trophic interactions are important determinants of the structure and functioning of ecosystems. As the metabolism and consumption rates of ectotherms increase sharply with temperature, there are major concerns that global warming will increase the strength of trophic interactions, destabilizing food webs, and altering ecosystem structure and function. We used geothermally warmed streams that span a [~]10{degrees}C temperature gradient to investigate the interplay between temperature-driven selection on traits related to metabolism and resource acquisition, and the interaction strength between the keystone gastropod grazer, the wandering snail Radix balthica, and a common algal resource. Populations from a warm stream ([~]28{degrees}C) had higher maximal metabolic rates and optimal temperatures than their counterparts from a cold stream ([~]17{degrees}C). We found that metabolic rates of the population originating from a warmer stream were higher across all measurement temperatures. A reciprocal transplant experiment demonstrated that the interaction strengths between the grazer and its algal resource were highest for both populations when transplanted into the warm stream. In line with the thermal dependence of respiration, interaction strengths of grazers from the warm stream were always higher than those of grazers from the cold stream. These findings suggest that warming can increase the strength of algal-grazer interactions through the thermodynamic effects of higher temperatures on physiological rates as well as through correlated increases in per capita metabolism and consumption.",

    "abstract": "The cardiovascular system facilitates body-wide distribution of oxygen, a vital process for development and survival of virtually all vertebrates. However, zebrafish, a vertebrate model organism, appears to form organs and survive mid-larval periods without the functional cardiovascular system. Despite such dispensability, it is the first organ to develop. Such enigma prompted us to hypothesize yet other cardiovascular functions that are important for developmental and/or physiological processes. Hence, systematic cellular ablations and functional perturbations are performed on zebrafish cardiovascular system to gain comprehensive and body-wide understanding of such functions and to elucidate underlying mechanisms. This approach identifies a set of organ-specific genes, each implicated for important functions. The study also unveils distinct cardiovascular mechanisms, each differentially regulating their expressions in organ-specific and oxygen-independent manners. Such mechanisms are mediated by organ-vessel interactions, circulation-dependent signals, and circulation-independent beating-heart-derived signals. Hence, a comprehensive and body-wide functional landscape of the cardiovascular system reported herein may provide a clue as to why it is the first organ to develop. Furthermore, the dataset herein could serve as a resource for the study of organ development and function.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTThe body-wide landscape of the cardiovascular functions during development is reported.

    "abstract": "Inbreeding depression is widely hypothesised to drive adaptive evolution of pre-copulatory and post-copulatory mechanisms of inbreeding avoidance, which in turn are hypothesised to affect evolution of polyandry (i.e., female multiple mating). However, surprisingly little theory or modelling critically examines selection for pre-copulatory or post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, or both strategies, given evolutionary constraints and direct costs, or examines how evolution of inbreeding avoidance strategies might feed back to affect evolution of polyandry. Selection for post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, but not for pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, requires polyandry, while interactions between pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance might cause functional redundancy (i.e.,  degeneracy) potentially generating complex evolutionary dynamics among inbreeding strategies and polyandry. We used individual-based modelling to quantify evolution of interacting pre-copulatory and post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and associated polyandry given strong inbreeding depression and different evolutionary constraints and direct costs. We found that evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance increased selection for initially rare polyandry, and that evolution of a costly inbreeding avoidance strategy became negligible over time given a lower cost alternative strategy. Further, fixed pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance often completely precluded evolution of polyandry and hence post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, but fixed post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance did not preclude evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance. Evolution of inbreeding avoidance phenotypes and associated polyandry are therefore affected by evolutionary feedbacks and degeneracy. All else being equal, evolution of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance and resulting low polyandry is more likely when post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance is precluded or costly, and evolution of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance greatly facilitates evolution of costly polyandry.",

    "abstract": "As the first line of defence against pathogens, cells mount an innate immune response, which is highly variable from cell to cell. The response must be potent yet carefully controlled to avoid self-damage. How these constraints have shaped the evolution of innate immunity remains poorly understood. Here, we characterise this programmes transcriptional divergence between species and expression variability across cells. Using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics in primate and rodent fibroblasts challenged with an immune stimulus, we reveal a striking architecture of the innate immune response. Rapidly diverging genes, including cytokines and chemokines, also vary across cells and have distinct promoter structures. Conversely, genes involved in response regulation, such as transcription factors and kinases, are conserved between species and display low cell-to-cell variability. We suggest that this unique expression pattern, observed across species and conditions, has evolved as a mechanism for fine-tuned regulation, to achieve an effective but balanced response.",

Wild-type Canton-S adult flies walked in one direction, counter-clockwise or clockwise, for minutes, whereas white-eyed mutant w1118 changed directions frequently. Locomotion in the circular arena could be classified into four components: counter-clockwise walking, clockwise walking, nondirectional walking and pausing. Genetic analysis revealed that while wild-type genetic background was associated with reduced directional change and reduced numbers of one-way (including counterclockwise and clockwise) and nondirectional walks, the white (w+) locus promoted persistent oneway walking by increasing the maximal duration of one-way episodes. The promoting effect of w+ was further supported by the observations that (1) w+ duplicated to the Y chromosome, (2) four genomic copies of mini-white inserted on the autosomes, and (3) pan-neuronal overexpression of the White protein increased the maximal duration of one-way episodes, and that RNAi knockdown of w+ in the neurons decreased the maximal duration of one-way episodes. These results suggested a pleiotropic function of w+ in promoting persistent one-way walking in the circular arena.",

    "abstract": "We gathered genomic data from grapes (Vitis vinifera ssp. vinifera), a clonally propagated perennial crop, to address three ongoing mysteries about plant domestication. The first is the duration of domestication; archaeological evidence suggests that domestication occurs over millennia, but genetic evidence indicates it can occur rapidly. We estimated that our wild and cultivated grape samples diverged ~22,000 years ago and that the cultivated lineage experienced a steady decline in population size (Ne) thereafter. The long decline may reflect low intensity management by humans prior to domestication. The second mystery is the identification of genes that contribute to domestication phenotypes. In cultivated grapes, we identified candidate-selected genes that function in sugar metabolism, flower development and stress responses. In contrast, candidate selected genes in the wild sample were limited to abiotic and biotic stress responses. A genomic region of high divergence corresponded to the sex determination region and included a candidate male sterility factor and additional genes with sex-specific expression. The third mystery concerns the cost of domestication. Annual crops accumulate putatively deleterious variants, in part due to strong domestication bottlenecks. The domestication of perennial crops differs from annuals in several ways, including the intensity of bottlenecks, and it is not yet clear if they accumulate deleterious variants. We found that grape accessions contained 5.2% more deleterious variants than wild individuals, and these were more often in a heterozygous state. Using forward simulations, we confirm that clonal propagation leads to the accumulation of recessive deleterious mutations but without decreasing fitness.\\n\\nSignificance StatementWe generated genomic data to estimate the population history of grapes, the most economically important horticultural crop in the world. Domesticated grapes experienced a protracted, 22,000 year population decline prior to domestication; we hypothesize that this decline reflects low intensity cultivation by humans prior to domestication. Domestication altered the mating system of grapes. The sex determination region is detectable as a region of heightened genetic divergence between wild and cultivated accessions. Based on gene expression analyses, we propose new candidate genes that alter sex determination. Finally, grapes contain more deleterious mutations in heterozygous states than their wild ancestors. The accumulation of deleterious mutations is due in part to clonal propagation, which shelters deleterious, recessive mutations.",

Hydrogen bonds (Hbonds) between N-cyclohexylmaleimide and the hydroxyl groups of cyclodextrins were suggested to play an important role in the catalysis.However, our free energy calculations and molecular dynamics simulations showed that these Hbonds are not stable, and quantum mechanics calculations suggested that the reaction is not promoted by these Hbonds. The binding of 9-anthracenemethanol and N-cyclohexylmaleimide to cyclodextrins was the key to the catalysis. Cyclodextrins act as a container to hold the two reactants in the cavity, pre-organizes them for the reactions, and thus reduces the entropy penalty to the activation free energy. Dimethyl-{beta}-CD was a better catalyst for this specific reaction than {beta}-CD because of its stronger van der Waals interaction with the pre-organized reactants and better performance in reducing the activation energy. This computational work sheds light on the mechanism of the catalytic reaction by cyclodextrins and introduces new perspectives of supramolecular catalysis.",

RecBCD helicase in prokaryotes initiates processive and rapid DNA unzipping essential for break repair.

Specifically, its essential to understand how RecBCD switches between its binding states to enable its translocation. Here we determine, by systematic affinity measurements, the degree of coupling between DNA and nucleotide binding to RecBCD. We show that, in the presence of ADP, RecBCD binds weakly to DNA that harbors a double overhang mimicking an unwinding intermediate. Consistently, RecBCD binds weakly to ADP in the presence of the same DNA. We did not observe coupling between DNA and nucleotide binding for DNA molecules having only a single overhang, suggesting that RecBCD subunits must both bind DNA to \"sense\" the nucleotide state. Excitingly, we observed weak coupling for AMPpNp as RecBCD remains strongly bound to DNA in its presence. Detailed thermodynamic analysis of RecBCD reaction mechanism suggests an  energetic compensation between RecB and RecD, which may be essential for rapid unwinding.

    "abstract": "Bacterial morphology is a complex trait that is highly sensitive to changes in the environment. For heterotrophic organisms, such as Escherichia coli, increases in nutrient levels are frequently accompanied by several-fold increases in both size and growth rate. Despite the dramatic nature of these changes, how alterations in nutrient availability translate into changes in growth and morphology remains a largely open question. To understand the signaling networks coupling nutrient availability with size and shape, we examined the impact of deletions in the entirety of non-essential central carbon metabolic genes on E. coli growth rate and cell size. Our data reveal the presence of multiple metabolic nodes that play important yet distinctive roles in shaping the cell. Consistent with recent work from our lab and others, although both are sensitive to nutrient availability, size and growth rate vary independently. Cell width and length also appear to be independent phenomena, influenced by different aspects of central carbon metabolism. These findings highlight the diversity of factors that can impact cell morphology and provide a foundation for further studies.\\n\\nAuthor summaryOften taken for granted, the shape of bacterial cells is a complex trait that is highly sensitive to environmental perturbations. Nutrients in particular, strongly impact bacterial morphology together with growth rate. The ubiquitous, rod-shaped bacteria Escherichia coli increases both length and width several fold upon a shift from nutrient poor to nutrient rich medium, a change accompanied by an equally dramatic increase in growth rate. Central carbon metabolism is an obvious site for the integration of nutrient dependent signals that dictate cell size and shape. To develop a clearer picture of the molecular mechanisms coupling nutrient assimilation with cell growth and morphology, we screened the entirety of nonessential carbon metabolic genes for their contribution to growth rate and cell shape. Our data reveal the presence of multiple regulatory circuits coordinating different metabolic pathways with specific aspects of cell growth and morphology. Together, these data firmly establish a role for central carbon metabolism as an environmentally sensitive sculptor of bacterial cells.",

    "abstract": "Speciation is a continuous process and analysis of species pairs at different stages of divergence provides insight into how it unfolds. Genomic studies on young species pairs have often revealed peaks of divergence and heterogeneous genomic differentiation. Yet it remains unclear how localised peaks of differentiation progress to genome-wide divergence during the later stages of speciation with gene flow. Spanning the speciation continuum, stickleback species pairs are ideal for investigating how genomic divergence builds up during speciation. However, attention has largely focused on young postglacial species pairs, with little known of the genomic signatures of divergence and introgression in older systems. The Japanese stickleback species pair, composed of the Pacific Ocean three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and the Japan Sea stickleback (G. nipponicus), which co-occur in the Japanese islands, is at a late stage of speciation. Divergence likely started well before the end of the last glacial period and crosses between Japan Sea females and Pacific Ocean males result in hybrid male sterility. Here we use coalescent analyses and Approximate Bayesian computation to show that the two species split approximately 0.68-1 million years ago but that they have continued to hybridise at a low rate throughout divergence. Population genomic data revealed that high levels of genomic differentiation are maintained across the majority of the genome when gene flow occurs. However despite this, we identified multiple, small regions of introgression, strongly correlated with recombination rate. Our results demonstrate that a high level of genome-wide divergence can establish in the face of persistent introgression and that gene flow can be localized to small genomic regions at the later stages of speciation with gene flow.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWhen species evolve, reproductive isolation leads to a build-up of differentiation in the genome where genes involved in the process occur. Much of our understanding of this comes from early stage speciation, with relatively few examples from more divergent species pairs that still exchange genes. To address this, we focused on Pacific Ocean and Japan Sea sticklebacks, which co-occur in the Japanese islands. We established that they are the oldest and most divergent known stickleback species pair, that they evolved in the face of gene flow and that this gene flow is still on going. We found introgression is confined to small, localised genomic regions where recombination rate is high. Our results show high divergence can be maintained between species, despite extensive gene flow.",

    "abstract": "With a few exceptions, the literature on evolutionary transitions in individuality (ETIs) has mostly focused on the relationships between lower-level (particle-level) and higher-level (collective-level) selection, leaving aside the question of the relationship between particle-level and collective-level inheritance. Yet, without an account of this relationship, our hope to fully understand the evolutionary mechanisms underlying ETIs is impeded. To that effect, I present a highly idealized model to study the relationship between particle-level and collective-level heritability both when a collective-level trait is a linear function and when it is a non-linear function of a particle-level trait. I first show that when a collective trait is a linear function of a particle-level trait, collective-level heritability is a by-product of particle-level heritability. It is equal to particle-level heritability, whether the particles interact randomly or not to form collectives. Second, I show that one effect of population structure is the reduction in variance in offspring collective-level character for a given parental collective. I propose that this reduction in variance is one dimension of individuality. Third, I show that even in the simple case of a non-linear collective-level character, collective-level heritability is not only weak but also highly dependent on the frequency of the different types of particles in the global population. Finally, I show that population structure, because one of its effects is to reduce the variance in offspring collective-level character, allows not only for an increase in collective-level character but renders it less context dependent. This in turns permits a stable collective-level response to selection. The upshot is that population structure is a driver for ETIs. These results are particularly significant in that the relationship between population structure and collective-level heritability has, to my knowledge, not been previously explored in the context of ETIs.",

    "abstract": "Cleavage Under Targets and Release Using Nuclease (CUT&RUN) is an epigenomic profiling strategy in which antibody-targeted controlled cleavage by micrococcal nuclease releases specific protein-DNA complexes into the supernatant for paired-end DNA sequencing. As only the targeted fragments enter into solution, and the vast majority of DNA is left behind, CUT&RUN has exceptionally low background levels. CUT&RUN outperforms the most widely-used Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocols in resolution, signal-to-noise, and depth of sequencing required. In contrast to ChIP, CUT&RUN is free of solubility and DNA accessibility artifacts and can be used to profile insoluble chromatin and to detect long-range 3D contacts without cross-linking. Here we present an improved CUT&RUN protocol that does not require isolation of nuclei and provides high-quality data starting with only 100 cells for a histone modification and 1000 cells for a transcription factor. From cells to purified DNA CUT&RUN requires less than a day at the lab bench.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy can revolutionize anti-cancer therapy if specific targets are available. Recurrent somatic mutations in the exome can create highly specific neo-antigens. However, especially pediatric cancers are oligo-mutated and hardly exhibit recurrent neo-antigens. Yet, immunogenic peptides encoded by cancer-specific genes (CSGs), which are virtually not expressed in normal tissues, may enable a targeted immunotherapy of such cancers. Here, we describe an algorithm and provide a user-friendly software named RAVEN (Rich Analysis of Variable gene Expressions in Numerous tissues), which automatizes the systematic and fast identification of CSG-encoded peptides highly affine to Major Histocompatibility Complexes (MHC) starting from publicly available gene expression data. We applied RAVEN to a dataset assembled from more than 2,700 simultaneously normalized gene expression microarrays comprising 50 tumor entities, with a focus on sarcomas and pediatric cancers, and 71 normal tissue types. RAVEN performed a transcriptome-wide scan in each cancer entity for gender-specific CSGs. As a proof-of-concept we identified several established CSGs, but also many novel candidates potentially suitable for targeting multiple cancer types. The specific expression of the most promising CSGs was validated by qRT-PCR in cancer cell lines and by immunohistochemistry in a comprehensive tissue-microarray comprising 412 samples. Subsequently, RAVEN identified likely immunogenic peptides encoded by these CSGs by predicting the affinity to MHCs. Putative highly affine peptides were automatically crosschecked with the UniProt protein-database to exclude sequence identity with abundantly expressed proteins. The predicted affinity of selected peptides was validated in T2-cell peptide-binding assays in which many showed similar kinetics to a very immunogenic influenza control peptide.\\n\\nCollectively, we provide a comprehensive, exquisitely curated and validated catalogue of cancer-specific and highly MHC-affine peptides across 50 cancer entities. In addition, we developed an intuitive and freely available software to easily apply our algorithm to any gene expression dataset (https://github.com/JSGerke/RAVENsoftware). We anticipate that our peptide libraries and software constitute a rich resource to accelerate the development of novel immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Despite motion on the retina with every saccade, we perceive the world as stable. But whether this stability is a result of neurons constructing a spatial map or continually remapping a retinal representation is unclear. Previous work has focused on the perceptual consequences of shifts in the horizontal and vertical dimensions, but torsion is another key component in ocular orienting that - unlike horizontal and vertical movements - produces a natural misalignment between spatial and retinal coordinates. Here we took advantage of oblique eye orientation-induced retinal torsion to examine perisaccadic orientation perception. We found that orientation perception was largely predicted by the retinal image throughout each trial. Surprisingly however, we observed a significant presaccadic remapping of the percept consistent with maintaining a stable (but spatially inaccurate) retinotopic perception throughout the saccade. These findings strongly suggest that our seamless perceptual stability relies on retinotopic signals that are remapped with each saccade.",

    "abstract": "In daily interactions, our sensorimotor system accounts for spatial and temporal discrepancies between the senses. Functional lateralization between hemispheres causes differences in attention and control of action. In addition, differences in transmission delays between modalities affects motor control. Studies on hemispatial neglect syndrome suggest a link between temporal processing and lateral spatial biases. To understand this link, we studied participants who performed lateral reaching, and adapted to delayed visual feedback in either left, right, or both workspaces. We tested transfer of adaptation to blind drawing, and found that adaptation to left or both delay caused selective leftward elongation. In contrast, adaptation to right delay caused elongation in both directions. Arm dynamics alone cannot explain these findings, but a model of a combined attentional-motor asymmetry across the hemispheres explains our observations. This suggests a possible connection between laterality in delay processing and motor performances observed in cases of hemispatial neglect.",

The menstrual cycle may contribute to symptom instability among females with this disorder.\\n\\nMethodsFifteen healthy, unmedicated females with BPD and without dysmenorrhea reported daily symptoms across 35 days. Urine luteinizing hormone (LH) and salivary progesterone (P4) were used to confirm ovulation and cycle phase. Cyclical worsening of symptoms was evaluated using (1) phase contrasts in multilevel models and (2) the Carolina Premenstrual Assessment Scoring System (C-PASS; Eisenlohr-Moul et al., 2017b), a protocol for evaluating clinically significant cycle effects on symptoms.\\n\\nResultsMost symptoms demonstrated midluteal worsening, a perimenstrual peak, and resolution of symptoms in the follicular or ovulatory phase. Post-hoc correlations with person-centered progesterone revealed negative correlations with most symptoms. Depressive symptoms showed an unexpected delayed pattern in which baseline levels of symptoms were observed in the ovulatory and midluteal phases, and exacerbations were observed during both the perimenstrual and follicular phases. The majority of participants met C-PASS criteria for clinically significant (>=30%) symptom exacerbation. All participants met the emotional instability criterion of BPD, and no participant met DSM-5 criteria for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).\\n\\nConclusionsFemales with BPD may be at elevated risk for perimenstrual worsening of emotional symptoms. Longitudinal studies with fine-grained hormonal measurement as well as hormonal experiments are needed to determine the pathophysiology of perimenstrual exacerbation in BPD.",

    "abstract": "Recent psychophysical and modeling studies have revealed that sensorimotor reference frame transformations (RFTs) add variability to motor output by decreasing the fidelity of sensory signals. How RFT stochasticity affects the sensory input underlying perceptual decisions, if at all, is unknown. To investigate this, we asked participants to perform a simple two-alternative motion direction discrimination task under varying conditions of head roll and/or stimulus rotation while responding either with a saccade or button press, allowing us to attribute behavioral effects to eye-, head- and shoulder-centered reference frames. We observed a rotation-induced, increase in reaction time and decrease in accuracy, indicating a degradation of motion evidence commensurate with a decrease in motion strength. Inter-participant differences in performance were best explained by a continuum of eye-head-shoulder representations of accumulated decision evidence, with eye- and shoulder-centered preferences during saccades and button presses, respectively. We argue that perceptual decision making and stochastic RFTs are inseparable, consistent with electrophysiological recordings in neural areas thought to be encoding sensorimotor signals for perceptual decisions. Furthermore, transformational stochasticity appears to be a generalized phenomenon, applicable throughout the perceptual and motor systems. We show for the first time that, by simply rolling ones head, perceptual decision making is impaired in a way that is captured by stochastic RFTs.\\n\\nSignificance statementWhen exploring our environment, we typically maintain upright head orientations, often even despite increased energy expenditure. One possible explanation for this apparently suboptimal behavior might come from the finding that sensorimotor transformations, required for generating geometrically-correct behavior, add signal- dependent variability (stochasticity) to perception and action. Here, we explore the functional interaction of stochastic transformations and perceptual decisions by rolling the head and/or stimulus during a motion direction discrimination task. We find that, during visuomotor rotations, perceptual decisions are significantly impaired in both speed and accuracy in a way that is captured by stochastic transformations. Thus, our findings suggest that keeping ones head aligned with gravity is in fact ideal for making perceptual judgments about our environment.",

However, neural evidence for such a time-locked process has been lacking. Here, we sought such evidence by using a computational model to quantify the meaning carried by each word based on how semantically dissimilar it was to its preceding context and then regressing this quantity against electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded from subjects as they listened to narrative speech. This produced a prominent negativity at a time-lag of 200- 600 ms on centro-parietal EEG electrodes. Subsequent EEG experiments involving time-reversed speech, cocktail party attention and audiovisual speech-in-noise demonstrated that this response was exquisitely sensitive to whether or not subjects were understanding the speech they heard. These findings demonstrate that, when successfully comprehending natural speech, the human brain encodes meaning as a function of the amount of new information carried by each word in a relatively time-locked fashion.",

    "abstract": "B-cell leukemia 11b (Bcl11b) is a zinc-finger transcription factor known as master regulator of T lymphocytes and neuronal development during embryogenesis. Bcl11b-interacting protein COUP-TFII is required for atrial development and vasculogenesis, however a role of Bcl11b in the adult cardiovascular system is unknown. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) recently showed that a gene desert region downstream of BCL11B and known to function as BCL11B enhancer harbors single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with increased arterial stiffness. Based on these human findings, we sought to examine relations between Bcl11b and arterial function using mice with Bcl11b deletion. We report for the first time that Bcl11b is expressed in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) and transcriptionally regulates the expression of VSM contractile proteins smooth muscle myosin and smooth muscle -actin. Lack of Bcl11b in VSM-specific Bcl11b null mice (BSMKO) resulted in increased expression of Ca++-calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin in BSMKO VSM cells, cultured in serum-free condition, and in BSMKO aortas, which showed an inverse correlation with levels of phosphorylated VASPS239, a regulator of cytoskeletal actin rearrangements. Moreover, decreased pVASPS239 in BSMKO aortas was associated with increased actin polymerization (F/G actin ratio). Functionally, aortic force, stress and wall tension, measured ex vivo in organ baths, were increased in BSMKO aortas and BSMKO mice had increased pulse wave velocity, the in vivo index of arterial stiffness, compared to WT littermates. Despite having no effect on baseline blood pressure or angiotensin II-induced hypertension, Bcl11b deletion in VSM increased the incidence of aortic aneurysms in BSMKO mice. Aneurysmal aortas from angII-treated BSMKO mice had increased number of apoptotic VSM cells. In conclusion, we identified VSM Bcl11b as a novel and crucial regulator of VSM cell phenotype and vascular structural and functional integrity.",

    "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions, also called side effects, range from mild to fatal clinical events and significantly affect the quality of care. Among other causes, side effects occur when drugs bind to proteins other than their intended target. As experimentally testing drug specificity against the entire proteome is out of reach, we investigate the application of chemogenomics approaches. We formulate the study of drug specificity as a problem of predicting interactions between drugs and proteins at the proteome scale. We build several benchmark datasets, and propose NN-MT, a multi-task Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm that is trained on a limited number of data points, in order to solve the computational issues or proteome-wide SVM for chemogenomics. We compare NN-MT to different state-of-the-art methods, and show that its prediction performances are similar or better, at an efficient calculation cost. Compared to its competitors, the proposed method is particularly efficient to predict (protein, ligand) interactions in the difficult double-orphan case, i.e. when no interactions are previously known for the protein nor for the ligand. The NN-MT algorithm appears to be a good default method providing state-of-the-art or better performances, in a wide range of prediction scenarii that are considered in the present study: proteome-wide prediction, protein family prediction, test (protein, ligand) pairs dissimilar to pairs in the train set, and orphan cases.",

In vitro, motion of nucleosome arrays can be accurately modeled by assuming a Kuhn length of 35-55 nm. In vivo, the amplitude of chromosome fluctuations is drastically reduced, and depends on transcription. Transcription activation increases chromatin dynamics only if it involves gene relocalization, while global transcriptional inhibition augments the fluctuations, yet without relocalization. Chromatin fiber motion is accounted for by a model of equilibrium fluctuations of a polymer chain, in which random contacts along the chromosome contour induce an excess of internal friction. Simulations that reproduce chromosome conformation capture and imaging data corroborate this hypothesis. This model unravels the transient nature of chromosome contacts, characterized by a life time of [~]2 seconds and a free energy of formation of [~]1 kBT.",

    "abstract": "The structural organization of the condensed chromosomes is being revealed using chromosome conformation capture experiments and super-resolution imaging techniques. Fingerprints of their three-dimensional organization on length scale from about hundred kilo base pairs to millions of base pairs have emerged using advances in Hi-C and super-resolution microscopy. To determine the poorly understood dynamics of human interphase chromosomes, we created the Chromosome Copolymer Model (CCM) by representing the chromosomes as a self-avoiding polymer with two loci types corresponding to euchromatin and heterochromatin. Using advanced clustering algorithms we establish quantitatively that the simulated contact maps for chromosomes 5 and 10 and those inferred from Hi-C experiments are in agreement. Ward Linkage Matrix (WLM), constructed from spatial distance information, shows that the Topologically Associated Domains (TADs) and compartments predicted from simulations are in agreement with inferred WLM computed using data from super-resolution microscopy experiments. Glassy dynamics is manifested in the stretched exponential relaxation of the structure factor and caging in the mean square displacement of individual loci, {triangleup}i(t) [~] t with 0 <  < 1. Remarkably, the distribution of , is extremely broad suggestive of highly heterogeneous dynamics, which is also reflected in the large cell-to-cell variations in the contact maps. Chromosome organization is hierarchical involving the formation of chromosome droplets (CDs) on short genomic scale followed by coalescence of the CDs, reminiscent of Ostwald ripening. We propose that glassy landscapes for the condensed active chromosomes might provide a balance between genomic conformational stability and biological functions.",

    "abstract": "Rising use of heroin and prescription opioids are major contributors to increases in Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) incidence in US young adults since the late 1990s. How best to interrupt transmission and decrease HCV prevalence in young persons who inject drugs (PWID) is uncertain, but modeling studies in older populations support interventions that increase HCV treatment among all PWID. We developed a transmission model of young (aged 15-30 years) PWID, which we fit to state-level US HCV surveillance data, and simulated the potential impact of primary (reducing injection initiation), secondary (increasing cessation, reducing injection partners, or reducing injection drug use relapse), and tertiary (HCV treatment) interventions on incident and prevalent HCV cases. Interventions with primary prevention initiatives (reducing injection initiation) yielded concurrent reductions to HCV incidence and prevalence. Treatment of former PWID led to prevalence reductions but did not reduce incidence. Treatment of current and former PWID without other interventions led to incidence reductions in scenarios with high injection initiation rates, high syringe sharing, and low relapse rates after injection cessation. While these results are specific to Michigan, our approach could be applied in other states conducting HCV surveillance to identify local-level intervention opportunities.",
