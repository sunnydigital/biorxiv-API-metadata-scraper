    "abstract": "The RET tyrosine kinase signaling pathway is involved in the development of endocrine resistant ER+ breast cancer. However, the expression of the RET receptor itself has not been directly linked to clinical cases of resistance, suggesting that additional factors are involved. We show that both ER+ endocrine resistant and sensitive breast cancers have functional RET tyrosine kinase signaling pathway, but that endocrine sensitive breast cancer cells lack RET ligands that are necessary to drive endocrine resistance. Transcription of one RET ligand, GDNF, is necessary and sufficient to confer resistance in the ER+ MCF-7 cell line. In patients, RET ligand expression predicts responsiveness to endocrine therapies and correlates with survival. Collectively, our findings show that ER+ tumor cells are \\\"poised\\\" for RET mediated endocrine resistance, expressing all components of the RET signaling pathway, but endocrine sensitive cells lack high expression of RET ligands that are necessary to initiate the resistance phenotype.",

We designed and evaluated four quantitative PCR assays for the detection of environmental DNA from five Alaskan fish species present on the North Slope of Alaska: burbot (Lota lota), arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus), Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), arctic grayling (Thymallus arcticus), and slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus). All assays were designed and tested for species specificity and sensitivity, and all assays detected target species from filtered water samples collected from the field. These assays will enable efficient and economical detection and monitoring of these species in lakes and rivers. This in turn will provide managers with improved knowledge of current distributions and future range shifts associated with climate and development threats, enabling more timely management.",

    "abstract": "Translation rate per mRNA molecule correlates positively with mRNA abundance. As a result, protein levels do not scale linearly with mRNA levels, but instead scale with the abundance of mRNA raised to the power of an \\\"amplification exponent\\\". Here we show that to quantitate translational control, the translation rate must be decomposed into two components. One, TRmD, depends on the mRNA level and defines the amplification exponent. The other, TRmIND, is independent of mRNA amount and impacts the correlation coefficient between protein and mRNA levels. We show that in S. cerevisiae TRmD represents [~]20% of the variance in translation and directs an amplification exponent of 1.20 with a 95% confidence interval [1.14, 1.26]. TRmIND constitutes the remaining [~]80% of the variance in translation and explains [~]5% of the variance in protein expression. We also find that TRmD and TRmIND are preferentially determined by different mRNA sequence features: TRmIND by the length of the open reading frame and TRmD both by a [~]60 nucleotide element that spans the initiating AUG and by codon and amino acid frequency. Our work provides more appropriate estimates of translational control and implies that TRmIND is under different evolutionary selective pressures than TRmD.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian X and Y chromosomes evolved from an ordinary autosomal pair. Genetic decay of the Y led to X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in females, but some Y-linked genes were retained during the course of sex chromosome evolution, and many X-linked genes did not become subject to XCI. We reconstructed gene-by-gene dosage sensitivities on the ancestral autosomes through phylogenetic analysis of microRNA (miRNA) target sites and compared these preexisting characteristics to the current status of Y-linked and X-linked genes in mammals. Preexisting heterogeneities in dosage sensitivity, manifesting as differences in the extent of miRNA-mediated repression, predicted either the retention of a Y homolog or the acquisition of XCI following Y gene decay. Analogous heterogeneities among avian Z-linked genes predicted either the retention of a W homolog or gene-specific dosage compensation following W gene decay. Genome-wide analyses of human copy number variation indicate that these heterogeneities consisted of sensitivity to both increases and decreases in dosage. We propose a model of XY/ZW evolution incorporating such preexisting dosage sensitivities in determining the evolutionary fates of individual genes. Our findings thus provide a more complete view of the role of dosage sensitivity in shaping the mammalian and avian sex chromosomes, and reveal an important role for post-transcriptional regulatory sequences (miRNA target sites) in sex chromosome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Geographically separated populations can convergently adapt to the same selection pressure. Convergent evolution at the level of a gene may arise via three distinct modes. The selected alleles can (1) have multiple independent mutational origins, (2) be shared due to shared ancestral standing variation, or (3) spread throughout subpopulations via gene flow. We present a model-based, statistical approach that utilizes genomic data to detect cases of convergent adaptation at the genetic level, identify the loci involved and distinguish among these modes. To understand the impact of convergent positive selection on neutral diversity at linked loci, we make use of the fact that hitchhiking can be modeled as an increase in the variance in neutral allele frequencies around a selected site within a population. We build on coalescent theory to show how shared hitchhiking events between subpopulations act to increase covariance in allele frequencies between subpopulations at loci near the selected site, and extend this theory under different models of migration and selection on the same standing variation. We incorporate this hitchhiking effect into a multivariate normal model of allele frequencies that also accounts for population structure. Based on this theory, we present a composite-likelihood-based approach that utilizes genomic data to identify loci involved in convergence, and distinguishes among alternate modes of convergent adaptation. We illustrate our method on genome-wide polymorphism data from two distinct cases of convergent adaptation. First, we investigate the adaptation for copper toxicity tolerance in two populations of the common yellow monkey flower, Mimulus guttatus. We show that selection has occurred on an allele that has been standing in these populations prior to the onset of copper mining in this region. Lastly, we apply our method to data from four populations of the killifish, Fundulus heteroclitus, that show very rapid convergent adaptation for tolerance to industrial pollutants. Here, we identify a single locus at which both independent mutation events and selection on an allele shared via gene flow, either slightly before or during selection, play a role in adaptation across the species range.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation deep sequencing of gene panels is being adopted as a diagnostic test to identify actionable mutations in cancer patient samples. However, clinical samples, such as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens, frequently provide low quantities of degraded, poor quality DNA. To overcome these issues, many sequencing assays rely on extensive PCR amplification leading to an accumulation of bias and artifacts. Thus, there is a need for a targeted sequencing assay that performs well with DNA of low quality and quantity without relying on extensive PCR amplification. We evaluate the performance of a targeted sequencing assay based on Oligonucleotide Selective Sequencing, which permits the enrichment of genes and regions of interest and the identification of sequence variants from low amounts of damaged DNA. This assay utilizes a repair process adapted to clinical FFPE samples, followed by adaptor ligation to single stranded DNA and a primer-based capture technique. Our approach generates sequence libraries of high fidelity with reduced reliance on extensive PCR amplification - this facilitates the accurate assessment of copy number alterations in addition to delivering accurate SNV and indel detection. We apply this method to capture and sequence the exons of a panel of 130 cancer-related genes, from which we obtain high read coverage uniformity across the targeted regions at starting input DNA amounts as low as 10 ng per sample. We further demonstrate the performance of this assay using a series of reference DNA samples, and by identifying sequence variants in DNA from matched clinical samples originating from different tissue types.",

The thermoregulatory effects of MDMA and TA may affect intravenous self-administration (IVSA) of MDMA but limited prior reports conflict.\\n\\nObjectiveTo determine how body temperature responses under high and low TA influence MDMA IVSA.\\n\\nMethodsMale Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to IVSA MDMA (1.0 mg/kg/infusion; 2-hr sessions; FR5 schedule of reinforcement) under TA 20{degrees}C or 30{degrees}C. Radiotelemetry transmitters recorded body temperature and activity during IVSA.\\n\\nResultsMDMA intake increased under both TA during acquisition, but to a greater extent in the 30{degrees}C group. The magnitude of hypothermia was initially equivalent between groups but diminished over training in the 30{degrees}C group. Within-session activity was initially lower in the 30{degrees} C group, but by the end of acquisition and maintenance, activity was similar for both groups. When TA conditions were swapped, the hot-trained group increased MDMA IVSA under 20 {degrees}C TA and a modest decrease in drug intake was observed in the cold-trained group under 30 {degrees}C TA. Subsequent non-contingent MDMA (1.0-5.0 mg/kg, i.v.) found that rats with higher MDMA IVSA rates showed blunted hypothermia compared with rats with lower IVSA levels; however, within-session activity did not differ by group. High TA increased intracranial self-stimulation thresholds in a different group of rats and MDMA reduced thresholds below baseline at low, but not high, TA.\\n\\nConclusionsHigh TA appears to enhance acquisition of MDMA IVSA through an aversive effect and not via thermoregulatory motivation.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia (Alphaproteobacteria, Rickettsiales) is the most common, and arguably one of the most important inherited symbionts. Molecular differentiation of Wolbachia strains is routinely performed with a set of five multilocus sequence typing (MLST) markers. However, since its inception in 2006, the performance of MLST in Wolbachia strain typing has not been assessed objectively. Here, we evaluate the properties of Wolbachia MLST markers and compare it to 252 other single copy loci present in the genome of most Wolbachia strains. Specifically, we investigated how well MLST performs at strain differentiation, at reflecting genetic diversity of strains, and as phylogenetic marker. We find that MLST loci are outperformed by other loci at all tasks they are currently employed for, and thus that they do not reflect the properties of a Wolbachia strain very well. We argue that whole genome typing approaches should be used for Wolbachia typing in the future. Alternatively, if few-loci-approaches are necessary, we provide a characterization of 252 single copy loci for a number a criteria, which may assist in designing specific typing systems or phylogenetic studies.",

    "abstract": "To study sensory representations, neuroscientists record neural activities while presenting different stimuli to the animal. From these data, we identify neurons whose activities depend systematically on each aspect of the stimulus. These neurons are said to be \\\"tuned\\\" to that stimulus feature. It is typically assumed that these tuned neurons represent the stimulus feature in their firing, whereas any \\\"untuned\\\" neurons do not contribute to its representation. Recent experimental work questioned this assumption, showing that in some circumstances, neurons that are untuned to a particular stimulus feature can contribute to its representation. These findings suggest that, by ignoring untuned neurons, our understanding of population coding might be incomplete. At the same time, several key questions remain unanswered: Are the impacts of untuned neurons on population coding due to weak tuning that is nevertheless below the threshold the experimenters set for calling neurons tuned (vs untuned)? Do these effects hold for different population sizes and/or correlation structures? And could neural circuit function ever benefit from having some untuned neurons vs having all neurons be tuned to the stimulus? Using theoretical calculations and analyses of in vivo neural data, I answer those questions by: a) showing how, in the presence of correlated variability, untuned neurons can enhance sensory information coding, for a variety of population sizes and correlation structures; b) demonstrating that this effect does not rely on weak tuning; and c) identifying conditions under which the neural code can be made more informative by replacing some of the tuned neurons with untuned ones. These conditions specify when there is a functional benefit to having untuned neurons.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn the visual system, most neurons firing rates are tuned to various aspects of the stimulus (motion, contrast, etc.). For each stimulus feature, however some neurons appear to be untuned: their firing rates do not depend on that stimulus feature. Previous work on information coding in neural populations ignored untuned neurons, assuming that only the neurons tuned to a given stimulus feature contribute to its encoding. Recent experimental work questioned this assumption, showing that neurons with no apparent tuning can sometimes contribute to information coding. However, key questions remain unanswered. First, how do the untuned neurons contribute to information coding, and could this effect rely on those neurons having weak tuning that was overlooked? Second, does the function of a neural circuit ever benefit from having some neurons untuned? Or should every neuron be tuned (even weakly) to every stimulus feature? Here, I use mathematical calculations and analyses of data from the mouse visual cortex to answer those questions. First, I show how (and why) correlations between neurons enable the untuned neurons to contribute to information coding. Second, I show that neural populations can often do a better job of encoding a given stimulus feature when some of the neurons are untuned for that stimulus feature. Thus, it may be best for the brain to segregate its tuning, leaving some neurons untuned for each stimulus feature. Along with helping to explain how the brain processes external stimuli, this work has strong implications for attempts to decode brain signals, to control brain-machine interfaces: better performance could be obtained if the activities of all neurons are decoded, as opposed to only those with strong tuning.",

    "abstract": "Brief epochs of beta oscillations have been implicated in sensorimotor control in the basal ganglia of task-performing healthy animals. However, which neural processes underlie their generation and how they are affected by sensorimotor processing remains unclear. To determine the mechanisms underlying transient beta oscillations in the local field potential (LFP), we combined computational modeling of the subthalamo-pallidal network for the generation of beta oscillations with realistic stimulation patterns derived from single unit data. The single unit data were recorded from different basal ganglia subregions in rats performing a cued choice task. In the recordings we found distinct firing patterns in the striatum, globus pallidus and subthalamic nucleus related to sensory and motor events during the behavioral task. Using these firing patterns to generate realistic inputs to our network model lead to transient beta oscillations with the same time course as the rat LFP data. In addition, our model can account for further non-intuitive aspects of beta modulation, including beta phase resets following sensory cues and correlations with reaction time. Overall, our model can explain how the combination of temporally regulated sensory responses of the subthalamic nucleus, ramping activity of the subthalamic nucleus, and movement-related activity of the globus pallidus, leads to transient beta oscillations during behavior.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTransient beta oscillations emerge in the normal functioning cortico-basal ganglia loop during behavior. In this work we employ a unique approach connecting a computational model closely with experimental data. In this way we achieve a simulation environment for our model that mimics natural input patterns in awake behaving animals. Using this approach we demonstrate that a computational model for beta oscillations in Parkinsons disease can also account for complex patterns of transient beta oscillations in healthy animals. Therefore, we propose that transient beta oscillations in healthy animals share the same mechanism with pathological beta oscillations in Parkinsons disease. This important result connects functional and pathological roles of beta oscillations in the basal ganglia.",

How membrane sealing of DNA and assembly of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are achieved and coordinated is poorly understood. Here, we reconstructed nuclear membrane topology and structure of assembling NPCs in a correlative three dimensional electron microscopy time-course of dividing human cells. Our quantitative ultrastructural analysis shows that nuclear membranes form from highly fenestrated ER sheets, whose shrinking holes are stabilized and then dilated into NPCs during inner ring complex assembly, forming thousands of transport channels within minutes. This mechanism is fundamentally different from interphase NPC assembly and explains how mitotic cells can rapidly establish a closed nuclear compartment while making it transport-competent at the same time.",

In this paper, we extend the methodology towards efficient sampling of related mutants by borrowing ideas from transfer learning methods in machine learning. Our method explicitly assumes that a similar set of slow modes and metastable states are found in both the wild type (base line) and its mutants. Under this assumption, we describe a few simple techniques using sequence mapping for transferring the slow modes and structural information contained in the wild type simulation to a mutant model for performing enhanced sampling. The resulting simulations can then be reweighted onto the full-phase space using Multi-state Bennett Acceptance Ratio, allowing for thermodynamic comparison against the wild type.

    "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) is one of three crops, along with rice and wheat, responsible for more than 1/2 of all calories consumed around the world. Increasing the yield and stress tolerance of these crops is essential to meet the growing need for food. The cost and speed of plant phenotyping is currently the largest constraint on plant breeding efforts. Datasets linking new types of high throughput phenotyping data collected from plants to the performance of the same genotypes under agronomic conditions across a wide range of environments are essential for developing new statistical approaches and computer vision based tools. A set of maize inbreds - primarily recently off patent lines - were phenotyped using a high throughput platform at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These lines have been previously subjected to high density genotyping, and scored for a core set of 13 phenotypes in field trials across 13 North American states in two years by the Genomes to Fields consortium. A total of 485 GB of image data including RGB, hyperspectral, fluorescence and thermal infrared photos has been released. Correlations between image-based measurements and manual measurements demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying variation in plant architecture using image data. However, naive approaches to measuring traits such as biomass can introduce nonrandom measurement errors confounded with genotype variation. Analysis of hyperspectral image data demonstrated unique signatures from stem tissue. Integrating heritable phenotypes from high-throughput phenotyping data with field data from different environments can reveal previously unknown factors influencing yield plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Coarse-grained molecular simulation models have provided immense, often general, insight into the complex behavior of condensed-phase systems, but suffer from a lost connection to the true dynamical properties of the underlying system. In general, the physics that is built into a model shapes the free-energy landscape, restricting the attainable static and kinetic properties. In this work, we perform a detailed investigation into the property interrelationships resulting from these restrictions, for a representative system of the helix-coil transition. Inspired by high-throughput studies, we systematically vary force-field parameters and monitor their structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic properties. The focus of our investigation is a simple coarse-grained model, which accurately represents the underlying structural ensemble, i.e., effectively avoids sterically-forbidden configurations. As a result of this built-in physics, we observe a rather large restriction in the topology of the networks characterizing the simulation kinetics. When screening across force-field parameters, we find that structurally-accurate models also best reproduce the kinetics, suggesting structural-kinetic relationships for these models. Additionally, an investigation into thermodynamic properties reveals a link between the cooperativity of the transition and the network topology at a single reference temperature.",

    "abstract": "A profile comparison method with position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is one of the most accurate alignment methods. Currently, cosine similarity and correlation coefficient are used as scoring functions of dynamic programming to calculate similarity between PSSMs. However, it is unclear that these functions are optimal for profile alignment methods. At least, by definition, these functions cannot capture non-linear relationships between profiles. Therefore, in this study, we attempted to discover a novel scoring function, which was more suitable for the profile comparison method than the existing ones. Firstly we implemented a new derivative free neural network by combining the conventional neural network with evolutionary strategy optimization method. Next, using the framework, the scoring function was optimized for aligning remote sequence pairs. Nepal, the pairwise profile aligner with the novel scoring function significantly improved both alignment sensitivity and precision, compared to aligners with the existing functions. Nepal improved alignment quality because of adaptation to remote sequence alignment and increasing the expressive power of similarity score. The novel scoring function can be realized using a simple matrix operation and easily incorporated into other aligners. With our scoring function, the performance of homology detection and/or multiple sequence alignment for remote homologous sequences would be further improved.",

    "abstract": "AbstractBrain-mapping of the congenitally blind human reveals extensive plasticity(1). The visual cortex of the blind has been observed to support higher cognitive functions including language and numerical processing(2, 3). This functional shift is hypothesized to reflect a metamodal cortical function, where computations are defined by the local network. In the case of developmental deafferentation, local circuits are considered to implement higher cognitive functions by accommodating diverse long-distance inputs(4-7). However, the extent to which visual deprivation triggers a reorganization of the large-scale network in the cortex is still controversial(8). Here we show that early prenatal ablation of the retina, an experimental model of anophthalmia in macaque, leads to a major reduction of area V1 and the creation of a default extrastriate cortex (DEC)(9, 10). Anophthalmic and normal macaques received retrograde tracer injections in DEC, as well as areas V2 and V4 post-natally. This revealed a six-fold expansion of the spatial extent of local connectivity in the DEC and a surprisingly high location of the DEC derived from a computational model of the cortical hierarchy(11). In the anophthalmic the set of areas projecting to the DEC, area V2 and V4 does not differ from that of normal adult controls, but there is a highly significant increase in the relative cumulative weight of the ventral stream areas input to the early visual areas. These findings show that although occupying the territory that would have become primary visual cortex the DEC exhibits features of a higher order area, thus reflecting a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on cortical specification. Understanding the interaction of these contributing factors will shed light on cortical plasticity during primate development and the neurobiology of blindness.",

    "abstract": "Prescribed burns are widely used for managing North American deciduous forests due to their ability to positively affect plant community structure and composition. This study examines the effects of neighboring herbaceous plants on the recruitment of Quercus alba (white oak) seedlings in fire-managed parts of Shawnee National Forest (Illinois, USA). Herbs were clipped to induce plant community stress and relative growth rates (RGRs) of planted white oak seedlings were assessed to determine if a competitive or facilitative dynamic is present. In addition to RGR, we observed the mycorrhizal network via fungal colonization in mesh bags to quantify belowground activity for our experimental plots. Our results supported fires positive effects on tree recruitment and herbaceous growth. Clipping combined with fire management decreased RGR. This finding suggests that a facilitative dynamic is at play and herbaceous neighbors help white oak seedlings persist due to protection from environmental stressors (p = 0.017). Soil moisture played a large role in promoting tree fitness on each of our sites. Lower hyphal biomass was observed in areas where herbs were clipped. We further speculate that the stress caused by clipping may have suspended or eliminated the need for mycorrhizae to form, possibly due to herb mortality. Knowing how herbs and trees interact will lead to purposeful forest community planning especially in fire-managed forests where herbs are likely to dominate post-prescribed burn.",

    "abstract": "The Ser/Thr protein kinase PINK1 phosphorylates the well-folded, globular protein ubiquitin (Ub) at a relatively protected site, Ser65. We had previously shown that Ser65-phosphorylation results in a conformational change, in which Ub adopts a dynamic equilibrium between the known, common Ub conformation and a distinct, second conformation in which the last {beta}-strand is retracted to extend the Ser65 loop and shorten the C-terminal tail. We here show using Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) NMR experiments, that a similar, C-terminally retracted (Ub-CR) conformation exists in wild-type Ub. Ub point mutations in the moving {beta}5-strand and in neighbouring strands shift the Ub/Ub-CR equilibrium. This enabled functional studies of the two states, and we show that the Ub-CR conformation binds to the PINK1 kinase domain through its extended Ser65 loop and is a superior PINK1 substrate. Together our data suggest that PINK1 utilises a lowly populated yet more suitable Ub-CR conformation of Ub for efficient phosphorylation. Our findings could be relevant for many kinases that phosphorylate residues in folded proteins or domains.",

    "abstract": "Alpha oscillations play a special role in vision. During sensory processing, reverse-correlation techniques revealed that white-noise luminance sequences elicit a robust occipital [~]10 Hz response that periodically reverberates the input sequence for up to 1 s. These perceptual echoes constitute the impulse response function of the visual system. However, the spatial dimension of perceptual echoes remains unknown: do they reverberate across the cortex simultaneously? Does stimulation over multiple visual coordinates evoke multiple synchronized echoes, or do they show consistent phase differences? Here, we tested the spatial dimension of perceptual echoes in two electroencephalogram (EEG) experiments manipulating the location of the visual stimulation. When a single disc flickered a white-noise luminance sequence in the upper visual field, we observed a single \\\"echo wave\\\" originating in posterior sensors and spatially propagating towards frontal ones (i.e. periodic travelling wave). The presentation of two independent flickering discs in separate visual hemifields produced two simultaneous and superimposed echo waves propagating in opposite directions, one in response to each stimulus. Strikingly, at many electrode sites, the phase of the two echoes differed, with a phase advance for the contralateral stimulus location. EEG source reconstruction tentatively located the waves within contralateral parieto-occipital cortex. In conclusion, the alpha rhythm processes stimulus information as a travelling wave that propagates across the cortical representation of retinotopic space in the human brain. In line with the \\\"cortical scanning\\\" hypothesis (Pitts & McCulloch, 1947), these results suggest the existence of an additional spatial dimension embedded in the phase of the alpha rhythm.\\n\\nSignificance statementHow does the spatial dimension of sensory processing relate to the temporal dimension of brain rhythms? Using correlation techniques, we characterized perceptual echoes, the average electroencephalogram response induced by visual stimuli that change luminance randomly. We found that perceptual echoes are actually periodic waves that travel through human visual cortex. Strikingly these periodic waves show consistent phase differences across the visual field, processing screen locations sequentially across distinct phases of the cycle following basic retinotopy. These results suggest the existence of an additional \\\"hidden\\\" spatial dimension in sensory cortex, encoded in the phase of the alpha oscillatory cycle. This could mean that perceptual echoes behave like sweeps of a sonar, processing the visual field in cycles of [~]100 ms duration.",

Two recently published articles in Nature (Lien et al.3) and Nature Genetics (Braasch et al.4) investigated the regulatory fate of gene duplicates after the salmonid-specific (Ss4R) and teleost specific (Ts3R) whole genome duplication (WGD) events, respectively. Both studies relied on tissue expression atlases for estimating regulatory divergence and used closely related unduplicated sister taxa (i.e. Northern pike and the spotted gar, respectively) as proxies for the ancestral expression state. Surprisingly, the two studies reach very different conclusions about the evolutionary mechanisms impacting gene expression after WGD. Braasch et al.4 concluded that the expression divergence was consistent with partitioning of tissue regulation between duplicates (subfunctionalization), while Lien et al.3 concluded that most divergence in tissue regulation were consistent with one copy maintaining ancestral tissue regulation while the other having diverged (in line with neofunctionalization). Here we show that this striking discrepancy in the conclusions of the two studies is a consequence of the data analysis approaches used, and is not related to underlying differences in the data.",

The low initial translocation occurred simultaneously in parallel with the increase in Ca2+. Initial translocation was inhibited in spite of Ca2+ increase when the diacylglycerol (DAG) binding domain of PKC was inhibited, suggesting that translocation requires intracellular Ca2+ increase and DAG. On the other hand, high secondary translocation was delayed, occurring after the Ca2+ wave; however, this secondary translocation occurred even when Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum was inhibited, while it did not occur when the mechanosensitive (MS) channel was inhibited. These results indicated that at least Ca2+ influx through MS channels is required.

We devised a comparative genomic strategy to track colonizing USA300 at different body sites after S. aureus infection.\\n\\nMETHODSWe sampled ST8 S. aureus from subjects at the site of a first known MRSA infection. Within 60 days of this infection and again 12 months later, each subject was tested for asymptomatic colonization in the nose, throat and perirectal region. 93 S. aureus strains underwent whole genome shotgun sequencing.\\n\\nRESULTSGenome sequencing revealed that 23 patients carried USA300 intra-subject lineages (ISLs), defined as having an index infection isolate (III) and closely related strains. Pairwise distance between strains in different ISLs was 48 to 162 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), whereas within the same ISL it was 0 to 26 SNPs. At the initial sampling time among 23 subjects, we isolated S. aureus from the nose, throat and perirectal sites from 15, 11 and 15 of them, respectively. Twelve months later we isolated S. aureus within the same ISL from 9 subjects, with 6, 3 and 3 strains from the nose, throat and perirectal area, respectively. The median time from initial acquisition of the S. aureus USA300 strains to culture of the index infection was estimated at 18 weeks. Strains in ISLs from the same subject differed in plasmid and prophage content, and contained deletions that removed the mecA-containing SCCmec and ACME regions. Five strains contained frameshift mutations in agr toxin-regulating genes. Persistence of an ISL was not associated with clinical or demographic subject characteristics.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONClonal lineages of USA300 may continue to colonize people at one or more anatomic sites up to a year after an initial infection and experience loss of the SCCmec, loss and gain of other mobile genetic elements, and mutations in the agr operon.",

    "abstract": "Type IV pili are expressed by a wide range of prokaryotes, including the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These flexible fibres mediate twitching motility, biofilm maturation, surface adhesion, and virulence. The pilus is composed mainly of major pilin subunits while the low abundance minor pilins FimU-PilVWXE and the putative adhesin PilY1 prime pilus assembly and are proposed to form the pilus tip. The minor pilins and PilY1 are encoded in an operon that is positively regulated by the FimS-AlgR two-component system. Independent of pilus assembly, PilY1 is proposed to be a mechanosensory component that - in conjunction with minor pilins - triggers up-regulation of acute virulence phenotypes upon surface attachment. Here, we investigated the link between the minor pilins and virulence. pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants had reduced virulence towards Caenorhabditis elegans relative to wild type or a major pilin mutant, implying a role in pathogenicity that is independent of pilus assembly. We hypothesized that loss of specific minor pilins relieves feedback inhibition on FimS-AlgR, increasing transcription of the minor pilin operon and other members of the AlgR regulon. Reporter assays confirmed that FimS-AlgR were required for the increased expression from the minor pilin operon promoter upon loss of select minor pilins. Overexpression of AlgR or its hyperactivation via point mutation reduced virulence, and the virulence defects of pilW, pilX, and pilY1 mutants were dependent on FimS-AlgR expression and activation. We propose that PilY1 and the minor pilins inhibit their own expression, and that loss of these proteins leads to FimS-mediated activation of AlgR and reduced expression of acute-phase virulence factors. This mechanism could contribute to adaptation of P. aeruginosa in chronic lung infections, as mutations in the minor pilin operon result in the loss of piliation and increased expression of AlgR-dependent virulence factors - such as alginate - that are characteristic of such infections.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPseudomonas aeruginosa causes dangerous infections, including chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. It uses many strategies to infect its hosts, including deployment of grappling hook-like fibres called type IV pili. Among the components involved in assembly and function of the pilus are five proteins called minor pilins that - along with a larger protein called PilY1 - may help the pilus attach to surfaces. In a roundworm infection model, loss of PilY1 and specific minor pilins delayed killing, while loss of other pilus proteins did not. We traced this effect to increased activation of the FimS-AlgR regulatory system that inhibits expression of virulence factors used to initiate infections, while positively regulating chronic infection traits such as alginate production, a phenotype called mucoidy. A disruption in the appropriate timing of FimS-AlgR-dependent virulence factor expression when select minor pilins or PilY1 are missing may explain why those pilus-deficient mutants have reduced virulence compared with others whose products are not under FimS-AlgR control. Increased FimS-AlgR activity upon loss of PilY1 and specific minor pilins could help to explain the frequent co-occurrence of the non-piliated and mucoid phenotypes that are hallmarks of chronic P. aeruginosa lung infections.",

    "abstract": "Brain stimulation can be used to engage and modulate rhythmic activity in cortical networks. However, the outcomes have been shown to be impacted by behavioral states and endogenous brain fluctuations. To better understand how this intrinsic oscillatory activity controls the brains susceptibility to stimulation, we analyzed a computational model of the thalamocortical system in both the rest and task states, to identify the mechanisms by which endogenous alpha oscillations (8Hz-12Hz) are impacted by periodic stimulation. Our analysis shows that the differences between different brain states can be explained by a passage through a bifurcation combined to stochastic resonance - a mechanism whereby irregular fluctuations amplify the response of a nonlinear system to weak signals. Indeed, our findings suggest that modulating brain oscillations is best achieved in states of low endogenous rhythmic activity, and that irregular state-dependent fluctuations in thalamic inputs shape the susceptibility of cortical population to periodic stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Polar body (PB) formation is an extreme form of unequal cell division that occurs in oocytes due to the eccentric position of the small meiotic spindle near the oocyte cortex. Prior to PB formation, a chromatin-centered process causes the cortex overlying the meiotic chromosomes to become polarized. This polarized cortical subdomain marks the site where a cortical protrusion or outpocket forms at the oocyte surface creating the future PBs. We observed that PB1 becomes tethered to the egg via PB2, indicating that the site of PB1 cytokinesis directed the precise site for PB2 emission. We therefore studied whether the midbody remnant left behind following PB1 emission was involved, together with the egg chromatin, in defining the precise cortical site for PB2 emission. During outpocketing of PB2 in ascidians, we discovered that a small corps around 1m in diameter protruded from the center of the cortical outpocket that will form the future PB2, which we call the \\\"polar corps\\\". During emission of PB2, this small polar corps became localized between PB2 and PB1 and appeared to link PB2 to PB1. We tested the hypothesis that this small polar corps on the surface of the forming PB2 was the midbody remnant from the previous round of PB1 cytokinesis. We had previously discovered that Plk1::Ven labeled midbody remnants in ascidian embryos. We therefore used Plk1::Ven to follow the dynamics of the PB1 midbody remnant during meiosis II. Plk1::Ven strongly labeled the small polar corps that formed on the surface of the cortical outpocket that created PB2. Following emission of PB2, this polar corps was rich in Plk1::Ven and linked PB2 to PB1. By labelling actin (with LifeAct::mCherry/GFP or TRITC-Phalloidin) we also demonstrated that actin accumulates at the midbody remnant and also forms a cortical cap around the midbody remnant in meiosis II that prefigured the precise site of cortical outpocketing during PB2 emission. Phalloidin staining of actin and immunolabelling of anti-phospho aPKC during meiosis II in eggs that had PB1 removed showed that the midbody remnant remained within the egg following emission of PB1. Dynamic imaging of microtubules labelled with Ens::3GFP, MAP7::GFP or EB3::3GFP showed that one pole of the second meiotic spindle was located near the midbody remnant while the other pole rotated away from the cortex during outpocketing. Finally, we report that failure of the second meiotic spindle to rotate can lead to the formation of two cortical outpockets at anaphase II, one above each set of chromatids. It is not known whether the midbody remnant of PB1 is involved in directing the precise location of PB2 in other species as in ascidians. However, a review of the literature indicates that PB1 is tethered to the egg surface via PB2 in a number of species including members of the cnidarians, lophotrochozoa and echinoids, suggesting that the midbody remnant formed during PB1 emission may be involved in directing the precise site of PB2 emission throughout the invertebrates.",

However, live cell imaging has numerous challenging issues about accurate edge localization. Here, we develop a deep learning-based pipeline, termed MARS-Net (Multiple-microscopy- type-based Accurate and Robust Segmentation Network), that utilizes transfer learning and the datasets from multiple types of microscopy to localize cell edges with high accuracy, allowing quantitative profiling of cellular morphodynamics. For effective training with the datasets from multiple types of live cell microscopy, we integrated the pretrained VGG-19 encoder with U-Net decoder and added dropout layers. Using this structure, we were able to train one neural network model that can accurately segment various live cell movies from phase contrast, spinning disk confocal, and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopes. Intriguingly, MARS-Net produced more accurate edge localization than the neural network models trained with single microscopy type datasets, whereas the standard U-Net could not increase the overall accuracy. We expect that MARS-Net can accelerate the studies of cellular morphodynamics by providing accurate segmentation of challenging live cell images.",

As the popularity of the de Bruijn graph as an index has increased over the past few years, so have the number of proposed representations of this structure. Existing structures typically fall into two categories; those that are hashing-based and provide very fast access to the underlying k-mer information, and those that are space-frugal and provide asymptotically efficient but practically slower pattern search.\\n\\nOur representation achieves a compromise between these two extremes. By building upon minimum perfect hashing, carefully organizing our data structure, and making use of succinct representations where applicable, our data structure provides practically fast k-mer lookup while greatly reducing the space compared to traditional hashing-based implementations. Further, we describe a sampling scheme built on the same underlying representation, which provides the ability to trade off k-mer query speed for a reduction in the de Bruijn graph index size. We believe this representation strikes a desirable balance between speed and space usage, and it will allow for fast search on large reference sequences.\\n\\nPufferfish is developed in C++11, is open source (GPL v3), and is available at https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/Pufferfish.

In this approach, firstly 150 predicted protein structures were obtained from CASP12 Stage 2 tarball and ranked using clustering-based quality assessment software. Secondly, residue-residue contacts were assigned in top 10 protein structures based on distance between residues. Finally, residue-residue contacts were predicted in target protein based on consensus/average in top 10 predicted structures. This simple approach performs better than most of CASP12 methods in the categories of TBM and TBM/FM. It ranked 1st in following categories; i) TBM domain on list size L/5, ii) TBM/FM domain on list size L/5 and iii) TBM/FM domain on Top 10.

Notably, overexpression of the wild type PRKACA was unable to fully recapitulate the oncogenic activity of DNAJB1-PRKACA, implying that FL-HCC does not simply result from enhanced PRKACA expression. Tumorigenesis was significantly enhanced by genetic activation of {beta}-catenin, an observation supported by evidence of recurrent Wnt pathway mutations in human FL-HCC, as well as treatment with hepatotoxin 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC), which causes tissue injury, inflammation and fibrosis. Our study validates the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion kinase as an oncogenic driver and candidate drug target for FL-HCC and establishes a practical model for preclinical studies to identify strategies to treat this disease.\\n\\nSignificanceEfforts to understand and treat FL-HCC have been confounded by a lack of models that accurately reflect the genetics and biology of the disease. Here, we demonstrate that the Dnajb1-Prkaca gene fusion drives tumorigenesis in mice, and that fusion to DNAJB1 drives FL-HCC initiation more effectively than wild type PRKACA overexpression. The requirement of the PRKACA kinase domain in tumor initiation establishes the potential utility of kinase inhibitors targeting the fusion. By identifying genetic and environmental factors that can enhance the consistency and aggressiveness of disease progression, we reveal biological characteristics of the disease and advance a robust platform for future pre-clinical studies.",

However, unlike mutations in the posteriorly localized PAR-2 protein, par-1 mutations do not cause failure to restrict the anterior PAR polarity complex. Further, it has been difficult to examine the role of PAR-1 in subsequent divisions due to the early defects in par-1 mutant embryos. Here we show that the PIG-1 kinase acts redundantly with PAR-1 to restrict the anterior PAR-3 protein for polarity maintenance in the one-cell embryo. By using a weak allele of par-1 that exhibits enhanced lethality when combined with a pig-1 mutation we have further explored roles for these genes in subsequent divisions. We find that both PIG-1 and PAR-1 regulate spindle orientation in the EMS blastomere of the four-cell stage embryo to ensure that it undergoes an asymmetric division. In this cell, PIG-1 and PAR-1 act in parallel pathways for spindle positioning, PIG-1 in the MES-1/SRC-1 pathway and PAR-1 in the Wnt pathway.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which prehistoric migrations of farmers influenced the genetic pool of western North Africans remains unclear. Archaeological evidence suggests the Neolithization process may have happened through the adoption of innovations by local Epipaleolithic communities, or by demic diffusion from the Eastern Mediterranean shores or Iberia. Here, we present the first analysis of individuals genome sequences from early and late Neolithic sites in Morocco, as well as Early Neolithic individuals from southern Iberia. We show that Early Neolithic Moroccans are distinct from any other reported ancient individuals and possess an endemic element retained in present-day Maghrebi populations, confirming a long-term genetic continuity in the region. Among ancient populations, Early Neolithic Moroccans are distantly related to Levantine Natufian hunter-gatherers ([~]9,000 BCE) and Pre-Pottery Neolithic farmers ([~]6,500 BCE). Although an expansion in Early Neolithic times is also plausible, the high divergence observed in Early Neolithic Moroccans suggests a long-term isolation and an early arrival in North Africa for this population. This scenario is consistent with early Neolithic traditions in North Africa deriving from Epipaleolithic communities who adopted certain innovations from neighbouring populations. Late Neolithic ([~]3,000 BCE) Moroccans, in contrast, share an Iberian component, supporting theories of trans-Gibraltar gene flow. Finally, the southern Iberian Early Neolithic samples share the same genetic composition as the Cardial Mediterranean Neolithic culture that reached Iberia [~]5,500 BCE. The cultural and genetic similarities of the Iberian Neolithic cultures with that of North African Neolithic sites further reinforce the model of an Iberian migration into the Maghreb.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe acquisition of agricultural techniques during the so-called Neolithic revolution has been one of the major steps forward in human history. Using next-generation sequencing and ancient DNA techniques, we directly test if Neolithization in North Africa occurred through the transmission of ideas or by demic diffusion. We show that Early Neolithic Moroccans are composed of an endemic Maghrebi element still retained in present-day North African populations and distantly related to Epipaleolithic communities from the Levant. However, late Neolithic individuals from North Africa are admixed, with a North African and a European component. Our results support the idea that the Neolithization of North Africa might have involved both the development of Epipaleolithic communities and the migration of people from Europe.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplications and gene losses are major determinants of genome evolution and phenotypic diversity. The frequency of gene turnover (gene gains and gene losses combined) is known to vary between organisms. Comparative genomic analyses of gene families can highlight such variation; however, estimates of gene turnover rates may be biased when using highly fragmented genome assemblies resulting in poor gene annotations. Here, we address potential biases introduced by gene annotation errors in estimates of gene turnover frequencies in a dataset including both well-annotated angiosperm genomes and the incomplete gene sets of four Pinaceae including two pine species, Norway spruce and Douglas-fir. Previous studies have shown low overall substitution rates, but higher levels of adaptive substitutions, in genes from Pinaceae and other gymnosperms compared to angiosperms. Conversely, our analysis suggests that pines experienced higher gene turnover rates than angiosperm lineages lacking recent whole-genome duplications. This finding is robust to both known major issues in Pinaceae gene sets: missing gene models and erroneous annotation of pseudogenes. A separate analysis limited to the four Pinaceae gene sets confirmed an accelerated gene turnover rate in pines compared to Norway spruce and Douglas-fir. Our results indicate that gene turnover significantly contributes to genome variation and possibly to adaptation and speciation in Pinaceae. Moreover, these findings indicate that reliable estimates of gene turnover frequencies can be discerned in incomplete and potentially inaccurate gene sets.",

Therefore, a multipathogen modified Vaccinia Ankara vector, expressing antigens from the above pathogens, was constructed. Two recombinants, one carrying the EV71 and JEV pathogen sequence and one the RABV-HBV pathogen sequence were generated. To ensure similar expression of the antigens, a T7-promoter was linked to the expression cassettes of all pathogen sequences. Direct regulation of this promoter was achieved through co-infection with a second T7-polymerase expressing MVA. Protein expression using this co-infection model of expression was demonstrated in vitro. To investigate the co-infection model of antigen delivery in vivo, a murine immunogenicity study was performed using the MVA-RABV-HBV recombinant.

There is recent interest in understanding how CFZ works following the demonstration of its unique ability to shorten the treatment of MDR-TB. However, the target of CFZ in mycobacteria has remained elusive. Here, we show that CFZ binds to mycobacterial integration host factor (mIHF), which is an essential nucleoid associated protein in mycobacteria involved in DNA protection, chromosome organization and global gene regulation. We demonstrate that CFZ inhibits mIHF binding to DNA and interferes with mycobacterial gene expression. This mode of action is unique among all antibiotics including antimycibacterial agents and may help to explain its unusual action against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our study provides new insight about the mechanism of action of this intriguing drug and has implications for developing more effective treatment of TB.",

Using EEG, we investigated how previous interactions with, and evaluations of, an avatar in virtual reality subsequently influenced attentional allocation to the face of that avatar. We focused on changes in the alpha activity as an index of attentional allocation. We found that the onset of an avatars face whom the participant had developed a rapport with induced greater alpha suppression. This suggests greater attentional resources allocated to the interacted-with avatars. The evaluative ratings of the avatar induced a U-shaped change in alpha suppression, such that participants paid most attention when the avatar was rated as average. These results suggest that attentional allocation is thus an important element of how behaviour is altered in the presence of a secondary individual.",

Whereas the role of PAG in expression of defensive behavior is well understood, the relationship between activity of PAG neurons and fear learning, the exact timing of PAG contributions to learning during the conditioning trial, and the contributions of different PAG columns to fear learning are poorly understood. We assessed the effects of optogenetic inhibition of lateral (LPAG) and ventrolateral (VLPAG) PAG neurons on fear learning. Using adenoassociated viral vectors expressing halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0), we show that brief optogenetic inhibition of LPAG or VLPAG during delivery of the shock unconditioned stimulus (US) augments acquisition of contextual or cued fear conditioning and we also show that this inhibition augments post-encounter defensive responses to a non-noxious threat. Taken together, these results show that LPAG and VLPAG serve a key role in regulation of Pavlovian fear learning at the time of US delivery. These findings provide strong support for existing models which state that LPAG and VLPAG contribute to a fear prediction error signal determining variations in the effectiveness of the aversive US in supporting learning.",

    "abstract": "NMDAR antagonism alters mesolimbic, hippocampal, and cortical function, acutely reproducing the positive, cognitive, and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. These physiological and behavioral effects may depend differentially on NMDAR subtype-and region-specific effects. The dramatic electrophysiological signatures of NMDAR blockade in rodents include potentiated high frequency oscillations (HFOs, ~140 Hz), likely generated in mesolimbic structures, and increased HFO phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a phenomenon related to goal-directed behavior and dopaminergic tone. This study examined the impact of subtype-specific NMDAR antagonism on HFOs and PAC. We found that positive-symptom-associated NR2A-preferring antagonism (NVP-AAM077), but not NR2B-specific antagonism (Ro25-6985) or saline control, replicated increases in HFO power seen with nonspecific antagonism (MK-801).

    "abstract": "A personalized approach based on a patients or pathogens unique genomic sequence is the foundation of precision medicine. Genomic findings must be robust and reproducible, and experimental data capture should adhere to FAIR guiding principles. Moreover, effective precision medicine requires standardized reporting that extends beyond wet lab procedures to computational methods. The BioCompute framework (https://osf.io/zm97b/) enables standardized reporting of genomic sequence data provenance, including provenance domain, usability domain, execution domain, verification kit, and error domain. This framework facilitates communication and promotes interoperability. Bioinformatics computation instances that employ the BioCompute framework are easily relayed, repeated if needed and compared by scientists, regulators, test developers, and clinicians. Easing the burden of performing the aforementioned tasks greatly extends the range of practical application. Large clinical trials, precision medicine, and regulatory submissions require a set of agreed upon standards that ensures efficient communication and documentation of genomic analyses. The BioCompute paradigm and the resulting BioCompute Objects (BCO) offer that standard, and are freely accessible as a GitHub organization (https://github.com/biocompute-objects) following the \\\"Open-Stand.org principles for collaborative open standards development\\\". By communication of high-throughput sequencing studies using a BCO, regulatory agencies (e.g., FDA), diagnostic test developers, researchers, and clinicians can expand collaboration to drive innovation in precision medicine, potentially decreasing the time and cost associated with next generation sequencing workflow exchange, reporting, and regulatory reviews.",

    "abstract": "Although cells respond specifically to environments, how environmental identity is encoded intracellularly is not understood. Here we study this organization of information in budding yeast by estimating the mutual information between environmental transitions and the dynamics of nuclear translocation for ten transcription factors. Our method of estimation is general, scalable, and based on decoding from single cells. The dynamics of the transcription factors are necessary to encode the highest amounts of extracellular information, and we show that information is transduced through two channels: generalists (Msn2/4, Tod6/Dot6, Maf1, and Sfp1) can encode the nature of multiple stresses but only if stress is high; specialists (Hog1, Yap1, and Mig1/2) encode one particular stress, but do so more quickly and for a wider range of magnitudes. Each transcription factor reports differently, and it is only their collective response that distinguishes between multiple environmental states. Changes in the dynamics of the localization of transcription factors thus constitute a precise, distributed internal representation of extracellular change, and we predict that such multi-dimensional representations are common in cellular decision-making.\\n\\nSignificance StatementTo thrive in diverse environments, cells must represent extracellular change intracellularly despite stochastic biochemistry. Here we introduce a quantitative framework for investigating the organization of information within a cell. Combining single-cell measurements of intracellular dynamics with a new, scalable methodology for estimating mutual information between time-series and a discrete input, we demonstrate that extracellular information is encoded in the dynamics of the nuclear localization of transcription factors and that information is lost with alternative static statistics. Any one transcription factor is usually insufficient, but the collective dynamics of multiple transcription factors can represent complex extracellular change. We therefore show that a cells internal representation of its environment can be both distributed across diverse proteins and dynamically encoded.",

Based on our data, we estimate that 34% of de novo damaging variants seen in OCD contribute to risk, and that de novo damaging variants in approximately 335 genes contribute to risk in 22% of OCD cases. Furthermore, genes harboring de novo damaging variants in OCD are enriched for those reported in neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism spectrum disorders.

Self-report measures of prenatal and postnatal depression and maternal report of child anxious depressed symptoms at 2.5, 3.5 and 5.0 years were obtained from an  extensive sample of first time mothers recruited from the general population (N = 794). Salivary NR3C1 1-F promoter methylation was assayed at 14 months in an  intensive subsample (N = 176) stratified during pregnancy by psychosocial risk. Generalised structural equation models (SEM) were fitted and estimated by maximum likelihood to allow inclusion of participants from both intensive and extensive samples.\\n\\nResultsPostnatal depression was associated with NR3C1 methylation and with anxious-depressed symptoms in the daughters of mothers lacking the hypothesised protective effect of high prenatal depression (prenatal-postnatal depression interaction for methylation, p =.00001; for child symptoms, p = .011). In girls, NR3C1 methylation mediated the association between maternal depression and child anxious-depressed symptoms. The effects were greater in girls than boys, and the test of the sex differences in the effect of the prenatal-postnatal depression interaction on both outcomes gave {chi}2(2) = 5.95 (p=.051).\\n\\nConclusionsThis is the first study to show in humans that, as a result of sex-biased reproductive investment and fetal adaptation, epigenetic and early behavioural outcomes may arise through different mechanisms in males and females.

    "abstract": "Rather than being a homogenous diffusion-dominated structure, biological membranes can exhibit areas with distinct composition and characteristics commonly termed as lipid domains. Arguably the most comprehensively studied examples in bacteria are domains formed by cardiolipin, which have been functionally linked to protein targeting, cell division process, and mode of action of membrane targeting antimicrobials. Cardiolipin domains were originally identified in the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli based on preferential staining by the fluorescent membrane dye nonyl acridine orange (NAO), and later reported to exist also in other Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. Recently, the lipid-specificity of NAO has been questioned based on studies conducted in E. coli. This prompted us to re-analyse cardiolipin domains also in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis. Here we show that logarithmically growing B. subtilis does not form microscopically detectable cardiolipin-specific lipid domains, and that NAO is not a specific stain for cardiolipin in this organism.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of human listeriosis. While the ability of L. monocytogenes to enter and survive in professional phagocytes is critical to establish a successful infection, mechanisms of invasion are poorly understood. Our previous investigation into the role of type I interferon-stimulated genes in bacterial infection revealed that the human immunoglobulin receptor Fc{gamma}RIa served as a L. monocytogenes invasion factor. Fc{gamma}RIa-mediated L. monocytogenes entry occurred independently of immunoglobulin interaction or bacterial internalins. However, the bacterial determinants that mediate Fc{gamma}RIa interaction remain unclear. Using a comparative genomics approach, we identify actin assembly-inducing protein ActA as a pathogen specific ligand of Fc{gamma}RIa. Fc{gamma}RIa enhanced entry of pathogenic L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii strain but not non-pathogenic L. innocua. We found that the major virulence regulator PrfA is required for pathogen entry into Fc{gamma}RIa-expressing cells and identify its gene target actA as the critical Listeria ligand. ActA alone was sufficient to promote entry into Fc{gamma}RIa-expressing cells, and this function is independent of its actin nucleating activity. Together, these studies present an unexpected role of ActA beyond its canonical function in actin-based motility and expand our understanding of Listeria strategies for host cell invasion.\\n\\nImportanceListeria monocytogenes is a food-borne bacterial pathogen and a causative agent of listeriosis with up to 50% mortality rate in immunocompromised individuals. While the mechanisms of Listeria entry into non-phagocytic cells have been extensively characterized, the details of phagocytic cell invasion are still poorly understood. We have recently discovered that human immunoglobulin receptor Fc{gamma}RIa mediates Listeria uptake by monocytic cells. This process occurred independently of canonical immunoglobulin interactions as well as classic Listeria internalization factors. Importantly, molecular determinants of Listeria-Fc{gamma}RIa interaction leading to bacterial entry, remained unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that Listeria virulence factor actin-assembly inducing protein ActA is required for Fc{gamma}RIa-mediated entry. Further, ActA was found to be sufficient for the internalization, suggesting its role as a bacterial ligand of Fc{gamma}RIa. Together, these findings expand our knowledge of mechanisms that Listeria has evolved to exploit cellular signaling pathways and immune defense of the host.",

    "abstract": "Animals integrate external cues with information about internal conditions such as metabolic state to execute the appropriate behavioral and developmental decisions. Information about food quality and quantity is assessed by the intestine and transmitted to modulate neuronal functions via mechanisms that are not fully understood. The conserved Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) controls multiple processes in response to cellular stressors and growth factors. Here we show that TORC2 coordinates larval development and adult behaviors in response to environmental cues and feeding state in the bacterivorous nematode C. elegans. During development, pheromone, bacterial food, and temperature regulate expression of the daf-7 TGF-{beta} and daf-28 insulin-like peptide in sensory neurons to promote a binary decision between reproductive growth and entry into the alternate dauer larval stage. We find that TORC2 acts in the intestine to regulate neuronal expression of both daf-7 and daf-28, which together reflect bacterial-diet dependent feeding status, thus providing a mechanism for integration of food signals with external cues in the regulation of neuroendocrine gene expression. In the adult, TORC2 similarly acts in the intestine to modulate food-regulated foraging behaviors via the PDFR-1 neuropeptide receptor. We also demonstrate that genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes, and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with these traits.Together, these results suggest that TORC2 acts as a hub for communication of feeding state information from the gut to the brain, thereby contributing to modulation of neuronal function by internal state.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDecision-making in all animals, including humans, involves weighing available information about the external environment as well as the animals internal conditions. Information about the environment is obtained via the sensory nervous system, whereas internal state can be assessed via cues such as levels of hormones or nutrients. How multiple external and internal inputs are processed in the nervous system to drive behavior or development is not fully understood. In this study, we examine how the nematode C. elegans integrates dietary information received by the gut with environmental signals to alter nervous system function. We have found that a signaling complex, called TORC2, acts in the gut to relay nutrition signals to alter hormonal signaling by the nervous system in C. elegans. Altered neuronal signaling in turn affects a food-dependent binary developmental decision in larvae, as well as food-dependent foraging behaviors in adults. Our results provide a mechanism by which animals prioritize specific signals such as feeding status to appropriately alter their development and/or behavior.",

    "abstract": "One remarkable capacity when we grasp and manipulate tools relies on the ability to predict the grip force required to handle them in relation to their mechanical properties and the surrounding environment. However, rapid changes in the dynamical context may constitute a substantial challenge. Here, we test how participants can switch between different and never experienced dynamical environments induced by centrifugation of the body. Seven subjects lifted an object four times in a row successively in 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 2, 1.5 and 1g. We continuously measured grip force, load force and the gravitoinertial acceleration that was aligned with body axis (perceived gravity). Participants adopted stereotyped grasping movements immediately upon entry in a new environment and needed only one trial to adapt grip forces to a stable performance in each new gravity environment. While participants predictively applied larger grip forces when they expected increasing gravity steps, they did not decrease grip force proportionally when they expected decreasing gravity steps, indicating imperfect anticipation in that condition. The subjects performance could rather be explained by a combination of successful scaling of grip force according to gravity changes and a separate safety factor. The data suggest that in highly unfamiliar dynamic environments, grip force regulation is characterized by a combination of a successful anticipation of the experienced environmental condition, a safety factor reflecting strategic response to uncertainties about the environment and rapid feedback mechanisms to optimize performance under constant conditions.",

We present quality-controlled and detailed method that is simpler and faster than previous approches, and uses FLIMfit open-source software. We demonstrate the versatility of our method through its combination with immunofluorescence and its implementation in immortalised cells and primary neurons. Owing to these developments, we applied this method to elucidate the function of the DNA damage response kinase, ATM, in regulating chromatin organisation after genotoxic-stress. We unravelled a role for ATM in regulating chromatin compaction independently of DNA damage.

With the advances of single cell imaging and single cell biology it becomes crucial to understand intracel-lular processes in time and space. Activation of cell surface receptors often triggers a signaling cascade including the activation of membrane-attached and cytosolic signaling components, which eventually transmit the signal to the cell nucleus. Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly. We present a mathematical analysis of signal transduction in time and space by providing analytical solutions for different spatial arrangements of linear signaling cascades. These investigations are complemented by numerical simulations of non-linear cascades and asymmetric cell shapes.",

Here, we identify genomic and transcriptomic traits associated to the immune-phenotype of 9,403 tumors of 29 solid cancers. In highly cytotoxic immune-phenotypes we found tumors with low clonal heterogeneity enriched by alterations of genes involved in epigenetic regulation, ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, antigen-presentation and cell-cell communication, which may drive resistance. Tumors with immune-phenotypes with mid cytotoxicity present an over-activation of processes involved in invasion and remodeling of neighboring tissues that may foster the recruitment of immune-suppressive cells. Tumors with poor cytotoxic immune-phenotype tend to be of more advanced stages and present frequent alterations in cell cycle, hedgehog, beta-catenin and TGF-beta pathways, which may drive the immune depletion.

    "abstract": "O_LISpecies traits mediate ecological interaction outcomes and community structure. It is important, therefore, to identify the minimum number of traits required to characterise observed networks, i.e. the  minimum dimensionality. Existing methods for estimating minimum dimensionality often lack three features commonly associated with a higher numbers of traits: a mechanistic description of observed interactions, alternative interaction modes (e.g. different feeding strategies such as active vs sit-and-wait feeding), and trait-mediated  forbidden links. Omitting these features can lead to underestimation of the trait numbers involved, and therefore, minimum dimensionality. Here, we develop a  minimum mechanistic dimensionality measure, accounting for these three features.\nC_LIO_LIThe only input required by our method is the observed network of interaction outcomes. We then assume how traits are mechanistically involved in alternative interaction modes. These unidentified traits are contrasted using pairwise performance inequalities between the interacting species. E.g. if a predator feeds upon a prey species via a typical predation mode, in each step of the predation sequence the predators performance must be greater than the preys. We construct a system of inequalities from all observed outcomes, which we attempt to solve with mixed integer linear programming. The minimum number of traits required for a feasible system of inequalities provides our dimensionality estimate.\nC_LIO_LIWe applied our method to 658 published empirical ecological networks including animal dominance, predator-prey, primary consumption, pollination, parasitism and seed dispersal networks, to compare with minimum dimensionality estimates when the three focal features are missing. Minimum dimensionality was typically higher when including alternative interaction modes (54% of empirical networks),  forbidden interactions as trait-mediated interaction outcomes (92%), or a mechanistic perspective (81%), compared to network dimensionality estimates missing these features.\nC_LIO_LIOur method can reduce the risk of omitting essential traits that are involved mechanistically, in different interaction modes, or in failure outcomes. More accurate estimates will allow us to parameterise models to generate theoretical networks with a more realistic structure at the interaction outcome level. Thus, we hope our method can improve predictions of community structure and structure-dependent dynamics.\nC_LI",
