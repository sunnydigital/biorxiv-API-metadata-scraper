    "abstract": "We introduce ABLE (Approximate Blockwise Likelihood Estimation), a novel composite likelihood framework based on a recently introduced summary of sequence variation: the blockwise site frequency spectrum (bSFS). This simulation-based framework uses the the frequencies of bSFS configurations to jointly model demographic history and recombination and is explicitly designed to make inference using multiple whole genomes or genome-wide multi-locus data (e.g. RADSeq) catering to the needs of researchers studying model or non-model organisms respectively. The flexible nature of our method further allows for arbitrarily complex population histories using unphased and unpolarized whole genome sequences. In silico experiments demonstrate accurate parameter estimates across a range of divergence models with increasing complexity, and as a proof of principle, we infer the demographic history of the two species of orangutan from multiple genome sequences (over 160 Mbp in length) from each species. Our results indicate that the two orangutan species split approximately 650-950 thousand years ago but experienced a pulse of secondary contact much more recently, most likely during a period of low sea-level South East Asia ([~]300,000 years ago). Unlike previous analyses we can reject a history of continuous gene flow and co-estimate genome-wide recombination. ABLE is available for download at https://github.com/champost/ABLE.",

    "abstract": "Many bacteria are adapted for attaching to surfaces and for building complex communities, termed biofilms. The biofilm mode of life is predominant in bacterial ecology. So, too, is exposure of bacteria to ubiquitous viral pathogens, termed bacteriophages. Although biofilmphage encounters are likely to be very common in nature, little is known about how phages might interact with biofilm-dwelling bacteria. It is also unclear how the ecological dynamics of phages and their hosts depend on the biological and physical properties of the biofilm environment. To make headway in this area, here we develop the first biofilm simulation framework that captures key mechanistic features of biofilm growth and phage infection. Using these simulations, we find that the equilibrium state of interaction between biofilms and phages is governed largely by nutrient availability to biofilms, infection likelihood per host encounter, and the ability of phages to diffuse through biofilm populations. Interactions between the biofilm matrix and phage particles are thus likely to be of fundamental importance, controlling the extent to which bacteria and phages can coexist in natural contexts. Our results open avenues to new questions of host-parasite coevolution and horizontal gene transfer in spatially structured biofilm contexts.",

    "abstract": "The readiness potential (RP)--a key ERP correlate of upcoming action--is known to precede subjects reports of their decision to move. Some view this as evidence against a causal role for consciousness in human decision-making and thus against free-will. Yet those studies focused on arbitrary decisions--purposeless, unreasoned, and without consequences. It remains unknown to what degree the RP generalizes to deliberate, more ecological decisions. We directly compared deliberate and arbitrary decision-making during a $1000-donation task to non-profit organizations. While we found the expected RPs for arbitrary decisions, they were strikingly absent for deliberate ones. Our results and drift-diffusion model are congruent with the RP representing accumulation of noisy, random fluctuations that drive arbitrary--but not deliberate--decisions. They further point to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary decisions, challenging the generalizability of studies that argue for no causal role for consciousness in decision-making to real-life decisions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe extent of human free will has been debated for millennia. Previous studies demonstrated that neural precursors of action--especially the readiness potential--precede subjects reports of deciding to move. Some viewed this as evidence against free-will. However, these experiments focused on arbitrary decisions--e.g., randomly raising the left or right hand. We directly compared deliberate (actual $1000 donations to NPOs) and arbitrary decisions, and found readiness potentials before arbitrary decisions, but--critically--not before deliberate decisions. This supports the interpretation of readiness potentials as byproducts of accumulation of random fluctuations in arbitrary but not deliberate decisions and points to different neural mechanisms underlying deliberate and arbitrary choice. Hence, it challenges the generalizability of previous results from arbitrary to deliberate decisions.",

    "abstract": "SummaryRegulatory changes are broadly accepted as key drivers of phenotypic divergence. However, identifying regulatory changes that underlie human-specific traits has proven very challenging. Here, we use 63 DNA methylation maps of ancient and present-day humans, as well as of six chimpanzees, to detect differentially methylated regions that emerged in modern humans after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans. We show that genes affecting the face and vocal tract went through particularly extensive methylation changes. Specifically, we identify widespread hypermethylation in a network of face- and voice-affecting genes (SOX9, ACAN, COL2A1, NFIX and XYLT1). We propose that these repression patterns appeared after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans, and that they might have played a key role in shaping the modern human face and vocal tract.View Full Text",

Light-sheet microscopy allows observation of the full course of embryonic development from egg to larva. Bringing the two approaches together allows unparalleled precision into the temporal regulation of signaling pathways and cellular processes in vivo. To develop this method, we investigated the regulation of canonical Wnt signaling during anterior-posterior patterning of the Drosophila embryonic epidermis. Cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) from Arabidopsis Thaliana was fused to mCherry fluorescent protein and Drosophila {beta}-catenin to form an easy to visualize optogenetic switch. Blue light illumination caused oligomerization of the fusion protein and inhibited downstream Wnt signaling in vitro and in vivo. Temporal inactivation of {beta}-catenin confirmed that Wnt signaling is required not only for Drosophila pattern formation, but also for maintenance later in development. We anticipate that this method will be easily extendable to other developmental signaling pathways and many other experimental systems.",

Yet, for HPVs, as for many other oncoviruses, there is a striking gap between our detailed understanding of chronic infections and our limited data on the early stages of infection. Here we argue that studying HPV acute infections is necessary and timely. Focusing on early interactions will help explain why certain infections are cleared while others become chronic or latent. From a molecular perspective, descriptions of immune effectors and pro-inflammatory pathways during the initial stages of infections have the potential to lead to novel treatments or to improved handling algorithms. From a dynamical perspective, adopting concepts from spatial ecology, such as meta-populations or meta-communities, can help explain why HPV acute infections sometimes last for years. Furthermore, cervical cancer screening and vaccines impose novel iatrogenic pressures on HPVs, implying that anticipating any viral evolutionary response remain essential. Finally, hints at the associations between HPV acute infections and fertility deserve further investigation given their high worldwide prevalence. Overall, understanding asymptomatic and benign infections may be instrumental in reducing HPV virulence.",

Addressing these issues, we present Scikit-ribo (https://github.com/hanfang/scikit-ribo), the first open-source software for accurate genome-wide A-site prediction and translation efficiency (TE) estimation from Riboseq and RNAseq data. Scikit-ribo accurately identifies A-site locations and reproduces codon elongation rates using several digestion protocols (r = 0.99). Next we show commonly used RPKM-derived TE estimation is prone to biases, especially for low-abundance genes. Scikit-ribo introduces a codon-level generalized linear model with ridge penalty that correctly estimates TE while accommodating variable codon elongation rates and mRNA secondary structure. This corrects the TE errors for over 2000 genes in S. cerevisiae, which we validate using mass spectrometry of protein abundances (r = 0.81) and allows us to determine the Kozak-like sequence directly from Riboseq. We conclude with an analysis of coverage requirements needed for robust codon-level analysis, and quantify the artifacts that can occur from cycloheximide treatment.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization and gene flow between species appears to be common. Even though it is clear that hybridization is widespread across all surveyed taxonomic groups, the magnitude and consequences of introgression are still largely unknown. Thus it is crucial to develop the statistical machinery required to uncover which genomic regions have recently acquired haplotypes via introgression from a sister population. We developed a novel machine learning framework, called FILET (Finding Introgressed Loci via Extra-Trees) capable of revealing genomic introgression with far greater power than competing methods. FILET works by combining information from a number of population genetic summary statistics, including several new statistics that we introduce, that capture patterns of variation across two populations. We show that FILET is able to identify loci that have experienced gene flow between related species with high accuracy, and in most situations can correctly infer which population was the donor and which was the recipient. Here we describe a data set of outbred diploid Drosophila sechellia genomes, and combine them with data from D. simulans to examine recent introgression between these species using FILET. Although we find that these populations may have split more recently than previously appreciated, FILET confirms that there has indeed been appreciable recent introgression (some of which might have been adaptive) between these species, and reveals that this gene flow is primarily in the direction of D. simulans to D. sechellia.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYUnderstanding the extent to which species or diverged populations hybridize in nature is crucially important if we are to understand the speciation process. Accordingly numerous research groups have developed methodology for finding the genetic evidence of such introgression. In this report we develop a supervised machine learning approach for uncovering loci which have introgressed across species boundaries. We show that our method, FILET, has greater accuracy and power than competing methods in discovering introgression, and in addition can detect the directionality associated with the gene flow between species. Using whole genome sequences from Drosophila simulans and Drosophila sechellia we show that FILET discovers quite extensive introgression between these species that has occurred mostly from D. simulans to D. sechellia. Our work highlights the complex process of speciation even within a well-studied system and points to the growing importance of supervised machine learning in population genetics.",

    "abstract": "Memory is stored in neural networks via changes in synaptic strength mediated in part by NMDA-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP). There is evidence that entorhinal cortex enables neocortical neuroplasticity through cholecystokinin (CCK)-containing neocortical projections. Here we show that a CCKB antagonist blocks high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP in the auditory cortex, whereas local infusion of CCK induces LTP. CCK-/- mice lacked neocortical LTP and showed deficits in a cue-cue associative learning paradigm; administration of CCK rescued associative learning. HFS of CCK-containing entorhino-neocortical projection neurons in anesthetized mice enabled cue-cue associative learning. Furthermore, when one cue was pre-conditioned to footshock, the mouse showed a freezing response to the other cue, indicating that the mice had formed an association. HFS-induced neocortical LTP was completely blocked by either NMDA antagonist or CCK-BR antagonist, while application of either NMDA or CCK induced LTP after low-frequency stimulation (LFS). Moreover, in the presence of CCK LTP was still induced, even after blockade of NMDA receptors. Local application of NMDA induced CCK release in the neocortex. To identify how NMDA receptor switches LTP, a stimulation protocol of 25 pulse-pairs was adopted to replace HFS; NMDA-dependent LTP was induced with the inter-pulse intervals between 10 and 100 ms, but not with those of 5 and 200 ms. LTP-mediated plasticity was linked to localization of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2a on cortical CCK terminals originating in the entorhinal cortex. These novel findings suggest that presynaptic NMDA receptors on CCK terminals control the release of CCK, which enables neocortical LTP and formation of cue-cue associative memory.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryPresynaptic NMDA receptors switches the release of CCK from entorhinal neurons, which enables neocortical LTP and formation of sound-sound associative memory.",

These physiological and behavioral effects may depend differentially on NMDAR subtype-and region-specific effects. The dramatic electrophysiological signatures of NMDAR blockade in rodents include potentiated high frequency oscillations (HFOs, ~140 Hz), likely generated in mesolimbic structures, and increased HFO phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), a phenomenon related to goal-directed behavior and dopaminergic tone. This study examined the impact of subtype-specific NMDAR antagonism on HFOs and PAC. We found that positive-symptom-associated NR2A-preferring antagonism (NVP-AAM077), but not NR2B-specific antagonism (Ro25-6985) or saline control, replicated increases in HFO power seen with nonspecific antagonism (MK-801).

Signaling proteins can form steep gradients in the cytosol, which cause strong cell size dependence. We show that the kinetics at the membrane-cytosolic interface and the ratio of cell membrane area to the enclosed cytosolic volume change the behavior of signaling cascades significantly.

    "abstract": "Existing1drug discovery process follows a reductionist model of \\\"one-drug-one-gene-one-disease,\\\" which is not adequate to tackle complex diseases that involve multiple malfunctioned genes. The availability of big omics data offers new opportunities to transform the drug discovery process into a new paradigm of systems pharmacology that focuses on designing drugs to target molecular interaction networks instead of a single gene. Here, we develop a reliable multi-rank, multi-layered recommender system, ANTENNA, to mine large-scale chemical genomics and disease association data for the prediction of novel drug-gene-disease associations. ANTENNA integrates a novel tri-factorization based dual-regularized weighted and imputed One Class Collaborative Filtering (OCCF) algorithm, tREMAP, with a statistical framework that is based on Random Walk with Restart and can assess the reliability of a specific prediction. In the benchmark study, tREMAP clearly outperforms the single rank OCCF. We apply ANTENNA to a real-world problem: repurposing old drugs for new clinical indications that have yet had an effective treatment. We discover that FDA-approved drug diazoxide can inhibit multiple kinase genes whose malfunction is responsible for many diseases including cancer, and kill triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells effectively at a low concentration (IC50 = 0.87 M). The TNBC is a deadly disease that currently does not have effective targeted therapies. Our finding demonstrates the power of big data analytics in drug discovery, and has a great potential toward developing a targeted therapy for the effective treatment of TNBC.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been found to improve working memory (WM) performance in healthy participants following a single session. However, results are mixed and the overall effect size is small. Interpretation of these results is confounded by heterogeneous study designs, including differences in tDCS dose (current intensity) and sham conditions used.\\n\\nAimsWe systematically investigated the effect of tDCS dose on working memory using behavioural and neurophysiological outcomes.\\n\\nMethodsIn a single-blind parallel group design, 100 participants were randomised across five groups to receive 15 minutes of bifrontal tDCS at different current intensities (2mA, 1mA, and three sham tDCS conditions at 0.034mA, 0.016mA, or 0mA). EEG activity was acquired while participants performed a WM task prior to, during, and following tDCS. Response time, accuracy and an event-related EEG component (P3) were evaluated.\\n\\nResultsWe found no significant differences in response time or performance accuracy between current intensities. The P3 amplitude was significantly lower in the 0mA condition compared to the 0.034mA, 1mA and 2mA tDCS conditions. Changes in WM accuracy were moderately correlated with changes in the P3 amplitude following tDCS compared to baseline levels (r = 0.34).\\n\\nConclusionsWorking memory was not significantly altered by tDCS, regardless of dose. The P3 amplitude showed that stimulation at 1mA, 2mA and a sham condition (0.034mA) had biological effects, with the largest effect size for 1mA stimulation. These findings indicate higher sensitivity of neurophysiological outcomes to tDCS and suggests that sham stimulation previously considered inactive may alter neuronal function.",

    "abstract": "The Colorado potato beetle is one of the most challenging agricultural pests to manage. It has shown a spectacular ability to adapt to a variety of solanaceaeous plants and variable climates during its global invasion, and, notably, to rapidly evolve insecticide resistance. To examine evidence of rapid evolutionary change, and to understand the genetic basis of herbivory and insecticide resistance, we tested for structural and functional genomic changes relative to other arthropod species using genome sequencing, transcriptomics, and community annotation. Two factors that might facilitate rapid evolutionary change include transposable elements, which comprise at least 17% of the genome and are rapidly evolving compared to other Coleoptera, and high levels of nucleotide diversity in rapidly growing pest populations. Adaptations to plant feeding are evident in gene expansions and differential expression of digestive enzymes in gut tissues, as well as expansions of gustatory receptors for bitter tasting. Surprisingly, the suite of genes involved in insecticide resistance is similar to other beetles. Finally, duplications in the RNAi pathway might explain why Leptinotarsa decemlineata has high sensitivity to dsRNA. The L. decemlineata genome provides opportunities to investigate a broad range of phenotypes and to develop sustainable methods to control this widely successful pest.",

Though a very common compound, little is known about its therapeutic value, mechanisms and effective doses. This study investigates into its therapeutic value and autophagy as a possible mechanism.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsWe evaluated the potency of BA treatment in seven different cell lines. We hypothesized that autophagy is involved in the mechanism of BA toxicity in tumor cells based on observations in plants, insects and cancer cell lines. Changes in autophagy-related proteins were measured after BA treatment. Finally, we suspected that blockage of autophagy would increase the effectiveness of BA treatment and enable the use of smaller doses.\\n\\nResultsOur results demonstrate that all studied cell lines did not suffer mortality in low to medium doses of BA (up to 5mM). However, a high dose (over 25mM) could inflict significant death in all cell lines. Those high doses caused P62/SQSTM1 consumption and LC3II-B accumulation after 3 days of treatment. Using small doses of BA in combination with autophagy blockage did not improve cytotoxicity in lung cancer cell lines.\\n\\nConclusionWe conclude that high concentrations of BA affect autophagy in short-term treatments. Not enough data is available about BA toxicity, so BA use as cancer treatment can be possible if new toxicity studies are performed.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveRecent research has shown that auditory closed-loop stimulations can enhance sleep slow oscillations (SO) to improve N3 sleep quality and cognition. Previous studies have been conducted in a lab environment and on a small sample size. The present study aimed at validating and assessing the performance of a novel ambulatory wireless dry-EEG device (WDD), for auditory closed-loop stimulations of SO during N3 sleep at home.\\n\\nMaterial and MethodsThe performance of the WDD to detect N3 sleep automatically and to send auditory closed-loop stimulations on SO were tested on 20 young healthy subjects who slept with both the WDD and a miniaturized polysomnography (part 1) in both stimulated and sham nights within a double blind, randomized and crossover design.\\n\\nThe electrophysiological effects of auditory closed-loop stimulation on delta power increase were assessed after 1 and 10 nights of stimulations on an observational pilot study in the home environment including 90 middle-aged subjects (part 2).\\n\\nResultsThe sensitivity and specificity of the WDD to automatically detect N3 sleep in real-time were 0.70 and 0.90, respectively. The stimulation accuracy of the SO ascending-phase targeting was 45{+/-}52{degrees}. The stimulation protocol induced an increase of 39.5 % of delta power after the stimulations. The increase of SO response to auditory stimulations remained at the same level after 10 consecutive nights.\\n\\nConclusionThe WDD shows good performances to automatically detect in real-time N3 sleep and to send auditory closed-loop stimulations on SO accurately. These stimulations increased the SO amplitude during N3 sleep without any adaptation effect after 10 consecutive nights. This tool provides new perspectives to figure out novel sleep EEG biomarkers in longitudinal studies and can be interesting to conduct broad studies on the effects of auditory stimulations during sleep.",

This investigation sheds new insight into dynamic relationship of cells with their surrounding environment in tumors and 3D multicellular cultures.\\n\\nNanotechnology has revolutionized the field of cancer biology and has opened new avenues towards understanding nanomechanical variations in rapidly growing tumors. Over the last decade Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) has played an important role in understanding nanomechanical properties of various cancer cell lines. This study is focused on Lewis Lung Carcinoma Cell (LLC) tumors as 3D multicellular spheroid (MS). Such multicellular structures have enabled investigation of various components of tumors in-vitro. To better comprehend mechanical properties of cells and its surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), depth dependent indentation measurements were conducted with Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). Force-vs-indentation curves were used to create stiffness profiles as function of depth. Here studies were focused on outer most layer i.e. proliferation zone of the spheroid. AFM investigations of sample a MS revealed three nanomechanical topographies, Type A- high modulus due to collagen stress fibers, Type B- high stiffness at cell membrane & ECM interface and Type C - increased modulus due to cell lying deep inside matrix at the a depth of 1.35 microns. Various nanomechanical heterogeneities revealed in this investigation can shed new light in developing correct dosage regime for various tumor dissolving drugs and designing more controlled artificial extracellular matrix systems for replicating tissue growth in-vitro.\\n\\nShort Statistical SummaryThis article describes nanomechanical characteristics of the cells embedded in extracellular matrix in a multicellular spheroid.

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research, the factors that maintain genetic variation for fitness are poorly understood. Mutation selection balance will always contribute to standing variance, but it is unclear what fraction of the variance in a typical fitness component can be explained by mutation-selection balance and whether fitness components differ in this respect. In theory, the level of standing variance in fitness due to mutation-selection balance can be predicted using the rate of fitness decline under mutation accumulation, and this prediction can be directly compared to the actual standing variance observed. This approach allows for controlled statistical tests of the sufficiency of the mutation-selection balance model, and could be used to identify traits or populations where genetic variance is maintained by factors beyond mutation-selection balance. For example, some traits may be influenced by sexually antagonistic balancing selection, resulting in an excess of standing variance beyond that generated by deleterious mutations. To encourage the application of this approach, we describe the underlying theory and use it to test the mutation selection balance model for three traits in Drosophila melanogaster. We find some evidence for non-mutational variance in male mating success and female fecundity relative to larval viability, which is consistent with balancing selection on sexual fitness components. Finally, we discuss the theoretical and practical limitations to this approach, and discuss how to apply it successfully.",

In real data analysis, acommon allele, strongly confounded with population structure, is discovered to be associated with late flowering and slow maturation of the plant. The discovered genetic effect on flowering time is further replicated in independent datasets. Using Mendelian randomization analysis based on summary statistics from our GWAS and expression QTL scans, we predicted and replicated a candidate gene AT1G11560 that potentially causes this association.

We have analysed the life-cycle of OtV5, a lytic virus, using RNA-Seq from 12 time points of healthy or infected Ostreococcus tauri cells over a day/night cycle in culture. In the day, viral gene transcription remained low while host nitrogen metabolism gene transcription was initially strongly repressed for two successive time points before being induced for 8 hours, but in the night viral transcription increased steeply while host nitrogen metabolism genes were repressed and many host functions that are normally reduced in the night appeared to be compensated either by genes expressed from the virus or by increased expression of a subset of 4.4 % of the hosts genes. Some host cells lysed progressively during the night, but a larger proportion lysed the following morning. Our data suggest that the life-cycles of algal viruses mirror the diurnal rhythms of their hosts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHypertension is a worldwide public health issue with significant comorbidity and mortality. We aimed to identify urinary metabolic phenotypes associated with three healthy diets and to establish their relationship to blood pressure (BP).\\n\\nMethods and Results--24-h urine samples from 158 participants, with pre-hypertension and hypertension, consumed a carbohydrate-rich, a protein-rich and a monounsaturated fat-rich healthy diet (6-week per diet) in randomized order, were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Combinations of metabolites significantly associated with each diet were identified, and associations between these metabolites and cardiovascular disease risk were established. We found coherent responses to all three diets including increased excretion of metabolites originating from vegetables/fruits, protein, tryptophan metabolism and gut microbial-mammalian co-metabolism. Proline betaine (marker of citrus fruit) was significantly inversely associated with systolic BP; 4-cresyl sulfate (gut microbial metabolite) inversely correlated with both systolic and diastolic BP; and hippurate (gut microbial metabolite) - directly associated with reduced systolic BP.\\n\\nConclusionsVariation in metabolic phenotypes in response to specific diets may hold clues as to the mechanisms underlying inter-individual differences in dietary response. Stratification of individuals based on diet-specific urinary phenotypes highlights the feasibility for individualized approaches to dietary therapy for lowering BP.\\n\\nClinical Trial RegistrationThis intervention study is registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00051350",

    "abstract": "Procedural memories, such as for riding a bicycle, can be maintained without practice for long periods of time and are thought to be supported by the persistent reorganization of sensorimotor cortices (S1/M1). Whereas enhanced synaptic strength and structural changes accompany the learning of motor tasks, the persistent molecular modifications that store long-term procedural memories within specific layers of sensorimotor cortex have not been identified. The persistent increase in the autonomously active, atypical PKC isoform, PKM{zeta}, is a putative molecular mechanism for maintaining enhanced synaptic strength during long-term potentiation (LTP) and several forms of long-term memory. Here we examine whether persistent increases in PKM{zeta} store long-term memory for a reaching task in rat sensorimotor cortex that could reveal the sites of procedural memory storage. Perturbing PKM{zeta} synthesis with PKM{zeta} -antisense oligodeoxynucleotides or blocking atypical PKC activity with zeta inhibitory peptide (ZIP) in S1/M1 disrupts and erases the maintenance of long-term motor memories. Only memories that are maintained without daily reinforcement are affected, indicating atypical PKCs (via ZIP) and PKM{zeta} specifically (via antisense) stores consolidated long-term procedural memories. Analysis of changes in the amount of PKM{zeta} in S1/M1 reveals PKM{zeta} increases in layers II/III and V of both S1 and M1 cortices as performance improves to an asymptote during training. After storage for 1 month without reinforcement, the increase in M1 layer V but not other layers persists without decrement. Thus, the sustained increases in PKM{zeta} reveal that the persistent molecular changes storing long-term procedural memory are localized to the descending output layer of primary motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "The corneal micropocket angiogenesis assay is an experimental protocol for studying vessel network formation, or neovascularization, in vivo. The assay is attractive due to the ease with which the developing vessel network can be observed in the same animal over time. Measurements from the assay have been used in combination with mathematical modeling to gain insights into the mechanisms of angiogenesis. While previous modeling studies have adopted planar domains to represent the assay, the hemispherical shape of the cornea and asymmetric positioning of the angiogenic source can be seen to affect vascular patterning in experimental images. As such, we aim to better understand: i) how the geometry of the assay influences vessel network formation and ii) how to relate observations from planar domains to those in the hemispherical cornea. To do so, we develop a three-dimensional, off-lattice mathematical model of neovascularization in the cornea, using a spatially resolved representation of the assay for the first time. Relative to the detailed model, we predict that the adoption of planar geometries has a noticeable impact on vascular patterning, leading to increased vessel  merging, or anastomosis, in particular when circular geometries are adopted. Significant differences in the dynamics of diffusible aniogenesis simulators are also predicted between different domains. In terms of comparing predictions across domains, the  distance of the vascular front to the limbus metric is found to have low sensitivity to domain choice, while metrics such as densities of tip cells and vessels and  vascularized fraction are sensitive to domain choice. Given the widespread adoption and attractive simplicity of planar tissue domains, both in silico and in vitro, the differences identified in the present study should prove useful in relating the results of previous and future theoretical studies of neovascularization to in vivo observations in the cornea.\\n\\nAuthor summaryNeovascularization, or the formation of new blood vessels, is an important process in development, wound healing and cancer. The corneal micropocket assay is used to better understand the process and, in the case of cancer, how it can be controlled with drug therapies for improved patient outcomes. In the assay, the hemispherical shape of the cornea can influence the way the vessel network forms. This makes it difficult to directly compare results from experiments with the predictions of mathematical models or cell culture experiments, which are typically performed on flat substrates or planar matrices. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to investigate how the hemispherical shape of the cornea affects vessel formation and to identify how sensitive different measurements of neovascularization are to geometry.",

Here we present a model test system that combines advanced statistics, machine learning, and a database of 9862 characterized genetic systems to automatically quantify model accuracies, accept or reject mechanistic hypotheses, and identify areas for model improvement. We also introduce Model Capacity, a new information theoretic metric that enables correct model comparisons across datasets. We demonstrate the model test system by comparing six models of translation initiation rate, evaluating 100 mechanistic hypotheses, and uncovering new sequence determinants that control protein expression levels. We applied these results to develop a biophysical model of translation initiation rate with significant improvements in accuracy.

However, the complexity of circadian clocks in higher organisms has prevented a clear understanding of how natural environmental conditions affect circadian clocks and their physiological outputs. Here, we dissect the interaction between circadian regulation and responses to fluctuating light in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. We demonstrate that natural changes in light intensity substantially affect the expression of hundreds of circadian-clock-controlled genes, many of which are involved in key steps in metabolism. These changes in expression arise from control of RNA polymerase recruitment to promoters by circadian and light-responsive regulation of a network of transcription factors including RpaA and RpaB. Using phenomenological modeling constrained by our data, we reveal simple principles that underlie the small number of stereotyped responses of dusk circadian genes to changes in light.",

    "abstract": "Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated pathogenic yeast that can change the size of the cells during infection. In particular, this process can occur by enlarging the size of the capsule without modifying the size of the cell body, or by increasing the diameter of the cell body, which is normally accompanied by an increase of the capsule too. This last process leads to the formation of cells of an abnormal enlarged size denominated titan cells. Previous works characterized titan cell formation during pulmonary infection but research on this topic has been hampered due to the difficulty to obtain them in vitro. In this work, we describe in vitro conditions (low nutrient, serum supplemented medium at neutral pH) that promote the transition from regular to titan-like cells. Moreover, addition of azide and static incubation of the cultures in a CO2 enriched atmosphere favored cellular enlargement. This transition occurred at low cell densities, suggesting that the process was regulated by quorum sensing molecules and was independent of the cryptococcal serotype/species. Transition to titan-like cell formation was impaired by pharmacological inhibition of PKC and TOR signaling pathways. Mutants affected in capsule synthesis did not form titan-like cells. Analysis of the gene expression profile in titan-like cells indicated that they overexpressed membrane proteins and transporters, being the gene encoding the Cig1 mannoprotein involved in iron uptake from heme groups the gene most differentially expressed compared to cells of regular size. We also investigated the gene expression profile of titan-like cells isolated from mice, and observed that during infection these cells mainly overexpressed genes related to metabolism and respiration. In summary, our work provides a new alternative method to investigate titan cell formation devoid the bioethical problems that involve animal experimentation.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that has a significant incidence in HIV+ patients in particular, in Subsaharian Africa, Asia and South America. This yeast poses an excellent model to investigate fungal virulence because it develops many strategies to adapt to the host and evade the immune response. One of the adaptation mechanisms involves the formation of Titan Cells, which are yeast of an abnormal large size. However, research on these cells has been limited to in vivo studies (mainly in mice) because they were not reproducibly found in vitro. In this work, we describe several conditions that induce the appearance of cells that mimic titan cells, and that we denominated as titan-like cells. The main factor that induced titan-like cells was the addition of serum to nutrient limited media. This has allowed to easily performing new approaches to characterize several signaling pathways involved in their development. We found that the formation of these cells is regulated by quorum sensing molecules, and that pathways such as PKC and TOR kinases regulate the process of cellular enlargement. We have also to perform transcriptomic analysis, which led to the identification of new genes that could be involved in the process. This work will open different research lines that will contribute to the elucidation of the role of these cells during infection and on the development of cryptococcal disease.",

    "abstract": "The basal forebrain cholinergic system is widely assumed to control cortical functions via non-synaptic transmission of a single neurotransmitter, acetylcholine. Yet, using immune-electron tomographic, molecular anatomical, optogenetic and physiological techniques, we find that mouse hippocampal cholinergic terminals invariably establish synapses and their vesicles dock at synapses only. We demonstrate that these synapses do not co-release but co-transmit GABA and acetylcholine via different vesicles, whose release is triggered by distinct calcium channels. This co-transmission evokes fast composite postsynaptic potentials, which are mutually cross-regulated by presynaptic auto-receptors and display different short-term plasticity. The GABAergic component alone effectively suppresses hippocampal sharp wave-ripples and epileptiform activity. The synaptic nature of the forebrain cholinergic system with differentially regulated, fast, GABAergic and cholinergic co-transmission suggests a hitherto unrecognized level of synaptic control over cortical states. This novel model of hippocampal cholinergic neurotransmission could form the basis for alternative pharmacotherapies after cholinergic deinnervation seen in neurodegenerative disorders.\\n\\nSupplementary materials are attached after the main text.",

We developed a model to distinguish between microbial and host metabolites by stable isotope tracing using fully 13C-labelled live non-replicating Escherichia coli, differentiating 12C and 13C isotopes with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Hundreds of microbial compounds penetrated across 23 host tissues and fluids after intestinal exposure: subsequent 12C host metabolome signatures included lipidemia, reduced glycolysis and inflammation. Mucosal barrier maturation with transient microbial exposure increased early clearance of penetrant bacterial metabolites from the small intestine into the urine, independently of antibody induction. Induced antibodies curtailed microbial metabolite exposure at the intestinal surface, by accelerating intestinal bacterial transit into the colon where metabolite transport mechanisms are limiting.",

In light of recent successes in the reverse programming process there has been significant interest in quantifying the underlying landscape picture through the mathematics of gene regulatory networks. We investigate the role of time delays arising from multistep chemical reactions and epigenetic rearrangement on the cell differentiation landscape for a realistic two-gene regulatory network, consisting of selfpromoting and mutually inhibiting genes. Our work provides the first theoretical basis of the transdifferentiation process in the presence of delays, where one differentiated cell type can transition to another directly without passing through the undifferentiated state. Additionally, the interplay of time-delayed feedback and a time dependent chemical drive leads to long-lived oscillatory states in appropriate parameter regimes. This work emphasizes the important role played by time-delayed feedback loops in gene regulatory circuits and provides a framework for the characterization of epigenetic landscapes.",

QSM data was acquired from a cohort of mice (n=10) under both normoxic (medical air, 21% O2/ balance N), and hyperoxic conditions (100% O2). Susceptibility measurements were taken from large branches of the portal and hepatic vein under each condition and were used to calculate venous oxygen saturation in each vessel. Blood was extracted from the IVC of three mice under norm- and hyperoxic conditions, and oxygen saturation was measured using a blood gas analyser to act as a gold standard.

The hypo-inflammatory status, termed as  Compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS), was proposed to be the primary cause of sepsis-associated mortality. However, this paradiam changed in recent years since there was little evidence to support the linear model of host response and pathogenesis in sepsis. Currently held view is that both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory host responses are stimulated in an overlapping manner. In this study a robust statistical model to study the complex interplay of host cytokines in human sepsis has been developed to evaluate host responses in sepsis that contribute significantly to clinical pathology.\\n\\nMethodsTwentyseven cytokines/ chemokines were quantified in 139 sepsis patients and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was performed to assess differences in host responses in different categories of clinical severity. Partial least squares regression based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to assess interactions between different groups of cytokines and their contribution to clinical pathology. An array of 23 cytokines was analysed in a mouse model of endotoxemia and a similar mathematical model was constructed.\\n\\nResultsThe results of MANOVA demonstrated the ability of combined cytokine response to discriminate sepsis patients according to clinical severity or outcome. Structural equation modelling revealed strong positive association between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In human sepsis, anti-inflammatory cytokines emerged as a significant entity associated with clinical severity as assessed by APACHE II scores.\\n\\nConclusionPLS-SEM modeling of cytokine responses and APACHE II score in human sepsis revealed that anti-inflammatory molecules contribute significantly towards clinical severity. More critically, the model offers emperical evidence for failures of clinical trials conducted during the last two decades in which antagonists of inflammatory host responses for human Sepsis were used for sepsis. The model also provides credence to the notion that inflammatory and anti-inflammatory host responses occur concurrently in both experimental endotoxemia and in human sepsis.",

    "abstract": "Total fifteen phosphate solubilizing bacteria were isolated from rhizosphere soil of apple tree on Kings B medium belonging to genus Pseudomonas spp. They were characterized on the basis of morphological and biochemical characteristics. Preliminary selection as phosphate solubilizing bacteria were done on the basis of formation of transparent zone around the colony on Pikovskayas agar medium containing 0.5% triclcium phosphate (TCP). Maximum in vitro phosphate solubilization on Pikovskayas agar plates after 72h incubation at 28{degrees}C was shown by An-15-Mg (46 mm), whereas in case of broth, again this strain showed maximum tricalcium phosphate (TCP) solubilization (76 g/ml). The pH of each inoculated broth was recorded daily and dropped significantly (pH 7.0-3.99). All the Pseudomonas isolates were further evaluated for overall plant growth promoting traits. Greatest siderophore activity was exhibited by An-14-Mg (71.23 %SU) followed by An-15-Mg (70.12 %SU) which were statiscally at par with each other. Whereas, maximum IAA production was observed again in An-15-Mg (95 g/ml). This isolate also showed the maximum production of HCN and ammonia. 16S rDNA and phylogenetic analysis showed that strain An-15-Mg exhibits 99% level of similarity with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Therefore, it was designated as Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain An-15-Mg. HPLC analysis showed that the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain An-15-Mg produced maximum concentration of succinic acid, malonic, citric and malic acid with small amounts of schimic, quinic, tartaric, fumaric and lactic acids. The strain An-15-Mg possessed phosphate solubilization as major PGP trait along with different PGP traits. The potential phosphate solubilizing strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reported first time as PGPR which lives in close association with apple tree without harming the plant, therefore could be used as a promising phosphate solubilizer and biofertilizer in apple crop grown in high hills of Himachal Pradesh.\\n\\nAuthors contributionAll authors made significant efforts towards the completion of this research work and preparation of manuscript timely. Author Ranjna Sharma has done collection of soil samples of apple tree from two districts, isolation and characterization of phosphate solubilizing Pseudomonas isolates and their screening for different PGPTs, phenotypic characteriazation, 16S rRNA analysis and statistical analysis. Author S P Singh has done HPLC analysis at their institute. Author Ankita has done sequence analysis and phylogenetic tree preparation.

    "abstract": "Harnessing CRISPR-Cas9 technology has provided an unprecedented ability to modify genomic loci via DNA double-strand break (DSB) induction and repair. We have analyzed nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair induced by Cas9 in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and find that the orientation of binding of Cas9 and its guide RNA (gRNA) profoundly influences the pattern of insertion/deletions (indels) at the site of cleavage. A common indel created by Cas9 is a one base pair (+1) insertion that appears to result from Cas9 creating a 1-bp 5 overhang that is filled in by a DNA polymerase and ligated. The origin of +1 insertions was investigated by using two gRNAs with PAM sequences located on opposite DNA strands but designed to cleave the same sequence. These templated +1 insertions are dependent on the X-family DNA polymerase, Pol4. Deleting Pol4 also eliminated +2 and +3 insertions, which were biased toward homonucleotide insertions. Using inverted PAM (iPAM) sequences, we also found significant differences in overall NHEJ efficiency and repair profiles, suggesting that the binding of the Cas9::gRNA complex influences subsequent NHEJ processing. As with well-studied events induced by the site-specific HO endonuclease, CRISPR-Cas9 mediated NHEJ repair depends on the Ku heterodimer and DNA ligase 4. Cas9 events, however, are highly dependent on the Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 complex, independent of Mre11s nuclease activity. Inspection of the outcomes of a large number of Cas9 cleavage events in mammalian cells (van Overbeek et al., 2016) reveals a similar templated origin of +1 insertions in human cells, but also a significant frequency of similarly templated +2 insertions.",

Since the pathogenic stage of the parasite is restricted to blood, dual RNA-sequencing of host and parasite transcripts in blood can reveal their interactions at a systemic scale. Here we identify human and parasite gene expression associated with severe disease features in Gambian children. Differences in parasite load explained up to 99% of differential expression of human genes but only a third of the differential expression of parasite genes. Co-expression analyses showed a remarkable co-regulation of host and parasite genes controlling translation, and host granulopoiesis genes uniquely co-regulated and differentially expressed in severe malaria. Our results indicate that high parasite load is the proximal stimulus for severe P. falciparum malaria, that there is an unappreciated role for many parasite genes in determining virulence, and hint at a molecular arms-race between host and parasite to synthesise protein products.",

Whole genome sequencing approaches to apidly identify pathogens and predict antibiotic resistance phenotypes are becoming more feasible and may offer a way to reduce clinical test turnaround times compared to conventional culture-based methods, and in turn, improve patient outcomes. In this study, we use whole genome sequence data from 1668 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to develop a XGBoost-based machine learning model that accurately predicts minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for 20 antibiotics. The overall accuracy of the model, within {+/-}1 two-fold dilution factor, is 92%. Individual accuracies are[&ge;]90% for 15/20 antibiotics. We show that the MICs predicted by the model correlate with known antimicrobial resistance genes.

This study shows that machine learning can be used to build a complete in silico MIC prediction panel for K. pneumoniae and provides a framework for building MIC prediction models for other pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic function and plasticity requires a delicate balance between overall structural stability and the continuous rearrangement of the components that make up the presynaptic active zone and the postsynaptic density (PSD). Photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM) has provided a detailed view of the nanoscopic structure and organization of some of these synaptic elements. Still lacking, are tools to address the morphing and stability of such complexes at super-resolution. We describe an approach to quantify morphological changes and energetic states of multimolecular assemblies over time. With this method, we studied the scaffold protein gephyrin, which forms postsynaptic clusters that play a key role in the stabilization of receptors at inhibitory synapses. Postsynaptic gephyrin clusters exhibit an internal microstructure composed of nanodomains. We found, that within the PSD, gephyrin molecules continuously undergo spatial reorganization. This dynamic behavior depends on neuronal activity and cytoskeleton integrity. The proposed approach also allowed access to the effective energy responsible for the tenacity of the PSD despite molecular instability.\\n\\nSignificant statementSuper-resolution microscopy has become an important tool for the study of biological systems, allowing detailed, nano-scale structural reconstruction, single molecule tracking, particle counting, and interaction studies. However, quantification tools that take full advantage of the information provided by this technology are still lacking. We describe a novel quantification method to obtain information related to the size, directionality, dynamics, and stability of clustered structures from super-resolution microscopy. With this method, we studied the stability of gephyrin clusters, the main inhibitory scaffold protein. We found that gephyrin molecules continuously undergo reorganization based on neuronal activity and changes in the cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "The ER is a complex network of sheets and tubules that is continuously being remodeled. The relevance of this membrane dynamics is underscored by the fact that mutations in Atlastins (ATL), the ER fusion proteins in mammals, cause neurodegeneration. How defects in this process disrupt neuronal homeostasis is largely unknown. Here we show by EM volume reconstruction of transfected cells, neurons and patient fibroblasts that the HSAN-causing ATL3 mutants promote aberrant ER tethering hallmarked by bundles of laterally attached ER tubules. In vitro, these mutants cause excessive liposome tethering, recapitulating the results in cells. Moreover, ATL3 variants retain their dimerization-dependent GTPase activity, but are unable to promote membrane fusion, suggesting a defect on an intermediate step of the ATL3 functional cycle. Our data therefore show that the effects of ATL3 mutations on ER network organization stretch beyond a loss of fusion, shedding a new light on neuropathies caused by atlastin defects.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative PCR is the diagnostic pillar for clinical virology testing, and reference materials are necessary for accurate, comparable quantitation between clinical laboratories. Accurate quantitation of HHV-6 is important for detection of viral reactivation and inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 in immunocompromised patients. Reference materials in clinical virology commonly consist of laboratory-adapted viral strains that may be affected by the culture process. We performed next-generation sequencing to make relative copy number measurements at single nucleotide resolution of eight candidate HHV-6A and seven HHV-6B reference strains and DNA materials from the HHV-6 Foundation and Advanced Biotechnologies. 11 of 17 (65%) HHV6 candidate reference materials showed multiple copies of the origin of replication upstream of the U41 gene by next-generation sequencing. These large tandem repeats arose independently in culture-adapted HHV-6A and HHV-6B strains, measuring 1254 bp and 983 bp, respectively. Copy number measured between 4-10X copies relative to the rest of the genome. We also report the first interspecies recombinant HHV-6 strain with a HHV-6A GS backbone and >5.5kb region from HHV-6B Z29 from U41-U43 that covered the origin tandem repeat. Specific HHV-6A reference strains demonstrated duplication of regions at UL1/UL2, U87, and U89, as well as deletion in the U12-U24 region and U94/95 genes. HHV-6 strains derived from cord blood mononuclear cells from different labs on different continents revealed no copy number differences throughout the viral genome. These data indicate large origin tandem duplications are an adaptation of both HHV-6A and HHV-6B in culture and show interspecies recombination is possible within the Betaherpesvirinae.\\n\\nImportanceAnything in science that needs to be quantitated requires a standard unit of measurement. This includes viruses, for which quantitation increasingly determines definitions of pathology and guidelines for treatment. However, the act of making standard or reference material in virology can alter its very usefulness through genomic duplications, insertions, and rearrangements. We used deep sequencing to examine candidate reference strains for HHV-6, a ubiquitous human virus that can reactivate in the immunocompromised population and is integrated into the human genome in every cell of the body for 1% of people worldwide. We found large tandem repeats in the origin of replication for both HHV-6A and HHV-6B that are selected for in culture. We also found the first interspecies recombinant between HHV-6A and HHV-6B, a phenomenon that is well-known in alphaherpesviruses but to date has not been seen in betaherpesviruses. These data critically inform HHV-6 biology and the standard selection process.",

By developing an in vivo imaging system to measure cyclic GMP levels in intact tibia, we show that FGF-induced dephosphorylation of NPR2 decreases its guanylyl cyclase activity in growth plate chondrocytes in living bone. Thus FGF signaling lowers cyclic GMP in the growth plate, which counteracts bone elongation.

Here, we assess transcriptomic variation to unravel the evolutionary history of Gryllus rubens and Gryllus texensis, cryptic field cricket species with highly divergent mating behavior. We infer their demographic history and screen their transcriptomes for footprints of selection in the context of the inferred demography. We find strong support for a long history of bidirectional gene flow, which ceased during the late Pleistocene, and a bottleneck in G. rubens consistent with a peripatric origin of this species. Importantly, the demographic history has likely strongly shaped patterns of neutral genetic differentiation (empirical FST distribution). Concordantly, FST based selection detection uncovers a large number of outliers, likely comprising many false positives, echoing recent theoretical insights. Alternative genetic signatures of positive selection, informed by the demographic history of the sibling species, highlighted a smaller set of loci; many of these are candidates for controlling variation in mating behavior. Our results underscore the importance of demography in shaping overall patterns of genetic divergence and highlight that examining both demography and selection facilitates a more complete understanding of genetic divergence during speciation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEndogenous retroviruses (ERVs), which are responsible for 10% of spontaneous mouse mutations, are kept under control via several epigenetic mechanisms. The H3K9 histone methyltransferase SETDB1 is essential for ERV repression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs), with DNA methylation also playing an important role. It has been suggested that SETDB1 protects ERVs from TET- dependent DNA demethylation, but the relevance of this mechanism for ERV expression remains unclear. Moreover, previous studies have been performed in primed ESCs, which are not epigenetically or transcriptionally representative of preimplantation embryos.\\n\\nResultsWe used naive ESCs to investigate the role of SETDB1 in ERV regulation and, in particular, its relationship with TET-mediated DNA demethylation. Naive ESCs show an increased dependency on SETDB1 for ERV silencing when compared to primed ESCs, including at the highly mutagenic intracisternal A particles (IAPs). We found that, in the absence of SETDB1, TET2 activates IAP elements in a catalytic-dependent manner. Surprisingly, however, TET2 does not drive changes in DNA methylation levels at IAPs, suggesting that it regulates these transposons indirectly. Instead, SETDB1 depletion leads to a TET2-dependent loss of H4R3me2s, which is indispensable for IAP silencing during epigenetic reprogramming.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate a novel and unexpected role for SETDB1 in protecting IAPs from TET2-dependent histone arginine demethylation.",
