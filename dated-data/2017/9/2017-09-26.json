    "abstract": "Urbanization significantly alters natural ecosystems and has accelerated globally as humans move into dense urban centers. Urban wildlife populations are often highly fragmented by an inhospitable matrix of human infrastructure. Isolated populations may adapt in response to novel urban pressures, but few studies have found evidence of selection in urban environments. We used multiple approaches to examine signatures of selection in transcriptomes from white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) in New York City. We analyzed transcriptomes from 48 P. leucopus individuals from three urban and three rural populations for evidence of rapid local adaption in isolated urban habitats. We generated a dataset of 154,770 SNPs and analyzed patterns of genetic differentiation between urban and rural sites. We also used genome scans and genotype-by-environment (GEA) analyses to identify signatures of selection in a large subset of genes. Neutral demographic processes may create allele frequency patterns that are indistinguishable from positive selection. Thus, we accounted for demography by simulating a neutral SNP dataset under the inferred demographic history for the sampled P. leucopus populations to serve as a null model for outlier analysis. We then annotated outlier genes and further validated them by associating allele frequency differences with two urbanization variables: percent impervious surface and human population density. Many candidate genes were involved in metabolic functions, especially dietary specialization. A subset of these genes have well-established roles in metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates, including transport of cholesterol and desaturation of fatty acids. Our results reveal clear genetic differentiation between rural and urban sites that resulted from rapid local adaptation and drift in urbanizing habitats. The specific outlier loci that we identified suggest that populations of P. leucopus are using novel food resources in urban habitats and selection pressures are acting to change metabolic pathways. Our findings support the idea that cities represent novel ecosystems with a unique set of selective pressures.",

Replication in an independent cohort is shown. Most of the associations were tissue specific, suggesting context specificity of the trait etiology.

Here, we use multivariate information theory to explore the statistical dependencies between triplets of genes in single-cell gene expression datasets. We develop PIDC, a fast, efficient algorithm that uses partial information decomposition (PID) to identify regulatory relationships between genes. We thoroughly evaluate the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate that the higher order information captured by PIDC allows it to outperform pairwise mutual information-based algorithms when recovering true relationships present in simulated data. We also infer gene regulatory networks from three experimental single-cell data sets and illustrate how network context, choices made during analysis, and sources of variability affect network inference.

    "abstract": "Patient classification has widespread biomedical and clinical applications, including diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response prediction. A clinically useful prediction algorithm should be accurate, generalizable, be able to integrate diverse data types, and handle sparse data. A clinical predictor based on genomic data needs to be easily interpretable to drive hypothesis-driven research into new treatments. We describe netDx, a novel supervised patient classification framework based on patient similarity networks. netDx meets the above criteria and particularly excels at data integration and model interpretability. As a machine learning method, netDx demonstrates consistently excellent performance in a cancer survival benchmark across four cancer types by integrating up to six genomic and clinical data types. In these tests, netDx has significantly higher average performance than most other machine-learning approaches across most cancer types and its best model outperforms all other methods for two cancer types. In comparison to traditional machine learning-based patient classifiers, netDx results are more interpretable, visualizing the decision boundary in the context of patient similarity space. When patient similarity is defined by pathway-level gene expression, netDx identifies biological pathways important for outcome prediction, as demonstrated in diverse data sets of breast cancer and asthma. Thus, netDx can serve both as a patient classifier and as a tool for discovery of biological features characteristic of disease. We provide a software complete implementation of netDx along with sample files and automation workflows in R.",

    "abstract": "Both genetic variants and brain region abnormalities are recognized to play a role in cognitive decline. We explore the association between singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in linkage regions for Alzheimers disease and rates of decline in brain structure using data from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).\\n\\nIn an initial discovery stage, we assessed the presence of linear association between the minor allele counts of 75,845 SNPs in the Alzgene linkage regions and predicted rates of change in structural MRI measurements for 56 brain regions using an RV test. In a second, refinement stage, we reduced the number of SNPs using a bootstrap-enhanced sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) with a fixed tuning parameter. Each SNP was assigned an importance measure proportional to the number of times it was estimated to have a nonzero coefficient in repeated re-sampling from the ADNI-1 sample. We created refined lists of SNPs based on importance probabilities greater than 50% and 90%, respectively. In a third, validation stage, we assessed the multivariate association between these refined lists of SNPs and the rates of structural change in the independent ADNI-2 study dataset.\\n\\nThere was strong statistical evidence for linear association between the SNPs in the Alzgene linkage regions and the 56 imaging phenotypes in both the ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 samples (p < 0.0001). The bootstrap-enhanced SCCA identified 1,694 priority SNPs with importance probabilities > 50% and 22 SNPs with importance probabilities > 90%. The 1,694 prioritized SNPs in the ADNI-1 data were associated with imaging phenotypes in the ADNI-2 data (p = 0.0021).\\n\\nThis manuscript presents an analysis that addresses challenges in current imaging genetics studies such as biased sampling designs and highdimensional data with low-signal. Genes corresponding to priority SNPs having the highest contribution in the validation data have previously been implicated or hypothesized to be implicated in AD, including GCLC, IDE, and STAMBP1andFAS. We hypothesize that the effect sizes of the 1,694 SNPs in the priority set are likely small, but further investigation within this set may advance understanding of the missing heritability in late-onset Alzheimers disease.

This biological axiom has been developed and currently appears to be all the more complex. In this study, we modified CD by adding further species to the CD information flow and mathematically expressed CD within a dynamic framework by using Boolean network based on its present-day and 1965 editions. We show that the enhancement of the Dogma not only now entails a higher level of complexity, but it also shows a higher level of robustness, thus far more consistent with the nature of biological systems. Using this mathematical modeling approach, we put forward a logic-based expression of our conceptual view of molecular biology. Finally, we show that such biological concepts can be converted into dynamic mathematical models using a logic-based approach and thus may be useful as a framework for improving static conceptual models in biology.",

However, accumulating evidence suggests that iPSCs are heterogeneous in comparison with embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and that is attributed to various genetic and epigenetic states of donor cells. In the light of the discovery of cell-type specialized ribosomal protein composition, its role as the cells transit through different stages of reprogramming and when iPSCs differentiate into specialized cell-types has not been explored to understand its influence in the reprogramming and differentiation process and outcome. By re-analyzing the publicly available gene expression datasets among ESCs, various sources of iPSCs and somatic cells and by studying the ribosomal protein gene expression during different stages of reprogramming of somatic cells and different passages of established iPSCs we found distinct patterns of their expression across multiple cell-types. We experimentally validated these results on the cells undergoing reprogramming from human dermal fibroblasts. Finally, by comparing publicly available data from iPSCs, iPSCs derived specialized cells and its in vivo counterparts, we show alterations in ribosomal gene expression during differentiation of specialized cells from iPSCs which may have Implications in the context of ribosomopathies. Our results provide an informatics framework for researchers in efficient generation of iPSCs that are equivalent to ESCs.",

Because of the low amount of RNA present in a single cell, some genes may fail to be detected even though they are expressed; these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate, with simulated and real data, that the model and its associated estimation procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary normalization step.",

This primary ratchet can arise without appeal to specialized cognitive adaptations and is plausibly more widespread in animal societies. We use a simple model to highlight how simple forms of contingent social learning can create the primary ratchet effect, dramatically increasing the prevalence of adaptive, hard to invent behavior. We investigate some ways that demography may interact with the primary ratchet to generate patterns of cultural variation. As the primary ratchet may be common to many animal societies, its cognitive components and population dynamics provide a common foundation for the study of animal culture and a necessary foundation for understanding the origins of human cumulative culture.",

Here we provide evidence that working memory (WM) gating policies - a type of control policy required for internal control of WM during a task - constitute a form of abstract task knowledge that can be transferred across contexts. In two experiments, we report specific evidence for the transfer of selective WM gating policies across changes of task context. We show that this transfer is not tied to shared structure in S-R mappings, but instead in the dynamic structure of the task.

    "abstract": "Rodents lick to consume fluids. The reward value of ingested fluids is likely to be encoded by neuronal activity entrained to the lick cycle. Here, we investigated relationships between licking and reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex [MFC], a key cortical region for reward-guided learning and decision-making. Multi-electrode recordings of spike activity and field potentials were made in male rats as they performed an incentive contrast licking task. Rats received access to higher and lower value sucrose rewards over alternating 30 sec periods. They learned to lick persistently when higher value rewards were available and to suppress licking when lower value rewards were available. Spectral analysis of spikes and fields revealed evidence for reward value being encoded by the strength of phase-locking of a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm to the rats lick cycle. Recordings during the initial acquisition of the task found that the strength of phase-locking to the lick cycle was strengthened with experience. A modification of the task, with a temporal gap of 2 sec added between reward deliveries, found that the rhythmic signals persisted during periods of dry licking, a finding that suggests the MFC encodes either the value of the currently available reward or the vigor with which rats act to consume it. Finally, we found that reversible inactivations of the MFC in the opposite hemisphere eliminated the encoding of reward information. Together, our findings establish that a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm, generated by the rodent medial frontal cortex, is synchronized to rewarded actions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe cellular and behavioral mechanisms of reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex [MFC] have not been resolved. We report evidence for a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm that is generated by the MFC and synchronized with ongoing consummatory actions. Previous studies of MFC reward signaling have inferred value coding upon temporally sustained activity during the period of reward consumption. Our findings suggest that MFC activity is temporally sustained due to the consumption of the rewarding fluids, and not necessarily the abstract properties of the rewarding fluid. Two other major findings were that the MFC reward signals persist beyond the period of fluid delivery and are generated by neurons within the MFC.",

Sequencing these repetitive regions is challenging, even with recent improvements in sequencing technologies. Among these repeats, a haplotype of the telomeric sequence and shortening of the D4Z4 array on human chromosome 4q35 causes one of the most prevalent forms of muscular dystrophy with autosomal-dominant inheritance, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD). Here, we applied a nanopore-based ultra-long read sequencer to sequence a BAC clone containing 13 D4Z4 repeats and flanking regions. We successfully obtained the whole D4Z4 repeat sequence, including the pathogenic gene DUX4 in the last D4Z4 repeat. The estimated sequence accuracy of the total repeat region was 99.7% based on a comparison with the reference sequence. Errors were typically observed between purine or between pyrimidine bases. Further, we analyzed the D4Z4 sequence from publicly available ultra-long whole human genome sequencing data obtained by nanopore sequencing. This technology may become a new standard for the molecular diagnosis of FSHD in the future and has the potential to widen our understanding of subtelomeric regions.",

This investigation sheds new insight into dynamic relationship of cells with their surrounding environment in tumors and 3D multicellular cultures.\\n\\nNanotechnology has revolutionized the field of cancer biology and has opened new avenues towards understanding nanomechanical variations in rapidly growing tumors. Over the last decade Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) has played an important role in understanding nanomechanical properties of various cancer cell lines. This study is focused on Lewis Lung Carcinoma Cell (LLC) tumors as 3D multicellular spheroid (MS). Such multicellular structures have enabled investigation of various components of tumors in-vitro. To better comprehend mechanical properties of cells and its surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), depth dependent indentation measurements were conducted with Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). Force-vs-indentation curves were used to create stiffness profiles as function of depth. Here studies were focused on outer most layer i.e. proliferation zone of the spheroid. AFM investigations of sample a MS revealed three nanomechanical topographies, Type A- high modulus due to collagen stress fibers, Type B- high stiffness at cell membrane & ECM interface and Type C - increased modulus due to cell lying deep inside matrix at the a depth of 1.35 microns. Various nanomechanical heterogeneities revealed in this investigation can shed new light in developing correct dosage regime for various tumor dissolving drugs and designing more controlled artificial extracellular matrix systems for replicating tissue growth in-vitro.\\n\\nShort Statistical SummaryThis article describes nanomechanical characteristics of the cells embedded in extracellular matrix in a multicellular spheroid.

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are primary regulators of gene expression in cells, where they bind specific genomic target sites to control transcription. Quantitative measurements of TF-DNA binding energies can improve the accuracy of predictions of TF occupancy and downstream gene expression in vivo and further shed light on how transcriptional networks are rewired throughout evolution. Here, we present a novel sequencing-based TF binding assay and analysis pipeline capable of providing quantitative estimates of binding energies for more than one million DNA sequences in parallel at high energetic resolution. Using this platform, we measured the binding energies associated with all possible combinations of 10 nucleotides flanking the known consensus DNA target for two model yeast TFs, Pho4 and Cbf1. A large fraction of these flanking mutations change overall binding energies by an amount equal to or greater than consensus site mutations, suggesting that current definitions of TF binding sites may be too restrictive. By systematically comparing estimates of binding energies output by deep neural networks (NN) and biophysical models trained on these data, we establish that dinucleotide specificities are sufficient to explain essentially all variance in observed binding behavior, with Cbf1 binding exhibiting significantly more epistasis than Pho4. NN-derived binding energies agree with orthogonal biochemical measurements and reveal that dynamically occupied sites in vivo are both energetically and mutationally distant from the highest-affinity sites.",

    "abstract": "Computational methods for identification of cell populations from high-dimensional flow cytometry data are changing the paradigm of cytometry bioinformatics. Data clustering is the most common computational approach to unsupervised identification of cell populations from multidimensional cytometry data. We found that combining recursive filtering and clustering with constraints converted from the user manual gating strategy can effectively identify overlapping and rare cell populations from smeared data that would have been difficult to resolve by either a single run of data clustering or manual segregation. We named this new method DAFi: Directed Automated Filtering and Identification of cell populations. Design of DAFi preserves the data-driven characteristics of unsupervised clustering for identifying novel cell-based biomarkers, but also makes the results interpretable to experimental scientists as in supervised classification through mapping and merging the high-dimensional data clusters into the user-defined 2D gating hierarchy. By recursive data filtering before clustering, DAFi can uncover small local clusters which are otherwise difficult to identify due to the statistical interference of the irrelevant major clusters. Quantitative assessment of cell type specific characteristics demonstrates that the population proportions calculated by DAFi, while being highly consistent with those by expert centralized manual gating, have smaller technical variance than those from individual manual gating analysis. Visual examination of the dot plots showed that the boundaries of the DAFi-identified cell populations followed the natural shapes of the data distributions. To further exemplify the utility of DAFi, we show that DAFi can incorporate the FLOCK clustering method to identify novel cell-based biomarkers. Implementation of DAFi supports options including clustering, bisecting, slope-based gating, and reversed filtering to meet various auto-gating needs from different scientific use cases.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is a hallmark of cancer although the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly understood. To study the possible role of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in this process we analyzed the global and locus-specific genome-wide levels of 5hmC in primary samples from 54 gliomas and 72 colorectal cancer patients. Levels of 5hmC in colorectal cancer were very low and no consistent changes were detected between control tissues and tumors. As expected, levels of 5hmC in non-tumoral brain samples were high and significantly reduced at the 49,601 CpG sites in gliomas. Strikingly, hypo-hydroxymethylation at 4,627 (9.3%) of these CpG sites was associated with aberrant DNA hypermethylation. The DNA regions containing these CpG sites were enriched in H3K4me2, and presented a different genuine chromatin signature to that characteristic of the genes classically aberrantly hypermethylated in cancer. We conclude that this data identifies a novel 5hmC-dependent non-canonical class of aberrant DNA hypermethylation in glioma.",

In many recent transcriptome analyses based on RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), variations in gene expression levels among replicates were assumed to follow a negative binomial distribution although the physiological basis of this assumption remain unclear.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, RNA-seq data were obtained from Arabidopsis thaliana under eight conditions (21-27 replicates), and the characteristics of gene-dependent distribution profiles of gene expression levels were analyzed. For A. thaliana and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the distribution profiles could be described by a Gauss-power mixing distribution derived from a simple model of a stochastic transcriptional network containing a feedback loop. The distribution profiles of gene expression levels were roughly classified as Gaussian, power law-like containing a long tail, and mixed. The fitting function predicted that gene expression levels with long-tailed distributions would be strongly influenced by feedback regulation. Thus, the features of gene expression levels are correlated with their functions, with the levels of essential genes tending to follow a Gaussian distribution and those of genes encoding nucleic acid-binding proteins and transcription factors exhibiting long-tailed distributions.\\n\\nAvailabilityFastq files of RNA-seq experiments were deposited into the DNA Data Bank of Japan Sequence Read Archive as accession no.

It is still difficult to leverage this knowledge base in clinical practice as many reports lack strong statistical evidence or may include false associations. Clinical laboratories assess whether these variants (along with newly observed variants that are adjacent to these published ones) underlie clinical disorders.\\n\\nMaterials and Methods: We measured whether citation data--including journal impact factor and the number of cited variants (NCV) in each gene with published disease associations--can be used to improve variant assessment.\\n\\nResults: Surprisingly, we find that impact factor is not predictive of pathogenicity, but the NCV score for each gene can provide statistical support of pathogenicity. When combining this gene-level citation metric with variant-level evolutionary conservation and structural features, classification accuracy reaches 89.5%. Further, variants identified in clinical exome sequencing cases have higher NCV scores than simulated rare variants from ExAC in matched genes and consequences (p<2.22x10-16).\\n\\nDiscussion: Aggregate citation data can complement existing variant-based predictive algorithms, and can boost their performance without accessing and reviewing large numbers of manuscripts.

    "abstract": "The degree of intrinsic and interpatient phenotypic heterogeneity and its role in tumour evolution is poorly understood. Phenotypic divergence can be achieved via the inheritance of alternative transcriptional programs1,2. Cell-type specific transcription is maintained through the activation of epigenetically-defined regulatory regions including promoters and enhancers1,3,4. In this work, we annotated the epigenome of 47 primary and metastatic oestrogen-receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer specimens from clinical samples, and developed strategies to deduce phenotypic heterogeneity from the regulatory landscape, identifying key regulatory elements commonly shared across patients. Highly shared regions contain a unique set of regulatory information including the motif for the transcription factor YY1. In vitro work shows that YY1 is essential for ER transcriptional activity and defines the critical subset of functional ER binding sites driving tumor growth in most luminal patients. YY1 also control the expression of genes that mediate resistance to endocrine treatment. Finally, we show that H3K27ac levels at active enhancer elements can be used as a surrogate of intra-tumor phenotypic heterogeneity, and to track expansion and contraction of phenotypic subpopulations throughout breast cancer progression. Tracking YY1 and SLC9A3R1 positive clones in primary and metastatic lesions, we show that endocrine therapies drive the expansion of phenotypic clones originally underrepresented at diagnosis. Collectively, our data show that epigenetic mechanisms significantly contribute to phenotypic heterogeneity and evolution in systemically treated breast cancer patients.",

Recently, an alternative ethical regulation strategy based on the installation of artificial breeding facilities has been tested in European cities.

According to authorities, this method allows to retain confined pigeons in this new habitat and to attract more conspecifics. This study aims at evaluating the efficiency and potential side-effects of this method by assessing pigeon fidelity behaviour and pigeon welfare after release. Results show that confinement in pigeon houses induced a significant body mass loss in birds. Only 19% of confined pigeons became faithful to their new habitat. This fidelity depended on the origin of birds suggesting that pigeons captured closer to the pigeon houses are more likely to stay in the vicinity of the pigeon house one year after.

Here, we present comprehensive surveys of birds and trees in primary forest and smallholder agricultural mosaics in northern Peru. These surveys reveal substantial biodiversity losses that have been overlooked by other studies. Avian biodiversity losses arise primarily from biotic homogenization across infrequently surveyed forest habitats (a loss of beta-diversity). Furthermore, tree species richness declines much more steeply than bird richness. Statistical modeling of local habitat features that allow forest-associated species to persist in the smallholder mosaic strongly suggests that our results represent a best-case scenario for Amazonian agricultural biodiversity. We conclude that previous assessments of the biodiversity value of Amazonian smallholder agriculture have been overly optimistic because they are restricted to upland habitat, thereby missing losses in beta diversity; do not evaluate trees; and/or rely on generalizations from less speciose areas of the Neotropics, where habitat specialization amongst species is less prevalent. Smallholder agriculture will likely expand in western Amazonia due to infrastructure development, and it must be seen as a serious threat to the regions biodiversity.",

We identified five major population clusters across Sub-Saharan Africa, which probably originated in East African Rift region and expanded throughout Africa in relation to host genus and abiotic factors such as climatic classifications. Using laboratory lines, we estimated the incompatibility between the different strains of Wolbachia infecting C. sesamiae. We observed an incompatibility between Wolbachia strains was asymmetric; expressed in one direction only. Based on these results, we assessed the relationships between direction of gene flow and Wolbachia infections in the genetic clusters. We found that Wolbachia-induced reproductive incompatibility was less influential than host specialization in the genetic structure. Both Wolbachia and host were more influential than geography and current climatic conditions. These results are discussed in the context of African biogeography, and co-evolution between Wolbachia, virus parasitoid and host, in the perspective of improving biological control efficiency through a better knowledge of the biodiversity of biological control agents.",

    "abstract": "Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder, with common genetic risk variants implicated in the clinical diagnosis and symptoms of ADHD. However, given evidence of comorbidity and genetic overlap across neurodevelopmental and externalizing conditions, it remains unclear whether these genetic risk variants are ADHD-specific. The aim of this study was to evaluate the associations between ADHD genetic risks and related neurodevelopmental and externalizing conditions, and to quantify the extent to which any such associations can be attributed to a general genetic liability towards psychopathology. We derived ADHD polygenic risk scores (PRS) for 13,460 children aged 9 and 12 years from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden, using results from an independent meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of ADHD diagnosis and symptoms. Associations between ADHD PRS, a latent general psychopathology factor, and six latent neurodevelopmental and externalizing factors were estimated using structural equation modelling. ADHD PRS were statistically significantly associated with elevated levels of inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, autistic traits, learning difficulties, oppositional-defiant, and conduct problems (standardized regression coefficients=0.07-0.12). Only the association with specific hyperactivity/impulsivity remained significant after accounting for a general psychopathology factor, on which all symptoms loaded positively (standardized mean loading=0.61, range=0.32-0.91). ADHD PRS simultaneously explained 1% (p-value<0.001) of the variance in the general psychopathology factor and 0.50% (p-value<0.001) in the specific hyperactivity/impulsivity factor. Our results suggest that common genetic risk variants associated with ADHD have largely general pleiotropic effects on neurodevelopmental and externalizing traits in the general population, in addition to a specific association with hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms.",

    "abstract": "In a conventional view of the prokaryotic genome organization promoters precede operons and RBS sites with Shine-Dalgarno consensus precede genes. However, recent experimental research suggesting a more diverse view motivated us to develop an algorithm with improved gene-finding accuracy. We describe GeneMarkS-2, an ab initio algorithm that uses a model derived by self-training for finding species-specific (native) genes, along with an array of pre-computed heuristic models designed to identify harder-to-detect genes (likely horizontally transferred). Importantly, we designed GeneMarkS-2 to identify several types of distinct sequence patterns (signals) involved in gene expression control, among them the patterns characteristic for leaderless transcription as well as non-canonical RBS patterns. To assess the accuracy of GeneMarkS-2 we used genes validated by COG annotation, proteomics experiments, and N-terminal protein sequencing. We observed that GeneMarkS-2 performed better on average in all accuracy measures when compared with the current state-of-the-art gene prediction tools. Furthermore, the screening of [~]5,000 representative prokaryotic genomes made by GeneMarkS-2 predicted frequent leaderless transcription in both archaea and bacteria. We also observed that the RBS sites in some species with leadered transcription did not necessarily exhibit the Shine-Dalgarno consensus. The modeling of different types of sequence motifs regulating gene expression prompted a division of prokaryotic genomes into five categories with distinct sequence patterns around the gene starts.\\n\\n[Supplemental material is available for this article].",

    "abstract": "The progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with marked alterations in circulating immune cell populations, but no studies have characterized alterations in these cell types across the full spectrum of lung function impairment in current and former smokers. In 6,299 subjects from the COPDGene and ECLIPSE studies, we related Coulter blood counts and proportions to cross-sectional FEV1 adjusting for current smoking status. We also related cell count measures to three-year change in FEV1 in ECLIPSE subjects. In a subset of subjects with blood gene expression data, we used cell type deconvolution methods to infer the proportions of immune cell subpopulations, and we related these to COPD clinical status. We observed that FEV1 levels are positively correlated with lymphocytes and negatively correlated with myeloid populations such as neutrophils and monocytes. In multivariate models, absolute cell counts and proportions were associated with cross-sectional FEV1, and lymphocytes, monocytes, and eosinophil counts were predictive of three-year change in lung function. Using cell type deconvolution to study immune cell subpopulations, we observed that subjects with COPD had a lower proportion of CD4+ resting memory cells and naive B cells compared to non-COPD smokers. Alterations in circulating immune cells in COPD support a mixed pattern of lymphocyte suppression and an enhanced myeloid cell immune response. Cell counts and proportions contribute independent information to models predicting lung function suggesting a critical role for immune response in long-term COPD outcomes. Cell type deconvolution is a promising method for immunophenotyping in large cohorts.",

Bacillus subtilis is one of the naturally competent bacterial species and the domesticated laboratory strain 168 is easily transformable. In this study, we report a reduced transformation frequency of B. subtilis mutants lacking functional and structural flagellar components. This includes hag, the gene encoding the flagellin protein forming the filament of the flagellum. We confirm that the observed decrease of the transformation frequency is due to reduced expression of competence genes, particularly of the main competence regulator comK. The impaired competence is due to an increase in the phosphorylated form of the response regulator DegU, which is involved in regulation of both flagellar motility and competence. Altogether, our study identified a close link between motility and natural competence in B. subtilis suggesting that hindrance in motility has great impact on differentiation of this bacterium not restricted only to the transition towards sessile growth stage.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance statementUnderstanding how versatile bacterial phenotypes influence each other is important for our basic understanding of microbial ecology.

    "abstract": "Mind wandering represents the human capacity for internally focussed thought, and relies upon the brains default network and its interactions with attentional networks. Studies have characterised mind wandering in healthy people, yet there is limited understanding of how this capacity is affected in clinical populations. This study used a validated thought-sampling task to probe mind wandering capacity in two neurodegenerative disorders: behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD; n=35) and Alzheimers disease (AD; n=24), compared to older controls (n=37). These patient groups were selected due to canonical structural and functional changes across sites of the default and frontoparietal networks, and well-defined impairments in cognitive processes that support mind wandering. Relative to controls, bvFTD patients displayed significantly reduced mind wandering capacity, offset by a significant increase in stimulus-bound thought. In contrast, AD patients demonstrated comparable levels of mind wandering to controls, in the context of a relatively subtle shift towards stimulus-/task-related forms of thought. In the patient groups, mind wandering was associated with grey matter integrity in the hippocampus/parahippocampus, striatum, insula and orbitofrontal cortex. Resting state functional connectivity revealed associations between mind wandering capacity and connectivity within and between regions of the frontoparietal and default networks, with distinct patterns evident in patients vs. controls. These findings support a relationship between altered mind wandering capacity in neurodegenerative disorders, and structural and functional integrity of the default and frontoparietal networks. This study highlights a dimension of cognitive dysfunction not well documented in neurodegenerative disorders, and validates current models of mind wandering in a clinical population.\\n\\nSignificance statementHumans spend much of their waking life engaged in mind wandering. Underlying brain systems supporting this complex ability have been established in healthy individuals, yet it remains unclear how mind wandering is altered in neuropsychiatric populations. We reveal changes in the thought profiles elicited during periods of low cognitive demand in dementia, resulting in reduced mind wandering and an increased propensity towards stimulus-bound thought. These altered thought profiles were associated with structural and functional brain changes in the hippocampus, default and frontoparietal networks; key regions implicated in internal mentation in healthy individuals. Our findings provide a unique clinical validation of current theoretical models of mind wandering, and reveal a dimension of cognitive dysfunction that has received scant attention in dementia.",

A third tone was not paired with any other stimulus and served as a standard (frequent stimulus) in a three-stimuli oddball paradigm. The larger posterior positivity (P3) to SON than DN, found in previous studies, was replicated in all experiments. Conditioning of the P3 response was albeit observed in two similar experiments (1 and 3), but the obtained effects were weak and not identical in the two experiments. Only Experiment 4, where the number of CS/UCS pairings and the Stimulus-Onset Asynchrony between CS and UCS were increased, showed clear CS+/CS- differences both in time and time-frequency domains. Surprisingly, differential responses to CS+ and CS- were also obtained in Experiment 2, although SON and DN in that experiment were masked and never consciously recognized as meaning words (recognition rate 0/63 participants). The results are discussed in the context of other ERP conditioning experiments and, particularly, the studies of non-conscious effect on ERP. Several further experiments are suggested to replicate and extend the present findings and to remove the remaining methodological limitations.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate olfactory placodes consists of a variety of neuronal populations, which are thought to have distinct embryonic origins. In the zebrafish, while ciliated sensory neurons arise from preplacodal ectoderm (PPE), previous lineage tracing studies suggest that both Gonadotropin releasing hormone 3 (Gnrh3) and microvillous sensory neurons derive from cranial neural crest (CNC). We find that the expression of Islet1/2 is restricted to Gnrh3 neurons associated with the olfactory placode. Unexpectedly, however, we find no change in Islet1/2+ cell numbers in sox10 mutant embryos, calling into question their CNC origin. Lineage reconstruction based on backtracking in time-lapse confocal datasets, and confirmed by photoconversion experiments, reveals that Gnrh3 neurons derive from the anterior/medial PPE. Similarly, all of the microvillous sensory neurons we have traced arise from preplacodal progenitors. Our results suggest that rather than originating from separate ectodermal populations, cell-type heterogeneity is generated from overlapping pools of progenitors within the preplacodal ectoderm.",

The dynamics are dominated by internal protein motions rather than rigid packing interactions.\\n\\nAbstractMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations of Bragg and diffuse X-ray scattering provide a means of obtaining experimentally validated models of protein conformational ensembles. This paper shows that, compared to a single periodic unit cell model, the accuracy in simulating diffuse scattering is increased when the crystal is modeled as a periodic supercell, consisting of a 2x2x2 layout of eight unit cells. The MD simulations capture the general dependence of correlations on the separation of atoms. There is substantial agreement between the simulated Bragg reflections and the crystal structure; there are local deviations, however, indicating both the limitation of using a single structure to model disordered regions of the protein and local deviations of the average structure away from the crystal structure. Although it was anticipated that a longer duration simulation might be required to achieve convergence of the diffuse scattering calculation using the supercell model, only a microsecond is required, the same as for the unit cell. Rigid protein motions only account for a small fraction of the variation in atom positions from the simulation. The results indicate that protein crystal dynamics can be dominated by internal motions rather than packing interactions, and that MD simulations can be combined with Bragg and diffuse X-ray scattering to model the protein conformational ensemble.",

The laboratory N2 strain and the wild isolate AB1 strain were utilized to examine how the genotype contributes to the transcriptome dynamics. Significant variations were found in the gene expressions between the \\\"domesticated\\\" laboratory strain and the wild isolate in the different environments. The results showed that 20% - 27% of the transcriptional responses to the environment changes were transmitted to the subsequent generation. In aquatic conditions, the domesticated strain showed differential gene expression particularly for the genes functioning in the reproductive system and the cuticle development. In accordance with the transcriptomic responses, phenotypic abnormalities were detected in the germline and cuticle of the domesticated strain. Further studies showed that distinct groups of genes are exclusively expressed under specific environmental conditions, and many of these genes previously lacked supporting biochemical evidence.",
