    "abstract": "Organ development is driven by a set of patterned inductive signals. However, how these signals are integrated to coordinate tissue patterning is still poorly understood. Calcium ions (Ca2+) are critical signaling components involved in signal integration and are regulated by a core Ca2+ signaling toolkit. Ca2+ signaling encodes a significant fraction of information in cells through both amplitude and frequency-dependent regulation of transcription factors and key regulatory enzymes. A range of intercellular Ca2+ transients, including coordinated oscillations, recently have been reported in Drosophila wing discs. In an accompanying paper, we show that impaired Ca2+ signaling impacts the final size and shape of the wing. Here, we discover specific spatiotemporal signatures of Ca2+ transients during wing disc development. To do so, we developed a new neural-network-based approach for registration of oscillatory signals in organs that frequently move during imaging, and a pipeline for spatiotemporal analysis of intercellular Ca2+ oscillations. As a specific test case, we further demonstrated that the morphogen pathway, Hedgehog, controls frequencies of Ca2+ oscillations uniformly in the tissue and is required for spatial patterning of oscillation amplitudes. Thus, the time-averaged dynamics of spontaneous intercellular Ca2+ transients reflect the morphogenetic signaling state of the tissue during development. This suggests a general mechanism of physiological signaling that provides a memory of morphogenetic patterns. Additionally, our study provides a powerful approach for registering and quantifying oscillatory dynamics in developing organs.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR genome editing experiments offer enormous potential for the evaluation of genomic loci using arrayed single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) or pooled sgRNA libraries. Numerous computational tools are available to help design sgRNAs with optimal on-target efficiency and minimal off-target potential. In addition, computational tools have been developed to analyze deep sequencing data resulting from genome editing experiments. However, these tools are typically developed in isolation and oftentimes not readily translatable into laboratory-based experiments. Here we present a protocol that describes in detail both the computational and benchtop implementation of an arrayed and/or pooled CRISPR genome editing experiment. This protocol provides instructions for sgRNA design with CRISPOR, experimental implementation, and analysis of the resulting high-throughput sequencing data with CRISPResso. This protocol allows for design and execution of arrayed and pooled CRISPR experiments in 4-5 weeks by non-experts as well as computational data analysis in 1-2 days that can be performed by both computational and non-computational biologists alike.",

The functional mechanisms and the neural bases of this phenomenon remain debated. Here we present FORTIOR, a model of the cortical control of visual IOR in the human brain. The model is based on known facts about the anatomical and functional organization of fronto-parietal attention networks, and accounts for a broad range of behavioral findings in healthy participants and brain-damaged patients. FORTIOR does that by combining four principles of asymmetry: O_LIAsymmetry in the networks topography, whereby the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) nodes are lateralized to the right hemisphere, causing higher activation levels in the right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and frontal eye field (FEF) nodes.\\nC_LIO_LIAsymmetry in inter-hemispheric connectivity, in which inter-hemispheric connections from left hemisphere IPS to right hemisphere IPS and from left hemisphere FEF to right hemisphere FEF are weaker than in the opposite direction.\\nC_LIO_LIAsymmetry of visual inputs, stipulating that the FEF receives direct visual input coming from the ipsilateral visual cortex, while the right TPJ and vlPFC and IPS nodes receive input from both the contralateral and the ipsilateral visual fields.\\nC_LIO_LIAsymmetry in the response modality, with a higher response threshold for the manual response system than that required to trigger a saccadic response.

However, a significant proportion of identified genetic variants are actually false positive calls, and this pose serious challenges for variants interpretation. Here, we propose a new tool named GARFIELD-NGS (Genomic vARiants FIltering by dEep Learning moDels in NGS), which rely on deep learning models to dissect false and true variants in exome sequencing experiments performed with Illumina or ION platforms. GARFIELD-NGS showed strong performances for both SNP and INDEL variants (AUC 0.71 - 0.98) and outperformed established hard filters. The method is robust also at low coverage down to 30X and can be applied on data generated with the recent Illumina two-colour chemistry. GARFIELD-NGS processes standard VCF file and produces a regular VCF output. Thus, it can be easily integrated in existing analysis pipeline, allowing application of different thresholds based on desired level of sensitivity and specificity.\\n\\nAvailabilityGARFIELD-NGS available at https://github.com/gedoardo83/GARFIELD-NGS\\n\\nContactedoardo.giacopuzzi@unibs.it",

Analysis-based normalisation methods were developed for transcriptomic data and these are dependent on the underlying assumption that total transcription does not change between conditions. For genome-wide changes in transcription factor binding, these assumptions do not hold true. The challenges in normalisation are confounded by experimental variability during sample preparation, processing, and recovery.\\n\\nWe present a novel normalisation strategy utilising an internal standard of unchanged peaks for reference. Our method can be readily applied to monitor genome-wide changes by ChIP-seq that are otherwise lost or misrepresented through analytical normalisation. We compare our approach to normalisation by total read depth and two alternative methods that utilise external experimental controls to study transcription factor binding. We successfully resolve the key challenges in quantitative ChIP-seq analysis and demonstrate its application by monitoring the loss of Estrogen Receptor-alpha (ER) binding upon fulvestrant treatment, ER binding in response to estrodiol, ER mediated change in H4K12 acetylation and profiling ER binding in Patient-Derived Xenographs. This is supported by an adaptable pipeline to normalise and quantify differential transcription factor binding genome-wide and generate metrics for differential binding at individual sites.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/182261_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (46K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@177285borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa7d79org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@43d17forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6eff8d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOGRAPHICAL ABSTRACTC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Intra-tumor heterogeneity is one of the key confounding factors in deciphering tumor evolution. Malignant cells will have variations in their gene expression, copy numbers, and mutation even when coming from a single tumor. Single cell sequencing of tumor cells is of paramount importance for unmasking the underlying the tumor heterogeneity. However extracting features from the single cell genomic data coherent with the underlying biology is computationally challenging, given the extremely noisy and sparse nature of the data. Here we are proposing  Dhaka a variational autoencoder based single cell analysis tool to transform genomic data to a latent encoded feature space that is more efficient in differentiating between the hidden tumor subpopulations. This technique is generalized across different types of genomic data such as copy number variation from DNA sequencing and gene expression data from RNA sequencing. We have tested the method on two gene expression datasets having 4K to 6K tumor cells and two copy number variation datasets having 250 to 260 tumor cells. Analysis of the encoded feature space revealed sub-populations of cells bearing distinct genomic signatures and the evolutionary relationship between them, which other existing feature transformation methods like t-SNE and PCA fail to do.",

    "abstract": "Whether intraspecific interactions are facilitative or competitive may change across individual ontogeny. In plant-feeding insects, the direction of this interaction is likely to be mediated by host plant defenses. Here I conducted two experiments looking at the direct effect of a physical seed defense and the role of intraspecific facilitation in reducing the effects of that defense for juveniles. I first demonstrate that juveniles of the red-shouldered soapberry bug (Jadera haematoloma) are severely inhibited by the tough seed coat of their host plant, leading to high mortality early in development. Adults, in contrast, can create holes through which other individuals could potentially feed. I then manipulated whether or not seeds experienced adult feeding on two host plant species: a well-defended native host, balloon vine (Cardiospermum corindum) and a poorly defended introduced golden rain tree species (Koelreuteria elegans). I measured the effect of prior adult feeding on survival, development time, and final body size of soapberry bug juveniles. Survival in the first week of development was dramatically improved by prior adult feeding on both hosts. However, the benefits of prior adult feeding ceased after the first week of development and shifted to having a negative effect on performance. These results indicate that adults breaking through the seedcoat initially facilitate juveniles, but that this facilitation becomes competition as juveniles age.",

Here, we test the fundamental role of midbrain dopamine neurons in conferring predictive or motivational properties to cues, independent of external rewards. We demonstrate that phasic optogenetic excitation of dopamine neurons throughout the midbrain, when presented in temporal association with discrete sensory cues, is sufficient to instantiate those cues as conditioned stimuli that subsequently both evoke dopamine neuron activity on their own, and elicit cue-locked conditioned behaviors. Critically, we identify highly parcellated behavioral functions for dopamine neuron subpopulations projecting to discrete regions of striatum, revealing dissociable mesostriatal systems for the generation of incentive value and movement invigoration. These results show that dopamine neurons orchestrate Pavlovian conditioning via functionally heterogeneous, circuit-specific motivational signals to shape cue-controlled behavior.",

    "abstract": "While it is a well-established finding that subjects own names (SON) or familiar voices are salient during wakefulness, we here investigated processing of environmental stimuli during sleep including deep N3 and REM sleep. Besides the effects of sleep depth we investigated how sleep-specific EEG patterns (i.e. sleep spindles and slow oscillations [SOs]) relate to stimulus processing. Using 256-channel EEG we studied processing of auditory stimuli by means of event-related oscillatory responses (de-/ synchronisation, ERD/ERS) and potentials (ERPs) in N = 17 healthy sleepers. We varied stimulus salience by manipulating subjective (SON vs. unfamiliar name) and paralinguistic emotional relevance (familiar vs. unfamiliar voice, FV/UFV). Results reveal that evaluation of voice familiarity continues during all NREM sleep stages and even REM sleep suggesting a  sentinel processing mode of the human brain in the absence of wake-like consciousness. Especially UFV stimuli elicit larger responses in a 1-15 Hz range suggesting they continue being salient. Beyond this, we find that sleep spindles and the negative slope of SOs attenuate information processing. However, unlike previously suggested they do not uniformly inhibit information processing, but inhibition seems to be scaled to stimulus salience.\\n\\nFundingCB is supported by the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e.V. and CB, MW and DPJH are supported by a grant from the Austrian Science Fund FWF (Y-777).

Some patients undergo transformation to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is frequently resistant to chemotherapy and is generally fatal. Targeted sequencing of DNA and RNA was applied to identify mutations and transcriptional changes that accompanied transformation in a cohort of 16 patients, including 14 with paired samples. In most cases we found mutations that were specific to the FL clone dominant at diagnosis, supporting the view that DLBCL does not develop directly from FL, but from an ancestral progenitor. We identified frequent mutations in TP53, cell cycle regulators (cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases) and the PI3K pathway, as well as recurrent somatic copy number variants (SCNVs) on chromosome 3, 7 and 17p associated with transformation. An integrated analysis of RNA and DNA identified allele specific expression changes in oncogenes, including MYC, that could be attributed to structural rearrangements. By focusing on serial samples taken from two patients, we identified evidence of convergent tumour evolution, where clonal expansion was repeatedly associated with mutations targeting the same genes or pathways. Analysis of serial samples is a powerful way to identify core dependencies that support lymphoma growth.",

    "abstract": "As the primary microtubule-organizing center, centrosomes play a key role in establishing mitotic bipolar spindles that secure correct transmission of genomic content. For the fidelity of cell division, centrosome number must be strictly controlled by duplicating only once per cell cycle. Proper levels of centrosome proteins are shown to be critical for normal centrosome number and function. Overexpressing core centrosome factors leads to extra centrosomes, while depleting these factors results in centrosome duplication failure. In this regard, protein turnover by the ubiquitin-proteasome system provides a vital mechanism for the regulation of centrosome protein levels. Here, we report that FZR-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of Cdh1/Hct1/Fzr, a co-activator of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C), an E3 ubiquitin ligase, functions as a negative regulator of centrosome duplication in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo. During mitotic cell division in the early embryo, FZR-1 is associated with centrosomes and enriched at nuclei. Loss of fzr-1 function restores centrosome duplication and embryonic viability to the hypomorphic zyg-1(it25) mutant, in part, through elevated levels of SAS-5 at centrosomes. Our data suggest that the APC/CFZR-1 regulates SAS-5 levels by directly recognizing the conserved KEN-box motif, contributing to proper centrosome duplication. Together, our work shows that FZR-1 plays a conserved role in regulating centrosome duplication in Caenorhabditis elegans.",

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing technology enabled the sequencing of whole T-cell receptors (TCRs) and B-cell receptors (BCRs)/immunoglobulins (Igs) in the tumor microenvironment. Since BCRs/Igs in tumor tissues have high affinities for tumor-specific antigens, the patterns of their amino acid sequences and other sequence-independent features such as the number of somatic hypermutations (SHMs) may differ between the normal and tumor microenvironments. However, given the high diversity of BCRs/Igs and the rarity of recurrent sequences among individuals, it is far more difficult to capture such differences in BCR/Ig sequences than in TCR sequences. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility of discriminating BCRs/Igs in tumor and in normal tissues, by capturing these differences using supervised machine learning methods applied to RNA sequences of BCRs/Igs.\\n\\nRNA sequences of BCRs/Igs were obtained from matched normal and tumor specimens from 90 gastric cancer patients. BCR/Ig-features obtained in Rep-Seq were used to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. Different machine learning models using various features were constructed as well as gradient boosting machine (GBM) classifier combining these models. The results demonstrated that BCR/Ig sequences between normal and tumor microenvironments exhibit their differences. Next, by using a GBM trained to classify individual BCR/Ig sequences, we tried to classify sets of BCR/Ig sequences into normal or tumor classes. As a result, an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.826 was achieved, suggesting that BCR/Ig repertoires have distinct sequence-level features in normal and tumor tissues.\\n\\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that BCR/Ig sequences derived from tumor and normal tissues have globally distinct patterns, and that these tissues can be effectively differentiated using BCR/Ig repertoires.",

Statistical analysis of cancer data from different tissues of origin highlights differences and similarities which can guide drug repositioning as well as the design of targeted and precise treatments. Here, we developed an improved Bayesian network model for tumour mutational profiles and applied it to 8,198 patient samples across 22 cancer types from TCGA. For each cancer type, we identified the interactions between mutated genes, capturing signatures beyond mere mutational frequencies. When comparing mutation networks, we found genes which interact both within and across cancer types. To detach cancer classification from the tissue type we performed de novo clustering of the pancancer mutational profiles based on the Bayesian network models. We found 22 novel clusters which significantly improved survival prediction beyond clinical and histopathological information. The models highlight key gene interactions for each cluster that can be used for genomic stratification in clinical trials and for identifying drug targets within strata.",

Observation of the genome at a single cell resolution is currently achieved by pre-amplification using whole genome amplification (WGA) techniques that differ by their biochemical aspects and as a result by biased amplification of the original molecule. Several comparisons between commercially available single cell dedicated WGA kits (scWGA) were performed, however, these comparisons are costly, were only performed on selected scWGA kit and more notably, are limited by the number of analyzed cells, making them limited for reproducibility analysis. We benchmarked an economical assay to compare all commercially available scWGA kits that is based on targeted sequencing of thousands of genomic regions, including highly mutable genomic regions (microsatellites), from a large cohort of human single cells (125 cells in total). Using this approach, we could analyze the genome coverage, the reproducibility of genome coverage and the error rate of each kit. Our experimental design provides an affordable and reliable comparative assay that simulates a real single cell experiment. Results demonstrate the needfor a dedicated kit selection depending on the desired single cell assay.",

GSDMD is activated by the proinflammatory caspase-1 and caspase-11 via proteolytic cleavage in the linker connecting its N-terminal and C-terminal domain (GSDMDNterm, Cterm). The released N-terminal domain is sufficient to form pores in the plasma membrane, resulting in swelling and subsequent rupture of the cell. Here, we report the crystal structure of the autoinhibitory C-terminal domain of GSDMD at 2.04 [A] resolution to further analyse determinants of GSDMD activation. GSDMDCterm adopts a compact helical fold unique to gasdermin proteins. Structural analysis and comparison to other gasdermin proteins reveals a conserved key interface for interactions between GSDMDNterm and GSDMDCterm. Variations in two additional surface patches involved in interdomain interactions in full-length gasdermins suggest a role of these regions in modulating activation pathways, in agreement with biochemical characterization of different gasdermins.",

ChAs were generated against serogroup B Neisseria meningitidis (MenB), the predominant cause of meningococcal disease in the Western hemisphere. MenB ChAs exploit the lipoprotein factor H binding protein (fHbp) as a molecular scaffold to display the immunogenic VR2 epitope from the integral membrane protein PorA.

In mice, ChAs elicit antibodies directed against fHbp and PorA, with antibody responses correlating to protection against meningococcal disease.

Our results, supported by computational models, suggest that somatostatin interneurons (SST-INs) increase pyramidal neuron reliability by suppressing parvalbumin interneurons (PV-INs) via the inhibitory SST[-&gt;]PV circuit. Using a novel movie classification task, we further show that, by reducing variability, activating SST-INs can improve the ability of mice to discriminate between ambiguous stimuli.

While several yeast metabolites activate known gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in Drosophila melanogaster, the chemosensory channels mediating yeast feeding remain unknown. Here we identify a class of proboscis GRNs required for yeast intake, and show that these GRNs act redundantly to mediate yeast feeding. While nutritional and reproductive states synergistically increase yeast appetite, we find a separation of these state signals at the level of GRN responses to yeast: amino acid but not mating state enhances yeast GRN gain. The sensitivity of sweet GRNs to sugar is not increased by protein deprivation, providing a potential basis for protein-specific appetite. The emerging picture is that different internal states act at distinct levels of a dedicated gustatory circuit to elicit nutrient-specific appetites towards a complex, ecologically relevant protein source.",

Here, we show that IQGAP1 is induced in the liver upon fasting and can also regulate {beta}-oxidation and ketone body synthesis. Utilizing ketogenic diet and pharmacologic activation we identified that hepatic PPAR activity is compromised in Iqgap1-/-mice. Our data show that IQGAP1 interacts with the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) and IQGAP1 deletion results in enhanced mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activation. Conversely, ectopic expression of IQGAP1 in Iqgap1-/- mice was sufficient to suppress mTORC1 signaling. We also confirmed that modulation of mTORC1 signaling by IQGAP1 is cell autonomous. This increased mTORC1 activation impedes PPAR signaling since mTORC1 inhibition restored a subset of metabolic genes in Iqgap1-/- mice. Overall, we demonstrate a previously unidentified role for IQGAP1 as an important regulator of mTORC1 activity and long-term ketosis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn metabolic network reconstruction the stoichiometric balancing of reactions is essential to create realistic constraint-based models. At the genome scale, balancing is a repetitive task that consumes valuable curator resource that could be deployed elsewhere. Automatic reaction balancing is possible and could be useful across computational systems biology, but widespread use of the appropriate code has been limited by the diversity of non-interoperable programming languages used in the field. RESTful web services offer a language-agnostic way of binding services together.\\n\\nResultsReaction balancing can be posed as a mixed integer linear programming problem to identify stoichiometric coefficients and infer commonly missing components. This functionality has been exposed as a web service that consumes a list of reactions as JSON or SBML. The reaction balancing web service has been deployed at http://www.nactem.ac.uk/balancer. Code is available via Github. By way of demonstration the service has been applied to a Chinese hamster ovary cell metabolic reconstruction to bring a further 219 reactions into balance.\\n\\nConclusionsThe majority of systems biology software cannot access existing automatic reaction balancing tools due to a lack of language-specific bindings. Web services bridge different languages by using widely-spoken web communication protocols, meaning that one binding works for almost all languages. Automatic reaction balancing can now be consumed by any systems biology software via a RESTful web service.",

Despite large differences in gene size and architecture, we find that yeast and human genes share a unique, antisense transcription-associated chromatin signature. We asked whether this signature is related to a biological function for antisense transcription. Using quantitative RNA-FISH, we observed changes in sense transcript distributions in nuclei and cytoplasm as antisense transcript levels were altered. To determine the mechanistic differences underlying these distributions, we developed a mathematical framework describing transcription from initiation to transcript degradation. At GAL1, high levels of antisense transcription alters sense transcription dynamics, reducing rates of transcript production and processing, while increasing transcript stability, which is also a genome-wide association. Establishing the antisense transcription-associated chromatin signature through disruption of the Set3C histone deacetylase activity is sufficient to similarly change these rates even in the absence of antisense transcription.

Within the heterogenous array of TB granulomas, some contain triglyceride (TG) rich foamy macrophages, the etiology and function of which remains largely unexplained.

We elucidate a role for the RD1 region of mycobacterial genome to be a key player in this phenomenon. TG storage in necrosis associated foamy macrophages promoted the pro-inflammatory state of macrophages while silencing expression of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase (DGAT1) suppressed expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Surprisingly, acute infection with Mtb led to lipolysis of host TG, rather than synthesis, suggesting mobilization of triglyceride stored within macrophage lipid droplets to be involved in the inflammatory response to infection. Our data is likely to open new avenues for management of the inflammatory response during infection.",

The method aims to identify the essential functional connections to ensure optimal information flow via the objective criterion of global efficiency minus the cost of surviving connections. The OMST technique was applied to multichannel, resting-state neuromagnetic recordings from four groups of participants: healthy adults (n=50), adults who have suffered mild traumatic brain injury (n=30), typically developing children (n=27), and reading-disabled children (n=25). Weighted interactions between network nodes (sensors) were computed using an integrated approach of dominant intrinsic coupling modes based on two alternative metrics (symbolic mutual information and phase lag index), resulting in excellent discrimination of individual cases according to their group membership. Classification results using OMST-derived functional networks were clearly superior to results using either relative power spectrum features or functional networks derived through the conventional minimal spanning trees algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Biparental care for offspring requires cooperation, but it is also a potential source of conflict, since one parent may care less at the expense of the other. How, then, do parents respond to the reduction of their partners care? Theoretical models predict that parents that feed offspring should partially compensate for the reduced care of their partner. However, for incubating birds partial compensation is unlikely the optimal strategy, because the entire brood can fail with reduced care. Although biparental incubation dominates in non-passerine birds, short-term manipulations of parental care and evaluations of individual differences in the response, both crucial to our understanding of parental cooperation, are scarce. Here, we describe the response of semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) parents to a 24-hour removal of their partner during the incubation period, explore factors that can explain individual variation in the response, and describe how incubation rhythms changed after the removed parent returned. On average, the parents compensated partially for the absence of their partners care (59%; 95%CI: 49-70%, N = 25 individuals). The level of compensation did not differ between the sexes. However, individual responses varied from no to full compensation (2-101%). In seven nests where the removed parent never returned, the widowed parent attended the nest for 0-10 days (median: 4 days). In contrast to patterns observed in undisturbed nests or in uniparental species, nest attendance during compensation tended to be higher during the warmer part of the day. Although the level of compensation was not related to the before-experimental share of incubation, more responsive parents (that left the nest earlier upon human approach) compensated more. The quality of incubation in the after-experimental period was lower than usual, but improved quickly over time. Our findings suggest that full compensation might be limited by energetic constraints or by variation in responsiveness to the absence of the partner. Nevertheless, semipalmated sandpiper parents are able to adjust their subsequent incubation behaviour to take full responsibility for the nest when widowed. Because (nearly) full compensation was the most common response, we speculate that all individuals attempt full compensation, but that some fail because their energy stores get depleted, or because they are less responsive to the absence of their partner.",

    "abstract": "Biparental care for offspring requires cooperation, but it is also a potential source of conflict, since one parent may care less at the expense of the other. How, then, do parents respond to the reduction of their partners care? Theoretical models predict that parents that feed offspring should partially compensate for the reduced care of their partner. However, for incubating birds partial compensation is unlikely the optimal strategy, because the entire brood can fail with reduced care. Although biparental incubation dominates in non-passerine birds, short-term manipulations of parental care and evaluations of individual differences in the response, both crucial to our understanding of parental cooperation, are scarce. Here, we describe the response of semipalmated sandpiper (Calidris pusilla) parents to a 24-hour removal of their partner during the incubation period, explore factors that can explain individual variation in the response, and describe how incubation rhythms changed after the removed parent returned. On average, the parents compensated partially for the absence of their partners care (59%; 95%CI: 49-70%, N = 25 individuals). The level of compensation did not differ between the sexes. However, individual responses varied from no to full compensation (2-101%). In seven nests where the removed parent never returned, the widowed parent attended the nest for 0-10 days (median: 4 days). In contrast to patterns observed in undisturbed nests or in uniparental species, nest attendance during compensation tended to be higher during the warmer part of the day. Although the level of compensation was not related to the before-experimental share of incubation, more responsive parents (that left the nest earlier upon human approach) compensated more.

    "abstract": "In order for cells to sense and thus respond to their environment, they require transmembrane receptors, which bind extracellular ligands and then transduce this signal within the cell. A subset of receptors, with single-pass transmembrane domains are known as cytokine receptors and act via the Janus Kinase and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. These receptors are essential for processes such as haematopoiesis, immune responses and tissue homeostasis. In order to transduce ligand activation, cytokine receptors must dimerise. However, mechanisms regulating their dimerisation are largely unknown. In order to better understand the processes regulating cytokine receptor levels, activity and dimerisation, we used the highly conserved JAK/STAT pathway in Drosophila, which acts via a single receptor, known as Domeless. We have performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila cells, identifying MASK as a positive regulator of Domeless dimerisation and protein levels. We show that MASK is able to regulate JAK/STAT signalling both in vitro and in vivo. We go on to show that MASK is able to bind to Domeless via its Ankyrin repeat domains and alters the stability of the receptor. Finally, we extend our observations to the human homologue, ANKHD1, and demonstrate functional conservation, with ANKHD1 able to regulate JAK/STAT signalling and the levels of a subset of pathway receptors in human cells. Taken together, we have identified MASK as a conserved regulator of cytokine receptor levels, which may have implications for human health.",

    "abstract": "The coexistence of multicopy plasmids is a common phenomenon. However, the evolutionary forces promoting these genotypes are poorly understood. In this study, we have analyzed multiple ColE1 plasmids (pB1000, pB1005 and pB1006) coexisting within Haemophilus influenzae RdKW20 in all possible combinations. When transformed into the naive host, each plasmid type presented a particular copy number and produced a specific resistance profile and biological cost, whether alone or coexisting with the other plasmids. Therefore, there was no fitness advantage associated with plasmid coexistence that could explain these common plasmid associations in nature. Using experimental evolution, we showed how H. influenzae Rd was able to completely compensate the fitness cost produced by any of these plasmids. Crucially, once the bacterium has compensated for a first plasmid, the acquisition of new multicopy plasmid(s) did not produced any extra biological cost. We argue therefore that compensatory adaptation pave the way for the acquisition of multiple coexisting ColE1 plasmids.\\n\\nImportanceAntibiotic resistance is a major concern for human and animal health. Plasmids play a major role in the acquisition and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance genes. In this report we investigate, for the first time, how plasmids are capable to cohabit stably in populations. This coexistence of plasmids is driven by compensatory evolution alleviating the cost of a first plasmid, which potentiates the acquisition of further plasmids at no extra cost. This phenomenon explains the high prevalence of plasmids coexistance in wild type bacteria, which generates multiresistant clones and contributes to the maintenance and spread of antibiotic resistance genes within bacterial populations.",

The fact that UHMK1 regulates these factors suggests that UHMK1 might be involved in RNA processing and perhaps leukemogenesis. Here we analyzed UHMK1 expression in normal hematopoietic and leukemic cells as well as its function in leukemia cell line.\\n\\nIn the normal hematopoietic compartment, markedly higher levels of transcripts were observed in differentiated lymphocytes (CD4+, CD8+ and CD19+) compared to the progenitor enriched subpopulation (CD34+) or leukemia cell lines. UHMK1 expression was upregulated in megakaryocytic-, monocytic-and granulocytic-induced differentiation of established leukemia cell lines and in erythrocytic-induced differentiation of CD34+ cells. No aberrant expression was observed in patient samples of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid (AML) or lymphoblastic (ALL) leukemia. Nonetheless, in MDS patients, increased levels of UHMK1 expression positively impacted event free and overall survival.\\n\\nLentivirus mediated UHMK1 knockdown did not affect proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis or migration of U937 leukemia cells, although UHMK1 silencing strikingly increased clonogenicity of these cells.

Paupar, a CNS expressed lncRNA, controls neuroblastoma cell growth by binding and modulating the activity of genome-wide transcriptional regulatory elements. We show here that Paupar transcript directly binds KAP1, an essential epigenetic regulatory protein, and thereby regulates the expression of shared target genes important for proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Paupar promotes KAP1 chromatin occupancy and H3K9me3 deposition at a subset of distal targets, through formation of a DNA binding ribonucleoprotein complex containing Paupar, KAP1 and the PAX6 transcription factor. Paupar-KAP1 genome-wide co-occupancy reveals a 4-fold enrichment of overlap between Paupar and KAP1 bound sequences. Furthermore, both Paupar and Kap1 loss of function in vivo accelerates lineage progression in the mouse postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ) stem cell niche and disrupts olfactory bulb neurogenesis. These observations provide important conceptual insights into the trans-acting modes of lncRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation, the mechanisms of KAP1 genomic recruitment and identify Paupar and Kap1 as regulators of SVZ neurogenesis.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionGlioblastoma exhibits profound tumor heterogeneity, which causes inconsistent treatment response. The aim of this study was to propose an interpretation method of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using joint histogram analysis of DTI-p and-q. With this method we explored the patterns of tumor infiltration which causes disruption of brain microstructure, and examined the prognostic value of tumor infiltrative patterns for patient survival.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsA total of 115 primary glioblastoma patients (mean age 59.3 years, 87 males) were prospectively recruited from July 2010 to August 2015. Patients underwent preoperative MRI scans and maximal safe resection. DTI was processed and decomposed into p and q components. The univariate and joint histograms of DTI-p and-q were constructed using the voxels of contrast-enhancing and non-enhancing regions respectively. Eight joint histogram features were obtained and correlated with tumor progression and patient survival. Their prognostic values were compared with clinical factors using receiver operating characteristic curves.\\n\\nResultsThe subregion of increased DTI-p and decreased DTI-q accounted for the largest proportion. Additional diffusion patterns can be identified via joint histogram analysis. Particularly, higher proportion of decreased DTI-p and increased DTI-q in non-enhancing region contributed to worse progression-free survival (hazard ratio = 1.08, p< 0.001) and overall survival (hazard ratio = 1.11, p < 0.001).\\n\\nConclusionsJoint histogram analysis of DTI can provide a comprehensive measure of tumor infiltration and microstructure change, which showed prognostic values. The subregion of decreased DTI-p and increased DTI-q in non-enhancing regions may indicate a more invasive habitat.",
