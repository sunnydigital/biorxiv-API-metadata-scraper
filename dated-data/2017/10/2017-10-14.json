    "abstract": "Most people tend to bisect horizontal lines slightly to the left of their true center (pseudoneglect), and start visual search from left-sided items. This physiological leftward spatial bias may depend on hemispheric asymmetries in the organization of attentional networks, but the precise mechanisms are unknown. Here we modeled relevant aspects of the ventral and dorsal attentional networks (VAN and DAN) of the human brain. First, we demonstrated pseudoneglect in visual search in 101 right-handed psychology students. Participants consistently tended to start the task from a left-sided item, thus showing pseudoneglect. Second, we trained populations of simulated neurorobots to perform a similar task, by using a genetic algorithm. The neurorobots behavior was controlled by artificial neural networks, which simulated the human VAN and DAN in the two brain hemispheres. Neurorobots differed in the connectional constraints that were applied to the anatomy and function of the attention networks. Results indicated that (1) neurorobots provided with a biologically plausible hemispheric asymmetry of the VAN-DAN connections, as well as with inter-hemispheric inhibition, displayed the best match with human data; however, (2) anatomical asymmetry per se was not sufficient to generate pseudoneglect; in addition, the VAN must have an excitatory influence on the ipsilateral DAN; (3) neurorobots provided with bilateral competence in the VAN but without inter-hemispheric inhibition failed to display pseudoneglect. These findings provide a proof of concept of the causal link between connectional asymmetries and pseudoneglect, and specify important biological constraints that result in physiological asymmetries of human behavior.\\n\\nSignificance statementMost of us start our exploration of the environment from the left side. Here we demonstrated this tendency in undergraduate students, and trained artificial agents (neurorobots) to perform a similar visual search task. The neurorobots behavior was controlled by artificial neural networks, inspired by the human fronto-parietal attentional system. In seven distinct populations of neurorobots, different constraints were applied on the network connections within and between the brain hemispheres. Only one of the artificial populations behaved in a similar way to the human participants. The connectional constraints applied to this population included known characteristics of the human fronto-parietal networks, but had also additional properties not previously described. Thus, our findings specify biological constraints that induce physiological asymmetries of human behavior.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the relationship between proliferation and tissue topology in an epithelial tissue undergoing elongation. We found that cell division is not required for elongation of the early Drosophila follicular epithelium, but does drive the tissue towards optimal geometric packing. To increase tissue regularity, cell divisions are oriented in the planar axis, along the direction of tissue expansion. Planar division orientation is governed by apico-cortical tension, which aligns with tissue expansion but not with interphase cell shape elongation. Hertwigs Rule, which holds that cell elongation determines division orientation, is therefore broken in this tissue. We tested whether this observation could be explained by anisotropic activity of the conserved Pins/Mud spindle-orienting machinery, which controls division orientation in the apical-basal axis. We found that Pins/Mud does not participate in planar division orientation. Rather, tension translates into planar division orientation in a manner dependent on Canoe/Afadin, which links actomyosin to adherens junctions. These findings demonstrate that division orientation in different axes - apical-basal and planar - is controlled by distinct, independent mechanisms in a proliferating epithelium.\\n\\nSummary StatementRegularity in a proliferating epithelium requires cells to divorce division orientation from interphase shape, which they accomplish by using distinct mechanisms to orient divisions in the apical-basal and planar axes.",

Recently, novel in vivo methods and technologies utilizing genome editing enabled important insights into the cell lineages of animals2-8. In contrast, human cell lineage remains restricted to retrospective approaches, which still lack in resolution and cost-efficient solutions. Here we demonstrate a scalable platform for human cell lineage tracing based on Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) targeted by duplex Molecular Inversion Probes (MIPs). With this platform we accurately reproduced a known lineage of DU145 cell lines cells9 and reconstructed lineages of healthy and metastatic single cells from a melanoma patient. The reconstructed trees matched the anatomical and SNV references while adding further refinements. Our platform allowed to faithfully recapitulate lineages of developmental tissue formation in cells from healthy donors. In summary, our lineage discovery platform can profile informative STR somatic mutations efficiently and we provide a solid, high-resolution lineage reconstruction even in challenging low-mutation-rate healthy single cells.",

    "abstract": "Methylation at the N6 position of adenosine (m6A) is a highly prevalent and reversible modification within eukaryotic mRNAs that has been linked to many stages of RNA processing and fate. Recent studies suggest that m6A deposition and proteins involved in the m6A pathway play a diverse set of roles in either restricting or modulating the lifecycles of select viruses. Here, we report that m6A levels are significantly increased in cells infected with the oncogenic human DNA virus Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Transcriptome-wide m6A-sequencing of the KSHV-positive renal carcinoma cell line iSLK.219 during lytic reactivation revealed the presence of m6A across multiple kinetic classes of viral transcripts, and a concomitant decrease in m6A levels across much of the host transcriptome. However, we found that depletion of the m6A machinery had differential pro- and anti-viral impacts on viral gene expression depending on the cell-type analyzed. In iSLK.219 and iSLK.BAC16 cells the pathway functioned in a pro-viral manner, as depletion of the m6A writer METTL3 and the reader YTHDF2 significantly impaired virion production. In iSLK.219 cells the defect was linked to their roles in the post-transcriptional accumulation of the major viral lytic transactivator ORF50, which is m6A modified. In contrast, although the ORF50 mRNA was also m6A modified in KSHV infected B cells, ORF50 protein expression was instead increased upon depletion of METTL3, or, to a lesser extent, YTHDF2. These results highlight that the m6A pathway is centrally involved in regulating KSHV gene expression, and underscore how the outcome of this dynamically regulated modification can vary significantly between cell types.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryIn addition to its roles in regulating cellular RNA fate, methylation at the N6 position of adenosine (m6A) of mRNA has recently emerged as a mechanism for regulating viral infection. While it has been known for over 40 years that the mRNA of nuclear replicating DNA viruses contain m6A, only recently have studies began to examine the distribution of this modification across viral transcripts, as well as characterize its functional impact upon viral lifecycles. Here, we apply m6A-sequencing to map the location of m6A modifications throughout the transcriptome of the oncogenic human DNA virus Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). We show that the m6A machinery functions in a cell type specific manner to either promote or inhibit KSHV gene expression. Thus, the KSHV lifecycle is impacted by the m6A pathway, but the functional outcome may depend on cell lineage specific differences in m6A-based regulation.",

These included PARP1 mutations outside of the DNA interacting regions of the protein, such as mutations in solvent exposed regions of the catalytic domain and clusters of mutations around points of contact between ZnF, WGR and HD domains. These mutations altered PARP1 trapping, as did a mutation found in a clinical case of PARPi resistance. These genetic studies reinforce the importance of trapped PARP1 as a key cytotoxic DNA lesion and suggest that interactions between non-DNA binding domains of PARP1 influence cytotoxicity. Finally, different mechanisms of PARPi resistance (BRCA1 reversion, PARP1, 53BP1, REV7 mutation) had differing effects on chemotherapy sensitivity, suggesting that the underlying mechanism of PARPi resistance likely influences the success of subsequent therapies.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition of cellular identity is coupled to changes in the nuclear periphery and nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Whether and how these changes determine cell fate remains unclear. We have uncovered a mechanism regulating NPC acetylation to direct cell fate after asymmetric division in budding yeast. The lysine deacetylase Hos3 associates specifically with daughter cell NPCs during mitosis to delay cell cycle entry (Start). Hos3-dependent deacetylation of nuclear basket and central channel nucleoporins establishes daughter cell-specific nuclear accumulation of the transcriptional repressor Whi5 during anaphase and perinuclear silencing of the CLN2 gene in the following G1 phase. Hos3-dependent coordination of both events restrains Start in daughter but not in mother cells. We propose that deacetylation modulates transport-dependent and - independent functions of NPCs, leading to differential cell cycle progression in mother and daughter cells. Similar mechanisms might regulate NPC functions in specific cell types and/or cell cycle stages in multicellular organisms.",

We replicate numerous recent findings, such as a genetic association between Alzheimers disease and lipid levels, while the depth of phenotyping in the NFBC1966 highlights a range of novel significant genetic associations between traits.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study illustrates the power in taking a hypothesis-free approach to the study of shared genetic aetiology between human traits and diseases. It also demonstrates the potential of the PRS method to provide important biological insights using only a single well-phenotyped epidemiological study of moderate sample size (~5k), with important advantages over evaluating genetic correlations from GWAS summary statistics only.",

    "abstract": "Converging evidence indicates that separate goal-directed and habitual systems compete to control behavior1. However, it has proven difficult to reliably induce habitual behavior in human participants2-4. We reasoned that habits may be present in the form of habitually prepared responses, but are overridden by goal-directed processes, preventing their overt expression. Here we show that latent habits can be unmasked by limiting the time participants have to respond to a stimulus. Participants trained for 4 days on a visuomotor association task. By continuously varying the time allowed to prepare responses, we found that the probability of expressing a learned habit followed a stereotyped time course, peaking 300-600ms after stimulus presentation. This time course was captured by a computational model of response preparation in which habitual responses are automatically prepared at short latency, but are replaced by goal-directed responses at longer latency. A more extensive period of practice (20 days) led to increased habit expression by reducing the average time of movement initiation. These findings refine our understanding of habits, and show that practice can influence habitual behavior in distinct ways: by promoting habit formation, and by modulating the likelihood of habit expression.",

Such \\\"urgency\\\" signal components, defined by their independence from sensory evidence, are observed even before evidence is presented and can grow dynamically during decision formation. Is urgency applied globally, or are there adjustments of a distinct nature applied at different processing levels? Using a novel multi-level recording paradigm, we show that dynamic urgency impacting cortical action-preparation signals is echoed downstream in electromyographic indices of muscle activation, but does not directly influence upstream cortical levels. A motor-independent representation of cumulative evidence reached lower pre-response levels under conditions of greater motor-level urgency, paralleling a decline in choice accuracy. At the sensory level itself, we find a boost in differential evidence, which is correlated with changes in pupil size and acts to alleviate, rather than contribute to, the overall accuracy cost under speed pressure.",

    "abstract": "There is substantial interest in uncovering the genetic basis of the traits underlying adaptive responses in tree species, as this information will ultimately aid conservation and industrial endeavors across populations, generations, and environments. Fundamentally, the characterization of such genetic bases is within the context of a genetic architecture, which describes the mutlidimensional relationship between genotype and phenotype through the identification of causative variants, their relative location within a genome, expression, pleiotropic effect, environmental influence, and degree of dominance, epistasis, and additivity. Here, we review theory related to polygenic local adaptation and contextualize these expectations with methods often used to uncover the genetic basis of traits important to tree conservation and industry. A broad literature survey suggests that most tree traits generally exhibit considerable heritability, that underlying quantitative genetic variation (QST) is structured more so across populations than neutral expectations (FST) in 69% of comparisons across the literature, and that single-locus associations often exhibit small estimated per-locus effects. Together, these results suggest differential selection across populations often acts on tree phenotypes underlain by polygenic architectures consisting of numerous small to moderate effect loci. Using this synthesis, we highlight the limits of using solely single-locus approaches to describe underlying genetic architectures and close by addressing hurdles and promising alternatives towards such goals, remark upon the current state of tree genomics, and identify future directions for this field. Importantly, we argue, the success of future endeavors should not be predicated on the shortcomings of past studies and will instead be dependent upon the application of theory to empiricism, standardized reporting, centralized open-access databases, and continual input and review of the communitys research.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis is an essential metabolic process of a growing cell. Cells need to continuously synthesize new ribosomes in order to make new proteins than can support building biomass and cell division. It is obvious that in the absence of ribosome biogenesis, cell growth will stop and cell division will stall. However, it is not clear whether cell growth stops due to reduced protein synthesis capacity (translational stress) or due to activation of signaling specific to ribosome biogenesis abnormalities (ribosomal stress). To understand the signaling pathways leading to cell cycle arrest under ribosomal and translational stress conditions, we performed time series RNA-seq experiments of cells at different time of ribosomal and translational stress. We found that expression of ribosomal protein genes follow different course over the time of these two stress types. In addition, ribosomal stress is sensed early in the cell, as early as 2hr. Up-regulation of genes responsive to oxidative stress and over representation of mRNAs for transcription factors responsive to stress was detected in cell at 2hr of ribosomal protein depletion. Even though, we detected phenotypic similarities in terms of cell separation and accumulation in G1 phase cells during inhibition of ribosome formation and ribosome function, different gene expression patterns underlie these phenotypes, indicating a difference in causalities of these phenotypes. Both ribosomal and translational stress show common increased expression of stress responsive gene expression, like Crz1 target gene expression, signature of oxidative stress response and finally membrane or cell wall instability. We speculate that cell membrane and cell wall acts as major stress sensor in the cell and adjust cellular metabolism accordingly. Any change in membrane lipid composition, or membrane protein oxidation, or decrease or increase in intracellular turgor pressure causes stress in cell membrane. Cell membrane or cell wall stress activates and/or inactivates specific signaling pathway which triggers stress responsive gene expression and adaptation of cellular behavior accordingly.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A viruses (IAV) initiate infection via binding of the viral hemagglutinin (HA) to sialylated glycan receptors on host cells. HAs receptor specificity towards sialic acid (SA) is well studied and clearly critical for virus infection, but the contribution of the highly complex cellular plasma membrane to the cellular specificity remains elusive. In addition, some studies indicated that other host cell factors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor might contribute to the initial virus-cell contact and further downstream signaling1.\\n\\nHere we use two complementary methods, glycan arrays and single-virus force spectroscopy (SVFS) to compare influenza virus receptor specificity with actual host cell binding. Unexpectedly, our study reveals that HAs receptor binding preference does not necessarily reflect virus-cell specificity. We propose SVFS as a tool to elucidate the cell binding preference of IAV thereby including the complex environment of sialylated receptors within the plasma membrane of living cells.",

    "abstract": "Domestic dogs are highly social, and have been shown sensitive not only to the actions of humans and other dogs but to the interactions between them. To examine the canine neurobiological response to observed interactions between a human and another dog, we collected fMRI data from dogs while they watched their owner feed a realistic fake dog or deposit food in a bucket. Given the likelyihood that arousal and affective state may contribute to responses to observed social situations, we examined the relationship between amygdala activation in these two conditions and an independent measure of aggressive temperament from the C-BARQ scale. Dogs rated more aggressive showed significantly higher activation in the fake-dog versus bucket condition. This finding suggests a neurobiological mechanism mediated by the amygdala for dog-directed aggression, especially when their owner interacts with another dog. Such a mechanism may have some parallels to human jealousy. Further, it adds to a growing body of evidence that specific neurobiological responses correlate with canine temperament and can be a predictor of future behavior. We also found evidence that the amygdala response habituates with repeated observed interactions. This suggests value in exposure-based interventions for potentially aggressive dogs.",
