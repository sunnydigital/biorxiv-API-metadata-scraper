    "abstract": "Recent advances have allowed for greater investigation into microbial regulation of mercury toxicity in the environment. In wetlands in particular, dissolved organic matter (DOM) may influence methylmercury (MeHg) production both through chemical interactions and through substrate effects on microbiomes. We conducted microcosm experiments in two disparate wetland environments (oligotrophic unvegetated and high-C vegetated sediments) to examine the impacts of plant leachate and inorganic mercury loadings (20 mg/L HgCl2) on microbiomes, DOM cycling, and MeHg production in the St. Louis River Estuary. Our research reveals the greater relative capacity for mercury methylation in vegetated over unvegetated sediments. Further, our work shows how mercury cycling in oligotrophic unvegetated sediments may be susceptible to DOM inputs in the St. Louis River Estuary: microcosms receiving leachate produced substantially more MeHg than unamended microcosms. We also demonstrate (1) changes in microbiome structure towards Clostridia, (2) metagenomic shifts toward fermentation, and (3) degradation of complex DOM; all of which coincide with elevated net MeHg production in unvegetated microcosms receiving leachate. Finally, we examine microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as known potential methylators and identify important organisms for future research in the Great Lakes region. Together, our work shows the influence of wetland vegetation in controlling MeHg production in the Great Lakes region and provides evidence that this may be due to both enhanced microbial activity as well as differences in microbiome composition.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording using multi-electrode arrays can provide a valuable technique for studying circuit connectivity and engineering neural interfaces. However, interpreting these measurements is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is greatly complicated by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which can exhibit complex and nonlinear waveforms, and overlap temporarily with evoked spikes. Here we develop a scalable algorithm based on a structured Gaussian Process model to estimate the artifact and identify evoked spikes. The effectiveness of our methods is demonstrated in both real and simulated 512-electrode recordings in the peripheral primate retina with single-electrode and several types of multi-electrode stimulation. We establish small error rates in the identification of evoked spikes, with a computational complexity that is compatible with real-time data analysis. This technology may be helpful in the design of future high-resolution sensory prostheses based on tailored stimulation (e.g., retinal prostheses), and for closed-loop neural stimulation at a much larger scale than currently possible.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySimultaneous electrical stimulation and recording using multi-electrode arrays can provide a valuable technique for studying circuit connectivity and engineering neural interfaces. However, interpreting these recordings is challenging because the spike sorting process (identifying and segregating action potentials arising from different neurons) is largely stymied by electrical stimulation artifacts across the array, which are typically larger than the signals of interest. We develop a novel computational framework to estimate and subtract away this contaminating artifact, enabling the large-scale analysis of responses of possibly hundreds of cells to tailored stimulation. Importantly, we suggest that this technology may also be helpful for the development of future high-resolution neural prosthetic devices (e.g., retinal prostheses).",

    "abstract": "Recent experiments and simulations have demonstrated that proteins can fold on the ribosome. However, the extent and generality of fitness effects resulting from co-translational folding remain open questions. Here we report a genome-wide analysis that uncovers evidence of evolutionary selection for co-translational folding. We describe a robust statistical approach to identify loci within genes that are both significantly enriched in slowly translated codons and evolutionarily conserved. Surprisingly, we find that domain boundaries can explain only a small fraction of these conserved loci. Instead, we propose that regions enriched in slowly translated codons are associated with co-translational folding intermediates, which may be smaller than a single domain. We show that the intermediates predicted by a native-centric model of co-translational folding account for the majority of these loci across more than 500 E. coli proteins. By making a direct connection to protein folding, this analysis provides strong evidence that many synonymous substitutions have been selected to optimize translation rates at specific locations within genes. More generally, our results indicate that kinetics, and not just thermodynamics, can significantly alter the efficiency of self-assembly in a biological context.",

Reconstructing large-scale genome-wide networks which capture the influence of TFs on target genes are essential for understanding and accurate modelling of living cells. We propose RGBM: a gene regulatory network (GRN) inference algorithm, which can handle data from heterogeneous information sources including dynamic time-series, gene knockout, gene knockdown, DNA microarrays and RNA-Seq expression profiles. RGBM allows to use an a priori mechanistic of active biding network consisting of TFs and corresponding target genes. RGBM is evaluated on the DREAM challenge datasets where it surpasses the winners of the competitions and other established methods for two evaluation metrics by about 10-15%.\\n\\nWe use RGBM to identify the main regulators of the molecular subtypes of brain tumors. Our analysis reveals the identity and corresponding biological activities of the master regulators driving transformation of the G-CIMP-high into the G-CIMP-low subtype of glioma and PA-like into LGm6-GBM, thus, providing a clue to the yet undetermined nature of the transcriptional events driving the evolution among these novel glioma subtypes.\\n\\nRGBM is available for download on CRAN at https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/RGBM/index.html",

    "abstract": "Tumor molecular profiling plays an integral role in identifying genomic anomalies which may help in personalizing cancer treatments, improving patient outcomes and minimizing risks associated with different therapies. However, critical information regarding the evidence of clinical utility of such anomalies is largely buried in biomedical literature. It is becoming prohibitive for biocurators, clinical researchers and oncologists to keep up with the rapidly growing volume and breadth of information, especially those that describe therapeutic implications of biomarkers and therefore relevant for treatment selection. In an effort to improve and speed up the process of manually reviewing and extracting relevant information from literature, we have developed a natural language processing (NLP)-based text mining (TM) system called eGARD (extracting Genomic Anomalies association with Response to Drugs). This system relies on the syntactic nature of sentences coupled with various textual features to extract relations between genomic anomalies and drug response from MEDLINE abstracts. Our system achieved high precision, recall and F-measure of up to 0.95, 0.86 and 0.90, respectively, on annotated evaluation datasets created in-house and obtained externally from PharmGKB. Additionally, the system extracted information that helps determine the confidence level of extraction to support prioritization of curation. Such a system will enable clinical researchers to explore the use of published markers to stratify patients upfront for  best-fit therapies and readily generate hypotheses for new clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous fungi produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites (SMs) critical for defense, virulence, and communication. The metabolic pathways that produce SMs are found in contiguous gene clusters in fungal genomes, an atypical arrangement for metabolic pathways in other eukaryotes. Comparative studies of filamentous fungal species have shown that SM gene clusters are often either highly divergent or uniquely present in one or a handful of species, hampering efforts to determine the genetic basis and evolutionary drivers of SM gene cluster divergence. Here we examined SM variation in 66 cosmopolitan strains of a single species, the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Investigation of genome-wide within-species variation revealed five general types of variation in SM gene clusters: non-functional gene polymorphisms, gene gain and loss polymorphisms, whole cluster gain and loss polymorphisms, allelic polymorphisms where different alleles corresponded to distinct, non-homologous clusters, and location polymorphisms in which a cluster was found to differ in its genomic location across strains. These polymorphisms affect the function of representative A. fumigatus SM gene clusters, such as those involved in the production of gliotoxin, fumigaclavine, and helvolic acid, as well as the function of clusters with undefined products. In addition to enabling the identification of polymorphisms whose detection requires extensive genome-wide synteny conservation (e.g., mobile gene clusters and non-homologous cluster alleles), our approach also implicated multiple underlying genetic drivers, including point mutations, recombination, genomic deletion and insertion events, as well as horizontal gene transfer from distant fungi. Finally, most of the variants that we uncover within A. fumigatus have been previously hypothesized to contribute to SM gene cluster diversity across entire fungal classes and phyla. We suggest that the drivers of genetic diversity operating within a fungal species shown here are sufficient to explain SM cluster macroevolutionary patterns.",

Compared to full-length MRs, some vertebrate MRs required higher steroid concentrations to activate GAL4-DBD-MR-hinge/LBD constructs. For example, 11-deoxycortisol activated all full-length vertebrate MRs, but did not activate truncated terrestrial vertebrate MRs and was an agonist for truncated zebrafish MR. Progesterone, 19-norProgesterone and spironolactone did not activate full-length and truncated human, alligator and frog MRs. However, at 10 nM, these steroids activated full-length chicken and zebrafish MRs; at 100 nM, these steroids had little activity for truncated chicken MRs, while retaining activity for truncated zebrafish MRs, evidence that regulation of progestin activation of chicken MR resides in NTD/DBD and of zebrafish MR in hinge-LBD. Zebrafish and chicken MRs contain a serine corresponding to Ser810 in human MR, required for its antagonism by progesterone, suggesting novel regulation of progestin activation of chicken and zebrafish MRs.

    "abstract": "Reef-building corals maintain a symbiotic relationship with dinoflagellate algae of the genus Symbiodinium and this symbiosis is vital for the survival of the coral holobiont. Symbiodinium community composition within the coral host has been shown to influence a corals ability to resist and recover from stress. A multitude of stressors including ocean warming, ocean acidification, and eutrophication have been linked to global scale decline in coral health and cover in recent decades. Three distinct thermal regimes (highTP, modTP, and lowTP) following an inshore-offshore gradient of declining average temperatures and thermal variation were identified on the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS). Quantitative metabarcoding of the ITS-2 locus was employed to investigate differences and similarities in Symbiodinium genetic diversity of the Caribbean corals Siderastrea siderea, S. radians, and Pseudodiploria strigosa between the three thermal regimes. A total of ten Symbiodinium lineages were identified across the three coral host species. Siderastrea siderea associated with distinct Symbiodinium communities, however Symbiodinium communities of its congener, S. radians, and P. strigosa, were more similar to one another. Thermal regime played a role in defining Symbiodinium communities in S. siderea but not S. radians or P. strigosa. Against expectations, Symbiodinium trenchii, a symbiont known to confer thermal tolerance, was dominant only in S. siderea at one sampled offshore site and was rare inshore, suggesting that coral thermal tolerance in more thermally variable inshore habitats is achieved through alternative mechanisms. Overall, thermal parameters alone were likely not the only primary drivers of Symbiodinium community composition, suggesting that environmental variables unrelated to temperature (i.e., light availability, or nutrients) may play key roles in structuring coral-algal communities in Belize and that the relative importance of these environmental variables may vary by coral host species.",

    "abstract": "Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) form both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric ion channels that are activated by extracellular protons and are involved in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes, including pain and anxiety. ASIC proteins can form both homotrimeric and heterotrimeric ion channels. The ASIC3 subunit has been shown to be of particular importance in the peripheral nervous system with pharmacological and genetic manipulations demonstrating a role in pain. Naked mole-rats, despite having functional ASICs, are insensitive to acid as a noxious stimulus and show diminished avoidance of acidic fumes, ammonia and carbon dioxide. Here we cloned naked mole-rat ASIC3 (nmrASIC3) and used a cell surface biotinylation assay to demonstrate that it traffics to the plasma membrane, but using whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology we observed that nmrASIC3 is insensitive to both protons and the non-proton ASIC3 agonist 2-Guanidine-4-methylquinazoline (GMQ). However, in line with previous reports of ASIC3 mRNA expression in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, we found that the ASIC3 antagonist APETx2 reversibly inhibits ASIC-like currents in naked mole-rat DRG neurons. We further show that like the proton-insensitive ASIC2b and ASIC4, nmrASIC3 forms functional, proton sensitive heteromers with other ASIC subunits. An amino acid alignment of ASIC3s between 9 relevant rodent species and human identified unique sequence differences that might underlie the proton insensitivity of nmrASIC3. However, introducing nmrASIC3 differences into rat ASIC3 (rASIC3) produced only minor differences in channel function, and replacing nmrASIC3 sequence with that of rASIC3 did not produce a proton-sensitive ion channel. Our observation that nmrASIC3 forms nonfunctional homomers may reflect a further adaptation of the naked mole-rat to living in an environment with high-carbon dioxide levels.",

It allows researchers to develop wg/cgMLST schemes for any bacterial species from a set of genomes of interest. The alleles identified by chewBBACA correspond to potential coding sequences, possibly offering insights into the correspondence between the genetic variability identified and phenotypic variability. The software performs allele calling in a matter of seconds to minutes per strain in a laptop but is easily scalable for the analysis of large datasets of hundreds of thousands of strains using multiprocessing options. The chewBBACA software thus provides an efficient and freely available open source solution for gene-by-gene methods. Moreover, the ability to perform these tasks locally is desirable when the submission of raw data to a central repository or web services is hindered by data protection policies or ethical or legal concerns.",

As a phenotype, risk-taking behaviour therefore fits within a Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach, whereby identifying genetic determinants of this trait has the potential to improve our understanding across different psychiatric disorders. Here we report a genome wide association study in 116 255 UK Biobank participants who responded yes/no to the question \\\"Would you consider yourself a risk-taker?\\\" Risk-takers (compared to controls) were more likely to be men, smokers and have a history of psychiatric disorder. Genetic loci associated with risk-taking behaviour were identified on chromosomes 3 (rs13084531) and 6 (rs9379971). The effects of both lead SNPs were comparable between men and women. The chromosome 3 locus highlights CADM2, previously implicated in cognitive and executive functions, but the chromosome 6 locus is challenging to interpret due to the complexity of the HLA region. Risk-taking behaviour shared significant genetic risk with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, as well as with smoking and total obesity. Despite being based on only a single question, this study furthers our understanding of the biology of risk-taking behaviour, a trait which has a major impact on a range of common physical and mental health disorders.",

    "abstract": "Polycomb Group proteins are essential epigenetic repressors. They form multiple protein complexes of which two kinds, PRC1 and PRC2, are indispensable for repression. Although much is known about their biochemical properties, how PRC1 and PRC2 are targeted to specific genes is poorly understood. Here we establish the Cyclin D2 (CCND2) oncogene as a simple model to address this question. We provide the evidence that coordinated recruitment of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes to CCND2 involves a combination of a specialized PRC1 targeting element (PTE) and an adjacent CpG-island, which together act as a human Polycomb Response Element. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis of CCND2 in different transcriptional states indicates that histone modifications produced by PRC1 and PRC2 are not sufficient to recruit either of the complexes. However, catalytic activity of PRC2 helps to anchor PRC1 at the PTE. Our analyses suggest that coordinated targeting of PRC1 and PRC2 complexes by juxtaposed AT-rich PTEs and CpG-islands may be a general feature of Polycomb repression in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Reef-building corals are highly sensitive to rising ocean temperatures, and substantial adaptation will be required for animals and the ecosystems they support to persist in changing ocean conditions. Genetic variation that might support adaptive responses has been measured in larval stages of some corals, but these estimates remain unavailable for adult corals and the functional basis of this variation remains unclear. In this study, we focused on the potential for adaptation in Orbicella faveolata, a dominant reef-builder in the Caribbean. We conducted thermal stress experiments using corals collected from natural populations in Bocas del Toro, Panama, and used multilocus SNP genotypes to estimate genetic relatedness among samples. This allowed us to estimate narrow-sense heritability of variation in bleaching responses, revealing that this variation was highly heritable (h2=0.91). This estimate suggests substantial potential for adaptive responses to warming by natural populations of O. faveolata in this region. To investigate the functional basis for this variation, we applied genomic and transcriptomic approaches enabled by expanding sequence resources for this species. We used a genetic linkage map we have recently developed to map associations between SNP genotypes and bleaching responses, and identified four genetic markers associated with bleaching. We also profiled gene expression in corals with contrasting bleaching phenotypes, uncovering substantial variation in responses to thermal stress between heat-tolerant and heat-susceptible corals. Integrating these genomic and transcriptomic data with quantitative genetic analysis provides a new perspective on the mechanistic basis for thermal tolerance phenotypes and the potential for adaptation to rising ocean temperatures.",

    "abstract": "The sequence domains underlying long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) activities, including their characteristic nuclear enrichment, remain largely unknown. It has been proposed that these domains can originate from neofunctionalised fragments of transposable elements (TEs), otherwise known as RIDLs (Repeat Insertion Domains of Long Noncoding RNA), although just a handful have been identified. It is challenging to distinguish functional RIDL instances against a numerous genomic background of neutrally-evolving TEs. We here show evidence that a subset of TE types experience evolutionary selection in the context of lncRNA exons. Together these comprise an enrichment group of 5374 TE fragments in 3566 loci. Their host lncRNAs tend to be functionally validated and associated with disease. This RIDL group was used to explore the relationship between TEs and lncRNA subcellular localisation. Using global localisation data from ten human cell lines, we uncover a dose-dependent relationship between nuclear/cytoplasmic distribution, and evolutionarily-conserved L2b, MIRb and MIRc elements. This is observed in multiple cell types, and is unaffected by confounders of transcript length or expression. Experimental validation with engineered transgenes shows that these TEs drive nuclear enrichment in a natural sequence context. Together these data reveal a role for TEs in regulating the subcellular localisation of lncRNAs.",

Here we demonstrate a scalable platform for human cell lineage tracing based on Short Tandem Repeats (STRs) targeted by duplex Molecular Inversion Probes (MIPs). With this platform we accurately reproduced a known lineage of DU145 cell lines cells9 and reconstructed lineages of healthy and metastatic single cells from a melanoma patient. The reconstructed trees matched the anatomical and SNV references while adding further refinements. Our platform allowed to faithfully recapitulate lineages of developmental tissue formation in cells from healthy donors. In summary, our lineage discovery platform can profile informative STR somatic mutations efficiently and we provide a solid, high-resolution lineage reconstruction even in challenging low-mutation-rate healthy single cells.",

    "abstract": "Hemispheric asymmetry is a cardinal feature of human brain organization. Altered brain asymmetry has also been linked to some cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here the ENIGMA consortium presents the largest ever analysis of cerebral cortical asymmetry and its variability across individuals. Cortical thickness and surface area were assessed in MRI scans of 17,141 healthy individuals from 99 datasets worldwide. Results revealed widespread asymmetries at both hemispheric and regional levels, with a generally thicker cortex but smaller surface area in the left hemisphere relative to the right. Regionally, asymmetries of cortical thickness and/or surface area were found in the inferior frontal gyrus, transverse temporal gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex. These regions are involved in lateralized functions, including language and visuospatial processing. In addition to population-level asymmetries, variability in brain asymmetry was related to sex, age, and brain size (indexed by intracranial volume). Interestingly, we did not find significant associations between asymmetries and handedness. Finally, with two independent pedigree datasets (N = 1,443 and 1,113, respectively), we found several asymmetries showing modest but highly reliable heritability. The structural asymmetries identified, and their variabilities and heritability provide a reference resource for future studies on the genetic basis of brain asymmetry and altered laterality in cognitive, neurological, and psychiatric disorders.\\n\\nSignificance StatementLeft-right asymmetry is a key feature of the human brain's structure and function. It remains unclear which cortical regions are asymmetrical on average in the population, and how biological factors such as age, sex and genetic variation affect these asymmetries. Here we describe by far the largest ever study of cerebral cortical brain asymmetry, based on data from 17,141 participants. We found a global anterior-posterior 'torque' pattern in cortical thickness, together with various regional asymmetries at the population level, which have not been previously described, as well as effects of age, sex, and heritability estimates. From these data, we have created an on-line resource that will serve future studies of human brain anatomy in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGypsophila paniculata (babys breath) is an invasive species found throughout much of the northwest United States and western Canada. Recently, plants exhibiting a different color morphology were identified within the coastal dunes along eastern Lake Michigan. The common babys breath (G. paniculata) typically produces stems that are purple in color (purple morph), while the atypical morph has stems that are green-yellow (green-yellow morph). The purpose of this study was to characterize these newly identified morphs and determine if they are genetically distinct species from the common babys breath in order to assess whether alternative management strategies should be employed to control these populations.\\n\\nMethodsWe sequenced two chloroplast regions, rbcL and matK, and one nuclear region, ITS2, from the purple morphs and green-yellow morphs collected from Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, MI, USA (SBDNL). Sequences were aligned to the reference sequences from other Gypsophila species obtained from the Barcode of Life (BOLD) and GenBank databases. We also collected seeds from wild purple morph and wild green-yellow morph plants in SBDNL. We grew the seeds in a common garden setting and characterized the proportion of green-yellow individuals produced from the two color morphs after five-months of growth.\\n\\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses based upon rbcL, matK, and ITS2 regions suggest that the two color morphs are not distinct species and they both belong to G. paniculata. Seeds collected from wild green-yellow morphs produced a significantly higher proportion of green-yellow individuals compared to the number produced by seeds collected from wild purple morphs. However, seeds collected from both color morphs produced more purple morphs than green-yellow morphs.\\n\\nDiscussionBased upon these results, we propose that the two color morphs are variants of G. paniculata. Given the significant difference in the number of green-yellow morphs produced from the seeds of each morph type, we also suggest that this color difference has some genetic basis. We propose that current management continue to treat the two color morphs in a similar manner in terms of removal to prevent the further spread of this species.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMolecular profiling of cancers is now routine at many cancer centers, and the number of precision cancer medicine clinical trials, which are informed by profiling, is steadily rising. Additionally, these trials are becoming increasingly complex, often having multiple arms and many genomic eligibility criteria. Currently, it is a challenging for physicians to match patients to relevant clinical trials using the patients genomic profile, which can lead to missed opportunities. Automated matching against uniformly structured and encoded genomic eligibility criteria is essential to keep pace with the complex landscape of precision medicine clinical trials.\\n\\nResultsTo meet these needs, we built and deployed an automated clinical trial matching platform called MatchMiner at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). The platform has been integrated with Profile, DFCIs enterprise genomic profiling project, which contains tumor profile data for >20,000 patients, and has been made available to physicians across the Institute. As no current standard exists for encoding clinical trial eligibility criteria, a new language called Clinical Trial Markup Language (CTML) was developed, and over 178 genomically-driven clinical trials were encoded using this language. The platform is open source and freely available for adoption by other institutions.\\n\\nConclusionMatchMiner is the first open platform developed to enable computational matching of patient-specific genomic profiles to precision cancer medicine clinical trials. Creating MatchMiner required developing clinical trial eligibility standards to support genome-driven matching and developing intuitive interfaces to support practical use-cases. Given the complexity of tumor profiling and the rapidly changing multi-site nature of genome-driven clinical trials, open source software is the most efficient, scalable, and economical option for matching cancer patients to clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Erythropoiesis is regulated at many levels, including control of mRNA translation. Changing environmental conditions, such as hypoxia, or the availability of nutrients and growth factors, require a rapid response enacted by the enhanced or repressed translation of existing transcripts. Csde1 is an RNA-binding protein required for erythropoiesis and strongly upregulated in erythroblasts relative to other hematopoietic progenitors. The aim of this study is to identify the Csde1-containing protein complexes, and investigate their role in regulating the translation of Csde1-bound transcripts. We show that Strap, also called Unrip, was the protein most strongly associated with Csde1 in erythroblasts. Strap is a WD40 protein involved in signaling and RNA splicing, but its role is unknown when associated with Csde1. Reduced expression of Strap did not alter the pool of transcripts bound by Csde1. Instead, it reduced the mRNA and/or protein expression of several Csde1-bound transcript, that encode for proteins essential for translational regulation during hypoxia, such as Hmbs, eIF4g3 and Pabpc4. Also affected by Strap knockdown were Vim, a Gata-1 target crucial for erythrocyte enucleation, and Elavl1, which stabilizes Gata-1 mRNA. Thus, we found that the Csde1/Strap complex is at the crossroad of multiple pathways governing translation in erythroblasts.",

    "abstract": "Studies of nervous system connectivity, in a wide variety of species and at different scales of resolution, have identified several highly conserved motifs of network organization. One such motif is a heterogeneous distribution of connectivity across neural elements, such that some elements act as highly connected and functionally important network hubs. These brain network hubs are also densely interconnected, forming a so-called rich-club. Recent work in mouse has identified a distinctive transcriptional signature of neural hubs, characterized by tightly coupled expression of oxidative metabolism genes, with similar genes characterizing macroscale inter-modular hub regions of the human cortex. Here, we sought to determine whether hubs of the neuronal C. elegans connectome also show tightly coupled gene expression. Using open data on the chemical and electrical connectivity of 279 C. elegans neurons, and binary gene expression data for each neuron across 948 genes, we computed a correlated gene expression score for each pair of neurons, providing a measure of their gene expression similarity. We demonstrate that connections between hub neurons are the most similar in their gene expression while connections between nonhubs are the least similar. Genes with the greatest contribution to this effect are involved in glutamatergic and cholinergic signalling, and other communication processes. We further show that coupled expression between hub neurons cannot be explained by their neuronal subtype (i.e., sensory, motor, or interneuron), separation distance, chemically secreted neurotransmitter, birth time, pairwise lineage distance, or their topological module affiliation. Instead, this coupling is intrinsically linked to the identity of most hubs as command interneurons, a specific class of interneurons that regulates locomotion. Our results suggest that neural hubs may possess a distinctive transcriptional signature, preserved across scales and species, that is related to the involvement of hubs in regulating the higher-order behaviors of a given organism.\\n\\nAuthor summarySome elements of neural systems possess many more connections than others, marking them as network hubs. These hubs are often densely interconnected with each other, forming a so-called rich-club that is thought to support integrated function. Recent work in the mouse suggests that connected pairs of hubs show higher levels of transcriptional coupling than other pairs of brain regions. Here, we show that hub neurons of the nematode C. elegans also show tightly coupled gene expression and that this effect cannot be explained by the spatial proximity or anatomical location of hub neurons, their chemical composition, birth time, neuronal lineage or topological module affiliation. Instead, we find that elevated coexpression is driven by the identity of most hubs of the C. elegans connectome as command interneurons, a specific functional class of neurons that regulate locomotion.

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are established drug targets. Despite their considerable appeal as targets for next-generation anthelmintics, poor understanding of their diversity and function in parasitic helminths has thwarted progress towards GPCR-targeted anti-parasite drugs. This study facilitates GPCR research in the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, by generating the first profile of GPCRs from the F. hepatica genome. Our dataset describes 146 high confidence GPCRs, representing the largest cohort of GPCRs, and the most complete set of in silico ligand-receptor predictions, yet reported in any parasitic helminth. All GPCRs fall within the established GRAFS nomenclature; comprising three glutamate, 135 rhodopsin, two adhesion, five frizzled and one smoothened GPCR. Stringent annotation pipelines identified 18 highly diverged rhodopsins in F. hepatica that maintained core rhodopsin signatures, but lacked significant similarity with non-flatworm sequences, providing a new sub-group of potential flukicide targets. These facilitated identification of a larger cohort of 76 related sequences from available flatworm genomes, representing new members of existing groups of flatworm-specific rhodopsins. These receptors imply flatworm specific GPCR functions, and/or co-evolution with unique flatworm ligands, and could facilitate development of exquisitely selective anthelminthics. Ligand binding domain sequence conservation relative to deorphanised rhodopsins enabled high confidence ligand-receptor matching of seventeen receptors activated by acetylcholine, neuropeptide F/Y, octopamine or serotonin. RNA-Seq analyses showed expression of 101 GPCRs across various developmental stages, with the majority expressed most highly in the pathogenic intra-mammalian juvenile parasites. These data identify a broad complement of GPCRs in F. hepatica, including rhodopsins likely to have key functions in neuromuscular control and sensory perception, as well as frizzled and adhesion families implicated, in other species, in growth, development and reproduction. This catalogue of liver fluke GPCRs provides a platform for new avenues into our understanding of flatworm biology and anthelmintic discovery.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryFasciola spp. liver fluke are important veterinary pathogens with impacts on human and animal health, and food security, around the world. Liver fluke have developed resistance to most of the drugs used to treat them (flukicides). Since no vaccines exist, we need to develop new flukicides as a matter of urgency. Most anthelmintic drugs used to treat parasitic worm infections operate by impeding the functioning of their nerve and muscle. In flatworms, most nervous signals are received by a type of receptor called a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Since GPCRs control important parasite functions (e.g. movement, egg-laying, feeding), they represent appealing targets for new flukicides, but have not yet been targeted as such. This work exploited the F. hepatica genome to determine the quantity and diversity of GPCRs in liver fluke. We found more GPCRs in the Fasciola genome than have been reported in any other parasitic worm. These findings provide a foundation that for researchers to determine the functions of these receptors, and which molecules/ligands they are activated by. These data will pave the way to exploring the potential of F. hepatica GPCRs as targets for new flukicides.",

    "abstract": "Human brain mapping relies heavily on fMRI, ECoG and EEG, which capture different physiological signals. Relationships between these signals have been established in the context of specific tasks or during resting state, often using spatially confined concurrent recordings in animals. But it is not certain whether these correlations generalize to other contexts relevant for human cognitive neuroscience. Here, we address the case of complex naturalistic stimuli and ask two basic questions. First, how reliable are the responses evoked by a naturalistic audio-visual stimulus in each of these imaging methods, and second, how similar are stimulus-related responses across methods? To this end, we investigated a wide range of brain regions and frequency bands. We presented the same movie clip twice to three different cohorts of subjects (NEEG = 45, NfMRI = 11, NECoG = 5) and assessed stimulus-driven correlations across viewings and between imaging methods, thereby ruling out task-irrelevant confounds. All three imaging methods had similar repeat-reliability across viewings when fMRI and EEG data were averaged across subjects, highlighting the potential to achieve large signal-to-noise ratio by leveraging large sample sizes. The fMRI signal correlated positively with high-frequency ECoG power across multiple task-related cortical structures but positively with low-frequency EEG and ECoG power. In contrast to previous studies, these correlations were as strong for low-frequency as for high frequency ECoG. We also observed links between fMRI and infra-slow EEG voltage fluctuations. These results extend previous findings to the case of natural stimulus processing.",

Compared to wild-type BRAF (BRAFWT) disease, stage II/III CC patients with BRAF mutant (BRAFMT) tumors have shorter overall survival after relapse; however, time-to-relapse is not significantly different. The aim of this investigation was to identify, and validate, novel predictors of relapse of stage II/III BRAFMT CC.\\n\\nPatients and methodsWe used gene expression data from a cohort of 460 patients (GSE39582) to perform a supervised classification analysis based on risk-of-relapse within BRAFMT stage II/III CC, to identify transcriptomic biomarkers associated with prognosis within this genotype.

    "abstract": "AbstractIsoscapes are maps depicting the continuous spatial (and sometimes temporal) variation in isotope composition. They have various applications ranging from the study of isotope circulation in the main earth systems to the determination of the provenance of migratory animals. Isoscapes can be produced from the fit of statistical models to observations originating from a set of discrete locations. Mixed models are powerful tools for drawing inferences from correlated data. While they are widely used to study non-spatial variation, they are often overlooked in spatial analyses. In particular, they have not been used to study the spatial variation of isotope composition. Here, we introduce this statistical framework and illustrate the methodology by building isoscapes of the isotope composition of hydrogen (measured in{delta} 2H) for precipitation water in Europe. For this example, the approach based on mixed models presents a higher predictive power than a widespread alternative approach. We discuss other advantages offered by mixed models including: the ability to model the residual variance in isotope composition, the quantification of prediction uncertainty, and the simplicity of model comparison and selection using an adequate information criterion: the conditional AIC (cAIC).

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) reveals aging as a transcriptomic drift along a single direction, consistent across the vastly diverse biological conditions and coinciding with the first principal component, a hallmark of the criticality of the underlying gene regulatory network. We, therefore, expected that the organisms aging state could be characterized by a single number closely related to vitality deficit or biological age. The \\\"aging trajectory\\\", i.e. the dependence of the biological age on chronological age, is then a universal stochastic function modulated by the network stiffness; a macroscopic parameter reflecting the network topology and associated with the rate of aging. To corroborate this view, we used publicly available datasets to define a transcriptomic biomarker of age and observed that the rescaling of age by lifespan simultaneously brings together aging trajectories of transcription and survival curves. In accordance with the theoretical prediction, the limiting mortality value at the plateau agrees closely with the mortality rate doubling exponent estimated at the cross-over age near the average lifespan. Finally, we used the transcriptomic signature of age to identify possible life-extending drug compounds and successfully tested a handful of the top ranking molecules in C. elegans survival assays and achieved up to a +30% extension of mean and median lifespan.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is unknown if the association between delirium and mortality is consistent for individuals across the whole range of health states. A bimodal relationship has been proposed, where delirium is particularly adverse for those with underlying frailty, but may have a smaller effect (perhaps even protective) if it is an early indicator of acute illness in fitter people. We investigated the impact of delirium on mortality in a cohort simultaneously evaluated for frailty.\\n\\nMethodsWe undertook an exploratory analysis of a cohort of consecutive acute medical admissions aged [&ge;]70. Delirium on admission was ascertained by psychiatrists. A Frailty Index (FI) was derived according to a standard approach. Deaths were notified from linked national mortality statistics. Cox regression was used to estimate associations between delirium, frailty and their interactions on mortality.\\n\\nResultsThe sample consisted of 710 individuals. Both delirium and frailty were independently associated with increased mortality rates (delirium: HR 2.4, 95%CI 1.8-3.3, p<0.01; frailty (per SD): HR 3.5, 95%CI 1.2-9.9, p=0.02). Estimating the effect of delirium in tertiles of FI, mortality was greatest in the lowest tertile: tertile 1 HR 3.4 (95%CI 2.1-5.6); tertile 2 HR 2.7 (95%CI 1.5-4.6); tertile 3 HR 1.9 (95% CI 1.2-3.0).\\n\\nConclusionWhile delirium and frailty contribute to mortality, the overall impact of delirium on admission appears to be greater at lower levels of frailty.

In virtual audio systems, which aim to emulate these effects, non-individualized, generic HRTFs are typically used leading to an inaccurate perception of virtual sound location. Training has the potential to exploit the brains ability to adapt to these unfamiliar cues. In this study, three virtual sound localization training paradigms were evaluated; one provided simple visual positional confirmation of sound source location, a second introduced game design elements (\"gamification\") and a final version additionally utilized head-tracking to provide listeners with experience of relative sound source motion (\"active listening\"). The results demonstrate a significant effect of training after a small number of short (12-minute) training sessions, which is retained across multiple days. Gamification alone had no significant effect on the efficacy of the training, but active listening resulted in a significantly greater improvements in localization accuracy. In general, improvements in virtual sound localization following training generalized to a second set of non-individualized HRTFs, although some HRTF-specific changes were observed in polar angle judgement for the active listening group. The implications of this on the putative mechanisms of the adaptation process are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The adhesion of HIV gp120 antigen to human cells is modulated in part by interactions with heparan sulfate. The HXB2 strain of gp120 has been shown to interact with heparin primarily through the V3 loop, although other domains including the C-terminal domain were also implicated. However, the JR-FL strain (representative of CCR5-interacting strains that make up newest infections) was shown to have a drastically lowered affinity to heparin due to the loss of several basic residues in the V3 loop, and deletion of the V3 loop in JR-FL gp120 was shown to abrogate some, but not all, heparin binding. Here, we use high resolution hydroxyl radical protein footprinting to measure the changes in protein surface oxidation levels that result from the binding of a model heparin fragment (fondaparinux). Protection in both the V3 loop and the N-terminus of JR-FP gp120 is observed. The well-defined composition of fondaparinux allowed us to perform docking simulations, which showed two clusters of fondaparinux binding: the V3 loop, and a domain consisting of the N- and C-termini. Together, the experimental and theoretical results indicate the heparin/heparan sulfate binding sites on JR-FL gp120 and the efficient interaction of fondaparinux, a widely exploited therapeutic carbohydrate, on gp120.",

    "abstract": "Sequence clustering is a fundamental step in analyzing DNA sequences. Widely-used software tools for sequence clustering utilize greedy approaches that are not guaranteed to produce the best results. These tools are sensitive to one parameter that determines the similarity among sequences in a cluster. Often times, a biologist may not know the exact sequence similarity. Therefore, clusters produced by these tools do not likely match the real clusters comprising the data if the provided parameter is inaccurate. To overcome this limitation, we adapted the mean shift algorithm, an unsupervised machine-learning algorithm, which has been used successfully thousands of times in fields such as image processing and computer vision. The theory behind the mean shift algorithm, unlike the greedy approaches, guarantees convergence to the modes, e.g. cluster centers. Here we describe the first application of the mean shift algorithm to clustering DNA sequences. MeShClust is one of few applications of the mean shift algorithm in bioinformatics. Further, we applied supervised machine learning to predict the identity score produced by global alignment using alignment-free methods. We demonstrate MeShClusts ability to cluster DNA sequences with high accuracy even when the sequence similarity parameter provided by the user is not very accurate.",

As a result, a reliable and systematically generated protein wiring diagram is crucial for a deeper understanding of cellular functions. Unfortunately, current human protein networks are noisy and incomplete. Also, they suffer from both study and technical biases: heavily studied proteins (e.g. those of pharmaceutical interest) are known to be involved in more interactions than proteins described in only a few publications. Here, we use the experimental evidence supporting the interaction between proteins, in conjunction with the so-called disparity filter, to construct a reliable and unbiased proteome-scale human interactome. The application of a global filter, i.e. only considering interactions with multiple pieces of evidence, would result in an excessively pruned network. In contrast, the disparity filter preserves interactions supported by a statistically significant number of studies and does not overlook small-scale protein associations.

Currently, we have a limited understanding of how geometrical properties of microtubule arrays, in turn, regulate the output of crosslinking proteins. Here we investigate this problem in the context of microtubule sliding by two interacting proteins: the non-motor crosslinker PRC1 and the kinesin Kif4A. The collective activity of PRC1 and Kif4A also results in their accumulation at microtubule plus-ends ( end-tag). Sliding stalls when the end-tags on antiparallel microtubules collide, forming a stable overlap. Interestingly, we find that structural properties of the initial array regulate PRC1-Kif4A mediated microtubule organization. First, sliding velocity scales with initial microtubule-overlap length. Second, the width of the final overlap scales with microtubule lengths. Our analyses reveal how micron-scale geometrical features of antiparallel microtubules can regulate the activity of nanometersized proteins to define the structure and mechanics of microtubule-based architectures.",

Filaments consisting of NM2-B moved processively along actin, while under identical conditions, NM2-A filaments did not. By more closely mimicking the physiological milieu, either by increasing solution viscosity or by copolymerization with NM2-B, NM2-A containing filaments moved processively. Our data demonstrate that both the kinetic and mechanical properties of these two myosins, in addition to the stochiometry of NM-2 subunits, can tune filament mechanical output.

    "abstract": "AbstractTemporal control of physiology requires the interplay between gene networks involved in daily timekeeping and tissue function across different organs. How the circadian clock interweaves with tissue-specific transcriptional programs is poorly understood. Here we dissected temporal and tissue-specific regulation at multiple gene regulatory layers by examining mouse tissues with an intact or disrupted clock over time. Integrated analysis uncovered two distinct regulatory modes underlying tissue-specific rhythms: tissue-specific oscillations in transcription factor (TF) activity, which were linked to feeding-fasting cycles in liver and sodium homeostasis in kidney; and co-localized binding of clock and tissue-specific transcription factors at distal enhancers. Chromosome conformation capture (4C-Seq) in liver and kidney identified liver-specific chromatin loops that recruited clock-bound enhancers to promoters to regulate liver-specific transcriptional rhythms. Furthermore, this looping was remarkably promoter-specific on the scale of less than ten kilobases. Enhancers can contact a rhythmic promoter while looping out nearby nonrhythmic alternative promoters, confining rhythmic enhancer activity to specific promoters. These findings suggest that chromatin folding enables the clock to regulate rhythmic transcription of specific promoters to output temporal transcriptional programs tailored to different tissues.",

Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze some genetic features of clinical strains collected in Italy in 2012.\\n\\nWe conducted fibronectin-collagen-T antigen (FCT) region typing and emm typing in 122 S. pyogenes strains. Furthermore, several additional virulence genes were screened by polymerase chain reaction.\\n\\nWe found correlations between emm types and FCT region profiles. emm1 strains were mainly associated with FCT2 and FCT6, while emm89 and emm12 strains were associated with FCT4. FCT5 was mainly represented in emm4, emm6, and emm75 strains. Noteworthy, we defined subtypes for each FCT type based on the differences in single and multiple loci compared to the reference scheme used for the classification of the FCT region. In addition, new FCT types were identified. Cluster analysis based on virulence gene profiling showed a non-random distribution within each emm type.\\n\\nThis study showed the high variability of S. pyogenes strains and the great diversification that this pathogen has undergone during its evolution in the human host.",

    "abstract": "During sleep, memories formed during the day are consolidated in a dialogue between cortex and hippocampus. The reactivation of specific neural activity patterns - replay - during sleep has been observed in both structures and is hypothesized to represent a neuronal substrate of consolidation. In the hippocampus, replay happens during sharp wave - ripples (SWR), short bouts of excitatory activity in area CA3 which induce high frequency oscillations in area CA1. In particular, recordings of hippocampal cells which spike at a specific location ( place cells) show that recently learned trajectories are reactivated during SWR in the following sleep SWR. Despite the importance of sleep replay, its underlying neural mechanisms are still poorly understood.\\n\\nWe developed a model of SWR activity, to study the effects of learning-induced synaptic changes on spontaneous sequence reactivation during SWR. The model implemented a paradigm including three epochs: Pre-sleep, learning and Post-sleep activity. We first tested the effects of learning on the hippocampal network activity through changes in a minimal number of synapses connecting selected pyramidal cells. We then introduced an explicit trajectory-learning task to the model, to obtain behavior-induced synaptic changes. The model revealed that the recently learned trajectory reactivates during sleep more often than other trajectories in the training field. The study predicts that the gain of reactivation rate during sleep following vs sleep preceding learning for a trained sequence of pyramidal cells depends on Pre-sleep activation of the same sequence, and on the amount of trajectory repetitions included in the training phase.",

Such exposure can result in chromosomal aberrations increasing the likelihood of the development of cancer. Early detection and mitigation of these events is critical in providing positive outcomes. In order to aid in the development of portable devices used to measure radiation exposure, we constructed a genome-wide screen to detect transcriptional changes in peripheral blood lymphocytes shortly after (approximately 1 hour) radiation exposure at low (0.3 Gy), medium (1.5 Gy) and high (3.0 Gy) doses compared to control (0.0 Gy) using Affymetrix(R) Human Gene 1.0 ST v1 microarrays. Our results indicate a number of sensitive and specific transcriptional profiles induced by radiation exposure that can potentially be implemented as biomarkers for radiation exposure as well as dose effect. For overall immediate radiation exposure, KDELC1, MRPS30, RARS, and HEXIM1 were determined to be effective biomarkers while PRDM9, CHST4, and SLC26A10 were determined to be biomarkers specific to 0.3 Gy exposure; RPH, CCDC96, WDYHV1, and IFNA16 were identified for 1.5 Gy exposure; and CWC15, CHCHD7, and DNAAF2 were determined to be sensitive and specific to 3.0 Gy exposure.

    "abstract": "Histone modifications play important roles in gene regulation, heredity, imprinting, and many human diseases including diabetes, obesity, and cancer. The histone code is complex and consists of more than 100 marks. Therefore, biologists need computational tools to characterize general signatures representing the distributions of tens of chromatin marks around thousands of regions. To this end, we developed a software tool called HebbPlot, which utilizes a Hebb neural network in learning a general chromatin signature from regions with a common function. Hebb networks can learn the associations between tens of marks and thousands of regions. This is the first application of Hebb networks in the epigenetics field. HebbPlot presents a signature as a digitized image, in which a bright pixel indicates the presence of a mark around a part of the genetic element, and a black pixel indicates the absence of the mark. A row of pixels represents one mark. Similar rows are clustered in the image. We validated HebbPlot on synthetic data and on 111 epigenomes provided by the Roadmap Epigenomics Project. HebbPlot was able to retrieve distinct chromatin signatures for promoters, enhancers, and genes active in each of the 111 cell types. Our analysis reveals that active promoters have a directional signature; marks such as H3K79(me1/me2), H3K4(me1,me2,me3), and H3K9ac stretch toward coding regions. The plots of inactive promoters show that H3K27me3 is consistently present around them. Further, the signatures of enhancers that are fully included in repetitive regions are almost identical to those located outside repeats, indicating that transposons have an enhancer-like function in the human genome. Furthermore, the chromatin signature of active elements consists of the presence of H3K79me1 and the absence of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3. In sum, HebbPlot is a general tool that can be applied to wide array of studies, facilitating the deciphering of the histone code.\\n\\nAuthor summaryChromatin marks have gained much attention because of their important roles in gene regulation, cell differentiation, Lamarckian inheritance, and imprinting. A chromatin signature of a genetic element, such as genes or enhancers, consists of multiple marks and may differ from a tissue to a tissue. Currently, tens of histone modifications are known. Several marks of more than 100 human cell types have been determined. Many epigenomes of other normal and pathological cell types will be available soon.\\n\\nExtracting a chromatin signature representing the distributions of tens of marks around thousands of regions is a challenging task. Hebb networks are a special type of artificial neural networks known for their ability to learn associations. We developed a software tool called HebbPlot. The tool uses a Hebb network to learn how a mark is distributed around a set of regions that have the same function, e.g. promoters active in the same tissue. HebbPlot produces a pattern representing mark distributions around all of the regions. Mark patterns are clustered based on their similarity to one another. Then a digitized image representing the learned pattern is generated. HebbPlot will help biologist with characterizing and visualizing chromatin signatures in numerous studies.",

    "abstract": "In teleosts, the yolk syncytial layer is a multinucleate syncytium that functions as an extraembryonic signaling center to pattern the mesendoderm, coordinate morphogenesis and supply nutrients to the embryo. The zebrafish is an excellent system for studying this morphogenetically active tissue. The external yolk syncytial nuclei (e-YSN) undergo microtubule dependent epiboly movements that distribute the nuclei over the yolk. How e-YSN epiboly proceeds, and what role the yolk microtubule network plays is not understood but currently it is proposed that e-YSN are pulled vegetally as the microtubule network shortens from the vegetal pole. Data from our live imaging studies suggest that the yolk microtubule network is dismantled from the animal and vegetal regions and show that a region of stabilized microtubules forms before nuclear migration begins. e-YSN do not appear to be pulled vegetally but rather move along a dynamic microtubule network. We also show that overexpression of the KASH domain of Syne2a impairs e-YSN movement, implicating the LINC complex in e-YSN migration. This work provides new insights into the role of microtubules in morphogenesis of an extraembryonic tissue.\\n\\nSummary StatementAnalysis of yolk syncytial nuclear migration during zebrafish epiboly reveals that nuclei migrate along and largely beneath a dynamically yolk microtubule network.",

However, it is rather sensitive to borrowing events, coding errors, semantic shift and other anomalies, so other models, in particular the covarion model, tends to have a better fit to the data. Here, we introduce the pseudo Dollo model, a model of character evolution along a tree that can be formulated as a three-state continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) model. The initial state represent absence of a feature, then a birth event allows the feature to be present. A death event can follow so that the feature becomes absent again. However, no new birth events are allowed after a death event has taken place.\\n\\nWe examine the model in a fully Bayesian setting, and demonstrate it can have a better fit than some of the popular alternative models on some real world datasets. Some variations on the pseudo Dollo model are introduced as well, including the multi-state pseudo Dollo model and pseudo Dollo covarion model.\\n\\nThe model is implemented in open source software Babel, a package to BEAST [2] licensed under LGPL.

    "abstract": "Flight initiation distance (FID), the distance at which an organism flees from an approaching threat, is an ecological metric of cost-benefit functions of escape decisions. We adapted the FID paradigm to investigate how fast or slow attacking  virtual predators constrain escape decisions. We show that rapid escape decisions rely on  reactive fear circuits in the periaqueductal gray and midcingulate cortex (MCC), while protracted escape decisions, defined by larger buffer zones, were associated with  cognitive fear circuits which include posterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, circuits implicated in strategic avoidance and behavioral flexibility. Using a Bayesian Decision Model, we further show that optimization of escape decisions under rapid flight were localized to the MCC, a region involved in adaptive motor control, while the hippocampus is implicated in optimizing decisions that update and control slower escape initiation. These results demonstrate an unexplored link between defensive survival circuits and their role in adaptive escape decisions.\\n\\nSignificanceHumans, like other animals, have evolved a set of circuits whose primary function is survival. In the case of predation, these circuits include  reactive fear circuits involved in fast and immediate escape decisions and  cognitive fear circuits that are involved in the conscious feeling of threat as well as slow strategic escape. Using neuroimaging combined with computational modeling, we support this differentiation of fear circuits by showing that fast escape decisions are elicited by the periaqueductal gray and MCC, regions involved in reactive flight. Conversely, slower escape decisions rely on the hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex and prefrontal cortex, a circuit implicated in behavioral flexibility. These results support the role of the defensive survival circuitry in escape decisions and a separation of fear into reactive and cognitive circuits.",

    "abstract": "Cortical sensory systems often activate in parallel, even when stimulation is experienced through a single sensory modality1-3. Critically, the functional relationship between coactivated cortical systems is unclear: Co-activations may reflect the interactive coupling between information-linked cortical systems or merely parallel but independent sensory processing. Here, we report causal evidence that human somatosensory cortex (S1), which co-activates with auditory cortex during the processing of vibrations and textures4-9, interactively couples to cortical systems that support auditory perception. Acute manipulation of S1 activity using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) impairs auditory frequency perception when subjects simultaneously attend to auditory and tactile frequency, but not when attention is directed to audition alone. Auditory frequency perception is unaffected by TMS over visual cortex thus confirming the privileged coupling between the somatosensory and auditory cortical systems in temporal frequency processing10-13. Our results provide a key demonstration that selective attention can enhance the functional coupling between cortical systems that support different sensory modalities. The gating of crossmodal coupling by selective attention may critically support multisensory interactions and feature-specific perception.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsS.C. and J.M.Y. designed the study and wrote the manuscript.

Behavioral assessments of scene similarity reflected unique contributions from a functional feature model indicating potential actions in scenes as well as high-level visual features from a deep neural network (DNN). In contrast, similarity of cortical responses in scene-selective areas was uniquely explained by mid- and high-level DNN features only, while an object label model did not contribute uniquely to either domain. The striking dissociation between functional and DNN features in their contribution to behavioral and brain representations of scenes indicates that scene-selective cortex represents only a subset of behaviorally relevant scene information.",

In Arabidopsis leaves, the development of stomata, two-celled epidermal valves that mediate plant-atmosphere gas exchange, relies on a series of oriented stem-cell-like asymmetric divisions followed by a single symmetric division. The stomatal lineage is embedded in a tissue whose cells transition from proliferation to post-mitotic differentiation earlier, necessitating stomatal lineage-specific factors to prolong competence to divide. We show that the D-type cyclin, CYCD7;1 is specifically expressed just prior to the symmetric guard-cell forming division, and that it is limiting for this division. Further, we find that CYCD7;1 is capable of promoting divisions in multiple contexts, likely through RBR-dependent promotion of the G1/S transition, but that CYCD7;1 is regulated at the transcriptional level by cell-type specific transcription factors that confine its expression to the appropriate developmental window.",

    "abstract": "Abstract (180 words)Stomatal guard cells are formed through a sequence of asymmetric and symmetric divisions in the epidermis of the sporophyte of most land plants. We show that several D-type cyclins are consecutively activated in the stomatal linage in the epidermis of Arabidopsis thaliana. Whereas CYCD2;1 and CYCD3;2 are activated in the meristemoids early in the lineage, CYCD7;1 is activated before the final division. CYCD7;1 expression peaks in the guard mother cell, where its transcription is modulated by the FOUR-LIPS/MYB88 transcription factor. FOUR-LIPS/MYB88 interacts with the CYCD7;1 promoter and represses CYCD7;1 transcription. CYCD7;1 stimulates the final symmetric division in the stomatal lineage, since guard cell formation is delayed in the cycd7;1 mutant epidermis and guard mother cell (GMC) divisions in four-lips mutant guard mother cells are limited by loss of function of CYCD7;1. Hence, the precise activation of a specific D-type cyclin, CYCD7;1, is required for correct timing of the last symmetric division that creates the stomatal guards cells, and CYCD7;1 expression is regulated by the FLP/MYB pathway that ensures cell cycle arrest in the stomatal guard cells.\\n\\nSummary StatementThe formation of paired guard cells in the epidermis of the Arabidopsis thaliana shoot, requires the activity of the D-type cyclin CYCD7;1 for the normal timing of the final division.",

    "abstract": "The development of resistance to chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure in breast cancer. Although several molecular mechanisms of chemotherapeutic resistance are well studied, a quantitative understanding of the dynamics of resistant subpopulations within a heterogeneous tumor cell population remains elusive. While mathematical models describing the dynamics of heterogeneous cancer cell populations have been proposed, few have been experimentally validated due to the complex nature of resistance that limits the ability of a single phenotypic marker to sufficiently isolate drug resistant subpopulations. In this work, we address this problem with a combined experimental and modeling system that uses drug sensitivity data to reveal the composition of multiple subpopulations differing in their level of drug resistance. We calibrate time-resolved dose-response data to three mathematical models to interrogate the models ability to capture the dynamics of drug. All three models demonstrated an increase in population level resistance following drug exposure. The candidate models were compared by Akaike information criterion and the model selection criteria identified a multi-state model incorporating the role of population heterogeneity and cellular plasticity. To validate the ability of this model to identify the composition of subpopulations, we mixed wild-type MCF-7 and MCF-7/ADR resistant cells at various proportions and evaluated the corresponding model output. Our blinded two-state model was able to estimate the proportions of cell subtypes, with the measured proportions falling within the 95 percent confidence intervals on the parameter estimations and at an R-squared value of 0.986. To the best of our knowledge, this contribution represents the first work to combine experimental time-resolved drug sensitivity data with a mathematical model of resistance development.",

    "abstract": "Males of Gryllus bimaculatus (two-spotted cricket) emit acoustic signals by stridulating two forewings. One of their songs, calling song, plays a role in attracting females to mate, yet the significance of each song trait in attracting conspecific females remains unclear. Among such traits, the relevance of frequency component (i.e. song pitch) has been underestimated, as orthopterans had long been believed incapable of song pitch recognition. However, recent literatures suggested that ears of orthopteran species are capable of frequency recognition as mammalians do. My previous report demonstrated that their calling song recorded from mature adults has constant and pure peak frequency component around 5.7 kHz, further supporting a biological significance of the frequency component. In this study, I tracked its change over time in sexual maturity phase (i.e. from early adult phase). 300 calling songs were recorded over time from a pool of 122 adult crickets, as it required large number of animals because the crickets rarely sing at very early adult stage. A maturation process of calling song was observed, where the peak frequency distributed lower and more variable frequency in early adult phase (e.g. mean peak value was 4.9 kHz on day 3), then it gradually increased and converged to 5.8 kHz with two weeks. The coefficient of variance also decreased over the process, showing minimum around day 20. Also, I found that the young crickets (supposed to emit immature song), emit perfectly tuned calling song with 5.8 kHz peak in helium-substituted (80% Helium and 20% Oxygen) environment. These findings suggest that the robustly regulated frequency of the calling song is acquired during the early-to-mid adult stage, and it may be associated with sexual maturity of males. Also, the helium-substitution experiment suggests that physical resistance from surrounding gas molecules negatively impacts stability of calling songs of young males, implying that a muscle development and/or forewing hardening may help song maturation. This study highlights a biological significance of the frequency component, such that females may adaptively select sexually mature males based on the song trait.",

    "abstract": "Feathers are one of the defining characteristics of birds and serve a critical role in thermal insulation and physical protection against the environment. Feather structure is known to vary among individuals, and it has been suggested that populations exposed to different environmental conditions may exhibit different patterns in feather structure. We examined both down and contour feathers from two populations of male Torrent Ducks (Merganetta armata) from Lima, Peru, including one high-altitude population from the Chancay-Huaral River at approximately 3500 meters (m) elevation and one low-altitude population from the Chillon River at approximately 1500 m. Down feather structure differed significantly between the two populations. Ducks from the high-altitude population had longer, denser down compared with low-altitude individuals. Contour feather structure varied greatly among individuals but showed no significant difference between populations. These results suggest that the innermost, insulative layer of plumage (the down), may have developed in response to lower ambient temperatures at high elevations. The lack of observable differences in the contour feathers may be due to the general constraints of the waterproofing capability of this outer plumage layer.\\n\\nResumenEl plumaje es una caracteristica que define a las aves y cumple roles criticos en el aislamiento termico y proteccion fisica del ambiente.

Los patos de la poblacion a grandes elevaciones tienen plumones largos, y densos comparados con los individuos de las partes bajas. La estructura de las plumas de contorno varia ampliamente entre individuos pero no muestra diferencias significativas entre poblaciones. Estos resultados sugieren que las diferencias entre las capas interiores de aislamiento del plumaje (plumon), haberse desarrollado como respuesta en ambientes de bajas temperaturas a grandes elevaciones. En cambio la falta de detectables diferencias en las plumas de contorno puede ser debido a la constante seleccion en la capacidad impermeable de la capa de plumas exteriores.",

    "abstract": "Argonaute proteins (Agos) are present in all domains of life. While the physiological function of eukaryotic Agos in regulating gene expression is well documented, the biological roles of many of their prokaryotic counterparts remain enigmatic. In some bacteria, Agos are associated with CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) loci and use non-canonical 5-hydroxyled guide RNAs (gRNAs) for nucleic acid targeting. Here we show that using 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) as the 5 nucleotide of gRNAs stabilizes in vitro reconstituted CRISPR-associated Marinitoga piezophila Argonaute-gRNA complexes (MpAgo RNPs) and significantly improves their specificity and affinity for RNA targets. Using reconstituted MpAgo RNPs with 5-BrdU modified gRNAs, we mapped the seed region of the gRNA, and identified the nucleotides of the gRNA that play the most significant role in targeting specificity. We also show that these MpAgo RNPs can be programmed to distinguish between substrates that differ by a single nucleotide, using permutations at the 6th and 7th positions in the gRNA. Using these specificity features, we employed MpAgo RNPs to detect specific Adenosine to Inosine edited RNAs in a complex mixture. These findings broaden our mechanistic understanding of the interactions of Argonautes with guide and substrate RNAs, and demonstrate that MpAgo RNPs with 5-BrdU modified gRNAs can be used as a highly-specific RNA-targeting platform to probe RNA biology.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEArgonaute proteins are present in bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. They play an important role in a wide range of biological processes, from transcriptional and translational gene expression regulation to defense against viruses and silencing of mobile genetic elements. Here we present mechanistic insights into the interactions of the CRISPR-associated Marinitoga piezophila Argonaute (MpAgo) with its guide RNA (gRNA) and RNA substrates. By modifying the 5-nucleotide of the gRNA, we demonstrate that MpAgo-gRNA complexes (RNPs) are easily programmable, have high affinity to fully complementary RNA substrates, and can discriminate by over 300 fold between substrates that differ by only a single nucleotide. These MpAgo RNPs should be useful for probing endogenous RNAs in living cells.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria and archaea destroy foreign nucleic acids by mounting an RNA-based CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune response1-3. In type I CRISPR-Cas systems, the most frequently found type of CRISPR in bacteria and archaea3,4, foreign DNAs that trigger efficient immunity can also provoke primed acquisition of protospacers into the CRISPR locus5-12. Both interference and primed acquisition require Cascade (CRISPR-associated complex for antiviral defense) and the Cas3 helicase/nuclease. Primed acquisition also requires the Cas1-Cas2 integrase; however, the biophysical mechanisms of how interference and primed acquisition are coordinated have remained elusive. Here, we present single-molecule characterization of the type I-E Thermobifida fusca (Tfu) primed acquisition complex (PAC). TfuCascade rapidly samples non-specific DNA for its target via facilitated one-dimensional (1D) diffusion. An evolutionary-conserved positive patch on the Cse1 subunit increases the target recognition efficiency by promoting this 1D diffusion. Cas3 loads at target-bound Cascade and the Cascade/Cas3 complex initiates processive translocation via a looped DNA intermediate. Moving Cascade/Cas3 complexes stall and release the DNA loop at protein roadblocks. Cas1-Cas2 samples DNA transiently via 3D collisions, but stably associates with target-bound Cascade. Cas1-Cas2 also remains associated with translocating Cascade/Cas3, forming the PAC. By directly imaging all key subcomplexes involved in target recognition, interference, and primed acquisition, this work provides a molecular basis for the coordinated steps in CRISPR-based adaptive immunity.",

    "abstract": "Currently the origin and trajectories of novel traits are emphasised in evolutionary studies, the role of stabilization is neglected, and interpretations are often post hoc rather than as hypothesised responses to stated agents of selection. Here we evaluated the impact of changing environmental conditions on trait evolution and stabilization and their relative contribution to diversification in a prominent Australian genus, Hakea (Proteaceae). We assembled a time-based phylogeny for Hakea, reconstructed its ancestral traits for six attributes and determined their evolutionary trajectories in response to the advent or increasing presence of fire, seasonality, aridity, nectar-feeding birds and (in)vertebrate herbivores/granivores. The ancestral Hakea arose 18 million years ago (Ma) and was broad-leaved, non-spinescent, insect-pollinated, had medium-sized, serotinous fruits and resprouted after fire. Of the 190 diversification events that yielded the 82 extant species analysed, 8-50% involved evolution, stabilization or re-evolution (reversal) of individual novel traits. Needle leaves appeared 14 Ma and increased through the Neogene/Quaternary coinciding with intensifying seasonality and aridity. Spinescence arose 12 Ma consistent with the advent of vertebrate herbivores. Bird-pollination appeared 14 Ma in response to advent of the Meliphagidae in the early Miocene. Small and large woody fruits evolved from 12 Ma as alternative defenses against granivory. Fire-caused death evolved 14 Ma, accounting for 50% of subsequent events, as fire became less stochastic. Loss of serotiny began in the late Miocene as non-fireprone habitats became available but only contributed 8% of events. Innovation and subsequent stabilization of functional traits promoted the overall species diversification rate in Hakea by 15 times such that only three species now retain the ancestral phenotype. Our approach holds great promise for understanding the processes responsible for speciation of organisms when the ancestral condition can be identified and the likely selective agents are understood.",

This study investigates the relationship between epigenetic aging and risk and protective factors of PTSD. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis was performed in 211 individuals including combat-exposed Australian veterans (discovery cohort, n = 96 males) and trauma-exposed civilian males from the Grady Trauma Project (replication cohort, n = 115 males). Primary measures included the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CDRISC). DNAm age prediction was performed using the validated epigenetic clock calculator. Veterans with PTSD had increased PTSD symptom severity (P-value = 3.75 x 10-34) and lower CDRISC scores (P-value = 7.5 x 10-8) than veterans without PTSD. DNAm age was significantly correlated with the chronological age (P-value = 3.3 x 10-6), but DNAm age acceleration was not different between the PTSD and non-PTSD groups (P-value = 0.24). Evaluating potential protective factors, we found that DNAm age acceleration was significantly associated with CDRISC resilience scores in veterans with PTSD, these results remained significant after multiple testing correction (P-value = 0.023; r = 0.32). This finding was also replicated in an independent trauma-exposed civilian cohort (P-value = 0.02; r = 0.23). Post-hoc factor analyses revealed that this association was driven by \\\"self-efficacy\\\" items within the CDRISC (P-value = 0.015). These results suggest that among individuals already suffering from PTSD, some aspects of increased resilience might come at a biological cost.",

Imputation of methylation values at low-coverage sites may mitigate these biases while also identifying important genomic features and motifs associated with predictive power.\\n\\nResultsHere we describe BoostMe, a novel method for imputation of DNA methylation within whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data based on a gradient boosting algorithm. Importantly, we designed a new feature that leverages information from multiple samples in the same tissue and disease state, enabling BoostMe to outperform existing imputation methods in speed and accuracy. We show that imputation improves WGBS concordance with the Infinium MethylationEPIC array at low WGBS sequencing depth, suggesting improvement in WGBS accuracy after imputation. Furthermore, we compare the ability of BoostMe and DeepCpG - a deep neural network method - to identify interesting features and motifs associated with methylation in three human tissues implicated in type 2 diabetes (T2D) etiology. We find that while BoostMe only identifies features important to general methylation levels across tissues, DeepCpG is able to learn differences in methylation-associated sequence motifs among different tissues and identify tissue-specific regulators of differentiation such as EBF1 in adipose, ASCL2 in muscle, and FOXA1, TCF12, and NRF1 in islets.

Meaning was captured by \\\"meaning maps\\\" representing the spatial distribution of semantic information in scenes. Meaning maps were coded in a format that could be directly compared to maps of image salience generated from image features. We investigated the degree to which meaning versus image salience predicted human viewers spatial distribution of attention over scenes, with attention operationalized as duration-weighted fixation density. The results showed that both meaning and salience predicted the distribution of attention, but that when the correlation between meaning and salience was statistically controlled, meaning accounted for unique variance in attention but salience did not. This pattern was observed for early as well as late fixations, for fixations following short as well as long saccades, and for fixations including or excluding the centers of the scenes. The results strongly suggest that meaning guides attention in real world scenes. We discuss the results from the perspective of a cognitive relevance theory of attentional guidance in scenes.",
