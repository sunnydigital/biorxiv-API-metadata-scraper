    "abstract": "Many time-resolved, single-molecule biophysics experiments seek to characterize the kinetics of biomolecular systems exhibiting dynamics that challenge the time resolution of the given technique. Here we present a general, computational approach to this problem that employs Bayesian inference to learn the underlying dynamics of such systems, even when they are much faster than the time resolution of the experimental technique being used. By accurately and precisely inferring rate constants, our Bayesian Inference for the Analysis of Sub-temporal-resolution Data (BIASD) approach effectively enables the experimenter to super-resolve the poorly resolved dynamics that are present in their data.",

    "abstract": "The Golgi is the cellular hub for complex glycosylation, controlling accurate processing of complex proteoglycans, receptors, ligands, and glycolipids. Its structure and organisation is dependent on golgins, which tether cisternal membranes and incoming transport vesicles. Here we show that knockout of the largest golgin, giantin, leads to substantial changes in gene expression despite only limited effects on Golgi structure. Notably, 22 Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases, but not glycan processing enzymes or the ER glycosylation machinery, are differentially expressed following giantin ablation. This includes near-complete loss-of-function of GALNT3 in both mammalian cell and zebrafish models. Giantin knockout zebrafish exhibit hyperostosis and ectopic calcium deposits, recapitulating phenotypes of hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis, a disease caused by mutations in GALNT3. These data reveal a new feature of Golgi homeostasis, the ability to regulate glycosyltransferase expression to generate a functional proteoglycome.\\n\\nSummary statementKnockout of giantin in a genome-engineered cell line and zebrafish models reveals the capacity of the Golgi to control its own biochemistry through changes in gene expression.",

We present novel evidence in support of this hypothesis: the analysis of nuclear pseudogenes of mtDNA (\\\"NUMTs\\\"). NUMTs are considered \\\"mtDNA fossils\\\", as they preserve sequences of ancient mtDNA and thus carry unique information about ancestral populations. Our comparison of a NUMT sequence shared by humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas with their mtDNAs implies that, around the time of divergence between humans and chimpanzees, our evolutionary history involved the interbreeding of individuals whose mtDNA had diverged as much as ~4.5 Myr prior. This large divergence suggests a distant interspecies hybridization. Additionally, analysis of two other NUMTs suggests that such events occurred repeatedly. Our findings suggest a complex pattern of speciation in primate human ancestors and provide a potential explanation for the mosaic nature of fossil morphology found at the emergence of the hominin lineage.",

    "abstract": "Trans-translation is a ribosome rescue system that is ubiquitous in bacteria. Small molecules defining a new family of oxadiazole compounds that inhibit trans-translation have been found to have broad-spectrum antibiotic activity. We sought to determine the activity of KKL-35, a potent member of the oxadiazole family, against the human pathogen Legionella pneumophila and other related species that can also cause Legionnaires disease (LD). Consistent with the essential nature of trans-translation in L. pneumophila, KKL-35 inhibits growth of all tested strains at sub-micromolar concentrations. KKL-35 is also active against other LD-causing Legionella species. KKL-35 remains equally active against L. pneumophila mutants that have evolved resistance to macrolides. KKL-35 inhibits multiplication of L. pneumophila in human macrophages at several stages of infection. No resistant mutants could be obtained, even during extended and chronic exposure. Surprisingly, KKL-35 is not synergistic with other ribosome-targeting antibiotics and does not induce the filamentation phenotype observed in cells defective for trans-translation. Importantly, KKL-35 remains active against L. pneumophila mutants expressing an alternate ribosome-rescue system and lacking tmRNA, the essential component of trans-translation. These results indicate that the antibiotic activity of KKL-35 is not related to the specific inhibition of trans-translation and its mode of action remains to be identified. In conclusion, KKL-35 is an effective antibacterial agent against the intracellular pathogen L. pneumophila and with no detectable resistance. However, further studies are needed to better understand its mechanism of action and to assess further the potential of oxadiazoles in treatment.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression variation is extensive in nature, and is hypothesized to play a major role in shaping phenotypic diversity. However, connecting differences in gene expression across individuals to higher-order organismal traits is not trivial. In many cases, gene expression variation may be evolutionarily neutral, and in other cases expression variation may only affect phenotype under specific conditions. To understand connections between gene expression variation and stress defense phenotypes, we have been leveraging extensive natural variation in the gene expression response to acute ethanol in laboratory and wild Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Previous work found that the genetic architecture underlying these expression differences included dozens of \\\"hotspot\\\" loci that affected many transcripts in trans. In the present study, we provide new evidence that one of these expression QTL hotspot loci is responsible for natural variation in one particular stress defense phenotype--ethanol-induced cross protection against severe doses of H2O2. The causative polymorphism is in the heme-activated transcription factor Hap1p, which we show directly impacts cross protection, but not the basal H2O2 resistance of unstressed cells. This provides further support that distinct cellular mechanisms underlie basal and acquired stress resistance. We also show that the Hap1p-dependent cross protection relies on novel regulation of cytosolic catalase T (Ctt1p) during ethanol stress in wild strains. Because ethanol accumulation precedes aerobic respiration and accompanying reactive oxygen species formation, wild strains with the ability to anticipate impending oxidative stress would likely be at an advantage. This study highlights how strategically chosen traits that better correlate with gene expression changes can improve our power to identify novel connections between gene expression variation and higher-order organismal phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal strongyles are the most problematic endoparasites of equids as a result of their wide distribution and the spread of resistant isolates throughout the world. While abundant literature can be found on the extent of anthelmintic resistance across continents, empirical knowledge about associated risk factors is missing. This study brought together results from anthelmintic efficacy testing and risk factor analysis to provide evidence-based guidelines in the field. It involved 688 horses from 39 French horse farms and riding schools to both estimate Faecal Egg Count Reduction (FECR) after anthelmintic treatment and to interview farm and riding school managers about their practices. Risk factors associated with reduced anthelmintic efficacy in equine strongyles were estimated across drugs using a marginal modelling approach. Results demonstrated ivermectin efficacy (96.3% FECR), the inefficacy of fenbendazole (42.8% FECR) and an intermediate profile for pyrantel (90.3% FECR). Risk factor analysis provided support to advocate for FEC-based treatment regimens combined with individual anthelmintic dosage and the enforcement of tighter biosecurity around horse introduction that contributed to lower drug resistance risk by 1.75. Premises falling under this typology also relied more on their veterinarians suggesting they play an important role in the sustainability of anthelmintic usage. Similarly, drug resistance risk was halved in premises with frequent pasture rotation and with stocking rate below five horses/ha. This is the first empirical risk factor analysis for anthelmintic resistance in equids, whose findings should guide the implementation of more sustained strongyle management in the field.",

    "abstract": "There are numerous sources of variation in the rate of synonymous substitutions inside genes, such as direct selection on the nucleotide sequence, or mutation rate variation. Yet scans for positive selection rely on codon models which incorporate an assumption of effectively neutral synonymous substitution rate, constant between sites of each gene. Here we perform a large-scale comparison of approaches which incorporate codon substitution rate variation and propose our own simple yet effective modification of existing models. We find strong effects of substitution rate variation on positive selection inference. More than 70% of the genes detected by the classical branch-site model are presumably false positives caused by the incorrect assumption of uniform synonymous substitution rate. We propose a new model which is strongly favored by the data while remaining computationally tractable. With the new model we can capture signatures of nucleotide level selection acting on translation initiation and on splicing sites within the coding region. Finally, we show that rate variation is highest in the highly recombining regions, and we propose that recombination and mutation rate variation, such as high CpG mutation rate, are the two main sources of nucleotide rate variation. While we detect fewer genes under positive selection in Drosophila than without rate variation, the genes which we detect contain a stronger signal of adaptation of dynein, which could be associated with Wolbachia infection. We provide software to perform positive selection analysis using the new model.",

At the molecular level, cell identity is determined by the coordinated activation and repression of defined sets of genes. Defects in the maintenance of the genetic programs required for identity can have dire consequences such as organ malformation and cancer. The tumor suppressor L(3)mbt was shown to secure cellular identity in Drosophila larval brains by repressing germline-specific genes. Here we interrogate the temporal and spatial requirements for L(3)mbt in the Drosophila ovary, and show that it safeguards the integrity of both somatic and germline tissues. L(3)mbt mutant ovaries exhibit multiple developmental defects, which we find to be largely caused by the inappropriate expression of a single gene, nanos, a key regulator of germline fate, in the somatic cells of the ovary. In the female germline, we find that L(3)mbt represses testis-specific and neuronal genes. Molecularly, we show that L(3)mbt function in the ovary is mediated through its cofactor Lint1 but independent of the dREAM complex. Together, our work uncovers a more complex role for L(3)mbt than previously understood and demonstrates that L(3)mbt secures tissue identity by preventing the simultaneous expression of original identity markers and tissue-specific misexpression signatures.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMolecular profiling of cancers is now routine at many cancer centers, and the number of precision cancer medicine clinical trials, which are informed by profiling, is steadily rising. Additionally, these trials are becoming increasingly complex, often having multiple arms and many genomic eligibility criteria. Currently, it is a challenging for physicians to match patients to relevant clinical trials using the patients genomic profile, which can lead to missed opportunities. Automated matching against uniformly structured and encoded genomic eligibility criteria is essential to keep pace with the complex landscape of precision medicine clinical trials.\\n\\nResultsTo meet these needs, we built and deployed an automated clinical trial matching platform called MatchMiner at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI). The platform has been integrated with Profile, DFCIs enterprise genomic profiling project, which contains tumor profile data for >20,000 patients, and has been made available to physicians across the Institute. As no current standard exists for encoding clinical trial eligibility criteria, a new language called Clinical Trial Markup Language (CTML) was developed, and over 178 genomically-driven clinical trials were encoded using this language. The platform is open source and freely available for adoption by other institutions.\\n\\nConclusionMatchMiner is the first open platform developed to enable computational matching of patient-specific genomic profiles to precision cancer medicine clinical trials. Creating MatchMiner required developing clinical trial eligibility standards to support genome-driven matching and developing intuitive interfaces to support practical use-cases. Given the complexity of tumor profiling and the rapidly changing multi-site nature of genome-driven clinical trials, open source software is the most efficient, scalable, and economical option for matching cancer patients to clinical trials.",

It has been reported that M. tuberculosis H37Rv, a standard reference MTBC strain, is attenuated in cattle compared to Mycobacterium bovis. However, as M. tuberculosis H37Rv was isolated in the early 1930s, and genetic variants are known to exist, we sought to revisit this question of attenuation of M. tuberculosis for cattle by performing a bovine experimental infection with a recent M. tuberculosis isolate. Here we report infection of cattle using M. bovis AF2122/97, M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and M. tuberculosis BTB1558, the latter isolated in 2008 during a TB surveillance project in Ethiopian cattle. We show that both M. tuberculosis strains caused reduced gross and histopathology in cattle compared to M. bovis. Using M. tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis AF2122/97 as the extremes in terms of infection outcome, we used RNA-Seq analysis to explore differences in the peripheral response to infection as a route to identify biomarkers of progressive disease in contrast to a more quiescent, latent infection. Our work shows the attenuation of M. tuberculosis strains for cattle, and emphasizes the potential of the bovine model as a  One Health approach to inform human TB biomarker development and post-exposure vaccine development.",

Fundamental to the analysis of such scRNA-seq data is the ability to cluster similar or same cells into non-overlapping groups. Many competing methods have been proposed for this task, but there is currently little guidance with regards to which method offers most accuracy. Answering this question is complicated by the fact that 10X Genomics data lack cell labels that would allow a direct performance evaluation. Thus in this review, we focused on comparing clustering solutions of a dozen methods for three datasets on human peripheral mononuclear cells generated with the 10X Genomics technology. While clustering solutions appeared robust, we found that solutions produced by different methods have little in common with each other.

In this paper, we present in vivo functional PA (fPA) imaging of chemoconvulsant rat seizure model with intact scalp using a fluorescence quenching-based cyanine voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) characterized by a lipid vesicle model mimicking different levels of membrane potential variation. The framework also involves use of a near-infrared VSD delivered through the blood-brain barrier (BBB), opened by pharmacological modulation of adenosine receptor signaling. Our normalized time-frequency analysis presented in vivo VSD response in the seizure group significantly distinguishable from those of the control groups at sub-mm spatial resolution. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording confirmed the changes of severity and frequency of brain activities, induced by chemoconvulsant seizures of the rat brain. The findings demonstrate that the near-infrared fPA VSD imaging is a promising tool for in vivo recording of brain activities through intact scalp, which would pave a way to its future translation.",

    "abstract": "Although transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has demonstrated short-term effects in modulating neural oscillations, potential clinical efficacy of tACS for treating \\\"oscillopathies\\\" (disorders associated with aberrant neural oscillations) hinges on its ability to generate long-term neural plasticity, which can translate into lasting behavioral changes. Administering alpha-frequency tACS over 4 consecutive days, we evaluated short- and long-term (> 24 hours) effects of -tACS on local alpha power and oscillatory connectivity, along with behavioral outcomes in anxious arousal and affective sensory perception. The -tACS (vs. sham stimulation) group exhibited increases in posterior alpha power immediately and 30 minutes post-stimulation but not 24 hours post-stimulation, suggesting transient effects on local neuronal synchrony. Strikingly, long-range alpha-frequency Granger causal connectivity (posterior[-&gt;]frontal) increased not only immediately and 30 minutes but also 24 hours post-stimulation, paralleled by sustained reductions in anxious arousal and aversion to auditory stimuli. Therefore, tACS is capable of eliciting long-term plasticity in long-range oscillatory connectivity with direct, lasting behavioral consequences, while leaving endogenous local oscillations unaltered. This temporal disparity in local and network effects favors the view of large-scale network strengthening by tACS, calling for research attention to the circuit and network impacts of tACS. Critically, with the growing recognition of large-scale network dysfunctions as a transdiagnostic pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, this connectivity plasticity advocates for the clinical application of tACS with its unique advantage in tackling network pathologies.",

Accurately predicting mortality risk from chemotherapy is important, but few patient data-driven tools exist. We sought to create and validate a machine learning model predicting mortality for patients starting new chemotherapy.\\n\\nMethodsWe obtained electronic health records for patients treated at a large cancer center (26,946 patients; 51,774 new regimens) over 2004-14, linked to Social Security data for date of death. The model was derived using 2004-11 data, and performance measured on non-overlapping 2012-14 data.\\n\\nFindings30-day mortality from chemotherapy start was 2.1%. Common cancers included breast (21.1%), colorectal (19.3%), and lung (18.0%). Model predictions were accurate for all patients (AUC 0.94). Predictions for patients starting palliative chemotherapy (46.6% of regimens), for whom prognosis is particularly important, remained highly accurate (AUC 0.92). To illustrate model discrimination, we ranked patients initiating palliative chemotherapy by model-predicted mortality risk, and calculated observed mortality by risk decile. 30-day mortality in the highest-risk decile was 22.6%; in the lowest-risk decile, no patients died. Predictions remained accurate across all primary cancers, stages, and chemotherapies--even for clinical trial regimens that first appeared in years after the model was trained (AUC 0.94). The model also performed well for prediction of 180-day mortality (AUC 0.87; mortality 74.8% in the highest risk decile vs. 0.2% in the lowest). Predictions were more accurate than data from randomized trials of individual chemotherapies, or SEER estimates.\\n\\nInterpretationA machine learning algorithm accurately predicted short-term mortality in patients starting chemotherapy using EHR data.

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous patterns of genomic differentiation are commonly documented between closely related populations and there is considerable interest in identifying factors that contribute to their formation. These factors could include genomic features (e.g., areas of low recombination) that promote processes like linked selection (positive or purifying selection that affects linked neutral sites) at specific genomic regions. Examinations of repeatable patterns of differentiation across population pairs can provide insight into the role of these factors. Birds are well suited for this work, as genome structure is conserved across this group. Accordingly, we re-estimated relative (FST) and absolute (dXY) differentiation between eight sister pairs of birds that span a broad taxonomic range using a common pipeline. Across pairs, there were modest but significant correlations in window-based estimates of differentiation (up to 3% of variation explained for FST and 26% for dXY), supporting a role for processes at conserved genomic features in generating heterogeneous patterns of differentiation. This suggestion was reinforced by linear models identifying several genomic features (e.g., gene densities) as significant predictors of FST and dXY repeatability. FST repeatability was higher among pairs that were further along the speciation continuum (i.e., more reproductively isolated), suggesting that early stages of speciation may be dominated by positive selection that is different between pairs and replaced by processes acting according to shared genomic features as speciation proceeds.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how neuronal signals propagate in local network is an important step in understanding information processing. As a result, spike trains recorded with Multi-electrode Arrays (MEAs) have been widely used to study behaviors of neural connections. Studying the dynamics of neuronal networks requires the identification of both excitatory and inhibitory connections. The detection of excitatory relationships can robustly be inferred by characterizing the statistical relationships of neural spike trains. However, the identification of inhibitory relationships is more difficult: distinguishing endogenous low firing rates from active inhibition is not obvious. In this paper, we propose an in silico interventional procedure that makes predictions about the effect of stimulating or inhibiting single neurons on other neurons, and thereby gives the ability to accurately identify inhibitory causal relationships. To experimentally test these predictions, we have developed a Neural Circuit Probe (NCP) that delivers drugs transiently and reversibly on individually identified neurons to assess their contributions to the neural circuit behavior. With the help of NCP, three inhibitory connections identified by our in silico modeling were validated through real interventional experiments. Together, these methods provide a basis for mapping complete neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Recent molecular genetic studies have shown that the majority of genes associated with obesity are expressed in the central nervous system. Obesity has also been associated with neurobehavioural factors such as brain morphology, cognitive performance, and personality. Here, we tested whether these neurobehavioural factors were associated with the heritable variance in obesity measured by body mass index (BMI) in the Human Connectome Project (N=895 siblings). Phenotypically, cortical thickness findings supported the \\\"right brain hypothesis\\\" for obesity. Namely, increased BMI associated with decreased cortical thickness in right frontal lobe and increased thickness in the left frontal lobe, notably in lateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, lower thickness and volume in entorhinal-parahippocampal structures, and increased thickness in parietal-occipital structures in obese participants supported the role of visuospatial function in obesity. Brain morphometry results were supported by cognitive tests, which outlined obesitys negative association with visuospatial function, verbal episodic memory, impulsivity, and cognitive flexibility. Personality-obesity correlations were inconsistent. We then aggregated the effects for each neurobehavioural factor for a behavioural genetics analysis and demonstrated the factors genetic overlap with obesity. Namely, cognitive test scores and brain morphometry had 0.25 - 0.45 genetic correlations with obesity, and the phenotypic correlations with obesity were 77-89% explained by genetic factors. Neurobehavioural factors also had some genetic overlap with each other. In summary, obesity has considerable genetic overlap with brain and cognitive measures. This supports the theory that obesity is inherited via brain function, and may inform intervention strategies.\\n\\nSignificance StatementObesity is a widespread heritable health condition. Evidence from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and genetics has proposed links between obesity and the brain. The current study tested whether the heritable variance in obesity is explained by brain and behavioural factors in a large brain imaging cohort that included multiple related individuals. We found that the heritable variance in obesity had genetic correlations 0.25 - 0.45 with cognitive tests, cortical thickness, and regional brain volume. In particular, obesity was associated with frontal lobe asymmetry and differences in temporal-parietal perceptual systems. Further, we found genetic overlap between certain brain and behavioural factors. In summary, the genetic vulnerability to obesity is expressed in the brain. This may inform intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial adaptive immunity utilizes RNA-guided surveillance complexes composed of CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-associated (Cas) proteins together with CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) to target foreign nucleic acids for destruction. Cas9, a type II CRISPR-Cas effector complex, can be programed with a single guide RNA that base-pairs with the target strand of dsDNA, displacing the non-target strand to create an R-loop, where the HNH and RuvC nuclease domains can cleave opposing strands. Cas9 has been repurposed for a variety of important genome engineering applications. While many structural and biochemical studies have shed light on the mechanism of Cas9 cleavage, a clear unifying model has yet to emerge. Our detailed kinetic characterization of the enzyme reveals that DNA binding is reversible, R-loop formation is rate-limiting, occurring in two steps, one for each of the nuclease domains. Although the HNH nuclease activity is stimulated by Mg2+ with a single measureable Kd, the RuvC activity requires two distinct Mg2+ binding events. The specificity constant for cleavage is determined through an induced-fit mechanism as the product of the equilibrium binding affinity for DNA and the rate of R-loop formation.",

    "abstract": "The biconcave disc shape and deformability of mammalian red blood cells (RBCs) relies upon the membrane skeleton, a viscoelastic network of short, membrane-associated actin filaments (F-actin) cross-linked by long, flexible spectrin tetramers. Nonmuscle myosin II (NMII) motors exert force on diverse F-actin networks to control cell shapes, but a function for NMII contractility in the 2D spectrin-F-actin network in RBCs has not been tested. Here, we show that RBCs contain membrane skeleton-associated NMIIA puncta, identified as bipolar filaments by super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. NMIIA association with the membrane skeleton is ATP-dependent, consistent with NMIIA motor domains binding to membrane skeleton F-actin and contributing to membrane mechanical stability. In addition, the NMIIA heavy and light chains are phosphorylated in vivo in RBCs, indicating active regulation of NMIIA motor activity and filament assembly, while reduced heavy chain phosphorylation of membrane skeleton-associated NMIIA indicates assembly of stable filaments at the membrane. Treatment of RBCs with blebbistatin, an inhibitor of NMII motor activity, decreases the number of NMIIA filaments associated with the membrane and enhances local, nanoscale membrane oscillations, suggesting decreased membrane tension. Blebbistatin-treated RBCs also exhibit elongated shapes, loss of membrane curvature, and enhanced deformability, indicating a role for NMIIA contractility in promoting membrane stiffness and maintaining RBC biconcave disc cell shape. As structures similar to the RBC membrane skeleton are conserved in many metazoan cell types, these data demonstrate a general function for NMII in controlling specialized membrane morphology and mechanical properties through contractile interactions with short F-actin in spectrin-F-actin networks.\\n\\nSignificance statementThe biconcave disc shape and deformability of the mammalian RBC is vital to its circulatory function, relying upon a 2D viscoelastic spectrin-F-actin network attached to the membrane. A role for myosin II (NMII) contractility in generating tension in this network and controlling RBC shape has never been tested. We show that NMIIA forms phosphorylated bipolar filaments in RBCs, which associate with F-actin at the membrane. NMIIA motor activity is required for interactions with the spectrin-F-actin network, and regulates RBC biconcave shape and deformability. These results provide a novel mechanism for actomyosin force generation at the plasma membrane, and may be applicable to other cell types such as neurons and polarized epithelial cells with a spectrin-F-actin-based membrane skeleton.",

Here, we introduce an inference scheme that utilizes this signal to detect and estimate the strength of a linear barrier to gene flow in two-dimensions. We use a diffusion approximation to model the effects of a barrier on the geographical spread of ancestry backwards in time. This approach allows us to calculate the chance of recent coalescence and probability of identity by descent. We introduce an inference scheme that fits these theoretical results to the geographical covariance structure of bialleleic genetic markers. It can estimate the strength of the barrier as well as several demographic parameters. We investigate the power of our inference scheme to detect barriers by applying it to a wide range of simulated data. We also showcase an example application to a Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon) flower color hybrid zone, where we do not detect any signal of a strong genome wide barrier to gene flow.",

Based on data from recent exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders, Episcore achieved better performance in prioritizing loss of function de novo variants than current methods. We further showed that Episcore was less biased with gene size, and was complementary to mutation intolerance metrics for prioritizing loss of function variants.

By combining scRNA-seq with computational analysis of lineage barcodes generated by genome editing of transgenic reporter genes, we reconstruct developmental lineage trees in zebrafish larvae and adult fish.

Elucidating the fibril formation mechanism is critical for understanding Huntingtons disease pathology and for developing novel therapeutic strategies. Here, we performed systematic experimental and theoretical studies to examine the self-assembly of an aggregation-prone N-terminal HTT exon-1 fragment with 49 glutamines (Ex1Q49). Using high resolution imaging techniques such as electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy, we show that Ex1Q49 fragments in cell-free assays spontaneously convert into large, highly complex bundles of amyloid fibrils with multiple ends and fibril branching points. Furthermore, we present experimental evidence that two nucleation mechanisms control spontaneous Ex1Q49 fibrillogenesis: (1) a relatively slow primary fibril-independent nucleation process, which involves the spontaneous formation of aggregation-competent fibrillary structures, and (2) a fast secondary fibril-dependent nucleation process, which involves nucleated branching and promotes the rapid assembly of highly complex fibril bundles with multiple ends. The proposed aggregation mechanism is supported by studies with the small molecule O4, which perturbs early events in the aggregation cascade and delays Ex1Q49 fibril assembly, comprehensive mathematical and computational modelling studies, and seeding experiments with small, preformed fibrillar Ex1Q49 aggregates that promote the assembly of amyloid fibrils. Together, our results suggest that nucleated branching in vitro plays a critical role in the formation of complex fibrillar HTT exon-1 aggregates with multiple ends.",

    "abstract": "The Glycoside Hydrolase Family 13 (GH13) is both evolutionary diverse and relevant to many industrial applications. Its members perform the hydrolysis of starch into smaller carbohydrates. Members of the family have been bioengineered to improve catalytic function under industrial environments. We introduce a framework to analyze the response to selection of GH13 protein structures given some phylogenetic and simulated dynamic information. We found that the TIM-barrel is not selectable since it is under purifying selection. We also show a method to rank important residues with higher inferred response to selection. These residues can be altered to effect change in properties. In this work, we define fitness as inferred thermodynamic stability. We show that under the developed framework, residues 112Y, 122K, 124D, 125W, and 126P are good candidates to increase the stability of the truncated protein 4E2O. Overall, this paper demonstrate the feasibility of a framework for the analysis of protein structures for any other fitness landscape.",

TM-JM dimerization plays a crucial role in regulation of EGFR kinase activity at the cytoplasmic side. Although the interaction of JM with membrane lipids is thought to be important to turn on EGF signaling and phosphorylation of Thr654 on JM leads to desensitization, the underlying kinetic mechanisms remain unclear. Especially, how Thr654 phosphorylation regulates EGFR activity is largely unknown. Here, combining single-pair FRET imaging and nanodisc techniques, we showed that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bis phosphate (PIP2) facilitated JM dimerization effectively. We also found that Thr654 phosphorylation dissociated JM dimers in the membranes containing acidic lipids, suggesting that Thr654 phosphorylation electrostatically prevented the interaction with basic residues in JM and acidic lipids. Based on the single-molecule experiment, we clarified the kinetic pathways of monomer (inactive state) - dimer (active state) transition of JM domains and alteration in the pathways depending on the membrane lipid species and Thr654 phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "Kinesin motors play central roles in bipolar spindle assembly. In many eukaryotes, spindle pole separation is driven by Kinesin-5 that generates outward force. This outward force is balanced by antagonistic inward force elicited by Kinesin-14 and/or Dynein. In fission yeast, two Kinesin-14s, Pkl1 and Klp2, play an opposing role against Kinesin-5/Cut7. However, how these two Kinesin-14s coordinate individual activities remains elusive. Here we show that while deletion of either pkl1 or klp2 rescues temperature sensitive cut7 mutants, only pkl1 deletion can bypass the lethality caused by cut7 deletion. Pkl1 is tethered to the spindle pole body, while Klp2 is localized along the spindle microtubule. Forced targeting of Klp2 to the spindle pole body, however, compensates for Pkl1 functions, indicating that cellular localizations, rather than individual motor specificities, differentiate between the two Kinesin-14s. Interestingly, human Kinesin-14/HSET can replace either Pkl1 or Klp2. Moreover, overproducing HSET induces monopolar spindles, reminiscent of the phenotype of Cut7 inactivation. Taken together, this study has uncovered the biological mechanism of how two different Kinesin-14s exert their antagonistic roles against Kinesin-5 in a spatially distinct manner.\\n\\nSUMMARY STATEMENTProper force-balance generated by Kinesin-5 and Kinesin-14 is crucial for spindle bipolarity. Two fission yeast Kinesin-14s localize to different structures, thereby collaboratively producing inward forces against Kinesin-5-mediated outward force.\\n\\nAbbreviations used",

    "abstract": "Tissue elongation and its control by spatiotemporal signals is a major developmental question. Currently, it is thought that Drosophila ovarian follicular epithelium elongation requires the planar polarization of the basal domain cytoskeleton and of the extra-cellular matrix, associated with a dynamic process of rotation around the anteroposterior axis. Here we show, by careful kinetic analysis of fat2 mutants, that neither basal planar polarization nor rotation is required during a first phase of follicle elongation. Conversely, a JAK-STAT signaling gradient from each follicle pole orients early elongation. JAK-STAT controls apical pulsatile contractions, and Myosin II activity inhibition affects both pulses and early elongation. Early elongation is associated with apical constriction at the poles and oriented cell rearrangements, but without any visible planar cell polarization of the apical domain. Thus, a morphogen gradient can trigger tissue elongation via a control of cell pulsing and without planar cell polarity requirement.\\n\\nImpact StatementFollicle elongation does not rely solely on the basal side of the cells but also requires a mechanism integrating a developmental cue with a morphogenetic process involving their apical domain.",

However, the evolutionary processes that sculpt antibody repertoires remain poorly understood. Here, using an unbiased repertoire-scale approach, we show that the molecular signatures of evolution are evident in human B cell lineages and reveal how antibodies evolve somatically. We measured the dynamics and genetic diversity of B cell responses of five adults longitudinally before and after influenza vaccination using high-throughput antibody repertoire sequencing. We identified vaccine-responsive B cell lineages that carry signatures of selective sweeps driven by positive selection, and discovered that they often display evidence for selective sweeps favoring multiple subclones. We also found persistent B cell lineages that exhibit stable population dynamics and carry signatures of neutral drift. By exploiting the linkage between B cell fitness and antibody binding affinity, we demonstrated the potential for using signatures of selection to identify antibodies with high binding affinity. This quantitative characterization reveals that antibody repertoires are shaped by an unexpectedly broad spectrum of evolutionary processes and shows how signatures of evolutionary history can be harnessed for antibody discovery and engineering.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryMolecular signatures of somatic evolution reveal that diverse evolutionary processes ranging from strong positive selection to neutral drift sculpt human antibodies.",

    "abstract": "We internally represent the structure of our surroundings even when there is little layout information available in the visual image, such as when walking through fog or darkness. One way in which we disambiguate such scenes is through object cues; for example, seeing a boat supports the inference that the foggy scene is a lake. Recent studies have investigated the neural mechanisms by which object and scene processing interact to support object perception. The current study examines the reverse interaction, by which objects facilitate the neural representation of scene layout. Photographs of indoor (closed) and outdoor (open) real-world scenes were blurred such that they were difficult to categorize on their own, but easily disambiguated by the inclusion of an object. fMRI decoding was used to measure scene representations in scene-selective parahippocampal place area (PPA) and occipital place area (OPA). Classifiers were trained to distinguish response patterns to fully visible indoor and outdoor scenes, presented in an independent experiment. Testing these classifiers on blurred scenes revealed a strong improvement in classification in left PPA and OPA when objects were present, despite the reduced low-level visual feature overlap with the training set in this condition. These findings were specific to left PPA/OPA, with no evidence for object-driven facilitation in right PPA/OPA, object-selective areas, and early visual cortex. These findings demonstrate separate roles for left and right scene-selective cortex in scene representation, whereby left PPA/OPA represents inferred scene layout, influenced by contextual object cues, and right PPA/OPA represents a scenes visual features.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian cerebral neocortex has a unique structure, composed of layers of different neuron types, interconnected in a stereotyped fashion. While the overall developmental program seems to be conserved, there are divergent developmental factors generating cortical diversity amongst mammalian species. In terms of cortical neuronal numbers some of the determining factors are the size of the founder population, the duration of cortical neurogenesis, the proportion of different progenitor types, and the fine-tuned balance between self-renewing and differentiative divisions. We develop a mathematical model of neurogenesis that, accounting for these factors, aims at explaining the high diversity in neuronal numbers found across mammalian species. By framing our hypotheses in rigorous mathematical terms, we are able to identify paths of neurogenesis that match experimentally observed patterns in mouse, macaque and human. Additionally, we use our model to identify key parameters that would particularly benefit from accurate experimental investigation. We find that the timing of a switch in favor of symmetric neurogenic divisions produces the highest variation in cortical neuronal numbers. Surprisingly, in our model the increase in cortical neuronal numbers does not necessarily reflect a larger size of founder population, a prediction that identified a specific need for experimental quantifications.",

The recent discovery of \\\"color patches\\\" in macaque inferotemporal (IT) cortex, the part of brain responsible for object recognition, makes this problem experimentally tractable. Here we record neurons in three color patches, middle color patch CLC (central lateral color patch), and two anterior color patches ALC (anterior lateral color patch) and AMC (anterior medial color patch), while presenting images of objects systematically varied in hue. We found that all three patches contain high concentrations of hue-selective cells, and the three patches use distinct computational strategies to represent colored objects: while all three patches multiplex hue and shape information, shape-invariant hue information is much stronger in anterior color patches ALC/AMC than CLC; furthermore, hue and object shape specifically for primate faces/bodies are over-represented in AMC but not in the other two patches.",

In pairwise analyses, differences in MVPA amount were seen only among twin pairs who were discordant at baseline for smoking (n=40 pairs, median follow-up MVPA 25 vs. 35 min, P=.037) or for health status (n=69 pairs, 30 vs. 44 min, P=.014). For smoking, the difference in MVPA also was seen for monozygotic pairs, but for health status, it was seen only for dizygotic pairs. Mediation analysis showed that shared genetic factors explained 82% of the correlation between LT-mMET and MVPA.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCELow leisure-time physical activity at younger age, overweight, smoking, low socioeconomic status, and health problems predicted low MVPA in old age in individual-based analyses. However, based on the pairwise analyses and quantitative trait modeling, genetic factors and smoking seem to be important determinants of later-life MVPA.",

    "abstract": "Evidence is mounting that influenza virus, a major contributor to the global disease burden, interacts with other pathogens infecting the human respiratory tract. Taking into account interactions with other pathogens may be critical to determining the real influenza burden and the full impact of public health policies targeting influenza. That necessity is particularly true for mathematical modeling studies, which have become critical in public health decision-making, despite their usually focusing on lone influenza virus acquisition and infection, thereby making broad oversimplifications regarding pathogen ecology. Herein, we review evidence of influenza virus interaction with bacteria and viruses, and the modeling studies that incorporated some of these. Despite the many studies examining possible associations between influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitides, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinoviruses, human parainfluenza viruses, etc., very few mathematical models have integrated other pathogens alongside influenza. A notable exception is the recent modeling of the pneumococcus-influenza interaction, which highlighted potential influenza-related increased pneumococcal transmission and pathogenicity. That example demonstrates the power of dynamic modeling as an approach to test biological hypotheses concerning interaction mechanisms and estimate the strength of those interactions. We explore how different interference mechanisms may lead to unexpected incidence trends and misinterpretations. Using simple transmission models, we illustrate how existing interactions might impact public health surveillance systems and demonstrate that the development of multipathogen models is essential to assess the true public health burden of influenza, and help improve planning and evaluation of control measures. Finally, we identify the public health needs, surveillance, modeling and biological challenges, and propose avenues of research for the coming years.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryInfluenza is a major pathogen responsible for important morbidity and mortality burdens worldwide. Mathematical models of influenza virus acquisition have been critical to understanding its epidemiology and planning public health strategies of infection control. It is increasingly clear that microbes do not act in isolation but potentially interact within the host. Hence, studying influenza alone may lead to masking effects or misunderstanding information on its transmission and severity. Herein, we review the literature on bacterial and viral species that interact with the influenza virus, interaction mechanisms, and mathematical modeling studies integrating interactions. We report evidence that, beyond the classic secondary bacterial infections, many pathogenic bacteria and viruses probably interact with influenza. Public health relevance of pathogen interactions is detailed, showing how potential misreading or a narrow outlook might lead to mistaken public health decisionmaking. We describe the role of mechanistic transmission models in investigating this complex system and obtaining insight into interactions between influenza and other pathogens. Finally, we highlight benefits and challenges in modeling, and speculate on new opportunities made possible by taking a broader view: including basic science, clinical relevance and public health.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 based gene activation (CRISPRa) is an attractive tool for cellular reprogramming applications due to its high multiplexing capacity and direct targeting of endogenous loci. Here we present the reprogramming of primary human skin fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) using CRISPRa, targeting endogenous OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, MYC and LIN28A promoters. The basal reprogramming efficiency can be improved by an order of magnitude by additionally targeting a conserved Alu-motif, enriched near genes involved in embryo genome activation (EEA-motif). This effect is mediated in part by more efficient activation of NANOG and REX1. These data constitute a proof of principle that somatic cells can be reprogrammed into iPSC using only CRISPRa. Furthermore, the results unravel previously uncharacterized involvement of EEA-motif-associated mechanisms in cellular reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "In addition to sharing with condensin an ability to organize DNA into chromatids, cohesin regulates enhancer-promoter interactions and confers sister chromatid cohesion. Association with chromosomes is regulated by hook-shaped HEAT repeat proteins that Associate With its Kleisin (Scc1) subunit (HAWKs), namely Scc3, Pds5, and Scc2. Unlike Pds5, Scc2 is not a stable cohesin constituent but, as shown here, transiently displaces Pds5 during loading. Scc1 mutations that compromise its interaction with Scc2 adversely affect cohesins ATPase activity, loading, and translocation while Scc2 mutations that alter how the ATPase responds to DNA abolish loading despite cohesins initial association with loading sites. Lastly, Scc2 mutations that permit loading in the absence of Scc4 increase Scc2s association with chromosomal cohesin and reduce that of Pds5. We suggest that cohesin switches between two states, one with Pds5 bound to Scc1 that is not able to hydrolyse ATP efficiently but is capable of release from chromosomes and another in which Scc2, transiently replacing Pds5, stimulates the ATP hydrolysis necessary for loading and translocation away from loading sites.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAn excessive pulmonary inflammatory response could explain the poor prognosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients submitted to invasive mechanical ventilation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to normal tidal volume (Vt) mechanical ventilation in a murine model of pulmonary emphysema, which represents the alveolar component of COPD. In this model, two time points associated with different levels of lung inflammation but similar lung destruction, were analyzed.\\n\\nMethodsC57BL/6 mice received a tracheal instillation of 5 IU of porcine pancreatic elastase (Elastase mice) or the same volume of saline (Saline mice). Fourteen (D14) and 21 (D21) days after instillation, mice were anesthetized, intubated, and either mechanically ventilated (MV) with a normal Vt (8 mL/kg) or maintained on spontaneous ventilation (SV) during two hours. We analyzed respiratory mechanics, emphysema degree (mean chord length by lung histological analysis), and lung inflammation (bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellularity, proportion and activation of total lung inflammatory cells by flow cytometry).\\n\\nResultsAs compared with Saline mice, Elastase mice showed a similarly increased mean chord length and pulmonary compliance at D14 and D21, while BAL cellularity was comparable between groups. Lung mechanics was similarly altered during mechanical ventilation in Elastase and Saline mice. Activated alveolar macrophages CD11bmid were present in lung parenchyma in both Elastase SV mice and Elastase MV mice at D14 but were absent at D21 and in Saline mice, indicating an inflammatory state with elastase at D14 only. At D14, Elastase MV mice showed a significant increase in percentage of neutrophils concomitant with a decrease in percentage of alveolar macrophages in total lung, as compared with Elastase SV mice. Furthermore, alveolar macrophages of Elastase MV mice at D14 overexpressed Gr1, and monocytes showed a trend to overexpression of CD62L, compared with Elastase SV mice.\\n\\nConclusionsIn an elastase-induced model of pulmonary emphysema, normal Vt mechanical ventilation produced an increase in the proportion of pulmonary neutrophils, and an activation of alveolar macrophages and pulmonary monocytes. This response was observed only when the emphysema model showed an underlying inflammation (D14), reflected by the presence of activated alveolar macrophages CD11bmid.",

    "abstract": "The RNA-binding protein HuD promotes neurogenesis and favors recovery from peripheral axon injury. HuD interacts with many mRNAs, altering both stability and translation efficiency. UV-crosslinking and analysis of cDNA (CRAC) generated a nucleotide resolution map of the HuD RNA interactome in motor neuron-like cells. HuD target sites were identified in 1304 mRNAs, predominantly in the 3UTR, with enrichment for genes involved in protein synthesis and axonogenesis. HuD bound many mRNAs encoding mTORC1-responsive ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Altered HuD expression correlated with the translational efficiency of these mRNAs and overall protein synthesis, in a mTORC1-independent fashion. The predominant HuD target was the abundant, small non-coding RNA Y3, which represented 70% of HuD interaction signal. Y3 functions as a molecular sponge for HuD, dynamically limiting its activity. These findings uncover an alternative route to the mTORC1 pathway for translational control in motor neurons that is tunable by a small non-coding RNA.\\n\\nGraphical abstract\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/205658_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (69K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b2d21org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cfdc8borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1984f88org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8da1ee_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here we report a technology, scGESTALT, which combines cell type identification by single-cell RNA sequencing with lineage recording by cumulative barcode editing. We sequenced ~60,000 transcriptomes from the juvenile zebrafish brain and identified more than 100 cell types and marker genes. We engineered an inducible system that combines early and late barcode editing and isolated thousands of single-cell transcriptomes and their associated barcodes. The large diversity of edited barcodes and cell types enabled the generation of lineage trees with hundreds of branches. Inspection of lineage trajectories identified restrictions at the level of cell types and brain regions and helped uncover gene expression cascades during differentiation. These results establish scGESTALT as a new and widely applicable tool to simultaneously characterize the molecular identities and lineage histories of thousands of cells during development and disease.",

The molecular mechanism by which the kinesins depolymerize microtubules and are adapted to perform a seemingly very different activity from other kinesins is still unclear. To address this issue we obtained near atomic resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Drosophila melanogaster kinesin-13 KLP10A constructs bound to curved or straight tubulin in different nucleotide states. The structures show how nucleotide induced conformational changes near the catalytic site are coupled with kinesin-13-specific structural elements to induce tubulin curvature leading to microtubule depolymerization. The data highlight a modular structure that allows similar kinesin core motor-domains to be used for different functions, such as motility or microtubule depolymerization.",

The complexity of natural environments and the large number of niches present in most habitats are often invoked to explain the maintenance of microbial diversity in the presence of competitive exclusion. Here we show that soil and plant-associated microbiota, cultivated ex situ in minimal synthetic environments with a single supplied source of carbon, universally re-assemble into large and dynamically stable communities with strikingly predictable coarse-grained taxonomic and functional compositions. We find that generic, non-specific metabolic cross-feeding leads to the assembly of dense facilitation networks that enable the coexistence of multiple competitors for the supplied carbon source. The inclusion of universal and non-specific cross-feeding in ecological consumer-resource models is sufficient to explain our observations, and predicts a simple determinism in community structure, a property reflected in our experiments.",

The adaptively significant electric organ discharge behavior of weakly electric fish is the direct result of biophysical membrane properties set by ion channels. Here we describe a voltage-gated potassium channel gene in African mormyrid electric fishes, that is under positive selection and highly expressed in the electric organ. The channel produced by this gene shortens electric organ action potentials by activating quickly and at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Surprisingly, the source of these unique properties is a derived patch of negatively charged amino acids in an extracellular loop near the voltage sensor. Further, we demonstrate that this portion of the channel functions differently in vertebrates than the generally accepted model based on the shaker channel, and suggest a role for this loop in the evolutionary tuning of voltage-dependent channels.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin folding is increasingly recognized as a regulator of genomic processes such as gene activity. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) methods have been developed to unravel genome topology through the analysis of pair-wise chromatin contacts and have identified many genes and regulatory sequences that, in populations of cells, are engaged in multiple DNA interactions. However, pair-wise methods cannot discern whether contacts occur simultaneously or in competition on the individual chromosome. We present a novel 3C method, Multi-Contact 4C (MC-4C), that applies Nanopore sequencing to study multi-way DNA conformations of tens of thousands individual alleles for distinction between cooperative, random and competing interactions. MC-4C can uncover previously missed structures in sub-populations of cells. It reveals unanticipated cooperative clustering between regulatory chromatin loops, anchored by enhancers and gene promoters, and CTCF and cohesin-bound architectural loops. For example, we show that the constituents of the active b-globin super-enhancer cooperatively form an enhancer hub that can host two genes at a time. We also find cooperative interactions between further dispersed regulatory sequences of the active proto-cadherin locus. When applied to CTCF-bound domain boundaries, we find evidence that chromatin loops can collide, a process that is negatively regulated by the cohesin release factor WAPL. Loop collision is further pronounced in WAPL knockout cells, suggestive of a \\\"cohesin traffic jam\\\". In summary, single molecule multi-contact analysis methods can reveal how the myriad of regulatory sequences spatially coordinate their actions on individual chromosomes. Insight into these single allele higher-order topological features will facilitate interpreting the consequences of natural and induced genetic variation and help uncovering the mechanisms shaping our genome.",

R. irregularis has only ten or eleven copies of complete 45S rDNAs, whereas the general eukaryotic genome has tens to thousands of rDNA copies. R. irregularis rDNAs are highly heterogeneous and lack a tandem repeat structure. These findings provide evidence for the hypothesis that rDNA heterogeneity depends on the lack of tandem repeat structures. RNA-Seq analysis confirmed that all rDNA variants are actively transcribed.

    "abstract": "Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is one of the most common and lethal birth defects. Previous studies using exome sequencing support a significant contribution of coding de novo variants in complex CDH cases with additional anomalies and likely gene-disrupting (LGD) variants in isolated CDH cases. To further investigate the genetic architecture of CDH, we performed exome or genome sequencing in 283 proband-parent trios. Combined with data from previous studies, we analyzed a total of 357 trios, including 148 complex and 209 isolated cases. Complex and isolated cases both have a significant burden of deleterious de novo coding variants (1.7~fold, p= 1.2x10-5 for complex, 1.5~fold, p= 9.0x10-5 for isolated). Strikingly, in isolated CDH, almost all of the burden is carried by female cases (2.1~fold, p=0.004 for likely gene disrupting and 1.8~fold, p= 0.0008 for damaging missense variants); whereas in complex CDH, the burden is similar in females and males. Additionally, de novo LGD variants in complex cases are mostly enriched in genes highly expressed in developing diaphragm, but distributed in genes with a broad range of expression levels in isolated cases. Finally, we identified a new candidate risk gene MYRF (4 de novo variants, p-value=2x10-10), a transcription factor intolerant of mutations. Patients with MYRF mutations have additional anomalies including congenital heart disease and genitourinary defects, likely representing a novel syndrome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMosquito-borne flaviviruses causing diseases such as dengue and Japanese encephalitis are devastating, particularly in the tropics. Although, multiple flaviviruses are known to co-circulate in India, when a patient presents with febrile illness, testing is usually limited to specific pathogens. Unbiased metagenomic sequencing of febrile cases can reveal the presence of multiple pathogens and provide complete genome information. Sequence information, a cornerstone for tracing virus evolution, is relevant for the design of vaccines and therapeutics. In order to assess the usefulness of unbiased metagenomic sequencing for the identification of viruses associated with febrile illness, we sequenced serum from four individuals and plasma from one individual, all hospitalized at a tertiary care centre in South India with severe or prolonged febrile illnesses, together with one healthy control in 2014.\\n\\nResultsWe identified and assembled a complete dengue virus type 3 (DENV3) sequence from the serum of a case classified as severe dengue. We also found a small number of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) sequences in the serum of two adults with febrile illness, including the one who had dengue. Phylogenetic analysis of the dengue sequence indicates that it belongs to a predominantly Asian, DENV3, genotype III clade. It had an estimated divergence time of 13.86 years (95% Highest Posterior Densities 12.94 - 14.83 years) with the closest Indian strain. Amino acid substitutions were present throughout the sequenced genome, including 11 substitutions in the antigenic envelope protein compared to the strain used for the development of the first commercial dengue vaccine. Of these one substitution (E361D) was unique and six were in critical antigenic sites.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that both genome assembly and detection of a low number of viral sequences are possible by unbiased sequencing of clinical material. Complete dengue virus sequence analysis places the sequenced genome in a recent, predominantly Asian clade within genotype III of DENV3. The detection of JEV, an agent not routinely tested in febrile illness in India, warrants further analysis and highlights the need to study co-circulating flaviviruses in parallel.",

To address mechanisms behind the mucus accumulation, the elastase-induced mouse model was utilized. The proteomes of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from elastase-induced mice and COPD patients showed similarities to each other and to colonic mucus. Lung mucus showed a striated, laminated appearance in the elastase-induced mice, COPD and CF, resembling that observed for colonic mucus. Less mucus obstruction was observed in mice lacking the Muc5b mucin. The accumulated mucus plugs of the elastase-induced mice were possible to wash out, but a mucus layer covering the epithelium remained attached to the surface goblet cells also after hypertonic saline washings as widely used in CF therapy.

    "abstract": "Plants respond to pathogens through dynamic regulation of plasma membrane-bound signaling pathways. To date, how the plant plasma membrane is involved in responses to viruses is mostly unknown. Here, we show that plant cells sense the Potato virus X (PVX) COAT PROTEIN and TRIPLE GENE BLOCK 1 proteins and subsequently trigger the activation of a membrane-bound calcium-dependent kinase. We show that the Arabidopsis thaliana CALCIUM-DEPENDENT PROTEIN KINASE 3-interacts with group 1 REMORINs in vivo, phosphorylates the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain of the Group 1 REMORIN REM1.3, and restricts PVX cell-to-cell movement. REM1.3-s phospho-status defines its plasma membrane nanodomain organization and is crucial for REM1.3-dependent restriction of PVX cell-to-cell movement by regulation of callose deposition at plasmodesmata. This study unveils plasma membrane nanodomain-associated molecular events underlying the plant immune response to viruses.",

    "abstract": "Bioinformatics, a discipline that combines aspects of biology, statistics, and computer science, is increasingly important for biological research. However, bioinformatics instruction is rarely integrated into life sciences curricula at the undergraduate level. To understand why, the Network for Integrating Bioinformatics into Life Sciences Education (NIBLSE, \\\"nibbles\\\") recently undertook an extensive survey of life sciences faculty in the United States. The survey responses to open-ended questions about barriers to integration were subjected to keyword analysis. The barrier most frequently reported by the ~1,260 respondents was lack of faculty training. Faculty at associates-granting institutions report the least training in bioinformatics and the least integration of bioinformatics into their teaching. Faculty from underrepresented minority groups (URMs) in STEM reported training barriers at a higher rate than others, although the number of URM respondents was small. Interestingly, the cohort of faculty with the most recently awarded PhD degrees reported the most training but were teaching bioinformatics at a lower rate than faculty who earned their degrees in previous decades. Other barriers reported included lack of student interest in bioinformatics; lack of student preparation in mathematics, statistics, and computer science; already overly full curricula; and limited access to resources, including hardware, software, and vetted teaching materials. The results of the survey, the largest to date on bioinformatics education, will guide efforts to further integrate bioinformatics instruction into undergraduate life sciences education.",

Briefly, CRISPR-Cas9 ribonucleoproteins (crRNPs) are synthesized in vitro and delivered to activated primary human CD4+ T cells by nucleofection. These edited cells are then validated and expanded for use in downstream cellular, genetic, or protein-based assays. Our platform supports the arrayed generation of several gene manipulations in only a few hours time and is widely adaptable across culture conditions, infection protocols, and downstream applications. We present detailed protocols for crRNP synthesis, primary T cell culture, 96-well nucleofection, molecular validation, and HIV infection with additional considerations for guide and screen design as well as crRNP multiplexing.",

However, some TFs can bind to two distinct sequences that represent two local optima in the Gibbs free energy of binding ({Delta}G). To determine the molecular mechanism behind this effect, we solved the structures of human HOXB13 and CDX2 bound to their two optimal DNA sequences, CAATAAA and TCGTAAA. Thermodynamic analyses by isothermal titration calorimetry revealed that both sites were bound with similar {Delta}G. However, the interaction with the CAA sequence was driven by change in enthalpy ({Delta}H), whereas the TCG site was bound with similar affinity due to smaller loss of entropy ({Delta}S). The common presence of at least two local optima is general to all macromolecular interactions, as {Delta}G depends on two partially independent variables {Delta}H and {Delta}S according to the central equation of thermodynamics, {Delta}G = {Delta}H - T{Delta}S.",

Here we characterise lentivirus-based bi-cistronic reporter gene vectors and silica-coated gold nanorods (GNRs) as synergistic tools for cell labelling and tracking. Co-expression of the bioluminescence reporter luciferase and the optoacoustic reporter near-infrared fluorescent protein iRFP720 enabled cell tracking over time in mice. Multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) showed immediate biodistribution of GNR-labelled cells after intracardiac injection and successive clearance of GNRs (day 1-15) with high resolution, while optoacoustic iRFP720 detection indicated tumour growth (day 10-40).

Measures of genomic variation integrated with EHRs offer a potential strategy to accurately stratify patients for risk profiling and discover new relationships between diagnoses and genomes. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) for common cancers are associated with multiple phenotypes in a Phenome-wide Association Study (PheWAS) conducted in 28,260 unrelated, genotyped patients of recent European ancestry who consented to participate in the Michigan Genomics Initiative, a longitudinal biorepository effort within Michigan Medicine. PRS for 12 cancer traits were calculated using summary statistics from the NHGRI-EBI catalog. A total of 1,711 synthetic case-control studies was used for PheWAS analyses. There were 13,490 (47.7%) patients with at least one cancer diagnosis in this study sample. PRSs exhibited strong association for several cancer traits they were designed for including female breast cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and thyroid cancer. Phenome-wide significant associations were observed between PRS and many non-cancer diagnoses. To differentiate PRS associations driven by the primary trait from associations arising through shared genetic risk profiles, the idea of \\\"exclusion PRS PheWAS\\\" was introduced. This approach led to phenome-wide significant associations between a lower risk for hypothyroidism in patients with high thyroid cancer PRS and a higher risk for actinic keratosis in patients with high squamous cell carcinoma PRS after removing all cases of the primary cancer trait. Further analysis of temporal order of the diagnoses improved our understanding of these secondary associations. This is the first comprehensive PheWAS study using PRS instead of a single variant.",

    "abstract": "Nocturnally active birds roosting in exposed diurnal microsites with intense solar radiation can experience operative temperatures (Te) that markedly differ from air temperature (Ta). Quantifying Te thus becomes important for accurately modeling energy and water balance. We measured Te at roost and nest sites used by Rufous-cheeked Nightjars (Caprimulgus rufigena) with three-dimensionally printed biophysical models covered with the integument and plumage of a bird. Additionally, we estimated site-specific diurnal water requirements for evaporative cooling by integrating Te and Ta profiles with evaporative water loss (EWL) data for Rufous-cheeked Nightjars. Between 12:00 and 15:00 hrs, average Te at roost sites varied from 33.1 to 49.9 {degrees}C, whereas at the single nest site Te averaged 51.4 {degrees}C. Average diurnal EWL, estimated using Te, was as high as 10.5 and 11.3 g at roost and nest sites, respectively, estimates 3.8- and 4.0-fold greater, respectively, than when calculated with Ta profiles. These data illustrate that under current climatic conditions, Rufous-cheeked Nightjars can experience EWL potentially approaching their limits of dehydration tolerance. In the absence of microsite changes, climate change during the 21st century could perhaps create thermal conditions under which Rufous-cheeked Nightjars exceed dehydration tolerance limits before the onset of their nocturnal active phase.",

    "abstract": "Molecular ecologists frequently use genome reduction strategies that rely upon restriction enzyme digestion of genomic DNA to sample consistent portions of the genome from many individuals (e.g., RADseq, GBS). However, researchers often find the existing methods expensive to initiate and/or difficult to implement consistently, especially due to the inability to highly-multiplex samples to fill entire sequencing lanes. Here, we introduce a low-cost and highly robust approach for the construction of dual-digest RADseq libraries that relies on adapters and primers designed in Adapterama I. Major features of our method include: 1) minimizing the number of processing steps; 2) focusing on a single strand of sample DNA for library construction, allowing the use of a non-phosphorylated adapter on one end; 3) ligating adapters in the presence of active restriction enzymes, thereby reducing chimeras; 4) including an optional third restriction enzyme to cut apart adapter-dimers formed by the phosphorylated adapter, thus increasing the efficiency of adapter ligation to sample DNA, which is particularly effective when only low quantity/quality DNA samples are available; 5) interchangeable adapter designs; 6) incorporating variable-length internal indexes within the adapters to increase the scope of sample indexing, facilitate pooling, and increase sequence diversity; 7) maintaining compatibility with universal dual-indexed primers and thus, Illumina sequencing reagents and libraries; and, 8) easy modification for the identification of PCR duplicates. We present eight adapter designs that work with 72 restriction enzyme combinations. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by comparing it with existing methods, and we validate its utility through the discovery of many variable loci in a variety of non-model organisms. Our 2RAD/3RAD method is easy to perform, has low startup costs, has increased utility with low-concentration input DNA, and produces libraries that can be highly-multiplexed and pooled with other Illumina libraries.",

To determine which factors, including selective antibiotic pressure, govern the expansion of two major lineages of CA-MRSA, namely \\\"USA300\\\" in Northern America and the \\\"European ST80\\\" in North Africa, Europe and the Middle East, we explored virulence factor expression, and fitness levels with or without antibiotics. The sampled strains were collected in a temporal window representing various steps of the epidemics, reflecting predicted effective population size as inferred from whole genome analysis. In addition to slight variations in virulence factor expression and biofilm production that might influence the ecological niches of theses lineages, competitive fitness experiments revealed that the biological cost of resistance to methicillin, fusidic-acid and fluoroquinolone is totally reversed in the presence of trace amount of antibiotics. Our results suggest that low-level antibiotics exposure in human and animal environments contributed to the expansion of both European-ST80 and USA300 lineages in community setting. This surge was likely driven by antibiotic (ab)use promoting the accumulation of antibiotics as environmental pollutants. The current results provide a novel link between effective population size increase of a pathogen and a selective advantage conferred by antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Mock communities have been used in microbiome method development to help estimate biases introduced in PCR amplification, sequencing, and to optimize pipeline outputs. Nevertheless, the necessity of routine mock community analysis beyond initial method development is rarely, if ever, considered. Here we report that our routine use of mock communities as internal standards allowed us to discover highly aberrant and strong biases in the relative proportions of multiple taxa in a single Illumina HiSeqPE250 run. In this run, an important archaeal taxon virtually disappeared from all samples, and other mock community taxa showed >2-fold high or low abundance, whereas a rerun of those identical amplicons (from the same reaction tubes) on a different date yielded \\\"normal\\\" results. Although obvious from the strange mock community results, due to natural variation of microbiomes at our site, we easily could have missed the problem had we not used the mock communities. The \\\"normal\\\" results were validated over 4 MiSeqPE300 runs and 3 HiSeqPE250 runs, and run-to-run variation was usually low (Bray-Curtis distance was 0.12{+/-}0.04). While validating these \\\"normal\\\" results, we also discovered some mock microbial taxa had relatively modest, but consistent, differences between sequencing platforms. We suggest that using mock communities in every sequencing run is essential to distinguish potentially serious aberrations from natural variations. Such mock communities should have more than just a few members and ideally at least partly represent the samples being analyzed, to detect problems that show up only in some taxa, as we observed.\\n\\nImportanceDespite the routine use of standards and blanks in virtually all chemical or physical assays and most biological studies (a kind of \\\"control\\\"), microbiome analysis has traditionally lacked such standards. Here we show that unexpected problems of unknown origin can occur in such sequencing runs, and yield completely incorrect results that would not necessarily be detected without the use of standards. Assuming that the microbiome sequencing analysis works properly every time risks serious errors that can be avoided by the use of suitable mock communities.",

    "abstract": "Auditory signals arrive at the ear as a mixture that the brain must decompose into distinct sources, based to a large extent on acoustic properties of the sounds. An important question concerns whether listeners have voluntary control over how many sources they perceive. This has been studied using pure tones H and L presented in the repeating pattern HLH-HLH-, which can form a bistable percept, heard either as an integrated whole (HLH-) or as segregated into high (H-H-) and low (-L--) sequences. Although instructing listeners to try to integrate or segregate sounds affects reports of what they hear, this could reflect a response bias rather than a perceptual effect. We had human listeners (15 males, 12 females) continuously report their perception of such sequences and recorded neural activity using magneto-encephalography. During neutral listening, a classifier trained on patterns of neural activity distinguished between periods of integrated and segregated perception. In other conditions, participants tried to influence their perception by allocating attention either to the whole sequence, or to a subset of the sounds. They reported hearing the desired percept for a greater proportion of time than when listening neutrally. Critically, neural activity supported these reports; stimulus-locked brain responses in auditory cortex were more likely to resemble the signature of segregation when participants tried to hear segregation than when attempting to perceive integration. These results indicate that listeners can influence how many sound sources they perceive, as reflected in neural responses that track both the input and its perceptual organization.\\n\\nSignificance StatementCan we consciously influence our perception of the external world? We address this question using sound sequences that can be heard either as coming from a single source, or as two distinct auditory streams. Listeners reported spontaneous changes in their perception between these two interpretations while we recorded neural activity to identify signatures of such integration and segregation. They also indicated that they could, to some extent, choose between these alternatives. This claim was supported by corresponding changes in responses in auditory cortex. By linking neural and behavioral correlates of perception we demonstrate that the number of objects we perceive can depend not only on the physical attributes of our environment, but also on how we intend to experience it.",

Here we focus on characterizing the human brains large-scale network organization, as it provides an overall framework for the organization of all other levels. We developed a highly principled approach to identify cortical network communities at the level of functional systems, calibrating our community detection algorithm using extremely well-established sensory and motor systems as guides. Building on previous network partitions, we replicated and expanded upon well-known and recently identified networks, including several higher-order cognitive networks such as a left-lateralized language network. We expanded these cortical networks to subcortex, revealing 358 highly organized subcortical parcels that take part in forming whole-brain functional networks. Notably, the identified subcortical parcels are similar in number to a recent estimate of the number of cortical parcels (360). This whole-brain network atlas - released as an open resource for the neuroscience community - places all brain structures across both cortex and subcortex into a single large-scale functional framework, with the potential to facilitate a variety of studies investigating large-scale functional networks in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "It is widely agreed that patients with bilateral hippocampal damage are impaired at binding pairs of words together. Consequently, the verbal paired associates (VPA) task has become emblematic of hippocampal function. This VPA deficit is not well understood, and is particularly difficult for hippocampal theories with a visuospatial bias to explain (e.g., cognitive map and scene construction theories). Resolving the tension among hippocampal theories concerning the VPA could be important for leveraging a fuller understanding of hippocampal function. Notably, VPA tasks typically use high imagery concrete words and so conflate imagery and binding. To determine why VPA engages the hippocampus, we devised an fMRI encoding task involving closely matched pairs of scene words, pairs of object words and pairs of very low imagery abstract words. We found that the anterior hippocampus was engaged during processing of both scene and object word pairs in comparison to abstract word pairs, despite binding occurring in all conditions. This was also the case when just subsequently remembered stimuli were considered. Moreover, for object word pairs, fMRI activity patterns in anterior hippocampus were more similar to those for scene imagery than object imagery. This was especially evident in participants who were high imagery users, and not in mid and low imagery users. Overall, our results show that hippocampal engagement during VPA, even when object word pairs are involved, seems to be evoked by scene imagery rather than binding. This may help to resolve the issue that visuospatial hippocampal theories have in accounting for verbal memory.",

We investigated the effect of the risk variant, rs7665090G, located near NFKB1, on astrocytes. We demonstrated that chromatin is accessible at the risk locus, a prerequisite for its impact on astroglial function. The risk variant was associated with increased NF-{kappa}B signaling and target gene expression driving lymphocyte recruitment in cultured human astrocytes and astrocytes within MS lesions, and with increased lesional lymphocytic infiltrates. In MS patients, the risk genotype was associated with increased lesion volumes on MRI. Thus, we established that the rs7665090G variant perturbs astrocyte function resulting in increased CNS access for peripheral immune cells. MS may thus result from variant-driven dysregulation of the peripheral immune system and the CNS, where perturbed CNS cell function aids in establishing local autoimmune inflammation.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryThe NF-{kappa}B relevant multiple sclerosis risk variant, rs7665090G, drives astrocyte responses that promote lesion formation.",

    "abstract": "The motor systems ability to adapt to changes in the environment is essential for maintaining accurate movements. During such adaptation several distinct systems are recruited: cerebellar sensory-prediction error learning, success-based reinforcement, and explicit strategy-use. Although much work has focused on the relationship between cerebellar learning and strategy-use, there is little research regarding how reinforcement and strategy-use interact. To address this, participants first learnt a 20{degrees} visuomotor displacement. After reaching asymptotic performance, binary, hit-or-miss feedback (BF) was introduced either with or without visual feedback, the latter promoting reinforcement. Subsequently, retention was assessed using no-feedback trials, with half of the participants in each group being instructed to stop using any strategy. Although BF led to an increase in retention of the visuomotor displacement, instructing participants to remove their strategy nullified this effect, suggesting strategy-use is critical to BF-based reinforcement. In a second experiment, we prevented the expression or development of a strategy during BF performance, by either constraining participants to a short preparation time (expression) or by introducing the displacement gradually (development). As both strongly impaired BF performance, it suggests reinforcement requires both the development and expression of a strategy. These results emphasise a pivotal role of strategy-use during reinforcement-based motor learning.",

    "abstract": "How are brief encounters transformed into lasting memories? Previous research has established the role of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, along with its electrophysiological signatures of slow oscillations (SOs) and spindles, for memory consolidation. More recently, experimental manipulations have demonstrated that NREM sleep provides a window of opportunity to selectively strengthen particular memory traces via the delivery of sensory cues. It has remained unclear, however, whether experimental memory cueing triggers the brains endogenous consolidation mechanisms (linked to SOs and/or spindles) and whether those mechanisms in turn mediate effective processing of the cue information. Here we devised a novel paradigm in which associative memories (adjective-object and adjective-scene pairs) were selectively cued during a post-learning nap, successfully stabilising next-day retention relative to non-cued memories. First, we found that compared to novel control adjectives, memory cues were accompanied by an increase in fast spindles coupled to SO up states. Critically, EEG pattern decodability of the associated memory category (object vs. scene) was temporally linked to cue-induced spindles and predicted next-day retrieval performance across participants. These results provide highly controlled empirical evidence for an information processing role of sleep spindles in service of memory consolidation.",

    "abstract": "In real-life decision-making, sub-optimal risk-taking seems characteristic of adolescents. Such behavior increases the chance of serious negative, and at times, irreversible outcomes for this population (e.g., road traffic accidents, addictions). We are still lacking conclusive evidence, however, for an inverted U-shaped developmental trajectory for risk-taking. This raises the question whether adolescents are really more risk-prone or when facing a novel risky situation, they behave just as children and adults do. To answer this question, we used the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) to assess the risky decision making of 188 individuals ranging in age from 7 to 30. The BART provided useful data for characterizing multiple aspects of risk-taking. Surprisingly, we found that adolescents were not more inclined to take risks than children or young adults. Participants in all age groups were able to adapt their learning processes to the probabilistic environment and improve their performance during the sequential risky choice. There were no age-related differences in risk-taking at any stage of the task. Likewise, neither negative feedback reactivity nor overall task performance distinguished adolescents from the younger and older age groups. Our findings prompt 1) methodological considerations about the validity of the BART and 2) theoretical debate whether the amount of experience on its own may account for age-related changes in real-life risk-taking, since risk-taking in a novel and uncertain situation was invariant across developmental stages.",

Applying spaced blocks of TBS can affect both the direction and magnitude of plasticity, but the impact of interval duration on these interactions following intermittent TBS (iTBS) is unclear.\\n\\nObjectivesTo assess the effect of interval duration on plasticity magnitude/direction following spaced iTBS.\\n\\nMethods15 healthy participants received three different iTBS conditions on separate days: single iTBS; spaced iTBS with a 5 minute interval (iTBS-5); and spaced iTBS with a 15 minute interval (iTBS-15). Changes in cortical excitability and short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI) resulting from iTBS were assessed via motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) measured from the first dorsal interosseus muscle before and up to 60 mins following stimulation.\\n\\nResultsiTBS-15 increased MEP amplitude up to 60 mins post stimulation, whereas iTBS-5 decreased MEP amplitude. In contrast, MEP amplitude was not altered by single iTBS. Despite the significant effect of iTBS-15 on MEP amplitude at the group level, there was still considerable inter-individual variability, with only 53% of individuals meeting response criteria. Modulation of SICI did not differ between conditions.\\n\\nConclusionsThe interval duration between spaced iTBS plays an important role in determining the direction of plasticity on excitatory, but not inhibitory circuits in human motor cortex. While iTBS-15 can increase the magnitude of facilitation in some individuals compared to single iTBS, this approach still suffers from high inter-individual variability.",

Here, we combined psychophysics and time-resolved neuroimaging to explore metacognitive inference on the accuracy of a self-generated behavior. Human participants generated a time interval and evaluated the signed magnitude of their temporal production. We show that both self-generation and self-evaluation relied on the power of beta oscillations ({beta}; 15-40 Hz) with increases in early {beta} power predictive of increases in duration. We characterized the dynamics of {beta} power in a low dimensional space ({beta} state-space trajectories) as a function of timing and found that the more distinct trajectories, the more accurate metacognitive inferences were. These results suggest that {beta} states instantiates an internal variable determining the fate of the timing networks trajectory, possibly as release from inhibition.

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is perhaps the most widely used brain-imaging technique for paediatric populations. However, EEG signals are prone to distortion by motion. Compared to adults, infants motion is both more frequent and less stereotypical yet motion effects on the infant EEG signal are largely undocumented. Here, we present a systematic assessment of naturalistic motion effects on the infant and adult EEG signal. In Study 1, we documented the prevalence of 27 naturally occurring facial and body motions by video-coding five mother-infant pairs during naturalistic play. In Study 2, we elicited a subset of the most common facial, limb and postural motions from one adult and one infant actor while their EEG was recorded. In Study 3, we recorded EEG signals from a larger group of 12 infants whilst they produced the same motions spontaneously. Our findings from Study 2 suggested that adult movements mainly generated increases in spectral power relative to resting state, primarily at peripheral sites and in delta and high-beta frequency bands. In infants, both elicited motions (N=1, Study 2) and spontaneously-occurring motions (N=12, Study 3) produced decreases in theta, alpha and beta power over central regions and increased beta/delta power at peripheral sites. We also observed that infants jaw and upper limb movements generated more pronounced EEG artifacts than lower limb movements. It is intended that this work will inform future development of methods for addressing EEG motion-related artifacts and support wider use of naturalistic paradigms in social and developmental neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "The functions of RNA pseudoknots (PKs), which are minimal tertiary structural motifs and an integral part of several ribozymes and ribonucleoprotein complexes, are determined by their structure, stability and dynamics. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the general principles governing their thermodynamics/folding mechanisms. Here, we combine experiments and simulations to examine the folding/unfolding pathways of the VPK pseudoknot, a variant of the Mouse Mammary Tumor Virus (MMTV) PK involved in ribosomal frameshifting. Fluorescent nucleotide analogs (2-aminopurine and pyrrolocytidine) placed at different stem/loop positions in the PK, and laser temperature-jump approaches serve as local probes allowing us to monitor the order of assembly of VPK with two helices with different intrinsic stabilities. The experiments and molecular simulations show that at 50 mM KCl the dominant folding pathway populates only the more stable partially folded hairpin. As the salt concentration is increased a parallel folding pathway emerges, involving the less stable hairpin structure as an alternate intermediate. Notably, the flux between the pathways is modulated by the ionic strength. The findings support the principle that the order of PK structure formation is determined by the relative stabilities of the hairpins, which can be altered by sequence variations or salt concentrations. Our study not only unambiguously demonstrates that PK folds by parallel pathways, but also establishes that quantitative description of RNA self-assembly requires a synergistic combination of experiments and simulations.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCEThe assembly mechanism of RNA, vital to describing their functions, depends on both the sequence and the metal ion concentration. How the latter influences the folding trajectories remains an important unsolved problem. Here, we examine the folding pathways of an RNA pseudoknot (PK) with key functional roles in transcription and translation, using a combination of experiments and simulations. We demonstrate that the PK, consisting of two helices with differing stabilities, folds by parallel pathways. Surprisingly, the flux between them is modulated by monovalent salt concentration. Our work shows that the order of assembly of PKs is determined by the relative stability of the helices, implying that the folding landscape can be controlled by sequence and ion concentration.",

In C. elegans, this activation process, called spermiogenesis, transforms round immobile spermatids into motile, fertilization-competent spermatozoa. We describe the phenotypic and genetic characterization of spe-43, a new component of the spe-8 pathway, which is required for spermiogenesis in hermaphrodites; spe-43 hermaphrodites are self-sterile, while spe-43 males show wild-type fertility. When exposed to Pronase to activate sperm in vitro, spe-43 spermatids form long rigid spikes radiating outward from the cell periphery instead of forming a motile pseudopod, indicating that spermiogenesis initiates but is not completed. Using a combination of recombinant and deletion mapping and whole genome sequencing, we identified F09E8.1 as spe-43. SPE-43 is predicted to exist in two isoforms; one isoform appears to be a single-pass transmembrane protein while the other is predicted to be a secreted protein. SPE-43 can bind to other known sperm proteins, including SPE-4 and SPE-29, which are known to impact spermiogenesis. In summary, we have identified a membrane protein that is present in C. elegans sperm and is required for sperm activation via the hermaphrodite activation signal.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in technology have enabled the measurement of RNA levels for individual cells. Compared to traditional tissue-level bulk RNA-seq data, single cell sequencing yields valuable insights about gene expression profiles for different cell types, which is potentially critical for understanding many complex human diseases. However, developing quantitative tools for such data remains challenging because of high levels of technical noise, especially the \\\"dropout\\\" events. A \\\"dropout\\\" happens when the RNA for a gene fails to be amplified prior to sequencing, producing a \\\"false\\\" zero in the observed data. In this paper, we propose a Unified RNA-Sequencing Model (URSM) for both single cell and bulk RNA-seq data, formulated as a hierarchical model. URSM borrows the strength from both data sources and carefully models the dropouts in single cell data, leading to a more accurate estimation of cell type specific gene expression profile. In addition, URSM naturally provides inference on the dropout entries in single cell data that need to be imputed for downstream analyses, as well as the mixing proportions of different cell types in bulk samples. We adopt an empirical Bayes approach, where parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm and approximate inference is obtained by Gibbs sampling. Simulation results illustrate that URSM outperforms existing approaches both in correcting for dropouts in single cell data, as well as in deconvolving bulk samples. We also demonstrate an application to gene expression data on fetal brains, where our model successfully imputes the dropout genes and reveals cell type specific expression patterns.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are the first immune cells recruited to a site of injury or infection, where they perform many functions. Having completed their role, neutrophils must be removed from the inflammatory site - either by apoptosis and efferocytosis or by reverse migration away from the wound - for restoration of normal tissue homeostasis. Disruption of these tightly controlled physiological processes of neutrophil removal can lead to a range of inflammatory diseases. We used an in vivo zebrafish model to understand the role of lipid mediator production in neutrophil removal. Following tailfin amputation in the absence of macrophages, neutrophillic inflammation does not resolve. This is due to loss of macrophage-dependent production of eicosanoid prostaglandin E2, which drives neutrophil removal via promotion of reverse migration. Knockdown of endogenous prostaglandin E synthase gene reveals PGE2 as essential for neutrophil inflammation resolution. Furthermore, PGE2 is able to signal through EP4 receptors to enhance Alox15 production, causing a switch towards anti-inflammatory eicosanoid signalling, specifically Lipoxin A4. Our data confirm regulation of neutrophil migration by PGE2 and LXA4 in an in vivo model of inflammation resolution. This pathway may contain therapeutic targets for driving inflammation resolution in chronic inflammatory disease.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary and developmental increases in primate brain size have been accompanied by systematic shifts in the proportionality of different primate brain systems. However, it remains unknown if and how brain patterning varies across the more than 2-fold inter-individual variation in brain size that occurs amongst typically-developing humans. Using in vivo neuroimaging data from 2 independent cohorts totaling nearly 3000 individuals, we find that larger-brained humans show preferential areal expansion within specific fronto-parietal cortical networks (default mode, dorsal attentional) and related subcortical regions, at the expense of primary sensory/motor systems. This targeted areal expansion recapitulates cortical remodeling across evolution, manifests by early childhood and is linked to molecular signatures of heightened metabolic cost. Our results define a new organizing principle in human brain patterning which governs the highly-coordinated remodeling of human brain shape as a function of naturally-occurring variations in brain size.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryA hodologically and metabolically expensive brain network is preferentially expanded in larger-brained humans.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in brain and behavior are programmed during development by gonadal hormones. We found that the immune system-derived mast cell is a primary target for the masculinizing hormone, estradiol. Male rats had more mast cells in the preoptic area (POA), a brain region essential for male copulatory behavior, during the critical period for sexual differentiation. Activating mast cells in females masculinized POA neuronal and microglial morphology and adult sex behavior, and inhibiting mast cells in males blunted masculinization. Estradiol increased mast cell number and caused mast cells to release histamine, which stimulated microglia to release prostaglandins and thereby induced male-typical synaptic patterning. Inducing an allergic reaction in pregnant dams increased mast cell number in the brains of female fetuses and masculinized neuronal and microglia morphology and adult copulatory behavior. These findings identify a novel non-neuronal origin of brain sex differences and non-steroidal source of variability in brain feminization.",

    "abstract": "(Z)-4-undecenal (Z4-11Al) is the volatile pheromone produced by females of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. Female flies emit Z4-11Al for species-specific communication and mate-finding. A sensory panel finds that synthetic Z4-11Al has a characteristic flavour, which we perceive even at the small amounts produced by one female fly. Since only females produce Z4-11Al, and not males, we can reliably distinguish between single D. melanogaster males and females, according to their scent. Females release Z4-11Al at 2.4 ng/h and we readily sense 1 ng synthetic Z4-11Al in a glass of wine (0.03 nmol/L), while a tenfold concentration is perceived as a loud off-flavour. This corroborates the observation that a glass of wine is spoilt by a single D. melanogaster fly falling into it, which we here show is caused by Z4-11Al. The biological role of Z4-11Al or structurally related aldehydes in humans and the basis for this semiochemical convergence remains yet unclear.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAlthough seldom acknowledged explicitly, count data generated by sequencing platforms exist as compositions for which the abundance of each component (e.g., gene or transcript) is only coherently interpretable relative to other components within that sample. This property arises from the assay technology itself, whereby the number of counts recorded for each sample is constrained by an arbitrary total sum (i.e., library size). Consequently, sequencing data, as compositional data, exist in a non-Euclidean space that renders invalid many conventional analyses, including distance measures, correlation coefficients, and multivariate statistical models.\\n\\nResultsThe purpose of this review is to summarize the principles of compositional data analysis (CoDA), provide evidence for why sequencing data are compositional, discuss compositionally valid methods available for analyzing sequencing data, and highlight future directions with regard to this field of study.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResponses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are notoriously variable. Previous studies have observed a dependence of TMS-induced responses on ongoing brain activity, for instance sensorimotor rhythms. This suggests an opportunity for the development of more effective stimulation protocols through closed-loop TMS-EEG. However, it is not yet clear how features of ongoing activity affect the responses of cortical circuits to TMS.\\n\\nObjective/HypothesisHere we investigate the dependence of TMS-responses on power and phase of ongoing oscillatory activity in a computational model of TMS-induced I-waves.\\n\\nMethodsThe model comprises populations of cortical layer 2/3 (L2/3) neurons and a population of cortical layer 5 (L5) neurons and generates I-waves in response to TMS. Oscillatory input to the L2/3 neurons induces rhythmic fluctuations in activity of L5 neurons. TMS pulses are simulated at different phases and amplitudes of the ongoing rhythm.\\n\\nResultsThe model shows a robust dependence of I-wave properties on phase and power of ongoing rhythms, with the strongest response occurring for TMS at maximal L5 depolarization. The amount of phase-modulation depends on stimulation intensity, with stronger modulation for lower intensity.\\n\\nConclusionThe model predicts that responses to TMS are highly variable for low stimulation intensities if ongoing brain rhythms are not taken into account. Closed-loop TMS-EEG holds promise for obtaining more reliable TMS effects.",
