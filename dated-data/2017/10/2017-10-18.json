    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) has revolutionized the field of computer vision and image processing. In medical imaging, algorithmic solutions based on DL have been shown to achieve high performance on tasks that previously required medical experts. However, DL-based solutions for disease detection have been proposed without methods to quantify and control their uncertainty in a decision. In contrast, a physician knows whether she is uncertain about a case and will consult more experienced colleagues if needed. Here we evaluate drop-out based Bayesian uncertainty measures for DL in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy (DR) from fundus images and show that it captures uncertainty better than straightforward alternatives. Furthermore, we show that uncertainty informed decision referral can improve diagnostic performance. Experiments across different networks, tasks and datasets show robust generalization. Depending on network capacity and task/dataset difficulty, we surpass 85% sensitivity and 80% specificity as recommended by the NHS when referring 0%-20% of the most uncertain decisions for further inspection. We analyse causes of uncertainty by relating intuitions from 2D visualizations to the high-dimensional image space. While uncertainty is sensitive to clinically relevant cases, sensitivity to unfamiliar data samples is task dependent, but can be rendered more robust.",

    "abstract": "Understanding demographic trends and patterns of gene flow in an endangered species is crucial for devising conservation strategies. Here, we examined the extent of population structure and recent evolution of the critically endangered Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis). By analysing genetic variation at the mitochondrial and nuclear microsatellite loci for 148 individuals, we identified three populations along the Yangtze River, each one connected to a group of admixed ancestry. Each population displayed extremely low genetic diversity, consistent with extremely small effective size ([&le;]92 individuals). Habitat degradation and distribution gaps correlated with highly asymmetric gene-flow that was inefficient in maintaining connectivity between populations. Genetic inferences of historical demography revealed that the populations in the Yangtze descended from a small number of founders colonizing the river from the sea during the last Ice Age. The colonization was followed by a rapid population split during the last millennium predating the Chinese Modern Economy Development. However, genetic diversity showed a clear footprint of population contraction over the last 50 years leaving only ~2% of the pre-collapsed size, consistent with the population collapses reported from field studies. This genetic perspective provides background information for devising mitigation strategies to prevent this species from extinction.",

    "abstract": "A transcortical pathway helps support goal-directed reaching by processing somatosensory information to produce rapid feedback responses across multiple joints and muscles. Here we tested whether such feedback responses can account for changes in arm configuration and for arbitrary visuomotor transformations - two manipulations that alter how muscles at the elbow and wrist need to be coordinated to achieve task success. Participants used a planar three degree-of-freedom exoskeleton robot to move a cursor to a target following a mechanical perturbation that flexed the elbow. In our first experiment, the cursor was mapped to the veridical position of the robot handle, but participants grasped the handle with two different hand orientations (thumb pointing upward or thumb point downward). We found that large rapid feedback responses were evoked in wrist extensor muscles when wrist extension helped move the cursor to the target (i.e., thumb upward), and in wrist flexor muscles when wrist flexion helped move the cursor to the target (i.e., thumb downward). In our second experiment, participants grasped the robot handle with their thumb pointing upward, but the cursors movement was either veridical, or was mirrored such that flexing the wrist moved the cursor as if the participant extended their wrist, and vice versa. After extensive practice, we found that rapid feedback responses were appropriately tuned to the wrist muscles that supported moving the cursor to the target when the cursor was mapped to the mirrored movement of the wrist, but were not tuned to the appropriate wrist muscles when the cursor was remapped to the wrists veridical movement.",

    "abstract": "Many neuroimaging studies collect functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in a longitudinal manner. However, the current network modeling literature lacks a general framework for analyzing functional connectivity (FC) networks in fMRI data obtained from a longitudinal study. In this work, we build a novel longitudinal FC network model using a variance components approach. First, for all subjects visits, we account for the autocorrelation inherent in the fMRI time series data using a non-parametric technique. Second, we use a generalized least squares approach to estimate 1) the within-subject variance component shared across the population, 2) the FC network, and 3) the FC networks longitudinal trend. Our novel method for longitudinal FC networks seeks to account for the within-subject dependence across multiple visits, the variability due to the subjects being sampled from a population, and the autocorrelation present in fMRI data, while restricting the number of parameters in order to make the method computationally feasible and stable. We develop a permutation testing procedure to draw valid inference on group differences in baseline FC and change in FC over time between a set of patients and a comparable set of controls. To examine performance, we run a series of simulations and apply the model to longitudinal fMRI data collected from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments typically analyze hundreds or thousands of cells after amplification of the cDNA. The high throughput is made possible by the early introduction of sample-specific barcodes (BCs) and the amplification bias is alleviated by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Thus the ideal analysis pipeline for scRNA-seq data needs to efficiently tabulate reads according to both BC and UMI. zUMIs is such a pipeline, it can handle both known and random BCs and also efficiently collapses UMIs, either just for Exon mapping reads or for both Exon and Intron mapping reads. Another unique feature of zUMIs is the adaptive downsampling function, that facilitates dealing with hugely varying library sizes, but also allows to evaluate whether the library has been sequenced to saturation. zUMIs flexibility allows to accommodate data generated with any of the major scRNA-seq protocols that use BCs and UMIs. To illustrate the utility of zUMIs, we analysed a single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset and show that more than 35% of all reads map to Introns. We furthermore show that these intronic reads are informative about expression levels, significantly increasing the number of detected genes and improving the cluster resolution.

Here we used  connectome-harmonic decomposition, a novel method to investigate the dynamical changes in brain states. We found that LSD alters the energy and the power of individual harmonic brain states in a frequency-selective manner. Remarkably, this leads to an expansion of the repertoire of active brain states, suggestive of a general re-organization of brain dynamics given the non-random increase in co-activation across frequencies. Interestingly, the frequency distribution of the active repertoire of brain states under LSD closely follows power-laws indicating a re-organization of the dynamics at the edge of criticality. Beyond the present findings, these methods open up for a better understanding of the complex brain dynamics in health and disease.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIIntroducing a novel connectome-harmonic decomposition of human brain activity, which is used to study the dynamics after administration of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)\\nC_LIO_LILSD alters the total energy and power of individual harmonics in a frequency-selective manner and increases the size of the dynamical repertoire of these brain states\\nC_LIO_LIThe repertoire expansion occurs in a non-random fashion suggesting a re-organization of brain dynamics at the edge of criticality\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In this study, we describe the changes associated with three months of intermittent fasting and probiotic yogurt consumption in a 72-year-old marathon runner with chronic lymphocytic leukemia for a number of years. Serum alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (nagalase), a marker of inflammation and cancer cell proliferation, was significantly decreased at the end of a three-month observation. These results are consistent with immune modulating properties of certain probiotics based on the fermentation of milk and colostrum. Urinary excretion of non-metal toxicants that accumulate in adipose tissue such as Perchlorate, N-acetyl(2-hydroxypropyl)cysteine (NAHP), 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 3-Phenoxybenzoic acid (3PBA), N-acetyl phenyl cysteine (NAP), Phenylglycoxylic acid (PGO), Monoethylphthalate (MEP) and 2-Hydroxyisobutyric Acid (2HIB) was significantly increased. These results are consistent with the weight loss (5 Kg) associated with intermittent fasting and with the known features of probiotics as detoxification tools. Consistent with certain toxicants acting as endocrine disruptors, we observed an increased elimination of toxicants and a 33% decrease of serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH), suggesting a trend toward normalization of thyroid function. These results support the hypothesis that a combination of intermittent fasting with the consumption of specific probiotic yogurts may lead to immune modulation, detoxification and other improvements.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "The ability for cut tissues to join together and form a chimeric organism is a remarkable property of many plants, however, grafting is poorly characterized at the molecular level. To better understand this process we monitored genome-wide temporal and spatial gene expression changes in grafted Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls. Tissues above and below the graft rapidly developed an asymmetry such that many genes were more highly expressed on one side than the other. This asymmetry correlated with sugar responsive genes and we observed an accumulation of starch above the graft that decreased along with asymmetry once the sugar-transporting vascular tissues reconnected. Despite the initial starvation response below the graft, many genes associated with vascular formation were rapidly activated in grafted tissues but not in cut and separated tissues indicating that a recognition mechanism activated that was independent of functional vascular connections. Auxin which is transported cell-to-cell, had a rapidly elevated response that was symmetric, suggesting that auxin was perceived by the root within hours of tissue attachment to activate the vascular regeneration process. A subset of genes were expressed only in grafted tissues, indicating that wound healing proceeded via different mechanisms depending on the presence or absence of adjoining tissues. Such a recognition process could have broader relevance for tissue regeneration, inter-tissue communication and tissue fusion events.",

Here we give structural evidence into GH13 classification and evolution using structural information. Here we proposed a novel method that is sensitive enough to identify miss-classifications, or to provide evidence for further partition that can be of interests to bio-engineers and evolutionary biologists. We also introduced a method to explore the relative importance of residues with respect to the overall deformation that it causes to the overall structure in an evolutionary time scale. We found that the GH13 family can be classified into three main structural groups. There is a hierarchical structure within these clusters that can be use to inform other classification schemes. We also found that by using structural information, subtle structural shifts can be identified and that can be missed in sequence/phylogeny-only based classifications. When each structural group is explored, we found that identifying the most structurally variable sites can lead to identification of functionally (both catalytically and structurally) important residues.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVaccination has reduced the global incidence of measles to the lowest rates in history. However, local interruption of measles virus transmission requires sustained high levels of population immunity that can be challenging to achieve and maintain. The herd immunity threshold for measles is typically stipulated at 90-95%. This figure does not easily translate into age-specific immunity levels required to interrupt transmission. Previous estimates of such levels were based on speculative contact patterns based on historical data from high-income countries. The aim of this study was to determine age-specific immunity levels that would ensure elimination of measles when taking into account empirically observed contact patterns.\\n\\nMethodsWe combined estimated immunity levels from serological data in 17 countries with studies of age-specific mixing patterns to derive contact-adjusted immunity levels. We then compared these to case data from the 10 years following the seroprevalence studies to establish a contact-adjusted immunity threshold for elimination. We lastly combined a range of hypothetical immunity profiles with contact data from a wide range of socioeconomic and demographic settings to determine whether they would be sufficient for elimination.\\n\\nResultsWe found that contact-adjusted immunity levels were able to predict whether countries would experience outbreaks in the decade following the serological studies in about 70% of countries. The corresponding threshold level of contact-adjusted immunity was found to be 93%, corresponding to an average basic reproduction number of approximately 14. Testing different scenarios of immunity with this threshold level using contact studies from around the world, we found that 95% immunity would have to be achieved by the age of five and maintained across older age groups to guarantee elimination. This reflects a greater level of immunity required in 5-9 year olds than established previously.\\n\\nConclusionsThe immunity levels we found necessary for measles elimination are higher than previous guidance. The importance of achieving high immunity levels in 5-9 year olds presents both a challenge and an opportunity. While such high levels can be difficult to achieve, school entry provides an opportunity to ensure sufficient vaccination coverage. Combined with observations of contact patterns, further national and sub-national serological studies could serve to highlight key gaps in immunity that need to be filled in order to achieve national and regional measles elimination.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosomes form the fundamental building blocks of eukaryotic chromatin, and previous attempts to understand the principles governing their genome-wide distribution have spurred much interest and debate in biology. In particular, the precise role of DNA sequence in shaping local chromatin structure has been controversial. This paper rigorously quantifies of the contribution of hitherto-debated sequence features - including G+C content, 10.5-bp periodicity, and poly(dA:dT) tracts - to three distinct aspects of genome-wide nucleosome landscape: occupancy, translational positioning and rotational positioning. Our computational framework simultaneously learns nucleosome number and nucleosome-positioning energy from genome-wide nucleosome maps. In contrast to other previous studies, our model can predict both in-vitro and in-vivo nucleosome maps in S. cerevisiae. We find that although G+C content is the primary determinant of MNase-derived nucleosome occupancy, MNase digestion biases may substantially influence this GC dependence. By contrast, poly(dA:dT) tracts are seen to deter nucleosome formation, regardless of the experimental method used. We further show that the 10.5-bp nucleotide periodicity facilitates rotational but not translational positioning. Applying our method to in-vivo nucleosome maps demonstrates that, for a subset of genes, the regularly-spaced nucleosome arrays observed around transcription start sites can be partially recapitulated by DNA sequence alone. Finally, in-vivo nucleosome occupancy derived from MNase-seq experiments around transcription termination sites can be mostly explained by the genomic sequence. Implications of these results and potential extensions of the proposed computational framework are discussed",

Several studies using the Tic Suppression Task have demonstrated significant inter-individual variability in tic suppressibility but have individually been underpowered to address correlates of tic suppression. The present study explored patterns and clinical correlates of tic suppression in youth with tic disorders using a large, pooled dataset.\\n\\nMethods: Individual-level data from 9 studies using the Tic Suppression Task were pooled, yielding a sample of 99 youth with tic disorders. Analyses examined patterns of tic suppressibility and the relationship between tic suppressibility and demographic and clinical characteristics.\\n\\nResults: A large majority of youth demonstrated a high degree of tic suppression, but heterogeneous patterns of tic suppressibility were also observed. Better tic suppressibility was related to older age and more frequent tics but unrelated to other clinical variables, including presence of psychiatric comorbidity, psychotropic medication status, and tic and premonitory urge severity.\\n\\nConclusions: The mechanisms underlying the observed heterogeneity in tic suppressibility warrant further investigation. The Tic Suppression Task is a promising method for testing mechanistic hypotheses related to tic suppression.",

    "abstract": "Motivation: A popular approach for predicting RNA secondary structure is the thermodynamic nearest neighbor model that finds a thermodynamically most stable secondary structure with the minimum free energy (MFE). For further improvement, an alternative approach that is based on machine learning techniques has been developed. The machine learning based approach can employ a fine-grained model that includes much richer feature representations with the ability to fit the training data. Although a machine learning based fine-grained model achieved extremely high performance in prediction accuracy, a possibility of the risk of overfitting for such model has been reported.\\n\\nResults: In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for RNA secondary structure prediction that integrates the thermodynamic approach and the machine learning based weighted approach. Ourfine-grained model combines the experimentally determined thermodynamic parameters with a large number of scoring parameters for detailed contexts of features that are trained by the structured support vector machine (SSVM) with the{ell} 1 regularization to avoid overfitting. Our benchmark shows that our algorithm achieves the best prediction accuracy compared with existing methods, and heavy overfitting cannot be observed.\\n\\nAvailability: The implementation of our algorithm is available at https://github.com/keio-bioinformatics/mxfold.\\n\\nContact: satoken@bio.keio.ac.jp",

    "abstract": "Tropical forests are becoming increasingly fragmented through conversion to agriculture, with negative consequences for biodiversity. Movement of individuals among the remaining fragments is critical to allow populations of forest-dependent taxa to persist. In SE Asia, conversion of forests to oil palm plantations is a particular threat. Many oil palm dominated landscapes retain forested riparian reserves along streams and rivers, but the extent to which these riparian reserves are used for movement, relative to the oil palm matrix, is poorly understood. We used mark-release-recapture methods to investigate the movement of five moth taxa in riparian reserves connected to a continuous forest area within oil palm matrix in Sabah, Malaysian Borneo. Moths were recaptured on average 68m from the release point, and the mean time to recapture was between 2 and 3 days. Moths showed a significant tendency to move within forested riparian reserves than into adjacent oil palm. When moving within riparian reserves moths also showed a tendency to orient their movement away from the continuous forest into the riparian reserve rather than towards continuous forest or into oil palm. Overall, our results show a role for riparian reserves as movement corridors through oil palm plantations for some invertebrate species, strengthening the case for their retention and re-establishment.",

To test this, we performed neural recordings from area 7a while monkeys were passively translated or rotated at various speeds. Visual stimuli were delivered as optic flow fields and vestibular stimuli were generated by a motion platform. Under both conditions, the responses of a fraction of neurons scaled linearly with self-motion speed, and speed-selective neurons were not localized to specific layers or columns. We analyzed ensembles of simultaneously recorded neurons and found that the precision of speed representation was sufficient to support path integration over modest distances.

The way the pulvinar interacts with cortex is governed by its intrinsic organization. Here, we show using fMRI that the human pulvinar is functionally heterogeneous, broadly separated into dorsal and ventral subdivisions based on characterization of response properties and functional connectivity with cortex. These differences mirrored the organization of the dorsal and ventral streams of visual cortex. The ventral subdivision of the pulvinar was functionally coupled with occipital and temporal cortex. The dorsal subdivision of the pulvinar was functionally coupled with frontal and parietal cortex. The dorsal subdivision was also coupled with the human-specific tool network and to the default mode network. The spatial organization of pulvino-cortical coupling reflected both the functional similarities and anatomical distances between cortical areas. Together, the human pulvinar appears to represent the entire visual system and the principles that govern its organization, though in a spatially compressed form.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsMA, MP, and JC collected data; MA and JC analyzed the data; MA, MP, JC, and SK wrote the paper.",

    "abstract": "The integration of multiple sensory modalities is one of the key aspects of brain function, allowing animals to take advantage of concurrent sources of information to make more accurate perceptual judgments. For many years, it was thought that multisensory integration in the cerebral cortex only occurs in high-level \\\"polysensory\\\" association areas, but recent studies have demonstrated cross-modal influences in regions that were traditionally designated as unimodal. In particular, several human neuroimaging studies have reported that extrastriate areas involved in visual motion perception are also activated by auditory motion, and may integrate audio-visual motion cues. However, the exact nature and extent of the effects of auditory motion on the visual cortex have not been studied at the single neuron level. We recorded the spiking activity of neurons in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anesthetized marmoset monkeys upon presentation of unimodal stimuli (moving auditory or visual patterns), as well as bimodal stimuli (concurrent audio-visual motion). Despite robust, direction selective responses to visual motion, none of the sampled neurons responded to auditory motion stimuli. Moreover, concurrent moving auditory stimuli had no significant effect on the ability of single MT and MST neurons, or populations of simultaneously recorded neurons, to discriminate the direction of motion of visual stimuli (moving random dot patterns with varying levels of motion noise). Our findings do not support the hypothesis that direct interactions between MT, MST and areas low in the hierarchy of auditory areas underlie audiovisual motion integration.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany studies have demonstrated that brain regions originally thought to be unisensory may play a role in multisensory processing. For example, some neuroimaging studies have found activity in regions involved in the processing of visual motion can be modified by auditory motion. We tested whether the spiking activity of neurons in two visual motion processing areas of the primate brain, areas MT and MST, can be modulated by moving auditory stimuli. Our results revealed that neurons in these areas neither respond to auditory motion, nor change their responses to visual motion according to auditory motion along the frontoparallel plane. These findings call into question the idea that audio-visual integration occurs at early stages of processing in the extrastriate cortex.",

    "abstract": "Recent molecular genetic studies have shown that the majority of genes associated with obesity are expressed in the central nervous system. Obesity has also been associated with neurobehavioural factors such as brain morphology, cognitive performance, and personality. Here, we tested whether these neurobehavioural factors were associated with the heritable variance in obesity measured by body mass index (BMI) in the Human Connectome Project (N=895 siblings). Phenotypically, cortical thickness findings supported the \\\"right brain hypothesis\\\" for obesity. Namely, increased BMI associated with decreased cortical thickness in right frontal lobe and increased thickness in the left frontal lobe, notably in lateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, lower thickness and volume in entorhinal-parahippocampal structures, and increased thickness in parietal-occipital structures in obese participants supported the role of visuospatial function in obesity. Brain morphometry results were supported by cognitive tests, which outlined obesitys negative association with visuospatial function, verbal episodic memory, impulsivity, and cognitive flexibility. Personality-obesity correlations were inconsistent. We then aggregated the effects for each neurobehavioural factor for a behavioural genetics analysis and demonstrated the factors genetic overlap with obesity. Namely, cognitive test scores and brain morphometry had 0.25 - 0.45 genetic correlations with obesity, and the phenotypic correlations with obesity were 77-89% explained by genetic factors. Neurobehavioural factors also had some genetic overlap with each other. In summary, obesity has considerable genetic overlap with brain and cognitive measures. This supports the theory that obesity is inherited via brain function, and may inform intervention strategies.\\n\\nSignificance StatementObesity is a widespread heritable health condition. Evidence from psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and genetics has proposed links between obesity and the brain. The current study tested whether the heritable variance in obesity is explained by brain and behavioural factors in a large brain imaging cohort that included multiple related individuals. We found that the heritable variance in obesity had genetic correlations 0.25 - 0.45 with cognitive tests, cortical thickness, and regional brain volume. In particular, obesity was associated with frontal lobe asymmetry and differences in temporal-parietal perceptual systems. Further, we found genetic overlap between certain brain and behavioural factors. In summary, the genetic vulnerability to obesity is expressed in the brain. This may inform intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Effects of seasonal or daily temperature variation on fitness and physiology of ectothermic organisms and their ways to cope with such variations have been widely studied. However, the way multivoltines organisms cope with temperature variations from a generation to another is still not well understood and complex to identify. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the multivoltine midge Chironomus riparius Meigen (1803) responds mainly via acclimation as predicted by current theories, or if rapid genetic adaptation is involved. To investigate this issue, a common garden approach has been applied. A mix of larvae from five European populations was raised in the laboratory at three different pre-exposure temperatures (PET): 14, 20, 26{degrees}C. After three and five generations respectively, larvae were exposed to three treatment temperatures (TT) 14, 20, 26{degrees}C, mortality was monitored for the first 48h and after emergence. After three generations significant mortality rate differences depended on an interaction of PET and TT. This finding supports the hypothesis that chironomids respond rapidly to climatic variation via adaptive mechanisms, and to a lesser extent via phenotypic plasticity. The result of the experiment indicates that three generations were sufficient to adapt to warm temperature, decreasing the mortality rate, highlighting the potential for chironomids to rapidly respond to seasonally changing conditions.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAs most of the heritability of complex traits is attributed to common and low frequency genetic variants, imputing them by combining genotyping chips and large sequenced reference panels is the most cost-effective approach to discover the genetic basis of these traits. Association summary statistics from genome-wide meta-analyses are available for hundreds of traits. Updating these to ever-increasing reference panels is very cumbersome as it requires reimputation of the genetic data, rerunning the association scan, and meta-analysing the results. A much more efficient method is to directly impute the summary statistics, termed as summary statistics imputation. Its performance relative to genotype imputation and practical utility has not yet been fully investigated. To this end, we compared the two approaches on real (genotyped and imputed) data from 120K samples from the UK Biobank and show that, while genotype imputation boasts a 2- to 5-fold lower root-mean-square error, summary statistics imputation better distinguishes true associations from null ones: We observed the largest differences in power for variants with low minor allele frequency and low imputation quality. For fixed false positive rates of 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, using summary statistics imputation yielded an increase in statistical power by 15, 10 and 3%, respectively. To test its capacity to discover novel associations, we applied summary statistics imputation to the GIANT height meta-analysis summary statistics covering HapMap variants, and identified 34 novel loci, 19 of which replicated using data in the UK Biobank. Additionally, we successfully replicated 55 out of the 111 variants published in an exome chip study. Our study demonstrates that summary statistics imputation is a very efficient and cost-effective way to identify and fine-map trait-associated loci. Moreover, the ability to impute summary statistics is important for follow-up analyses, such as Mendelian randomisation or LD-score regression.\\n\\nAuthor summaryGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) quantify the effect of genetic variants and traits, such as height. Such estimates are called association summary statistics and are typically publicly shared through publication. Typically, GWASs are carried out by genotyping ~ 500'000 SNVs for each individual which are then combined with sequenced reference panels to infer untyped SNVs in each individuals genome. This process of genotype imputation is resource intensive and can therefore be a limitation when combining many GWASs. An alternative approach is to bypass the use of individual data and directly impute summary statistics. In our work we compare the performance of summary statistics imputation to genotype imputation. Although we observe a 2- to 5-fold lower RMSE for genotype imputation compared to summary statistics imputation, summary statistics imputation better distinguishes true associations from null results. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of summary statistics imputation by presenting 34 novel height-associated loci, 19 of which were confirmed in UK Biobank. Our study demonstrates that given current reference panels, summary statistics imputation is a very efficient and cost-effective way to identify common or low-frequency trait-associated loci.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are major drug targets and have high potential for drug discovery. The development of a method for measuring the activities of GPCRs is essential for pharmacology and drug screening. However, it is difficult to measure the effects of a drug by monitoring the receptor on the cell surface, and changes in the concentrations of downstream signaling molecules, which depend on signaling pathway selectivity of the receptor, are used as an index of the receptor activity. Here, we show that single-molecule imaging analysis provides an alternative method for assessing ligand effects on GPCR. We monitored the dynamics of the diffusion of metabotropic glutamate receptor 3 (mGluR3), a class C GPCR, under various ligand conditions by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM). The single-molecule tracking analysis demonstrates that changes in the average diffusion coefficient of mGluR3 quantitatively reflect the ligand-dependent activity. Then, we reveal that the diffusion of receptor molecules is altered by the common physiological events associated with GPCRs, including G protein binding or accumulation in clathrin-coated pits, by inhibition experiments and dual-color single-molecule imaging analysis. We also confirm the generality of agonist-induced diffusion change in class A and B GPCRs, demonstrating that the diffusion coefficient is a good index for estimating the ligand effects on many GPCRs regardless of the phylogenetic groups, chemical properties of the ligands, and G protein-coupling selectivity.\\n\\nOne Sentence Summary: Single-molecule imaging for evaluating ligand effects on GPCRs by monitoring the diffusion dynamics on the cell surface.",

Its closer genetic relative, Plasmodium vivax-like, was discovered in African great apes and suggested to have given rise to P. vivax in humans. We generated two newly P. vivax-like reference genomes and 9 additional P. vivax-like genotypes, to unravel the evolutionary history of P. vivax. We showed a clear separation between the two clades, a higher genetic diversity of P. vivax-like parasites in comparison to the P. vivax ones, and the potential existence of two sub-clades of P. vivax-like. We dated the relative split between P. vivax and P. vivax-like as three times shorter than the split between P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtesi and 1.5 times longer than the split between Plasmodium malariae. The sequencing of the P. vivax-like genomes is an undeniable advance in the understanding of P. vivax biology, evolution and emergence in human populations.",

    "abstract": "Mendelian randomization (MR) is widely used to identify causal relationships among heritable traits, but it can be confounded by genetic correlations reflecting shared etiology. We propose a model in which a latent causal variable mediates the genetic correlation between two traits. Under the latent causal variable (LCV) model, trait 1 is fully genetically causal for trait 2 if it is perfectly genetically correlated with the latent causal variable, implying that the entire genetic component of trait 1 is causal for trait 2; it is partially genetically causal for trait 2 if it has a high genetic correlation with the latent variable, implying that part of the genetic component of trait 1 is causal for trait 2. To quantify the degree of partial genetic causality, we define the genetic causality proportion (gcp). We fit this model using mixed fourth moments E([Formula]12) and E([Formula]12) of marginal effect sizes for each trait, exploiting the fact that if trait 1 is causal for trait 2 then SNPs affecting trait 1 (large [Formula]) will have correlated effects on trait 2 (large 12), but not vice versa. We performed simulations under a wide range of genetic architectures and determined that LCV, unlike state-of-the-art MR methods, produced well-calibrated false positive rates and reliable gcp estimates in the presence of genetic correlations and asymmetric genetic architectures; we also determined that LCV is well-powered to detect a causal effect. We applied LCV to GWAS summary statistics for 52 traits (average N=331k), identifying partially or fully genetically causal effects (1% FDR) for 59 pairs of traits, including 30 pairs of traits with high gcp estimates (g[c]p > 0.6). Results consistent with the published literature included genetically causal effects on myocardial infarction (MI) for LDL, triglycerides and BMI. Novel findings included a genetically causal effect of LDL on bone mineral density, consistent with clinical trials of statins in osteoporosis. These results demonstrate that it is possible to distinguish between genetic correlation and causation using genetic data.",

First we developed a method to reconstruct atomic details of DNA structures from a 3-site per nucleotide CG model, which uses a DNA fragment library. Next, for the protein-DNA interface, we referred to the sidechain orientations in the known structure of the target interface when available. The other parts are modeled by existing tools.

Here we use a battery of spectroscopic methods that track different catalytic elements of the kinase domain to show that the ~100-fold activation of the mitotic kinase Aurora A (AurA) by phosphorylation occurs without a population shift to the DFG-In state, and that the activation loop of the activated kinase remains highly dynamic. Instead, molecular dynamics simulations and electron paramagnetic resonance experiments show that phosphorylation profoundly alters the structure and dynamics of the DFG-In subpopulation, leading to activation of the kinase. Kinetics experiments tracking structural transitions during nucleotide binding suggest that a substantial DFG-Out subpopulation is an important feature of activated AurA that evolved to optimize the kinetics of substrate binding and product release.",

    "abstract": "In a landscape of fear, humans are altering key behaviors expressed by wild-living animals, including those related to foraging, reproduction and survival. When exposed to potentially lethal human actions, such as hunting or fishing, fish and wildlife is expected to behaviorally respond by becoming more timid, but proving such responses underwater in the wild has been challenging. Using a rich dataset collected in situ, we provide evidence of spearfishing-induced behavioral effects in five coastal fish species using the flight initiation distance (FID) as a proxy of predator avoidance and boldness. We document that spearfishing promotes a timidity syndrome (i.e., an increase of the average timidity of harvested populations) and that the wariness of preys wariness is influenced by individual size, level of protection offered through marine protected areas and the ability to recognize the risk posed by underwater human predators. In particular, we show that changes in the appearance of the observer (spearfisher vs. snorkeler) modulate the risk perception among the exploited species, and these differences are more evident outside marine protected areas where spearfishing is allowed. We also detected a positive correlation between FID and fish size, with larger specimens (that are more likely targets of spearfishers) revealing larger FID. The behavioral effects were most clearly expressed in the most heavily exploited species and declined towards the less desired and less targeted ones, which may be a result of learning mechanisms and plasticity and/or fisheries-induced evolution of timidity. Our study reveals a trade-off where intensive spearfishing negatively affects future spearfishing success through behavior-based alteration of catchability. Either rotating harvest or implementation of mosaics of protected and exploited areas might be needed to manage spearfishing-induced timidity in exploited stocks.",

    "abstract": "How a system represents information tightly constrains the kinds of problems it can solve. Humans routinely solve problems that appear to require structured representations of stimulus properties and relations. Answering the question of how we acquire these representations has central importance in an account of human cognition. We propose a theory of how a system can learn invariant responses to instances of similarity and relative magnitude, and how structured relational representations can be learned from initially unstructured inputs. We instantiate that theory in the DORA (Discovery of Relations by Analogy) computational framework. The result is a system that learns structured representations of relations from unstructured flat feature vector representations of objects with absolute properties. The resulting representations meet the requirements of human structured relational representations, and the model captures several specific phenomena from the literature on cognitive development. In doing so, we address a major limitation of current accounts of cognition, and provide an existence proof for how structured representations might be learned from experience.",

Gain of HDAC7 function in thymocytes blocks both negative selection and NKT development, diverting these cells into a Tconv-like lineage. Conversely, HDAC7 deletion promotes thymocyte apoptosis and causes aberrant expansion of innate-effector cells. Investigating the mechanisms involved, we found that HDAC7 binds PLZF and modulates PLZF-dependent transcription. Moreover, HDAC7 and many of its transcriptional targets are human risk loci for IBD and PSC, autoimmune diseases that strikingly resemble the disease we observe in HDAC7 gain-of-function in mice. Importantly, reconstitution of iNKT cells in these mice abrogated their disease, suggesting that interaction between the defects in negative selection and iNKT cells caused by altered HDAC7 function can cause tissue-restricted autoimmunity, a finding that may explain the association between HDAC7 and hepatobiliary autoimmunity.",

Gelatin-injected silkworms showed 100% viability in a lethal dose of a Gram-negative bacterial infection within two hours after the gelatin injection. Injection of collagen showed a similar effect. Whereas, an injection of non-gelatin protein (bovine serum albumin) solution did not induce such reaction.

More recently, another RNA-guided CRISPR endonuclease called Cpf1 (also known as Cas12a) was identified and is also being repurposed. Little is known about the kinetics and mechanism of Cpf1 DNA interaction and how sequence mismatches between the DNA target and guide-RNA influence this interaction. We have used single-molecule fluorescence analysis and biochemical assays to characterize DNA interrogation, cleavage, and product release by three Cpf1 orthologues. Our Cpf1 data are consistent with the DNA interrogation mechanism proposed for Cas9, they both bind any DNA in search of PAM (protospacer-adjacent motif) sequences, verifies the target sequence directionally from the PAM-proximal end and rapidly rejects any targets that lack a PAM or that are poorly matched with the guide-RNA. Unlike Cas9, which requires 9 bp for stable binding and ~16 bp for cleavage, Cpf1 requires ~ 17 bp sequence match for both stable binding and cleavage. Unlike Cas9, which does not release the DNA cleavage products, Cpf1 rapidly releases the PAM-distal cleavage product, but not the PAM-proximal product. Solution pH, reducing conditions and 5 guanine in guide-RNA differentially affected different Cpf1 orthologues. Our findings have important implications on Cpf1-based genome engineering and manipulation applications.",

    "abstract": "Using genome-wide mutant fitness assays in diverse bacteria, we identified novel oxidative pathways for the catabolism of 2-deoxy-D-ribose and 2-deoxy-D-ribonate. We propose that deoxyribose is oxidized to deoxyribonate, oxidized to ketodeoxyribonate, and cleaved to acetyl-CoA and glyceryl-CoA. We have genetic evidence for this pathway in three genera of bacteria, and we confirmed the oxidation of deoxyribose to ketodeoxyribonate in vitro. In Pseudomonas simiae, the expression of enzymes in the pathway is induced by deoxyribose or deoxyribonate, while in Paraburkholderia bryophila and in Burkholderia phytofirmans, the pathway proceeds in parallel with the known deoxyribose 5-phosphate aldolase pathway. We identified another oxidative pathway for the catabolism of deoxyribonate, with acyl-CoA intermediates, in Klebsiella michiganensis. Of these four bacteria, only P. simiae relies entirely on an oxidative pathway to consume deoxyribose. The deoxyribose dehydrogenase of P. simiae is either non-specific or evolved recently, as this enzyme is very similar to a novel vanillin dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida that we identified. So, we propose that these oxidative pathways evolved primarily to consume deoxyribonate, which is a waste product of metabolism.\\n\\nImportanceDeoxyribose is one of the building blocks of DNA and is released when cells die and their DNA degrades. We identified a bacterium that can grow with deoxyribose as its sole source of carbon even though its genome does not encode any of the known genes for breaking down deoxyribose. By growing many mutants of this bacterium together on deoxyribose and using DNA sequencing to measure the change in the mutants abundance, we identified multiple protein-coding genes that are required for growth on deoxyribose. Based on the similarity of these proteins to enzymes of known function, we propose a 6-step pathway in which deoxyribose is oxidized and then cleaved. Diverse bacteria use a portion of this pathway to break down a related compound, deoxyribonate, which is a waste product of human metabolism and is present in urine. Our study illustrates the utility of large-scale bacterial genetics to identify previously unknown metabolic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is characterized by mood swings - oscillations between manic and depressive states. The swings (oscillations) mark the length of an episode in a patients mood cycle (period), and can vary from hours to years. The proposed modeling study uses decision making framework to investigate the role of basal ganglia network in generating bipolar oscillations. In this model, the basal ganglia system performs a two-arm bandit task in which one of the arms leads to a positive outcome, while the other leads to a negative outcome. In healthy conditions, the model chooses positive action and avoids negative one, whereas under bipolar conditions, the model exhibits slow oscillations in its choice of positive or negative outcomes, reminiscent of bipolar oscillations. The model is cast at three levels of abstraction: 1) a two-dimensional dynamical system model, 2) a phenomenological basal ganglia model, 3) a detailed network model of basal ganglia. Phase-plane analyses on the simple reduced dynamical system with two variables reveal the essential parameters that generate pathological  bipolar-like oscillations. Phenomenological and network models of the basal ganglia extend that logic, and interpret bipolar oscillations in terms of the activity of dopaminergic and serotonergic projections on the cortico-basal ganglia network dynamics. The networks dysfunction, specifically in terms of reward and risk sensitivity, is shown to be responsible for the pathological bipolar oscillations. The study proposes a computational model that explores the effects of impaired serotonergic neuromodulation on the dynamics of the cortico basal ganglia network, and relates this impairment to abstract mood states (manic and depressive episodes) and oscillations of bipolar disorder.",

    "abstract": "Drug naive animals given a single dose of ethanol show changed responses to subsequent doses, including the development of ethanol tolerance and ethanol preference. These simple forms of behavioral plasticity are due in part to changes in gene expression and neuronal properties. Surprisingly little is known about how ethanol initiates changes in gene expression or what the changes do. Here we demonstrate a role in ethanol plasticity for Hr38, the sole Drosophila homolog of the mammalian Nr4a1/2/3 class of immediate early response transcription factors. Acute ethanol exposure induces transient expression of Hr38 and other immediate early neuronal activity genes. Ethanol activates the Mef2 transcriptional activator to induce Hr38, and the Sirt1 histone/protein deacetylase terminates Hr38 induction. Loss of Hr38 decreases ethanol tolerance and causes precocious but short-lasting ethanol preference. Similarly, reduced Mef2 activity in all neurons or specifically in the mushroom body /{beta} neurons decreases ethanol tolerance; Sirt1 promotes ethanol tolerance in these same neurons. Genetically decreasing Hr38 expression levels in Sirt1 null mutants restores ethanol tolerance, demonstrating that both induction and termination of Hr38 expression are important for behavioral plasticity to proceed. These data demonstrate that Hr38 functions as an immediate early transcription factor that promotes ethanol behavioral plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system and is difficult to diagnose in early stages. Without homeostatic control, urine was reported to have the ability to accumulate early changes in the body. We expect that urinary proteome can reflect early changes in the nervous system. In this study, the early urinary proteome changes in a most employed multiple sclerosis rat model (experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)) were analyzed to explore early urinary candidate biomarkers, and early treatment of methylprednisolone were used to evaluate the therapeutic effect. Compare with controls, twenty-five urinary proteins were altered at day 7 when there were no clinical symptoms and no obvious histological changes. Among them, twenty-three have human homologs and fourteen were reported to be differently expressed in the serum/cerebrospinal fluid/brain tissues of multiple sclerosis patients or animal models. Functional analysis showed that the dysregulated proteins were associated with asparagine degradation, neuroinflammation and lipid metabolism. After the early treatment of methylprednisolone, the incidence of encephalomyelitis in the intervention group was only 1/13. This study demonstrates that urine may be a good source of biomarkers for the early detection of multiple sclerosis and early treatment can significantly delay disease progression. These findings may provide important information for early diagnosis and intervention of multiple sclerosis in the future.",

However, the mechanical and/or physiological considerations that determine duty factor are not well understood. Here, a model is proposed that focuses on the interaction between mechanical and muscle costs to account for duty factor in human gaits. It minimizes the activation costs associated with mechanical work or power demand during muscle contraction (whichever is the more demanding). Empirical observations match model predictions using initial muscle parameters over a range of speeds within gaits. However, a better match is achieved - and a better account for the walk-run transition - with tuned muscle parameters. The tuned model is validated with responses in duty factor to walking at a range of imposed, unnatural step frequencies.",

    "abstract": "Seeding heuristics are the most widely used strategies to speed up sequence alignment in bioinformatics. Such strategies are most successful if they are calibrated, so that the speed-versus-accuracy trade-off can be properly tuned. In the widely used case of read mapping, it has been so far impossible to predict the success rate of competing seeding strategies for lack of a theoretical framework. Here I present an approach to estimate such quantities based on the theory of analytic combinatorics. In a nutshell, the strategy is to specify a combinatorial construction of reads where the seeding heuristic fails, translate this specification into a generating function using formal rules, and finally extract the probabilities of interest from the singularities of the generating function. I use this approach to construct simple estimators of the success rate of the seeding heuristic under different types of sequencing errors. I also show how the analytic combinatorics strategy can be used to compute the associated type I and type II error rates (mapping the read to the wrong location, or being unable to map the read). Finally, I show how analytic combinatorics can be used to estimate average quantities such as the expected number of errors in reads where the seeding heuristic fails. Overall, this work introduces a theoretical and practical framework to find the success rate of seeding heuristics and related problems in bioinformatics.",

Phenotypic profiling of the neurogenic small molecule KHS101 revealed the chemical induction of lethal cellular degradation in molecularly-diverse GBM cells, independent of their tumor subtype, whereas non-cancerous brain cells remained viable. Mechanism-of-action (MOA) studies showed that KHS101 specifically bound and inhibited the mitochondrial chaperone HSPD1. In GBM but not non-cancerous brain cells, KHS101 elicited the aggregation of an enzymatic network that regulates energy metabolism. Compromised glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) resulted in the metabolic energy depletion in KHS101-treated GBM cells. Consistently, KHS101 induced key mitochondrial unfolded protein response factor DDIT3 in vitro and in vivo, and significantly reduced intracranial GBM xenograft tumor growth upon systemic administration, without discernible side effects. These findings suggest targeting of HSPD1-dependent oncometabolic pathways as an anti-GBM therapy.",

    "abstract": "Oil palm expansion threatens biodiverse ecosystems across the tropics. However, palm oil is a widely used and profitable crop, so identifying strategies that mitigate the impact of oil palm expansion on biodiversity is important. Riparian reserves (strips of forest along rivers) are protected in many countries for hydrological reasons and also support species that would not otherwise persist in oil palm. However, management guidelines for riparian zones have been informed by relatively few ecological studies. We assessed how the structural features and landscape context of riparian reserves in Sabah, Malaysia affected dung beetle communities. We also tested the use of flight intercept traps to study movement of dung beetles along linear forest corridors. Overall, dung beetle abundance in riparian reserves was 54% lower than in logged forest areas, but all species observed in the logged forest were found in at least one riparian reserve site and both species richness and diversity increased with reserve width. Distance from a large block of continuous forest affected dung beetle community composition but not species richness, abundance, or functional diversity. The amount of forest cover in the surrounding landscape improved the retention of species within riparian reserves, and increases in vegetation complexity corresponded with higher functional richness and functional dispersion. The flight intercept traps did not indicate that there is net movement of individuals out of logged forest areas into the riparian reserves. The species richness of 30 m reserves (the suggested requirement of reserves in Sabah) was only 10% lower than in logged forest, but our data indicate that riparian reserves of at least 50 - 80 m are needed for species richness and diversity to equal that in nearby logged forest. These findings, particularly if they apply more widely to forest-dependent taxa, should be taken into account when setting policy and sustainability guidelines for oil palm plantations, both in areas undergoing conversion from forest and in existing oil palm plantations where forest restoration is required.",

    "abstract": "AimPhylogeographic studies of temperate forest taxa often infer complex histories involving population subdivision into distinct refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). However, temperate forests may have been broadly distributed in southeastern North America during the LGM. We investigate genome-wide genetic structure in two widespread eastern North America tree species to determine if range expansion from a contiguous area or from genetically isolated refugia better explains the postglacial history of trees and forests from this region.\\n\\nLocationEastern North America (ENA).\\n\\nTaxaBitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis (Wangenh.) K.Koch) and shagbark hickory (Carya ovata (Mill.) K.Koch).\\n\\nMethodsGenetic diversity and differentiation indices were calculated from >1,000 nuclear SNP loci genotyped in ca. 180 individuals per species sampled across ENA. Genetic structure was investigated using principle component analysis and genetic clustering algorithms. As an additional tool for inference, areas of suitable habitat during the LGM were predicted using species distribution models (SDMs).\\n\\nResultsPopulations across all latitudes showed similar levels of genetic diversity. Most genetic variation was weakly differentiated across ENA, with the exception of an outlier population of Carya ovata in Texas. Genetic structure in each species exhibited an isolation-by-distance pattern. SDMs predicted high LGM habitat suitability over much of the southeastern United States.\\n\\nMain conclusionsBoth hickory species likely survived the LGM in a large region of continuous habitat and recolonized northern areas in a single expanding front that encountered few migration barriers. More complex scenarios, such as forest refugia, need not be invoked to explain genetic structure. The genetically distinct Texas population of Carya ovata could represent a separate glacial refugium, but other explanations are possible. Relative to that of other temperate forest regions, the phylogeographic history of ENA may have been exceptionally simple, involving a northward range shift but without well defined refugia.",

Here we examine relationships between local mutation rates and replication timing in three bacterial species whose genomes have multiple chromosomes: Vibrio fischeri, Vibrio cholerae, and Burkholderia cenocepacia. Following five evolution experiments with these bacteria conducted in the near-absence of natural selection, the genomes of clones from each lineage were sequenced and analyzed to identify variation in mutation rates and spectra. In lineages lacking mismatch repair, base-substitution mutation rates vary in a mirrored wave-like pattern on opposing replichores of the large chromosome of V. fischeri and V. cholerae, where concurrently replicated regions experience similar base-substitution mutation rates. The base-substitution mutation rates on the small chromosome are less variable in both species but occur at similar rates as the concurrently replicated regions of the large chromosome. Neither nucleotide composition nor frequency of nucleotide motifs differed among regions experiencing high and low base-substitution rates, which along with the inferred ~800 Kb wave period suggests that the source of the periodicity is not sequence-specific but rather a systematic process related to the cell cycle. These results support the notion that base-substitution mutation rates are likely to vary systematically across many bacterial genomes, which exposes certain genes to elevated deleterious mutational load.",

Such variants are widely dispersed, though concentrated near genes expressed in the brain, and it has been proposed that these SNP associations result from impacts on cell regulatory networks which ultimately affect the expression or function of a modest number of \\\"core\\\" genes. A previous study demonstrated association of some GWAS-significant variants with expression of a number of genes, by examining pair-wise correlations of gene expression with SNP genotypes. The present study used data downloaded from the CommonMind Consortium site, consisting of SNP genotypes and RNAseq expression data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, to examine whether the expression of individual genes or sets of genes correlated with PRS in 207 controls and 209 schizophrenia cases. Although the PRS was significantly associated with phenotype, the correlations with genes and genes sets followed distributions expected by chance. Thus, this analysis failed to demonstrate that the PRS captures a cumulative effect of multiple variants impacting the expression of a small number of genes and it failed to focus attention on a small number of genes of biological relevance. The multiple SNP associations observed in schizophrenia may result from other mechanisms, including effects mediated indirectly through environmental risk factors.",

The aim the study was to explore the response-inhibition performance and the neural correlates of inhibition in Parkinsons disease (PD) patients that varied on self-reported trait impulsivity.\\n\\nMethodsTen cognitively non-impaired patients with PD were recruited. They underwent a neurological evaluation, a neuropsychological assessment and questionnaires on behavioral mood changes. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BISS-11) provided an integrated measure of trait impulsivity. During an fMRI acquisition, each subject was asked to perform a GO-NOGO task. Associations between BOLD response of the whole brain during the response-inhibition task and trait impulsivity were investigated.\\n\\nResultsPatients with greater scores on BIS-11 had greater activation of the bilateral presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA), bilateral anterior insula, right anterior cingulate cortex, and right temporal parietal junction (TPJ) during response-inhibition. Moreover, a significant association between higher impulsivity scores and worse performance was present (p= 0.038).\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest that deficit in inhibitory processes may affect everyday life, causing impulsive conduct, which is generally detrimental for PD patients. The strong association between BIS-11 scores, MPFC, pre-SMA and TPJ suggests that greater engagement of that network was needed to maintain behavioral inhibition in more impulsive PD patients.

Typically, ICA is applied on wide-band EEG (for example 1 to 100 Hz or similar ranges). Since EEG captures the activities of a large number of sources and the fact that number of the components separated by the ICA is limited by the number of the sensors, only the stronger sources (in terms of magnitude and duration) will be detected by the ICA, and the activity of weaker sources will be lost or scattered amongst the stronger components. Because of the 1/f nature of the EEG spectra this biases components to the lower frequency ranges. Here we used a versatile combination of a filter bank, PCA and ICA, calling it multi-band ICA, to both increase the number of the ICA components substantially and improve the SNR of the separated components. Using band-pass filtering we break the original signal mixture into several subbands, and using PCA we reduce the dimensionality of each subband, before applying ICA to a matrix containing all the principal components from each band. Using simulated sources and real EEG of participants, we demonstrate that multi-band ICA is able to outperform the traditional wide-band ICA in terms of both signal-noise ratio of the separated sources and the number of the identified independent components. We successfully separated the gamma-band neuronal components time-locked to a visual stimulus, as well as weak sources which are not detectable by wide-band ICA.",

Epidemiological studies suggest selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment during pregnancy may increase ASD risk in offspring, however it is unclear from these studies whether ASD susceptibility is related to the maternal diagnosis or if treatment poses additional risk. Here, we exposed mouse dams to fluoxetine and characterized the offspring to isolate possible effects of SSRI exposure on ASD-relevant behaviors. We demonstrate social communication and interaction deficits and repetitive behaviors, with corresponding dendritic morphology changes in pertinent brain regions. Also, using a novel application of optical intrinsic signal imaging, we show altered stimulus-evoked cortical response and region-specific decreases in functional connectivity. These findings indicate drug exposure alone is sufficient to induce long-term behavioral, cellular, and hemodynamic-response disruptions in offspring, thus contributing to our understanding of ASD pathogenesis, risk and mechanism, as well as the developmental role of serotonin.",

    "abstract": "While many of our motor skills are acquired through physical practice, we can also learn how to make movements by observing others. For example, individuals can learn how to reach in novel dynamical environments ( force fields, FF) by observing the movements of a tutor. Previous neurophysiology and neuroimaging studies in humans suggest a role for the motor system in motor learning by observing. Here we tested the role of primary motor cortex (M1) in motor learning by observing. We used single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in right hand muscles at rest. MEPs were elicited before and after participants observed either a video adapting her reaches to a FF or a control video showing a tutor performing reaches in an unlearnable FF. We predicted that observing motor learning would increase M1 excitability to a greater extent than observing movements that did not involve learning. We found that observing FF learning increased MEP amplitudes recorded from right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) and right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) muscles. There were no changes in MEP amplitudes for control participants who observed a tutor performing reaches in an unlearnable, randomly varying FF. The observed MEP changes can thus be specifically linked to observing motor learning. These results are consistent with the idea that observing motor learning produces functional changes in M1, or corticospinal networks or both.",

    "abstract": "Anesthetized rodent models are ubiquitous in pre-clinical neuroimaging studies. However, because the associated cerebral morphology and experimental methodology results in a profound negative brain-core temperature differential, cerebral temperature changes during functional activation are likely to be principally driven by local inflow of fresh, core-temperature, blood. This presents a confound to the interpretation of blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data acquired from such models, since this signal is also critically temperature-dependent. Nevertheless, previous investigation on the subject is surprisingly sparse. Here, we address this issue through use of a novel multi-modal methodology in the urethane anesthetized rat. We reveal that sensory stimulation, hypercapnia and recurrent acute seizures induce significant increases in cortical temperature that are preferentially correlated to changes in total hemoglobin concentration, relative to cerebral blood flow and oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, using a phantom-based evaluation of the effect of such temperature changes on the BOLD fMRI signal, we demonstrate a robust inverse relationship between the two. These findings indicate that temperature increases, due to functional hyperemia, should be accounted for to ensure accurate interpretation of BOLD fMRI signals in pre-clinical neuroimaging studies.",

The aim of the experiment is to identify possible contributors to the sudden decrease in honey bee population over the past 60 years, a phenomenon known as Colony Collapse Disorder. Analysis was performed on three sets of bees: the control group which was not in contact with pesticides, the infected dead group which was a set of bees suspected to have died due to neonicotinoids, and the infected alive group which was suspected to be under the influence of neonicotinoids. After dissecting the bee samples and extracting their fat bodies, the chemical composition and protein structures of the samples were analyzed using Mid-Infrared Beamline at the Canadian Light Source. Results from the spectra of bee samples exposed to neonicotinoids demonstrated possible residual pesticide chemicals within fat bodies. Several spectral peaks were also correlated with a possible change in protein secondary structures from primarily {beta}-sheet to -helix within fat bodies of neonicotinoid-affected bees. It is likely that the pesticides caused the growth of additional -helical structures, which is consistent with consequences of the inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) a current pathway of harm of Colony Collapse Disorder as identified in past literature.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative analysis of proteomes across multiple time points, organelles, and perturbations is essential for understanding both fundamental biology and disease states. The development of isobaric tags (e.g. TMT) have enabled the simultaneous measurement of peptide abundances across several different conditions. These multiplexed approaches are promising in principle because of advantages in throughput and measurement quality. However, in practice existing multiplexing approaches suffer from key limitations. In its simple implementation (TMT-MS2), measurements are distorted by chemical noise leading to poor measurement accuracy. The current state-of- the-art (TMT-MS3) addresses this, but requires specialized quadrupole-iontrap-Orbitrap instrumentation. The complement reporter ion approach (TMTc) produces high accuracy measurements and is compatible with many more instruments, like quadrupole-Orbitraps. However, the required deconvolution of the TMTc cluster leads to poor measurement precision. Here, we introduce TMTc+, which adds the modeling of the MS2- isolation step into the deconvolution algorithm. The resulting measurements are comparable in precision to TMT-MS3/MS2. The improved duty cycle, and lower filtering requirements make TMTc+ more sensitive than TMT-MS3 and comparable with TMT-MS2. At the same time, unlike TMT-MS2, TMTc+ is exquisitely able to distinguish signal from chemical noise even outperforming TMT-MS3. Lastly, we compare TMTc+ to quantitative label-free proteomics of total HeLa lysate and find that TMTc+ quantifies 7.8k versus 3.9k proteins in a 5-plex sample. At the same time the median coefficient of variation improves from 13% to 4%. Thus, TMTc+ advances quantitative proteomics by enabling accurate, sensitive, and precise multiplexed experiments on more commonly used instruments.",

    "abstract": "Tobacco is a model plant for genetic transformation, with leaf-disk transformation being the most commonly used method for its transformation. One disadvantage of leaf-disk transformation is obtaining an adequately sized leaf. Cotyledons from young seedlings are considered too small and fragile to use. In an attempt to overcome this drawback, a protocol was developed using toothpicks as a tool to inoculate cotyledons ~2mm in diameter. Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404 hosting two different plasmids (pC35.BNK.2 or pRB140-Bxb1-op) was used for transformation. Fifty-six putative transgenic shoots (T0) were obtained from pC35.BNK.2 transformation. Among them, 38 (68%) grew roots in kanamycin-containing medium. Approximately, 35% of transgenic lines contained a single-copy transgenic locus based on Mendelian inheritance analysis and chi-square ({chi}2) test of T1 seedlings from 17 lines. To simplify the protocol, water-prepared Agrobacterium inoculum was used in pRB140-Bxb1-op (containing gus gene) transformation. This resulted in ~35% putative T0 transgenic lines stained strong blue with GUS histochemical staining assay. Both sets of results demonstrate toothpick inoculation to be an effective approach for Agrobacterium-mediated tobacco cotyledon transformation. This reduces wait time required in existing leaf-disk transformation method using mature leaves. Removal of step requiring submersion of explants in Agrobacterium liquid culture, the protocol also has advantages by minimizing Agrobacterium overgrowth and maintaining explant fitness for later tissue-culturing.",

Those sensors that do exist are either unspecific or fail to capture the temporal or spatial dynamics of neurotransmitter release. DNA-stabilized silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) are a new class of biocompatible, fluorescent nanostructures that have recently been demonstrated to offer promise as biosensors. In this work, we identify two different DNA sequences which form dopamine-sensitive nanoclusters. We demonstrate that each sequence supports two distinct DNA-AgNCs capable of providing specific, ratiometric fluorescent sensing of dopamine concentration in vitro. DNA-Ag nanoclusters therefore offer a novel, low-cost approach to quantification of dopamine, creating the potential for real-time monitoring in vivo.",

Emerging evidence suggests that the number, affinity and organization of sites play important roles in regulating enhancer output and ultimately gene expression. Here, we investigate how the cis-regulatory logic of a tissue-specific CRE responsible for even-skipped (eve) induction during cardiogenesis organizes the competing inputs of two ETS members, the activator Pointed (Pnt) and the repressor Yan. Using a combination of reporter gene assays and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, we show that Yan and Pnt have distinct preferences for affinity of sites. Not only does Yan prefer high affinity sites, but a tandem pair of such sites is necessary and sufficient for Yan to tune Eve expression levels in newly specified cardioblasts and to block ectopic Eve induction and cell fate specification in surrounding progenitors. Mechanistically, the cooperative Yan recruitment promoted by this conserved high affinity ETS pair not only biases Yan-Pnt competition at the specific CRE, but also organizes Yan repressive complexes in 3D across the eve locus. Taken together our results uncover a novel mechanism by which differential interpretation of CRE syntax by a competing repressor-activator pair can confer both specificity and robustness to developmental transitions.",

Regulation of its thickness, although well studied in rounded cells, is less explored in well-spread cells. In this paper, we quantify the variations in thickness and study the contribution of actin polymerization, myosin II activity and spread area of cells. We report an increase in cortex thickness and its variations on disrupting actin network by actin depolymerizing agents or reducing contractility by inhibiting motor activity of myosin II. On spread area reduction by substrate micropatterning, we find reduced cell volume and increased mean & variability of thickness. To validate, we follow cells through de-adhesion with EDTA. The thickness of cortex increases (and oscillates) while the volume of cells reduces with 5-15 mins timescales. Moreover, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging reveals stress fibre dissolution and events of their buckling along with a growing population of micron-sized mobile filaments. We believe that the cytoskeleton responds to the loss of adhesion by contracting and fragmenting, hence leading to cortex thickening. Limiting volume reduction does not suppress cortex thickening on de-adhesion, suggesting that decreased traction stress may be primarily responsible for the cortex thickening.",

    "abstract": "Stoichiometric balance, or dosage balance, implies that proteins that are subunits of obligate complexes (e.g. the ribosome) should have copy numbers expressed to match their stoichiometry in that complex. Establishing balance (or imbalance) is an important tool for inferring subunit function and assembly bottlenecks. We show here that these correlations in protein copy numbers can extend beyond complex subunits to larger protein-protein interactions networks (PPIN) involving a range of reversible binding interactions. We develop a simple method for quantifying balance in any interface-resolved PPINs based on network structure and experimentally observed protein copy numbers. By analyzing such a network for the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) system in yeast, we found that the real protein copy numbers were significantly more balanced in relation to their binding partners compared to randomly sampled sets of yeast copy numbers. The observed balance is not perfect, highlighting both under and overexpressed proteins. We evaluate the potential cost and benefits of imbalance using two criteria. First, a potential cost to imbalance is that leftover proteins without remaining functional partners are free to misinteract. We systematically quantify how this misinteraction cost is most dangerous for strong-binding protein interactions and for network topologies observed in biological PPINs. Second, a more direct consequence of imbalance is that the formation of specific functional complexes depends on relative copy numbers. We therefore construct simple kinetic models of two sub-networks in the CME network to assess multi-protein assembly of the ARP2/3 complex and a minimal, nine-protein clathrin-coated vesicle forming module. We find that the observed, imperfectly balanced copy numbers are less effective than balanced copy numbers in producing fast and complete multi-protein assemblies. However, we speculate that strategic imbalance in the vesicle forming module allows cells to tune where endocytosis occurs, providing sensitive control over cargo uptake via clathrin-coated vesicles.",

To this end, four cultivars (Incentive, Vision, Harper and Quartz) were grown in field plots with different levels of V. longisporum disease pressure at different locations over two consecutive years. Whereas Incentive and Vision developed relatively few stem striping symptoms, Harper and especially Quartz showed severe symptoms during these field experiments. Furthermore, higher inoculum levels induced more severe symptoms in these cultivars. Intriguingly, significant yield reductions upon V. longisporum infection only occurred in a single field trial on all tested oilseed rape cultivars. Thus we conclude that Verticillium stem striping does not consistently impact oilseed rape yield, despite the occurrence of abundant disease symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Clownfishes (or anemonefishes) form an iconic group of coral reef fishes, particularly known for their mutualistic interaction with sea anemones. They are characterized by particular life history traits, such as a complex social structure and mating system involving sequential hermaphroditism, coupled with an exceptionally long lifespan. Additionally, clownfishes are considered to be one of the rare group to have experienced an adaptive radiation in the marine environment.\\n\\nHere, we assembled and annotated the first genome of a clownfish species, the tomato clownfish (Amphiprion frenatus). We obtained a total of 17,801 assembled scaffolds, containing a total of 26,917 genes. The completeness of the assembly and annotation was satisfying, with 96.5% of the Actinopterygii BUSCOs (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs) being retrieved in A. frenatus assembly. The quality of the resulting assembly is comparable to other bony fish assemblies.\\n\\nThis resource is valuable for the advancing of studies of the particular life-history traits of clownfishes, as well as being useful for population genetic studies and the development of new phylogenetic markers. It will also open the way to comparative genomics. Indeed, future genomic comparison among closely related fishes may provide means to identify genes related to the unique adaptations to different sea anemone hosts, as well as better characterize the genomic signatures of an adaptive radiation.",

    "abstract": "Oscillatory coupling has been implicated in the representation and in the processing of information in the brain. Specific hypotheses suggest that oscillatory coupling may be relevant for the temporal coding of information but to which extent this may translate to conscious timing is unknown. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the temporal precision of self-generated timed actions may be controlled by phase-amplitude coupling (PAC). Using a timing task, we show the existence of significant alpha-beta (-{beta}) PAC, robust at the individual level, and specific to temporal production. Second, an increase in the strength of -{beta} PAC was associated with a smaller variance in time production, i.e. an increased precision in timing, but there was no correlation with the duration of the produced interval. Our results suggest an active role for -{beta} coupling in maintaining the precision of the endogenous temporal goal during time production: specifically,  oscillations may maintain the content of current cognitive states, thus securing the endogenous temporal code for duration estimation instantiated in {beta} band. Oscillatory multiplexing may thus index the variance of neuronal computations, which translates into the precision of behavioral performance.",
