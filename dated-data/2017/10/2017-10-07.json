    "abstract": "Kinases play a critical role in many cellular signaling pathways and are dysregulated in a number of diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Since the FDA approval of imatinib in 2001, therapeutics targeting kinases now account for roughly 50% of current cancer drug discovery efforts. The ability to explore human kinase biochemistry, biophysics, and structural biology in the laboratory is essential to making rapid progress in understanding kinase regulation, designing selective inhibitors, and studying the emergence of drug resistance. While insect and mammalian expression systems are frequently used for the expression of human kinases, bacterial expression systems are superior in terms of simplicity and cost-effectiveness but have historically struggled with human kinase expression. Following the discovery that phosphatase coexpression could produce high yields of Src and Abl kinase domains in bacterial expression systems, we have generated a library of 52 His-tagged human kinase domain constructs that express above 2 {micro}g/mL culture in a simple automated bacterial expression system utilizing phosphatase coexpression (YopH for Tyr kinases, Lambda for Ser/Thr kinases). Here, we report a structural bioinformatics approach to identify kinase domain constructs previously expressed in bacteria likely to express well in a simple high-throughput protocol, experiments demonstrating our simple construct selection strategy selects constructs with good expression yields in a test of 84 potential kinase domain boundaries for Abl, and yields from a high-throughput expression screen of 96 human kinase constructs. Using a fluorescence-based thermostability assay and a fluorescent ATP-competitive inhibitor, we show that the highest-expressing kinases are folded and have well-formed ATP binding sites. We also demonstrate how the resulting expressing constructs can be used for the biophysical and biochemical study of clinical mutations by engineering a panel of 48 Src mutations and 46 Abl mutations via single-primer mutagenesis and screening the resulting library for expression yields. The wild-type kinase construct library is available publicly via Addgene, and should prove to be of high utility for experiments focused on drug discovery and the emergence of drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating how ecological and evolutionary mechanisms interact to produce and maintain biodiversity is a fundamental problem in evolutionary ecology. We investigate this issue by focusing on how physiological evolution affects performance and species coexistence along the thermal niche axis in replicated radiations of Anolis lizards, groups best known for resource partitioning based on morphological divergence. We find repeated divergence in thermal physiology within these radiations, and that this divergence significantly affects performance within natural thermal environments. Morphologically similar species that co-occur invariably differ in their thermal physiology, providing evidence that physiological divergence facilitates species co-existence within anole communities. Despite repeated divergence in traits of demonstrable ecological importance, phylogenetic comparative analyses indicate that physiological traits have evolved more slowly than key morphological traits related to the structural niche. Phylogenetic analyses also reveal that physiological divergence is correlated with divergence in broad-scale habitat climatic features commonly used to estimate thermal niche evolution, but that the latter incompletely predicts variation in the former. We provide comprehensive evidence for repeated adaptive evolution of physiological divergence within Anolis adaptive radiations, including the complementary roles of physiological and morphological divergence in promoting community-level diversity. We recommend greater integration of performance-based traits into analyses of climatic niche evolution, as they facilitate a more complete understanding of the phenotypic and ecological consequences of climatic divergence.",

    "abstract": "In Arabidopsis, development during flowering is coordinated by transport of the hormone auxin mediated by polar-localized PIN-FORMED1 (AtPIN1). However Arabidopsis has lost a PIN clade sister to AtPIN1, Sister-of-PIN1 (SoPIN1), which is conserved in flowering plants. We previously proposed that the AtPIN1 organ initiation and vein patterning functions are split between the SoPIN1 and PIN1 clades in grasses. Here we show that in the grass Brachypodium sopin1 mutants have organ initiation defects similar to Arabidopsis atpin1, while loss of PIN1 function in Brachypodium has little effect on organ initiation but alters stem growth. Heterologous expression of Brachypodium SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis provides further evidence of functional specificity. SoPIN1 but not PIN1b can mediate flower formation in null atpin1 mutants, although both can complement a missense allele. The behavior of SoPIN1 and PIN1b in Arabidopsis illustrates how membrane and tissue-level accumulation, transport activity, and interaction contribute to PIN functional specificity.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical reactions within individual cells result from the interactions of molecules, often in small numbers. Consequently, the inherent stochasticity of binding and diffusion processes generate noise along the cascade that leads to the synthesis of a protein from its encoding gene. As a result, isogenic cell populations display phenotypic variability even in homogeneous environments. The extent and consequences of this stochastic gene expression have only recently been assessed on a genome-wide scale, in particular owing to the advent of single cell transcriptomics. However, the evolutionary forces shaping this stochasticity have yet to be unraveled. We took advantage of two recently published data sets of the single-cell transcriptome of the domestic mouse Mus musculus in order to characterize the effect of natural selection on gene-specific transcriptional stochasticity. We showed that noise levels in the mRNA distributions (a.k.a. transcriptional noise) significantly correlate with three-dimensional nuclear domain organization, evolutionary constraint on the encoded protein and gene age. The position of the encoded protein in biological pathways, however, is the main factor that explains observed levels of transcriptional noise, in agreement with models of noise propagation within gene networks. Because transcriptional noise is under widespread selection, we argue that it constitutes an important component of the phenotype and that variance of expression is a potential target of adaptation. Stochastic gene expression should therefore be considered together with mean expression level in functional and evolutionary studies of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Predation after release is one of the major concerns of hatchery fish conservation and propagation. However, the relationship among the size of hatchery fish, the predator species, and their behaviors in natural environments is largely unknown. To understand the relationship, we conducted predation experiments in outdoor tanks and a semi-natural stream with exposure to local predators. Two different ranges of fork lengths of masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou) were examined as prey sizes. Camera trap data showed that grey herons (Ardea cinerea) were the primary predator animal in the system, and that most herons utilized shallow areas in the morning or evening. Increasing the density of stocked salmon brought in more grey herons. More importantly, predation by grey herons resulted in the survival rate of larger salmon being significantly lower than that of the smaller salmon. Our results suggest that it is important to understand local predators, adjust the optimum body size of hatchery fish at release, and choose the appropriate stocking site and time of day for maximizing the effectiveness of fish stocking.",

To determine whether late heterochronic shifts underlie derived floral morphologies within Jaltomata (Solanaceae) - a genus whose species have extensive and recently evolved floral diversity - we compared floral development of four diverse species (including an ambiguously ancestral or secondarily derived rotate, two putatively independently evolved campanulate, and a tubular morph) to the ancestral rotate floral form, as well as to an outgroup that shares this ancestral floral morphology.\\n\\nResultsWe determined that early floral development (<1 mm bud diameter, corresponding to completion of organ whorl initiation) is very similar among all species, but that different mature floral forms are distinguishable by mid-development (>1 mm diameters) due to differential growth acceleration of corolla traits. Floral ontogeny among similar mature rotate forms remains comparable until late stages, while somewhat different patterns of organ growth are found between species with similar campanulate forms.\\n\\nConclusionsOur data suggest shared floral patterning during early-stage development, but that different heterochronic shifts during mid- and late-stage development contributes to divergent floral traits. Heterochrony thus appears to have been important in the rapid and repeated diversification of Jaltomata flowers.",

At present, both the extraction of data and methods for analyses are frequently designed to work with a single snapshot of a patients record. Health care providers often perform and record actions in small batches over time. By extracting these care events, a sequence can be formed providing a trajectory for a patients interactions with the health care system. These care events also offer a basic heuristic for the level of attention a patient receives from health care providers. We show that is possible to learn meaningful embeddings from these care events using two deep learning techniques, unsupervised autoencoders and long short-term memory networks.

    "abstract": "We introduce a new conceptual framework and a model-based interventional calculus to steer, manipulate, and reconstruct the dynamics and generating mechanisms of non-linear dynamical systems from partial and disordered observations based on the contributions of each of the systems, by exploiting first principles from the theory of computability and algorithmic information. This calculus entails finding and applying controlled interventions to an evolving object to estimate how its algorithmic information content is affected in terms of positive or negative shifts towards and away from randomness in connection to causation. The approach is an alternative to statistical approaches for inferring causal relationships and formulating theoretical expectations from perturbation analysis. We find that the algorithmic information landscape of a system runs parallel to its dynamic attractor landscape, affording an avenue for moving systems on one plane so they can be controlled on the other plane. Based on these methods, we advance tools for reprogramming a system that do not require full knowledge or access to the systems actual kinetic equations or to probability distributions. This new approach yields a suite of universal parameter-free algorithms of wide applicability, ranging from the discovery of causality, dimension reduction, feature selection, model generation, a maximal algorithmic-randomness principle and a systems (re)programmability index. We apply these methods to static (e.coli Transcription Factor network) and to evolving genetic regulatory networks (differentiating naive from Th17 cells, and the CellNet database). We highlight their ability to pinpoint key elements (genes) related to cell function and cell development, conforming to biological knowledge from experimentally validated data and the literature, and demonstrate how the method can reshape a systems dynamics in a controlled manner through algorithmic causal mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Reef-building corals are highly sensitive to rising ocean temperatures, and substantial adaptation will be required for animals and the ecosystems they support to persist in changing ocean conditions. Genetic variation that might support adaptive responses has been measured in larval stages of some corals, but these estimates remain unavailable for adult corals and the functional basis of this variation remains unclear. In this study, we focused on the potential for adaptation in Orbicella faveolata, a dominant reef-builder in the Caribbean. We conducted thermal stress experiments using corals collected from natural populations in Bocas del Toro, Panama, and used multilocus SNP genotypes to estimate genetic relatedness among samples. This allowed us to estimate narrow-sense heritability of variation in bleaching responses, revealing that this variation was highly heritable (h2=0.91). This estimate suggests substantial potential for adaptive responses to warming by natural populations of O. faveolata in this region. To investigate the functional basis for this variation, we applied genomic and transcriptomic approaches enabled by expanding sequence resources for this species. We used a genetic linkage map we have recently developed to map associations between SNP genotypes and bleaching responses, and identified four genetic markers associated with bleaching. We also profiled gene expression in corals with contrasting bleaching phenotypes, uncovering substantial variation in responses to thermal stress between heat-tolerant and heat-susceptible corals. Integrating these genomic and transcriptomic data with quantitative genetic analysis provides a new perspective on the mechanistic basis for thermal tolerance phenotypes and the potential for adaptation to rising ocean temperatures.",

Here, we test the fundamental role of midbrain dopamine neurons in conferring predictive or motivational properties to cues, independent of external rewards. We demonstrate that phasic optogenetic excitation of dopamine neurons throughout the midbrain, when presented in temporal association with discrete sensory cues, is sufficient to instantiate those cues as conditioned stimuli that subsequently both evoke dopamine neuron activity on their own, and elicit cue-locked conditioned behaviors. Critically, we identify highly parcellated behavioral functions for dopamine neuron subpopulations projecting to discrete regions of striatum, revealing dissociable mesostriatal systems for the generation of incentive value and movement invigoration. These results show that dopamine neurons orchestrate Pavlovian conditioning via functionally heterogeneous, circuit-specific motivational signals to shape cue-controlled behavior.",

    "abstract": "We construct genomic predictors for heritable and extremely complex human quantitative traits (height, heel bone density, and educational attainment) using modern methods in high dimensional statistics (i.e., machine learning). Replication tests show that these predictors capture, respectively, ~40, 20, and 9 percent of total variance for the three traits. For example, predicted heights correlate ~0.65 with actual height; actual heights of most individuals in validation samples are within a few cm of the prediction. The variance captured for height is comparable to the estimated SNP heritability from GCTA (GREML) analysis, and seems to be close to its asymptotic value (i.e., as sample size goes to infinity), suggesting that we have captured most of the heritability for the SNPs used. Thus, our results resolve the common SNP portion of the \\\"missing heritability\\\" problem - i.e., the gap between prediction R-squared and SNP heritability. The ~20k activated SNPs in our height predictor reveal the genetic architecture of human height, at least for common SNPs. Our primary dataset is the UK Biobank cohort, comprised of almost 500k individual genotypes with multiple phenotypes. We also use other datasets and SNPs found in earlier GWAS for out-of-sample validation of our results.",

Although regional physiological differences are common in multi-center clinical studies, the presence of significant differences in the urinary proteomes of individuals from different regions remains unknown. In this study, morning urine samples were collected from healthy urban residents in three regions of China and urinary proteins were preserved using a membrane-based method (Urimem). The urine proteomes of 27 normal samples were analyzed using LC-MS/MS and compared among the three regions. We identified 1,898 proteins from Urimem samples using label-free proteome quantification, of which 62 urine proteins were differentially expressed among the three regions. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that inter-regional differences caused less significant changes in the urine proteome than inter-sex differences. Of the 62 differentially expressed proteins, 10 have been reported to be disease biomarkers in previous clinical studies. Urimem facilitates urinary protein storage for large-scale urine sample collection, and thus accelerates biobank development and urine biomarker studies employing proteomics approaches. Regional differences are a confounding factor influencing the urine proteome and should be considered in future multi-center biomarker studies.",

    "abstract": "Meristems contain groups of indeterminate stem cells that are critical for organ initiation throughout plant development. The shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintains itself and initiates all shoot organs, such as leaves, floral organs and axillary branch meristems. Development and balanced proliferation of the SAM is regulated by a feedback loop between CLAVATA (CLV) and WUSCHEL (WUS) signaling. CLV signaling is initiated by secretion of the CLV3 peptide ligand, which is perceived directly or indirectly by a number of Leucine-Rich-Repeat (LRR) receptor-like kinases, including CLV1 and BARELY ANY MERISTEM (BAM) 1-3, and RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 2 (RPK2), as well as the receptor-like protein CLV2 in a complex with the CORYNE (CRN) pseudokinase. However, CLV2, and its maize ortholog FASCIATED EAR2 (FEA2) appear to function in signaling by several related CLV3/EMBRYO-SURROUNDING REGION (CLE) peptide ligands, including CLV3. Nevertheless, it remains unknown how CLV2 or FEA2 transmit specific signals from distinct CLE peptides. Here we show that FEA2 is involved in signaling from at least 2 distinct CLE peptides, ZmCLE7, a maize CLV3 ortholog, and ZmFON2-LIKE CLE PROTEIN1 (ZmFCP1), a newly identified CLE peptide functioning in SAM regulation. Signaling from these 2 different CLE peptides appears to be transmitted through 2 different candidate downstream effectors, COMPACT PLANT2 (CT2), the alpha subunit of the maize heterotrimeric G protein, and maize CRN. Our data provide a novel framework to understand how diverse signaling peptides can activate different downstream pathways through common receptor proteins.",

Similarly, the brain must represent the arms inertia to predict the arms movements elicited by commands impressed upon the muscles. Here, we present evidence suggesting that the integration of sensory information leading to the representation of the arms inertia does not take place continuously in time but only at discrete transient events, in which kinetic energy is exchanged between the arm and the environment. We used a visuomotor delay to induce crossmodal variations in state feedback and uncovered that the difference between visual and proprioceptive velocity estimations at isolated collision events was compensated by a change in the representation of arm inertia. The compensation maintained an invariant estimate across modalities of the expected energy exchange with the environment. This invariance captures different types of dysmetria observed across individuals following prolonged exposure to a fixed intermodal temporal perturbation and provides a new interpretation for cerebellar ataxia.",

    "abstract": "The plasma membrane and the underlying cytoskeletal cortex constitute active platforms for a variety of cellular processes. Recent work has shown that the remodeling acto-myosin network modifies local membrane organization, but the molecular details are only partly understood due to difficulties with experimentally accessing the relevant time and length scales. Here, we use interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy to investigate a minimal acto-myosin network linked to a supported lipid bilayer membrane. Using the magnitude of the interferometric contrast, which is proportional to molecular mass, and fast acquisition rates, we detect, and image individual membrane attached actin filaments diffusing within the acto-myosin network and follow individual myosin II filament dynamics. We quantify myosin II filament dwell times and processivity as a function of ATP concentration, providing evidence for the predicted ensemble behavior of myosin head domains. Our results show how decreasing ATP concentrations lead to both increasing dwell times of individual myosin II filaments and a global change from a remodeling to a contractile state of the acto-myosin network.\n\nStatement of SignificanceHere, we show that interferometric scattering microscopy in combination with single particle tracking enables label-free, high contrast imaging of filament dynamics on surfaces, while distinguishing different species based on their mass. These results significantly broaden the available toolkit, and associated capabilities of researchers studying dynamics of biological machines at interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Evolution of cis-properties (such as enhancers) often plays an important role in the production of diverse morphology. However, a mechanistic understanding is often limited by the absence of methods to study enhancers in species outside of established model systems. Here, we sought to establish methods to identify and test enhancer activity in the red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. To identify possible enhancer regions, we first obtained genome-wide chromatin profiles from various tissues and stages of Tribolium via FAIRE (Formaldehyde Assisted Isolation of Regulatory Elements)-sequencing. Comparison of these profiles revealed a distinct set of open chromatin regions in each tissue and stage. Second, we established the first reporter assay system that works in both Drosophila and Tribolium, using nubbin in the wing and hunchback in the embryo as case studies. Together, these advances will be useful to study the evolution of cis-language and morphological diversity in Tribolium and other insects.",

    "abstract": "A key event in vertebrate heart development is the timely addition of second heart field (SHF) progenitor cells to the poles of the heart tube. This accretion process must occur to the proper extent to prevent a spectrum of congenital heart defects (CHDs). However, the factors that regulate this critical process are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that Hey2, a bHLH transcriptional repressor, restricts SHF progenitor accretion to the zebrafish heart. hey2 expression demarcated a distinct domain within the cardiac progenitor population. In the absence of Hey2 function an increase in myocardial cell number and SHF progenitors was observed. We found that Hey2 limited proliferation of SHF-derived cardiomyocytes in a cell-autonomous manner, prior to heart tube formation, and further restricted the developmental window over which SHF progenitors were deployed to the heart. Taken together, our data suggests a role for Hey2 in controlling the proliferative capacity and cardiac contribution of late-differentiating cardiac progenitors.",

In this study, we investigate the dynamics of rDNA loci during aging in the Drosophila male germline stem cell (GSC) lineage, and show that rDNA copy number decreases during aging. Our study further reveals that this age-dependent decrease in rDNA copy number is heritable from generation to generation, yet GSCs in animals that inherit reduced rDNA copy number are capable of recovering normal rDNA copy number. Based on these findings, we propose that rDNA loci are dynamic genetic elements, where rDNA copy number changes dynamically yet is maintained through a recovery mechanism in the germline.",

Despite the critical role that environmental availability of Symbiodinium plays in the potential for corals to acclimate and adapt to changing environments, little is known about the diversity of free-living Symbiodinium communities and how variation in these communities influences uptake and in hospite communities in juvenile corals. Here we characterize Symbiodinium community diversity in sediment samples collected from eight reefs representing latitudinal and cross-shelf variation in water quality and temperature regimes. Sediment-associated Symbiodinium communities were then compared to in hospite communities acquired by A. tenuis and A. millepora juveniles following 11 - 145 days of experimental exposure to sediments from each of the reefs. Communities associated with juveniles and sediments differed substantially, with sediments harbouring four times more unique OTUs than juveniles (1125 OTUs vs. 271). Moreover, only 10.6% of these OTUs were shared between juveniles and sediments, indicating selective uptake by acroporid juveniles. The diversity and abundance of Symbiodinium types differed among sediment samples from different temperature and water quality environments. Symbiodinium communities acquired by juveniles also differed among the sediment treatments, despite juveniles having similar parentage. Moreover, Symbiodinium communities displayed different rates of infection, mortality, and photochemical efficiencies. This study demonstrates that the biogeography of free-living Symbiodinium types found within sediment reservoirs follows patterns along latitudinal and water quality environmental gradients on the Great Barrier Reef. We also demonstrate a bipartite strategy for Symbiodinium uptake by juvenile corals of two horizontally-transmitting acroporid species, whereby uptake is selective within the constraints of environmental availability.",

    "abstract": "When a free-living bacterium transitions to a host-beneficial endosymbiotic lifestyle, it almost invariably loses a large fraction of its genome [1, 2]. The resulting small genomes often become unusually stable in size, structure, and coding capacity [3-5]. Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola (Hodgkinia), a bacterial endosymbiont of cicadas, sometimes exemplifies this genomic stability. The Hodgkinia genome has remained completely co-linear in some cicadas diverged by tens of millions of years [6, 7]. But in the long-lived periodical cicada Magicicada tredecim, the Hodgkinia genome has split into dozens of tiny, gene-sparse genomic circles that sometimes reside in distinct Hodgkinia cells [8]. Previous data suggested that other Magicicada species harbor similarly complex Hodgkinia populations, but the timing, number of origins, and outcomes of the splitting process were unknown. Here, by sequencing Hodgkinia metagenomes from the remaining six Magicicada species and two sister species, we show that all Magicicada species harbor Hodgkinia populations of at least twenty genomic circles each. We find little synteny among the 256 Hodgkinia circles analyzed except between the most closely related species. Individual gene phylogenies show that Hodgkinia first split in the common ancestor of Magicicada and its closest known relatives, but that most splitting has occurred within Magicicada and has given rise to highly variable Hodgkinia gene dosages between cicada species. These data show that Hodgkinia genome degradation has proceeded down different paths in different Magicicada species, and support a model of genomic degradation that is stochastic in outcome and likely nonadaptive for the host. These patterns mirror the genomic instability seen in some mitochondria.",

Surrogate sire technology allows the creation of males that lack their own germline cells, but have transplanted spermatogonial stem cells from donor males. With this technology, a single elite male donor could give rise to huge numbers of progeny, potentially as much as all the production animals in a particular time period.\\n\\nOne hundred replicates of various scenarios were performed. Scenarios followed a common overall structure but differed in the strategy used to identify elite donors and how these donors were used in the product development part.\\n\\nThe results of this study showed that using surrogate sire technology would significantly increase the genetic merit of commercial sires, by as much as 6.5 to 9.2 years worth of genetic gain compared to a conventional breeding program. The simulations suggested that a strategy involving three stages (an initial genomic test followed by two subsequent progeny tests) was the most effective of all the strategies tested.\\n\\nThe use of one or a handful of elite donors to generate the production animals would be very different to current practice. While the results demonstrate the great potential of surrogate sire technology there are considerable risks but also other opportunities. Practical implementation of surrogate sire technology would need to account for these.",

    "abstract": "Study Objectives: Higher caffeine consumption has been linked to poorer sleep and insomnia complaints. We investigated whether these observational associations are the result of genetic risk factors influencing both caffeine consumption and poorer sleep, and/or whether they reflect (possibly bidirectional) causal effects. Methods: Summary-level data were available from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on caffeine consumption (n=91,462), sleep duration, and chronotype (i.e., being a  morning versus an  evening person) (both n=128,266), and insomnia complaints (n=113,006). Linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression was used to calculate genetic correlations, reflecting the extent to which genetic variants influencing caffeine consumption and sleep behaviours overlap. Causal effects were tested with bidirectional, two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR), an instrumental variable approach that utilizes genetic variants robustly associated with an exposure variable as an instrument to test causal effects. Estimates from individual genetic variants were combined using inverse-variance weighted meta-analysis, weighted median regression and MR Egger regression methods. Results: There was no clear evidence for genetic correlation between caffeine consumption and sleep duration (rg=0.000, p=0.998), chronotype (rg=0.086, p=0.192) or insomnia (rg=-0.034, p=0.700). Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses did not support causal effects from caffeine consumption to sleep behaviours, or the other way around. Conclusions: We found no evidence in support of genetic correlation or causal effects between caffeine consumption and sleep. While caffeine may have acute effects on sleep when taken shortly before habitual bedtime, our findings suggest that a more sustained pattern of high caffeine consumption is likely associated with poorer sleep through shared environmental factors.",

Here we report unexpected roles for glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), particularly GSTM1, in astrocyte activation and astrocyte-mediated enhancement of microglia activation during brain inflammation. We found that astrocyte-specific silencing of GSTM1 expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) attenuated microglia activation in brain inflammation induced by systemic injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Gstm1 silencing in astrocytes also attenuated LPS-induced TNF- production by microglia in co-culture. In astrocytes, GSTM1 was required for the activation of nuclear factor-{kappa}B (NF-{kappa}B) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) and the production of pro-inflammatory mediators previously implicated in microglia activation, such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF/CSF2) and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2). Similar results were also obtained with GSTT2 both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our study identified a critical role for GSTs in priming astrocytes and enhancing microglia activation during brain inflammation.\\n\\nSignificant StatementAstrocytes and microglia play critical roles in brain inflammation, but it is not fully understood how astrocytes regulate microglia activation. Here we report a novel mechanism by which glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), the enzymes for phase II detoxification of xenobiotic metabolism, in astrocytes control microglia activation during brain inflammation. We found that GSTs, particularly GSTM1, regulate the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators via the activation of NF-{kappa}B and JNK in astrocytes. Our studies provide evidence that GST enzymes are active players in brain inflammation and can be targeted to regulate microglia activation.",

Although microfluidic technology can miniaturise AST, the high dynamic range of pathogen density found in clinical urine samples makes direct testing of clinical samples - rather than testing colonies from overnight agar plates - extremely challenging. We evaluated for the first time how pathogen concentration in urine affects microfluidic AST using a novel microplate-compatible high-throughput microfluidic AST system termed \\\"Lab-on-a-Comb\\\". When tested with clinical E. coli isolates at standardised density, these devices gave identical antibiotic susceptibility profiles to standard disc diffusion and microtitre plate tests. Bacterial detection directly in synthetic urine spiked with clinical E. coli UTI isolates was possible over a very large dynamic range of starting cell densities, from 103 - 108 CFU/mL which covers the range of pathogen cell densities found in patient urine. The lowest cell density where cell growth was reproducibly detected optically was 9.6x102 CFU/mL, corresponding to one single CFU detected in a 1 L microcapillary-an unprecedented level of sensitivity. Cell growth kinetics followed a simple Monod model with fast growth limited by the substrate availability and an estimated doubling time of 24.5 min, indicating optimal E. coli growth conditions within these microfluidic devices. There was a trade-off between sensitivity and speed of detection, with 105 CFU/mL detection possible within 2h, but 6h incubation required at 103 CFU/mL.",

These pathogens share several eukaryotic-like kinases that present antibiotic development opportunities. We used computational modelling to identify human kinase inhibitors that could be repurposed towards bacteria as part of a novel combination therapy. The computational model suggested a family of inhibitors, the imidazopyridine aminofurazans (IPAs), bind PknB with high affinity. We found that these inhibitors biochemically inhibit PknB, with potency roughly following the predicted models. A novel x-ray structure confirmed that the inhibitors bind as predicted and made favorable protein contacts with the target. These inhibitors also have antimicrobial activity towards Mycobacteria and Nocardia, and normally ineffective {beta}-lactams can potentiate IPAs to more efficiently inhibit growth of these pathogens.

Cortical hierarchy is conventionally informed by invasive measurements of long-range projections, creating the need for a principled proxy measure of hierarchy in humans. Moreover, cortex exhibits marked interareal variation in patterns of gene expression, yet organizing principles of its transcriptional architecture remain unclear. We hypothesized that functional specialization of human cortical microcircuitry involves hierarchical gradients of gene expression. We found that a noninvasive neuroimaging measure, the MRI-derived myelin map, reliably indexes hierarchy and closely resembles the dominant pattern of transcriptomic variation across human cortex. We found strong hierarchical gradients in expression profiles of genes related to microcircuit function and neuropsychiatric disorders. Our findings suggest that hierarchy defines an axis shared by the transcriptomic and anatomical architectures of human cortex, and that hierarchical gradients of microscale properties contribute to macroscale specialization of cortical function.",

Here we show that coinciding with eye opening, the strength of unitary inhibitory postsynaptic currents (uIPSCs) from somatostatin-expressing interneurons (SST-INs) to nearby excitatory neurons, but not interneurons, sharply decreases in layer 2/3 of the mouse visual cortex. In contrast, the strength of uIPSCs from fast-spiking interneurons (FS-INs) to excitatory neurons significantly increases during eye opening. More importantly, these developmental changes can be prevented by dark rearing or binocular lid suture, and reproduced by artificial opening of sutured lids. Mechanistically, this differential maturation of synaptic transmission is accompanied by a significant change in the postsynaptic quantal size. Together, our study reveals a differential regulation in GABAergic circuits in the cortex driven by eye opening likely crucial for cortical maturation and function.",

    "abstract": "Successful execution of goal-directed behaviors often requires the deployment of cognitive control, which is thought to require cognitive effort. Recent theories have proposed that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) regulates control levels by weighing the reward-related benefits of control against its effort-related costs. However, given that the sensations of cognitive effort and reward valuation are available only to introspection, this hypothesis is difficult to investigate empirically. We have proposed that two electrophysiological indices of ACC function, frontal midline theta and the reward positivity (RewP), provide objective measures of these functions. To investigate this issue, we recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from participants engaged in an extended, cognitively-demanding task. Participants performed a time estimation task for 2 hours in which they received reward and error feedback according to their task performance. We observed that the amplitude of the RewP, a feedback-locked component of the event related brain potential associated with reward processing, decreased with time-on-task. Conversely, frontal midline theta power, which consists of 4-8 Hz EEG oscillations associated with cognitive effort, increased with time-on-task. We also examined how these phenomena changed over time by conducting within-participant multi-level modeling analyses. Our results suggest that extended execution of a cognitively-demanding task is characterized by an early phase in which high control levels combine with strong reward valuation to foster rapid improvements in task performance, and a later phase in which high control levels counteract waning reward valuation to maintain stable task performance.",

    "abstract": "The effort to characterize intrinsically disordered regions of signaling proteins is rapidly expanding. An important class of disordered interaction modules are ubiquitous and functionally diverse elements known as short linear motifs (SLiMs). To further examine the role of SLiMs in signal transduction, we used a previously devised bioinformatics method to predict evolutionarily conserved SLiMs within a well-characterized pathway in S. cerevisiae. Using a single cell, reporter-based flow cytometry assay in conjunction with a fluorescent reporter driven by a pathway-specific promoter, we quantitatively assessed pathway output via systematic deletions of individual motifs. We found that, when deleted, 34% (10/29) of predicted SLiMs displayed a significant decrease in pathway output, providing evidence that these motifs play a role in signal transduction. In addition, we show that perturbations of parameters in a previously published stochastic model of HOG signaling could reproduce the quantitative effects of 4 out of 7 mutations in previously unknown SLiMs. Our study suggests that, even in well-characterized pathways, large numbers of functional elements remain undiscovered, and that challenges remain for application of systems biology models to interpret the effects of mutations in signalling pathways.\\n\\nOne-sentence SummaryMutations of short conserved elements in disordered regions have quantitative effects on a model signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity hotspots should be given high priority for conservation under the situation of global climate change. The sky islands in southwestern China are characterized by extraordinarily high species diversity and are among one of the worlds top biodiversity hotspots. However, neither the actual species diversity in this region or mechanisms generating this diversity are well explored. Here, we report on the phylogeographic analysis of the long-tailed mole (Scaptonyx fusicaudus), a semi-fossorial mammal that inhabits the montane cool forests across the Chinese sky islands and is considered to represent one species divided into two subspecies. Analyses using DNA sequence data from one mitochondrial and six nuclear genes revealed that populations inhabiting different mountains exhibited exceptionally strong geographic structure. The lowlands and large rivers act as \\\"soft\\\" and \\\"hard\\\" barriers to dispersal, respectively, isolating evolutionary lineages for up to 11 million years. Our results suggest that the mountain ranges act as interglacial refugia buffering populations from climate fluctuations, further facilitating allopatric diversification. Strikingly, species delimitation analyses suggests that the long-tailed mole may comprise 18 operational taxonomic units and 17 putative species. Our results suggest that for low-vagility species, the complex topography of the Chinese sky islands has shaped genetic diversity and structure and promoted exceptional diversification through a combination of eco-environmental stability as well as geographic fragmentation. The patterns observed in S. fusicaudus may be representative for other cold- adapted species, reflecting the generation of mammalian faunal diversity in the sky-island mountains of southwestern China.",
