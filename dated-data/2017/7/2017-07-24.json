    "abstract": "Cell fate and patterning during development are controlled by gene expression. Pre-initiation complex (PIC) formation at promoters is crucial to recruit the transcriptional machinery. The PIC has mainly been studied in vitro, and little is known about its composition and function during development. TAF10 is a subunit of TFIID and of the transcriptional co-activator SAGA. Here we characterized TFIID and SAGA's composition during mouse development. Our data indicate that TAF10 is required for TFIID and SAGA assembly. To analyse TAF10-dependent gene regulation during development, we conditionally deleted Taf10 in the mesoderm. Our results provide evidence for a time window during which Taf10 loss in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) does not prevent cyclic gene transcription or PSM patterning while lateral plate differentiation is profoundly altered. During this period, global steady state mRNA levels are not significantly affected in the PSM although the expression of a subset of specific genes is dysregulated. Together, our data demonstrate a differential sensibility of mesodermal tissues to the lack of TAF10. This supports a differential requirement for TAF10 by the general transcriptional machinery during different developmental processes.",

    "abstract": "Genetic material sequenced from ancient samples is revolutionizing our understanding of the recent evolutionary past. However, ancient DNA is often degraded, resulting in low coverage, error-prone sequencing. Several solutions exist to this problem, ranging from simple approach such as selecting a read at random for each site to more complicated approaches involving genotype likelihoods. In this work, we present a novel method for assessing the relationship of an ancient sample with a modern population while accounting for sequencing error and post-mortem damage by analyzing raw read from multiple ancient individuals simultaneously. We show that when analyzing SNP data, it is better to sequence more ancient samples to low coverage: two samples sequenced to 0.5x coverage provide better resolution than a single sample sequenced to 2x coverage. We also examined the power to detect whether an ancient sample is directly ancestral to a modern population, finding that with even a few high cover-age individuals, even ancient samples that are very slightly diverged from the modern population can be detected with ease. When we applied our approach to European samples, we found that no ancient samples represent direct ancestors of modern Europeans. We also found that, as shown previously, the most ancient Europeans appear to have had the smallest effective population sizes, indicating a role for agriculture in modern population growth.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been widely used in explaining animal behavior. In reinforcement learning, the agent learns the value of the states in the task, collectively constituting the task state space, and use the knowledge to choose actions and acquire desired outcomes. It has been proposed that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encodes the task state space during reinforcement learning. However, it is not well understood how the OFC acquires and stores task state information. Here, we propose a neural network model based on reservoir computing. Reservoir networks exhibit heterogeneous and dynamic activity patterns that are suitable to encode task states. The information can be extracted by a linear readout trained with reinforcement learning. We demonstrate how the network acquires and stores the task structures. The network exhibits reinforcement learning behavior and its aspects resemble experimental findings of the OFC. Our study provides a theoretical explanation of how the OFC may contribute to reinforcement learning and a new approach to understanding the neural mechanism underlying reinforcement learning.",

    "abstract": "Balancing selection maintains advantageous diversity in populations through various mechanisms. While extensively explored from a theoretical perspective, an empirical understanding of its prevalence and targets lags behind our knowledge of positive selection. Here we describe the Non-Central Deviation (NCD), a simple yet powerful statistic to detect long-term balancing selection (LTBS) that quantifies how close frequencies are to expectations under LTBS, and provides the basis for a neutrality test. NCD can be applied to a single locus or genomic data, and can be implemented considering only polymorphisms (NCD1) or also considering fixed differences with respect to an outgroup (NCD2) species. Incorporating fixed differences improves power, and NCD2 has higher power to detect LTBS in humans under different frequencies of the balanced allele(s) than other available methods. Applied to genome-wide data from African and European human populations, in both cases using chimpanzee as an outgroup, NCD2 shows that, albeit not prevalent, LTBS affects a sizable portion of the genome: about 0.6% of analyzed genomic windows and 0.8% of analyzed positions. Significant windows (p < 0.0001) contain 1.6% of SNPs in the genome, which disproportionally fall within exons and change protein sequence, but are not enriched in putatively regulatory sites. These windows overlap about 8% of the protein-coding genes, and these have larger number of transcripts than expected by chance even after controlling for gene length. Our catalog includes known targets of LTBS but a majority of them (90%) are novel. As expected, immune-related genes are among those with the strongest signatures, although most candidates are involved in other biological functions, suggesting that LTBS potentially influences diverse human phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGenotyping and parameter estimation using high throughput sequencing data are everyday tasks for population geneticists, but methods developed for diploids are typically not applicable to polyploid taxa. This is due to their duplicated chromosomes, as well as the complex patterns of allelic exchange that often accompany whole genome duplication (WGD) events. For WGDs within a single lineage (auto polyploids), inbreeding can result from mixed mating and/or double reduction. For WGDs that involve hybridization (allopolyploids), alleles are typically inherited through independently segregating subgenomes.\\n\\nResultsWe present two new models for estimating genotypes and population genetic parameters from genotype likelihoods for auto- and allopolyploids. We then use simulations to compare these models to existing approaches at varying depths of sequencing coverage and ploidy levels. These simulations show that our models typically have lower levels of estimation error for genotype and parameter estimates, especially when sequencing coverage is low. Finally, we also apply these models to two empirical data sets from the literature. Overall, we show that the use of genotype likelihoods to model non-standard inheritance patterns is a promising approach for conducting population genomic inferences in polyploids.\\n\\nAvailabilityA C++ program, EBG, is provided to perform inference using the models we describe.

Accordingly, each of these distinctions have been used to classify cancer subtypes and to reveal common features. Here, we present a different analysis of cancer based on amino acid mutation signatures. Non-negative Matrix Factorization and principal component analysis of 29 cancers revealed six amino acid mutation signatures, including four signatures that were dominated by either arginine to histidine (Arg>His) or glutamate to lysine (Glu>Lys) mutations. Sample-level analyses reveal that while some cancers are heterogeneous, others are largely dominated by one type of mutation. Using a non-overlapping set of samples from the COSMIC somatic mutation database, we validate five of six mutation signatures, including signatures with prominent arginine to histidine (Arg>His) or glutamate to lysine (Glu>Lys) mutations. This suggests that our classification of cancers based on amino acid mutation patterns may provide avenues of inquiry pertaining to specific protein mutations that may generate novel insights into cancer biology.",

    "abstract": "The malaria-causing blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum requires extracellular pantothenate for proliferation. The parasite converts pantothenate into coenzyme A (CoA) via five enzymes, the first being a pantothenate kinase (PfPanK). Multiple antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, including pantothenol and CJ-15,801, kill the parasite by targeting CoA biosynthesis/utilisation. Their mechanism of action, however, remains unknown. Here, we show that parasites pressured with pantothenol or CJ-15,801 become resistant to these analogues. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in one of two putative PanK genes (Pfpank1) in each resistant line. These mutations significantly alter PfPanK activity, with two conferring a fitness cost, consistent with Pfpank1 coding for a functional PanK that is essential for normal growth. The mutants exhibit a different sensitivity profile to recently-described, potent, antiplasmodial pantothenate analogues, with one line being hypersensitive. We provide evidence consistent with different pantothenate analogue classes having different mechanisms of action: some inhibit CoA biosynthesis while others inhibit CoA-utilising enzymes.",

However, these measures say little about where in the organism these deleterious effects will be most apparent. An additional, complementary measure is needed to link deleterious variants (as determined by e.g., CADD) to tissues in which their effect will be most meaningful. Here, we introduce TiSAn (Tissue Specific Annotation), a tool that predicts how related a genomic position is to a given tissue (http://github.com/kevinVervier/TiSAn). TiSAn uses machine learning on genome-scale, tissue-specific data to discriminate variants relevant to a tissue from those having no bearing on the development or function of that tissue. Predictions are then made genome-wide, and these scores can then be used to contextualize and filter variants of interest in whole genome sequencing or genome wide association studies (GWAS). We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of TiSAn by introducing predictive models for human heart and human brain, and detecting tissue-relevant variations in large cohorts for autism spectrum disorder (TiSAn-brain) and coronary artery disease (TiSAn-heart). We find that TiSAn is better able to prioritize genetic variants according to their tissue-specific action than the current state of the art method, GenoSkyLine.",

The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has introns in only 5% of its genes, characteristically at the start of the coding region, and lacks proteins essential for EJC assembly, is not expected to undergo splicing-dependent NMD.

    "abstract": "There was a long standing contradiction between formulations of the competitive exclusion principle and natural species richness, which is known as the biodiversity paradox. Here we investigate a role of fitness differences in coexistence of two completely competing species using individual-based cellular automata. According to the classical formulations of the competitive exclusion principle such coexistence is impossible. Earlier we found that coexistence of complete competitors is possible with a 100% difference in fitness, but only under certain initial conditions. Here we verify a hypothesis that completely competing species may coexist with less than 100% difference in fitness regardless of different initial location of competing individuals in the ecosystem. We have found a new fact that two aggressively propagating complete competitors can stably coexist in one limited, stable and homogeneous habitat, when one species has some advantage in fitness over the other and all other characteristics of the species are equal, in particular any trade-offs and cooperations are absent. This fact is established theoretically on the rigorous model. The found competitive coexistence occurred regardless of the initial location of individuals in the ecosystem. When colonization of free habitat started from a single individual of each species, then the complete competitors coexisted up to 31% of their difference in fitness.

To examine further the role of the CC\\\"D region in poliovirus infection, we substituted this region of Pvr into the corresponding region of a murine homolog, nectin-2. The chimeric receptor, nectin-2Pvr(c'c\\\"d), rendered transformed L cells susceptible to infection with poliovirus P1/Mahoney, but not with polioviruses P2/Lansing and P3/Leon, due to lack of binding. Twenty-four variants of P2/Lansing were selected that replicate in nectin-2Pvr(c'c\\\"d) producing cell lines. Sequence analysis revealed 30 amino acid changes at 28 capsid residues. One change, K1103R, is found in nearly all isolates and is located at one end of the VP1 BC loop. Other alterations are located on the canyon surface, at the protomer interface, and along the perimeter of the canyon south wall. Unlike poliovirus-Pvr binding, the VP1 BC loop is required for infection of cells producing nectin-2Pvr(c'c\\\"d).",

    "abstract": "Mitosis relies on forces generated in the spindle, a micro-machine composed of microtubules and associated proteins1,2. Forces are required for the congression of chromosomes to the metaphase plate and separation of chromatids in anaphase3-6. However, torques may also exist in the spindle, yet they have not been investigated. Here we show that the spindle is chiral. Chirality is evident from the finding that microtubule bundles follow a left-handed helical path, which cannot be explained by forces but rather by torques acting in the bundles. STED super-resolution microscopy, as well as confocal microscopy, of human spindles shows that the bundles have complex curved shapes. The average helicity of the bundles with respect to the spindle axis is 1.2{degrees}/m. Inactivation of kinesin-5 (Eg5/Kif11) abolished the chirality of the spindle, suggesting that this motor generates the helical shape of microtubule bundles. To explain the observed shapes, we introduce a theoretical model for the balance of forces and torques acting in the spindle, and show that torque is required to generate the helical shapes. We conclude that torques generated by motor proteins, in addition to forces, exist in the spindle and determine its architecture.",

Mosquito mapper allows the recording of mosquito encounters as well as conditions surrounding the encounter. It also features a rudimentary identification tool. The goal of the application is to create a database and construct a map of the encounters free to consult for citizens and scientists. Such database constitutes a necessary first step for the development of useful management strategies addressing potential human health threats induced by mosquitoes. The citizen scientist may voluntarily provide other additional information on the circumstances of the encounter that may contain scientifically useful information. We describe the current features of the application, discuss their strength, limits, potential scientific value and suggest possible future extensions.

We present extensive analyses of these results which provide new insights into the nature of MDD. The genetic findings were associated with clinical features of MDD, and implicated prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in the pathophysiology of MDD (regions exhibiting anatomical differences between MDD cases and controls). Genes that are targets of antidepressant medications were strongly enriched for MDD association signals (P=8.5x10-10), suggesting the relevance of these findings for improved pharmacotherapy of MDD. Sets of genes involved in gene splicing and in creating isoforms were also enriched for smaller MDD GWA P-values, and these gene sets have also been implicated in schizophrenia and autism. Genetic risk for MDD was correlated with that for many adult and childhood onset psychiatric disorders. Our analyses suggested important relations of genetic risk for MDD with educational attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: the genetic basis of lower educational attainment and higher body mass were putatively causal for MDD whereas MDD and schizophrenia reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater numbers of genetic risk factors for MDD, and a continuous measure of risk underlies the observed clinical phenotype. MDD is not a distinct entity that neatly demarcates normalcy from pathology but rather a useful clinical construct associated with a range of adverse outcomes and the end result of a complex process of intertwined genetic and environmental effects. These findings help refine and define the fundamental basis of MDD.",

    "abstract": "The widespread use of antimicrobials under clinical and agricultural settings has resulted in the evolution of resistance to these compounds. To combat the emergence of resistance, current research efforts are focusing on designing treatments to exploit combinations of antimicrobials, where the evolution of resistance confers sensitivity to alternative compounds. In this work we demonstrate that strains of Pseudomonas syringae possess a natural analogue to this strategy. Specifically, we demonstrate that a single strain produces multiple bacteriocins that can target another strain, but antimicrobial activity of the second bacteriocin is manifest only after resistance to the first emerges. The evolution of resistance also sensitizes the target strain to bacteriocins from a variety of other strains. Strains of P. syringae therefore encode multiple bacteriocins that can act in a conditionally redundant manner. It is possible that combinations of bacteriocins could be applied as a cocktail or sequentially, to potentially achieve durable pathogen control.",

    "abstract": "Distributed neural dysconnectivity is considered a hallmark feature of schizophrenia, yet a tension exists between studies pinpointing focal disruptions versus those implicating brain-wide disturbances. The cerebellum and the striatum communicate reciprocally with the thalamus and cortex through monosynaptic and polysynaptic connections, forming cortico-striatal-thalamic-cerebellar (CSTC) functional pathways that may be sensitive to brain-wide dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. It remains unknown if the same pattern of alterations persists across CSTC systems, or if specific alterations exist along key functional elements of these networks. We characterized connectivity along major functional CSTC subdivisions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in 159 chronic patients and 162 matched controls. Associative CSTC subdivisions revealed consistent brain-wide bi-directional alterations in patients, marked by hyper-connectivity with sensory-motor cortices and hypo-connectivity with association cortex. Focusing on the cerebellar and striatal components, we validate the effects using data-driven k-means clustering of voxel-wise dysconnectivity and support vector machine classifiers. We replicate these results in an independent sample of 202 controls and 145 patients, additionally demonstrating that these neural effects relate to cognitive performance across subjects. Taken together, these results from complementary approaches implicate a consistent motif of brain-wide alterations in CSTC systems in schizophrenia, calling into question accounts of exclusively focal functional disturbances.",

    "abstract": "Wastewater is an important reservoir for Escherichia coli and can present significant acute toxicity if released into receiving water sources without being adequately treated. To analyze whether pathogenic E. coli strains that cause infections are in treated effluent and to recognize antibiotic profile. 476 confirmed isolates from two treatment Plants were characterized for the presence of various E. coli pathotypes. A total of 8 pathotypes were screened and only four were confirmed. UPEC was about 5.7% followed by EAEC at 2.3%, NMEC at 1.1% and EPEC at 0.6%. Antibiotic susceptibility patterns of E. coli pathotypes such as UPEC showed low resistance to antibiotics like meropenem (100%), cefotaxime (100%) and gentamicin (88.9%). The pathotype also showed high degrees of resistance to tetracycline (74.1%), ampicillin (74.1%) and cephalothin (66.7%). Other E. coli pathotypes, EAEC, NMEC and EPEC, showed high sensitivity (100%) to meropenem, gentamicin and cefotaxime, and varying degree of resistances to ampicillin, tetracycline and cephalothin. The results of this study reveal that the two Plants discharge effluents with pathogenic E. coli and are reservoir for the bacteria into receiving water sources. In summary, this finding raises the possibility that at least some pathogenic E. coli pathotypes are getting into the environment through WWTPs and represent potential route for enteropathogenic infection. In addition, certain pathotypes may have acquired resistance properties, becoming a potential cause of drug resistance infection. This study reveals inadequacy of the plants studied to produce effluents of acceptable quality.",

But they are also pests which cause billions of dollars in damage annually to humans. Currently, our understanding of the mechanisms influencing species occurrences is limited and we do not know what distinguishes pest from non-pest species. We analyzed how anthropogenic disturbance (agriculture) affects species occurrences. We tested the hypothesis that strong disturbance functions as a habitat filter and selects for a subset of species which are major pests of crop. Using a cross-sectional approach, we studied termite community composition along a disturbance gradient from fields to 12-year-old fallows in a West African savanna. We reliably identified 19 species using genetic markers with a mean of about 10 species - many of them from the same feeding type - co-occurring locally. Supporting our hypothesis, disturbance was associated with environmental filtering of termites from the regional species pool, maybe via its effect on vegetation type. The most heavily disturbed sites were characterized by a subset of termite species which are well-known pests of crop. This is in line with the idea that strong anthropogenic disturbance selects for termite pest species.",

We performed DNaseI-SEQ to identify genome-wide profiles of transcription factor binding in leaves of the C4 grasses Zea mays, Sorghum bicolor and Setaria italica as well as C3 Brachypodium distachyon. In C4 species, while bundle sheath strands and whole leaves shared similarity in the broad regions of DNA accessible to transcription factors, the short sequences bound varied. Transcription factor binding was prevalent in gene bodies as well as promoters, and many of these sites could represent duons that impact gene regulation in addition to amino acid sequence. Although globally there was little correlation between any individual DNaseI footprint and cell-specific gene expression, within individual species transcription factor binding to the same motifs in multiple genes provided evidence for shared mechanisms governing C4 photosynthesis gene expression. Furthermore, interspecific comparisons identified a small number of highly conserved transcription factor binding sites associated with leaves from species that diverged around 60 million years ago. These data therefore provide insight into the architecture associated with C4 photosynthesis gene expression in particular and characteristics of transcription factor binding in cereal crops in general.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryGenome-wide patterns of transcription factor binding in vivo defined by DNaseI for leaves of C3 and C4 grasses",

How conformational dynamics of Cas9 governs its nuclease activity under on- and off-target conditions remains largely unknown. Here, using intra-molecular single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements, we revealed that Cas9 in apo, sgRNA-bound, and dsDNA/sgRNA-bound forms all spontaneously transits between three major conformational states, mainly reflecting significant conformational mobility of the catalytic HNH domain. We furthermore uncovered a surprising long-range allosteric communication between the HNH domain and RNA/DNA heteroduplex at the PAM-distal end to ensure correct positioning of the catalytic site, which demonstrated a unique proofreading mechanism served as the last checkpoint before DNA cleavage. Several Cas9 residues were likely to mediate the allosteric communication and proofreading step. Modulating interactions between Cas9 and heteroduplex at the distal end by introducing mutations on these sites provides an alternative route to improve and optimize the CRISPR/Cas9 toolbox.",

In this paper, we compare different batch-correction methods applied to microbiome case-control studies. We introduce a model-free normalization procedure where features (i.e. bacterial taxa) in case samples are converted to percentiles of the equivalent features in control samples within a study prior to pooling data across studies. We look at how this percentile-normalization method compares to traditional meta-analysis methods for combining independent p-values and to limma and ComBat, widely used batch-correction models developed for RNA microarray data. Overall, we show that percentile-normalization is a simple, non-parametric approach for correcting batch effects and improving sensitivity in case-control meta-analyses.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryBatch effects are obstacles to comparing results across studies. Traditional meta-analysis techniques for combining p-values from independent studies, like Fishers method, are effective but statistically conservative.

We found five amino acid sites to be under significant positive selection in [&ge;]50% of the patients, and 22 sites housing mutations consistent with antibody-mediated selection.

With lab cultures, we found that cyanophages used three infection strategies in the dark: no adsorption, adsorption but no replication, and replication. Interestingly, the former two exhibited rhythmic infection patterns under light-dark cycles. We further showed in the South China Sea and the Western Pacific Ocean that cyanophage abundances varied rhythmically, with a peak at night. Moreover, diel transcriptional rhythms of many cyanophage genes were found in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre, which also peaked at night. Our results suggested that cyanophage infection of Prochlorococcus is synchronized to the light-dark cycle, which may result in a synchronized release of dissolved organic matter to the marine food web.",

    "abstract": "Understanding is emerging about microRNAs as mediators in the regulation of white adipose tissue (WAT) and obesity. The expression level of miR-199a in mice was investigated to test our hypothesis: miR-199a might be related to fat accumulation and try to find its target mRNA, which perhaps could propose strategies with a therapeutic potential affecting the fat storage. C57/BL6J mice were randomly assigned to either a control group or an obesity model group (n=10 in both groups). Control mice were fed a normal diet (fat: 10 kcal %) ad libitum for 12 weeks, and model mice were fed a high-fat diet (fat: 30 kcal %) ad libitum for 12 weeks to induce obesity. At the end of the experiment, body fat mass and the free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglycerides (TGs) in WAT were tested. Fat cell size was measured by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining method. The fat mass of the model group was higher than that of the control group (P<0.05). In addition, the concentrations of the FFAs and TGs were higher (P<0.05) and the adipocyte count was lower (P<0.05) in the model group. We tested the expression levels of miR-199a and key adipogenic transcription factors, including peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma2 (PPAR{gamma}2), CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins alpha (C/EBP), adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (aP2), and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c). Up-regulated expression of miR-199a was observed in model group. Increased levels of miR-199a was accompanied by high expression levels of SREBP-1c. We found that the 3-UTR of SREBP-1c mRNA has a predicted binding site for miR-199a. Based on the current discoveries, we suggest that miR-199a may exert its action by binding to its target mRNA and cooperate with SREBP-1c to induce obesity. Therefore, if the predicted binding site is confirmed by further research, miR-199a may have therapeutic potential for obesity.\\n\\nAbbreviationsWAT, white adipose tissue; PPAR{gamma}2, peroxisome proliferator, activated receptor {gamma}2; C/EBP CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins ; aP2, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein; SREBP-1c, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c; HFD, high-fat diet.",

    "abstract": "Humans excel at selectively listening to a target speaker in background noise such as competing voices. While the encoding of speech in the auditory cortex is modulated by selective attention, it remains debated whether such modulation occurs already in subcortical auditory structures. Investigating the contribution of the human brainstem to attention has, in particular, been hindered by the tiny amplitude of the brainstem response. Its measurement normally requires a large number of repetitions of the same short sound stimuli, which may lead to a loss of attention and to neural adaptation. Here we develop a mathematical method to measure the auditory brainstem response to running speech, an acoustic stimulus that does not repeat and that has a high ecological validity. We employ this method to assess the brainstems activity when a subject listens to one of two competing speakers, and show that the brainstem response is consistently modulated by attention.",

    "abstract": "Parasites play an important role in invasion success with important consequences for biodiversity and community structure. While much research has focused on direct effects of parasites on biological invasions, parasites can also indirectly influence interactions within the invaded community across trophic levels. For instance, parasites can mediate competitive interactions between native and exotic species through trait-mediated indirect effects. We consider the interactions between the parasitoid fly Pseudacteon sp. (Diptera: Phoridae), and its native host ant Linipethema iniquum, and the exotic ant Wasmannia auropunctata in the introduced range of Puerto Rico. We examined the effects of phorid flies on the competitive outcome between the arboreal ants W. auropunctata and native ant L. iniquum. Furthermore, we investigate the searching efficiency of phorid flies in detecting L. iniquum nests. To study the indirect effects on ant competition, we monitored ant recruitment to baits over a 60-min time interval in the presence and absence of phorid fly parasitoids. We then performed field experiments and measured phorid arrival time to arboreal nests of L. iniquum located in both a) W. auropunctata patches and in b) isolated patches dominated by L. iniquum nests. We found that the presence of phorid fly significantly reduced recruitment of L. iniquum workers to baits through induced behavioral changes thereby increasing the ability of W. auropunctata to acquire resources. In addition, we found that phorid arrival time in isolated patches of L. iniquum patches was faster as compared to L. iniquum nests located within W. auropunctata patches. Our results show that phorid fly parasitoids indirectly may influence competitive interactions by attacking the host-ant L. iniquum and consequently providing an advantage to local spread of W. auropuntata populations in Puerto Rico. However, the spatial dynamics of arboreal ants shows that L. iniquum seeks protection from phorid fly parasotoids by moving their nests to W. auropunctata dominated patches.",

Although canonically assumed to be maintained in equivalent proportions, some RPs have been shown to possess differential expression across tissue types. Dysregulation of RP expression occurs in a variety of human diseases, notably in many cancers, and altered expression of some RPs correlates with different tumor phenotypes and patient survival. To investigate the impact of global RP transcript (RPT) expression patterns on tumor phenotypes, we analyzed RPT expression of ~10,000 human tumors and 700 normal tissues with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). We show here that normal tissues and cancers possess readily discernible RPT expression patterns. In tumors, this patterning is distinct from normal tissues, distinguishes tumor subtypes from one another, and in many cases correlates with molecular, pathological, and clinical features, including survival. Collectively, RPT expression can be used as a powerful and novel method of tumor classification, offering a potential clinical tool for prognosis and therapeutic stratification.",

    "abstract": "Patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) have become a prominent model for studying human cancer in vivo. The underlying assumption is that PDXs faithfully represent the genomic features of primary tumors, retaining their molecular characteristics throughout propagation. However, the genomic stability of PDXs during passaging has not yet been evaluated systematically. Here we monitored the dynamics of copy number alterations (CNAs) in 1,110 PDX samples across 24 cancer types. We found that new CNAs accumulated quickly, such that within four passages an average of 12% of the genome was affected by newly acquired CNAs. Selection for preexisting minor clones was a major contributor to these changes, leading to both gains and losses of CNAs. The rate of CNA acquisition in PDX models was correlated with the extent of both aneuploidy and genetic heterogeneity observed in primary tumors of the same tissue. However, the specific CNAs acquired during PDX passaging differed from those acquired during tumor evolution in patients, suggesting that PDX tumors are subjected to distinct selection pressures compared to those that exist in human hosts. Specifically, several recurrent CNAs observed in primary tumors gradually disappeared in PDXs, indicating that events undergoing positive selection in humans can become dispensable during propagation in mice. Finally, we found that the genomic stability of PDX models also affected their responses to chemotherapy and targeted drugs. Our findings thus highlight the need to couple the timing of PDX molecular characterization to that of drug testing experiments. These results suggest that while PDX models are powerful tools, they should be used with caution.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, cells undertake a series of fate decisions to form a complete organism comprised of various cell types, epitomising a branching process. A striking example of branching occurs in humans around the time of implantation, when primordial germ cells (PGCs), precursors of sperm and eggs, and somatic lineages are specified. Due to inaccessibility of human embryos at this stage of development, understanding the mechanisms of PGC specification remains difficult. The integrative modelling of single cell transcriptomics data from embryos and appropriate in vitro models should prove to be a useful resource for investigating this system, provided that the cells can be suitably ordered over a developmental axis. Unfortunately, most methods for inferring cell ordering were not designed with structured (time series) data in mind. Although some probabilistic approaches address these limitations by incorporating prior information about the developmental stage (capture time) of the cell, they do not allow the ordering of cells over processes with more than one terminal cell fate. To investigate the mechanisms of PGC specification, we develop a probabilistic pseudotime approach, branch-recombinant Gaussian process latent variable models (B-RGPLVMs), that use an explicit model of transcriptional branching in individual marker genes, allowing the ordering of cells over developmental trajectories with arbitrary numbers of branches. We use first demonstrate the advantage of our approach over existing pseudotime algorithms and subsequently use it to investigate early human development, as primordial germ cells (PGCs) and somatic cells diverge. We identify known master regulators of human PGCs, and predict roles for a variety of signalling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifiers. By concentrating on the earliest branched signalling events, we identified an antagonistic role for FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway in the acquisition of competence for human PGC fate, and identify putative roles for PRC1 and PRC2 in PGC specification. We experimentally validate our predictions using pharmacological blocking of FGFR or its downstream effectors (MEK, PI3K and JAK), and demonstrate enhanced competency for PGC fate in vitro, whilst small molecule inhibition of the enzymatic component of PRC1/PRC2 reveals reduced capacity of cells to form PGCs in vitro. Thus, B-RGPLVMs represent a powerful and flexible data-driven approach for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cell fate decisions, providing unique insights into the mechanisms of early embryogenesis.

    "abstract": "BackgroundBirth by Cesarean section increases the risk of developing type 1 diabetes later in life; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of this effect remain unclear. We aimed to elucidate common regulatory processes observed after Cesarean section and the development of islet autoimmunity, which precedes type 1 diabetes, by investigating the transcriptome of blood cells in the developing immune system.\\n\\nMethodsWe analyzed gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells taken at several time points from children with increased familial and genetic risk for type 1 diabetes (n = 109). We investigated effects of Cesarean section on gene expression profiles of children in the first year of life using a generalized additive mixed model to account for the longitudinal data structure. To investigate the effect of islet autoimmunity, we compared gene expression differences between children after initiation of islet autoimmunity and age-matched children who did not develop islet autoantibodies. Finally, we compared both results to identify common regulatory patterns of Cesarean section and islet autoimmunity at the gene expression level.\\n\\nResultsWe identified two differentially expressed pathways in children born by Cesarean section: the pentose phosphate pathway and pyrimidine metabolism, both involved in nucleotide synthesis and cell proliferation. Islet autoantibody analysis revealed multiple differentially expressed pathways generally involved in immune processes, including both of the above-mentioned nucleotide synthesis pathways. Comparison of global gene expression signatures showed that transcriptomic changes were systematically and significantly correlated between Cesarean section and islet autoimmunity. In addition, signatures of both Cesarean section and islet autoimmunity correlated with transcriptional changes observed during activation of isolated CD4+ T lymphocytes.\\n\\nConclusionsWe identified coherent gene expression signatures for Cesarean section, an early risk factor for type 1 diabetes, and islet autoantibodies positivity, an obligatory stage of autoimmune response prior to the development of type 1 diabetes. Both transcriptional signatures were correlated with changes in gene expression during the activation of CD4+ T lymphocytes, reflecting common molecular changes in immune cell activation.",

Using CRISPRi technology we have tested 3200 genes for their ability to regulate tau entry and identified enzymes in the heparan sulfate proteoglycan biosynthetic pathway as key regulators.

    "abstract": "Constraint-based metabolic flux analysis of knockout strategies is an efficient method to simulate the production of useful metabolites in microbes. Owing to the recent development of technologies for artificial DNA synthesis, it may become important in the near future to mathematically design minimum metabolic networks to simulate metabolite production. Accordingly, we have developed a computational method where parsimonious metabolic flux distribution is computed for designated constraints on growth and production rates which are represented by grids. When the growth rate of this obtained parsimonious metabolic network is maximized, higher production rates compared to those noted using existing methods are observed for many target metabolites. The set of reactions used in this parsimonious flux distribution consists of reactions included in the original genome scale model iAF1260. The computational experiments show that the grid size affects the obtained production rates. Under the conditions that the growth rate is maximized and the minimum cases of flux variability analysis are considered, the developed method produced more than 90% of metabolites, while the existing methods produced less than 50%. Mathematical explanations using examples are provided to demonstrate potential reasons for the ability of the proposed algorithm to identify design strategies that the existing methods could not identify. The source code is freely available, and is implemented in MATLAB and COBRA toolbox.\\n\\nAuthor summaryMetabolic networks represent the relationships between biochemical reactions and compounds in living cells. By computationally modifying a given metabolic network of microbes, we can simulate the effect of knockouts and estimate the production of valuable metabolites. A common mathematical model of metabolic networks is the constraint-based flux model. In constraint-based flux balance analysis, a pseudo-steady state is assumed to predict the metabolic profile where the sum of all incoming fluxes is equal to the sum of all outgoing fluxes for each internal metabolite. Based on these constraints, the biomass objective function, written as a linear combination of fluxes, is maximized. In this study, we developed an efficient method for computing the design of minimum metabolic networks by using constraint-based flux balance analysis to simulate the production of useful metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Here we propose new module-based approaches to identify differentially regulated network sub-modules combining temporal trajectories of expression profiles with static network skeletons. Starting from modules identified by network clustering of static networks, our analysis refines pre-defined genesets by partitioning them into smaller homogeneous sets by non-paramettric Bayesian methods. Especially for case-control time series data we developed multi-time point discriminative models and identified each network module as a mixture or admixture of dynamic discriminative functions. Our results shows that our proposed approach outperformed existing geneset enrichment methods in simulation studies. Moreover we applied the methods to neural stem cell differentiation data, and discovered novel modules differentially perturbed in different developmental stages.",

    "abstract": "A new statistical method based on a stochastic dynamic model is proposed to assess population abundances of murcid species at scales relevant to both Ancient and Modern artisanal, coastal fisheries. Motivated by the long-term goal of reconstructing the dynamics of exploited murex populations during Antiquity, the objective was to quantify the population density of the banded-dye murex, Hexaplex trunculus (Linnaeus, 1758) from successive captures with baited traps, using a method similar to the technique employed in the Mediterranean purple dye industry. A stochastic model simulating cumulative captures while taking into account high variability was developed and calibrated with data acquired during a field experiment conducted on Crete Island, near Heraklion. Sampling devices were deployed in two shallow water habitats. The traps catchability and the Effective Area of Attraction were estimated using the individual speed and behavioural response toward the bait observed during independent laboratory experiments. The average density of H. trunculus was estimated at 2.2 {+/-} 1.4 SE individuals per square meter, with no significant differences between seagrass and rocky habitats, respectively. The clearing time (the time to catch all individuals within reach of the trap) of the successive experiments was 84 {+/-} 6 SE hours, on average. This means that clearing ca. 0.4 ha of subtidal area would be necessary to produce ca. 1.0 g of pure dye pigment. While the method is discussed here with respect to a particular historical context, it is generalizable to making population abundance estimates for other species such as whelks, in modern fisheries.",

    "abstract": "Rapid evolution in response to environmental change will likely be a driving force determining the distribution of species and the structure of communities across the biosphere in coming decades. This is especially true of microorganisms, many of which may be able to evolve in step with rising temperatures. An ecologically indispensable group of microorganisms with great potential for rapid thermal adaptation are the phytoplankton, the diverse photosynthetic microbes forming the foundation of most aquatic food webs. We tested the capacity of a globally important phytoplankton species, the marine diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, for rapid evolution in response to temperature. Evolution of replicate populations at 16 and 31{degrees}C for 350-450 generations led to significant divergence in several traits associated with T. pseudonanas thermal reaction norm (TRN) for per-capita population growth, as well as in its competitive ability for nitrogen (commonly limiting in marine systems). Of particular interest were evolution of the optimum temperature for growth, the upper critical temperature, and the derivative of the TRN, an indicator of potential tradeoffs resulting from local adaptation to temperature. This study offers a broad examination of the evolution of the thermal reaction norm and how modes of TRN variation may govern a populations long-term physiological, ecological, and biogeographic response to global climate change.",

    "abstract": "Bats are reservoirs for a number of highly pathogenic zoonotic viruses, yet they remain relatively asymptomatic during infection. Whether this viral resistance is due to a unique innate immune system is unknown. An evolutionarily conserved feature of vertebrate antiviral immunity is the interferon (IFN) response, which triggers cellular defenses through interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression. While bats encode an intact IFN system, global ISG expression patterns in bat cells are not well characterized. Here, we used RNA-Seq to assess the transcriptional response to IFN in cells derived from the bat Pteropus alecto (black flying fox). We show induction of more than 100 transcripts, most of which are canonical ISGs observed in other species. Kinetic gene profiling revealed that P. alecto ISGs fall into two unique temporal subclusters with similar early induction kinetics but distinct late-phase declines. In contrast to bat ISGs, human ISGs generally remained elevated for longer periods following IFN treatment, suggesting host-based differences in gene regulatory mechanisms. Notably, we also identified a small group of non-canonical bat ISGs, including an enzymatically active RNASEL that plays a role in controlling viral infection. These studies provide insight into the innate immune response of an important viral reservoir and lay a foundation for studies into the immunological features that may underlie unique virus-host relationship in bats.\\n\\nSignificance StatementBats are considered unique in their ability to resist disease caused by viruses that are often pathogenic in humans. While the nature of this viral resistance is unknown, genomic data suggest bat innate immune systems may be specialized in controlling these disease-causing viruses. A critical cell intrinsic antiviral defense system in vertebrates is the interferon response, which suppresses viral infection through induction of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). In this study, we report the repertoire of ISGs and several unique features of ISG induction kinetics in bat cells. We also characterize induction and antiviral activity of bat RNASEL, which is induced by IFN in bat, but not human cells. These studies lay the foundation for discovery of potentially new antiviral mechanisms in bats, which may spur research into development of therapies to combat viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Missing data is a challenge for all studies; however, this is especially true for electronic health record (EHR) based analyses. Failure to appropriately consider missing data can lead to biased results. Here, we provide detailed procedures for when and how to conduct imputation of EHR data. We demonstrate how the mechanism of missingness can be assessed, evaluate the performance of a variety of imputation methods, and describe some of the most frequent problems that can be encountered. We analyzed clinical lab measures from 602,366 patients in the Geisinger Health System EHR. Using these data, we constructed a representative set of complete cases and assessed the performance of 12 different imputation methods for missing data that was simulated based on 4 mechanisms of missingness. Our results show that several methods including variations of Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) and softImpute consistently imputed missing values with low error; however, only a subset of the MICE methods were suitable for multiple imputation. The analyses described provide an outline of considerations for dealing with missing EHR data, steps that researchers can perform to characterize missingness within their own data, and an evaluation of methods that can be applied to impute clinical data. While the performance of methods may vary between datasets, the process we describe can be generalized to the majority of structured data types that exist in EHRs and all of our methods and code are publicly available.",

The right skewed distributions suggest some species have adapted to elevate or evade metabolic constraints. Mammals exhibit greater skew than birds, consistent with their diverse thermoregulatory adaptations and behaviors. Mammal and bird species that are small and occupy low trophic levels exhibit high levels of MEO_SCPLOWCRBC_SCPLOW. Mammals with high MEO_SCPLOWCRBC_SCPLOW tend to hibernate or use torpor. Predicted metabolic rates at the cold range boundaries represent large energetic expenditures (>50% of maximum metabolic rates).

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding has offered unprecedented insights into microbial diversity. In many studies, short DNA sequences are binned into consecutively higher Linnaean ranks, and ranked groups (e.g., genera) are the units of biodiversity analyses. These analyses assume that Linnaean ranks are biologically meaningful and that identically ranked groups are comparable. We used a meta-barcode dataset for marine planktonic diatoms to illustrate the limits of this approach. We found that the 20 most abundant marine planktonic diatom genera ranged in age from 4 to 134 million years, indicating the non-equivalence of genera because some had more time to diversify than others. Still, species richness was only weakly correlated with genus age, highlighting variation in rates of speciation and/or extinction. Taxonomic classifications often do not reflect phylogeny, so genus-level analyses can include phylogenetically nested genera, further confounding rank-based analyses. These results underscore the indispensable role of phylogeny in understanding patterns of microbial diversity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile increasingly large reference panels for genome-wide imputation have been recently made available, the degree to which imputation accuracy can be enhanced by population-specific reference panels remains an open question. In the present study, we sequenced at full-depth ([&ge;]30x) a moderately large (n=738) cohort of samples drawn from the Ashkenazi Jewish population across two platforms (Illumina X Ten and Complete Genomics, Inc.). We developed and refined a series of quality control steps to optimize sensitivity, specificity, and comprehensiveness of variant calls in the reference panel, and then tested the accuracy of imputation against target cohorts drawn from the same population.\\n\\nResultsFor samples sequenced on the Illumina X Ten platform, quality thresholds were identified that permitted highly accurate calling of single nucleotide variants across 94% of the genome. The Complete Genomics, Inc. platform was more conservative (fewer variants called) compared to the Illumina platform, but also demonstrated relatively greater numbers of false positives that needed to be filtered. Quality control procedures also permitted detection of novel genome reads that are not mapped to current reference or alternate assemblies. After stringent quality control, the population-specific reference panel produced more accurate and comprehensive imputation results relative to publicly available, large cosmopolitan reference panels. The population-specific reference panel also permitted enhanced filtering of clinically irrelevant variants from personal genomes.\\n\\nConclusionsOur primary results demonstrate enhanced accuracy of a population-specific imputation panel relative to cosmopolitan panels, especially in the range of infrequent (<5% non-reference allele frequency) and rare (<1% non-reference allele frequency) variants that may be most critical to further progress in mapping of complex phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "P-selectin (PSel) expressed on activated endothelia and platelets supports recruitment of leukocytes expressing PSel ligand (PSelL) to sites of inflammation. While monitoring PSelL expression on activated CD8+ T cells (Tact) in adoptive transfer models, we observed two distinct PSelL on responding donor cells, the canonical cell-intrinsic PSelL PSGL1 and a second undocumented PSelL provisionally named PSL2. PSL2 is unusual among selectin ligands in that it is cell-extrinsic, loaded onto L-selectin (LSel) expressed by Tact but not LSel on resting naive CD8+ T cells. PSL2 expression is highest on Tact responding in peripheral lymph nodes and low on Tact responding in spleen suggesting that the original source of PSL2 is high endothelial venules, cells known to produce LSelL. When both PSGL1 and PSL2 were absent from the surface of Tact, no significant residual PSelL activity was detected. PSL2 is a ligand for both PSel and LSel and can physically bridge the two selectins. The LSel/PSL2 complex can mediate PSel-dependent adherence of Tact to immobilized PSel-hIgG or to activated platelets, either independently or cooperatively with PSGL1. PSel engagement of PSGL1 and LSel/PSL2 would likely deliver distinct signals known to be relevant in leukocyte recruitment.\\n\\nOne sentence summaryMurine primary in-vivo activated CD8+ T cells express two ligands for P-selectin, canonical PSGL-1 and a cell-extrinsic ligand docked on L-selectin.",

    "abstract": "Tuning curves characterizing the response selectivities of biological neurons often exhibit large degrees of irregularity and diversity across neurons. Theoretical network models that feature heterogeneous cell populations or random connectivity also give rise to diverse tuning curves. However, a general framework for fitting such models to experimentally measured tuning curves is lacking. We address this problem by proposing to view mechanistic network models as generative models whose parameters can be optimized to fit the distribution of experimentally measured tuning curves. A major obstacle for fitting such models is that their likelihood function is not explicitly available or is highly intractable to compute. Recent advances in machine learning provide ways for fitting generative models without the need to evaluate the likelihood and its gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) provide one such framework which has been successful in traditional machine learning tasks. We apply this approach in two separate experiments, showing how GANs can be used to fit commonly used mechanistic models in theoretical neuroscience to datasets of measured tuning curves. This fitting procedure avoids the computationally expensive step of inferring latent variables, e.g., the biophysical parameters of individual cells or the particular realization of the full synaptic connectivity matrix, and directly learns model parameters which characterize the statistics of connectivity or of single-cell properties. Another strength of this approach is that it fits the entire, joint distribution of experimental tuning curves, instead of matching a few summary statistics picked a priori by the user. More generally, this framework opens the door to fitting theoretically motivated dynamical network models directly to simultaneously or non-simultaneously recorded neural responses.",

    "abstract": "The Goldbeter-Koshland model has been a paradigm for ultrasensitivity in biological networks for more than 30 years. Despite its simplicity the validity of this model is restricted to conditions when the substrate is in excess over the converter enzymes - a condition that is easy to satisfy in vitro, but which is rarely satisfied in vivo. Here, we analyze the Goldbeter-Koshland model by means of the total quasi-steady state approximation which yields a comprehensive classification of the steady state operating regimes under conditions when the enzyme concentrations are comparable to or larger than that of the substrate. Where possible we derive simple expressions characterizing the input-output behavior of the system. Our analysis suggests that enhanced sensitivity occurs if the concentration of at least one of the converter enzymes is smaller (but not necessarily much smaller) than that of the substrate and if that enzyme is saturated. Conversely, if both enzymes are saturated and at least one of the enzyme concentrations exceeds that of the substrate the system exhibits concentration robustness with respect to changes in that enzyme concentration. Also, depending on the enzymes saturation degrees and the ratio between their maximal reaction rates the total fraction of phosphorylated substrate may increase, decrease or change nonmonotonically as a function of the total substrate concentration. The latter finding may aid the interpretation of experiments involving genetic manipulations of enzyme and substrate abundances.",

It is unclear how many cis-regulatory elements exist, where these elements lie relative to promoters, and how these features are conserved across plant species. We employed the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) in four plant species (Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, Solanum lycopersicum, and Oryza sativa) to delineate open chromatin regions and transcription factor (TF) binding sites across each genome. Despite 10-fold variation in intergenic space among species, the majority of open chromatin regions lie within 3 kb upstream of a transcription start site in all species. We find a common set of four TFs that appear to regulate conserved gene sets in the root tips of all four species, suggesting that TF-gene networks are generally conserved. Comparative ATAC-seq profiling of Arabidopsis root hair and non-hair cell types revealed extensive similarity as well as many cell type-specific differences. Analyzing TF binding sites in differentially accessible regions identified a MYB-driven regulatory module unique to the hair cell, which appears to control both cell fate regulators and abiotic stress responses. Our analyses revealed common regulatory principles among species and shed light on the mechanisms producing cell type-specific transcriptomes during development.",
