    "abstract": "Genetic diversity plays a central role in tumor progression, metastasis, and resistance to treatment. Experiments are shedding light on this diversity at ever finer scales, but interpretation is challenging. Using recent progress in numerical models, we simulate macroscopic tumors to investigate the interplay between growth dynamics, microscopic composition, and circulating tumor cell cluster diversity. We find that modest differences in growth parameters can profoundly change microscopic diversity. Simple outwards expansion leads to spatially segregated clones and low diversity, as expected. However, a modest cell turnover can result in an increased number of divisions and mixing among clones resulting in increased microscopic diversity in the tumor core. Using simulations to estimate power to detect such spatial trends, we find that multiregion sequencing data from contemporary studies is marginally powered to detect the predicted effects. Slightly larger samples, improved detection of rare variants, or sequencing of smaller biopsies or circulating tumor cell clusters would allow one to distinguish between leading models of tumor evolution. The genetic composition of circulating tumor cell clusters, which can be obtained from non-invasive blood draws, is therefore informative about tumor evolution and its metastatic potential.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LINumerical and theoretical models show interaction of front expansion, mutation, and clonal mixing in shaping tumor heterogeneity.\\nC_LIO_LICell turnover increases intratumor heterogeneity.\\nC_LIO_LISimulated circulating tumor cell clusters and microbiopsies exhibit substantial diversity with strong spatial trends.\\nC_LIO_LISimulations suggest attainable sampling schemes able to distinguish between prevalent tumor growth models.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an interactive visualization interface--HiPiler--for the exploration and visualization of regions-of-interest in large genome interaction matrices. Genome interaction matrices approximate the physical distance of pairs of regions on the genome to each other and can contain up to 3 million rows and columns with many sparse regions. Regions of interest (ROIs) can be defined, e.g., by sets of adjacent rows and columns, or by specific visual patterns in the matrix. However, traditional matrix aggregation or pan-and-zoom interfaces fail in supporting search, inspection, and comparison of ROIs in such large matrices. In HiPiler, ROIs are first-class objects, represented as thumbnail-like \\\"snippets\\\". Snippets can be interactively explored and grouped or laid out automatically in scatterplots, or through dimension reduction methods. Snippets are linked to the entire navigable genome interaction matrix through brushing and linking. The design of HiPiler is based on a series of semi-structured interviews with 10 domain experts involved in the analysis and interpretation of genome interaction matrices. We describe six exploration tasks that are crucial for analysis of interaction matrices and demonstrate how HiPiler supports these tasks. We report on a user study with a series of data exploration sessions with domain experts to assess the usability of HiPiler as well as to demonstrate respective findings in the data.",

    "abstract": "The majority of diseases that are a significant challenge for public and individual heath are caused by a combination of hereditary and environmental factors. In this paper we introduce Lineage, a novel visual analysis tool designed to support domain experts who study such multifactorial diseases in the context of genealogies. Incorporating familial relationships between cases with other data can provide insights into shared genomic variants and shared environmental exposures that may be implicated in such diseases. We introduce a data and task abstraction, and argue that the problem of analyzing such diseases based on genealogical, clinical, and genetic data can be mapped to a multivariate graph visualization problem. The main contribution of our design study is a novel visual representation for tree-like, multivariate graphs, which we apply to genealogies and clinical data about the individuals in these families. We introduce data-driven aggregation methods to scale to multiple families. By designing the genealogy graph layout to align with a tabular view, we are able to incorporate extensive, multivariate attributes in the analysis of the genealogy without cluttering the graph. We validate our designs by conducting case studies with our domain collaborators.",

    "abstract": "Genetic connectedness refers to a measure of genetic relatedness across management units (e.g., herds and flocks). With the presence of high genetic connectedness in management units, best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) is known to provide reliable comparisons between genetic values. Genetic connectedness has been studied for pedigree-based BLUP; however, relatively little attention has been paid to using genomic information to measure connectedness. In this study, we assessed genome-based connectedness across management units by applying prediction error variance of difference (PEVD), coefficient of determination (CD), and prediction error correlation (r) to a combination of computer simulation and real data (mice and cattle). We found that genomic information (G) increased the estimate of connectedness among individuals from different management units compared to that based on pedigree (A). A disconnected design benefited the most. In both datasets, PEVD and CD statistics inferred increased connectedness across units when using G- rather than A-based relatedness suggesting stronger connectedness. With r once using allele frequencies equal to one-half or scaling G to values between 0 and 2, which is intrinsic to A, connectedness also increased with genomic information. However, PEVD occasionally increased, and r decreased when obtained using the alternative form of G, instead suggesting less connectedness. Such inconsistencies were not found with CD. We contend that genomic relatedness strengthens measures of genetic connectedness across units and has the potential to aid genomic evaluation of livestock species.\\n\\nThe problem of connectedness or disconnectedness is particularly important in genetic evaluation of managed populations such as domesticated livestock. When selecting among animals from different management units (e.g., herds and flocks), caution is needed; choosing one animal over others across management units may be associated with greater uncertainty than selection within management units. Such uncertainty is reduced if individuals from different management units are genetically linked or connected. In such a case, best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) offers meaningful comparison of the breeding values across management units for genetic evaluation (e.g., Kuehn et al., 2007).\\n\\nStructures of breeding programs have a direct influence on levels of connectedness. Wide use of artificial insemination (AI) programs generally increases genetic connectedness across management units. For example, dairy cattle populations are considered highly connected due to dissemination of genetic material from a small number of highly selected sires. The situation may be different for species with less use of AI and more use of natural service mating such as for beef cattle or sheep populations. Under these scenarios, the magnitude of connectedness across management units is reduced and genetic links are largely confined within management units.\\n\\nPedigree-based genetic connectedness has been evaluated and applied in practice (e.g., Kuehn et al., 2009; Eikje and Lewis, 2015). However, there is a relative paucity of use of genomic information such as single nucletide polymorphisms (SNPs) to ascertain connectedness. It still remains elusive in what scenarios genomics can strengthen connectedness and how much gain can be expected relative to use of pedigree information alone. Connectedness statistics have been used to optimize selective genotyping and phenotyping in simulated livestock (Pszczola et al., 2012) and plant populations (Maenhout et al., 2010), and in real maize (Rincent et al., 2012; Isidro et al., 2015), and real rice data (Isidro et al., 2015). These studies concluded that the greater the connectedness between the reference and validation populations, the greater the predictive performance. However, 1) connectedness among different management units and 2) differences in connectedness measures between pedigree and genomic relatedness were not explored in those studies. For better understanding of genome-based connectedness, it is critical to examine how the presence of management units comes into play. For instance, genomic relatedness provides relationships between distant individuals that appear disconnected according to the pedigree information. In addition, it captures Mendelian sampling that is not present in pedigree relationships (Hill and Weir, 2011). Thus, genomic information is expected to strengthen measures of connectedness, which in turn refines comparisons of genetic values across different management units. The objective of this study was to assess measures of genetic connectedness across management units with use of genomic information. We leveraged the combination of real data and computer simulation to compare gains in measures of connectedness when moving from pedigree to genomic relationships. First, we studied a heterogenous mice dataset stratified by cage. Then we investigated approaches to measure connectedness using real cattle data coupled with simulated management units to have greater control over the degree of confounding between fixed management groups and genetic relationships.",

    "abstract": "Public health agencies are increasingly relying on genomics during Legionnaires disease investigations. However, the causative bacterium (Legionella pneumophila) has an unusual population structure with extreme temporal and spatial genome sequence conservation. Furthermore, Legionnaires disease outbreaks can be caused by multiple L. pneumophila genotypes in a single source. These factors can confound cluster identification using standard phylogenomic methods. Here, we show that a statistical learning approach based on\\n\\nL. pneumophila core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) comparisons eliminates ambiguity for defining outbreak clusters and accurately predicts exposure sources for clinical cases. We illustrate the performance of our method by genome comparisons of 234 L. pneumophila isolates obtained from patients and cooling towers in Melbourne, Australia between 1994 and 2014. This collection included one of the largest reported Legionnaires disease outbreaks, involving 125 cases at an aquarium. Using only sequence data from L. pneumophila cooling tower isolates and including all core genome variation, we built a multivariate model using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) to find cooling tower-specific genomic signatures, and then used it to predict the origin of clinical isolates. Model assignments were 93% congruent with epidemiological data, including the aquarium Legionnaires outbreak and three other unrelated outbreak investigations. We applied the same approach to a recently described investigation of Legionnaires disease within a UK hospital and observed model predictive ability of 86%. We have developed a promising means to breach L. pneumophila genetic diversity extremes and provide objective source attribution data for outbreak investigations.",

    "abstract": "The latent period is a crucial life history trait, particularly for polycyclic plant diseases, because it determines how many complete monocycles could theoretically occur during an epidemic. Many empirical studies have focused on the variation of the latent period with pathogen or host genotype, or changes in response to environmental factors. The focus on these aspects is unsurprising, as these factors classically form the three parts of the epidemiological triangle. Experiments in controlled conditions are generally used to assess pathogenicity and host susceptibility, and also provide the opportunity to measure the distribution of latent periods in epidemiological systems. Once estimated for one or several pairs of host-pathogen genotypes, the mean value of this important trait is usually considered to be fixed and is often used \\\"as is\\\" in epidemiological models. We show here that the latent period can display non-negligible variability over the course of a disease epidemic, and that this variability has multiple sources, some of which have complex, antagonistic impacts. We develop arguments for four sources of variation that challenge the implicit assumption that the latent period remains constant: daily fluctuations in leaf temperature, nature of inoculum, host stage or age of host tissues, intra-population competition and selection for aggressiveness traits. We focus on the wheat fungal disease Septoria tritici blotch (Zymoseptoria tritici), making use of empirical datasets collected during the first authors own research projects and a targeted literature review. Such empirical epidemiological knowledge is new and potentially important for modelers. While some studies have demonstrated that the distribution of latent periods around the mean value has consequences for epidemiological dynamics, we show that it might also be important for epidemiological modelers to account for changes in this mean value during an annual epidemic. These results may be of critical importance for improving outbreak forecasting.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 80% of all recent sponge species belong to the class Demospongiae. Yet, despite their diversity and importance, accurate divergence times are still unknown for most demosponge clades. The estimation of demosponge divergence time is key to answering fundamental questions like e.g. the origin of Demospongiae, their diversification and historical biogeography. Molecular sequence data alone is not informative on an absolute time scale, and therefore needs to be \\\"calibrated\\\" with additional data such as fossils. Here, we apply the fossilized birth-death model (FBD), which has the advantage, compared to strict node dating with the oldest fossil occurrences, that it allows for the inclusion of young and old fossils in the analysis of divergence time. We use desma-bearing sponges, a diverse group of demosponges that form rigid skeletons and have a rich and continuous fossil record dating back to the Cambrian ([~]500 Ma), aiming to date the demosponge radiation and constrain the timing of key evolutionary events, like the transition from marine to freshwater habitats. To do so, we assembled mitochondrial genomes of six desma-bearing demosponges from size-selected reduced-representation genomic libraries and apply a fossilized birth-death model including 30 fossils and 33 complete demosponge mitochondrial genomes to infer a dated phylogeny of Demospongiae. Our study supports a Neoproterozoic origin of Demospongiae. Novel age estimates for the split of freshwater and marine sponges dating back to the Carboniferous and the previously assumed Recent ([~]18 Ma) diversification of freshwater sponges is supported. Moreover, we provide detailed age estimates for a possible diversification of Tetractinellidae ([~]315 Ma), the Astrophorina ([~]240 Ma), the Spirophorina ([~]120 Ma) and the family Corallistidae ([~]188 Ma) all of which are considered as key groups for dating the Demospongiae, due to their extraordinary rich and continuous fossil history.",

    "abstract": "In vitro cell culture is routinely used to grow and supply a sufficiently large number of cells for various types of cell biology experiments. Previous experimental studies report that cell characteristics evolve as the passage number increases, and various cell lines can behave differently at high passage numbers. To provide insight into the putative mechanisms that might give rise to these differences, we perform in silico experiments using a random walk model to mimic the in vitro cell culture process. Our results show that it is possible for the average proliferation rate to either increase or decrease as the passaging process takes place, and this is due to a competition between the initial heterogeneity and the degree to which passaging damages the cells. We also simulate a suite of scratch assays with cells from near-homogeneous and heterogeneous cell lines, at both high and low passage numbers. Although it is common in the literature to report experimental results without disclosing the passage number, our results show that we obtain significantly different closure rates when performing in silico scratch assays using cells with different passage numbers. Therefore, we suggest that the passage number should always be reported to ensure that the experiment is as reproducible as possible. Furthermore, our modelling also suggests some avenues for further experimental examination that could be used to validate or refine our simulation results.",

    "abstract": "There was a long standing contradiction between formulations of the competitive exclusion principle and natural species richness, which is known as the biodiversity paradox. Here we investigate a role of fitness differences in coexistence of two completely competing species using individual-based cellular automata. According to the classical formulations of the competitive exclusion principle such coexistence is impossible. Earlier we found that coexistence of complete competitors is possible with a 100% difference in fitness, but only under certain initial conditions. Here we verify a hypothesis that completely competing species may coexist with less than 100% difference in fitness regardless of different initial location of competing individuals in the ecosystem. We have found a new fact that two aggressively propagating complete competitors can stably coexist in one limited, stable and homogeneous habitat, when one species has some advantage in fitness over the other and all other characteristics of the species are equal, in particular any trade-offs and cooperations are absent. This fact is established theoretically on the rigorous model. The found competitive coexistence occurred regardless of the initial location of individuals in the ecosystem. When colonization of free habitat started from a single individual of each species, then the complete competitors coexisted up to 31% of their difference in fitness. And when on initial stage half of the territory was probabilistically occupied, the complete competitors coexisted up to 22% of their difference in fitness. These results additionally support our reformulation of the competitive exclusion principle, which we consider as resolving of the biodiversity paradox.",

Here we investigated this question in a set of planktonic lake microbiotas in Eastern Antarctica that represent a natural community ecology experiment. Most of the analysed lakes emerged from the sea during the last 6,000 years, giving rise to waterbodies that originally contained marine microbiotas and that subsequently evolved into habitats ranging from freshwater to hypersaline. We show that habitat diversification has promoted environmental selection driven by a salinity gradient in prokaryotes and ecological drift in microeukaryotes. Nevertheless, we detected also a number of microeukaryotes with specific responses to salinity, indicating that albeit minor, environmental selection has had a role in the assembly of their communities. Altogether, we conclude that habitat diversification can promote contrasting responses in planktonic microeukaryotes and prokaryotes belonging to the same communities.",

We observe similar mutational signatures across cancer types, suggesting powerful endogenous mutational processes in mitochondria. Truncating mutations are remarkably enriched in kidney, colorectal and thyroid cancers and associated with the activation of critical signaling pathways. We find frequent somatic nuclear transfers of mitochondrial DNA (especially in skin and lung cancers), some of which disrupt therapeutic target genes (e.g., ERBB2).

    "abstract": "The growing human population and a changing environment have raised significant concern for global food security, with the current improvement rate of several important crops inadequate to meet future demand [1]. This slow improvement rate is attributed partly to the long generation times of crop plants. Here we present a method called  speed breeding, which greatly shortens generation time and accelerates breeding and research programs. Speed breeding can be used to achieve up to 6 generations per year for spring wheat (Triticum aestivum), durum wheat (T. durum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), chickpea (Cicer arietinum), and pea (Pisum sativum) and 4 generations for canola (Brassica napus), instead of 2-3 under normal glasshouse conditions. We demonstrate that speed breeding in fully-enclosed controlled-environment growth chambers can accelerate plant development for research purposes, including phenotyping of adult plant traits, mutant studies, and transformation. The use of supplemental lighting in a glasshouse environment allows rapid generation cycling through single seed descent and potential for adaptation to larger-scale crop improvement programs. Cost-saving through LED supplemental lighting is also outlined. We envisage great potential for integrating speed breeding with other modern crop breeding technologies, including high-throughput genotyping, genome editing, and genomic selection, accelerating the rate of crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "The RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9 has emerged as a powerful new tool for genome engineering. Cas9 creates targeted double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the genome. Knock-in of specific mutations (precision genome editing) requires homology-directed repair (HDR) of the DSB by synthetic donor DNAs containing the desired edits, but HDR has been reported to be variably efficient. Here, we report that linear DNAs (single and double-stranded) engage in a high-efficiency HDR mechanism that requires only [~]35 nucleotides of homology with the targeted locus to introduce edits ranging from 1 to 1000 nucleotides. We demonstrate the utility of linear donors by introducing fluorescent protein tags in human cells and mouse embryos using PCR fragments. We find that repair is local, polarity-sensitive, and prone to template switching, characteristics that are consistent with gene conversion by synthesis-dependent strand-annealing (SDSA). Our findings enable rational design of synthetic donor DNAs for efficient genome editing.\\n\\nSignificanceGenome editing, the introduction of precise changes in the genome, is revolutionizing our ability to decode the genome. Here we describe a simple method for genome editing that takes advantage of an efficient mechanism for DNA repair called synthesis-dependent strand annealing. We demonstrate that synthetic linear DNAs (ssODNs and PCR fragments) with [~]35bp homology arms function as efficient donors for SDSA repair of Cas9-induced double-strand breaks. Edits from 1 to 1000 base pairs can be introduced in the genome without cloning or selection.",

    "abstract": "Termite mounds are often cited as an example of efficient thermoregulated structures. Nest thermal stability can be critical for insects that are particularly sensitive to heat and desiccation. Few studies have measured internal temperature of termite nests with respect to environmental parameters, especially in Neotropical species. In this study, we analyzed the thermal profiles of different parts of Procornitermes araujoi nests, a neotropical mound-building termite of the Brazilian cerrado. To read into our dataset we first used rasterization, a method that allows a quick-look assessment of time-series. Our results show that nest architecture efficiently buffers against environmental temperature fluctuations while at the same time maintaining a relatively high internal temperature in the core. This rather stable internal climate follows nevertheless the external temperature long-term averages. Using a novel numerical scheme, we further show that the heat transfer dynamics are well described by the classical heat equation, with an additional heat source whose origin is discussed.",

    "abstract": "The recent rapid proliferation of novel taxon identification in the Zoanthidea has been accompanied by a parallel propagation of gene trees as a tool of species discovery, but not a corresponding increase in our understanding of phylogeny. This disparity is caused by the trade-off between the capabilities of automated DNA sequence alignment and data content of genes applied to phylogenetic inference in this group. Conserved genes or segments are easily aligned across the order, but produce poorly resolved trees; hypervariable genes or segments contain the evolutionary signal necessary for resolution and robust support, but sequence alignment is daunting. Staggered alignments are a form of phylogeny-informed sequence alignment composed of a mosaic of local and universal regions that allow phylogenetic inference to be applied to all nucleotides from both hypervariable and conserved gene segments. Comparisons between species tree phylogenies inferred from all data (staggered alignment) and hypervariable-excluded data (standard alignment) demonstrate improved confidence and greater topological agreement with other sources of data for the complete-data tree. This novel phylogeny is the most comprehensive to date (in terms of taxa and data) and can serve as an expandable tool for evolutionary hypothesis testing in the Zoanthidea.\\n\\nResumenSpanish language translation by Lisbeth O.

Esta disparidad, es causada por la competencia entre la capacidad de los alineamientos de secuencia del acido desoxirribonucleico (ADN) automatizados y la informacion contenida en los datos de genes que se aplican a los metodos de inferencia filogenetica en este grupo de Zoanthidea. Las regiones o segmentos de genes conservados son facilmente alineados dentro del orden; sin embargo, producen arboles de genes con resultados pauperrimos; ademas, aunque estas regiones hipervariables de genes o segmentos contienen las senas evolutivas necesarias para apoyar la construccion robusta y completa de arboles filogeneticos, estos genes producen alineamientos de secuencia abrumadores. Los alineamientos escalonados de secuencias son una forma de alineamientos informados por la filogenia y compuestos de un mosaico de regiones locales y universales que permiten que inferencias filogeneticas sean aplicadas a todos los nucleotidos de regiones hipervariables y de genes o segmentos conservados.

Here, we describe an accurate and high-coverage repertoire sequencing method, MIDCIRS, which uses as few as 1,000 naive B cells. Using it, we studied age-related antibody repertoire development and diversification before and during acute malaria in infants (< 12 months old) and toddlers (12 - 47 months old) with 4-8 ml of blood draws. Unexpectedly, we discovered high levels of somatic hypermutation (SHM) in infants as young as three months old. Antibody clonal lineage analysis revealed that both infants and toddlers increase SHM levels upon infection and memory B cells isolated from pre-malaria samples in malaria-experienced individuals continue to induce SHMs upon malaria rechallenge. These results highlight the vast potential of antibody repertoire diversification in infants and toddlers that has not been realized previously.",

This formulation is problematic for two reasons: First, cognitive maps are traditionally conceptualized to generalize over individual episodes, which conflicts with evidence associating the hippocampus with episodic memory, and second, it fails to explain seemingly non-hippocampal forms of planning. Here we propose a novel theoretical framework that resolves these issues: each long-term memory system is a cognitive map, predicting consequences of actions based on its unique computational properties. It follows that hippocampal maps are episode-based and that semantic, procedural, and Pavlovian memories each implement a specialized map. We present evidence for each type of map from neuropsychology, neuroimaging and animal electrophysiology studies.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput techniques allow for massive screening of drug combinations. To find combinations that exhibit an interaction effect, one filters for promising compound combinations by comparing to a response without interaction. A common principle for no interaction is Loewe Additivity which is based on the assumption that no compound interacts with itself and that doses of both compounds for a given effect are equivalent. For the model to be consistent, the doses of both compounds have to be proportional. We call this restriction the Loewe Additivity Consistency Condition (LACC). We derive explicit and implicit null reference models from the Loewe Additivity principle that are equivalent when the LACC holds. Of these two formulations, the implicit formulation is the known General Isobole Equation [1], whereas the explicit one is the novel contribution. The LACC is violated in a significant number of cases. In this scenario the models make different predictions. We analyze two data sets of drug screening that are non-interactive [2, 3] and show that the LACC is mostly violated and Loewe Additivity not defined. Further, we compare the measurements of the non-interactive cases of both data sets to the theoretical null reference models in terms of bias and mean squared error. We demonstrate that the explicit formulation of the null reference model leads to smaller mean squared errors than the implicit one and is much faster to compute.",

    "abstract": "Engineered heterologous metabolic pathways can convert low-cost feedstock into high-value products, though it remains a significant challenge to reliably and efficiently maximize end-product biosynthesis, particularly when many enzymes must be co-expressed together. When current approaches are applied to many-enzyme pathways, the construction and characterization process is highly iterative and laborious, while generating high-dimensional datasets that remain difficult to analyze for forward engineering efforts. To overcome these challenges, we developed a new algorithm that determines the highly non-linear and high-dimensional relationship between a pathways enzyme expression levels and its end-product productivity from common characterization of a small number of heterologous pathway variants. We combined kinetic metabolic modeling, elementary mode analysis, model reduction, de-dimensionalization, and genetic algorithm optimization into an automated procedure that parameterizes accurate kinetic metabolic models from sparsely characterized pathway variant libraries with varied enzyme expression levels. The resulting Pathway Maps are used to determine rate-limiting steps, predict optimal expression levels, identify allosteric interactions, rank-order enzyme kinetics, and prioritize protein engineering efforts. We demonstrate the Pathway Map Calculator algorithm on two experimental datasets, a 3-enzyme carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and a 9-enzyme limonene biosynthesis pathway, as well as a series of in silico pathway examples to rigorously demonstrate the algorithms accuracy, linear scaling, and high tolerance to measurement noise.

    "abstract": "The growth and survival of organisms often depend on interactions between them. In many cases, these interactions are positive and caused by a cooperative modification of the environment, such as the cooperative breakdown of complex nutrients in microbes [1]-[3] or the construction of elaborate architectures in social insects [4]. However, organisms can similarly display negative interactions by changing the environment in ways that are detrimental for them, eg by resource depletion or the production of toxic byproducts [5]. Here we find an extreme type of negative interactions, in which bacteria modify the environmental pH to such a degree that it leads to a rapid extinction of the whole population, a phenomenon we call ecological suicide. Modification of the pH is more pronounced at higher population densities, and thus ecological suicide is more likely with increasing bacterial density. Correspondingly, promoting bacterial growth can drive populations extinct whereas inhibiting bacterial growth by the addition of harmful substances - like antibiotics - can rescue them. Moreover, ecological suicide can cause oscillatory dynamics, even in single-species populations. We find ecological suicide in a wide variety of microbes, suggesting that it could play a significant role in microbial ecology and evolution.",

A force sensor with a 50 nN-1mN detection sensitively allowed us to measure quantitatively the stress-strain characteristics of native silk threads in both the original dry state and after wetting by controlled application of water mist with droplet sizes ranging between 3 and 5 m and densities ranging between 104 and 105 per mm3. Stress forces of between 1 and 5 N/m2 in the native, dry multifilament thread puffs were reduced to between 0.1 and 0.5 N/m2 in the wetted collapsed state, with strain displacements reducing from between 2 and 5 mm in the dry to 0.10-0.12mm in the wetted states. We conclude that wetting cribellate threads reduce their van der Waals adhesion with implications on the threads adhesive strength under tension. This should be considered when discussing the evolutionary transitions of capture silks from the ancestral dry-state nanofilaments of the cribellate spider taxa to the wet-state glue droplets of the ecribellate taxa.",

    "abstract": "Dimethylsulfide (DMS) is released at rates of >107 tons annually and plays a key role in the oceanic sulfur cycle and ecology. Marine bacteria, algae, and possibly other organisms, release DMS via cleavage of dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Different genes encoding proteins with DMSP lyase activity are known belonging to different superfamilies and exhibiting highly variable levels of DMSP lyase activity. DddY shows the highest activity among all reported bacterial lyases yet is poorly characterized. Here, we describe the characterization of recombinant DddY is from different marine bacteria. We found that DddY activity demands a transition metal ion cofactor. DddY also shares two sequence motifs with other bacterial lyases assigned as cupin-like enzymes, DddQ, DddL, DddK, and DddW. These cupin motif residues are essential for DddY activity, as for the other cupin DMSP lyases, and all these enzymes are characterized by a common metal-chelator inhibitor (TPEN). Analysis of all sequences carrying these cupin motifs defined a superfamily: Cupin-DLL (DMSP lyases and lyase-like). The DMSP lyase families are sporadically distributed suggesting that DMSP lyases evolved within this superfamily independently along multiple lineages. However, the specific activity levels, genomic context analysis, and systematic profiling of substrate selectivity as described in the accompanying paper, indicate that for only some of these families, most distinctly DddY and DddL, DMSP lyase is the primary, native activity. In other families, foremost DddQ, DMSP lyase seems to be merely a promiscuous activity. The native function of DddQ, and of nearly all members of this newly identified Cupin-DLL superfamily, remains unknown.\\n\\nAbbreviations\\n\\nFundingFinancial support by the Estate of Mark Scher, and the Sasson & Marjorie Peress Philanthropic Fund, are gratefully acknowledged.

    "abstract": "Decoding the spatial organizations of chromosomes has crucial implications for studying eukaryotic gene regulation. Recently, Chromosomal conformation capture based technologies, such as Hi-C, have been widely used to uncover the interaction frequencies of genomic loci in high-throughput and genome-wide manner and provide new insights into the folding of three-dimensional (3D) genome structure. In this paper, we develop a novel manifold learning framework, called GEM (Genomic organization reconstructor based on conformational Energy and Manifold learning), to elucidate the underlying 3D spatial organizations of chromosomes from Hi-C data. Unlike previous chromatin structure reconstruction methods, which explicitly assume specific relationships between Hi-C interaction frequencies and spatial distances between distal genomic loci, GEM is able to reconstruct an ensemble of chromatin conformations by directly embedding the neigh-boring affinities from Hi-C space into 3D Euclidean space based on a manifold learning strategy that considers both the fitness of Hi-C data and the biophysical feasibility of the modeled structures, which are measured by the conformational energy derived from our current biophysical knowledge about the 3D polymer model. Extensive validation tests on both simulated interaction frequency data and experimental Hi-C data of yeast and human demonstrated that GEM not only greatly outperformed other state-of-art modeling methods but also reconstructed accurate chromatin structures that agreed well with the hold-out or independent Hi-C data and sparse geometric restraints derived from the previous fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies. In addition, as GEM can generate accurate spatial organizations of chromosomes by integrating both experimentally-derived spatial contacts and conformational energy, we for the first time extended our modeling method to recover long-range genomic interactions that are missing from the original Hi-C data. All these results indicated that GEM can provide a physically and physiologically valid 3D representations of the organizations of chromosomes and thus serve as an effective and useful genome structure reconstructor.",

    "abstract": "Environments can change in incremental fashions, where a shift from one state to another occurs over multiple organismal generations. The rate at which the environment changes is expected to influence how and how well populations adapt to the ultimate environment. We used a model system, the lytic RNA bacteriophage {Phi}6, to investigate this question empirically. We evolved viruses for thermostability by exposing them to heat shocks that increased to a maximum temperature at different rates. We observed increases in the ability of many heat-shocked populations to survive high temperature heat shocks, and on their first exposure to the highest temperature, populations that experienced a gradual increase in temperature had higher average survival than populations that experienced a rapid temperature increase. However, at the end of the experiment, neither the survival of populations at the highest temperature nor the number of mutations per population varied significantly according to the rate of thermal change. We also evaluated mutations from the endpoint populations for their effects on viral thermostability and growth. As expected, some mutations did increase viral thermostability. However, other mutations decreased thermostability but increased growth rate, suggesting that benefits of an increased replication rate may have sometimes outweighed the benefits of enhanced thermostability. Our study highlights the importance of considering the effects of multiple selective pressures, even in environments where a single factor is changing.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a clinically heterogeneous disorder. Proposed revisions in DSM - 5 included dimensional measurement of different symptom domains. We sought to identify common genetic variants influencing these dimensions, and confirm a previous association between polygenic risk of schizophrenia and the severity of negative symptoms. The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium study of schizophrenia comprised 8,432 cases of European ancestry with available clinical phenotype data. Symptoms averaged over the course of illness were assessed using the OPCRIT, PANSS, LDPS, SCAN, SCID, and CASH. Factor analyses of each constituent PGC study identified positive, negative, manic, and depressive symptom dimensions. We examined the relationship between the resultant symptom dimensions and aggregate polygenic risk scores indexing risk of schizophrenia. We performed genome - wide association study (GWAS) of each quantitative traits using linear regression and adjusting for significant effects of sex and ancestry. The negative symptom factor was significantly associated with polygene risk scores for schizophrenia, confirming a previous, suggestive finding by our group in a smaller sample, though explaining only a small fraction of the variance. In subsequent GWAS, we observed the strongest evidence of association for the positive and negative symptom factors, with SNPs in RFX8 on 2q11.2 (P = 6.27x10-8) and upstream of WDR72 / UNC13C on 15q21.3 (P = 7.59x10-8), respectively. We report evidence of association of novel modifier loci for schizophrenia, though no single locus attained established genome - wide significance criteria. As this may have been due to insufficient statistical power, follow - up in additional samples is warranted. Importantly, we replicated our previous finding that polygenic risk explains at least some of the variance in negative symptoms, a core illness dimension.",

    "abstract": "A wild non-progenitor species from wheat tertiary gene pool Aegilops peregrina accession pau3519 (UUSS) was used for introgression of leaf rust and stripe rust resistance in bread wheat. It was crossed and backcrossed with hexaploid wheat line Chinese Spring PhI to develop two homozygous BC2F6 wheat-Ae. peregrina introgression lines (ILs) viz. IL pau16058 and IL pau16061 through induced homoeologous recombination. Homozygous lines were screened against six Puccinia triticina and two Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici pathotypes at the seedling stage and a mixture of prevalent pathotypes of both rust pathogens at the adult plant stage. IL pau16061 showed resistance to leaf rust only while IL pau16058 was resistant to both leaf and stripe rust pathotypes throughout plant life. Molecular characterization of these ILs aided in defining the introgressed regions. Identification of linked markers with advance genomic technologies will aid in marker assisted pyramiding of alien genes in cultivated wheat background.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION EXPERIMENTAL METHODS OBSERVATIONS DISCUSSION ELECTODERMOGRAM MECHANISM CONCLUDING REMARKS REFERENCES It is an engaging thought that the great sense organs concentrated in the head region of vertebrates were all derived from primitive systems of widely diffused skin receptors. In this sense, one can think of the receptors of hearing as derived from cutaneous touch spots, with which they share many physiological properties; the organ of equilibrium the cristae of the semicircular canals from deep pressure receptors; smell from chemoreceptors that remain widely distributed over the bodies of the mucous - skinned fishes and amphibia and have withdrawn into the mucous area of the mouth in land vertebrates.
