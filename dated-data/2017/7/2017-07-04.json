    "abstract": "Theories of reward learning in neuroscience have focused on two families of algorithms, thought to capture deliberative vs. habitual choice. \\\"Model-based\\\" algorithms compute the value of candidate actions from scratch, whereas \\\"model-free\\\" algorithms make choice more efficient but less flexible by storing pre-computed action values. We examine an intermediate algorithmic family, the successor representation (SR), which balances flexibility and efficiency by storing partially computed action values: predictions about future events. These pre-computation strategies differ in how they update their choices following changes in a task. SRs reliance on stored predictions about future states predicts a unique signature of insensitivity to changes in the tasks sequence of events, but flexible adjustment following changes to rewards. We provide evidence for such differential sensitivity in two behavioral studies with humans. These results suggest that the SR is a computational substrate for semi-flexible choice in humans, introducing a subtler, more cognitive notion of habit.",

    "abstract": "Animals have evolved to maintain homeostasis in a changing external environment by adapting their internal metabolism and feeding behaviour. Metabolism and behaviour are coordinated by neuromodulation; a number of the implicated neuromodulatory systems are homologous between mammals and the vinegar fly, an important neurogenetic model. We investigated whether silencing fly neuromodulatory networks would elicit coordinated changes in feeding, behavioural activity and metabolism. We employed transgenic lines that allowed us to inhibit broad cellular sets of the dopaminergic, serotonergic, octopaminergic, tyraminergic and neuropeptide F systems. The genetically-manipulated animals were assessed for changes in their overt behavioural responses and metabolism by monitoring eleven parameters: activity; climbing ability; individual feeding; group feeding; food discovery; both fed and starved respiration; fed and starved lipid content; and fed/starved body weight. The results from these 55 experiments indicate that individual neuromodulatory system effects on feeding behaviour, motor activity and metabolism are dissociated.",

    "abstract": "Gq is a heterotrimeric G protein that is widely expressed in neurons and regulates neuronal activity. To identify pathways regulating neuronal Gq signaling we performed a forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans for suppressors of activated Gq. One of the suppressors is an allele of sek-1, which encodes a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) in the p38 MAPK pathway. Here we show that sek-1 mutants have a slow locomotion rate and that sek-1 acts in acetylcholine neurons to modulate both locomotion rate and Gq signaling. Furthermore, we find that sek-1 acts in mature neurons to modulate locomotion. Using genetic and behavioral approaches we demonstrate that other components of the p38 MAPK pathway also play a positive role in modulating locomotion and Gq signaling. Finally, we find that mutants in the SEK-1 p38 MAPK pathway partially suppress an activated mutant of the sodium leak channel NCA-1/NALCN, a downstream target of Gq signaling. Our results suggest that the SEK-1 p38 pathway may modulate the output of Gq signaling through NCA-1.",

    "abstract": "The dinoflagellate-coral partnership influences the coral holobionts tolerance to thermal stress and bleaching. However, the comparative roles of host genetic versus environmental factors in determining the composition of this symbiosis are largely unknown. Here we quantify the heritability of the initial Symbiodinium communities for two broadcast-spawning corals with different symbiont transmission modes: Acropora tenuis has environmental acquisition, whereas Montipora digitata has maternal transmission. Using high throughput sequencing of the ITS-2 region to characterize communities in parents, juveniles and eggs, we describe previously undocumented Symbiodinium diversity and dynamics in both corals. After one month of uptake in the field, Symbiodinium communities associated with A. tenuis juveniles were dominated by A3, C1, D1, A-type CCMP828, and D1a in proportional abundances conserved between experiments in two years. M. digitata eggs were predominantly characterized by C15, D1, and A3. In contrast to current paradigms, host genetic influences accounted for a surprising 29% of phenotypic variation in Symbiodinium communities in the horizontally-transmitting A. tenuis, but only 62% in the vertically-transmitting M. digitata. Our results reveal hitherto unknown flexibility in the acquisition of Symbiodinium communities and substantial heritability in both species, providing material for selection to produce partnerships that are locally adapted to changing environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "After the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident, various surveys have been performed to measure the extent of radioactive contamination in marine sediments, surface waters, plankton, and fish. However, the radioactive contamination of one of the most important ecological niches, biofilms, has not been investigated. Therefore, in this study, we sampled biofilms from sea floor stones around Hisanohama Port, which is less than 30 km south of the accident site, and then analyzed the microbial community structure and element profiles, including those of radioactive elements, of these biofilms in order to determine the accumulation and retention of radioactive elements in them. Our results showed that the biofilm samples contained relatively high levels of radioactive cesium even when the sampling was performed 8-11 months after the accident. Our results also suggested that the structure of the biofilm organismal community is related to the element profile of radioactive cesium. Thus, our study suggests that biofilms are a possible radioactive compound accumulator in the natural environment and that they can retain radioactive material for at least 8-11 months.",

Although mammalian JUMPY negatively regulates autophagy, loss-of-JUMPY causes muscle dysfunction and is associated with a rare genetic disorder called centronuclear myopathy. Here we show that tissue-specific downregulation of EDTP in Drosophila non-muscle tissues, particularly glial cells, suppresses the expression of polyglutamine (polyQ) protein aggregates in the same cells and improves survival. Additionally, tissue-specific downregulation of EDTP in glial cells or motoneurons extends lifespan.

    "abstract": "Neural circuits are wired by chemotactic migration of growth cones guided by extracellular guidance cue gradients. How growth cone chemotaxis builds the macroscopic structure of the neural circuit is a fundamental question in neuroscience. I addressed this issue in the case of the ordered axonal projections called topographic maps in the retinotectal system. In the retina and tectum, the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, are expressed in gradients. According to Sperrys chemoaffinity theory, gradients in both the source and target areas enable projecting axons to recognize their proper terminals, but how axons chemotactically decode their destinations is largely unknown. To identify the chemotactic mechanism of topographic mapping, I developed a mathematical model of intracellular signaling in the growth cone that focuses on the growth cones unique chemotactic property of being attracted or repelled by the same guidance cues in different biological situations. The model presented mechanism by which the retinal growth cone reaches the correct terminal zone in the tectum through alternating chemotactic response between attraction and repulsion around a preferred concentration. The model also provided a unified understanding of the contrasting relationships between receptor expression levels and preferred ligand concentrations in EphA/ephrinA- and EphB/ephrinB-encoded topographic mappings. Thus, this study redefines the chemoaffinity theory in chemotactic terms.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThis study revisited the chemoaffinity theory for topographic mapping in terms of chemotaxis. According to this theory, the axonal growth cone projects to specific targets based on positional information encoded by chemical gradients in both source and target areas. However, the mechanism by which the chemotactic growth cone recognizes its proper terminal site remains elusive. To unravel this mystery, I mathematically modeled a growth cone exhibiting concentration-dependent attraction and repulsion to chemotactic cues. The model identified a novel growth cone guidance mechanism in topographic mapping, highlighting the importance of the growth cones unique ability to alternate between attraction and repulsion. Furthermore, an extension of the model provided possible molecular mechanisms for contrasting two types of topographic mappings observed in the retinotectal system.",

    "abstract": "MotivationFungi are essential in nutrient recycling in nature. They also form symbiotic, commensal, parasitic and pathogenic interactions with other organisms including plants, animals and humans. Many fungi are polykaryotic, containing multiple nuclei per cell. In the case of heterokaryons, there are even different nuclear types within a cell. It is unknown what the different nuclear types contribute in terms of mRNA expression levels in fungal heterokaryons. Each cell of the cultivated, mushroom forming basidiomycete Agaricus bisporus contains 2 to 25 nuclei of two nuclear types, P1 or P2, that originate from two parental strains. Using RNA-Seq data, we wish to assess the differential mRNA contribution of individual nuclear types in heterokaryotic cells and its functional impact.\\n\\nResultsWe studied differential expression between genes of the two nuclear types throughout mushroom development of A. bisporus in various tissue types. The two nuclear types, produced specific mRNA profiles which changed through development of the mushroom. The differential regulation occurred at a gene and multi-gene locus level, rather than the chromosomal or nuclear level. Although the P1 nuclear type dominates the mRNA production throughout development, the P2 type showed more differentially upregulated genes in important functional groups including genes involved in metabolism and genes encoding secreted proteins. Out of 5,090 karyolelle pairs, i.e. genes with different alleles in the two nuclear types, 411 were differentially expressed, of which 246 were up-regulated by the P2 type. In the vegetative mycelium, the P2 nucleus up-regulated almost three-fold more metabolic genes and cazymes than P1, suggesting phenotypic differences in growth. A total of 10% of the differential karyollele expression is associated with differential methylation states, indicating that epigenetic mechanisms may be partly responsible for nuclear specific expression.\\n\\nConclusionWe have identified widespread transcriptomic variation between the two nuclear types of A. bisporus. Our novel method enables studying karyollelle specific expression which likely influences the phenotype of a fungus in a polykaryotic stage. This is thus relevant for the performance of these fungi as a crop and for improving this species for breeding. Our findings could have a wider impact to better understand fungi as pathogens. This work provides the first insight into the transcriptomic variation introduced by genomic nuclear separation.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a debilitating chronic condition, which requires complex and expensive disease management. Exercise has now been recognised as a critical factor in improving health and quality of life in patients with CF. Hence, cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is used to determine aerobic fitness of young patients as part of the clinical management of CF. However, at present there is a lack of conclusive evidence for one limiting system of aerobic fitness for CF patients at an individual patient level.\\n\\nHere, we perform detailed data analysis that allows us to identify important systems-level factors that affect aerobic fitness. We use patients data and principal component analysis to confirm the dependence of CPET performance on variables associated with ventilation and metabolic rates of oxygen consumption. We find that the time at which participants cross the anaerobic threshold (AT) is well correlated with their overall performance. Furthermore, we propose a predictive modelling framework that captures the relationship between ventilatory dynamics, lung capacity and function and performance in CPET within a group of children and adolescents with CF. Specifically, we show that using Gaussian processes (GP) we can predict AT at the individual patient level with reasonable accuracy given the small sample size of the available group of patients. We conclude by presenting future perspectives for improving and extending the proposed framework.\\n\\nOur modelling and analysis have the potential to pave the way to designing personalised exercise programmes that are tailored to specific individual needs relative to patients treatment therapies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundConverging evidence suggests that immune-mediated dysfunction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Although genetic studies have shown that immune-associated loci are associated with increased FTD risk, a systematic investigation of genetic overlap between immune-mediated diseases and the spectrum of FTD-related disorders has not been performed.\\n\\nMethods and findingsUsing large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) (total n = 192,886 cases and controls) and recently developed tools to quantify genetic overlap/pleiotropy, we systematically identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) jointly associated with  FTD-related disorders namely FTD, corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) - and one or more immune-mediated diseases including Crohns disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), celiac disease (CeD), and psoriasis (PSOR). We found up to 270-fold genetic enrichment between FTD and RA and comparable enrichment between FTD and UC, T1D, and CeD. In contrast, we found only modest genetic enrichment between any of the immune-mediated diseases and CBD, PSP or ALS. At a conjunction false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05, we identified numerous FTD-immune pleiotropic SNPs within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region on chromosome 6. By leveraging the immune diseases, we also found novel FTD susceptibility loci within LRRK2 (Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2), TBKBP1 (TANK-binding kinase 1 Binding Protein 1), and PGBD5 (PiggyBac Transposable Element Derived 5). Functionally, we found that expression of FTD-immune pleiotropic genes (particularly within the HLA region) is altered in postmortem brain tissue from patients with frontotemporal dementia and is enriched in microglia compared to other central nervous system (CNS) cell types.\\n\\nConclusionsWe show considerable immune-mediated genetic enrichment specifically in FTD, particularly within the HLA region. Our genetic results suggest that for a subset of patients, immune dysfunction may contribute to risk for FTD. These findings have potential implications for clinical trials targeting immune dysfunction in patients with FTD.",

Moreover, the significantly associated region on chromosome 4 colocalises with a Manihot glaziovii introgression segment and the significant SNP markers on chromosome 11 are situated within a cluster of nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes previously described in cassava. Overall, predictive accuracy values found in this study varied between CBSD severity traits and across GS models with Random Forest and RKHS showing the highest predictive accuracies for foliar and root CBSD severity scores.",

    "abstract": "Microbial pathogens commonly escape the human immune system by varying surface proteins. We investigated the mechanisms used for that purpose by Pneumocystis jirovecii. This uncultivable fungus is an obligate pulmonary pathogen which causes pneumonia in immuno-compromised individuals, a major life-threatening infection. Long-read PacBio sequencing was used to assemble a core of subtelomeres of a single P. jirovecii strain from a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimen of a single patient. A total of 113 genes encoding surface proteins were identified, including 28 pseudogenes. These genes formed a subtelomeric gene superfamily which included five families encoding adhesive GPI-anchored glycoproteins, and one family encoding excreted glycoproteins. Numerical analyses suggested that diversification of the glycoproteins relies on mosaic genes created by ectopic recombination, and occurs only within each family. DNA motifs suggested that all genes are expressed independently, except those of the family encoding the most abundant surface glycoproteins which are subject to mutually exclusive expression. PCR analyses showed that exchange of the expressed gene of the latter family occurs frequently, possibly favoured by the location of the genes proximal to the telomere because this allows concomitant telomere exchange. Our observations suggest that (i) P. jirovecii cell surface is made of a complex mixture of different surface proteins, with a majority of a single isoform of the most abundant glycoprotein, (ii) genetic mosaicism within each family ensures variation of the glycoproteins, and (iii) the strategy of the fungus consists in the continuous production of new subpopulations composed of cells which are antigenically different.",

    "abstract": "In behavioral analysis, optical electrical silencing provides a way to test neuronal necessity. Two light-gated anion channels, GtACR1 and GtACR2, have recently been shown--in neuronal culture and in Drosophila--to inhibit neurons potently. Here, we test the usefulness of these channels in zebrafish. When the GtACRs were expressed in motor neurons and actuated with blue or green light, fish spontaneous movement was inhibited. In GtACR1-expressing fish, only 3 {micro}W/mm2 of light was sufficient to have an effect; GtACR2, which is poorly trafficked, required stronger illumination. After light offset, GtACR-expressing fish movement increased; this suggested that termination of light-induced neural inhibition may lead to depolarization. Consistent with this, two-photon imaging of spinal neurons showed that intracellular calcium also increased following light offset. The activity elicited at light offset needs to be taken into consideration in experimental design, although this property may help provide insight into the effects of stimulating a circuit transiently. These results show that GtACR1 and GtACR2 can be used to optically inhibit neurons in zebrafish, and thus to test neural circuit necessity.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial proteins with MCE domains were first described as being important for Mammalian Cell Entry. More recent evidence suggests they are components of lipid ABC transporters. In Escherichia coli, the single-domain protein MlaD is known to be part of an inner membrane transporter that is important for maintenance of outer membrane lipid asymmetry. Here we describe two multi MCE domain-containing proteins in Escherichia coli, PqiB and YebT, the latter of which is an orthologue of MAM-7 that was previously reported to be an outer membrane protein. We show that all three MCE domain-containing proteins localise to the inner membrane. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that MCE domains are widely distributed across bacterial phyla but multi MCE domain-containing proteins evolved in Proteobacteria from single-domain proteins. Mutants defective in mlaD, pqiAB and yebST were shown to have distinct but partially overlapping phenotypes, but the primary functions of PqiB and YebT differ from MlaD. Complementing our previous findings that all three proteins bind phospholipids, results presented here indicate that multi-domain proteins evolved in Proteobacteria for specific functions in maintaining cell envelope homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "C3G (RapGEF1), essential for mammalian embryonic development, is ubiquitously expressed and undergoes regulated nucleo-cytoplasmic exchange. Here we show that C3G localizes to SC35 positive nuclear speckles, and regulates splicing activity. Reversible association of C3G with speckles was seen upon inhibition of transcription and splicing. C3G shows partial colocalization with SC35, and is recruited to a chromatin and RNase sensitive fraction of speckles. Its presence in speckles is dependent on intact cellular actin cytoskeleton, and is lost upon expression of the kinase, Clk1. Rap1, a substrate of C3G, is also present in nuclear speckles and inactivation of Rap signalling by expression of GFP- Rap1GAP, alters speckle morphology and number. Enhanced association of C3G with speckles is seen upon GSK3{beta} inhibition, or differentiation of C2C12 cells to myotubes. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated knockdown of C3G resulted in decreased splicing activity and reduced staining for SC35 in speckles. C3G knockout clones of C2C12 as well as MDA-MB- 231 showed reduced protein levels of several splicing factors compared to control cells. Our results identify C3G and Rap1 as novel components of nuclear speckles and a role for C3G in regulating cellular RNA splicing activity.\\n\\nSummaryNuclear speckles are sites for pre-mRNA splicing. We provide evidence for localization and function of a Ras family GTPase, Rap1 and its exchange factor C3G in nuclear speckles.",

    "abstract": "Short tandem repeat (STR) expansions have been identified as the causal DNA mutation in dozens of Mendelian diseases. Historically, pathogenic STR expansions could only be detected by single locus techniques, such as PCR and electrophoresis. The ability to use short read sequencing data to screen for STR expansions has the potential to reduce both the time and cost to reaching diagnosis and enable the discovery of new causal STR loci. Most existing tools detect STR variation within the read length, and so are unable to detect the majority of pathogenic expansions. Those tools that can detect large expansions are limited to a set of known disease loci and as yet no new disease causing STR expansions have been identified with high-throughput sequencing technologies.\\n\\nHere we address this by presenting STRetch, a new genome-wide method to detect STR expansions at all loci across the human genome. We demonstrate the use of STRetch for detecting pathogenic STR expansions in short-read whole genome sequencing data with a very low false discovery rate. We further demonstrate the application of STRetch to solve cases of patients with undiagnosed disease and apply STRetch to the analysis of 97 whole genomes to reveal variation at STR loci. STRetch assesses expansions at all STR loci in the genome and allows screening for novel disease-causing STRs.\\n\\nSTRetch is open source software, available from github.com/Oshlack/STRetch.",

    "abstract": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) relies heavily on the host proteins to facilitate its entry and replication. Currently, more than 4000 human proteins are recorded to be involved in the HIV-1 life cycle. Identifying appropriate anti-HIV targets from so many host proteins is crucial to anti-HIV drug development, but a challenging work. Here we combined anti-HIV activity prediction and enrichment analysis to identify novel human targets for anti-HIV therapy. We firstly developed an accurate prediction tool named Anti-HIV-Predictor (AUC>0.96) to predict the anti-HIV activity of given compounds. Using this tool, we predicted 10488 anti-HIV compounds from ChEMBLdb. Then, based on this result and relationships of targets and compounds, we inferred 73 anti-HIV targets that enriched with anti-HIV compounds. The functional annotation and network analysis revealed that they directly or indirectly interact with 20 HIV proteins through neuropeptide signaling, GPCR signaling, cell surface signaling pathway, and so on. Nearly half of these targets overlap with the NCBI HIV dataset. However, the percentage of known therapeutic targets in these targets is significantly higher than that in the NCBI HIV dataset. After a series of feature analysis, we identified 13 novel human targets with high potential as anti-HIV targets, the inhibitors of which have experimentally confirmed anti-HIV activity. It is noteworthy that the inhibitors of REN and CALCA have better anti-HIV activity than CCR5 inhibitors. Taken together, our findings provide novel human targets for the host-oriented anti-HIV drug development and should significantly advance current anti-HIV research.",

    "abstract": "Global climate change is transforming life on earth, causing widespread effects on all ecosystems. Among marine ecosystems, estuaries are considered as nursery grounds for marine and fresh water species. M. rosenbergii, a euryhaline species, migrate to the estuaries for breeding and spawning. The subsequent larval rearing takes place by experiencing variations in temperature and salinity conditions. The present study examines the effect of different temperature and salinity on the larval development and survival by observations on stored yolk utilization, cardiac performance, as well as changes in the rate of growth in body appendages and larval activity. The larvae showed 100% mortality at higher temperature (33.5 {+/-} 0.5 {degrees}C) in all the salinity conditions (12 PPT, 15 PPT, and 20 PPT). The survival rate varied between 76-96 % on exposure to lesser temperature conditions. Likewise, the post-embryonic yolk lasted for 4 days at ambient temperature (29 {degrees}C); whereas, at 33.5 {+/-} 0.5 {degrees}C, it lasted only for 2-3 days. There was an increase in total length of larvae, when exposed to higher temperature and salinity, independently or in combination, but at 33.5 {+/-} 0.5 {degrees}C under all salinity conditions the larvae died on the 5th day. For the cardiac performance, larval heart beat (fH) significantly increased for higher temperature and salinity conditions (20 PPT; 33.5 {degrees}C) and lowered at ambient condition 12 PPT; 29{degrees}C. Larval stroke volume Vs, and Cardiac output Q{square} were higher in ambient conditions and lowest in higher temperature and salinity conditions. However, temperature and salinity together did not show any significant effect on cardiac performance. On the other hand, the larval activity decreased significantly at higher temperature and salinity conditions, compared to ambient conditions but the interactive effect did not show any change. Thus, the physiological responses to temperature and salinity by the early life stages of M. rosenbergii could restrain the tolerance capability of the organism, thereby interfering in the successful completion of the larval development under the altered climatic conditions.",

The study of EVEs, coined paleovirology, provides important insights into virus evolution. The Caulimoviridae is the most common group of EVEs in plants, although their presence has often been overlooked in plant genome studies. We have refined methods for the identification of caulimovirid EVEs and interrogated the genomes of a broad diversity of plant taxa, from algae to advanced flowering plants. Evidence is provided that almost every vascular plant (tracheophyte), including the most primitive taxa (clubmosses, ferns and gymnosperms) contains caulimovirid EVEs, many of which represent previously unrecognized evolutionary branches. In angiosperms, EVEs from at least one and as many as five different caulimovirid genera were frequently detected, and florendoviruses were the most widely distributed, followed by petuviruses. From the analysis of the distribution of different caulimovirid genera within different plant species, we propose a working evolutionary scenario in which this family of viruses emerged at latest during Devonian era (approx. 320 million years ago) followed by vertical transmission and by several cross-division host swaps.",

    "abstract": "Linear mixed effects models are frequently used for estimating quantitative genetic parameters, including the heritability, of traits of interest. Heritability is an important metric, because it acts as a filter that determines how efficiently phenotypic selection translates into evolutionary change. As a quantity of biological interest, it is important that the denominator, the phenotypic variance, actually reflects the amount of phenotypic variance in the relevant ecological stetting. The current practice of quantifying heritability from mixed effects models frequently deprives the heritability of variance explained by fixed effects (often leading to upward-bias) and it has been suggested to omit fixed effects when estimating heritabilities. We advocate an alternative option of fitting complex models incorporating all relevant effects, while including the variance explained by fixed effects into the estimation of heritabilities. The approach is easily implemented (an example is provided) and allows corrections for the estimation of heritability, such as the exclusion of variance arising from experimental design effects while still including all biologically relevant sources of variation. We explore the complications arising depending on the nature of the covariates included as fixed effects (e.g. biological or experimental origin, characteristics of biological covariates). Furthermore, we discuss fixed effects in non-linear and generalized linear models when fixed effects. In these cases, the variance parameters depend on the location of the intercept and hence on the scaling of the fixed effects. Integration over the biologically relevant range of fixed effects offers a preferred solution in those situations.",

However, the heterogeneity of biological samples used in previous studies has prevented a precise understanding of the dynamic chromatin landscape in specific cell types. Here, we show that analysis of the transposase-accessible-chromatin in single nuclei isolated from frozen tissue samples can resolve cellular heterogeneity and delineate transcriptional regulatory sequences in the constituent cell types. Our strategy is based on a combinatorial barcoding assisted single cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin5 and is optimized for nuclei from flash-frozen primary tissue samples (snATAC-seq). We used this method to examine the mouse forebrain at seven development stages and in adults. From snATAC-seq profiles of more than 15,000 high quality nuclei, we identify 20 distinct cell populations corresponding to major neuronal and non-neuronal cell-types in foetal and adult forebrains. We further define cell-type specific cis regulatory sequences and infer potential master transcriptional regulators of each cell population. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a general approach for identifying cell-type-specific cis regulatory sequences in heterogeneous tissue samples, and provide a rich resource for understanding forebrain development in mammals.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe quantification of complex morphological patterns typically involves comprehensive shape and size analyses, usually obtained by gathering morphological data from all the structures that capture the phenotypic diversity of an organism or object. Articulated structures are a critical component of overall phenotypic diversity, but data gathered from these structures are difficult to incorporate in to modern analyses because of the complexities associated with jointly quantifying 3D shape in multiple structures.\\nC_LIO_LIWhile there are existing methods for analysing shape variation in articulated structures in Two-Dimensional (2D) space, these methods do not work in 3D, a rapidly growing area of capability and research.\\nC_LIO_LIHere we describe a simple geometric rigid rotation approach that removes the effect of random translation and rotation, enabling the morphological analysis of 3D articulated structures. Our method is based on Cartesian coordinates in 3D space so it can be applied to any morphometric problem that also uses 3D coordinates (e.g. spherical harmonics). We demonstrate the method by applying it to a landmark-based data set for analysing shape variation using geometric morphometrics.\\nC_LIO_LIWe have developed an R tool (ShapeRotator) so that the method can be easily implemented in the commonly used R package geomorph and MorphoJ software. This method will be a valuable tool for 3D morphological analyses in articulated structures by allowing an exhaustive examination of shape and size diversity.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing is one of the major regulators of both, transcriptome diversity and individual isoform abundance. Therefore regulation of alternative splicing is crucial and yet, due to the complexity of the human genome (23.000 genes, most of which can be alternatively spliced) diverse and multileveled. Identifying and understanding the scope and variety of splicing events is still an ongoing process. We established a novel pipeline to extract splicing events from specific RNA-sequencing datasets and identified numerous splicing events that did not span the entirety of the respective annotated intron but used intronic splice sites. These splicing events could be generally categorized into three groups: 5recursive (using the exonic splice donor and intronic acceptor), 3recursive (using an intronic splice donor and an exonic acceptor) and nested (using two intronic splice sites). Surprisingly, the splicing events we found occurred in introns of all lengths, but generally followed the abundance scheme of all introns, i.e. most were found in introns between 500 and 5000 bps. After confirmation of these splice events by conventional methodologies, we further analyzed the impact of intrasplicing on full intron removal. For this we established a luciferase-based reporter which showed that these intronic splicing steps can be beneficial, deleterious or neutral for full intron removal. Thus intrasplicing events can be crucial for determining the transcriptional output. This in part confirms recent findings on recursive splicing events in humans and other vertebrates and further uncovers an additional level of transcriptome regulation based on a yet undiscovered level of flexibility and regulation of splice site selection and its impact on gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The activation or repression of a genes expression is primarily controlled by changes in the proteins that occupy its regulatory elements. The most common method to identify proteins associated with genomic loci is chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). While having greatly advanced our understanding of gene expression regulation, ChIP requires specific, high quality, IP-competent antibodies against nominated proteins, which can limit its utility and scope for discovery. Thus, a method able to discover and identify proteins associated with a particular genomic locus within the native cellular context would be extremely valuable. Here, we present a novel technology combining recent advances in chemical biology, genome targeting, and quantitative mass spectrometry to develop genomic locus proteomics, a method able to identify proteins which occupy a specific genomic locus.",

    "abstract": "Relaxin has been considered as a potential therapy for patients with pulmonary fibrosis. We have previously shown, however, that a potential limitation of relaxin-based therapy for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is the loss of expression of the relaxin receptor Relaxin/Insulin Like Receptor 1 (RXFP1) expression in fibroblasts. The molecular mechanism for RXFP1 down-regulation in IPF patients remains unclear. To determine whether microRNAs play a role in RXFP1 gene expression, we employed a bioinformatics approach to identify microRNAs (miRs) that are predicted to target RXFP1. By in silico analysis, we identified a putative target site in the RXFP1 mRNA for the miR-144 family. We found that miR-144-3p was upregulated in IPF fibroblasts compared to donor lung fibroblast controls. Forced miR-144-3p mimic expression reduced RXFP1 mRNA and protein levels and increased expression of the myofibroblast marker alpha-smooth muscle actin (-SMA) in donor lung fibroblasts. IPF lung fibroblasts transfected with a miR-144-3p inhibitor increased RXFP1 expression and reduced -SMA expression. A lentiviral luciferase reporter vector carrying the WT 3UTR of RXFP1 was repressed more in lung fibroblasts whereas vector carrying a mutated miR-144-3p binding site exhibited less sensitivity to endogenous miR-144-3p expression, suggesting that RXFP1 is a direct target of miR-144-3p. Thus, miR-144-3p is highly expressed in IPF fibroblasts and acts as a negative regulator of RXFP1 protein expression.",

    "abstract": "Actinobacteria are prolific producers of secondary metabolites and industrially relevant enzymes. Growth of these mycelial microorganisms in small culture volumes is challenging due to their complex morphology. Since morphology and production are typically linked, scaling down culture volumes requires better control over morphogenesis. In larger scale platforms, ranging from shake flasks to bioreactors, the hydrodynamics play an important role in shaping the morphology and determining product formation. Here, we report on the effects of agitation on the mycelial morphology of Streptomyces lividans grown in microtitre plates (MTP). Our work shows that at the proper agitation rates cultures can be scaled down to volumes as small as 100 l while maintaining the same morphology as seen in larger scale platforms. Using image analysis we compared the morphologies of the cultures; when agitated at 1400 rpm the mycelial morphology in microcultures approached that obtained in shake flasks, while product formation was also maintained. Our study shows that the morphology of actinobacteria in microcultures can be controlled in a similar manner as in larger scale cultures by carefully controlling the mixing rate. This could facilitate high-throughput screening and upscaling.",

Their mycelial lifestyle typically results in high heterogeneity in bioreactors, with morphologies ranging from fragments and open mycelial mats to dense pellets. There is a strong correlation between morphology and production in submerged cultures, with small and open mycelia favoring enzyme production, while most antibiotics are produced mainly in pellets. Here we describe SParticle, a Streptomyces Particle analysis method that combines whole slide imaging with automated image analysis to characterize the morphology of submerged grown Streptomyces cultures. SParticle allows the analysis of over a thousand particles per hour, offering a high throughput method for the imaging and statistical analysis of mycelial morphologies. The software is available as a plugin for the open source software ImageJ and allows users to create custom filters for other microbes. Therefore, SParticle is a widely applicable tool for the analysis of filamentous microorganisms in submerged cultures.",

    "abstract": "Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimers disease (AD) require differential management despite presenting with symptomatic overlap. A human electrophysiological difference is a decrease of dominant frequency (DF) -the highest power frequency between 4-15Hz- in DLB; a characteristic of Parkinsonian diseases. We analysed electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings from old adults: healthy controls (HCs), AD, DLB and Parkinsons disease dementia (PDD) patients. Brain networks were assessed with the minimum spanning tree (MST) within six EEG bands: delta, theta, high-theta, alpha, beta and DF. Patients showed lower alpha band connectivity and lower DF than HCs. Lewy body dementias showed a randomised MST compared with HCs and AD in high-theta and alpha but not within the DF. The MST randomisation in DLB and PDD reflects decreased brain efficiency as well as impaired neural synchronisation. However, the lack of network topology differences at the DF indicates a compensatory response of the brain to the neuropathology.",
