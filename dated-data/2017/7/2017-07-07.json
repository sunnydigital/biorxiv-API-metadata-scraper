    "abstract": "Variational Bayes (VB), variational maximum likelihood (VML), restricted maximum likelihood (ReML), and maximum likelihood (ML) are cornerstone parametric statistical estimation techniques in the analysis of functional neuroimaging data. However, the theoretical underpinnings of these model parameter estimation techniques are rarely covered in introductory statistical texts. Because of the widespread practical use of VB, VML, ReML, and ML in the neuroimaging community, we reasoned that. a theoretical treatment of their relationships and their application in a basic modelling scenario may be helpful for both neuroimaging novices and practitioners alike. In this technical study, we thus revisit the conceptual and formal underpinnings of VB, VML, ReML, and ML and provide a detailed account of their mathematical relationships and implementational details. We further apply VB, VML, ReML, and ML to the general linear model (GLM) with non-spherical error covariance as commonly encountered in the first-level analysis of fMRI data. To this end, we explicitly derive the corresponding free energy objective functions and ensuing iterative algorithms. Finally, in the applied part of our study, we evaluate the parameter and model recovery properties of VB, VML, ReML, and ML, first in an exemplary setting and then in the analysis of experimental fMRI data acquired from a single participant under visual stimulation.",

    "abstract": "The joint activity of neural populations is high dimensional and complex. One strategy for reaching a tractable understanding of circuit function is to seek the simplest dynamical system that can account for the population activity. By imaging Aplysias pedal ganglion during fictive locomotion, here we show that its population-wide activity arises from a low-dimensional spiral attractor. Evoking locomotion moved the population into a low-dimensional, periodic, decaying orbit -a spiral -in which it behaved as a true attractor, converging to the same orbit when evoked, and returning to that orbit after transient perturbation. We found the same attractor in every preparation, and could predict motor output directly from its orbit, yet individual neurons participation changed across consecutive locomotion bouts. From these results, we propose that only the low-dimensional dynamics for movement control, and not the high-dimensional population activity, are consistent within and between nervous systems.",

    "abstract": "The variability in transcription factor concentration among cells is an important developmental determinant, yet how variability is controlled remains poorly understood. Studies of variability have focused predominantly on monitoring mRNA production noise. Little information exists about transcription factor protein variability, since this requires the use of quantitative methods with single-molecule sensitivity. Using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), we characterized the concentration and variability of 14 endogenously tagged TFs in live Drosophila imaginal discs. For the Hox TF Antennapedia we investigated whether protein variability results from random stochastic events or is developmentally regulated. We found that Antennapedia transitioned from low concentration/high variability early, to high concentration/low variability later, in development. FCS and temporally resolved genetic studies uncovered that Antennapedia itself is necessary and sufficient to drive a developmental regulatory switch from auto-activation to auto-repression, thereby reducing variability. This switch is controlled by progressive changes in relative concentrations of preferentially activating and repressing Antennapedia isoforms, which bind chromatin with different affinities. Mathematical modelling demonstrated that the experimentally supported auto-regulatory circuit can explain the increase of Antennapedia concentration and suppression of variability over time.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDTargeted therapies specifically act by blocking the activity of proteins that are encoded by genes critical for tumorigenesis. However, most cancers acquire resistance and long-term disease remission is rarely observed. Understanding the time course of molecular changes responsible for the development of acquired resistance could enable optimization of patients treatment options. Clinically, acquired therapeutic resistance can only be studied at a single time point in resistant tumors. To determine the dynamics of these molecular changes, we obtained high throughput omics data weekly during the development of cetuximab resistance in a head and neck cancer in vitro model.\\n\\nRESULTSAn unsupervised algorithm, CoGAPS, was used to quantify the evolving transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Applying a PatternMarker statistic to the results from CoGAPS enabled novel heatmap-based visualization of the dynamics in these time course omics data. We demonstrate that transcriptional changes result from immediate therapeutic response or resistance, whereas epigenetic alterations only occur with resistance. Integrated analysis demonstrates delayed onset of changes in DNA methylation relative to transcription, suggesting that resistance is stabilized epigenetically.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSGenes with epigenetic alterations associated with resistance that have concordant expression changes are hypothesized to stabilize resistance. These genes include FGFR1, which was associated with EGFR inhibitor resistance previously. Thus, integrated omics analysis distinguishes the timing of molecular drivers of resistance. Our findings provide a relevant towards better understanding of the time course progression of changes resulting in acquired resistance to targeted therapies. This is an important contribution to the development of alternative treatment strategies that would introduce new drugs before the resistant phenotype develops.",

    "abstract": "Truncating CHD8 mutations are amongst the highest confidence risk factors for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) identified to date. To investigate how reduced Chd8 gene dosage may disrupt brain development and predispose individuals to ASD, we generated a Chd8 heterozygous mouse model. In line with clinical observations, we found that Chd8 heterozygous mice displayed subtle brain hyperplasia and hypertelorism, coupled with increased postnatal brain weight. Chd8 heterozygous mice displayed anomalous behaviours, but autism-like social deficits, repetitive and restricted behaviours were not present. Only minor gene expression changes were observed in the embryonic neocortex at E12.5, with more pronounced gene expression changes in postnatal cortex at P5. Differentially expressed genes showed highly significant enrichment for known autism candidates. Amongst the down-regulated transcripts, genes involved in cell adhesion and axon guidance were particularly prominent, implicating impaired connectivity as a potential mechanism underlying the ASD phenotype. To probe this further, we performed resting state functional fMRI and found increased synchronised activity in cortico-hippocampal and auditory-parietal networks, hinting at impaired sensory processing. Together, these data show that Chd8 heterozygous mice recapitulate key clinical features found in patients with CHD8 mutations and show a unique combination of behavioural phenotypes, which may be underpinned by a distinctive disruption of brain connectivity and sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks are rapidly gaining popularity in regulatory genomics. Typically, these networks have a stack of convolutional and pooling layers, followed by one or more fully connected layers. In genomics, the same positional patterns are often present across multiple convolutional channels. Therefore, in current state-of-the-art networks, there exists significant redundancy in the representations learned by standard fully connected layers. We present a new separable fully connected layer that learns a weights tensor that is the outer product of positional weights and cross-channel weights, thereby allowing the same positional patterns to be applied across multiple convolutional channels. Decomposing positional and cross-channel weights further enables us to readily impose biologically-inspired constraints on positional weights, such as symmetry. We also propose a novel regularizer and constraint that act on curvature in the positional weights. Using experiments on simulated and in vivo datasets, we show that networks that incorporate our separable fully connected layer outperform conventional models with analogous architectures and the same number of parameters. Additionally, our networks are more robust to hyperparameter tuning, have more informative gradients, and produce importance scores that are more consistent with known biology than conventional deep neural networks.\\n\\nAvailabilityImplementation: https://github.com/kundajelab/keras/tree/keras_1\\n\\nA gist illustrating model setup is at: goo.gl/gYooaa",

    "abstract": "We previously developed TRIBE, a method for the identification of cell-specific RNA binding protein targets. TRIBE expresses an RBP of interest fused to the catalytic domain (cd) of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR and performs Adenosine-to-Inosine editing on RNA targets of the RBP. However, target identification is limited by the low editing efficiency of the ADARcd. Here we describe HyperTRIBE, which carries a previously characterized hyperactive mutation (E488Q) of the ADARcd. HyperTRIBE identifies dramatically more editing sites, many of which are also edited by TRIBE but at a much lower editing frequency. HyperTRIBE therefore more faithfully recapitulates the known binding specificity of its RBP than TRIBE. In addition, separating RNA binding from the enhanced editing activity of the HyperTRIBE ADAR catalytic domain sheds light on the mechanism of ADARcd editing as well as the enhanced activity of the HyperADARcd.",

Manipulation of these transcription factors in model organisms has unraveled key aspects of evolution, like the transition from fin to limb.

Here, we report on evolutionary simplification in two species of the dwarf minnow genus Paedocypris using whole genome sequencing. The two species feature unprecedented Hox gene loss and genome reduction in association with their massive developmental truncation. We also show how other genes involved in the development of musculature, nervous system, and skeleton have been lost in Paedocypris, mirroring its highly progenetic phenotype. Further, we identify two mechanisms responsible for genome streamlining: severe intron shortening and reduced repeat content. As a naturally simplified system closely related to zebrafish, Paedocypris provides novel insights into vertebrate development.",

    "abstract": "The sensory drive theory predicts that signals, sensory systems, and signaling behavior should coevolve. Variation in the sensory systems of prey and predators may explain the diversity of color signals, such as color polymorphism. The spider Gasteracantha cancriformis (Araneidae) possesses several conspicuous color morphs. The aim of the present study was to assess whether the color polymorphism of G. cancriformis may be maintained by pressure from multiple signal receivers, such as prey and predators with distinct color vision systems. Although, the multiple receivers world is a more realistic scenario, it has received little attention. In orb-web spiders, the prey attraction hypothesis states that conspicuous colors are prey lures that increase spider foraging success via flower mimicry. However, in highly defended species, conspicuous colors could also be a warning signal to predators. We used color vision modelling to estimate chromatic and achromatic contrast of G. cancriformis morphs as perceived by potential prey and predator taxa. Our results revealed that individual prey and predator taxa perceive the conspicuousness of morphs differently. For instance, the red morph is perceived as quite conspicuous to lepidopteran prey and avian predators, but not by other insects. Therefore, the multiple prey and predator hypotheses may explain the evolution of color polymorphism in G. cancriformis. However, flower mimicry hypothesis was weakly corroborated. Other parameters that are not evaluated by color vision models, such as distance, shape, angle, and pattern geometry could also affect the perception of color morphs by both prey and predators and thereby influence morph survival.",

Here, we show that NMDAR-Ab change intrinsic cortical connections and neuronal population dynamics to alter the spectral composition of spontaneous EEG activity, and predispose to paroxysmal EEG abnormalities. Based on local field potential recordings in a mouse model, we first validate a dynamic causal model of NMDAR-Ab effects on cortical microcircuitry. Using this model, we then identify the key synaptic parameters that best explain EEG paroxysms in paediatric patients with NMDAR-Ab encephalitis. Finally, we use the mouse model to show that NMDAR-Ab- related changes render microcircuitry critically susceptible to overt EEG paroxysms, when these key parameters are changed.

    "abstract": "Pain is the predominant symptom of osteoarthritis, but the connection between joint damage and the genesis of pain is not well understood. Loss of articular cartilage is a hallmark of osteoarthritis, and it occurs through enzymatic degradation of aggrecan by ADAMTS-4/5-mediated cleavage in the interglobular domain (E373-374 A). Further cleavage by MMPs (N341-342 F) releases a 32-amino-acid aggrecan fragment (32-mer). We investigated the role of this 32-mer in driving joint pain. We demonstrated that the 32-mer excites dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptive neurons, both in culture and in intact explants. Treatment of cultured sensory neurons with the 32-mer induced them to express the pro-algesic chemokine, MCP-1/CCL2. These effects were mediated through Toll-like receptor (TLR)2, which we demonstrated was expressed by nociceptive neurons. In addition, intra-articular injection of the 32-mer provoked knee hyperalgesia in wild-type but not Tlr2 null mice. Blocking the production or action of the 32-mer in transgenic mice prevented the development of knee hyperalgesia in a murine model of osteoarthritis. These findings suggest that the aggrecan 32-mer fragment directly activates TLR2 on joint nociceptors and is an important mediator of the development of osteoarthritis-associated joint pain.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe construction of rank hierarchies based on agonistic interactions between two individuals (\\\"dyads\\\") is an important component in the characterization of the social structure of groups. To this end, winner-loser matrices are typically created, which collapse the outcome of dyadic interactions over time, resulting in the loss of all information contained in the temporal domain. Methods that track changes in the outcome of dyadic interactions (such as \\\"Elo-scores\\\") are receiving increasing interest. Critically, individual scores are not just based on the succession of wins and losses, but depend on the values of starting scores and an update (\\\"tax\\\") coefficient. Recent studies improved existing methods by introducing a point estimation of these auxiliary parameters on the basis of a maximum likelihood (ML) approach. For a sound assessment of the rank hierarchies generated this way, we argue that measures of uncertainty of the estimates, as well as a quantification of the robustness of the methods, are also needed.\\nC_LIO_LIWe introduce a Bayesian inference (BI) approach using   partial pooling\\\", which rests on the assumption that all starting scores are samples from the same distribution. We compare the outcome of the ML approach to that of the BI approach using real-world data. In addition, we simulate different scenarios to explore in which way the Elo-score responds to social events (such as rank changes), and low numbers of observations.\\nC_LIO_LIEstimates of the starting scores based on  partial pooling\\\" are more robust than those based on ML, also in scenarios where some individuals have only few observations. Our simulations show that assumed rank differences may fall well within the  uncertain\\\" range, and that low sampling density, unbalanced designs, and coalitionary leaps involving several individuals within the hierarchy may yield unreliable results.\\nC_LIO_LIOur results support the view that Elo rating can be a powerful tool in the analysis of social behaviour, when the data meet certain criteria. Assessing the uncertainty greatly aids in the interpretation of results. We advocate running simulation approaches to test how well Elo scores reflect the (simulated) true structure and how sensitive the score is to true changes in the hierarchy.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Antibiotics plays a pivotal role in modern medicine for the treatment of bacterial infection in patients. Membrane defines the boundary between single cell and its environment and is a main target for antibacterial agents. To better understand the mechanism of antibiotics action on microbes, we utilized liposome as membrane mimic model to study antibiotics interaction with bacterial membrane by variety of biophysical methods. Isothermal calorimetry and fluorescence photometry experiments were performed to examine interaction between antibiotics and liposome. We found that vancomycin, one of the most important antibiotics for the treatment of serious infections by gram-positive bacteria, binds to the liposome. The association between the drug and the liposome does not involve the tail part of the lipids. Moreover, the binding affinity increases along with the increment of liposome size. Of three major lipid components, phosphatidylglycerol is the preferential target for vancomycin binding. We also showed that vancomycin associates with vesicle derived from Staphylococcus aureus membrane in a similar manner as the binding to liposome. Our data suggested that vancomycin associates with bacterial membrane through direct interaction with lipid head groups with the extent of the association depending very much on specific type of lipids and curvature of local membrane structure.",

    "abstract": "The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) in healthcare has provided vast new amounts of data for statistical machine learning researchers in their efforts to model and predict patient health status, potentially enabling novel advances in treatment. In the case of sepsis, a debilitating, dysregulated host response to infection, extracting subtle, uncataloged clinical phenotypes from the EMR with statistical machine learning methods has the potential to impact patient diagnosis and treatment early in the course of their hospitalization. However, there are significant barriers that must be overcome to extract these insights from EMR data. First, EMR datasets consist of both static and dynamic observations of discrete and continuous-valued variables, many of which may be missing, precluding the application of standard multivariate analysis techniques. Second, clinical populations observed via EMRs and relevant to the study and management of conditions like sepsis are often heterogeneous; properly accounting for this heterogeneity is critical. Here, we describe an unsupervised, probabilistic framework called a composite mixture model that can simultaneously accommodate the wide variety of observations frequently observed in EMR datasets, characterize heterogeneous clinical populations, and handle missing observations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a large-scale sepsis cohort, developing novel techniques built on our model-based clusters to track patient mortality risk over time and identify physiological trends and distinct subgroups of the dataset associated with elevated risk of mortality during hospitalization.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Illumina sequencing platforms have enabled widespread bacterial whole genome sequencing. While Illumina data is appropriate for many analyses, its short read length limits its ability to resolve genomic structure. This has major implications for tracking the spread of mobile genetic elements, including those which carry antimicrobial resistance determinants. Fully resolving a bacterial genome requires long-read sequencing such as those generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms. Here we describe our use of the ONT MinION to sequence 12 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae on a single flow cell. We assembled each genome using a combination of ONT reads and previously available Illumina reads, and little to no manual intervention was needed to achieve fully resolved assemblies using the Unicycler hybrid assembler. Assembling only ONT reads with Canu was less effective, resulting in fewer resolved genomes and higher error rates even following error correction with Nanopolish. We demonstrate that multiplexed ONT sequencing is a valuable tool for high-throughput bacterial genome finishing. Specifically, we advocate the use of Illumina sequencing as a first analysis step, followed by ONT reads as needed to resolve genomic structure.\\n\\nData summaryO_LISequence read files for all 12 isolates have been deposited in SRA, accessible through these NCBI BioSample accession numbers: SAMEA3357010, SAMEA3357043, SAMN07211279, SAMN07211280, SAMEA3357223, SAMEA3357193, SAMEA3357346, SAMEA3357374, SAMEA3357320, SAMN07211281, SAMN07211282, SAMEA3357405.\\nC_LIO_LIA full list of SRA run accession numbers (both Illumina reads and ONT reads) for these samples are available in Table S1.\\nC_LIO_LIAssemblies and sequencing reads corresponding to each stage of processing and analysis are provided in the following figshare project: https://figshare.com/projects/Completing_bacterial_genome_assemblies_with_multiplex_MinION_sequencing/23068\\nC_LIO_LISource code is provided in the following public GitHub repositories: https://github.com/rrwick/Bacterial-genome-assemblies-with-multiplex-MinION-sequencing https://github.com/rrwick/Porechop https://github.com/rrwick/Fast5-to-Fastq\\nC_LI\\n\\nImpact StatementLike many research and public health laboratories, we frequently perform large-scale bacterial comparative genomics studies using Illumina sequencing, which assays gene content and provides the high-confidence variant calls needed for phylogenomics and transmission studies. However, problems often arise with resolving genome assemblies, particularly around regions that matter most to our research, such as mobile genetic elements encoding antibiotic resistance or virulence genes. These complexities can often be resolved by long sequence reads generated with PacBio or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms. While effective, this has proven difficult to scale, due to the relatively high costs of generating long reads and the manual intervention required for assembly. Here we demonstrate the use of barcoded ONT libraries sequenced in multiplex on a single ONT MinION flow cell, coupled with hybrid assembly using Unicycler, to resolve 12 large bacterial genomes. Minor manual intervention was required to fully resolve small plasmids in five isolates, which we found to be underrepresented in ONT data. Cost per sample for the ONT sequencing was equivalent to Illumina sequencing, and there is potential for significant savings by multiplexing more samples on the ONT run. This approach paves the way for high-throughput and cost-effective generation of completely resolved bacterial genomes to become widely accessible.",

    "abstract": "Early adversity and socioeconomic disadvantage are risk factors associated with diminished cognitive outcomes during development. Recent studies also provide evidence that upbringings characterized by stressful experiences and markers of disadvantage during childhood, such as lower parental education or household income, are associated with variation in brain structure. Although disadvantage often confers adversity, these are distinct risk factors whose differential influences on neurodevelopment and neurocognitive outcomes are not well characterized. We examined pathways linking parental education, adverse experiences, brain structure, and cognitive performances through an analysis of 1,413 typically-developing youth, ages 8 through 21, in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Parental education and adverse experiences had unique associations with cortical surface area and subcortical volume as well as cognitive performance across several domains. Associations between parental education and several cognitive tasks were explained, in part, by variation in cortical surface area. In contrast, associations between adversity and cognitive tasks were explained primarily by variation in subcortical volume. A composite neurodevelopmental factor derived from principal component analysis of cortical thickness, cortical surface area, and subcortical volume mediated independent associations between both parental education and adverse experiences with reading, geometric reasoning, verbal reasoning, attention, and emotional differentiation tasks. Our analysis provides novel evidence that socioeconomic disadvantage and adversity influence neurodevelopmental pathways associated with cognitive outcomes through independent mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiomes of birds and other animals are increasingly being studied in ecological and evolutionary contexts. While methods for preserving samples and processing high-throughput sequence data to characterise bacterial communities have received considerable attention, there has been little evaluation of non-invasive sampling methods. Numerous studies on birds and reptiles have made inferences about gut microbiota using cloacal sampling, however, it is not known whether the bacterial community of the cloaca provides an accurate representation of the avian gut microbiome. We examined the accuracy with which cloacal swabs and faecal samples measure the microbiota in three different parts of the gastrointestinal tract (ileum, caecum, and colon) using a case study on juvenile ostriches, Struthio camelus, and high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing. We found that faeces were significantly better than cloacal swabs in representing the bacterial community of the colon. Cloacal samples had a higher abundance of Gammaproteobacteria and fewer Clostridia relative to the gut and faecal samples. However, both faecal and cloacal samples were poor representatives of the microbial communities in the caecum and ileum. Furthermore, the accuracy of the sampling methods in measuring the abundance of different bacterial taxa was highly variable: Bacteroidetes was the most highly correlated phylum between all three gut sections and both methods, whereas colonic Actinobacteria correlated strongly only with faecal samples. This study demonstrates that sampling methods can have significant effects on the inferred gut microbiome in studies of birds. Based on our results, we recommend sampling faeces, whenever possible, as this provides the most accurate assessment of the colon microbiome. The fact that neither sampling technique portrayed the bacterial community of the ileum or the caecum illustrates the difficulty in non-invasively monitoring gut bacteria located further up in the gastrointestinal tract. These results have important implications for the interpretation of avian gut microbiome studies.",

    "abstract": "Plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs) can influence plant competition via direct interactions with pathogens and mutualists or indirectly via apparent competition/mutualisms (i.e., spillover to cooccurring plants) and soil legacy effects. Presently, it is unknown how intraspecific variation in PSFs interacts with the environment (e.g., nutrient availability) to influence competition between native and invasive plants. We conducted a fully crossed multi-factor greenhouse experiment to determine the effects of soil biota, interspecific competition, and nutrient availability on biomass of replicate populations from one native and two invasive lineages of common reed (Phragmites australis) and a single lineage of native smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora). Harmful soil biota consistently dominated PSFs involving all three P. australis lineages, reducing biomass by 10%, regardless of nutrient availability or S. alterniflora presence as a competitor. Spillover of soil biota derived from the rhizosphere of the two invasive P. australis lineages reduced S. alterniflora biomass by 7%, whereas soil biota from the native P. australis lineage increased S. alterniflora biomass by 6%. Interestingly, regardless of lineage, P. australis soil biota negatively affected S. alterniflora biomass when grown alone (i.e., a soil legacy), but had a positive impact when grown with P. australis, suggesting that P. australis is preferred by harmful generalist soil biota or facilitates S. alterniflora via spillover (i.e., apparent mutualism). Soil biota also reduced the negative impacts of interspecific competition on S. alterniflora by 13%, although it remained competitively inferior to P. australis across all treatments. Moreover, competitive interactions and the response to nutrients did not differ among P. australis lineages, indicating that interspecific competition and nutrient deposition may not be key drivers of P. australis invasion in North America. Taken together, although soil biota, interspecific competition, and nutrient availability appear to have no direct impact on the success of invasive P. australis lineages in North America, indirect spillover and soil legacies from P. australis occur and may have important implications for co-occurring native species and restoration of invaded habitats. Our study integrates multiple factors linked to plant invasions, highlighting that indirect interactions are likely commonplace in driving successful invasions and their impacts on the local community.",

    "abstract": "Protein evolution is driven by the sum of different physiochemical and genetic processes that usually results in strong purifying selection to maintain biochemical functions. However, proteins that are part of systems under arms race dynamics often evolve at unparalleled rates that can produce atypical biochemical properties. In the marine mollusk abalone, lysin and VERL are a pair of rapidly coevolving proteins that are essential for species-specific interactions between sperm and egg. Despite extensive biochemical characterization of lysin, including crystal structures of multiple orthologs, it was unclear how sites under positive selection may facilitate recognition of VERL. Using a combination of targeted mutagenesis and multidimensional NMR, we present a high-definition solution structure of sperm lysin from red abalone (Haliotis rufescens). Unapparent from the crystallography data, multiple NMR-based analyses conducted in solution reveal clustering of the N-and C-termini to form a nexus of 13 positively selected sites that constitute a VERL binding interface. Evolutionary rate was found to be a significant predictor of backbone flexibility, which may be critical for lysin bioactivity and / or accelerated evolution. These flexible, rapidly evolving segments that constitute the VERL binding interface were also the most distorted regions of the crystal structure relative to what was observed in solution. While lysin has been the subject of extensive biochemical and evolutionary analyses for more than 30 years, this study highlights the enhanced insights gained from applying NMR approaches to rapidly evolving proteins.\\n\\nSignificanceThe fertilization of eggs by sperm is a critical biological process for nearly all sexually reproducing organisms to propagate their genetic information. Despite the importance of fertilization, the molecules that mediate egg-sperm interactions have been characterized for only a few species, and the biochemical mechanisms underlying these interactions are even less well understood. In the marine mollusk abalone, sperm lysin interacts with egg VERL in a species-specific manner to facilitate fertilization. In this report, we characterized the solution structure and molecular evolution of sperm lysin from red abalone (Haliotis rufescens), and identified the VERL binding interface as well as important lysin dimer interactions that have emerged as part of an incessant sexual arms race.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 80% of all recent sponge species belong to the class Demospongiae. Yet, despite their diversity and importance, accurate divergence times are still unknown for most demosponge clades. The estimation of demosponge divergence time is key to answering fundamental questions like e.g. the origin of Demospongiae, their diversification and historical biogeography. Molecular sequence data alone is not informative on an absolute time scale, and therefore needs to be \\\"calibrated\\\" with additional data such as fossils. Here, we apply the fossilized birth-death model (FBD), which has the advantage, compared to strict node dating with the oldest fossil occurrences, that it allows for the inclusion of young and old fossils in the analysis of divergence time. We use desma-bearing sponges, a diverse group of demosponges that form rigid skeletons and have a rich and continuous fossil record dating back to the Cambrian ([~]500 Ma), aiming to date the demosponge radiation and constrain the timing of key evolutionary events, like the transition from marine to freshwater habitats. To do so, we assembled mitochondrial genomes of six desma-bearing demosponges from size-selected reduced-representation genomic libraries and apply a fossilized birth-death model including 30 fossils and 33 complete demosponge mitochondrial genomes to infer a dated phylogeny of Demospongiae. Our study supports a Neoproterozoic origin of Demospongiae. Novel age estimates for the split of freshwater and marine sponges dating back to the Carboniferous and the previously assumed Recent ([~]18 Ma) diversification of freshwater sponges is supported. Moreover, we provide detailed age estimates for a possible diversification of Tetractinellidae ([~]315 Ma), the Astrophorina ([~]240 Ma), the Spirophorina ([~]120 Ma) and the family Corallistidae ([~]188 Ma) all of which are considered as key groups for dating the Demospongiae, due to their extraordinary rich and continuous fossil history.",

We apply MTAG to three large GWAS: Sniekers et al (2017) on intelligence, Okbay et al. (2016) on Educational attainment, and Hill et al. (2016) on household income.

We found 107 independent loci associated with intelligence, implicating 233 genes, using both SNP-based and gene-based GWAS.

We show that the results of our combined analysis demonstrate the same pattern of genetic correlations as a single measure/the simple measure of intelligence, providing support for the meta-analysis of these genetically-related phenotypes. We find that our MTAG meta-analysis of intelligence shows similar genetic correlations to 26 other phenotypes when compared with a GWAS consisting solely of cognitive tests.

We apply MTAG to three large GWAS: Sniekers et al (2017) on intelligence, Okbay et al. (2016) on Educational attainment, and Hill et al. (2016) on household income. By combining these three samples our functional sample size increased from 78 308 participants to 147 194. We found 107 independent loci associated with intelligence, implicating 233 genes, using both SNP-based and gene-based GWAS. We find evidence that neurogenesis may explain some of the biological differences in intelligence as well as genes expressed in the synapse and those involved in the regulation of the nervous system. We show that the results of our combined analysis demonstrate the same pattern of genetic correlations as a single measure/the simple measure of intelligence, providing support for the meta-analysis of these genetically-related phenotypes. We find that our MTAG meta-analysis of intelligence shows similar genetic correlations to 26 other phenotypes when compared with a GWAS consisting solely of cognitive tests. Finally, using an independent sample of 6 844 individuals we were able to predict 7% of intelligence using SNP data alone.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration is an essential process for all multicellular organisms, allowing them to recover effectively from internal and external injury. This process has been studied extensively in a medical context in vertebrates, with pathways often investigated mechanistically, both to derive increased understanding and as potential drug targets for therapy. Several species from other parts of the metazoan tree of life, noted for their regenerative prowess, have previously been targeted for study. This allows us to understand their regenerative mechanisms and see how they could be adapted for use in medicine. Species in clades such as Hydra, planarians and echinoderms can regenerate large portions of their body, the former two clades being able to completely regenerate from even a small portion of their somatic tissue. Less well-documented for their regenerative abilities are sponges. This is surprising, as they are both one of the earliest-branching extant metazoan phyla on Earth, and are rapidly able to respond to injury. Their sessile lifestyle, lack of an external protective layer, inability to respond to predation and filter-feeding strategy all mean that regeneration is often required. In particular the demosponge genus Halisarca has been noted for its fast cell turnover and ability to quickly adjust its cell kinetic properties to repair damage through regeneration. However, while the rate and structure of regeneration in sponges has begun to be investigated, the molecular mechanisms behind this ability are yet to be catalogued.\\n\\nHere we describe the assembly of a reference transcriptome for Halisarca caerulea, along with additional transcriptomes noting response to injury before, shortly following (2 hrs post-), and 12 hrs after trauma. RNAseq reads were assembled using Trinity, annotated, and samples compared, to allow initial insight into the transcriptomic basis of sponge regenerative processes. These resources are deep, with our reference assembly containing more than 92.6% of the BUSCO Metazoa set of genes, and well-assembled (N50s of 836, 957, 1,688 and 2,032 for untreated, 2h, 12h and reference transcriptomes respectively), and therefore represent excellent initial resources as a bedrock for future study. The generation of transcriptomic resources from sponges before and following deliberate damage has allowed us to study particular pathways within this species responsible for repairing damage. We note particularly the involvement of the Wnt cascades in this process in this species, and detail the contents of this cascade, along with cell cycle, extracellular matrix and apoptosis-linked genes in this work.\\n\\nThis resource represents an excellent starting point for the continued development of this knowledge, given H. caeruleas ability to regenerate and position as an outgroup for comparing the process of regeneration across metazoan lineages. With this resource in place, we can begin to infer the regenerative capacity of the common ancestor of all extant animal life, and unravel the elements of regeneration in an often-overlooked clade.",

Since their first detection due to technological advances in the late 1990s, ROHs have been shedding light on human population history and deciphering the genetic basis of monogenic and complex traits and diseases. ROH studies have predominantly exploited SNP array data, but are gradually moving to whole genome sequence (WGS) data as it becomes available. WGS data, covering more genetic variability, can add value to ROH studies, but require additional considerations during analysis. Using SNP array and low coverage WGS data from 1885 individuals from 20 world populations, our aims were to compare ROH from the two datasets and to establish software conditions to get comparable results, thus providing guidelines for combining disparate datasets in joint ROH analyses. Using the PLINK Homozygosity functions, we found that by allowing 3 heterozygous SNPs per window when dealing with WGS low coverage data, it is possible to establish meaningful comparisons between data using the two technologies.",

    "abstract": "As technology advances, whole genome sequencing (WGS) is likely to supersede other genotyping technologies. The rate of this change depends on its relative cost and utility. Variants identified uniquely through WGS may reveal novel biological pathways underlying complex disorders and provide high-resolution insight into when, where, and in which cell type these pathways are affected. Alternatively, cheaper and less computationally intensive approaches may yield equivalent insights. Understanding the role of rare variants in the noncoding gene-regulating genome, through pilot WGS projects, will be critical to determine which of these two extremes best represents reality. With large cohorts, well-defined risk loci, and a compelling need to understand the underlying biology, psychiatric disorders have a role to play in this preliminary WGS assessment. The WGSPD consortium will integrate data for 18,000 individuals with psychiatric disorders, beginning with autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder, along with over 150,000 controls.",

Manual staging is resource-intensive and time-consuming and considerable efforts have to be spent to ensure inter-rater reliability. There is thus great interest in techniques based on signal processing and machine learning for a completely Automatic Sleep Stage Classification (ASSC).\\n\\nMethodsIn this paper, we present a single EEG-sensor ASSC technique based on dynamic reconfiguration of different aspects of cross-frequency coupling (CFC) estimated between predefined frequency pairs over 5s epoch lengths.

    "abstract": "While graph theoretical modeling has dramatically advanced our understanding of complex brain systems, the feasibility of aggregating brain graphic data in large imaging consortia remains unclear. Here, using a battery of cognitive, emotional and resting fMRI paradigms, we investigated the reproducibility of functional connectomic measures across multiple sites and sessions. Our results revealed overall fair to excellent reliability for a majority of measures during both rest and tasks, in particular for those quantifying connectivity strength, network segregation and network integration. Higher reliabilities were detected for cognitive tasks (vs rest) and for weighted networks (vs binary networks). While network diagnostics for several primary functional systems were consistently reliable independently of paradigm, those for cognitive-emotional systems were reliable predominantly when challenged by task. Different data aggregation approaches yielded significantly different reliability. In addition, we showed that after accounting for observed reliability, satisfactory statistical power can be achieved in the multisite context with a total sample size of approximately 250 when the effect size is at least moderate. Our findings provide direct evidence for the generalizability of brain graphs for both resting and task paradigms in large consortia and encourage the use of multisite, multisession scans to enhance power for human functional connectomic studies.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety is one of the most common mental states of humans. Although it drives us to avoid frightening situations and to achieve our goals, it may also impose significant suffering and burden if it becomes extreme. Because we experience anxiety in a variety of forms, previous studies investigated neural substrates of anxiety in a variety of ways. These studies revealed that individuals with high state, trait, or pathological anxiety showed altered neural substrates. However, no studies have directly investigated whether the different dimensions of anxiety share a common neural substrate, despite its theoretical and practical importance. Here, we investigated a neural network of anxiety shared by different dimensions of anxiety in a unified analytical framework using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We analyzed different datasets in a single scale, which was defined by an anxiety-related neural network derived from whole brain. Through the fMRI task for provoking anxiety, we found a common neural network of state anxiety across participants (1,638 trials obtained from 10 participants). Then, using the resting-state fMRI in combination with the participants trait anxiety scale (879 participants from the Human Connectome Project), we demonstrated that trait anxiety also shared the same neural network as state anxiety. Furthermore, the common neural network between state and trait anxiety could detect patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, which is characterized by pathological anxiety-driven behaviors (174 participants from multi-site datasets). Our findings provide direct evidence that different dimensions of anxiety are not completely independent but have a substantial biological inter-relationship. Our results also provide a biologically defined dimension of anxiety, which may promote further investigation of various human characteristics, including psychiatric disorders, from the perspective of anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Pathophysiological explanations of epilepsy typically focus on either the micro/mesoscale (e.g. excitation-inhibition imbalance), or on the macroscale (e.g. network architecture). Linking abnormalities across spatial scales remains difficult, partly because of technical limitations in measuring neuronal signatures concurrently at the scales involved. Here we use light sheet imaging of the larval zebrafish brain during acute epileptic seizure induced with pentylenetetrazole. Empirically measured spectral changes of spontaneous neuronal activity during the seizure are then modelled using neural mass models, allowing Bayesian inference on changes in effective network connectivity and their underlying synaptic dynamics. This dynamic causal modelling of seizures in the zebrafish brain reveals concurrent changes in synaptic coupling at macro- and mesoscale. Fluctuations of synaptic connection strength and their temporal dynamics are both required to explain observed seizure patterns. These findings challenge a simple excitation-inhibition account of seizures, and highlight changes in synaptic transmission dynamics as a possible seizure generation pathomechanism.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Due to the limitations of the animal model, computational prediction of serious, rare ADRs is invaluable. However, current state-of-the-art computational methods do not yield significantly better predictions of rare ADRs than random guessing. We present a novel method, based on the theory of \\\"compressed sensing\\\", which can accurately predict serious side-effects of candidate and market drugs. Not only is our method able to infer new chemical-ADR associations using existing noisy, biased, and incomplete databases, but our data also demonstrates that the accuracy of our approach in predicting a serious adverse reaction (ADR) for a candidate drug increases with increasing knowledge of other ADRs associated with the drug. In practice, this means that as the candidate drug moves up the different stages of clinical trials, the prediction accuracy of our method will increase accordingly. Thus, the compressed sensing based computational method reported here represents a major advance in predicting severe rare ADRs, and may facilitate reducing the time and cost of drug discovery and development.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale metabolic modeling is a cornerstone of systems biology analysis of microbial organisms and communities, yet these genome-scale modeling efforts are invariably based on incomplete functional annotations. Annotated genomes typically contain 30-50% of genes without functional annotation, severely limiting our knowledge of the \\\"parts lists\\\" that the organisms have at their disposal. These incomplete annotations may be sufficient to derive a model of a core set of well-studied metabolic pathways that support growth in pure culture. However, pathways important for growth on unusual metabolites exchanged in complex microbial communities are often less understood, resulting in missing functional annotations in newly sequenced genomes. Here, we present results on a comprehensive reannotation of 27 bacterial reference genomes, focusing on enzymes with EC numbers annotated by KEGG, RAST, EFICAz, and the BRENDA enzyme database, and on membrane transport annotations by TransportDB, KEGG and RAST. Our analysis shows that annotation using multiple tools can result in a drastically larger metabolic network reconstruction, adding on average 40% more EC numbers, 3-8 times more substrate-specific transporters, and 37% more metabolic genes. These results are even more pronounced for bacterial species that are more phylogenetically distant from well-studied model organisms such as E. coli.",

    "abstract": "DArcy Thompson emphasised the importance of surface tension as a potential driving force in establishing cell shape and topology within tissues. Leaf epidermal pavement cells grow into jigsaw-piece shapes, highly deviating from such classical forms. We investigate the topology of developing Arabidopsis leaves composed solely of pavement cells. Image analysis of around 50,000 cells reveals a clear and unique topological signature, deviating from previously studied epidermal tissues. This topological distribution is however established early during leaf development, already before the typical pavement cell shapes emerge, with topological homestasis maintained throughout growth and unaltered between division and maturation zones. Simulating graph models, we identify a heuristic cellular division rule that reproduces the observed topology. Our parsimonious model predicts how and when cells effectively place their division plane with respect to their neighbours. We verify the predicted dynamics through in vivo tracking of 800 mitotic events, and conclude that the distinct topology is not a direct consequence of the jigsaw-like shape of the cells, but rather owes itself to a strongly life-history-driven process, with limited impact from cell surface mechanics.\\n\\nSummary statement\\n\\nDevelopment of the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis topology is driven by deceptively simple rules of cell division, independent of surface tension, cell size and, often complex, cell shape.",

    "abstract": "RNA is secreted from cells enclosed within extracellular vesicles (EVs). Defining the RNA composition of EVs is challenging due to their co-isolation with contaminants, a lack of knowledge of the mechanisms of RNA sorting into EVs and limitations of conventional RNA-seq methods. Here we present our observations using thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase sequencing (TGIRT-seq) to characterize the RNA extracted from HEK293T cell EVs isolated by flotation gradient ultracentrifugation and from exosomes containing the tetraspannin CD63 further purified from the gradient fractions by immunoisolation. We found that EV-associated transcripts are dominated by full-length, mature tRNAs and other small non-coding RNAs encapsulated within vesicles. A substantial proportion of the reads mapping to protein-coding genes, long non-coding, and antisense RNAs were due to DNA contamination on the surface of vesicles. Nevertheless, sequences mapping to spliced mRNAs were identified within HEK293T cell EVs and exosomes, among the most abundant being transcripts containing a 5 terminal oligopyrimidine (5 TOP) motif. Our results indicate that the RNA-binding protein YBX1, which we showed previously is required for the sorting of selected miRNAs into exosomes, plays a role in the sorting of highly abundant small non-coding RNA species, including tRNAs, Y RNAs, and Vault RNAs. Finally, we obtained evidence for an EV-specific tRNA modification, perhaps indicating a role for post-transcriptional modification in the sorting of some RNA species into EVs. The identification of full-length small non-coding RNAs within EVs suggests a role for EVs in the export and possible intercellular functional transfer of abundant cellular transcripts.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceCells release vesicles containing selectively packaged cargo, including RNA, into the extracellular environment. Prior studies have identified RNA inside extracellular vesicles (EVs) but, due to limitations of conventional sequencing methods, highly structured and post-transcriptionally modified RNA species were not effectively captured. Using an alternative sequencing approach (TGIRT-seq), we found that EVs contain abundant small non-coding RNA species, including full-length tRNAs and Y RNAs. Using a knockout cell line, we obtained evidence that the RNA-binding protein YBX1 plays a role in sorting small non-coding RNAs into a subpopulation of extracellular vesicles termed exosomes. These experiments expand our understanding of EV-RNA composition and provide insights into how RNA is sorted into EVs for export from the cell.",

    "abstract": "We present a model for the autonomous learning of active binocular vision using a recently developed biome-chanical model of the human oculomotor system. The model is formulated in the Active Efficient Coding (AEC) framework, a recent generalization of classic efficient coding theories to active perception. The model simultaneously learns how to efficiently encode binocular images and how to generate accurate vergence eye movements that facilitate efficient encoding of the visual input. In order to resolve the redundancy problem arising from the actuation of the eyes through antagonistic muscle pairs, we consider the metabolic costs associated with eye movements. We show that the model successfully learns to trade off vergence accuracy against the associated metabolic costs, producing high fidelity vergence eye movements obeying Sherringtons law of reciprocal innervation.",
