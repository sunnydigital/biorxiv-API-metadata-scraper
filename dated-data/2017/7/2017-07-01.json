    "abstract": "The capacity for flexible sensory-action association in animals has been related to context-dependent attractor dynamics outside the sensory cortices. Here we report a line of evidence that flexibly modulated attractor dynamics during task switching are already present in the higher visual cortex in macaque monkeys. With a nonlinear decoding approach, we can extract the particular aspect of the neural population response that reflects the task-induced emergence of bistable attractor dynamics in a neural population, which could be obscured by standard unsupervised dimensionality reductions such as PCA. The dynamical modulation selectively increases the information relevant to task demands, indicating that such modulation is beneficial for perceptual decisions. A computational model that features nonlinear recurrent interaction among neurons with a task-dependent background input replicates the key properties observed in the experimental data. These results suggest that the context-dependent attractor dynamics involving the sensory cortex can underlie flexible perceptual abilities.",

    "abstract": "Paracrine signals maintain developmental states and create cell-fate patterns in vivo, and influence differentiation outcomes in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in vitro. Systematic investigation of morphogen signaling is hampered by the difficulty of disentangling endogenous signaling from experimentally applied ligands. Here, we grow hESCs in micropatterned colonies of 1-8 cells (\\\"Colonies\\\") to quantitatively investigate paracrine signaling and the response to external stimuli. We examine BMP4-mediated differentiation in Colonies and standard culture conditions and find that in Colonies, above a threshold concentration, BMP4 gives rise to only a single cell fate, contrary to its role as a morphogen in other developmental systems. Under standard culture conditions, BMP4 acts as morphogen, but this effect requires secondary signals and particular cell densities. We further find that a \\\"community effect\\\" enforces a common fate within Colonies both in the state of pluripotency and when cells are differentiated, and that this effect allows more precise response to external signals. Using live cell imaging to correlate signaling histories with cell fates, we demonstrate that interactions between neighbors result in sustained, homogenous signaling necessary for differentiation.\\n\\nSummary StatementWe quantitatively examined signaling and differentiation in hESC colonies of varying size treated with BMP4. We show that secondary signals result in morphogen and community effects that determine cell fates.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic bacterial communities can protect their hosts from infection by pathogens. Treatment of wild individuals with protective bacteria isolated from hosts can combat the spread of emerging infectious diseases, but it is unclear whether the degree of bacterially-mediated host protection is uniform across multiple isolates of globally-distributed pathogens. Here we use the lethal amphibian fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis as a model to investigate the traits predicting broad-scale in vitro inhibitory capabilities of both individual bacteria and multiple-bacterial consortia. We show that inhibition of multiple pathogen isolates is rare, with no clear phylogenetic signal at the genus level. Bacterial consortia offer stronger protection against B. dendrobatidis compared to single isolates, but critically this was only true for consortia containing multiple genera, and this pattern was not uniform across all B. dendrobatidis isolates. These novel insights have important implications for the effective design of bacterial probiotics to mitigate emerging infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Ethanol exerts its actions in the central and peripheral nervous systems through the direct interactions with several proteins, including ligand-gated ion channels such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). The binding interaction between ethanol and sodium cholate solubilized nicotinic acetylcholine receptor protein can be detected through either NMR line broadening or T1 titration. In this paper, we examine the use of weighted Navon T1p analysis of T1 titration data for the estimation of the dissociation constant of ethanol for the nAChR. We show that Navon T1p analysis underestimates binding affinity. The application of rigorous limits for confidence intervals within a nonlinear regression analysis of this data provides a best estimate of Kd = 55 M at 4 {degrees}C. within an unsymmetrical 90% confidence interval of [0.5, 440 M]. Accordingly, the best estimate of the binding free energy is {Delta}G0, = -5.4 Kcal/mole within a 90% confidence interval of [-8.0, -4.3 Kcal/mole],relative to conventional standard states.",

    "abstract": "Many terrestrial bacteria are assumed to utilize sulfate transport and metabolism as a means for fulfilling cellular sulfur requirements. As such, many defined minimal media for bacterial growth under laboratory conditions contain sulfate as their sulfur source. Herein, an exception to this assumption is described as sulfate transport capabilities have been lost at least once in a lineage of Luteibacter associated with plants and fungi. However, a representative of this lineage (an endohyphal species, Luteibacter sp. 9143) can grow in minimal media when sulfur is supplemented with organic (cysteine and methionine) or inorganic (thiosulfate) compounds, and when co-cultured with its fungal host. A related strain of Luteibacter (UNC366Tsa5.1, isolated from the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis) potentially possesses more limited sulfur acquisition pathways than Luteibacter sp. 9143. These results highlight the surprising sulfur requirements of Luteibacter, which may be illustrative of close associations between these strains and eukaryotes, as well as a need for caution when inferring auxotrophies in a focal strain based on differential growth in minimal versus rich media.\\n\\nImportanceSulfate is often used as the sulfur source in minimal media. Here we show that some Luteibacter strains cannot utilize sulfate as a sulfur source, likely due to loss of genes encoding transport proteins. As sulfur requirements for Luteibacter can be met through co-culture with their fungal partner, this knowledge could provide a means to engineer better symbiotic relationships between bacteria and fungi that may be relevant for agriculture. Because growth in minimal media can be restored by supplementation with either cysteine or methionine, and in some cases only methionine, this result highlights how unexpected growth requirements could masquerade as auxotrophy for certain strains and conditions.",

    "abstract": "Beige adipocyte differentiation within white adipose tissue, referred to as browning, is seen as a possible mechanism for increasing energy expenditure. The molecular regulation underlying the thermogenic browning process has not been entirely elucidated. Here, we identify the zinc finger transcription factor EGR1 as a negative regulator of the beige fat program. Loss of Egr1 in mice promotes browning in the absence of external stimulation and activates Ucp1 that encodes the key thermogenic mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1. Moreover, EGR1 is recruited to the proximal region of the Ucp1 promoter in subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue. Transcriptomic analysis of subcutaneous inguinal white adipose tissue in the absence of Egr1 identifies the molecular signature of white adipocyte browning downstream of Egr1 deletion and highlights a concomitant increase of beige differentiation marker and decrease in extracellular matrix gene expression. Conversely, Egr1 overexpression in mesenchymal stem cells decreases beige adipocyte differentiation, while increasing extracellular matrix production. These results uncover the role of Egr1 in blocking energy expenditure via direct Ucp1 transcription regulation and highlight Egr1 as a therapeutic target for counteracting obesity.",

As proof of principle, we use our miniring approach to establish organoids of high-grade serous tumors and one carcinosarcoma of the ovaries and screen hundreds of protein kinase compounds currently FDA-approved or in clinical development. In all cases we could identify drugs causing significant reduction in cell viability, number and size of organoids within a week from surgery, a timeline compatible with therapeutic decision making.",

    "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important and essential roles in eukaryotic gene expression regulating splicing, localization, translation and stability of mRNAs. Understanding the exact contribution of RBPs to gene regulation is crucial as many RBPs are frequently mis-regulated in several neurological diseases and certain cancers. While recently developed techniques provide binding sites of RBPs, they are labor-intensive and generally rely on radioactive labeling of RNA. With more than 1,000 RBPs in a human cell, it is imperative to develop easy, robust, reproducible and high-throughput methods to determine in vivo targets of RBPs. To address these issues we developed uvCLAP (UV crosslinking and affinity purification) as a robust, reproducible method to measure RNA-protein interactions in vivo. To test its performance and applicability we investigated binding of 15 RBPs from fly, mouse and human cells. We show that uvCLAP generates reliable and comparable data to other methods. Unexpectedly, our results show that despite their different subcellular localizations, STAR proteins (KHDRBS1-3, QKI) bind to a similar RNA motif in vivo. Consistently a point mutation (KHDRBS1Y440F) or a natural splice isoform (QKI-6) that changes the respective RBP subcellular localization, dramatically alters target selection without changing the targeted RNA motif. Combined with the knowledge that RBPs can compete and cooperate for binding sites, our data shows that compartmentalization of RBPs can be used as an elegant means to generate RNA target specificity.",

    "abstract": "Transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) have recently emerged as important regulators of protein translation and shown to have diverse biological functions. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms of tsRNA function in the context of dynamic cell-state transitions remain unclear. Here we report the identification of a set of tsRNAs upregulated in differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Mechanistic analyses revealed primary functions of tsRNAs in regulating polysome assembly and translation. Notably, interactome studies with differentially-enriched tsRNAs revealed a switch in associations with  effector RNPs and  target mRNAs in different cell-states. We also demonstrate that a specific pool of tsRNAs can interact with Igf2bp1, an RNA-binding protein, to influence the expression of the pluripotency-promoting factor-c-Myc, thereby providing evidence for tsRNAs in modulating stem cell-states in mESCs. Finally, tsRNA expression analyses in distinct, heterologous cell and tissue models of stem/transformed versus differentiated/normal states reveal that tsRNA-mediated regulation of protein translation may represent a global biological phenomenon associated with cell-state transitions.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryIdentification and functional characterization of tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs) in cell state switches.",
