    "abstract": "Selfish genetic elements (SGEs), such as insertion sequences (ISs) and transposons are found in most genomes. Transposons are usually identifiable by their high copy number within genomes. In contrast REP associated tyrosine transposases (RAYTs), a recently described class of bacterial transposase, are typically present at just one copy per genome. This suggests that RAYTs no longer copy themselves and thus they no longer function as a typical transposase. Motivated by this possibility we interrogated thousands of fully sequenced bacterial genomes in order to determine patterns of RAYT diversity, their distribution across chromosomes and accessory elements, and rate of duplication. RAYTs encompass exceptional diversity and are divisible into at least five distinct groups. They possess features more similar to housekeeping genes than insertion sequences, are predominantly vertically transmitted and have persisted through evolutionary time to the point where they are now found in 24% of all species for which at least one fully sequenced genome is available. Overall, the genomic distribution of RAYTs suggests that they have been co-opted by host genomes to perform a function that benefits the host cell.",

    "abstract": "In the beverage fermentation industry, especially at the craft or micro level, there is a movement to incorporate as many local ingredients as possible to both capture terroir and stimulate local economies. In the case of craft beer, this has traditionally only encompassed locally sourced barley, hops, and other agricultural adjuncts. The identification and use of novel yeasts in brewing lags behind. We sought to bridge this gap by bio-prospecting for wild yeasts, with a focus on the American Midwest. We isolated 284 different strains from 54 species of yeast and have begun to determine their fermentation characteristics. During this work, we found several isolates of five species that produce lactic acid and ethanol during wort fermentation: Hanseniaspora vineae, Lachancea fermentati, Lachancea thermotolerans, Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, and Wickerhamomyces anomalus. Tested representatives of these species yielded excellent attenuation, lactic acid production, and sensory characteristics, positioning them as viable alternatives to lactic acid bacteria (LAB) for the production of sour beers. Indeed, we suggest a new LAB-free paradigm for sour beer production that we term \\\"primary souring\\\" because the lactic acid production and resultant pH decrease occurs during primary fermentation, as opposed to kettle souring or souring via mixed culture fermentation.\\n\\nChemical compounds studied in this article: Lactic acid (PubChem CID: 612); Ethanol (PubChem CID: 702)\\n\\nAbbreviations: ABV, alcohol by volume; DIC, differential interference contrast; EtOH, ethanol; FG, final gravity; gDNA, genomic DNA; IBU, international bittering unit; LAB, lactic acid bacteria; LASSO, lactic acid specific soft-agar overlay; N-J, neighbor-joining; OG, original gravity; WLN, Wallerstein Laboratories nutrient; YPD, yeast extract, peptone, and dextrose",

    "abstract": "BackgroundE. coli ST131-H30 is a globally important pathogen implicated in rising rates of multidrug resistance among E. coli causing extraintestinal infections. Previous studies have focused on adults, leaving the epidemiology of H30 among children undefined.\\n\\nMethodsWe used clinical data and isolates from a case-control study of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli conducted at four US childrens hospitals to estimate the burden and identify host correlates of infection with H30. H30 isolates were identified using two-locus genotyping; host correlates were examined using log-binomial regression models stratified by extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance status.\\n\\nResultsA total of 339 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant and 1008 extended-spectrum cephalosporin-susceptible E. coli isolates were available for analyses. The estimated period prevalence of H30 was 5.3% among all extraintestinal E. coli isolates (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.6%-7.1%); H30 made up 43.3% (81/187) of ESBL-producing isolates in this study. Host correlates of infection with H30 differed by extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance status: among resistant isolates, age [&le;]5 years was positively associated with H30 infection (relative risk [RR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.19-2.83); among susceptible isolates, age [&le;]5 years was negatively associated with H30 (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.27-0.87), while presence of an underlying medical condition was positively associated (RR 4.49, 95% CI 2.43-8.31).\\n\\nConclusionsST131-H30 is less common among extraintestinal E. coli collected from children compared to reported estimates among adults, possibly reflecting infrequent fluoroquinolone use in pediatrics; however, it is similarly dominant among ESBL-producing isolates. The H30 subclone appears to disproportionately affect young children relative to other extendedspectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli.\\n\\nSummaryST131-H30 was responsible for 5.3% of all extraintestinal E. coli infections and 43.3% of ESBL-producing extraintestinal E. coli infections among US children. The clinical and demographic correlates of infection with ST131-H30 differed between extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant and -sensitive isolates.",

    "abstract": "Cotton bacterial blight (CBB), an important disease of (Gossypium hirsutum) in the early 20th century, had been controlled by resistant germplasm for over half a century. Recently, CBB re-emerged as an agronomic problem in the United States. Here, we report analysis of cotton variety planting statistics that indicate a steady increase in the percentage of susceptible cotton varieties grown each year since 2009. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that strains from the current outbreak cluster with race 18 Xanthomonas citri pv. malvacearum (Xcm) strains.\\n\\nIllumina based draft genomes were generated for thirteen Xcm isolates and analyzed along with 4 previously published Xcm genomes. These genomes encode 24 conserved and nine variable type three effectors. Strains in the race 18 clade contain 3 to 5 more effectors than other Xcm strains. SMRT sequencing of two geographically and temporally diverse strains of Xcm yielded circular chromosomes and accompanying plasmids. These genomes encode eight and thirteen distinct transcription activator-like effector genes. RNA-sequencing revealed 52 genes induced within two cotton cultivars by both tested Xcm strains. This gene list includes a homeologous pair of genes, with homology to the known susceptibility gene, MLO. In contrast, the two strains of Xcm induce different clade III SWEET sugar transporters. Subsequent genome wide analysis revealed patterns in the overall expression of homeologous gene pairs in cotton after inoculation by Xcm. These data reveal host-pathogen specificity at the genetic level and strategies for future development of resistant cultivars.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCotton bacterial blight (CBB), caused by Xanthomonas citri pv. malvacearum (Xcm), significantly limited cotton yields in the early 20th century but has been controlled by classical resistance genes for more than 50 years. In 2011, the pathogen re-emerged with a vengeance. In this study, we compare diverse pathogen isolates and cotton varieties to further understand the virulence mechanisms employed by Xcm and to identify promising resistance strategies. We generate fully contiguous genome assemblies for two diverse Xcm strains and identify pathogen proteins used to modulate host transcription and promote susceptibility. RNA-Sequencing of infected cotton reveals novel putative gene targets for the development of durable Xcm resistance. Together, the data presented reveal contributing factors for CBB re-emergence in the U.S. and highlight several promising routes towards the development of durable resistance including classical resistance genes and potential manipulation of susceptibility targets.",

    "abstract": "Defective endocytosis and vesicular trafficking of signaling receptors has recently emerged as a multifaceted hallmark of malignant cells. Clathrin-coated pits (CCPs), the fundamental unit of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, display highly heterogeneous dynamics on the plasma membrane where they can take from 20 seconds to over a minute to form cytosolic coated-vesicles. Despite the large number of cargo molecules that traffic through CCPs, it is not well understood whether signaling receptors activated in cancer, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), are regulated through a specific subset of CCPs. The signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3), which is dephosphorylated by phosphatase tensin homolog (PTEN), is a potent tumorigenic signaling lipid that is present in excess in many types of cancers. Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy and automated tracking and detection of CCPs, we find PTEN and EGF bound EGFR are enriched in a distinct subset of short-lived CCPs that corresponded with clathrin-dependent EGF-induced signaling. By deleting PTEN using CRISPR-Cas9 and reconstituting PTEN, we demonstrate that PTEN plays a role in the regulation of CCP dynamics; this appears to recapitulate CCP dynamics in highly metastatic PTEN-deleted cancer cells where we find a larger proportion of short-lived CCPs and higher initiation density compared to the normal cells. Furthermore, increased PI(3,4,5)P3 results in higher proportion of short-lived CCPs, an effect that recapitulates PTEN deletion. Our findings provide strong evidence for the existence of short-lived  signaling-capable CCPs. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the importance of PTEN and PI(3,4,5)P3 in regulating CCP dynamics and assign a new function to PTEN as a modulator of signaling-capable CCPs.",

    "abstract": "An ideal observer will give equivalent weight to sources of information that are equally reliable. However, when averaging visual information, human observers tend to downweight or discount features that are relatively outlying or deviant ( robust averaging). Why humans adopt an integration policy that discards important decision information remains unknown. Here, observers were asked to judge the average tilt in a circular array of high-contrast gratings, relative to an orientation boundary defined by a central reference grating. Observers showed robust averaging of orientation, but the extent to which they did so was a positive predictor of their overall performance. Using computational simulations, we show that although robust averaging is suboptimal for a perfect integrator, it paradoxically enhances performance in the presence of \\\"late\\\" noise, i.e. which corrupts decisions during integration. In other words, robust decision strategies increase the brains resilience to noise arising in neural computations during decision-making.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHumans often make decisions by averaging information from multiple sources. When all the sources are equally reliable, they should all have equivalent impact (or weight) on the decisions of an \\\"ideal\\\" observer, i.e. one with perfect memory. However, recent experiments have suggested that humans give unequal weight to sources that are deviant or unusual, a phenomenon called \\\"robust averaging\\\". Here, we use computer simulations to try to understand why humans do this. Our simulations show that under the assumption that information processing is limited by a source of internal uncertainty that we call \\\"late\\\" noise, robust averaging actually leads to improved performance. Using behavioural testing, we replicate the finding of robust averaging in a cohort of healthy humans, and show that those participants that engage in robust averaging perform better on the task. This study thus provides new information about the limitations on human decision-making.",

The key issue is that since parental lines were not available, might the reported variants have been inherited? To expand upon the limited available whole genome data on whether CRISPR-edited mice show more genetic variation, whole-genome sequencing was performed on two other mouse lines that had undergone a CRISPR-editing procedure. Again, parents were not available for either the Capn5 nor Fblim1 CRISPR-edited mouse lines, so strain controls were examined. Additionally, we also include verification of variants detected in the initial mouse line. Taken together, these whole-genome-sequencing-level results support the idea that in specific cases, CRISPR-Cas9 editing can precisely edit the genome at the organismal level and may not introduce numerous, unintended, off-target mutations.",

To investigate the molecular mechanism by which pro-myostatin remains latent, we have solved the structure of unprocessed promyostatin and analysed the properties of the protein in its different forms. Crystal structures and SAXS analyses show that pro-myostatin adopts an open, V-shaped structure with a domain-swapped arrangement. The pro-mature complex, after cleavage of the furin site, has significantly reduced activity compared with mature growth factor and persists as a stable complex that is resistant to the natural antagonist follistatin. The latency appears to be conferred by a number of distinct features that collectively stabilise the interaction of the pro-domains with the mature growth factor, enabling a regulated step-wise activation process, distinct from the prototypical pro-TGF-{beta}1. These results provide a basis for understanding the effect of missense mutations in pro-myostatin and pave the way for the design of novel myostatin inhibitors.",

GDF8 is held in a latent state through interactions with its N-terminal prodomain, much like TGF-{beta} Using a combination of small angle X-ray scattering and mutagenesis, we characterized the interactions of GDF8 with its prodomain. Our results show that the prodomain:GDF8 complex can exist in a fully latent state and an activated or  triggered state where the prodomain remains in complex with the mature domain. However, these states are not reversible, indicating the latent GDF8 is  spring-loaded. Structural analysis shows that the prodomain:GDF8 complex adopts an  open configuration, distinct from the latency state of TGF- and more similar to the  open state of Activin A and BMP9 (non-latent complexes). We determined that GDF{beta}8 maintains similar features for latency, including the alpha-1 helix and fastener elements, and identified a series of mutations in the prodomain of GDF8 that alleviate latency, including I56E, which does not require activation by the protease Tolloid. In vivo, active GDF8 variants were potent negative regulators of muscle mass, compared to wild-type GDF8. Collectively, these results help characterize the latency and activation mechanisms of GDF8.",

    "abstract": "Animals are proposed to learn the latent rules governing their environment in order to maximize their chances of survival. However, rules may change without notice, forcing animals to keep a memory of which one is currently at work. Rule switching can lead to situations in which the same stimulus/response pairing is positively and negatively rewarded in the long run, depending on variables that are not accessible to the animal. This fact rises questions on how neural systems are capable of reinforcement learning in environments where the reinforcement is inconsistent. Here we address this issue by asking about which aspects of connectivity, neural excitability and synaptic plasticity are key for a very general, stochastic spiking neural network model to solve a task in which rules change without being cued, taking the serial reversal task (SRT) as paradigm. Contrary to what could be expected, we found strong limitations for biologically plausible networks to solve the SRT. Especially, we proved that no network of neurons can learn a SRT if it is a single neural population that integrates stimuli information and at the same time is responsible of choosing the behavioural response. This limitation is independent of the number of neurons, neuronal dynamics or plasticity rules, and arises from the fact that plasticity is locally computed at each synapse, and that synaptic changes and neuronal activity are mutually dependent processes. We propose and characterize a spiking neural network model that solves the SRT, which relies on separating the functions of stimuli integration and response selection. The model suggests that experimental efforts to understand neural function should focus on the characterization of neural circuits according to their connectivity, neural dynamics, and the degree of modulation of synaptic plasticity with reward.",

    "abstract": "Information on genetic relationships among individuals is essential to many studies of the behavior and ecology of wild organisms. Parentage and relatedness assays based on large numbers of SNP loci hold substantial advantages over the microsatellite markers traditionally used for these purposes. We present a double-digest restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD-seq) analysis pipeline that, as such, simultaneously achieves the SNP discovery and genotyping steps and which is optimized to return a statistically powerful set of SNP markers (typically 150-600 after stringent filtering) from large numbers of individuals (up to 240 per run). We explore the tradeoffs inherent in this approach through a set of experiments in a species with a complex social system, the variegated fairy-wren (Malurus lamberti), and further validate it in a phylogenetically broad set of other bird species. Through direct comparisons with a parallel dataset from a robust panel of highly variable microsatellite markers, we show that this ddRAD-seq approach results in substantially improved power to discriminate among potential relatives and considerably more precise estimates of relatedness coefficients. The pipeline is designed to be universally applicable to all bird species (and with minor modifications to many other taxa), to be cost- and time-efficient, and to be replicable across independent runs such that genotype data from different study periods can be combined and analyzed as field samples are accumulated.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of personalised medicine in childhood cancers has been limited by a lack of clinically validated multi-target sequencing approaches specific for paediatric solid tumours. In order to support innovative clinical trials in high-risk patients with unmet need, we have developed a clinically relevant targeted sequencing panel spanning 311 kb and comprising 78 genes involved in childhood cancers. A total of 132 samples were used for the validation of the panel, including Horizon Discovery cell blends (n=4), cell lines (n=15), formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE, n=83) and fresh frozen tissue (FF, n=30) patient samples. Cell blends containing known single nucleotide variants (SNVs, n=528) and small insertion-deletions (indels n=108) were used to define panel sensitivities of [&ge;]98% for SNVs and [&ge;]83% for indels [95% CI] and panel specificity of [&ge;]98% [95% CI] for SNVs. FFPE samples performed comparably to FF samples (n=15 paired). Of 95 well-characterised genetic abnormalities in 33 clinical specimens and 13 cell lines (including SNVs, indels, amplifications, rearrangements and chromosome losses), 94 (98.9%) were detected by our approach. We have validated a robust and practical methodology to guide clinical management of children with solid tumours based on their molecular profiles.

Their pharmacological control hence represents a potential therapeutic avenue. Yoda1, a Piezo1-selective small molecule agonist, is the only known selective Piezo modulator. How Yoda1 selectively interacts with Piezo1 and opens its pore is unknown. Here, by engineering and characterizing chimeras, we identified a minimal region responsible for Yoda1 binding. This region is located at the interface between the pore and the putative mechanosensory domains in each subunit. By characterizing hybrid channels containing Yoda1-insensitive and Yoda1-sensitive monomers, we demonstrate that the presence of only one Yoda1-sensitive Piezo1 subunit is sufficient for chemical activation, implicating that the asymmetric binding of Yoda1 to a single subunit enables channel opening. These findings shed light onto the gating mechanisms of Piezo channels and will pave the way for the rationale design of new Piezo channels modulators.",

All methods were validated using both a random split validation and a temporal validation, with the latter being a more realistic benchmark of expected prospective execution.\\n\\nDeep Neural Networks are the top performing classifiers, highlighting the added value of Deep Neural Networks over other more conventional methods. Moreover, the best method ( DNN_PCM) performed significantly better at almost one standard deviation higher than the mean performance. Furthermore, Multi task and PCM implementations were shown to improve performance over single task Deep Neural Networks. Conversely, target prediction performed almost two standard deviations under the mean performance. Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression performed around mean performance. Finally, using an ensemble of DNNs, alongside additional tuning, enhanced the relative performance by another 27% (compared with unoptimized DNN_PCM).\\n\\nHere, a standardized set to test and evaluate different machine learning algorithms in the context of multitask learning is offered by providing the data and the protocols.",

    "abstract": "Genomic transposable elements (TEs) comprise nearly half of the human genome. The expression of TEs is considered potentially hazardous, as it can lead to insertional mutagenesis and genomic instability. However, recent studies have revealed that TEs are involved in immune-mediated cell clearance. Hypomethylating agents can increase the expression of TEs in cancer cells, inducing  viral mimicry, causing interferon signalling and cancer cell killing. To investigate the role of TEs in the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), we studied TE expression in several cell fractions of AML while tracking its development (pre-leukemic haematopoietic stem cells, leukemic stem cells [LSCs], and leukemic blasts). LSCs, which are resistant to chemotherapy and serve as reservoirs for relapse, showed significant suppression of TEs and interferon pathways. Similarly, high-risk cases of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) showed far greater suppression of TEs than low-risk cases. We propose TE suppression as a mechanism for immune escape in AML and MDS. Repression of TEs co-occurred with the upregulation of several genes known to modulate TE expression, such as RNA helicases and autophagy genes. Thus, we have identified potential pathways that can be targeted to activate cancer immunogenicity via TEs in AML and MDS.",

How the cell regulates cohesin to perform these distinct functions remains to be elucidated. One cohesin regulator, Wpl1p, was characterized in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as a promoter of cohesion and as an inhibitor of condensation. Here we provide evidence that Wpl1p has an additional function in promoting the timely repair of DNA damage induced during S-phase. In addition to these biological functions, Wpl1p has been implicated as an inhibitor of cohesins ability to stably bind DNA by modulating the interface between two subunits (Mcd1p and Smc3p) of the core cohesin complex. We show that Wpl1p likely modulates this interface to regulate all cohesins biological functions. Furthermore, we show that Wpl1p regulates cohesion and condensation through the formation of a functional complex with another cohesin-associated factor, Pds5p. In contrast, Wpl1p regulates DNA repair independently of its interaction with Pds5p. Together these results suggest that Wpl1p regulates distinct biological functions of cohesin by Pds5p-dependent and - independent modulation of the Smc3p-Mcd1p interface.",

    "abstract": "ciRS-7 is an intensely studied, highly expressed and conserved circRNA. Essentially nothing is known about its biogenesis, including the location of its promoter. A prevailing assumption has been that ciRS-7 is an exceptional circRNA because it is transcribed from a locus lacking any mature linear RNA transcripts of the same sense. Our interest in the biogenesis of ciRS-7 led us to develop an algorithm to define its promoter. This approach predicted that the human ciRS-7 promoter coincides with that of the long non-coding RNA, LINC00632. We validated this prediction using multiple orthogonal experimental assays. We also used computational approaches and experimental validation to establish that ciRS-7 exonic sequence is embedded in linear transcripts that are flanked by cryptic exons in both human and mouse. Together, this experimental and computational evidence generate a new view of regulation in this locus: (a) ciRS-7 is like other circRNAs, as it is spliced into linear transcripts; (b) expression of ciRS-7 is primarily determined by the chromatin state of LINC00632 promoters; (c) transcription and splicing factors sufficient for ciRS-7 biogenesis are expressed in cells that lack detectable ciRS-7 expression. These findings have significant implications for the study of the regulation and function of ciRS-7, and the analytic framework we developed to jointly analyze RNA-seq and ChlP-seq data reveal the potential for genome-wide discovery of important biological regulation missed in current reference annotations.\\n\\nAuthor SummarycircRNAs were recently discovered to be a significant product of  host gene expression programs but little is known about their transcriptional regulation. Here, we have studied the expression of a well-known circRNA named ciRS-7. ciRS-7 has an unusual function for a circRNA; it is believed to be a miRNA sponge. Previously, ciRS-7 was thought to be transcribed from a locus lacking any mature linear isoforms, unlike all other circular RNAs known to be expressed in human cells. However, we have found this to be false; using a combination of bioinformatic and experimental genetic approaches, in both human and mouse, we discovered that linear transcripts containing the ciRS-7 exonic sequence, linking it to upstream genes. This suggests the potential for additional functional roles of this important locus and provides critical information to begin study on the biogenesis of ciRS-7.",

Using TRiP we show that a memory-inducing experience creates a distinct translational state in mouse CA1 pyramidal cells. The experience-dependent translation state is characterized by enhanced translation of protein-coding open reading frames (ORFs) including numerous components of the actin cytoskeleton and calcium/calmodulin binding proteins, and by decreased translation of a defined subset of genes containing upstream ORFs (uORFs). Using animals heterozygous for an unphosphorylatable allele of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), we show that dephosphorylation of eIF2 contributes significantly to the experience-dependent translation state.

    "abstract": "Mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) infection induces phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2 which promotes formation of discrete cytoplasmic inclusions, termed stress granules (SGs). SGs are emerging as a component of the innate immune response to virus infection, and modulation of SG assembly is a common mechanism employed by viruses to counter this antiviral response. We previously showed that MRV infection induces SGs early, then interferes with SG formation as infection proceeds. In this work, we found that SG associated proteins localized to the periphery of virus-encoded cytoplasmic structures, termed virus factories (VFs), where viral transcription, translation, and replication occur. The localization of SG proteins to VFs was dependent on polysome dissociation and occurred via association of SG effector protein, G3BP1, with MRV non-structural protein {sigma}NS, which localizes to VFs via association with VF nucleating protein, NS. Deletion analysis of the {sigma}NS RNA binding domain and G3BP1 RNA (RRM) and ribosomal (RGG) binding domains showed that the association and VF localization of G3BP1 is not occurring solely through RNA or ribosomal binding, but requires both RNA and ribosomal binding domains of G3BP1 for maximal VFL localization and {sigma}NS association. Co-expression of {sigma}NS and NS resulted in disruption of normal SG puncta, and in cells lacking G3BP1, MRV replication was enhanced in a manner correlating with strain-dependent induction of host translation shutoff. These results suggest that {sigma}NS association with and relocalization of G3BP1 to the VF periphery plays a role in SG disruption to facilitate MRV replication in the host translational shutoff environment.\\n\\nIMPORTANCESGs and SG effector proteins have emerged as important, yet poorly understood, players in the hosts innate immune response to virus infection. MRV infection induces SGs early during infection that are dispersed and/or prevented from forming during late stages of infection despite continued activation of the eIF2 signaling pathway. Cellular and viral components involved in disruption of SGs during late stages of MRV infection remain to be elucidated. This work provides evidence that MRV disruption of SGs may be facilitated by association of MRV non-structural protein {sigma}NS with major SG effector protein G3BP1 and subsequent localization of G3BP1 and other SG associated proteins around the periphery of virus encoded factories, interrupting the normal formation of SGs. Our findings also reveal the importance of G3BP1 as an inhibitor of MRV replication during infection for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Cholera is a severe, waterborne diarrheal disease caused by toxin-producing strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Comparative genomics has revealed \\\"waves\\\" of cholera transmission and evolution, in which clones are successively replaced over decades and centuries. However, the extent of V. cholerae genetic diversity within an epidemic or even within an individual patient is poorly understood. Here, we characterized V. cholerae genomic diversity at a micro-epidemiological level within and between individual patients from Bangladesh and Haiti. To capture within-patient diversity, we isolated multiple (8 to 20) V. cholerae colonies from each of eight patients, sequenced their genomes and identified point mutations and gene gain/loss events. We found limited but detectable diversity at the level of point mutations within hosts (zero to three single nucleotide variants within each patient), and comparatively higher gene content variation within hosts (at least one gain/loss event per patient, and up to 103 events in one patient). Much of the gene content variation appeared to be due to gain and loss of phage and plasmids within the V. cholerae population, with occasional exchanges between V. cholerae and other members of the gut microbiota. We also show that certain intra-host variants have phenotypic consequences. For example, the acquisition of a Bacteroides plasmid and nonsynonymous mutations in a sensor histidine kinase gene both reduced biofilm formation, an important trait for environmental survival. Together, our results show that V. cholerae is measurably evolving within patients, with possible implications for disease outcomes and transmission dynamics.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryVibrio cholerae is the etiological agent of cholera, a severe diarrheal disease endemic to Bangladesh and responsible for global outbreaks, including one ongoing in Haiti. Certain bacterial pathogens can evolve and diversify within the human host, often altering virulence and antibiotic resistance. However, most examples of within-host evolution have come from chronic infections, in which the pathogen has sufficient time to mutate and diversify, and little attention has been paid to more acute infections such as the one caused by V. cholerae. The goal of this study was to measure the extent of within-host evolution of V. cholerae within individual infected patients. By sequencing multiple bacterial isolates_from each of eight patients from Bangladesh and Haiti, we found that cholera patients can harbor a diverse population of V. cholerae. As expected for an acute infection, this diversity is limited, ranging from zero to three point mutations (single nucleotide variants) per patient. However, gene gain/loss events are more prevalent than point mutations, occurring in every single patient, and sometimes involving the transfer of dozens of genes on plasmids. Even if rare, point mutations and gene gain/loss events may be maintained by natural selection, and can alter clinically-and environmentally-relevant phenotypes such as biofilm formation. Therefore, within-patient evolution has the potential to impact clinical and epidemiological outcomes. Together, our results demonstrate that within-patient evolution may be a general feature of both acute and chronic infections, and that gene gain/loss may be an important but under-appreciated feature of within-host evolution.",

The resulting software proves to be flexible and easily extensible in Python, while building on the PyTorch library [32], which was previously used successfully in deep learning applications, for just-in-time optimization and compilation of the model onto CPU or GPU architectures. An alternative implementation based on Theano [33] is also available, although not fully supported.\\n\\nThrough automatic differentiation, any parameter of a specified model can be optimized to approach a desired output which is a significant improvement over e.g. Monte Carlo or particle optimizations without gradients. We show that a number of models including even complex non-linearities such as contrast gain control and spiking mechanisms can be implemented easily.\\n\\nWe show in this paper that we can in particular recreate the simulation results of a popular retina simulation software VirtualRetina [35], with the added benefit of providing (1) arbitrary linear filters instead of the product of Gaussian and exponential filters and (2) optimization routines utilizing the gradients of the model. We demonstrate the utility of 3d convolution filters with a simple direction selective filter. Also we show that it is possible to optimize the input for a certain goal, rather than the parameters, which can aid the design of experiments as well as closed-loop online stimulus generation. Yet, Convis is more than a retina simulator. For instance it can also predict the response of V1 orientation selective cells.\\n\\nConvis is open source under the GPL-3.0 license and available from https://github.com/jahuth/convis/ with documentation at https://jahuth.github.io/convis/.",

    "abstract": "Whether humans are optimal decision makers is still a debated issue in the realm of perceptual decisions. Taking advantage of the direct link between an optimal decision-making and the confidence in that decision, we offer a new dual-decisions method of inferring such confidence without asking for its explicit valuation. Our method circumvents the well-known miscalibration issue with explicit confidence reports as well as the specification of the cost-function required by  opt-out or post-decision wagering methods. We show that observers inferred confidence in their first decision and its use in a subsequent decision (conditioned upon the correctness of the first) fall short of both the ideal Bayesian strategy, as well as of an under-sampling approximation or a modified Bayesian strategy augmented with an additional bias term to accommodate global miscalibration of confidence. The observed data are instead significantly better fitted by a model positing that observers use only few confidence levels or states, at odds with the continuous confidence function of stimulus level prescribed by a normative behavior. These findings question the validity of normative-Bayesian accounts of subjective confidence and metaperceptual judgments.",

    "abstract": "When weighing evidence for a decision, individuals are continually faced with the choice of whether to gather more information or act on what has already been learned. The present experiment employed a self-paced category learning task and fMRI to examine the neural mechanisms underlying stopping of information search and how they contribute to choice accuracy. Participants learned to classify triads of face, object, and scene cues into one of two categories using a rule based on one of the stimulus dimensions. After each trial, participants were given the option to explicitly solve the rule or continue learning. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) was used to examine activation of rule-relevant information on trials leading up to a decision to solve the rule. We found that activation of rule-relevant information increased leading up to participants stopping decisions. Stopping was associated with widespread activation that included medial prefrontal cortex and visual association areas. Engagement of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was associated with accurate stopping, and activation in this region was functionally coupled with signal in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Results suggest that activating rule information when deciding whether to stop an information search increases choice accuracy, and that the response profile of vmPFC during such decisions may provide an index of effective learning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVolatile carboxylic acids, alcohols, and esters are natural fermentative products, typically derived from anaerobic digestion. These metabolites have important functional roles to regulate cellular metabolisms and broad use as food supplements, flavors and fragrances, solvents, and fuels. Comprehensive characterization of toxic effects of these metabolites on microbial growth under similar conditions is very limited.\\n\\nResultsWe characterized a comprehensive list of 32 short-chain carboxylic acids, alcohols, and esters on microbial growth of Escherichia coli MG1655 under anaerobic conditions. We analyzed toxic effects of these metabolites on E. coli health, quantified by growth rate and cell mass, as a function of metabolite types, concentrations, and physiochemical properties including carbon chain lengths and associated functional groups, chain branching features, hydrophobicity, and energy density. Strain characterization reveals these metabolites exerted distinct toxic effects on E. coli health. We find that higher concentrations and/or longer carbon lengths of metabolites cause more severe growth inhibition. For the same carbon lengths and metabolite concentrations, alcohols are most toxic followed by acids then esters. We also discover that branched chain metabolites are less toxic than linear chain metabolites for the same carbon lengths and metabolite concentrations. Remarkably, shorter alkyl esters (e.g., ethyl butyrate) are found to be less toxic than longer alkyl esters (e.g., butyl acetate) for the same carbon lengths and metabolite concentrations. Regardless of metabolite types, longer chain metabolites are less soluble and have higher energy densities but are more toxic to microbial growth.\\n\\nConclusionsMetabolite hydrophobicity, correlated with carbon chain length, associated functional group, chain branching feature, and energy density, is a good quantitative index to evaluate toxic effect of a metabolite on microbial health. The results provide better understanding of degrees of toxicity of fermentative metabolites on microbial growth and further help selection of desirable metabolites and hosts for industrial fermentation to overproduce them.",

To demonstrate the applicability of TXTL, we rapidly measure guide RNA-dependent DNA cleavage and gene repression for single- and multi-effector CRISPR-Cas systems, accurately predict the strength of gene repression in E. coli, quantify the inhibitory activity of anti-CRISPR proteins, and develop a fast and scalable high-throughput screen for protospacer-adjacent motifs.

While several theories regarding the evolution of the genetic code have been proposed, experimental exploration of these theories has largely been restricted to phylogenetic and computational modeling. The development of orthogonal translation systems has allowed noncanonical amino acids to be inserted at will into proteins. We have taken advantage of these advances to evolve bacteria to accommodate a 21 amino acid genetic code in which the amber codon ambiguously encodes either 3-nitro-L-tyrosine or stop. Such an ambiguous encoding strategy recapitulates numerous models for genetic code expansion, and we find that evolved lineages first accommodate the unnatural amino acid, and then begin to evolve on a neutral landscape where stop codons begin to appear within genes. The resultant lines represent transitional intermediates on the way to the fixation of a functional 21 amino acid code.",

In this study, we identified genes and genetic networks involved in disease resistance in grapevines by comparing the transcriptomes of a strongly resistant clone of Chinese wild grapevine (Vitis davidii cv. Ciputao 941, DAC) and a susceptible clone of European grapevine (Vitis vinifera cv. Manicure Finger, VIM) before and after infection with white rot disease (Coniella diplodiella). Disease resistance-related genes were triggered in DAC approximately 12 hours post infection (hpi) with C. diplodiella. Twenty candidate resistant genes were co-expressed in DAC. One of these candidate genes, VdWRKY53 (GenBank accession KY124243), was over-expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants and was found to provide these plants with enhanced resistance to C. diplodiella, Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato PDC3000, and Golovinomyces cichoracearum. This result indicates that VdWRKY53 may be involved in nonspecific resistance via interaction with fungal and oomycete elicitor signals and the activation of defence gene expression.

    "abstract": "The kinetics of ligand dissociation has been found to be crucial for a good drug candidate. Therefore, examining the underlying free energy profile of the dissociation that governs the kinetics becomes important. Umbrella sampling (US), a widely used free energy calculation method, has long been used to explore the dissociation process of ligand-receptor systems. The potential of mean force (PMF) computed from US seems to always produce binding affinity and energy barriers that more or less agree with experiments. However, such PMFs are influenced by many practical aspects, like the method used to generate the initial dissociation pathway, collective variables (CVs) that used to describe the reaction coordinate (RC), and how intensive the sampling is in the conformational space restrained by the CVs. These critical factors were rarely studied. Here we applied US to study the dissociation processes of {beta}-cyclodextrin ({beta}-CD) and p38 complex systems. For {beta}-CD, we used three different {beta}-CD conformations to generate the dissociation path manually. For p38, we generated the dissociation pathway using accelerated molecular dynamics (AMD) followed by conformational relaxing with short conventional molecular dynamics (MD), steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and manual pulling. We found that even for small {beta}-CD complexes, different {beta}-CD conformations will alter the height of the PMF and different dissociation directions result in appearance/disappearance of local minima. SMD poorly samples the residue sidechain movement, leading to overestimated height of PMF. On the other hand, the AMD pathway relaxed by short conventional MD sampled more accurate structures, resulting in reasonable PMF.",

    "abstract": "We performed computational research to investigate the mechanism by which cyclodextrins (CDs) catalyze Diels-Alder reactions between 9-anthracenemethanol and N-cyclohexylmaleimide. Hydrogen bonds (Hbonds) between N-cyclohexylmaleimide and the hydroxyl groups of cyclodextrins were suggested to play an important role in the catalysis.However, our free energy calculations and molecular dynamics simulations showed that these Hbonds are not stable, and quantum mechanics calculations suggested that the reaction is not promoted by these Hbonds. The binding of 9-anthracenemethanol and N-cyclohexylmaleimide to cyclodextrins was the key to the catalysis. Cyclodextrins act as a container to hold the two reactants in the cavity, pre-organizes them for the reactions, and thus reduces the entropy penalty to the activation free energy. Dimethyl-{beta}-CD was a better catalyst for this specific reaction than {beta}-CD because of its stronger van der Waals interaction with the pre-organized reactants and better performance in reducing the activation energy. This computational work sheds light on the mechanism of the catalytic reaction by cyclodextrins and introduces new perspectives of supramolecular catalysis.",

    "abstract": "This study applies a novel computational strategy to investigate molecular recognition and binding kinetics using five pyrazolourea ligands dissociating from cyclin-dependent kinase 8 with cyclin C (CDK8/CycC) as an example. The computed free energy barriers guide designing compounds using the transient conformations unavailable in experiments. The intermediates and their free energy profile during ligand association and discussion processes control ligand-protein binding kinetics and bring a more complete picture of ligand-protein binding. We used metadynamics and a pathway search method to sample pathways and applied combined reduced dimensionality, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and milestoning theory to construct the free energy profile and estimate the residence time. The binding free energy and the trend of binding kinetics agreed with experiments. We explain the why of the barriers and the kinetics and use the information to assist ligand design. Guided by a barrier of a ligand passing an C helix and activation loop, we introduced one hydroxyl group to parent compounds to design our ligands with increased residence time and validated our prediction by experiments. This work provides a novel and robust approach to investigate dissociation kinetics of large and flexible systems for understanding unbinding mechanisms and designing new small molecule drugs with desired binding kinetics.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe transient conformations during ligand binding/unbinding control non-covalent binding kinetics. However, the transient structures and their free energy landscape of flexible ligand-protein systems are unavailable in experiments and challenging to model. Due to lack of understanding in binding kinetics, even scientists know that kinetic properties can be important in drug development, calculations using the intermediate states to design ligands with preferred binding kinetics are absent. We overcome these challenges and compute ligand-protein unbinding free energy profile using a novel method with molecular dynamics simulations, reduced dimensionality, and milestoning theory to deepen our understanding in molecular recognition. We also designed compounds based on the computed free energy barriers and experimentally validated that our designed compound can increase residence time.",

    "abstract": "The activities of CDK8 with partner Cyclin C (CycC) are a common feature of many diseases, especially cancers. Here we report the study of dynamic behaviors and energy profiles of 13 CDK8/CycC systems, including the DMG-in and DMG-out conformations as well as 5 type I ligands and 5 type II ligands, with all-atom unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We observed numerous regional motions within CDK8, which move in concert to form five major protein motions. The motion of the activation loop doesnt appear to influence the binding of both types of ligands. Type I ligands remarkably reduce the motion of the C-terminal tail through the strong cation-{pi} interaction between the ligands and ARG356, and type II ligands stabilize the C helix by forming stable hydrogen bonds with GLU66. The MD calculations also confirmed the importance of CycC to the stability of the CDK8 system as well as the ligand binding. The MMPB/SA results show that van der Waals interaction is the main driving force for the binding of both types of ligands, but electrostatic energy and entropy penalty plays important roles in the binding of type II ligands. The volume analysis results indicate that the induced fitting theory applies in the binding of type I ligands. These results would help to improve the affinities of the existing ligands. Our MD work is complementary to crystal structures and may have implications in the development of new CDK8 inhibitors as well as in the field of drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPCAPBSTRACTC_SCPCAPPositive density dependence can create a threshold of population states below which extinction of the population occurs. The existence of this threshold, which can often be a complex, multi-dimensional surface, rather than a single point, is of particular importance in degraded populations for which there is a desire for successful restoration. Here, we incorporated positive density dependence into a closed, size- and age-structured integral projection model parameterized with empirical data from an Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, population in Pamlico Sound, North Carolina. To understand the properties of the threshold surface, and implications for restoration, we introduced a general method based on a linearization of the threshold surface at its unique, unstable equilibrium. We estimated the number of oysters of a particular age (i.e. stock enhancement), or the surface area of hard substrate required (i.e. habitat enhancement), to move a population from an extinction trajectory to a persistent trajectory. The location of the threshold surface was strongly affected by changes in the amount of local larval retention. Traditional stock enhancement with oysters less than a year old (i.e. spat) required three times as many oysters relative to stock enhancement with oysters between ages three and seven, while the success of habitat enhancement depended upon the initial size distribution of the population. The methodology described here demonstrates the importance of considering positive density dependence in oyster populations, and also provides insights into effective management and restoration strategies when dealing with a high dimensional threshold separating extinction and persistence.",

    "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) is one of three crops, along with rice and wheat, responsible for more than 1/2 of all calories consumed around the world. Increasing the yield and stress tolerance of these crops is essential to meet the growing need for food. The cost and speed of plant phenotyping is currently the largest constraint on plant breeding efforts. Datasets linking new types of high throughput phenotyping data collected from plants to the performance of the same genotypes under agronomic conditions across a wide range of environments are essential for developing new statistical approaches and computer vision based tools. A set of maize inbreds - primarily recently off patent lines - were phenotyped using a high throughput platform at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. These lines have been previously subjected to high density genotyping, and scored for a core set of 13 phenotypes in field trials across 13 North American states in two years by the Genomes to Fields consortium. A total of 485 GB of image data including RGB, hyperspectral, fluorescence and thermal infrared photos has been released. Correlations between image-based measurements and manual measurements demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying variation in plant architecture using image data. However, naive approaches to measuring traits such as biomass can introduce nonrandom measurement errors confounded with genotype variation. Analysis of hyperspectral image data demonstrated unique signatures from stem tissue. Integrating heritable phenotypes from high-throughput phenotyping data with field data from different environments can reveal previously unknown factors influencing yield plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Plant morphogenesis is strongly dependent on the directional growth and the subsequent oriented division of individual cells. It has been shown that the plant cortical microtubule array plays a key role in controlling both these processes. This ordered structure emerges as the collective result of stochastic interactions between large numbers of dynamic microtubules. To elucidate this complex self-organization process a number of analytical and computational approaches to study the dynamics of cortical microtubules have been proposed. To date, however, these models have been restricted to 2D planes or geometrically simple surfaces in 3D, which strongly limits their applicability as plant cells display a wide variety of shapes. This limitation is even more acute, as both local as well as global geometrical features of cells are expected to influence the overall organization of the array. Here we describe a framework for efficiently simulating microtubule dynamics on triangulated approximations of arbitrary three dimensional surfaces. This allows the study of microtubule array organization on realistic cell surfaces obtained by segmentation of microscopic images. We validate the framework against expected or known results for the spherical and cubical geometry. We then use it to systematically study the individual contributions of global geometry, edge-induced catastrophes and cell face-induced stability to array organization in a cuboidal geometry. Finally, we apply our framework to analyze the highly non-trivial geometry of leaf pavement cells of Nicotiana benthamiana and Hedera helix. We show that our simulations can predict multiple features of the array structure in these cells, revealing, among others, strong constraints on the orientation of division planes.",

    "abstract": "Since the first evidence for cancer stem cells in leukemia, experimentalists have sought to identify tumorigenic subpopulations in solid tumors. In parallel, scientists have argued over the implications of the existence of this subpopulation. On one side, the cancer stem cell hypothesis posits that a small subset of cells within a tumor are responsible for tumorigenesis and are capable of recapitulating the entire tumor on their own. Under this hypothesis, a tumor may be conceptualized as a series of coupled compartments, representing populations of progressively differentiated cell types, starting from stem cells. The allure of this model is that it elegantly explains our therapeutic failures: we have been targeting the wrong cells. Alternatively, the stochastic model states that all cells in a tumor can have stem-like properties, and have an equally small capability of forming a tumor. As tumors are, by nature, heterogeneous, there is ample evidence to support both hypotheses. We propose a mechanistic mathematical description that integrates these two theories, settling the dissonance between the schools of thought and providing a road map for integrating disparate experimental results into a single theoretical framework. We present experimental results from clonogenic assays that demonstrate the importance of defining this novel formulation, and the clarity that is provided when interpreting these results through the lens of this formulation.",

Upon incubation with or without insulin, repressed tumor cell proliferation and downregulated tumor marker expression occur accompanying with mitigated oxidative stress and compromised apoptosis. Mechanistically, insulin resistance-abrogated glucose uptake was suggested to create an intracellular low-glucose milieu, leading to cellular starvation resembling calorie restriction (CR). While downregulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) occurring in CR was validated, oncogene downregulation and tumor suppressor gene upregulation seen in CR was also replicated by NOS2 knockdown.\\n\\nConclusions/SignificanceCellular starvation can exert CR-like anti-tumor effects regardless of insulin presence or absence.",

    "abstract": "In bacteria, the canonical mechanism of translational repression by small RNAs (sRNAs) involves sRNA-mRNA base pairing that occludes the ribosome binding site (RBS), directly preventing translation. In this mechanism, the sRNA is the direct regulator, while the RNA chaperone Hfq plays a supporting role by stabilizing the sRNA. There are a few examples where the sRNA does not directly interfere with ribosome binding, yet translation of the target mRNA is still inhibited. Mechanistically, this non-canonical regulation by sRNAs is poorly understood. Our previous work demonstrated repression of the mannose transporter manX mRNA by the sRNA SgrS, but the regulatory mechanism was unknown. Here, we report that manX translation is controlled by a molecular role-reversal mechanism where Hfq, not the sRNA, is the direct repressor. Hfq binding adjacent to the manX RBS is required for sRNA-mediated translational repression. Translation of manX is also regulated by another sRNA, DicF, via the same non-canonical Hfq-dependent mechanism. Our results suggest that the sRNAs recruit Hfq to its binding site or stabilize the mRNA-Hfq complex. This work adds to the growing number of examples of diverse mechanisms of translational regulation by sRNAs in bacteria.",

The impact of normative variability in caregiving on such biobehavioral processes, however, is poorly understood. Here, we provide initial evidence that even subtle variability in normative caregiving shapes threat-related brain function and, potentially, associated psychopathology in adolescence. Specifically, we report that greater familial affective responsiveness is associated with heightened amygdala reactivity to interpersonal threat, particularly in adolescents having experienced relatively low recent stress. These findings extend the literature on the effects of caregiving extremes on brain function to subtle, normative variability, but suggest that presumably protective factors may be associated with increased risk-related amygdala reactivity. We consider these paradoxical associations with regard to studies of basic associative threat learning and further consider their relevance for understanding potential effects of caregiving on psychological development.",

The widely accepted hypothesis is that nodulation evolved independently multiple times, with only a few losses. However, insight in the evolutionary trajectory of nodulation is lacking. We conducted comparative studies using Parasponia (Cannabaceae), the only non-legume able to establish nitrogen fixing nodules with rhizobium. This revealed that Parasponia and legumes utilize a large set of orthologous symbiosis genes. Comparing genomes of Parasponia and its non-nodulating relative Trema did not reveal specific gene duplications that could explain a recent gain of nodulation in Parasponia. Rather, Trema and other non-nodulating species in the Order Rosales show evidence of pseudogenization or loss of key symbiosis genes. This demonstrates that these species have lost the potential to nodulate. This finding challenges a long-standing hypothesis on evolution of nitrogen-fixing symbioses, and has profound implications for translational approaches aimed at engineering nitrogen-fixing nodules in crop plants.",

    "abstract": "Non-human primates constitute an indispensable model system for studying higher brain functions at the neurophysiological level. They can be trained on highly demanding cognitive tasks, and studies involving these animals elucidated the neuronal mechanisms of various cognitive and executive functions, such as visual attention, working memory, and decision-making. The training of behavioral tasks used to study these processes builds on reinforcement learning and involves many discrete stages. It may takes several months, but frequently lasts a year or longer. The training is usually based on applying a liquid reward as the reinforcer to strengthen the desired behavior, and absence of the reward if the animals response was wrong. We here propose an alternative, non-binary rewarding scheme that aims to minimize unrewarded behavior. We show the potential of this alternative scheme to significantly speed up the training of an animal at various stages, without trade-off in accessible task difficulty or task performance.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic sequencing approaches have become popular for the purpose of dissecting environmental microbial diversity, leading to the characterization of novel microbial lineages. In addition of bacterial and fungal genomes, metagenomic analysis can also reveal genomes of viruses that infect microbial cells. Because of their small genome size and limited knowledge of phage diversity, discovering novel phage sequences from metagenomic data is often challenging. Here we describe PhaMers (Phage k-Mers). a phage identification tool that uses supervised learning to classify metagenomic contigs as phage or non-phage on the basis of tetranucleotide frequencies. a technique that does not depend on existing gene annotations. PhaMers compares the tetranucleotide frequencies of metagenomic contigs to phage and bacteria references from online databases. resulting in assignments of lower level phage taxonomy based on sequence similarity. Using PhaMers. we identified 103 novel phage sequences from hot spring samples of Yellowstone National Park based on data generated from a microfluidic-based minimetagenomic approach. We analyzed assembled contigs over 5 kbp in length using PhaMers and compared the results with those generated by VirSorter, a publicly available phage identification and annotation package. We analyzed the performance of phage genome prediction and taxonomic classification using PhaMers. and presented putative hosts and taxa for some of the novel phage sequences. Finally. mini-metagenomic occurrence profiles of phage and prokaryotic genomes were used to verify putative hosts.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas are a heterogeneous group of brain tumors with distinct biological and clinical properties. Despite advances in surgical techniques and clinical regimens, treatment of high-grade glioma remains challenging and carries dismal rates of therapeutic success and overall survival. Challenges include the molecular complexity of gliomas, as well as inconsistencies in histopathological grading, resulting in an inaccurate prediction of disease progression and failure in the use of standard therapy. The updated 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the central nervous system reflects a refinement of tumor diagnostics by integrating the genotypic and phenotypic features, thereby narrowing the defined subgroups. The new classification recommends the molecular diagnosis of the IDH mutational status in gliomas. IDH-mutant gliomas manifest the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (G-CIMP). Notably, the recent identification of clinically relevant subsets of G-CIMP tumors (G-CIMP-high and G-CIMP-low) provide a further refinement in glioma classification that is independent of grade and histology. This scheme may be useful for predicting patient outcome and may be translated into effective therapeutic strategies tailored to each patient. In this review, we highlight the evolution of our understanding of the G-CIMP subsets and how recent advances in characterizing the genome and epigenome of gliomas may influence future basic and translational research.\\n\\nConflict of interestThe authors declare no conflict of interest",

However, a full characterisation of the genotype quality and association power for very low depth sequencing designs is still lacking.\\n\\nResultsWe perform cohort-wide whole genome sequencing (WGS) at low depth in 1,239 individuals (990 at 1x depth and 249 at 4x depth) from an isolated population, and establish a robust pipeline for calling and imputing very low depth WGS genotypes from standard bioinformatics tools. Using genotyping chip, whole-exome sequencing (WES, 75x depth) and high-depth (22x) WGS data in the same samples, we examine in detail the sensitivity of this approach, and show that imputed 1x WGS recapitulates 95.2% of variants found by imputed GWAS with an average minor allele concordance of 97% for common and low-frequency variants. In our study, 1x further allowed the discovery of 140,844 true low-frequency variants with 73% genotype concordance when compared to high-depth WGS data.

    "abstract": "We previously discovered that competition between fission yeast actin binding proteins (ABPs) for association with F-actin helps facilitate their sorting to different F-actin networks. Specifically, competition between actin patch ABPs fimbrin Fim1 and cofilin Adf1 enhances each others activities, and rapidly displaces tropomyosin Cdc8 from the F-actin network. However, these interactions dont explain how Fim1, a robust competitor, is prevented from associating equally well with other F-actin networks. Here, with a combination of fission yeast genetics, live cell fluorescent imaging, and in vitro TIRF microscopy, we identified the contractile ring ABP -actinin Ain1 as a key sorting factor. Fim1 competes with Ain1 for association with F-actin, which is dependent upon their residence time on F-actin. Remarkably, although Fim1 outcompetes both contractile ring ABPs Ain1 and Cdc8 individually, Cdc8 enhances the bundling activity of Ain1 10-fold, allowing the combination of Ain1 and Cdc8 to inhibit Fim1 association with contractile ring F-actin.",

To identify genomic regions associated with metabolic syndrome, a disorder of energy utilization and storage affecting several organ systems, we compared two Lyon rat strains, LH/Mav which is susceptible to MetS, and LL/Mav, which is susceptible to obesity as an intermediate MetS phenotype, with a third strain (LN/Mav) that is resistant to both MetS and obesity.

    "abstract": "Despite the critical roles RNA structures play in regulating gene expression, sequencing-based methods for experimentally determining RNA base pairs have remained inaccurate. Here, we describe a multidimensional chemical mapping method called M2-seq (mutate-and-map read out through next-generation sequencing) that takes advantage of sparsely mutated nucleotides to induce structural perturbations at partner nucleotides and then detects these events through dimethyl sulfate (DMS) probing and mutational profiling. In special cases, fortuitous errors introduced during DNA template preparation and RNA transcription are sufficient to give M2-seq helix signatures; these signals were previously overlooked or mistaken for correlated double DMS events. When mutations are enhanced through error-prone PCR, in vitro M2-seq experimentally resolves 33 of 68 helices in diverse structured RNAs including ribozyme domains, riboswitch aptamers, and viral RNA domains with a single false positive. These inferences do not require energy minimization algorithms and can be made by either direct visual inspection or by a new neural-net-inspired algorithm called M2-net. Measurements on the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena group I ribozyme embedded in Xenopus egg extract demonstrate the ability of M2-seq to detect RNA helices in a complex biological environment.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe intricate structures of RNA molecules are crucial to their biological functions but have been difficult to accurately characterize. Multidimensional chemical mapping methods improve accuracy but have so far involved painstaking experiments and reliance on secondary structure prediction software. A methodology called M2-seq now lifts these limitations. Mechanistic studies clarify the origin of serendipitous M2-seq-like signals that were recently discovered but not correctly explained and also provide mutational strategies that enable robust M2-seq for new RNA transcripts. The method detects dozens of Watson-Crick helices across diverse RNA folds in vitro and within frog egg extract, with low false positive rate (< 5%). M2-seq opens a route to unbiased discovery of RNA structures in vitro and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Summary StatementWe present a new image analysis technique using image velocimetry and spectral analysis that returns quantitative measures of gut contraction strength, frequency, and wave speed that can be used to study gut motility and other cellular movements.\\n\\nAbstractNormal gut function requires rhythmic and coordinated movements that are affected by developmental processes, physical and chemical stimuli, and many debilitating diseases. The imaging and characterization of gut motility, especially regarding periodic, propagative contractions driving material transport, are therefore critical goals. Whereas previous image analysis approaches have successfully extracted properties related to temporal frequency of motility modes, robust measures of contraction magnitude remain elusive. We developed a new image analysis method based on image velocimetry and spectral analysis that reveals temporal characteristics such as frequency and wave propagation speed, while also providing quantitative measures of the amplitude of gut motions. We validate this approach using several challenges to larval zebrafish, imaged with differential interference contrast microscopy. Both acetylcholine exposure and feeding increase frequency and amplitude of motility. Larvae lacking enteric nervous system gut innervation show the same average motility frequency, but reduced and less variable amplitude compared to wild-types. Our image analysis approach enables insights into gut dynamics in a wide variety of developmental and physiological contexts and can also be extended to analyze other types of cell movements.",

    "abstract": "Insects cause substantial losses to agricultural crops each year and require intensive management approaches. Genetic pest management (GPM) has emerged as a viable, non-chemical alternative for managing insect pests. The development of engineered gene drives for agricultural use is promising, though unproven, and has the potential to impact farmers as well as broader socio-ecological systems in several ways. Drawing on lessons from the deployment of other pest control technologies, this paper considers how gene drive insects could intersect with some of the complexities that characterize agricultural systems. The development of gene drives is emerging in a landscape of pest management shaped by past and current approaches, experiences, regulations, public opinion and pest invasions. Because gene drive insects may spread well beyond their release area, stakeholder groups at different spatial scales need to be engaged in decisions about their deployment. This new paradigm both complicates and offers great promise for future pest management efforts.",

The FrzCD binding to the nucleoid occur in a DNA-sequence independent manner and leads to the formation of multiple distributed clusters that explore constrained areas.

In vitro and in vivo experiments show that DNA-binding is not sequence-specific and is mediated by a basic aminoacid sequence of the FrzCD N-terminal domain.

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease is characterised by non-motor symptoms including sleep and circadian disruption, but the underlying aetiology is not well understood. Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGC) transmit light signals from the eye to brain areas controlling circadian rhythms and the pupil light reflex. Here we evaluate the hypothesis that these non-motor symptoms in people with Parkinsons disease may be linked to ipRGC dysfunction. Using chromatic pupillometry, we measured intrinsic (melanopsin-mediated) ipRGC and extrinsic (rod/cone photoreceptor-mediated) inputs to the pupil control pathway in a group of optimally medicated participants with a diagnosis of Parkinsons disease (PD, n = 17) compared to controls (n = 12). Autonomic tone was evaluated by measuring pupillary unrest in darkness. The PD participants underwent additional clinical assessments using the Unified Parkinsons disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&Y).\\n\\nCompared to controls, the PD group demonstrated an attenuated pupil constriction amplitude in response to long wavelength pulsed stimulation, and reduced post-illumination pupil response (PIPR) amplitude in response to both short wavelength pulsed and sinusoidal stimulation. In the PD group, PIPR amplitude did not correlate with measures of sleep quality, retinal nerve fibre layer thickness, UPDRS or H&Y score, or medication dosage. Both groups exhibited similar pupillary unrest in darkness.\\n\\nWe show that melanopsin and the rod/cone-photoreceptor contributions to the pupil control pathway are impaired in people with early-stage Parkinsons disease. Given that the deficits are independent of clinical assessment severity and are observed despite optimal medication, the melanopsin-mediated PIPR may be a biomarker for the detection of Parkinsons disease and its continued monitoring in both medicated and unmedicated individuals.",

    "abstract": "To study the effects of environmental endocrine disruptors (EEDs) on aquatic animals, embryos and larvae are typically incubated in water containing defined concentrations of EEDs. However, the amount of EED uptake into the animal is often difficult to determine. Using radiolabeled estradiol ([3H]E2), we previously developed a rapid, straightforward assay to measure estradiol uptake from water into zebrafish embryos and larvae. Here, we extend this approach to measure the uptake of two additional EEDs, bisphenol A (BPA) and ethinyl estradiol (EE2). As with E2, the uptake of each compound by individual larvae was low (< 6%), and increased with increasing concentration, duration, and developmental stage. We found that E2 and EE2 had similar uptake under equivalent exposure conditions, while BPA had comparatively lower uptake. One application of this assay is to test factors that influence EED uptake or efflux. It has been suggested that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) inhibit ABC transporters that may normally efflux EEDs and their metabolites, inducing toxicity in aquatic organisms. We measured [3H]E2 levels in zebrafish in the presence or absence of the POP PDBE-100, and cyclosporine A, a known inhibitor of ABC transporters. Neither chemical significantly affected [3H]E2 levels in zebrafish, suggesting that zebrafish maintain estradiol efflux in the presence of PDBE-100, independently of cyclosporine A-responsive transporters. These uptake results will be a valuable reference for EED exposure studies in developing zebrafish, and provide a rapid assay to screen for chemicals that influence estrogen-like EED levels in vivo.",

    "abstract": "We report the first DNA amplification chemistry with switch-like characteristics: the chemistry is biphasic, with an expected initial phase followed by an unprecedented high gain burst of product oligonucleotide in a second phase. The first and second phases are separated by a temporary plateau, with the second phase producing 10 to 100 times more product than the first. The reaction is initiated when an oligonucleotide binds and opens a palindromic looped DNA template with two binding domains. Upon loop opening, the oligonucleotide trigger is rapidly amplified through cyclic extension and nicking of the bound trigger. Loop opening and DNA association drive the amplification reaction, such that reaction acceleration in the second phase is correlated with DNA association thermodynamics. Without a palindromic sequence, the chemistry resembles the exponential amplification reaction (EXPAR). EXPAR terminates at the initial plateau, revealing a previously unknown phenomenon that causes early reaction cessation in this popular oligonucleotide amplification reaction. Here we present two distinct types of this biphasic reaction chemistry and propose dominant reaction pathways for each type based on thermodynamic arguments. These reactions create an endogenous switch-like output that reacts to approximately 1pM oligonucleotide trigger. The chemistry is isothermal and can be adapted to respond to a broad range of input target molecules such as proteins, genomic bacterial DNA, viral DNA, and microRNA. This rapid DNA amplification reaction could potentially impact a variety of disciplines such as synthetic biology, biosensors, DNA computing, and clinical diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Ribosome profiling is a powerful technique used to study translation at the genome-wide level, generating unique information concerning ribosome positions along RNAs. Optimal localization of ribosomes requires the proper identification of the ribosome P-site in each ribosome protected fragment, a crucial step to determine trinucleotide periodicity of translating ribosomes, and draw correct conclusions concerning where ribosomes are located. To determine the P-site within ribosome footprints at nucleotide resolution, the precise estimation of its offset with respect to the protected fragment is necessary. Here we present riboWaltz, an R package for calculation of optimal P-site offsets, diagnostic analysis and visual inspection of data. Compared to existing tools, riboWaltz shows improved accuracies for P-site estimation and neat ribosome positioning in multiple case studies.\\n\\nAvailability and ImplementationriboWaltz was implemented in R and is available at https://github.com/LabTranslationalArchitectomics/RiboWaltz\\n\\nContactgabriella.viero@cnr.it or fabio.lauria@unitn.it",

    "abstract": "Recent empirical evidence suggest that trade-off shapes can evolve, challenging the classical image of their high entrenchment. Here we model the evolution of the physiological mechanism that controls the allocation of a resource to two traits, by mutating the expression and the conformation of its constitutive hormones and receptors. We show that trade-off shapes do indeed evolve in this model through the combined action of genetic drift and selection, such that their evolutionarily expected curvature and length depend on context. In particular, a trade-offs shape should depend on the cost associated with the resource storage, itself depending on the traded resource and on the ecological context. Despite this convergence at the phenotypic level, we show that a variety of physiological mechanisms may evolve in similar simulations, suggesting redundancy at the genetic level. This model should provide a useful frame-work to interpret and link the overly complex observations of evolutionary endocrinology and evo-lutionary ecology.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination is essential for fertility and allelic shuffling. Canonical recombination models fail to capture the observed complexity of meiotic recombinants. Here we revisit these models by analyzing meiotic heteroduplex DNA tracts genome-wide in combination with meiotic DNA double-strand break (DSB) locations. We provide unprecedented support to the synthesis-dependent strand annealing model and establish estimates of its associated template switching frequency and polymerase processivity. We show that resolution of double Holliday junctions (dHJs) is biased toward cleavage of the pair of strands containing newly synthesized DNA near the junctions. The suspected dHJ resolvase Mlh1-3 as well as Mlh1-2, Exo1 and Sgs1 promote asymmetric positioning of crossover intermediates relative to the initiating DSB and bidirectional conversions. Finally, we show that crossover-biased dHJ resolution depends on Mlh1-3, Exo1, Msh5 and to a lesser extent on Sgs1. These properties are likely conserved in eukaryotes containing the ZMM proteins, which includes mammals.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive transcription generates many unstable non-coding transcripts in budding yeast. The transcription of such noncoding RNAs, in particular antisense RNAs (asRNAs), has been shown in a few examples to repress the expression of the associated mRNAs. Yet, such mechanism is not known to commonly contribute to the regulation of a given class of genes. Using a mutant context that stabilised pervasive transcripts, we observed that the least expressed mRNAs during the exponential phase were associated with high levels of asRNAs. These asRNAs also overlapped their corresponding gene promoters with a much higher frequency than average. Interrupting antisense transcription of a subset of genes corresponding to quiescence-enriched mRNAs restored their expression. The underlying mechanism acts in cis and involves several chromatin modifiers. Our results convey that transcription interference represses up to 30% of the 590 least expressed genes, which includes 163 genes with quiescence-enriched mRNAs. We also found that pervasive transcripts constitute a higher fraction of the transcriptome in quiescence relative to the exponential phase, consistent with gene expression itself playing an important role to suppress pervasive transcription. Accordingly, the HIS1 asRNA, normally only present in quiescence, is expressed in exponential phase upon HIS1 mRNA transcription interruption.",

    "abstract": "The formate hydrogenlyase (FHL) complex of Escherichia coli is normally produced under anaerobic fermentative conditions when its physiological role is to oxidise formate to carbon dioxide and couple that reaction directly to the reduction of protons to molecular hydrogen. This forward reaction is the major route of hydrogen production by E. coli and the physiology, genetics and biochemistry of this process are reasonably well understood. However, studies of the reverse reaction - hydrogen-dependent carbon dioxide reduction - have been rather less extensive. Harnessing the alternative reverse reaction has the potential to unlock FHL as a carbon dioxide cycling enzyme, or could potentially lead to the development of bio-based carbon capture technologies. In this work, it is established that FHL can operate as a highly efficient CO2 reductase. A controllable pressure system was designed with the intention of maximising substrate availability to the FHL enzyme. By placing gaseous CO2 and H2 are under pressure (up to 10 bar), and by using a compartmentalised intact whole cell approach where the produced formate is excreted, the optimised experimental system was observed to convert 100 % of gaseous CO2 to formic acid and generate >500 mM formate in solution at an initial rate of 1.2 g formate per litre per hour.",

    "abstract": "Older adults often experience difficulties in understanding speech, partly because of age-related hearing loss. In young adults, activity of the left articulatory motor cortex is enhanced and it interacts with the auditory cortex via the left-hemispheric dorsal stream during speech processing. Little is known about the effect of ageing and age-related hearing loss on this auditory-motor interaction and speech processing in the articulatory motor cortex. It has been proposed that up-regulation of the motor system during speech processing could compensate for hearing loss and auditory processing deficits in older adults. Alternatively, age-related auditory deficits could reduce and distort the input from the auditory cortex to the articulatory motor cortex, suppressing recruitment of the motor system during listening to speech. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of ageing and age-related hearing loss on the excitability of the tongue motor cortex during listening to spoken sentences using transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography. Our results show that the excitability of the tongue motor cortex was facilitated during listening to speech in young and older adults with normal hearing. This facilitation was significantly reduced in older adults with hearing loss. These findings suggest a decline of auditory-motor processing of speech in adults with age-related hearing loss.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) has become a major fMRI method to study network organization of human brains. There has been recent interest in the temporal fluctuations of FC calculated using short time windows (\\\"dynamic FC\\\") because this method could provide information inaccessible with conventional \\\"static\\\" FC, which is typically calculated using the entire scan lasting several tens of minutes. Although multiple studies have revealed considerable temporal fluctuations in FC, it is still unclear whether the fluctuations of FC measured in hemodynamics reflect the dynamics of underlying neural activity. We addressed this question using simultaneous imaging of neuronal calcium and hemodynamic signals in mice and found coordinated temporal dynamics of calcium FC and hemodynamic FC measured in the same short time windows. Moreover, we found that variation in transient neuronal coactivation patterns (CAPs) was significantly related to temporal fluctuations of sliding window FC in hemodynamics. Finally, we show that the observed dynamics of FC cannot be fully accounted for by simulated data assuming stationary FC. These results provide evidence for the neuronal origin of dynamic FC and further suggest that information relevant to FC is condensed in temporally sparse events that can be extracted using a small number of time points.",

    "abstract": "In all chromosome conformation capture based experiments the accuracy with which contacts are detected varies considerably because of the uneven distribution of restriction sites along genomes. In addition, repeated sequences as well as homologous, large identical regions remain invisible to the assay because of the ambiguities they introduce during the alignment of the sequencing reads along the genome. As a result, the investigation of homologs during meiosis prophase through 3C studies has been limited. Here, we redesigned and reassembled in yeast a 145kb region with regularly spaced restriction sites for various enzymes. Thanks to this Syn-3C design, we enhanced the signal to noise ratio and improved the visibility of the entire region. We also improved our understanding of Hi-C data and definition of resolution. The redesigned sequence is now distinguishable from its native homologous counterpart in an isogenic diploid strain. As a proof of principle, we track the establishment of homolog pairing during meiotic prophase in a synchronized population. This provides new insights on the individualization and pairing of homologs, as well as on their internal restructuration into arrays of loops during meiosis prophase. Overall, we show the interest of redesigned genomic regions to explore complex biological questions otherwise difficult to address.",

Modeling infectious disease dynamics through contact networks is sometimes challenging, however, due to a limited understanding of pathogen transmission routes and infectivity. We developed a novel tool, INoDS (Identifying Network models of infectious Disease Spread) that estimates the predictive power of empirical contact networks to explain observed patterns of infectious disease spread. We show that our method is robust to partially sampled contact networks, incomplete disease information, and enables hypothesis testing on transmission mechanisms. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in two host-pathogen systems: Crithidia bombi in bumble bee colonies and Salmonella in wild Australian sleepy lizard populations. The performance of INoDS in synthetic and complex empirical systems highlights its role in identifying transmission pathways of novel or neglected pathogens, as an alternative approach to laboratory transmission experiments, and overcoming common data-collection constraints.",
