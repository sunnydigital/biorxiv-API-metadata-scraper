    "abstract": "Many R packages have been developed for transcriptome analysis but their use often requires familiarity with R and integrating results of different packages is difficult. Here we present PIVOT, an R-based application with a uniform user interface and graphical data management that allows non-programmers to conveniently access various bioinformatics tools and interactively explore transcriptomics data. PIVOT supports many popular open source packages for transcriptome analysis and provides an extensive set of tools for statistical data manipulations. A graph-based visual interface is used to represent the links between derived datasets, allowing easy tracking of data versions. PIVOT further supports automatic report generation, publication-quality plots, and program/data state saving, such that all analysis can be saved, shared and reproduced.",

    "abstract": "Draining 31 states and roughly 3 million km2, the Mississippi River (MSR) and its tributaries constitute an essential resource to millions of people for clean drinking water, transportation, agriculture, and industry. Since the turn of the 20th century, MSR water quality has continually rated poorly due to human activity. Acting as first responders, microorganisms can mitigate, exacerbate, and/or serve as predictors for water quality, yet we know little about their community structure or ecology at the whole river scale for large rivers. We collected both biological (16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicons) and physicochemical data from 38 MSR sites over nearly 3000 km from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico. Our results revealed a microbial community composed of similar taxa to other rivers but with unique trends in the relative abundance patterns among phyla, OTUs, and the core microbiome. Furthermore, we observed a separation in microbial communities that mirrored the transition from an 8th to 10th Strahler order river at the Missouri River confluence, marking a different start to the lower MSR than the historical distinction at the Ohio River confluence in Cairo, IL. Within MSR microbial assemblages we identified subgroups of OTUs from the phyla Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Oomycetes, and Heterokonts that were associated with, and predictive of, the important eutrophication nutrients nitrate and phosphate. This study offers the most comprehensive view of MSR microbiota to date, provides important groundwork for higher resolution microbial studies of river perturbation, and identifies potential microbial indicators of river health related to eutrophication.",

Reproductive interference is considered a strong ecological force, potentially leading to species exclusion. This supposes that the net effect of reproductive interactions is strongly negative for one of the species involved. Testing this requires a comprehensive analysis of interspecific reproductive interactions, accounting for the order and timing of mating events, and for their effects on either fertility or fecundity. To this aim, we measured reproductive interactions between a focal species, Tetranychus urticae, and an invasive (T.evansi) and a resident (T. ludeni) species, varying the mating sequence and interval, and measuring the effect of such crosses on fecundity and offspring sex ratio (a measure of fertility, as these species are haplodiploid). We found that mating with heterospecifics affected fecundity and sex ratio negatively, but also positively, depending on the species involved, and on the order and timing of mating events. Overall, the net effect of reproductive interactions was weak despite strong effects of particular events. In natural situations, the outcome of reproductive interactions will thus hinge upon the frequency of each event.",

We investigated changes in markers of ribosome biogenesis, a process linked with skeletal muscle hypertrophy, following concurrent training versus RT alone. Twenty-three males underwent eight weeks of RT, either performed alone (RT group, n = 8), or combined with either high-intensity interval training (HIT+RT group, n = 8), or moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT+RT group, n = 7). Muscle samples (vastus lateralis) were obtained before training, and immediately before, 1 h and 3 h after the final training session. Training-induced changes in basal expression of the 45S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) precursor (45S pre-rRNA), and 5.8S and 28S mature rRNAs, were greater with concurrent training versus RT. However, during the final training session, RT further increased both mTORC1 (p70S6K1 and rps6 phosphorylation) and 45S pre-rRNA transcription-related signalling (TIF-1A and UBF phosphorylation) versus concurrent training. These data suggest that when performed in a training-accustomed state, RT induces further increases mTORC1 and ribosome biogenesis related signalling in human skeletal muscle versus concurrent training; however, changes in ribosome biogenesis markers were more favourable following a period of short-term concurrent training versus RT performed alone.",

    "abstract": "Excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the mammalian sensory cortex form interconnected circuits that control cortical stimulus selectivity and sensory acuity. Theoretical studies have predicted that suppression of inhibition in such excitatory-inhibitory networks can lead to either an increase or, paradoxically, a decrease in excitatory neuronal firing, with consequent effects on stimulus selectivity. We tested whether modulation of inhibition or excitation in the auditory cortex could evoke such a variety of effects in tone-evoked responses and in behavioral frequency discrimination acuity. We found that, indeed, the effects of optogenetic manipulation on stimulus selectivity and behavior varied in both magnitude and sign across subjects, possibly reflecting differences in circuitry or expression of optogenetic factors. Changes in neural population responses consistently predicted behavioral changes for individuals separately, including improvement and impairment in acuity. This correlation between cortical and behavioral change demonstrates that, despite complex and varied effects these manipulations can have on neuronal dynamics, the resulting changes in cortical activity account for accompanying changes in behavioral acuity.\\n\\nAuthor summaryExcitatory and inhibitory interactions determine stimulus specificity and tuning in sensory cortex, thereby controlling perceptual discrimination acuity. Modeling of such excitatory-inhibitory circuits has predicted that suppressing the activity of inhibitory neurons can lead to increases or, paradoxically, decreases in excitatory activity, depending on the architecture and modulation parameters of the inhibitory component of the network. Here, we capitalized on differences between subjects to test whether suppressing/activating inhibition and excitation across a range of parameters in sensory cortex can in fact exhibit such paradoxical effects for both stimulus sensitivity and behavioral discriminability. Indeed, we found that the same optogenetic manipulation in the auditory cortices of different mice could improve or impair frequency discrimination acuity, in a fashion that was predictable from the effects on cortical responses to tones. The same manipulations sometimes produced opposite changes in the behavior of different individuals, supporting theoretical predictions for inhibition-stabilized networks.",

    "abstract": "Potato virus Y is the most economically important potato viral pathogen. We aimed at unraveling the roles of small RNAs (sRNAs) in the complex immune signaling network controlling the establishment of tolerant response of potato cv. Desiree to the virus. We constructed a sRNA regulatory network connecting sRNAs and their targets to link sRNA level responses to physiological processes. We discovered an interesting novel sRNAs-gibberellin regulatory circuit being activated as early as 3 days post inoculation before viral multiplication can be detected. Increased levels of miR167 and phasiRNA931 were reflected in decreased levels of transcripts involved in gibberellin biosynthesis. Moreover, decreased concentration of gibberellin confirmed this regulation. The functional relation between lower activity of gibberellin signaling and reduced disease severity was previously confirmed in Arabidopsis-virus interaction using knockout mutants. We further showed that this regulation is salicylic acid-dependent as the response of sRNA network was attenuated in salicylic acid-depleted transgenic counterpart NahG-Desiree expressing severe disease symptoms. Besides downregulation of gibberellin signaling, regulation of several other parts of sRNA network in tolerant Desiree revealed similarities to responses observed in mutualistic symbiotic interactions. The intertwining of different regulatory networks revealed shows how developmental signaling, disease symptom development and stress signaling can be balanced.",

    "abstract": "Almost twenty years after the completion of the C. elegans genome sequence, gene structure annotation is still an ongoing process with new evidence for gene variants still being regularly uncovered by additional in-depth transcriptome studies. While alternative splice forms can allow a single gene to encode several functional isoforms the question of how much spurious splicing is tolerated is still heavily debated.\\n\\nHere we gathered a compendium of 1,682 publicly available C. elegans RNA-seq datasets to increase the dynamic range of detection of RNA isoforms and obtained robust measurements of the relative abundance of each splicing event. While most of the splicing reads come from reproducibly detected splicing events, a large fraction of purported junctions are only supported by a very low number of reads. We devised an automated curation method that takes into account the expression level of each gene to discriminate robust splicing events from potential biological noise. We found that rarely used splice sites disproportionately come from highly expressed genes and are significantly less conserved in other nematode genomes than splice sites with a higher usage frequency.\\n\\nOur increased detection power confirmed trans-splicing for at least 84% of C. elegans protein coding genes. The genes for which trans-splicing was not observed are overwhelmingly low expression genes, suggesting that the mechanism is pervasive but not full captured by organism-wide RNA-Seq.\\n\\nWe generated annotated gene models including quantitative exon usage information for the entire C. elegans genome.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDTargeted therapies specifically act by blocking the activity of proteins that are encoded by genes critical for tumorigenesis. However, most cancers acquire resistance and long-term disease remission is rarely observed. Understanding the time course of molecular changes responsible for the development of acquired resistance could enable optimization of patients treatment options. Clinically, acquired therapeutic resistance can only be studied at a single time point in resistant tumors. To determine the dynamics of these molecular changes, we obtained high throughput omics data weekly during the development of cetuximab resistance in a head and neck cancer in vitro model.\\n\\nRESULTSAn unsupervised algorithm, CoGAPS, was used to quantify the evolving transcriptional and epigenetic changes. Applying a PatternMarker statistic to the results from CoGAPS enabled novel heatmap-based visualization of the dynamics in these time course omics data. We demonstrate that transcriptional changes result from immediate therapeutic response or resistance, whereas epigenetic alterations only occur with resistance. Integrated analysis demonstrates delayed onset of changes in DNA methylation relative to transcription, suggesting that resistance is stabilized epigenetically.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSGenes with epigenetic alterations associated with resistance that have concordant expression changes are hypothesized to stabilize resistance. These genes include FGFR1, which was associated with EGFR inhibitor resistance previously. Thus, integrated omics analysis distinguishes the timing of molecular drivers of resistance. Our findings provide a relevant towards better understanding of the time course progression of changes resulting in acquired resistance to targeted therapies. This is an important contribution to the development of alternative treatment strategies that would introduce new drugs before the resistant phenotype develops.",

One potential evolutionary driver of programmed aging is selection pressure from parasites and other infectious organisms. While selection pressure from parasites and other infectious organisms have long been considered by many biologists to have led to the evolution of sexual reproduction, it has only rarely been considered as a potential driver for evolution of aging, a biological process that likely evolved contemporaneously with sexual reproduction. Here I describe stochastic simulations of host and parasite populations with senescence as an independent variable. The results show that populations with more rapid senescence bear lower parasite loads and oscillate more quickly through alternate phenotypes with differential resistance against parasites.

    "abstract": "The left and right rodent hippocampi exhibit striking lateralization in some of the very neural substrates considered to be critical for hippocampal cognitive function. Despite this, there is an overwhelming lack of consideration for hemispheric differences in studies of the rodent hippocampus. Asymmetries identified so far suggest that a bilateral model of the hippocampus will be essential for an understanding of this brain region, and perhaps of the brain more widely. Although hypotheses have been proposed to explain how the left and right hippocampi contribute to behavior and cognition, these hypotheses have either been refuted by more recent studies or have been limited in the scope of data they explain. Here, I will first review data on human and rodent hippocampal lateralization. The implications of these data suggest that considering the hippocampus as a bilateral structure with functional lateralization will be critical moving forward in understanding the function and mechanisms of this brain region. In exploring these implications, I will then propose a hypothesis of the hippocampus as a bilateral structure. This discrete-continuous (DC) hypothesis proposes that the left and right hippocampi contribute to spatial memory and navigation in a complementary manner. Specifically, the left hemisphere stores spatial information as discrete, salient locations and that the right hemisphere represents space continuously, contributing to route computation and flexible spatial navigation. Consideration of hippocampal lateralization in designing future studies may provide insight into the function of the hippocampus and resolve debates concerning its function.",

    "abstract": "For many neural network models in which neurons are trained to classify inputs like perceptrons, the number of inputs that can be classified is limited by the connectivity of each neuron, even when the total number of neurons is very large. This poses the problem of how the biological brain can take advantage of its huge number of neurons given that the connectivity is sparse. One solution is to combine multiple perceptrons together, as in committee machines. The number of classifiable random patterns would then grow linearly with the number of perceptrons, even when each perceptron has limited connectivity. However, the problem is moved to the downstream readout neurons, which would need a number of connections that is as large as the number of perceptrons. Here we propose a different approach in which the readout is implemented by connecting multiple perceptrons in a recurrent attractor neural network. We prove analytically that the number of classifiable random patterns can grow unboundedly with the number of perceptrons, even when the connectivity of each perceptron remains finite. Most importantly, both the recurrent connectivity and the connectivity of downstream readouts also remain finite. Our study shows that feed-forward neural classifiers with numerous long range afferent connections can be replaced by recurrent networks with sparse long range connectivity without sacrificing the classification performance. Our strategy could be used to design more general scalable network architectures with limited connectivity, which resemble more closely the brain neural circuits which are dominated by recurrent connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how nervous systems exploit task relevant properties of sensory stimuli to perform natural tasks is fundamental to the study of perceptual systems. However, there are few formal methods for determining which stimulus properties are most useful for a given task. As a consequence, it is difficult to develop principled models for how to compute task-relevant latent variables from natural signals, and it is difficult to evaluate descriptive models fit to neural response. Accuracy Maxmization Analysis (AMA) is a recently developed Bayesian method for finding the optimal task-specific filters (receptive fields). Here, we introduce AMA-Gauss, a new faster form of AMA that incorporates the assumption that the class-conditional filter responses are Gaussian distributed. Next, we use AMA-Gauss to show that its assumptions are justified for two fundamental visual tasks: retinal speed estimation and binocular disparity estimation. Then, we show that AMA-Gauss has striking formal similarities to popular quadratic models of neural response: the energy model and the Generalized Quadratic Model (GQM).

    "abstract": "Genome-wide analysis of chromatin accessibility in primary tissues has uncovered millions of candidate regulatory sequences in the human and mouse genomes1-4. However, the heterogeneity of biological samples used in previous studies has prevented a precise understanding of the dynamic chromatin landscape in specific cell types. Here, we show that analysis of the transposase-accessible-chromatin in single nuclei isolated from frozen tissue samples can resolve cellular heterogeneity and delineate transcriptional regulatory sequences in the constituent cell types. Our strategy is based on a combinatorial barcoding assisted single cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin5 and is optimized for nuclei from flash-frozen primary tissue samples (snATAC-seq). We used this method to examine the mouse forebrain at seven development stages and in adults. From snATAC-seq profiles of more than 15,000 high quality nuclei, we identify 20 distinct cell populations corresponding to major neuronal and non-neuronal cell-types in foetal and adult forebrains. We further define cell-type specific cis regulatory sequences and infer potential master transcriptional regulators of each cell population. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a general approach for identifying cell-type-specific cis regulatory sequences in heterogeneous tissue samples, and provide a rich resource for understanding forebrain development in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in research on gene drives have produced genetic constructs that could theoretically spread a desired gene (payload) into all populations of a species, with a single release in one place. This attribute has advantages, but also comes with risks and ethical concerns. There has been a call for research on gene drive systems that are spatially and/or temporally self-limiting. Here we use a population genetics model to compare the expected characteristics of three spatially self-limiting gene drive systems: one-locus underdominance, two-locus underdominance, and daisy-chain drives. We find large differences between these gene drives in the minimum release size required for successfully driving a payload into a population. The daisy-chain system is the most efficient, requiring the smallest release, followed by the two-locus underdominance system, and then the one-locus underdominance system. However, when the target population exchanges migrants with a non-target population, the gene drives requiring smaller releases suffer from higher risks of unintended spread. For payloads that incur relatively low fitness costs (up to 30%), a simple daisy-chain drive is practically incapable of remaining localized, even with migration rates as low as 0.5% per generation. The two-locus underdominance system can achieve localized spread under a broader range of migration rates and of payload fitness costs, while the one-locus underdominance system largely remains localized. We also find differences in the extent of population alteration and in the permanence of the alteration achieved by the three gene drives. The two-locus underdominance system does not always spread the payload to fixation, even after successful drive, while the daisy-chain system can, for a small set of parameter values, achieve a temporally-limited spread of the payload. These differences could affect the suitability of each gene drive for specific applications.

    "abstract": "Phenomics is an emerging branch of modern biology that uses high throughput phenotyping tools to capture multiple environmental and phenotypic traits, often at massive spatial and temporal scales. The resulting high dimensional data represent a treasure trove of information for providing an in-depth understanding of how multiple factors interact and contribute to the overall growth and behavior of different genotypes. However, computational tools that can parse through such complex data and aid in extracting plausible hypotheses are currently lacking. In this paper, we present Hyppo-X, a new algorithmic approach to visually explore complex phenomics data and in the process characterize the role of environment on phenotypic traits. We model the problem as one of unsupervised structure discovery, and use emerging principles from algebraic topology and graph theory for discovering higher-order structures of complex phenomics data. We present an open source software which has interactive visualization capabilities to facilitate data navigation and hypothesis formulation. We test and evaluate Hyppo-X on two real-world plant (maize) data sets. Our results demonstrate the ability of our approach to delineate divergent subpopulation-level behavior. Notably, our approach shows how environmental factors could influence phenotypic behavior, and how that effect varies across different genotypes and different time scales. To the best of our knowledge, this effort provides one of the first approaches to systematically formalize the problem of hypothesis extraction for phenomics data. Considering the infancy of the phenomics field, tools that help users explore complex data and extract plausible hypotheses in a data-guided manner will be critical to future advancements in the use of such data.",

Computational techniques have arisen from areas such as single-cell  omics and in cancer modelling where pseudotime can be used to learn about cellular differentiation or tumour progression. However, methods to date typically assume homogenous genetic and environmental backgrounds, which becomes particularly limiting as datasets grow in size and complexity. As a solution to this we describe a novel statistical framework that learns pseudotime trajectories in the presence of non-homogeneous genetic, phenotypic, or environmental backgrounds. We demonstrate that this enables us to identify interactions between such factors and the underlying genomic trajectory. By applying this model to both single-cell gene expression data and population level cancer studies we show that it uncovers known and novel interaction effects between genetic and enironmental factors and the expression of genes in pathways.

    "abstract": "Drug resistance is the single most important driver of cancer treatment failure for modern targeted therapies. This resistance may be due to the presence of dormant or aggressive tumor cell phenotypes or to context-driven protection. Non-malignant cells and other factors, constituting the microenvironment in which the tumor grows (the stroma), are now thought to play a crucial role in both therapeutic response and resistance. Specifically, the dialogue between the tumor and stroma has been shown to modulate the response to molecularly targeted therapies, through proliferative and survival signaling. The goal of this work is to investigate interactions between a growing tumor and its surrounding stroma in facilitating the emergence of drug resistance. We use mathematical modeling as a theoretical framework to bridge between experimental models and scales, with the aim of separating the intrinsic and extrinsic components of resistance in BRAF mutated melanoma. The model describes tumor-stroma dynamics both with and without treatment. Calibration of our model, through the integration of experimental data, revealed significant variation across animal replicates in either the intensity of stromal promotion or intrinsic tissue carrying capacity. Furthermore our study highlights the need to account for this variation in the design of treatment strategies. Major Findings. Through the integration of a simple mathematical model with in vitro and in vivo experimental growth dynamics of melanoma cell lines (both with and without drug), we were able to dissect the relative contributions of intrinsic versus environmental resistance. Our study revealed significant heterogeneity in vivo, indicating that there is a diversity of either stromal promotion or tumor carrying capacity under targeted therapy. We believe this variation may be one possible explanation for the heterogeneity observed across patients and within individual patients with multiple metastases. Therefore, quantifying this variation both within in vivo model systems and in individual patients could have a significant impact on the design of future treatment strategies that target both the tumor and stroma. Further, we present guidelines for building more effective and longer lasting therapeutic strategies utilizing our experimentally calibrated model. These strategies explicitly consider the protective nature of the stroma and utilize inhibitors that modulate it.\\n\\nPrecisQuantification of the environmental contribution to drug resistance reveals heterogeneity that significantly alters treatment dynamics that can be exploited for therapeutic gain.\\n\\nFinancial SupportPicco and Anderson: US National Cancer Institute grant U01CA151924.\\n\\nPicco: UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC grant number EP/G037280/1).\\n\\nConflict of Interest DisclosureThe authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.",

    "abstract": "Structured AbstractPurpose: Subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex are tumor suppressors inactivated in [~]20% of all cancers. Yet, few targeted treatments for SWI/SNF-mutant cancers exist. Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a rare, aggressive ovarian cancer in young women that is universally driven by loss of the SWI/SNF ATPase subunits, SMARCA4 and SMARCA2. Given poor two-year survival rates for these women, a great need exists for effective targeted therapies.\\n\\nExperimental Design: To identify underlying therapeutic vulnerabilities in SCCOHT, we conducted high-throughput siRNA and drug screens. Complementary proteomics approaches comprehensively profiled kinases inhibited by ponatinib. Ponatinib was tested for efficacy in two PDX models and one cell line xenograft model of SCCOHT.\\n\\nResults: FGFRs and PDGFRs were overlapping hits between screens and the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family was enriched in the siRNA screen hits. Evaluation of eleven RTK inhibitors in three SCCOHT cell lines identified ponatinib, an inhibitor of multiple RTKs, as the most effective clinically approved agent. Proteomics approaches confirmed inhibition of known targets of ponatinib and more than 20 non-canonical ponatinib targets. Ponatinib also delayed tumor doubling time 4-fold in SCCOHT-1 xenografts and reducing final tumor volumes in two SCCOHT patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models by 58.6% and 42.5%.\\n\\nConclusion: Ponatinib is an effective agent for SCCOHT in both in vitro and in vivo preclinical models through its inhibition of multiple kinases. Clinical investigation of this FDA-approved oncology drug in SCCOHT is warranted.\\n\\nAdditional InformationThis work was supported by research funds from the Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute 34 (#703458, D.G.H.), the National Institutes of Health (R01 CA195670-01, B.E.W., D.G.H., and 35 J.M.T., and T32 HL007106-39 to E.M.C), the Terry Fox Research Institute Initiative New Frontiers Program in Cancer (#1021, D.G.H.), the British Columbia Cancer Foundation (D.G.H.), the VGH & UBC Foundation (D.G.H.), the Anne Rita Monahan Foundation (P.R.), the Marsha Rivkin Center for Ovarian Cancer Research (J.M.T.), the Ovarian Cancer Alliance of Arizona (J.M.T.), the Small Cell Ovarian Cancer Foundation (P.R., J.D.L., B.V., and J.M.T.), and philanthropic support to the TGen Foundation (J.M.T.).\\n\\nCOI disclosure statement: The authors declare no potential conflicts of interest.",

The crustacean carapace is a novelty that evolved in the early Cambrian. In an extant crustacean, Daphnia magna, the carapace grows from the body wall as a double-layered sheet with a specialized margin. We show that the growing margin of this carapace expresses vestigial, scalloped and wingless, genes that are known to play key roles in regulating growth at the insect wing margin. RNAi-mediated knockdown of scalloped and wingless impair carapace development, indicating that carapace and wing might share a common mechanism for margin outgrowth. However, carapace and wings arise in different parts of the body and their margins have different orientations, arguing that these structures have independent evolutionary origins. We show that scalloped is also expressed at the margin of unrelated flat outgrowths (tergites and coxal plates) in the distantly related crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis. Based on these observations, we propose that the vestigial-scalloped-wingless gene module has a common role in the margin of diverse flat structures, originating before the divergence of major crustacean lineages and the emergence of insects. Repeated co-option of this module occurred independently in the carapace, wing and other flat outgrowths, underpinning the evolution of distinct novelties in different arthropod lineages.",

    "abstract": "The spread of maternally inherited microorganisms, such as Wolbachia bacteria, can induce indirect selective sweeps on host mitochondria, to which they are linked within the cytoplasm. The resulting reduction in effective population size might lead to smaller mitochondrial diversity and reduced efficiency of natural selection. Although suggested by a few case studies, the global consequences of this process on mitochondrial diversity and evolution remains to be assessed. Here we address this question using a mapping of Wolbachia acquisition / extinction events on a large mitochondrial DNA tree, including over 1,000 species. We show that the presence of Wolbachia is associated with a twofold reduction in silent mitochondrial polymorphism, and a 13% increase in non-synonymous substitution rates. These findings validate the conjecture that the widespread distribution of Wolbachia infections throughout arthropods impacts the effective population size of mitochondria. These effects might in part explain the disconnection between genetic diversity and demographic population size in mitochondria, and also fuel red-queen-like cytonuclear coevolution through the fixation of deleterious mitochondrial alleles.",

Crossovers resulting from the repair of meiotic breaks are essential for proper chromosome segregation and increase genetic diversity of the progeny. However, mechanisms regulating CO formation remain elusive. Here, we identified through protein-protein interaction and genetic screens FIDGETIN-LIKE-1 INTERACTING PROTEIN (FLIP) as a new partner of the previously characterized anti-crossover factor FIDGETIN-LIKE-1 (FIGL1) in Arabidopsis thaliana. We showed that FLIP limits meiotic crossover together with FIGL1. Further, FLIP and FIGL1 form a protein complex conserved from Arabidopsis to Human. FIGL1 interacts with the recombinases RAD51 and DMC1, the enzymes that catalyze the DNA stand exchange step of homologous recombination. Arabidopsis flip mutants recapitulates the figl1 phenotype, with enhanced meiotic recombination associated with change in DMC1 dynamics. Our data thus suggest that FLIP and FIGL1 form a conserved complex that regulates the crucial step of strand invasion in homologous recombination.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis homologous chromosomes undergo reciprocal crossovers, which generate genetic diversity and underpin classical crop improvement. Meiotic recombination initiates from DNA double strand breaks, which are processed into single-stranded DNA that can invade a homologous chromosome. The resulting joint molecules can ultimately be resolved as crossovers. In Arabidopsis, competing pathways balance the repair of [~]100-200 meiotic DSBs into [~]10 crossovers per meiosis, with the excess DSBs repaired as non-crossovers. In order to bias DSB repair towards crossovers, we simultaneously increased dosage of the pro-crossover E3 ligase gene HEI10 and introduced mutations in the anti-crossover helicase genes RECQ4A and RECQ4B. As HEI10 and recq4a recq4b increase interfering and non-interfering crossover pathways respectively, they combine additively to yield a massive meiotic recombination increase. Interestingly, we also show that increased HEI10 dosage increases crossover coincidence, which indicates an effect of HEI10 on interference. We also show that patterns of interhomolog polymorphism and heterochromatin drive recombination increases towards the sub-telomeres in both HEI10 and recq4a recq4b backgrounds, while the centromeres remain crossover-suppressed. These results provide a genetic framework for engineering meiotic recombination landscapes in plant genomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe molecular mechanisms underlying bacterial cell death due to stresses or bactericidal antibiotics are complex and remain puzzling. Previously, it was shown that iron is required for effective killing of bacterial cells by numerous bactericidal antibiotics. Here, our high-resolution Tn-seq analysis demonstrated that transposon mutants of S. Typhimurium with insertions in essential genes escaped immediate killing or growth inhibition under iron-restricted conditions for approximately one-third of all essential genes.\\n\\nResultsWe grouped essential genes into two categories, iron-dependent and iron-independent essential genes. The iron-dependency of the iron-dependent essential genes was further validated by the fact that the relative abundance of these essential gene mutants increased further with more severe iron restrictions. Our unexpected observation can be explained well by the recently proposed common killing mechanisms of bactericidal antibiotics via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this model iron restriction would inhibit production of ROS, leading to reduced killing activity following blocking of an essential function. Interestingly, the targets of most antibiotics currently in use clinically, whether bacteriostatic or bactericidal, are iron-dependent essential genes.\\n\\nConclusionsOur result suggests that targeting iron-independent essential genes may be a better strategy for future antibiotic development, because blocking these genes would lead to immediate cell death regardless of iron concentration. On the contrary, blocking iron-dependent pathways under iron limited in vivo environment could lead to reduced killing action, which might increase drug-resistance by mutagenic action of sublethal concentrations of ROS. This work expands our knowledge on the role of iron to a broader range of essential pathways, and provides novel insights for development of more effective antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "We address the issue of reliably detecting and quantifying cross-frequency coupling (CFC) in neural time series. Based on non-linear auto-regressive models, the proposed method provides a generative and parametric model of the time-varying spectral content of the signals. As this method models the entire spectrum simultaneously, it avoids the pitfalls related to incorrect filtering or the use of the Hilbert transform on wide-band signals. As the model is probabilistic, it also provides a score of the model \\\"goodness of fit\\\" via the likelihood, enabling easy and legitimate model selection and parameter comparison; this data-driven feature is unique to our model-based approach. Using three datasets obtained with invasive neurophysiological recordings in humans and rodents, we demonstrate that these models are able to replicate previous results obtained with other metrics, but also reveal new insights such as the influence of the amplitude of the slow oscillation. Using simulations, we demonstrate that our parametric method can reveal neural couplings with shorter signals than non-parametric methods. We also show how the likelihood can be used to find optimal filtering parameters, suggesting new properties on the spectrum of the driving signal, but also to estimate the optimal delay between the coupled signals, enabling a directionality estimation in the coupling.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryNeural oscillations synchronize information across brain areas at various anatomical and temporal scales. Of particular relevance, slow fluctuations of brain activity have been shown to affect high frequency neural activity, by regulating the excitability level of neural populations. Such cross-frequency-coupling can take several forms. In the most frequently observed type, the power of high frequency activity is time-locked to a specific phase of slow frequency oscillations, yielding phase-amplitude-coupling (PAC). Even when readily observed in neural recordings, such non-linear coupling is particularly challenging to formally characterize. Typically, neuroscientists use band-pass filtering and Hilbert transforms with ad-hoc correlations. Here, we explicitly address current limitations and propose an alternative probabilistic signal modeling approach, for which statistical inference is fast and well-posed. To statistically model PAC, we propose to use non-linear auto-regressive models which estimate the spectral modulation of a signal conditionally to a driving signal. This conditional spectral analysis enables easy model selection and clear hypothesis-testing by using the likelihood of a given model. We demonstrate the advantage of the model-based approach on three datasets acquired in rats and in humans. We further provide novel neuroscientific insights on previously reported PAC phenomena, capturing two mechanisms in PAC: influence of amplitude and directionality estimation.",

    "abstract": "Raffinose family oligosacharrides (RFOs) accumulate under stress conditions in many plants and have been suggested to act as stress protectants. To elucidate the metabolic process of RFOs under cold stress, levels of RFOs and relative carbohydrates, the expression and activities of main metabolic enzymes and their subcellular compartments were investigated during low temperature treatment and recovery period in cucumber leaves. Cold stress induced the accumulation of stachyose in vacuoles, galactinol in vacuoles and cytosols, and sucrose and raffinose in vacuoles, cytosols and chloroplasts. After cold stress removal, levels of these sugars decreased gradually in respective compartments. Among 4 galactinol synthase genes (CsGS), CsGS1 was not affected by the cold stress, while other three CsGSs were up-regulated by the low temperature. RNA levels of acid--galactosidase (GAL) 3, alkaline--galactosidase (AGA) 2 and 3, and the activities of GAL and AGA were up-regulated after cold stress removal. The GAL3 protein and GAL activity were exclusively located in the vacuole, whereas the protein of AGA2 and AGA 3 were found in the cytosol and chloroplast respectively. The results indicate that RFOs accumulated during the cold stress in different subcellular compartments in cucumber leaves could be catabolized in situ by different galactosidases after stress removal.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic crossovers shuffle parental genetic information, providing novel combinations of alleles on which natural or artificial selection can act. However, crossover events are relatively rare, typically one to three exchange points per chromosome pair. Recent work has identified three pathways limiting meiotic crossovers in Arabidopsis thaliana, that rely on the activity of FANCM1, RECQ42 and FIGL13, respectively. Here, we analyzed recombination in plants where one, two or three of these pathways were disrupted, in both pure line and hybrid contexts. The highest effect was observed when combining recq4 and figl1 mutations, which increased the hybrid genetic map length from 389 to 3037 centiMorgans. This corresponds to an unprecedented 7.8-fold increase in crossover frequency. Disrupting the three pathways do not further increases recombination, suggesting that some upper limit has been reached. The increase in crossovers is not uniform along chromosomes and rises from centromere to telomere. Finally, while in wild type recombination is much higher in male than in female meiosis (490 cM vs 290 cM), female recombination is higher than male in recq4 figl1 (3200 cM vs 2720 cM), suggesting that the factors that make wild-type female meiosis less recombinogenic than male wild-type meiosis do not apply in the mutant context. The massive increase of recombination observed in recq4 figl1 hybrids opens the possibility to manipulate recombination to enhance plant breeding efficiency.",

Given the overlap of genomic differences between the two edited mice that were not found in the control mouse, the authors concluded that these differences arose from a Cas9-dependent activity. We feel that this conclusion is inappropriate, for three key reasons: 1) there was incomplete analysis of the genetic variation; 2) there was no consideration that the variation is naturally arising in these animals; and 3) the inferred behavior of Cas9 lies outside of its understood mechanism of action. Attribution to Cas9 activity should require a burden of proof, that we believe has not been met.",

Manipulation of these transcription factors in model organisms has unraveled key aspects of evolution, like the transition from fin to limb.

Here, we report on evolutionary simplification in two species of the dwarf minnow genus Paedocypris using whole genome sequencing. The two species feature unprecedented Hox gene loss and genome reduction in association with their massive developmental truncation. We also show how other genes involved in the development of musculature, nervous system, and skeleton have been lost in Paedocypris, mirroring its highly progenetic phenotype. Further, we identify two mechanisms responsible for genome streamlining: severe intron shortening and reduced repeat content. As a naturally simplified system closely related to zebrafish, Paedocypris provides novel insights into vertebrate development.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering a function of a given protein requires investigating various biological aspects. Usually, the protein of interest is expressed with a fusion tag that aids or allows subsequent analyses. Additionally, downregulation or inactivation of the studied gene enables functional studies. Development of the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology opened many possibilities but in many cases it is restricted to non-essential genes. It may also be time-consuming if a homozygote is needed. Recombinase-dependent gene integration methods, like the Flp-In system, are very good alternative. The system is widely used in different research areas, which calls for the existence of compatible vectors and efficient protocols that ensure straightforward DNA cloning and creation of stable cell lines. We have created and validated a robust series of 52 vectors for streamlined generation of stable mammalian cell lines using the FLP recombinase-based methodology. Using the sequence-independent DNA cloning method all constructs for a given coding-sequence can be made with just three universal PCR primers. The collection allows tetracycline-inducible expression of proteins with various tags suitable for protein localization, FRET, bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), protein dynamics studies (FRAP), co-immunoprecipitation, the RNA tethering assay and cell sorting. Some of the vectors contain a bidirectional promoter for concomitant expression of miRNA and mRNA, so that a gene can be silenced and its product replaced by a mutated miRNA-insensitive version. We demonstrate the efficacy of our vectors by creating stable cell lines with various tagged proteins (numatrin, fibrillarin, coilin, centrin, THOC5, PCNA). We have analysed transgene expression over time to provide a guideline for future experiments and compared the utility of commonly used inducers of tetracycline-responsive promoters. We determined the protein interaction network of the exoribonuclease XRN2 and examined the role of the protein in transcription termination by RNAseq analysis of cells devoid of its ribonucleolytic activity. In total we created more than 500 DNA constructs which proves high efficiency of our strategy.",

Optical recordings show that activation of motoneurones in one spinal segment can propagate to adjacent segments even in the presence of intact recurrent inhibition. Quite remarkably, while it is known that transmission at the neuromuscular junction is purely cholinergic and Renshaw cells are excited through both acetylcholine and glutamate receptors, here we show that neurotransmission between motoneurones is purely glutamatergic indicating that synaptic transmission systems are differentiated at different post-synaptic targets of motoneurones.",

Here we tested the hypothesis that a vitamin enriched maize (CarolightR) is similar in terms of plant-arthropod interactions to its wild type when compared in controlled environment and under field conditions. In order to assess the robustness of their equivalence we tested two nitrogen availability regimes. We used arthropod field abundance, the behavior and fitness of a keystone maize herbivore - the leafhopper Zyginidia scutellaris - and above ground chemistry of maize plants (volatile, hormone and metabolite profiling) as indicators of potential changes in plant-insect interactions. Nitrogen availability was the key driver of herbivore abundance and behavior, and determined direct and indirect chemical defense in maize plants. Both genotypes presented similar constitutive and inducible phytohormone profiles independently of the nitrogen regime. However, feeding by the herbivore suppressed the levels of JA-Ile and JA, without impairing the release of induced plant volatiles. CarolightR and M37W differed to some degree in the concentrations of phenolics (hydroxycinnamic acids and lignans) and in the abundance of a volatile compound.

    "abstract": "Hydra is a fresh water hydrozoan living as a solitary polyp with a sedentary feeder lifestyle attached to a substrate. In times of food shortage they are reported to detach from their substrate and move either by drifting or  somer-saulting. The attachment to the substrate is usually by the basal-body which secretes a mucosal adhesive. The mechanical strength of the adhesion of Hydra has not been quantified so far. Here, we measure the force required to detach Hydra vulgaris and Hydra magnipapillata from a surface and the role of physical and physiological factors. In order to do this, we have developed a flow chamber with a calibrated jet of water. We find H. vulgaris adhering to a hard substrate - a glass cover slip- requires more force to detach it as compared to a soft substrate- polyacrylamide gel. While H. vulgaris after one week of starvation detaches with very similar values of stress, H. magnipapillata detaches more readily when starved. These results suggest that the strength of adhesion is strongly affected by the stiffness of the substrate, while nutritional status dependence of detachment force appears to be species dependent. Given that Hydra detachment is required during locomotion, our measurements on the one hand suggest the magnitude of forces the animal must exert to detach itself. Additionally, our results suggest active detachment of the base might be required for Hydra to achieve movement, and only a small contribution coming from weakening adhesion.",

In contrast with a compact ball, tumor cells formed a sparse mesh deeply embedded within the stroma. The concepts of inner core and invasive front broke down in this morphology: all tumor cells were within short distance from the stroma. The fibrous stroma was highly cellular and proliferative, a result confirmed in an independent series. This case was not unique: 3.5% of The Cancer Genome Atlas PTCs had purities <25%, 27% were below the 60% purity inclusion criterion. Moreover, the presence of BRAFV600E was associated with extensive fibrosis, high stromal activation, and dedifferentiation. Thus, non-tumor cells make most of the tumor mass and contribute to its expansion in a significant fraction of BRAFV600E PTCs.

Alternative approaches to patient stratification beyond current diagnostic categories are needed to understand the underlying disease processes/mechanisms.\\n\\nObjectivesTo investigate the relationship between common-variant liability for schizophrenia, indexed by polygenic risk scores (PRS) and psychotic presentations of BD, using clinical descriptions which consider both occurrence and level of mood-incongruent psychotic features.\\n\\nDesignCase-control design: using multinomial logistic regression, to estimate differential associations of PRS across categories of cases and controls.\\n\\nSettings & Participants4399 BDcases, mean [sd] age-at-interview 46[12] years, of which 2966 were woman (67%) from the BD Research Network (BDRN) were included in the final analyses, with data for 4976 schizophrenia cases and 9012 controls from the Type-1 diabetes genetics consortium and Generation Scotland included for comparison.\\n\\nExposureStandardised PRS, calculated using alleles with an association p-value threshold < 0.05 in the second Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association study of schizophrenia, adjusted for the first 10 population principal components and genotyping-platform.\\n\\nMain outcome measureMultinomial logit models estimated PRS associations with BD stratified by (1) Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) BD subtypes (2) Lifetime occurrence of psychosis.(3) Lifetime mood-incongruent psychotic features and (4) ordinal logistic regression examined PRS associations across levels of mood-incongruence. Ratings were derived from the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry interview (SCAN) and the Bipolar Affective Disorder Dimension Scale (BADDS).\\n\\nResultsAcross clinical phenotypes, there was an exposure-response gradient with the strongest PRS association for schizophrenia (RR=1.94, (95% C.1.1.86, 2.01)), then schizoaffective BD (RR=1.37, (95% C.I. 1.22, 1.54)), BD I (RR= 1.30, (95% C.I. 1.24, 1.36)) and BD II (RR=1.04, (95% C.1. 0.97, 1.11)).

    "abstract": "Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells represent an innate T cell population of emerging significance. These abundant cells can recognize ligands generated by microbes utilizing the riboflavin synthesis pathway, presented via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related molecule MR1 and binding of specific T cell receptors (TCR). They also possess an innate functional programme allowing microbial sensing in a cytokine-dependent, TCR-independent manner. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that is also associated with commensal carriage, thus host control at the mucosal interface is critical. The recognition of S. pneumoniae strains by MAIT cells has not been defined, nor have the genomics and transcriptomics of the riboflavin operon (Rib genes). We examined the expression of Rib genes in S. pneumoniae at rest and in response to metabolic stress and linked this to MAIT cell activation in vitro. We observed robust recognition of S. pneumoniae strains at rest and following stress, using both TCR-dependent and TCR-independent pathways. The pathway used was highly dependent on the antigen-presenting cell, but was maintained across a wide range of clinically-relevant strains. The riboflavin operon was highly conserved across a range of 571 S. pneumoniae from 39 countries dating back to 1916, and different versions of the riboflavin operon were also identified in related Streptococcus species. These data indicate an important functional relationship between MAIT cells and S. pneumoniae,which may be tuned by local factors, including the metabolic state of the organism and the antigen-presenting cell that it encounters.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryStreptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, causes invasive diseases such as meningitis and bacteraemia, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in children and the elderly. Here, we demonstrate that a novel T cell population called Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells is able to respond to a diverse range of S. pneumoniae strains. We found that this response was dependent on the T cell receptor (which recognises metabolites of the bacterial riboflavin biosynthesis pathway), cytokines, and the type of antigen-presenting cell. A population genomics approach was also used to assess the prevalence and diversity of the genes encoding the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway among a large and diverse collection of S. pneumoniae. These genes were highly conserved across a range of 571 S. pneumoniae from 39 countries dating back to 1916, and was also present in other related Streptococcus species. Given the low levels of MAIT cells in neonates and MAIT cell decline in the elderly, both of whom are at the highest risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, further understanding of the functional role of MAIT cells in host defense against this major pathogen may allow novel therapeutics or vaccines to be designed.",

We investigated the basis for the enhanced nerve regenerative capacity of the CAST/Ei mouse strain relative to C57BL/6 mice. RNA sequencing of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) showed a CAST/Ei specific upregulation of Ascl1 after injury. Ascl1 overexpression in C57BL/6 mice DRG neurons enhanced their neurite outgrowth. Ascl1 is regulated by miR-7048-3p, which is down-regulated in CAST/Ei mice. Inhibition of miR-7048-3p enhances neurite outgrowth. Following injury, CAST/Ei neurons largely retained their mature neuronal profile as determined by single cell RNAseq, whereas the C57BL/6 neurons acquired an immature profile. These findings suggest that one facet of the enhanced regenerative phenotype is preservation of neuronal identity in response to injury.",

    "abstract": "The gametophytic self-incompatibility (SI) mediated by S-RNase of Rosaceae, Solanaceae and Plantaginaceae, is controlled by two tightly linked genes located at highly polymorphic S-locus: the S-RNase for pistil specificity and the F-box gene (SFB/SLF) for pollen specificity, respectively. The F-box gene of peach (Prunus persica) is S haplotype-specific F-box (SFB). In this study, we selected 37 representative varieties according to the evolution route of peach and identified their S genotypes. We cloned pollen determinant genes mutant PperSFB1m, PperSFB2m, PperSFB4m and normal PperSFB2, and style determinant genes S1-RNase, S2-RNase, S2m-RNase and S4-RNase. Mutant PperSFBs were translated terminated prematurely because of fragment insertion. Yeast two-hybrid showed that mutant PperSFBs and normal PperSFB2 interacted with all S-RNases. Normal PperSFB2 was divided into four parts: box, box-V1, V1-V2 and HVa-HVb. Protein interaction analyses showed that the box portion did not interact with S-RNases, both of the box-V1 and V1-V2 had interactions with S-RNases, while the hypervariable region of PperSFB2 HVa-HVb only interacted with S2-RNase. Bioinformatics analysis of peach genome revealed that there were other F-box genes located at S-locus, and of which three F-box genes were specifically expressed in pollen, namely PperSLFL1, PperSLFL2 and PperSLFL3, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PperSFBs and PperSLFLs were classified into two different clades. Yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that as with PperSFBs, the three F-box proteins interacted with PperSSK1. Yeast two-hybrid and BiFC showed that PperSLFLs interacted with S-RNases with no allelic specificity. In vitro ubiquitination assay showed that PperSLFLs could tag ubiquitin molecules to PperS-RNases. In all, the above results suggest that three PperSLFLs are the appropriate candidates for the  general inhibitor, which would inactivate the S-RNases in pollen tubes, and the role of three PperSLFL proteins is redundant, as S-RNase repressors involved in the self-incompatibility of peach.",

However, MDA models built from different image contrasts reside in disparate spaces and their complementary information cannot be utilized easily. The aim of this work was to develop an algorithm for the non-linear alignment of two MDA models with different contrasts to create a high-resolution in vivo model of the human hippocampus with a spatial resolution of 300 m.\\n\\nMethodsA Turbo Spin Echo MDA model covering the hippocampus was contrast matched to a whole-brain MP2RAGE MDA model and aligned using cross-correlation and non-linear transformation. The contrast matching algorithm followed a global voxel location-based approach to estimate the relationship between intensity values of the two models. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by comparing it to a non-linear registration obtained using mutual information without contrast matching. The complimentary information from both contrasts was then utilized in an automated hippocampal subfield segmentation pipeline.\\n\\nResultsThe contrast of the Turbo Spin Echo MDA model could successfully be matched to the MP2RAGE MDA model. Registration using cross correlation provided more accurate alignment of the models compared to a mutual information based approach. The segmentation using ASHS resulted in hippocampal subfield delineations that resembled the tissue boundaries observed in the Turbo Spin Echo MDA model.\\n\\nConclusionThe developed contrast matching algorithm facilitated the creation of a high-resolution multi-modal in vivo MDA model of the human hippocampus. This model can be used to improve algorithms for hippocampal subfield segmentation and could potentially support the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases.",

The retrograde label DiI was injected into the ipsilateral knee to quantify the number of knee-innervating neurons in the L4 dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in wild-type mice. In vivo calcium imaging was performed on the ipsilateral L4 DRG of Pirt-GCaMP3+/- mice as mechanical stimuli (paw pinch, knee pinch, knee twist) were applied to the ipsilateral hind limb.\\n\\nResultsEight weeks after surgery, DMM mice had more hyperalgesia in the knee and hind paw compared to sham mice. Intra-articular injection of DiI labeled similar numbers of neurons in the L4 DRG of sham and DMM mice. Increased numbers of sensory neurons responded to all three mechanical stimuli in DMM mice, as assessed by in vivo calcium imaging. The majority of responses in sham and DMM mice were in small-to-medium-sized neurons, consistent with the size of nociceptors. The magnitude of responses was similar between sham and DMM mice.\\n\\nConclusionsWe demonstrated that increased numbers of small-to-medium sized DRG neurons respond to mechanical stimuli 8 weeks after DMM surgery, suggesting that nociceptors have become sensitized by lowering the response threshold.",

Using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) experiments, we show that both SpCas9-HF1 and eSpCas9(1.1) are trapped in an inactive state10 when bound to mismatched targets.

Several language families and linguistic isolates occur in this region, as well as different subsistence patterns: some groups are foragers while others are agriculturalists. In addition, speakers of Eastern Tukanoan languages are known for practicing linguistic exogamy, a marriage system in which partners must come from different language groups. In this study, we use high resolution mitochondrial DNA sequencing to investigate the impact of this linguistic and cultural diversity on the genetic relationships and structure of NWA groups.\\n\\nMethodsWe collected saliva samples from individuals representing 40 different NWA ethnolinguistic groups and sequenced 439 complete mitochondrial genomes to an average coverage of 1030x.\\n\\nResultsThe mtDNA data revealed that NWA populations have high genetic diversity with extensive sharing of haplotypes among groups. Moreover, groups who practice linguistic exogamy have higher mtDNA diversity, while the foraging Nukak have lower diversity. We also find that rivers play a more important role than either geography or language affiliation in structuring the genetic relationships of populations.\\n\\nDiscussionContrary to the view of NWA as a pristine area inhabited by small human populations living in isolation, our data support a view of high diversity and contact among different ethnolinguistic groups; movement along rivers has probably facilitated this contact. Additionally, we provide evidence for the impact of cultural practices, such as linguistic exogamy, on patterns of genetic variation.

Here, we propose a new interpretation of how the architecture of olfactory circuits is adapted to meet these immense complementary challenges. First, the diffuse binding of receptors to many molecules compresses a vast odor space into a tiny receptor space, while preserving similarity. Next, lateral interactions \\\"densify\\\" and decorrelate the response, enhancing robustness to noise. Finally, disordered projections from the periphery to the central brain reconfigure the densely packed information into a format suitable for flexible learning of associations and valences.

    "abstract": "Math Anxiety (MA) is characterized by a negative emotional response when facing math-related situations. MA is distinct from general anxiety and can emerge during primary education. Prior studies typically comprise adults and comparisons between high-versus low-MA, where neuroimaging work has focused on differences in network activation between groups when completing numerical tasks. The present study used voxel-based morphometry to identify the structural brain correlates of MA in a sample of 79 healthy children aged 7-12 years. Given that MA is thought to develop in later primary education, the study focused on the level of MA, rather than categorically defining it as present or absent. Using a battery of cognitive- and numerical-function tasks, this study identified that increased MA was associated with reduced attention, working memory and math achievement. Increased MA was associated with reduced grey matter in the left anterior intraparietal sulcus. This region was also associated with attention, suggesting that baseline differences in morphology may underpin attentional differences. Future studies should clarify whether poorer attentional capacity due to reduced grey matter density results in the later emergence of MA. Further, our data highlight the role of working memory in propagating reduced math achievement in children with higher MA.",
