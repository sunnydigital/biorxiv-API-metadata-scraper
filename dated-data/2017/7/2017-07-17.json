    "abstract": "Here I analyze the brush-fire cycle behind the brushy frontier of a grassland, seeking evolutionary feedback loops for large grazing animals and their hominin predators. Several months after a lightning strike, the burn scar grows enough new grass to expand the carrying capacity for grass-specialized herbivores,which evolved from mixed feeders in Africa during the early Pleistocene. The frontier subpopulation of grazers that discovers the auxiliary grassland quickly multiplies,creating a secondary boom for its hominin predators as well. Following this boom, a bust occurs several decades later when the brush returns; it squeezes both prey and predator populations back into the core grassland. This creates a feedback loop that can repeatedly shift the cores gene frequencies toward those of the frontier subpopulation until fixation occurs. Any brush-relevant allele could benefit from this amplifying feedback loop, so long as its phenotypes concentrate near where fresh resources can suddenly open up, back in the brush. Thus, traits concentrated in the frontier fringe can hitchhike; improved survival is not needed. This is natural selection but utilizin selective reproductive opportunity instead of the usual selective survival. Cooperative nurseries in the brushs shade should concentrate the alleles favoring eusociality, repeatedly increasing their proportion via trait hitchhiking in the feedback loop.",

    "abstract": "It is widely known that the sensitivity analysis plays a major role in computing the strength of the influence of involved factors in any phenomena under investigation. When applied to expression profiles of various intra/extracellular factors that form an integral part of a signaling pathway, the variance and density based analysis yields a range of sensitivity indices for individual as well as various combinations of factors. These combinations denote the higher order interactions among the involved factors. Computation of higher order interactions is often time consuming but they give a chance to explore the various combinations that might be of interest in the working mechanism of the pathway. For example, in a range of fourth order combinations among the various factors of the Wnt pathway, it would be easy to assess the influence of the destruction complex formed by APC, AXIN, CSKI and GSK3 interaction. But the effect of these combinations vary over time as measurements of fold changes and deviations in fold changes vary. In this work, after estimating the individual effects of factors for a higher order combination, the individual indices are considered as discriminative features. A combination, then is a multivariate feature set in higher order (>2). With an excessively large number of factors involved in the pathway, it is difficult to search for important combinations in a wide search space over different orders. Exploiting the analogy with the issues of prioritizing webpages using ranking algorithms, for a particular order, a full set of combinations of interactions can then be prioritized based on these features using a powerful ranking algorithm via support vectors. Recording the changing rankings of the combinations over time reveals of how higher order interactions behave within the pathway and when an intervention might be necessary to influence the interaction within the pathway. This could lead to development of time based therapeutic interventions.Code has been made available on Google drive at https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7Kkv8wlhPU-V1Fkd1dMSTd5ak0&usp=sharing",

    "abstract": "A time-tree is a rooted phylogenetic tree such that all internal nodes are equipped with absolute divergence dates and all leaf nodes are equipped with sampling dates. Such time-trees have become a central object of study in phylogenetics but little is known about the parameter space of such objects. Here we introduce and study a hierarchy of discrete approximations of the space of time-trees from the graph-theoretic and algorithmic point of view. One of the basic and widely used phylogenetic graphs, the NNI graph, is the roughest approximation and bottom level of our hierarchy. More refined approximations discretize the relative timing of evolutionary divergence and sampling dates. We study basic graph-theoretic questions for these graphs, including the size of neighborhoods, diameter upper and lower bounds, and the problem of finding shortest paths. We settle many of these questions by extending the concept of graph grammars introduced by Sleator, Tarjan, and Thurston to our graphs. Although time values greatly increase the number of possible trees, we show that 1-neighborhood sizes remain linear, allowing for efficient local exploration and construction of these graphs. We also obtain upper bounds on the r-neighborhood sizes of these graphs, including a smaller bound than was previously known for NNI.\\n\\nOur results open up a number of possible directions for theoretical investigation of graph-theoretic and algorithmic properties of the time-tree graphs. We discuss the directions that are most valuable for phylogenetic applications and give a list of prominent open problems for those applications. In particular, we conjecture that the split theorem applies to shortest paths in time-tree graphs, a property not shared in the general NNI case.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that visual short-term memory (VSTM) capacity estimated using simple objects, such as colours and oriented bars, may not generalise well to more naturalistic stimuli. More visual detail can be stored in VSTM when complex, recognisable objects are maintained compared to simple objects. It is not yet known if it is recognisability that enhances memory precision, nor whether maintenance of recognisable objects is achieved with the same network of brain regions supporting maintenance of simple objects.\\n\\nWe used a novel stimulus generation method to parametrically warp photographic images along a continuum, allowing separate estimation of the precision of memory representations and the number of items retained. The stimulus generation method was also designed to create unrecognisable, though perceptually matched, stimuli, to investigate the impact of recognisability on VSTM. We adapted the widely-used change detection and continuous report paradigms for use with complex, photographic images.\\n\\nAcross three functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, we demonstrated greater precision for recognisable objects in VSTM compared to unrecognisable objects. This clear behavioural advantage was not the result of recruitment of additional brain regions, or of stronger mean activity within the core network. Representational similarity analysis revealed greater variability across item repetitions in the representations of recognisable, compared to unrecognisable complex objects. We therefore propose that a richer range of neural representations support VSTM for complex recognisable objects.",

It enables detailed characterization of the mechanism of action of drugs. Furthermore, screening the expression of these genes in the tumor tissue may suggest the best course of chemotherapy or a combination of drugs to overcome drug resistance.\\n\\nResultsWe developed a computational method called ProGENI to identify genes most associated with the variation of drug response across different individuals, based on gene expression data. In contrast to existing methods, ProGENI also utilizes prior knowledge of protein-protein and genetic interactions, using random walk techniques. Analysis of two relatively new and large datasets including gene expression data on hundreds of cell lines and their cytotoxic responses to a large compendium of drugs reveals a significant improvement in prediction of drug sensitivity using genes identified by ProGENI compared to other methods. Our siRNA knockdown experiments on ProGENI-identified genes confirmed the role of many new genes in sensitivity to three chemotherapy drugs: cisplatin, docetaxel and doxorubicin. Based on such experiments and extensive literature survey, we demonstrate that about 73% our top predicted genes modulate drug response in selected cancer cell lines. In addition, global analysis of genes associated with groups of drugs uncovered pathways of cytotoxic response shared by each group.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results suggest that knowledge-guided prioritization of genes using ProGENI gives new insight into mechanisms of drug resistance and identifies genes that may be targeted to overcome this phenomenon.",

Long-read sequencing delivers much longer read lengths than short-read sequencing and may greatly improve SV detection. However, due to the relatively high cost of long-read sequencing, it is unclear what coverage is needed and how to optimally use the aligners and SV callers.\\n\\nResultsIn this study, we developed NextSV, a meta-caller to perform SV calling from low coverage long-read sequencing data. NextSV integrates three aligners and three SV callers and generates two integrated call sets (sensitive/stringent) for different analysis purposes. We evaluated SV calling performance of NextSV under different PacBio coverages on two personal genomes, NA12878 and HX1. Our results showed that, compared with running any single SV caller, NextSV stringent call set had higher precision and balanced accuracy (F1 score) while NextSV sensitive call set had a higher recall. At 10X coverage, the recall of NextSV sensitive call set was 93.5% to 94.1% for deletions and 87.9% to 93.2% for insertions, indicating that ~10X coverage might be an optimal coverage to use in practice, considering the balance between the sequencing costs and the recall rates.

    "abstract": "Dietary restriction is arguably the most promising non-pharmacological intervention to extend human life and health span. Yet, only few genetic regulators mediating the cellular response to dietary restriction are known, and the question remains which other transcription factors and regulatory pathways are involved. To gain a comprehensive view of how lifespan extension under dietary restriction is elicited, we screened the chronological lifespan of most gene deletions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae under two dietary regimens, restricted and non-restricted. We identified 472 mutants with enhanced or diminished extension of lifespan by dietary restriction. Functional analysis of such dietary-restriction genes revealed novel processes underlying longevity specifically by dietary restriction. Importantly, this set of genes allowed us to generate a prioritized catalogue of transcription factors orchestrating the dietary-restriction response, which underscored the relevance of cell-cycle arrest control as a key mechanism of chronological longevity in yeast. We show that the transcription factor Ste12 is needed for full lifespan extension and cell-cycle arrest in response to nutrient limitation; linking the pheromone/invasive growth pathway with cell survivorship. Strikingly, STE12 overexpression was sufficient to extend chronological lifespan under non-restricted conditions. Our global picture of the genetic players of longevity by dietary restriction highlights intricate regulatory cross-talks in aging cells.",

Through cell ablation, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging, we identified oscillators for C. elegans reverse locomotion. We show that the cholinergic and excitatory class A motor neurons exhibit intrinsic and oscillatory activity, and such an activity can drive reverse locomotion without premotor interneurons. Regulation of their oscillatory activity, either through effecting the P/Q/N high voltage-activated calcium channel, an endogenous constituent of their intrinsic oscillation, or, via the dual regulation by descending premotor interneurons, determines the propensity, velocity, and sustention of reverse locomotion. Thus, the reversal motor neuron themselves serve as distributed local oscillators; regulation of their intrinsic activity controls the reversal motor state. These findings exemplify anatomic and functional compression: motor executors integrate the role of rhythm generation in a locomotor network that is constrained by small cell numbers.\\n\\nHighlightsO_LIThe class A motor neurons (A-MNs) intrinsically oscillate.\\nC_LIO_LIHigh voltage-activated calcium channel is a constituent of A-MN oscillation.\\nC_LIO_LIRegulation of A-MN oscillation by interneurons determines the reversal state.\\nC_LIO_LIA-MNs integrate the role of multiple neuron types in large locomotor networks.\\nC_LI",

In this paper, we examine the use of weighted Navon T1p analysis of T1 titration data for the estimation of the dissociation constant of ethanol for the nAChR. We show that Navon T1p analysis underestimates binding affinity. The application of rigorous limits for confidence intervals within a nonlinear regression analysis of this data provides a best estimate of Kd = 55 M at 4 {degrees}C. within an unsymmetrical 90% confidence interval of [0.5, 440 M].

By comparing diffraction-limited images and super-resolution equivalents of the same focal volume, this approach generates a quantitative map of super-resolution defects, as well as methods for their correction. To illustrate its broad applicability to super-resolution approaches we apply our method to Localization Microscopy, STED and SIM images of a variety of in-cell structures including microtubules, poxviruses, neuronal actin rings and clathrin coated pits. We particularly focus on single-molecule localisation microscopy, where super-resolution reconstructions often feature imperfections not present in the original data. By showing the quantitative evolution of data quality over these varied sample preparation, acquisition and super-resolution methods we display the potential of NanoJ-SQUIRREL to guide optimization of superresolution imaging parameters.",

    "abstract": "Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells represent an innate T cell population of emerging significance. These abundant cells can recognize ligands generated by microbes utilizing the riboflavin synthesis pathway, presented via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related molecule MR1 and binding of specific T cell receptors (TCR). They also possess an innate functional programme allowing microbial sensing in a cytokine-dependent, TCR-independent manner. Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen that is also associated with commensal carriage, thus host control at the mucosal interface is critical. The recognition of S. pneumoniae strains by MAIT cells has not been defined, nor have the genomics and transcriptomics of the riboflavin operon (Rib genes). We examined the expression of Rib genes in S. pneumoniae at rest and in response to metabolic stress and linked this to MAIT cell activation in vitro. We observed robust recognition of S. pneumoniae strains at rest and following stress, using both TCR-dependent and TCR-independent pathways. The pathway used was highly dependent on the antigen-presenting cell, but was maintained across a wide range of clinically-relevant strains. The riboflavin operon was highly conserved across a range of 571 S. pneumoniae from 39 countries dating back to 1916, and different versions of the riboflavin operon were also identified in related Streptococcus species. These data indicate an important functional relationship between MAIT cells and S. pneumoniae,which may be tuned by local factors, including the metabolic state of the organism and the antigen-presenting cell that it encounters.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryStreptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, causes invasive diseases such as meningitis and bacteraemia, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in children and the elderly. Here, we demonstrate that a novel T cell population called Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells is able to respond to a diverse range of S. pneumoniae strains. We found that this response was dependent on the T cell receptor (which recognises metabolites of the bacterial riboflavin biosynthesis pathway), cytokines, and the type of antigen-presenting cell. A population genomics approach was also used to assess the prevalence and diversity of the genes encoding the riboflavin biosynthesis pathway among a large and diverse collection of S. pneumoniae. These genes were highly conserved across a range of 571 S. pneumoniae from 39 countries dating back to 1916, and was also present in other related Streptococcus species. Given the low levels of MAIT cells in neonates and MAIT cell decline in the elderly, both of whom are at the highest risk of invasive pneumococcal disease, further understanding of the functional role of MAIT cells in host defense against this major pathogen may allow novel therapeutics or vaccines to be designed.",

    "abstract": "Most tropical bird species have narrow elevational ranges, likely reflecting climatic specialization. This is consistent with Janzens Rule, the tendency for mountain passes to be effectively  higher in the tropics. Hence, those few tropical species that occur across broad elevational gradients raise questions. Are they being sundered by diversifying selection along the gradient? Does elevational movement cause them to resist diversification or specialization? Have they recently expanded, suggesting that elevational generalism is short-lived in geological time? Here we tested for differentiation, movement, and expansion in four elevational generalist songbird species on the Andean west slope. We used morphology and mtDNA to test for genetic differentiation between high- and low-elevation populations. Morphology differed for House Wren (Troglodytes aedon) and Hooded Siskin (Spinus magellanicus), but not for Cinereous Conebill (Conirostrum cinereum) and Rufous-collared Sparrow (Zonotrichia capensis), respectively. mtDNA was structured by elevation only in Z. capensis. To test for elevational movements, we measured hydrogen isotope ({delta}2H) values of metabolically inert feathers and metabolically active liver. {delta}2H data indicated elevational movements by two tree- and shrub-foraging species with moderate-to-high vagility (C. cinereum and S. magellanicus), and sedentary behavior by two terrestrial-foraging species with low-to-moderate vagility (T. aedon and Z. capensis). In S. magellanicus, elevational movements and lack of mtDNA structure contrast with striking morphological divergence, suggesting strong diversifying selection on body proportions across the [~]50 km gradient. All species except C. cinereum exhibited mtDNA-haplotype variation consistent with recent population expansion across the elevational gradient.In sum,three out of four elevational generalist species underwent genetic divergence despite gene flow, two of four make seasonal elevational movements, and three of four have recently expanded. In different ways, each species defies the tendency for tropical birds to have long-term stable distributions and sedentary habits. We conclude that tropical elevational generalism is rare due to evolutionary instability.",

Parkinsons disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons and the emergence of strong {beta}-band (15-35Hz) oscillations throughout the basal ganglia nuclei. Here we combine experimental stimulation data from ten studies, that reveal the timing of excitatory and inhibitory events in the basal ganglia circuit, to estimate its set of transmission delays. In doing so, we reveal possible inconsistencies in the existing data, calling for replications, and we propose two possible sets of transmission delays.\n\nWe then integrate these delays in a model of the primate basal ganglia, that does not rely on direct and indirect pathways segregation, and show that, while much attention has been given to the role of the striatal dopaminergic receptors in Parkinsons disease symptoms, extrastriatal dopaminergic depletion in the external part of the globus pallidus and in the subthalamic nucleus is sufficient to generate {beta}-band oscillations in the high part of the band. More specifically, we show that that D2 and D5 dopamine receptors in these nuclei play opposing roles in the emergence of {beta}-band oscillations, thereby explaining how completely deactivating D5 receptors in the subthalamic nucleus can, paradoxically, cancel oscillations.",

Here, we demonstrate how natural depth variation impacts performance in two fundamental tasks related to stereopsis: half-occlusion detection and disparity detection. We report the results of a computational study that uses a large database of calibrated natural stereo-images with precisely co-registered laser-based distance measurements. First, we develop a procedure for precisely sampling stereo-image patches from the stereo-images, based on the distance measurements. The local depth variation in each stereo-image patch is quantified by disparity contrast. Next, we show that increased disparity contrast degrades performance in half-occlusion detection and disparity detection tasks, and changes the size and shape of the optimal spatial integration areas (\\\"receptive fields\\\") for computing the task-relevant decision variables. Then, we show that a simple binocular image statistic predicts disparity contrast in natural scenes. Finally, we report results on the most likely patterns of disparity variation in natural scenes. Our findings motivate computational and psychophysical investigations of the mechanisms that underlie disparity estimation in local regions of natural scenes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe regulatory roles of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) in humans have been revealed through the use of advanced sequencing technology. Recently, three possible scenarios of lincRNA origin have been proposed: de novo origination from intergenic regions, duplication from long noncoding RNA, and pseudogenization from protein. The first two scenarios are largely studied and supported, yet few studies focused on the evolution from pseudo genized protein-coding sequence to lincRNA. Due to the non-mutually exclusive nature that these three scenarios have, accompanied by the need of systematic investigation of lincRNA origination, we conduct a comparative genomics study to investigate the evolution of human lincRNAs.\\n\\nResultsCombining with syntenic analysis and stringent Blastn e-value cutoff, we found that the majority of lincRNAs are aligned to the intergenic regions of other species. Interestingly, 193 human lincRNAs could have protein-coding orthologs in at least two of nine vertebrates. Transposable elements in these conserved regions in human genome are much less than expectation. Moreover, 19% of these lincRNAs have overlaps with or are close to pseudogenes in the human genome.\\n\\nConclusionsWe suggest that a notable portion of lincRNAs could be derived from pseudogenized protein-coding genes. Furthermore, based on our computational analysis, we hypothesize that a subset of these lincRNAs could have potential to regulate their paralogs by functioning as competing endogenous RNAs. Our results provide evolutionary evidence of the relationship between human lincRNAs and protein-coding genes.",

Licensing is restricted to G1 phase of the cell cycle, but G1 length varies widely among cell types. Using quantitative single cell analyses we found that pluripotent stem cells with naturally short G1 phases load MCM much faster than their isogenic differentiated counterparts with long G1 phases. During the earliest stages of differentiation towards all lineages, MCM loading slows concurrently with G1 lengthening, revealing developmental control of MCM loading. In contrast, ectopic Cyclin E overproduction uncouples short G1 from fast MCM loading. Rapid licensing in stem cells is caused by accumulation of the MCM loading protein, Cdt1. Prematurely slowing MCM loading in pluripotent cells not only lengthens G1 but also accelerates differentiation. Thus, rapid origin licensing is an intrinsic characteristic of stem cells that contributes to pluripotency maintenance.",

Here, we propose a statistical inference framework for estimating these nuanced effects of volatile SRs.\\n\\nMethodsWe fitted a continuous-time Markov chain model in a Bayesian framework to mark-release-recapture (MRR) data from an experimental hut study conducted in Iquitos, Peru. We estimated the effects of two dosages of transfluthrin on Ae. aegypti behaviors associated with human-vector contact: repellency, exiting, and knockdown in the treated space and in \\\"downstream\\\" adjacent huts. We validated the framework using simulated data.\\n\\nResultsThe odds of a female Ae. aegypti being repelled from a treated hut (HT) increased at both dosages (low dosage: odds = 1.64, 95% highest density interval (HDI) = 1.30-2.09; high dosage: odds = 1.35, HDI = 1.04-1.67). The relative risk of exiting from the treated hut was reduced (low: RR = 0.70, HDI = 0.62-1.09; high: RR = 0.70, HDI = 0.40-1.06), with this effect carrying over to untreated spaces as far as two huts away from the treated hut (H2) (low: RR = 0.79, HDI = 0.59-1.01; high: RR = 0.66, HDI = 0.50-0.87). Knockdown rates were increased in both treated and downstream huts, particularly under high dosage (HT: RR = 8.37, HDI = 2.11-17.35; H1: RR = 1.39, HDI = 0.52-2.69; H2: RR = 2.22, HDI = 0.96-3.86).\\n\\nConclusionsOur statistical inference framework is effective at elucidating multiple effects of volatile chemicals used in SR products, as well as their downstream effects. This framework provides a powerful tool for early selection of candidate SR product formulations worth advancing to costlier epidemiological trials, which are ultimately necessary for proof of concept of public health value and subsequent formal endorsement by health authorities.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic relationships among the basal orders of winged insects remain unclear, in particular the relationship of the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and the Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) with the Neoptera. Insect evolution is thought to have followed rapid divergence in the distant past and phylogenetic reconstruction may therefore be susceptible to problems of taxon sampling, choice of outgroup, marker selection, and tree reconstruction method. Here we newly sequenced three mitochondrial genomes representing the two most diverse families of the Ephemeroptera, one of which is a basal lineage of the order. We then used an additional 90 insect mitochondrial genomes to reconstruct their phylogeny using Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches. Bayesian analysis supported a basal Odonata hypothesis, with Ephemeroptera as sister group to the remaining insects. This was only supported when using an optimized data matrix from which rogue taxa and terminals affected by long-branch attraction were removed. None of our analyses supported a basal Ephemeroptera hypothesis or Ephemeroptera + Odonata as monophyletic clade sister to other insects (i.e., the Palaeoptera hypothesis). Our newly sequenced mitochondrial genomes of Baetis rutilocylindratus, Cloeon dipterum, and Habrophlebiodes zijinensis had a complete set of protein coding genes and a conserved orientation except for two inverted tRNAs in H. zijinensis. Increased mayfly sampling, removal of problematic taxa, and a Bayesian phylogenetic framework were needed to infer phylogenetic relationships within the three ancient insect lineages of Odonata, Ephemeroptera, and Neoptera. Pruning of rogue taxa improved the number of supported nodes in all phylogenetic trees. Our results add to previous evidence for the Odonata hypothesis and indicate that the phylogenetic resolution of the basal insects can be resolved with more data and sampling effort.",

    "abstract": "Genome expansion is believed to be an important driver of the evolution of gene regulation. To investigate the role of newly arising sequence in rewiring the regulatory network we estimated the age of each region of the human genome by applying maximum parsimony to genome-wide alignments with 100 vertebrates. We then studied the age distribution of several types of functional regions, with a focus on regulatory elements. The age distribution of regulatory elements reveals the extensive use of newly formed genomic sequence in the evolution of regulatory interactions. Many transcription factors have expanded their repertoire of targets through waves of genomic expansions that can be traced to specific evolutionary times. Repeated elements contributed a major part of such expansion: many classes of such elements are enriched in binding sites of one or a few specific transcription factors, whose binding sites are localized in specific portions of the element and characterized by distinctive motif words. These features suggest that the binding sites were available as soon as the new sequence entered the genome, rather than being created later by accumulation of point mutations. By comparing the age of regulatory regions to the evolutionary shift in expression of nearby genes we show that rewiring through genome expansion played an important role in shaping the human regulatory network.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cold water disease (BCWD) causes significant mortality and economic losses in salmonid aquaculture. In previous studies, we identified moderate-large effect QTL for BCWD resistance in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). However, the recent availability of a 57K SNP array and a genome physical map have enabled us to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that overcome several experimental limitations from our previous work. In the current study, we conducted GWAS for BCWD resistance in two rainbow trout breeding populations using two genotyping platforms, the 57K Affymetrix SNP array and restriction-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing. Overall, we identified 14 moderate-large effect QTL that explained up to 60.8% of the genetic variance in one of the two populations and 27.7% in the other. Four of these QTL were found in both populations explaining a substantial proportion of the variance, although major differences were also detected between the two populations. Our results confirm that BCWD resistance is controlled by the oligogenic inheritance of few moderate-large effect loci and a large-unknown number of loci each having a small effect on BCWD resistance. We detected differences in QTL number and genome location between two GWAS models (weighted single-step GBLUP and Bayes B), which highlights the utility of using different models to uncover QTL. The RAD-SNPs detected a greater number of QTL than the 57K SNP array in one population, suggesting that the RAD-SNPs may uncover polymorphisms that are more unique and informative for the specific population in which they were discovered.",

    "abstract": "Background & MethodsThe ICONIC project has developed an automated high-throughput pipeline to generate HIV nearly full-length genomes (NFLG, i.e. from gag to nef) from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The pipeline was applied to 420 HIV samples collected at University College London Hospital and Barts Health NHS Trust (London) and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Cambridge). Consensus genomes were generated and subtyped using COMET, and unique recombinants were studied with jpHMM and SimPlot. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed using RAxML to identify transmission networks using the Cluster Picker.\\n\\nResultsThe pipeline generated sequences of at least 1Kb of length (median=7.4Kb) for 375 out of the 420 samples (89%), with 174 (46.4%) being NFLG. A total of 365 sequences (169 of them NFLG) corresponded to unique subjects and were included in the down-stream analyses. The most frequent HIV subtypes were B (n=149, 40.8%) and C (n=77, 21.1%) and the circulating recombinant form CRF02_AG (n=32, 8.8%). We found 14 different CRFs (n=66, 18.1%) and multiple URFs (n=32, 8.8%) that involved recombination between 12 different subtypes/CRFs. The most frequent URFs were B/CRF01_AE (4 cases) and A1/D, B/C, and B/CRF02_AG (3 cases each). Most URFs (19/26, 73%) lacked breakpoints in the PR+RT pol region, rendering them undetectable if only that was sequenced. Twelve (37.5%) of the URFs could have emerged within the UK, whereas the rest were probably imported from sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and South America. For 2 URFs we found highly similar pol sequences circulating in the UK. We detected 31 phylogenetic clusters using the full dataset: 25 pairs (mostly subtypes B and C), 4 triplets and 2 quadruplets. Some of these were not consistent across different genes due to inter- and intra-subtype recombination. Clusters involved 70 sequences, 19.2% of the dataset.\\n\\nConclusionsThe initial analysis of genome sequences detected substantial hidden variability in the London HIV epidemic. Analysing full genome sequences, as opposed to only PR+RT, identified previously undetected recombinants. It provided a more reliable description of CRFs (that would be otherwise misclassified) and transmission clusters.",

    "abstract": "Scandinavia was one of the last geographic areas in Europe to become habitable for humans after the last glaciation. However, the origin(s) of the first colonizers and their migration routes remain unclear. We sequenced the genomes, up to 57x coverage, of seven hunter-gatherers excavated across Scandinavia and dated to 9,500-6,000 years before present. Surprisingly, among the Scandinavian Mesolithic individuals, the genetic data display an east-west genetic gradient that opposes the pattern seen in other parts of Mesolithic Europe. This result suggests that Scandinavia was initially colonized following two different routes: one from the south, the other from the northeast. The latter followed the ice-free Norwegian north Atlantic coast, along which novel and advanced pressure-blade stone-tool techniques may have spread. These two groups met and mixed in Scandinavia, creating a genetically diverse population, which shows patterns of genetic adaptation to high latitude environments. These adaptations include high frequencies of low pigmentation variants and a gene-region associated with physical performance, which shows strong continuity into modern-day northern Europeans.",

    "abstract": "Topologically associating domains (TADs) are fundamental elements of the 3D structure of the eukaryotic genome. However, while the structural importance of the insulator protein CTCF together with cohesin at TAD borders in mammalian cells is well established, the absence of such co-localization at most TAD borders in recent Hi-C studies of D. melanogaster is enigmatic, raising the possibility that these TAD border elements are not generally conserved among metazoans. Using in situ Hi-C with sub-kb resolution, we show that the genome of D. melanogaster is almost completely partitioned into more than 4,000 TADs (median size, 13 kb), nearly 7-fold more than previously identified. The overwhelming majority of these TADs are demarcated by pairs of Drosophila specific insulator proteins, BEAF-32/CP190 or BEAF-32/Chromator, indicating that these proteins may play an analogous role in Drosophila as that of the CTCF/cohesin pair in mammals. Moreover, we find that previously identified TADs enriched for inactive chromatin are predominantly assembled from the higher-level interactions between smaller TADs. In contrast, the contiguous small TADs in regions previously thought to be unstructured \\\"inter-TADs\\\" are organized in an open configuration with far fewer TAD-TAD interactions. Such structures can also be identified in some \\\"inter-TAD\\\" regions of the mammalian genome, suggesting that larger assemblages of small self-associating TADs separated by a \\\"burst\\\" of contiguous small, weakly associating TADs may be a conserved, basic characteristic of the higher order folding of the metazoan genome.",

Understanding how specific DDMCs are transported to and within the cell and what controls their binding selectivity to different proteins is crucial for defining the mechanisms of metalloproteins. To better understand such processes, we scanned the RCSB Protein Data Bank, performed a de novo structural-based comprehensive analysis of seven DDMCs and found their amino acid binding and coordination geometry propensities. We then utilized these results to characterize the correlation between metal selectivity, specific binding site composition and phylogenetic classification of the cation diffusion facilitator (CDF) protein family, a family of DDMC transporters found throughout evolution and sharing a conserved structure, yet with different members displaying distinct metal selectivity. Our analysis shows that DDMCs differ, at times significantly, in terms of their binding propensities, and that in each CDF clade, the metal selectivity-related binding site has a unique and conserved sequence signature. However, only limited correlation exists between the composition of the DDMC binding site in each clade and the metal selectivity shown by its proteins.",

Despite its importance, sister chromatid recombination is not easily studied because it does not result in a change in DNA sequence, making recombination between sister chromatids difficult to detect. We have previously developed a novel DNA template strand sequencing technique, called Strand-seq, that can be used to map sister chromatid exchange (SCE) events genome-wide in single cells. An increase in the rate of SCE is an indicator of elevated recombination activity and of genome instability, which is a hallmark of cancer. In this study, we have adapted Strand-seq to detect SCE in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Contrary to what is commonly thought, we find that most spontaneous SCE events are not due to the repair of DNA double-strand breaks.",

Temporal imaging of spheroids can capture the dynamics of cell behaviors and microenvironments, and when combined with quantitative image analysis methods, enables deep interrogation of biological mechanisms. This paper presents a comprehensive open-source software framework for Temporal Analysis of Spheroid Imaging (TASI) that allows investigators to objectively characterize spheroid growth and invasion dynamics. TASI performs spatiotemporal segmentation of spheroid cultures, extraction of features describing spheroid morpho-phenotypes, mathematical modeling of spheroid dynamics, and statistical comparisons of experimental conditions.

Although plant DNA barcodes do not always provide species-level resolution, the generation of large DNA barcode datasets can provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the generation of species diversity. Here, we use DNA barcoding to study evolutionary processes in taxonomically complex British Euphrasia, a group with multiple ploidy levels, frequent self- fertilization, young species divergence and widespread hybridisation.\\n\\nMethodsWe sequenced the core plant barcoding loci, supplemented with additional nuclear and plastid loci, in representatives of all 19 British Euphrasia species. We analyse these data in a population genetic and phylogenetic framework. We then date the divergence of haplotypes in a global Euphrasia dataset using a time-calibrated Bayesian approach implemented in BEAST.\\n\\nKey resultsNo Euphrasia species has a consistent diagnostic haplotype. Instead, haplotypes are either widespread across species, or are population specific. Nuclear genetic variation is strongly partitioned by ploidy levels, with diploid and tetraploid British Euphrasia possessing deeply divergent ITS haplotypes (DXY = 5.1%), with haplotype divergence corresponding to the late Miocene. In contrast, plastid data show no clear division by ploidy, and instead reveal weakly supported geographic patterns.\\n\\nConclusionsUsing standard DNA barcoding loci for species identification in Euphrasia will be unsuccessful. However, these loci provide key insights into the maintenance of genetic variation, with divergence of diploids and tetraploids suggesting that ploidy differences act as a barrier to gene exchange in British Euphrasia, with rampant hybridisation within ploidy levels. The scarcity of shared diploid-tetraploid ITS haplotypes supports the polyploids being allotetraploid in origin. Overall, these results show that even when lacking species-level resolution, DNA barcoding can reveal insightful evolutionary patterns in taxonomically complex genera.",

Enhancers are typically predicted via chromatin marks, yet their function is primarily assessed with plasmid-based reporter assays. Here, we show that two previous observations relating to plasmid-transfection into human cells render such assays unreliable: (1) the function of the bacterial plasmid origin-of-replication (ORI) as a conflicting core-promoter and (2) the activation of a type I interferon (IFN-I) response. These problems cause strongly confounding false-positives and -negatives in luciferase assays and genome-wide STARR-seq screens. We overcome both problems by directly employing the ORI as a core-promoter and by inhibiting two kinases central to IFN-I induction. This corrects luciferase assays and enables genome-wide STARR-seq screens in human cells. Comprehensive enhancer activity profiles in HeLa-S3 cells uncover strong enhancers, IFN-I-induced enhancers, and enhancers endogenously silenced at the chromatin level. Our findings apply to all episomal enhancer activity assays in mammalian cells, and are key to the characterization of human enhancers.",

It has proven difficult to disentangle these inflationary effects from true polygenic effects. Here we present results of a model that enables estimation of polygenicity, mean strength of association, and residual inflation in GWAS summary statistics. We show that there is substantial residual inflation in recent large GWAS of height and schizophrenia; correcting for this reduces the number of independent genome-wide significant loci from the reported values of 697 for height and 108 for schizophrenia to 368 and 61, respectively. In contrast, a larger GWAS of educational attainment shows no residual inflation. Additionally, we find that height has a relatively low polygenicity, with approximately 8k SNPs having causal association, more than an order of magnitude less than has been reported. The residual inflation in GWAS summary statistics can be corrected using the standard genomic control procedure with the estimated residual inflation factor.",

    "abstract": "India represents an intricate tapestry of population substructure shaped by geography, language, culture and social stratification. While geography closely correlates with genetic structure in other parts of the world, the strict endogamy imposed by the Indian caste system and the large number of spoken languages add further levels of complexity to understand Indian population structure. To date, no study has attempted to model and evaluate how these factors have interacted to shape the patterns of genetic diversity within India. We merged all publicly available data from the Indian subcontinent into a data set of 891 individuals from 90 well-defined groups. Bringing together geography, genetics and demographic factors, we developed COGG (Correlation Optimization of Genetics and Geodemographics) to build a model that explains the observed population genetic substructure. We show that shared language along with social structure have been the most powerful forces in creating paths of gene flow in the subcontinent. Furthermore, we discover the ethnic groups that best capture the diverse genetic substructure highlighted by COGG. Integrating data from India with a data set of additional 1,323 individuals from 50 populations we find that Europeans show shared genetic drift with the Indo-European and Dravidian speakers of India, whereas the East Asians have the maximum shared genetic drift with Tibeto-Burman speaking tribal groups.",

Some microorganisms have developed mechanisms to degrade these compounds, but their aerobic and anaerobic degradation is inhibited in presence of heavy metals, such as mercury or lead. In this report, the degradation of benzene and other aromatic compounds catalyzed by the metal resistant bacterium Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34 was characterized. A metabolic reconstruction of aromatic catabolic pathways was performed based on bioinformatics analyses. Functionality of the predicted pathways was confirmed by growing strain CH34 on benzene, toluene, o-xylene, p-cymene, 3-hydroxybenzoate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, 3-hydroxyphenylacetate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, homogentisate, catechol, naphthalene, and 2-aminophenol as sole carbon and energy sources. Benzene catabolic pathway was further characterized. Results showed that firstly benzene is transformed into phenol and, thereafter, into catechol. Benzene is degraded under aerobic conditions via a combined pathway catalyzed by three Bacterial Multicomponent Monooxygenases: a toluene-2-monoxygenase (TomA012345), a toluene-4-monooxygenase (TmoABCDEF) and a phenol-2-hydroxylase (PhyZABCDE). A catechol-2,3-dioxygenase (TomB) expressed at early exponential phase cleaves the catechol ring in meta-position; an ortho-cleavage of catechol is accomplished by a catechol-1,2-dioxygenase (CatA) at late exponential phase instead. This study additionally shows that C. metallidurans CH34 is capable of degrading benzene in presence of heavy metals, such as Hg(II) or Pb(II).

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle channelopathies, many of which are inherited as autosomal dominant mutations, include both myotonia and periodic paralysis. Myotonia is defined by a delayed relaxation after muscular contraction, whereas periodic paralysis is defined by episodic attacks of weakness. One sub-type of periodic paralysis, known as hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP), is associated with low potassium levels. Interestingly, the P1158S missense mutant, located in the third domain S4-S5 linker of the   skeletal muscle voltage-gated sodium channel, Nav1.4, has been implicated in causing both myotonia and hypoPP. A common trigger for these conditions is physical activity. We previously reported that Nav1.4 is relatively insensitive to changes in extracellular pH compared to Nav1.2 and Nav1.5. Given that intense exercise is often accompanied by blood acidosis, we decided to test whether changes in pH would push gating in P1158S towards either phenotype. Our results indicate that, unlike in WT Nav1.4, low pH depolarizes the voltage-dependence of activation and steady-state fast inactivation, decreases current density, and increases late currents in P1185S. Thus, P1185S turns the normally pH-insensitive Nav1.4 into a proton-sensitive channel. Using action potential modeling we also predict a pH-to-phenotype correlation in patients with P1158S. We conclude that activities which alter blood pH may trigger myotonia or periodic paralysis in P1158S patients.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTVoltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) contribute to the physiology and pathophysiology of electrical signaling in excitable cells. Nav subtypes are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, thus they respond differently to physiological modulators. For instance, the cardiac subtype, Nav1.5, can be modified by changes in blood pH; however, the skeletal muscle subtype, Nav1.4, is mostly pH-insensitive. Nav1.4 mutants can mostly cause either hyper-or hypo-excitability in skeletal muscles, leading to conditions such as myotonia or periodic paralysis. P1158S uniquely causes both phenotypes. This study investigates pH-sensitivity in P1158S, and describes how physiological pH changes can push P1158S to cause myotonia and periodic paralysis.",

    "abstract": "How individuals move through their environment dictates which other individuals they encounter, determining their social and reproductive interactions and the extent to which they experience sexual selection. Specifically, females rarely have the option of mating with all males in a population--they can only choose among the males they encounter. Further, quantifying phenotypic differences between the males that females encounter and those that sire females offspring lends insight into how social and reproductive interactions shape male phenotypes. We used an explicitly spatiotemporal Markov chain model to estimate the number of potential mates of Anolis sagrei lizards from their movement behavior, and used genetic paternity assignments to quantify sexual selection on males. Females frequently encountered and mated with multiple males, offering ample opportunity for female mate choice. Sexual selection favored males that were bigger and moved over larger areas, though the effect of body size cannot be disentangled from last-male precedence. Our approach corroborates some patterns of sexual selection previously hypothesized in anoles based on describing them as territorial, whereas other results, including female multiple mating itself, are at odds with territorial polygyny, offering insight into discrepancies in other taxa between behavioral and genetic descriptions of mating systems.",

    "abstract": "Heritability is a fundamental parameter in genetics. Traditional estimates based on family or twin studies can be biased due to shared environmental or non-additive genetic variance. Alternatively, those based on genotyped or imputed variants typically underestimate narrow-sense heritability contributed by rare or otherwise poorly-tagged causal variants. Identical-by-descent (IBD) segments of the genome share all variants between pairs of chromosomes except new mutations that have arisen since the last common ancestor. Therefore, relating phenotypic similarity to degree of IBD sharing among classically unrelated individuals is an appealing approach to estimating the near full additive genetic variance while avoiding biases that can occur when modeling close relatives. We applied an IBD-based approach (GREML-IBD) to estimate heritability in unrelated individuals using phenotypic simulation with thousands of whole genome sequences across a range of stratification, polygenicity levels, and the minor allele frequencies of causal variants (CVs). IBD-based heritability estimates were unbiased when using unrelated individuals, even for traits with extremely rare CVs, but stratification led to strong biases in IBD-based heritability estimates with poor precision. We used data on two traits in ~120,000 people from the UK Biobank to demonstrate that, depending on the trait and possible confounding environmental effects, GREML-IBD can be applied successfully to very large genetic datasets to infer the contribution of very rare variants lost using other methods. However, we observed apparent biases in this real data that were not predicted from our simulation, suggesting that more work may be required to understand factors that influence IBD-based estimates.",

    "abstract": "Synchronous and bilateral spike-and-wave discharges accompany nonconvulsive behavioral and cognitive arrest during seizures associated with absence epilepsy. Previous investigation of multiple absence animal models suggests that the underlying cause of absence seizures is an increase in thalamic inhibitory tonic currents. In contrast, in this study we provide evidence that the level of cortical tonic inhibition also regulates absence seizure expression. Using continuous video-EEG recordings to monitor absence seizures and spike-and-wave discharge expression we show that pharmacological blockade of cortical tonic inhibition provokes absence seizures in wild-type mice. Furthermore, we show that pharmacological rescue of cortical tonic inhibition in an absence mouse ({gamma}2R43Q) model, which lacks tonic inhibition, suppresses absence seizure and spike-and-wave discharge expression. Collectively, these results suggest an optimum level of tonic inhibition in the thalamocortical circuit is required for normal functioning and that a deviation from this optimum results in aberrant thalamocortical function, SWDs and absence seizures.",

    "abstract": "During mammalian cerebellar development, postnatal granule cell progenitors proliferate in the outer part of the External Granule Layer (EGL). Postmitotic granule progenitors migrate tangentially in the inner EGL before switching to migrate radially inward, past the Purkinje cell layer, to achieve their final position in the mature Granule Cell Layer (GCL). Here, we show that the RacGAP {beta}-chimaerin is expressed by a small population of late-born, premigratory granule cells. {beta}-chimaerin deficiency causes a subset of granule cells to become arrested in the EGL, where they differentiate and form ectopic neuronal clusters. These clusters of granule cells are able to recruit aberrantly projecting mossy fibers. Collectively, these data suggest a role for {beta}-chimaerin as an intracellular mediator of Cerebellar Granule Cell radial migration.",
