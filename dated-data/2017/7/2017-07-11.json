    "abstract": "NOTEThe biases seen in simulations of Temporal Clustering appear to be even worse in real applications. While this was a novel and interesting approach, ultimately this work has been discontinued. I feel the biases are due to propagated error in estimating individual level offsets based on a single noisy measure, amplified by the fact that high MMSE scores change very slowly and therefore many estimates are from near an asymptote on the left hand of the model. We continue to work in this area, with other approaches showing significantly more promise.\\n\\nUnderstanding heterogeneity in Alzheimers disease (AD) progression is critically important for the optimal design of trials, allowing participants to be recruited who are correctly diagnosed and who are likely to undergo cognitive decline. Current knowledge about heterogeneity is limited by the paucity of long-term follow-up data and methodological challenges. Of the latter, a key problem is how to choose the most appropriate  time zero to use in longitudinal models, a choice which affects results. Rather than a pre-specified  time zero we propose a novel methodology - Temporal Clustering - that defines a new  time zero using individual offsets inferred from the data. We applied this to longitudinal Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), where this approach ensures that individuals have similar estimated MMSE scores at this new  time zero. Simulations showed that it could accurately predict cluster membership after the application of a filter. Next we applied it to a cohort of 2412 individuals, with large variability in MMSE score at first visit. Temporal Clustering was used to split individuals into two clusters. The group showing faster decline had higher average levels of AD risk factors: cerebrospinal fluid tau and APOE [isin]4. Cluster membership predicted by Temporal Clustering was less affected by individuals cognitive ability at first visit than was the case for clusters found using Latent Class Mixture Models. Further application and development of this method will help researchers to identify risk factors affecting cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "A brief burst-suppressing isoflurane anesthesia has been shown to rapidly alleviate symptoms of depression in a subset of patients, but the neurobiological basis of these observations remains obscure. We show that a single isoflurane anesthesia produces antidepressant-like behavioural effects in the learned helplessness paradigm and regulates molecular events implicated in the mechanism of action of rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine: activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) receptor TrkB, facilitation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3{beta} (GSK3{beta}). Moreover, isoflurane affected neuronal plasticity by facilitating long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. We also found that isoflurane increased activity of the parvalbumin interneurons, and facilitated GABAergic transmission in wild type mice but not in transgenic mice with reduced TrkB expression in parvalbumin interneurons. Our findings strengthen the role of TrkB signaling in the antidepressant responses and encourage further evaluation of isoflurane as a rapid-acting antidepressant devoid of the psychotomimetic effects and abuse potential of ketamine.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated many low-penetrance loci in schizophrenia. However, its pathological mechanisms are poorly understood, which in turn hampers the development of novel pharmacological treatments. Pathway and gene set analyses carry the potential to generate hypotheses about disease mechanisms and have provided biological context to genome-wide data of schizophrenia. We aimed to examine which biological processes are likely candidates to underlie schizophrenia by integrating novel and powerful pathway analysis tools using data from the largest Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia GWAS (N = 79 845) and the most recent 2018 schizophrenia GWAS (N = 105 318). By applying a primary unbiased analysis (Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation; MAGMA) to weigh the role of biological processes from the MSigDB database, we identified enrichment of common variants in synaptic plasticity and neuron differentiation gene sets. We supported these findings using MAGMA, Meta-Analysis Gene-set Enrichment of variaNT Associations (MAGENTA) and Interval Enrichment Analysis (INRICH) on detailed synaptic signaling pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and found enrichment in mainly the dopaminergic and cholinergic synapses. Moreover, shared genes involved in these neurotransmitter systems had a large contribution to the observed enrichment, protein products of top genes in these pathways showed more direct and indirect interactions than expected by chance, and expression profiles of these genes were largely similar among brain tissues. In conclusion, we provide strong and consistent genetics and protein-interaction informed evidence for the role of postsynaptic signaling processes in schizophrenia, opening avenues for future translational and psychopharmacological studies.",

    "abstract": "Nearly half of the human genome is made up of transposable elements (TEs) and there is evidence that TEs are involved in gene regulation. Here, we have integrated publicly available genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic data to investigate this in a genome-wide manner. A bootstrapping statistical method was applied to minimize the confounder effects from different repeat types. Our results show that although most TE classes are primarily associated with reduced gene expression, Alu elements are associated with up regulated gene expression. Furthermore, Alu elements had the highest probability of any TE class of contributing to regulatory regions of any type defined by chromatin state. This suggests a general model where clade specific SINEs may contribute more to gene regulation than ancient/ancestral TEs. Finally, non-coding regions were found to have a high probability of TE content within regulatory sequences, most notably in repressors. Our exhaustive analysis has extended and updated our understanding of TEs in terms of their global impact on gene regulation, and suggests that the most recently derived types of TEs, i.e. clade or species specific SINES, have the greatest overall impact on gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Rodents lick to consume fluids. The reward value of ingested fluids is likely to be encoded by neuronal activity entrained to the lick cycle. Here, we investigated relationships between licking and reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex [MFC], a key cortical region for reward-guided learning and decision-making. Multi-electrode recordings of spike activity and field potentials were made in male rats as they performed an incentive contrast licking task. Rats received access to higher and lower value sucrose rewards over alternating 30 sec periods. They learned to lick persistently when higher value rewards were available and to suppress licking when lower value rewards were available. Spectral analysis of spikes and fields revealed evidence for reward value being encoded by the strength of phase-locking of a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm to the rats lick cycle. Recordings during the initial acquisition of the task found that the strength of phase-locking to the lick cycle was strengthened with experience. A modification of the task, with a temporal gap of 2 sec added between reward deliveries, found that the rhythmic signals persisted during periods of dry licking, a finding that suggests the MFC encodes either the value of the currently available reward or the vigor with which rats act to consume it. Finally, we found that reversible inactivations of the MFC in the opposite hemisphere eliminated the encoding of reward information. Together, our findings establish that a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm, generated by the rodent medial frontal cortex, is synchronized to rewarded actions.\\n\\nSignificance StatementThe cellular and behavioral mechanisms of reward signaling by the medial frontal cortex [MFC] have not been resolved. We report evidence for a 6-12 Hz theta rhythm that is generated by the MFC and synchronized with ongoing consummatory actions. Previous studies of MFC reward signaling have inferred value coding upon temporally sustained activity during the period of reward consumption. Our findings suggest that MFC activity is temporally sustained due to the consumption of the rewarding fluids, and not necessarily the abstract properties of the rewarding fluid. Two other major findings were that the MFC reward signals persist beyond the period of fluid delivery and are generated by neurons within the MFC.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous fungi produce a diverse array of secondary metabolites (SMs) critical for defense, virulence, and communication. The metabolic pathways that produce SMs are found in contiguous gene clusters in fungal genomes, an atypical arrangement for metabolic pathways in other eukaryotes. Comparative studies of filamentous fungal species have shown that SM gene clusters are often either highly divergent or uniquely present in one or a handful of species, hampering efforts to determine the genetic basis and evolutionary drivers of SM gene cluster divergence. Here we examined SM variation in 66 cosmopolitan strains of a single species, the opportunistic human pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Investigation of genome-wide within-species variation revealed five general types of variation in SM gene clusters: non-functional gene polymorphisms, gene gain and loss polymorphisms, whole cluster gain and loss polymorphisms, allelic polymorphisms where different alleles corresponded to distinct, non-homologous clusters, and location polymorphisms in which a cluster was found to differ in its genomic location across strains. These polymorphisms affect the function of representative A. fumigatus SM gene clusters, such as those involved in the production of gliotoxin, fumigaclavine, and helvolic acid, as well as the function of clusters with undefined products. In addition to enabling the identification of polymorphisms whose detection requires extensive genome-wide synteny conservation (e.g., mobile gene clusters and non-homologous cluster alleles), our approach also implicated multiple underlying genetic drivers, including point mutations, recombination, genomic deletion and insertion events, as well as horizontal gene transfer from distant fungi. Finally, most of the variants that we uncover within A. fumigatus have been previously hypothesized to contribute to SM gene cluster diversity across entire fungal classes and phyla. We suggest that the drivers of genetic diversity operating within a fungal species shown here are sufficient to explain SM cluster macroevolutionary patterns.",

    "abstract": "RNA is secreted from cells enclosed within extracellular vesicles (EVs). Defining the RNA composition of EVs is challenging due to their co-isolation with contaminants, a lack of knowledge of the mechanisms of RNA sorting into EVs and limitations of conventional RNA-seq methods. Here we present our observations using thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase sequencing (TGIRT-seq) to characterize the RNA extracted from HEK293T cell EVs isolated by flotation gradient ultracentrifugation and from exosomes containing the tetraspannin CD63 further purified from the gradient fractions by immunoisolation. We found that EV-associated transcripts are dominated by full-length, mature tRNAs and other small non-coding RNAs encapsulated within vesicles. A substantial proportion of the reads mapping to protein-coding genes, long non-coding, and antisense RNAs were due to DNA contamination on the surface of vesicles. Nevertheless, sequences mapping to spliced mRNAs were identified within HEK293T cell EVs and exosomes, among the most abundant being transcripts containing a 5 terminal oligopyrimidine (5 TOP) motif. Our results indicate that the RNA-binding protein YBX1, which we showed previously is required for the sorting of selected miRNAs into exosomes, plays a role in the sorting of highly abundant small non-coding RNA species, including tRNAs, Y RNAs, and Vault RNAs. Finally, we obtained evidence for an EV-specific tRNA modification, perhaps indicating a role for post-transcriptional modification in the sorting of some RNA species into EVs. The identification of full-length small non-coding RNAs within EVs suggests a role for EVs in the export and possible intercellular functional transfer of abundant cellular transcripts.\\n\\nStatement of SignificanceCells release vesicles containing selectively packaged cargo, including RNA, into the extracellular environment. Prior studies have identified RNA inside extracellular vesicles (EVs) but, due to limitations of conventional sequencing methods, highly structured and post-transcriptionally modified RNA species were not effectively captured. Using an alternative sequencing approach (TGIRT-seq), we found that EVs contain abundant small non-coding RNA species, including full-length tRNAs and Y RNAs. Using a knockout cell line, we obtained evidence that the RNA-binding protein YBX1 plays a role in sorting small non-coding RNAs into a subpopulation of extracellular vesicles termed exosomes. These experiments expand our understanding of EV-RNA composition and provide insights into how RNA is sorted into EVs for export from the cell.",

These partitions define the possible transmission trees that are consistent with a given phylogenetic tree. However, the mathematical properties of the transmission trees given a phylogeny remain largely unexplored. Here, we describe a procedure to calculate the number of possible transmission trees for a given phylogeny, and we show how to uniformly sample from these transmission trees. The procedure is outlined for situations where one sample is available from each host and trees do not have branch lengths, and we also provide extensions for incomplete sampling, multiple sampling, and the application to time trees in a situation where limits on the period during which each host could have been infected are known.

Increased prevalence, infection intensity, and spread of human schistosomiasis to non-endemic areas has been consistently linked with water resource management related to agricultural expansion, such as dam construction, which has resulted in increased snail habitat1,4-6. However, the role of agrochemical pollution in human schistosome transmission remains unexplored, despite strong evidence of agrochemicals increasing snail-borne diseases of wildlife7-9 and a projected 2- to 5-fold increase in global agrochemical use by 205010 that will disproportionately occur in schistosome-endemic regions. Using a field mesocosm experiment, we show that environmentally relevant concentrations of fertilizer, the common herbicide atrazine, and the common insecticide chlorpyrifos, individually and as mixtures, increase densities of schistosome-infected snails by increasing the algae snails eat (fertilizer and atrazine) and decreasing densities of snail predators (chlorpyrifos). Epidemiological models indicate that these agrochemical effects can increase transmission of schistosomiasis. Hence, the rapid agricultural changes occurring in schistosome-endemic regions11,12 that are driving increased agrochemical use and pollution could potentially increase the burden of schistosomiasis in these areas. Identifying agricultural practices or agrochemicals that minimize disease risk will be critical to meeting growing food demands while improving human wellbeing13,14.",

Using cross-sectional data from participants with ASD (n=393) and TD controls (n=496) across 15 sites we tested: 1) effect of diagnosis and age on the variability of intrinsic network locations and 2) whether prior findings of functional connectivity differences in ASD as compared to TD remain after PINT application.\\n\\nResultsWe found greater variability in the spatial locations of resting state networks within individuals with ASD as compared to TD. In TD participants, variability decreased from childhood into adulthood, and increased again in late-life, following a  U-shaped pattern, which was not present in those with ASD. Comparison of intrinsic connectivity between groups revealed that the application of PINT decreased the number of hypo-connected regions in ASD.\\n\\nConclusionsOur results provide a new framework for measuring altered brain functioning in neurodevelopmental disorders that may have implications for tracking developmental course, phenotypic heterogeneity, and ultimately treatment response.

    "abstract": "BST-2/tetherin is a human extracellular transmembrane protein that serves as a host defense factor against HIV-1 and other viruses by inhibiting viral spreading. Structurally, BST-2 is a homodimeric coiled-coil that is connected to the host cell membrane by N and C terminal transmembrane anchors. The C-terminal membrane anchor of BST-2 is inserted into the budding virus while the N-terminal membrane anchor remains in the host cell membrane creating a viral tether. The structural mechanism of viral budding and tethering as mediated by BST-2 is not clear. To more fully describe the mechanism of viral tethering, we created a model of BST-2 embedded in a membrane and used steered molecular dynamics to simulate the transition from the host cell membrane associated BST-2 and the cell-virus membrane bridging form. We observed that BST-2 did not transition as a rigid structure, but instead bent at sites with a reduced interface between the helices of the coiled-coil. The simulations for the human BST-2 were then compared with simulations on the mouse homolog, which has a more stable coiled-coil. We observed that the mouse homolog spread the bending across the ectodomain, rather than breaking at discrete points as observed with the human homolog. These simulations support previous biochemical and cellular work suggesting some flexibility in the coiled-coil is necessary for viral tethering, while also highlighting how subtle changes in protein sequence can influence the dynamics and stability of proteins with overall similar structure.",

However, this paradigm poorly accounts for samples whose composition is a mixture of cluster-characterizing ones, and therefore lie in-between them in cluster space. This paper addresses unsupervised learning of 2-way clusters. It defines a mixture model that allows 2-way cluster assignment and describes a variant of generalized k-means for learning such a model.

    "abstract": "Obesity is epidemic worldwide as the results of excessive energy intake or inefficient energy expenditure. It is promising to utilize the thermogenic function of brown adipose tissue for obesity intervention. However, the mechanisms controlling the efficacy of norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis in brown adipocytes remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the proton ATPase activity of mitochondrial complex V is a key factor, which antagonizes proton leak by UCP1 and determines the efficacy of norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Furthermore, to avoid unnecessary and undesired heat production, we reveal that ATP as a sympathetic cotransmitter is necessary for the high efficacy and specificity of norepinephrine-induced thermogenesis in brown adipocytes by upregulating the ATP synthase activity of complex V. Thus, we demonstrate the modulation mechanism of thermogenic efficacy in brown adipocytes. These findings imply new strategies for efficiently utilizing brown adipocytes thermogenic capacity, and therapeutic targets for the treatments of obesity and diabetes.\\n\\nHighlights1.

    "abstract": "Stable coexistence relies on negative frequency-dependence, in which rarer species invading a patch benefit from a lack of conspecific competition experienced by residents. In nature, however, rarity can have costs, resulting in positive frequency-dependence (PFD) particularly when species are rare. Many processes can cause positive frequency-dependence, including a lack of mates, mutualist interactions, and reproductive interference from heterospecifics. When species become rare in the community, positive frequency-dependence creates vulnerability to extinction, if frequencies drop below certain thresholds. For example, environmental fluctuations can drive species to low frequencies where they are then vulnerable to PFD. Here, we analyze deterministic and stochastic mathematical models of two species interacting through both PFD and resource competition in a Chessonian framework. Reproductive success of individuals in these models is reduced by a product of two terms: the reduction in fecundity due to PFD, and the reduction in fecundity due to competition. Consistent with classical coexistence theory, the effect of competition on individual reproductive success exhibits negative frequency-dependence when individuals experience greater intraspecific competition than interspecific competition i.e., niche overlap is less than one. In the absence of environmental fluctuations, our analysis reveals that (1) a synergistic effect of PFD and niche overlap that hastens exclusion, (2) trade-offs between susceptibility to PFD and maximal fecundity can mediate coexistence, and (3) coexistence, when it occurs, requires that neither species is initially rare. Analysis of the stochastic model highlights that environmental fluctuations, unless perfectly correlated, coupled with PFD ultimately drive one species extinct. Over any given time frame, this extinction risk decreases with the correlation of the demographic responses of the two species to the environmental fluctuations, and increases with the temporal autocorrelation of these fluctuations. For species with overlapping generations, these trends in extinction risk persist despite the strength of the storage effect decreasing with correlated demographic responses and increasing with temporal autocorrelations. These results highlight how the presence of PFD may alter the outcomes predicted by modern coexistence mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a global health issue. Dietary methyl donor restriction is used to induce a NAFLD/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) phenotype in rodents, however the extent to which this model reflects human NAFLD remains incompletely understood. To address this, we undertook hepatic transcriptional profiling of methyl donor restricted rodents and compared these to published human NAFLD datasets.\\n\\nAdult C57BL/6J mice were maintained on control, choline deficient (CDD) or methionine/choline deficient (MCDD) diets for four weeks; the effects on methyl donor and lipid biology were investigated by bioinformatic analysis of hepatic gene expression profiles followed by a cross-species comparison with human expression data of all stages of NAFLD.\\n\\nCompared to controls, expression of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) packaging carboxylesterases (Ces1d, Ces1f, Ces3b) and the NAFLD risk allele Pnpla3 were suppressed in MCDD; with Pnpla3 and the liver predominant Ces isoform, Ces3b, also suppressed in CDD. With respect to 1-carbon metabolism, down-regulation of Chka, Chkb, Pcty1a, Gnmt and Ahcy with concurrent upregulation of Mat2a suggests a drive to maintain S-adenosylmethionine levels. There was minimal similarity between global gene expression patterns in either dietary intervention and any stage of human NAFLD, however some common transcriptomic changes in inflammatory, fibrotic and proliferative mediators were identified in MCDD, NASH and HCC.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this study suggests suppression of VLDL assembly machinery may contribute to hepatic lipid accumulation in these models, but that CDD and MCDD rodent diets are minimally representative of human NAFLD at the transcriptional level.\\n\\nSummary statementWe used transcriptional profiling of methyl donor restricted rodents to examine effects on methyl donor and lipid biology. We report novel mechanisms for lipid accumulation in this model and describe significant disparity between both dietary interventions and human disease.",

    "abstract": "Acto-myosin contractility is an essential element of many aspects of cellular biology, and manifests as traction forces that cells exert on their surroundings. The central role of these forces makes them a novel principal therapeutic target in diverse diseases. This requires accurate and higher capacity measurements of traction forces; however, existing methods are largely low throughput, limiting their utility in broader applications. To address this need, we employ Fourier-transform traction force microscopy in a parallelized 96-well format, which we refer to as contractile force screening (CFS).Critically, rather than the frequently employed hydrogel polyacrylamide (PAA), we fabricate these plates using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) rubber. Key to this approach is that the PDMS used is very compliant, with a lower-bound Youngs modulus of approximately 0.7 kPa. We subdivide these monolithic substrates spatially into biochemically independent wells, creating a uniform multiwell platform for traction force screening. We demonstrate the utility and versatility of this platform by quantifying the compound and dose-dependent contractility responses of human airway smooth muscle cells and retinal pigment epithelial cells.",

    "abstract": "Although essential for many cellular processes, the sequence of structural and molecular events during clathrin-mediated endocytosis remains elusive. While it was believed that clathrin-coated pits grow with a constant curvature, it was recently suggested that clathrin first assembles to form a flat structure and then bends while maintaining a constant surface area. Here, we combine correlative electron and light microscopy and mathematical modelling to quantify the sequence of ultrastructural rearrangements of the clathrin coat during endocytosis in mammalian cells. We confirm that clathrin-coated structures can initially grow flat and that lattice curvature does not show a direct correlation with clathrin coat assembly. We demonstrate that curvature begins when 70% of the final clathrin content is acquired. We find that this transition is marked by a change in the clathrin to clathrin-adaptor protein AP2 ratio and that membrane tension suppresses this transition. Our results support the model that mammalian cells dynamically regulate the flat-to-curved transition in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by both biochemical and mechanical factors.",

    "abstract": "Student microbial ecology laboratory courses are often conducted as condensed courses in which theory and wet lab work are combined in a very intensive short time period. In last decades, the study of marine microbial ecology is increasingly reliant on molecular-based methods, and as a result many of the research projects conducted in such courses require sequencing that is often not available on site and may take more time than a typical course allows. In this work, we describe a protocol combining molecular and functional methods for analyzing proteorhodopsins (PRs), with visible results in only 4-5 days, that do not rely on sequencing. PRs were discovered in oceanic surface waters two decades ago, and have since been observed in different marine environments and diverse taxa, including the abundant alphaproteobacterial SAR11 group. PR subgroups are currently known to absorb green and blue light, and their distribution was previously explained by prevailing light conditions - green pigments at the surface and blue pigments in deeper waters, as blue light travels deeper in the water column. To detect PR in environmental samples, we created a chimeric plasmid suitable for direct expression of PRs using PCR amplification and functional analysis in Escherichia coli cells. Using this assay, we discovered several exceptional cases of PRs whose phenotypes differed from those predicted based on sequence only, including a previously undescribed yellow-light absorbing PRs. We applied this assay in two 10-days marine microbiology courses and found it to greatly enhance students laboratory experience, enabling them to gain rapid visual feedback and colorful reward for their work. Furthermore we expect this assay to promote the use of functional assays for the discovery of new rhodopsin variants.",

Results showed a clear deficit in the non-symbolic magnitude representations in parietal, temporal, and frontal regions in dyscalculia. We also observed hyper-connectivity in visual brain regions and increased grey matter volume in the default mode network in adults with dyscalculia. Hence, dyscalculia is related to a combination of diverse neural markers which are altogether distributed across a substantial portion of cerebral cortex, supporting a multifactorial model of this neurodevelopmental disorder.",

They have species-specific temperatures below which movements become uncoordinated prior to entering a reversible state of neuromuscular paralysis. In spite of decades of research, which in recent years has focused on muscle function, the role of neural mechanisms in detemining chill coma is unknown. Spreading depolarization (SD) is a phenomenon that causes a shutdown of neural function in the integrating centres of the central nervous system. We investigated the role of SD in the process of entering chill coma in the locust, Locusta migratoria. We used thermolimit respirometry and electromyography in whole animals and extracellular and intracellular recording techniques in semi-intact preparations to characterize neural events during chilling. We show that chill-induced SD in the central nervous system is the mechanism underlying the critical thermal minimum for coordinated movement in locusts. This finding will be important for understanding how insects adapt and acclimate to changing environmental temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Genetic code expansion enables the incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) into expressed proteins. ncAAs are usually encoded by a stop codon that is decoded by an exogenous orthogonal aminoacyl tRNA synthetase and its cognate suppressor tRNA, such as the pyrrolysine synthetase/[Formula] pair. In such systems, stop codon suppression is dependent on the intracellular levels of the exogenous tRNA. Therefore, multiple copies of the tRNAPyl gene (PylT) are encoded to improve ncAA incorporation. However, certain applications in mammalian cells, such as live-cell imaging applications, where labelled tRNA contributes to background fluorescence, can benefit from the use of less invasive minimal expression systems. Accordingly, we studied the effect of tRNAPyl on live-cell fluorescence imaging of bioorthogonally-labelled intracellular proteins. We found that in COS7 cells, a decrease in PylT copy numbers had no measurable effect on protein expression levels. Importantly, reducing PylT copy numbers improved the quality of live-cells images by enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio and reducing an immobile tRNAPyl population. This enabled us to improve live cell imaging of bioorthogonally labelled intracellular proteins, and to simultaneously label two different proteins in a cell. Our results indicate that the number of introduced PylT genes can be minimized according to the transfected cell line, incorporated ncAA, and application.",

Here, we use whole-genome sequencing of 2,778 tumour samples from 2,658 donors to reconstruct the life history, evolution of mutational processes, and driver mutation sequences of 39 cancer types. The early phases of oncogenesis are driven by point mutations in a small set of driver genes, often including biallelic inactivation of tumour suppressors. Early oncogenesis is also characterised by specific copy number gains, such as trisomy 7 in glioblastoma or isochromosome 17q in medulloblastoma. By contrast, increased genomic instability, a nearly four-fold diversification of driver genes, and an acceleration of point mutation processes are features of later stages. Copy-number alterations often occur in mitotic crises leading to simultaneous gains of multiple chromosomal segments. Timing analysis suggests that driver mutations often precede diagnosis by many years, and in some cases decades, providing a window of opportunity for early cancer detection.",

    "abstract": "Southern Angola is a poorly studied region, inhabited by populations that have been associated with different migratory movements into southern Africa. Besides the long-standing presence of indigenous Kxa-speaking foragers and the more recent arrival of Bantu-speaking pastoralists, ethnographic and linguistic studies have suggested that other pre-Bantu communities were also present in the Namib desert, including peripatetic groups like the Kwepe (formerly Kwadi speakers), Twa and Kwisi. Here we evaluate previous peopling hypotheses by analyzing the relationships between seven groups from the Namib desert (Kuvale, Himba, Tjimba, Kwisi, Twa, Kwepe) and Kunene Province (!Xun), based on newly collected linguistic data and 295 complete mtDNA genomes. We found that: i) all groups from the Namib desert have genealogically-consistent matriclanic systems that had a strong impact on their maternal genetic structure by enhancing genetic drift and population differentiation; ii) the dominant pastoral groups represented by the Kuvale and Himba were part of a Bantu proto-population that also included the ancestors of present-day Damara and Herero peoples from Namibia; iii) Tjimba are closely related to the Himba; iv) the Kwepe, Twa and Kwisi have a divergent Bantu-related mtDNA profile and probably stem from a single population that does not show clear signs of being a pre-Bantu indigenous group. Taken together, our results suggest that the maternal genetic structure of the different groups from the Namib desert is largely derived from endogamous Bantu peoples, and that their social stratification and different subsistence patterns are not indicative of remnant groups, but reflect Bantu-internal variation and ethnogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic gene drive systems possess enormous potential to replace, alter, or suppress wild populations of significant disease vectors and crop pests; however, their utility in diverse populations remains to be demonstrated. Here, we report the creation of the first-ever synthetic Medea gene drive element in a major worldwide crop pest, D. suzukii. We demonstrate that this drive element, based on an engineered maternal \\\"toxin\\\" coupled with a linked embryonic \\\"antidote,\\\" is capable of biasing Mendelian inheritance rates with up to 100% efficiency. However, we find that drive resistance, resulting from naturally occurring genetic variation and associated fitness costs, can hinder the spread of such an element. Despite this, our results suggest that this element could maintain itself at high frequencies in a wild population, and spread to fixation, if either its fitness costs or toxin resistance were reduced, providing a clear path forward for developing future such systems.",

    "abstract": "Ethnopharmacological RelevanceGastrointestinal anthrax, a disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, remains an important but relatively neglected endemic disease of animals and humans in remote areas of the Indian subcontinent and some parts of Africa. Its initial symptoms include diarrhea and stomachache. In the current study, several common plants indicated for diarrhea, dysentery, stomachache or as stomachic as per traditional knowledge in the Indian subcontinent, i.e., Aegle marmelos (L.) Correa (Bael), Allium cepa L. (Onion), Allium sativum L. (Garlic), Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (Neem), Berberis asiatica Roxb. ex DC. (Daruharidra), Coriandrum sativum L. (Coriander), Curcuma longa L. (Turmeric), Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (Bermuda grass), Mangifera indica L. (Mango), Morus indica L. (Black mulberry), Ocimum tenuiflorum L. (Ocimum sanctum L., Holy Basil), Ocimum gratissimum L. (Ram Tulsi), Psidium guajava L. (Guava), Zingiber officinale Roscoe (Ginger), were evaluated for their anti-Bacillus anthracis property. The usage of Azadirachta indica A. Juss. and Curcuma longa L. by Santals (India), and Allium sp. by biblical people to alleviate anthrax-like symptoms is well documented, but the usage of other plants is traditionally only indicated for different gastrointestinal disturbances/conditions.\n\nAim of the StudyEvaluate the above listed commonly available edible plants from the Indian subcontinent that are used in the traditional medicine to treat gastrointestinal diseases including those also indicated for anthrax-like symptoms for the presence of potent anti-B. anthracis activity in a form amenable to use by the general population in the endemic areas.\n\nMaterials and MethodsAqueous extracts made from fourteen plants indicated above were screened for their anti-B. anthracis activity using agar-well diffusion assay (AWDA) and broth microdilution methods. The Aqueous Garlic Extract (AGE) that displayed most potent anti-B. anthracis activity was assessed for its thermostability, stability under pH extremes encountered in the gastrointestinal tract, and potential antagonistic interaction with bile salts as well as the FDA-approved antibiotics used for anthrax control. The bioactive fractions from the AGE were isolated by TLC coupled bioautography followed by their characterization using GC-MS.\n\nResultsGarlic (Allium sativum L.) extract was identified as the most promising candidate with bactericidal activity against B. anthracis. It consistently inhibited the growth of B. anthracis in AWDA and decreased the viable colony-forming unit counts in liquid-broth cultures by 6-logs within 6-12 h. The AGE displayed acceptable thermostability (>80% anti-B. anthracis activity retained on incubation at 50{degrees}C for 12 h) and stability in gastric pH range (2-8). It did not antagonize the activity of FDA-approved antibiotics used for anthrax control. GC-MS analysis of the TLC separated bioactive fractions of AGE indicated the presence of previously unreported constituents such as phthalic acid derivatives, acid esters, phenyl group-containing compounds, steroids etc.\n\nConclusionThe Aqueous Garlic Extract (AGE) displayed potent anti-B. anthracis activity. It was better than that displayed by Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (Neem) and Mangifera indica L. while Curcuma longa L. (Turmeric) did not show any activity under the assay conditions used. Further work should be undertaken to explore the possible application of AGE in preventing anthrax incidences in endemic areas.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/162214v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@682faaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@114d64org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1efe980org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1caea0f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Local depth variation is a distinctive property of natural scenes and its effects on perception have only recently begun to be investigated. Here, we demonstrate how natural depth variation impacts performance in two fundamental tasks related to stereopsis: half-occlusion detection and disparity detection. We report the results of a computational study that uses a large database of calibrated natural stereo-images with precisely co-registered laser-based distance measurements. First, we develop a procedure for precisely sampling stereo-image patches from the stereo-images, based on the distance measurements. The local depth variation in each stereo-image patch is quantified by disparity contrast. Next, we show that increased disparity contrast degrades performance in half-occlusion detection and disparity detection tasks, and changes the size and shape of the optimal spatial integration areas (\\\"receptive fields\\\") for computing the task-relevant decision variables. Then, we show that a simple binocular image statistic predicts disparity contrast in natural scenes. Finally, we report results on the most likely patterns of disparity variation in natural scenes. Our findings motivate computational and psychophysical investigations of the mechanisms that underlie disparity estimation in local regions of natural scenes.",

    "abstract": "Molecular modelling is routinely employed to assign 3D structures to collision cross sections (CCSs) derived from ion mobility mass spectrometry experiments (IM-MS). The assignment of model structures to the experimental CCSs remains an ambiguous task, where one of several methods may be used to obtain a CCS from a given set of coordinates. The most reliable of the commonly used techniques, the Trajectory Method, starts with atomic coordinates which can be accompanied by partial atomic charges, obtained using ab initio methods. Here, we use lithiated - and {beta}-glucose ions as exemplar molecules to detect the effect conformational modification and changes to the partial charge distribution have on computed collision cross sections. Six popular charge schemes (Mulliken, APT, CHelpG, MK, HLY and NPA) were examined in combination with three functionals (Hartree-Fock, B3LYP and M05) and five basis sets (STO-3G, 3-21G, 6-31G, 6-31+G and 6-31G*) on twenty unique structures. Our findings indicate that molecular conformation makes a significant contribution to fluctuations of partial charges in Electrostatic Potential (ESP) and Mulliken charge scheme; Partial charges derived using Natural Population Analysis (NPA) and ESP methods are largely independent of functional and basis set selection; and both selection of the charge scheme and functional/basis set combination play a large role in the resultant CCS, often causing few percent fluctuations in the computed values.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin fold modifier 1 (Ufm1) is a ubiquitin-like protein (UBL) found in eukaryotic organisms which plays a crucial role in ER stress management and signal transduction. The crystal structure of UFM1 and its E1 (Uba5) in complex shows that Ufm1 binds to the adenylation domain of UBA5 and interacts with a separate Ufm1-interacting sequence (UIS) in the C-terminus of UBA5. The UIS interacts with Ufm1 on the opposite side of Ufm1 protein from the adenylation domain of Uba5 and the reason for this second interaction site is unclear. We analyzed Ufm1 bound to the UIS sequence through molecular dynamics simulations in order to identify additional functions for this interaction. We found that the residues in the adenylation interaction site of Ufm1 have less movement when the UIS peptide was bound to Ufm1 and formed a structure that aligns well with Ufm1 bound to the Uba5 adenylation domain. We further identified an amino acid that connects the UIS to the adenylation domain interacting site. Mutation of this amino acid decreases charging activity and shifts the Ufm1 conformation population toward the unlocked configuration even in the presence of the UIS peptide. These data suggest a role for the Uba5 UIS in stimulating activation of Ufm1.",

Using theory, experiments and simulation, we investigated how physiologically relevant cell shape changes affect subcellular organization, and consequently intracellular signaling, to control information flow needed for phenotypic function. Vascular smooth muscle cells going from a proliferative and motile circular shape to a contractile fusiform shape show changes in the location of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, inter-organelle distances and differential distribution of receptors in the plasma membrane. These factors together lead to the modulation of signals transduced by the M3 muscarinic receptor/Gq/PLC{beta} pathway at the plasma membrane, amplifying Ca2+ dynamics in the cytoplasm and the nucleus resulting in phenotypic changes, as determined by increased activity of myosin light chain kinase in the cytoplasm and enhanced nuclear localization of the transcription factor NFAT. Taken together, our observations show a systems level phenomenon whereby global cell shape affects subcellular organization to modulate signaling that enables phenotypic changes.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial organs undergo steady-state turnover throughout adult life, with old cells being continually replaced by the progeny of stem cell divisions1. To avoid hyperplasia or atrophy, organ turnover demands strict equilibration of cell production and loss2-4. However, the mechanistic basis of this equilibrium is unknown. Using the adult Drosophila intestine5, we find that robustly precise turnover arises through a coupling mechanism in which enterocyte apoptosis breaks feedback inhibition of stem cell divisions. Healthy enterocytes inhibit stem cell division through E-cadherin, which prevents secretion of mitogenic EGFs by repressing transcription of the EGF maturation factor rhomboid. Individual apoptotic enterocytes promote divisions by loss of E-cadherin, which releases cadherin-associated {beta}-catenin/Armadillo and p120-catenin to induce rhomboid. Induction of rhomboid in the dying enterocyte triggers EGFR activation in stem cells within a discrete radius. When we block apoptosis, E-cadherin-controlled feedback suppresses divisions, and the organ retains the same number of cells. When we disrupt feedback, apoptosis and divisions are uncoupled, and the organ develops either hyperplasia or atrophy. Altogether, our work demonstrates that robust cellular balance hinges on the obligate coupling of divisions to apoptosis, which limits the proliferative potential of a stem cell to the precise time and place that a replacement cell is needed. In this manner, localized cell-cell communication gives rise to tissue-level homeostatic equilibrium and constant organ size.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the relative influence of various abiotic and biotic variables on diversification dynamics is a major goal of macroevolutionary studies. Recently, phylogenetic approaches have been developed that make it possible to estimate the role of various environmental variables on diversification using time-calibrated species trees, paleoenvironmental data, and maximum-likelihood techniques. These approaches have been effectively employed to estimate how speciation and extinction rates vary with key abiotic variables, such as temperature and sea level, and we can anticipate that they will be increasingly used in the future. Here we compile a series of biotic and abiotic paleodatasets that can be used as explanatory variables in these models and use simulations to assess the statistical properties of the approach when applied to these paleodatasets. We demonstrate that environment-dependent models perform well in recovering environment-dependent speciation and extinction parameters, as well as in correctly identifying the simulated environmental model when speciation isenvironment-dependent. We explore how the strength of the environment-dependency, tree size, missing taxa, and characteristics of the paleoenvironmental curves influence the performance of the models. Finally, using these models, we infer environment-dependent diversification in three empirical phylogenies: temperature-dependence in Cetacea,{delta} 13C-dependence in Ruminantia, and CO2-dependence in Portulacaceae. We illustrate how to evaluate the relative importance of abiotic and biotic variables in these three clades and interpret these results in light of macroevolutionary hypotheses for mammals and plants. Given the important role paleoenvironments are presumed to have played in species evolution, our statistical assessment of how environment-dependent models behave is crucial for their utility in macroevolutionary analysis.",

    "abstract": "The sexes perform different reproductive roles and have evolved sometimes strikingly different phenotypes. One focal point of adaptive divergence occurs in the context of diet and metabolism, and males and females of a range of species have been shown to require different nutrients to maximise their fitness. Biochemical analyses in Drosophila melanogaster have confirmed that dimorphism in dietary requirements is associated with molecular sex-differences in metabolite titres. In addition, they also showed significant within-sex genetic variation in the metabolome. To date however, it is unknown whether this metabolic variation translates into differences in reproductive fitness. The answer to this question is crucial to establish whether genetic variation is selectively neutral or indicative of constraints on sex-specific physiological adaptation and optimisation. Here we assay genetic variation in consumption and metabolic fitness effects by screening male and female fitness of thirty D. melanogaster genotypes across four protein-to-carbohydrate ratios. In addition to confirming sexual dimorphism in consumption and fitness, we find significant genetic variation in male and female dietary requirements. Importantly, these differences are not explained by feeding responses and most likely reflect metabolic variation that, in turn, suggest the presence of genetic constraints on metabolic dimorphism.",

However, mitochondria-to-nucleus communication pathways are incompletely understood. Here, we identify G-Protein Pathway Suppressor 2 (GPS2) as a mediator of mitochondrial retrograde signaling and a key transcriptional activator of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes in mammals. GPS2 regulated translocation from mitochondria to nucleus is essential for the transcriptional activation of the nuclear stress response to mitochondrial depolarization and for supporting basal mitochondrial biogenesis in differentiating adipocytes and in brown adipose tissue from mice. In the nucleus, GPS2 recruitment to target gene promoters regulates histone H3K9 demethylation and RNA Polymerase II (POL2) activation through inhibition of Ubc13-mediated ubiquitination. Together, these findings reveal an unexpected layer of regulation of mitochondrial gene transcription as they uncover a novel mitochondria-nuclear communication pathway.",
