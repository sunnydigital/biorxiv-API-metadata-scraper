    "abstract": "The social hymenoptera are emerging as models for epigenetics. DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group, is a common epigenetic marker. In mammals and flowering plants methylation affects allele specific expression. There is contradictory evidence for the role of methylation on allele specific expression in social insects. The aim of this paper is to investigate allele specific expression and monoallelic methylation in the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris. We found nineteen genes that were both monoallelically methylated and monoallelically expressed in a single bee. Fourteen of these genes express the hypermethylated allele, while the other five express the hypomethylated allele. We also searched for allele specific expression in twenty-nine published RNA-seq libraries. We found 555 loci with allele-specific expression. We discuss our results with reference to the functional role of methylation in gene expression in insects and in the, as yet unquantified, role of genetic cis effects in insect allele specific methylation and expression.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, several large-scale whole-genome projects sequencing tens of thousands of individuals were completed, with larger studies are underway. These projects aim to provide high-quality genotypes for a large number of whole genomes in a cost-efficient manner, by sequencing each genome at low coverage and subsequently identifying alleles jointly in the entire cohort. Here we present Ref-Reveel, a novel method for large-scale population genotyping. We show that Ref-Reveel provides genotyping at a higher accuracy and higher efficiency in comparison to existing methods by applying our method to one of the largest whole-genome sequencing datasets presently available to the public. We further show that utilizing the resulting genotype panel as references, through the Ref-Reveel framework, greatly improves the ability to call genotypes accurately on newly sequenced genomes. In addition, we present a Ref-Reveel pipeline that is applicable for genotyping of very small datasets. In summary, Ref-Reveel is an accurate, scalable and applicable method for a wide range of genotyping scenarios, and will greatly improves the quality of calling genomic alterations in current and future large-scale sequencing projects.",

    "abstract": "Although all human tissues carry out common processes, tissues are distinguished by gene expres-sion patterns, implying that distinct regulatory programs control tissue-specificity. In this study, we investigate gene expression and regulation across 38 tissues profiled in the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. We find that network edges (transcription factor to target gene connections) have higher tissue-specificity than network nodes (genes) and that regulating nodes (transcription factors) are less likely to be expressed in a tissue-specific manner as compared to their targets (genes). Gene set enrichment analysis of network targeting also indicates that regulation of tissue-specific function is largely independent of transcription factor expression. In addition, tissue-specific genes are not highly targeted in their corresponding tissue-network. However, they do assume bottleneck positions due to variability in transcription factor targeting and the influence of non-canonical regulatory interactions. These results suggest that tissue-specificity is driven by context-dependent regulatory paths, providing transcriptional control of tissue-specific processes.",

    "abstract": "Export of parasite proteins into the host erythrocyte is essential for survival of Plasmodium falciparum during its asexual lifecycle. While several studies described key factors within the parasite that are involved in protein export, the mechanisms employed to traffic exported proteins within the host cell are currently unknown. Members of the Hsp70 family of chaperones, together with their Hsp40 co-chaperones, facilitate protein trafficking in other organisms, and are thus likely used by P. falciparum in the trafficking of its exported proteins. A large group of Hsp40 proteins is encoded by the parasite and exported to the host cell, but only one Hsp70, PfHsp70x, is exported with them.\\n\\nPfHsp70x is absent from most Plasmodium species and is found only in P. falciparum and closely-related species that infect Apes. Herein, we have utilized CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing in P. falciparum to investigate the essentiality of PfHsp70x. We show that parasitic growth was unaffected by knockdown of PfHsp70x using both the DHFR-based Destabilization Domain and the glmS ribozyme system. Similarly, a complete gene knockout of PfHsp70x did not affect the ability of P. falciparum to proceed through its intraerythrocytic lifecycle. The effect of PfHsp70x knockdown/knockout on the export of proteins to the host RBC, including the critical virulence factor PfEMP1, was tested and we found that this process was unaffected. These data show that although PfHsp70x is the sole exported Hsp70, it is not essential for the asexual development of P. falciparum.\\n\\nImportanceHalf of the worlds population lives at risk for malaria. The intraerythrocytic lifecycle of Plasmodium spp. is responsible for clinical manifestations of malaria; therefore, knowledge of the parasites ability to survive within the erythrocyte is needed to combat the deadliest agent of malaria, P. falciparum. An outstanding question in the field is how P. falciparum undertakes the essential process of trafficking its proteins within the host cell. In most organisms, chaperones such as Hsp70 are employed in protein trafficking. Of the human-disease causing Plasmodium species, the chaperone PfHsp70x is unique to P. falciparum, and it is the only parasite protein of its kind exported to the host (1). This has placed PfHsp70x as an ideal target to inhibit protein trafficking and kill the parasite. However, we show that PfHsp70x is not required for export of parasite effectors nor is it essential for parasite survival inside of the RBC.",

In in vitro monolayer cultures as well as in ex vivo eye perfusion cultures, we found that the trabecular meshwork (TM) cells that regulate outflow, form actin stress fibers and have a decreased phagocytosis.

    "abstract": "As a major orchestrator of the cellular epigenome, the repressor element-1 silencing transcription factor (REST) can either repress or activate thousands of genes depending on cellular context, suggesting a highly context-dependent REST function tuned by environmental cues. While REST shows cell-type non-selective active transcription1, an N-terminal REST4 isoform caused by alternative splicing - inclusion of an extra exon (N3c) which introduces a premature stop codon - has been implicated in neurogenesis and tumorigenesis2-5. Recently, in line with established epigenetic regulation of pre-mRNA splicing6,7, we demonstrated that REST undergoes extensive, context-dependent alternative splicing which results in the formation of a large number of mRNA variants predictive of multiple protein isoforms8. Supported by that immunoblotting/-staining with different anti-REST antibodies yield inconsistent results, alternative splicing allows production of various structurally and functionally different REST protein isoforms in response to shifting physiological requirements, providing a reasonable explanation for the diverse, highly context-dependent REST function. However, REST isoforms might be differentially assayed or manipulated, leading to data misinterpretation and controversial findings. For example, in contrast to the proposed neurotoxicity of elevated nuclear REST in ischemia9 and Huntingtons disease10,11, Lu et al. recently reported decreased nuclear REST in Alzheimers disease and neuroprotection of REST in ageing brain12. Unfortunately, alternative REST splicing was largely neglected by Lu et al., making it necessary for a reevaluation of their findings.",

We used a hyper-graph clustering method to identify clusters of orthologous genes co-expressed in both mouse and rat. We validated these clusters by analysing expression profiles in each species separately, and demonstrating a high overlap. We then focused on genes in 18 homology groups with one-to-many or many-to-many relationships between two species, to discriminate between functionally equivalent and non-equivalent orthologs.

However, the causative bacterium (Legionella pneumophila) has an unusual population structure with extreme temporal and spatial genome sequence conservation. Furthermore, Legionnaires disease outbreaks can be caused by multiple L. pneumophila genotypes in a single source. These factors can confound cluster identification using standard phylogenomic methods. Here, we show that a statistical learning approach based on\\n\\nL. pneumophila core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) comparisons eliminates ambiguity for defining outbreak clusters and accurately predicts exposure sources for clinical cases. We illustrate the performance of our method by genome comparisons of 234 L. pneumophila isolates obtained from patients and cooling towers in Melbourne, Australia between 1994 and 2014. This collection included one of the largest reported Legionnaires disease outbreaks, involving 125 cases at an aquarium. Using only sequence data from L. pneumophila cooling tower isolates and including all core genome variation, we built a multivariate model using discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) to find cooling tower-specific genomic signatures, and then used it to predict the origin of clinical isolates. Model assignments were 93% congruent with epidemiological data, including the aquarium Legionnaires outbreak and three other unrelated outbreak investigations. We applied the same approach to a recently described investigation of Legionnaires disease within a UK hospital and observed model predictive ability of 86%. We have developed a promising means to breach L. pneumophila genetic diversity extremes and provide objective source attribution data for outbreak investigations.",

Multidimensional scaling of the gene expression data revealed individually different single cell trajectories eventually leading to sporulation.

Structural analyses of the Petri nets indicated stimulus- and genotype-dependence of both, single cell trajectories and of the quasipotential landscape through which these trajectories are taken.

    "abstract": "The immunoglobulin heavy variable (IGHV) and T cell beta variable (TRBV) loci are among the most complex and variable regions in the human genome. Generated through a process of gene duplication/deletion and diversification, these loci can vary extensively between individuals in copy number and contain genes that are highly similar, making their analysis technically challenging. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the functional gene segments in the IGHV and TRBV loci, quantifying their copy number and single nucleotide variation in a globally diverse sample of 109 (IGHV) and 286 (TRBV) humans from over a hundred populations. We find that the IGHV and TRBV gene families exhibit starkly different patterns of variation. In particular, with hundreds of copy number haplotypes (instances that have differences in the number of functional gene segments), the IGHV locus has undergone more frequent gene duplication/deletion compared to the TRBV locus, which has only a few copy number haplotypes. In contrast, the TRBV locus has a greater or at least equal propensity to mutate, as evidenced by greater single nucleotide variation, compared to the IGHV locus. Thus, despite common molecular and functional characteristics, the genes that comprise the IGHV and TRBV loci have evolved in strikingly different ways. As well as providing insight into the different evolutionary paths the IGHV and TRBV loci have taken, our results are also important to the adaptive immune repertoire sequencing community, where the lack of frequencies of common alleles and copy number variants is hampering existing analytical pipelines.",

    "abstract": "During lytic Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection, the viral endonu-clease SOX promotes widespread degradation of cytoplasmic messenger RNA (mRNA). However, select mRNAs, including the transcript encoding interleukin-6 (IL-6), escape SOX-induced cleavage. IL-6 escape is mediated through a 3 UTR RNA regulatory element that overrides the SOX targeting mechanism. Here, we reveal that this protective RNA element functions to broadly restrict cleavage by a range of homologous and non-homologous viral endonucleases. However, it does not impede cleavage by cellular endonucleases. The IL-6 protective sequence may be representative of a larger class of nuclease escape elements, as we identified a similar protective element in the GADD45B mRNA. The IL-6 and GADD45B-derived elements display similarities in their sequence, putative structure, and several associated RNA binding proteins. However, the overall composition of their ribonucleoprotein complexes appears distinct, leading to differences in the breadth of nucleases restricted. These findings highlight how RNA elements can selectively control transcript abundance in the background of widespread virus-induced mRNA degradation.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe ability of viruses to control the host gene expression environment is crucial to promote viral infection. Many viruses express factors that reduce host gene expression through widespread mRNA decay. However, some mRNAs escape this fate, like the transcript encoding the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-6 during KSHV infection. IL-6 escape relies on an RNA regulatory element located in its 3UTR and involves the recruitment of a protective protein complex. Here, we show that this escape extends beyond KSHV to a variety of related and unrelated viral endonucleases. However, the IL-6 element does not protect against cellular endonucleases, revealing for the first time a virus-specific nuclease escape element. We identified a related escape element in the GADD45B mRNA, which displays several similarities with the IL-6 element. However, these elements assemble a largely distinct complex of proteins, leading to differences in the breadth of their protective capacity. Collectively, these findings reveal how a putative new class of RNA elements function to control RNA fate in the background of widespread mRNA degradation by viral endonucleases.",

Increasing the floating-point precision of the calculations allows for increased panel sizes but with a corresponding increase in computation time.

    "abstract": "Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular endosymbiont in fecting many arthropods and filarial nematodes. Little is known about the short-term evolution of Wolbachia or its interaction with its host. Wolbachia is maternally inherited, resulting in co-inheritance of mitochondrial organelles such as mtDNA. Here I explore the short-term evolution of Wolbachia, and the relationship between Wolbachia and mtDNA, using a large inbred panel of Drosophila simulans infected with the Wolbachia strain wRi. I find reduced diversity relative to expectation in both Wolbachia and mtDNA, but only mtDNA shows evidence of a recent selective sweep or population bottleneck. I estimate Wolbachia and mtDNA titre in each genotype, and I find considerable variation in both phenotypes, despite low genetic diversity in Wolbachia and mtDNA. A phylogeny of Wolbachia and of mtDNA show that both trees are largely unresolved, suggesting a recent origin of the infection and a single origin. Using Wolbachia and mtDNA titre as a phenotype, we perform an association analysis with the nuclear genome and find several regions implicated in the phenotype, including one which contains four CAAX-box protein processing genes. CAAX-box protein processing can be an important part of host-pathogen interactions in other systems, suggesting interesting directions for future research.",

Despite variations in sampling behavior, animals must make veridical perceptual judgments about external stimuli. In olfaction, odor sampling varies with respiration, which influences neural responses at the olfactory periphery. Nevertheless, rats were able to perform fine odor intensity judgments despite variations in sniff kinetics. To identify the features of neural activity supporting stable intensity perception, in awake mice we measured responses of Mitral/Tufted (MT) cells to different odors and concentrations across a range of sniff frequencies. Amplitude and latency of the MT cells responses vary with sniff duration. A fluid dynamics (FD) model based on odor concentration kinetics in the intranasal cavity can account for this variability. Eliminating sniff waveform dependence of MT cell responses using the FD model significantly improves concentration decoding.

    "abstract": "This paper describes the sequencing protocol and computational pipeline for the PGV-001 personalized vaccine trial. PGV-001 is a therapeutic peptide vaccine targeting neoantigens identified from patient tumor samples. Peptides are selected by a computational pipeline which identifies mutations from tumor/normal exome sequencing and ranks mutant sequences by a combination of predicted Class I MHC affinity and abundance estimated from tumor RNA. The PGV pipeline is modular and consists of many independently usable tools and software libraries. We draw attention to three particular tools which may be useful to other groups working on neoantigen vaccination. (1) Epidisco is a workflow which orchestrates the parallel execution of the PGV pipeline, including both common steps such as alignment as well as tools which have been developed specifically for the PGV-001 trial. (2) Vaxrank uses somatic variants and tumor RNA reads to select peptides for inclusion in a patients vaccine. (3) Isovar is a library used by Vaxrank to determine the mutated protein sequence associated with a genomic variant from supporting tumor RNA reads. We hope that the functionality of these tools may extend beyond the specifics of the PGV-001 trial and enable other research groups in their own neoantigen investigations.",

    "abstract": "There are numerous sources of variation in the rate of synonymous substitutions inside genes, such as direct selection on the nucleotide sequence, or mutation rate variation. Yet scans for positive selection rely on codon models which incorporate an assumption of effectively neutral synonymous substitution rate, constant between sites of each gene. Here we perform a large-scale comparison of approaches which incorporate codon substitution rate variation and propose our own simple yet effective modification of existing models. We find strong effects of substitution rate variation on positive selection inference. More than 70% of the genes detected by the classical branch-site model are presumably false positives caused by the incorrect assumption of uniform synonymous substitution rate. We propose a new model which is strongly favored by the data while remaining computationally tractable. With the new model we can capture signatures of nucleotide level selection acting on translation initiation and on splicing sites within the coding region. Finally, we show that rate variation is highest in the highly recombining regions, and we propose that recombination and mutation rate variation, such as high CpG mutation rate, are the two main sources of nucleotide rate variation. While we detect fewer genes under positive selection in Drosophila than without rate variation, the genes which we detect contain a stronger signal of adaptation of dynein, which could be associated with Wolbachia infection. We provide software to perform positive selection analysis using the new model.",

    "abstract": "Population genetic theory predicts that rapid adaptation is largely driven by complex traits encoded by many loci of small effect. Because large effect loci are quickly fixed in natural populations, they should not contribute much to rapid adaptation. To investigate the genetic architecture of thermal adaptation - a highly complex trait - we performed experimental evolution on a natural Drosophila simulans population. Transcriptome and respiration measurements revealed extensive metabolic rewiring after only [~]60 generations in a hot environment. Analysis of genome-wide polymorphisms identified two interacting selection targets, Sestrin and SNF4A{gamma}, pointing to AMPK, a central metabolic switch, as a key factor for thermal adaptation. Our results demonstrate that large-effect loci segregating at intermediate allele frequencies can allow natural populations to rapidly respond to selection. Because SNF4A{gamma} also exhibits clinal variation in various Drosophila species, we suggest that this large effect polymorphism is maintained by temporal and spatial temperature variation in natural environments.",

    "abstract": "The lack of a continuous in vitro culture system for Plasmodium vivax severely limits our knowledge of pathophysiology of the most widespread malaria parasite. To gain direct understanding of P. vivax human infections, we used Next Generation Sequencing data mining to unravel parasite in vivo expression profiles for P. vivax, and P. falciparum as comparison. We performed cloud and local computing to extract parasite transcriptomes from publicly available raw data of human blood samples. We developed a Poisson Modelling (PM) method to confidently identify parasite derived transcripts in mixed RNAseq signals of infected host tissues. We successfully retrieved and reconstructed parasite transcriptomes from infected patient blood as early as the first blood stage cycle; and the same methodology did not recover any significant signal from controls. Surprisingly, these first generation blood parasites already show strong signature of transmission, which indicates the commitment from asexual-to-sexual stages. Further, we develop mathematical models for P. vivax and P. falciparum to assess the epidemiological impact of possible 7-day early stage transmission and P. vivax complex life cycle. The study uncovers the earliest onset of P. vivax blood pathogenesis and highlights the challenges of P. vivax eradication programs.\\n\\nAuthor summaryWe discovered that P. vivax in vivo parasitemia is associated with gametocytogenesis expression signature within the first blood stage cycle, that is, eight days from a mosquito bite. Our results suggest that asexual-to-sexual commitment may happen with first generation merozoite infection. This allows for the possibility of transmission at this early stage, much earlier than for P. falciparum. Our novel mathematical model accounts for multiple unique aspects of P. vivax biology to advance our understanding of expected disease prevalence, and compares the results to those of P. falciparum. We demonstrate that given the presence of asymptotical carriers and the possibility of relapses, earlier parasite transmission is capable of increasing the spread of disease within human populations. In summary, P. vivax gametogenesis has the potential to fast track the transmission cycle, which will drive enhanced propagation of the disease during the transmission season and clinical relapses.",

In this work we develop an electroencephalography (EEG) based noninvasive BCI system that can be used for a similar, albeit lower-speed robotic control, and a signal processing system for detecting users mental intent from EEG data based on up to 6-state motor-imagery BCI communication paradigm. We examine the performance of that system on experimental data collected from 12 healthy participants and analyzed offline. We show that our EEG BCI system can correctly identify different motor imageries in EEG data with high accuracy: 3 out of 12 participants achieved accuracy of 6-state communication in 80-90% range, while 2 participants could not achieve a satisfactory accuracy. We further implement an online BCI system for control of a virtual 3 degree-of-freedom prosthetic manipulator and test it with our 3 best participants. The participants ability to control the BCI is quantified by using the percentage of successfully completed BCI tasks, the time required to complete a task, and the error rate. 2 participants were able to successfully complete 100% of the test tasks, demonstrating on average the error rate of 80% and requiring 5-10 seconds to execute a manipulator move. 1 participant failed to demonstrate a satisfactory performance in online trials. Our results lay a foundation for further development of EEG BCI-based robotic assistive systems and demonstrate that EEG-based BCI may be feasible for robotic control by paralyzed and immobilized individuals.",

We use Monte Carlo stochastic algorithm to find equilibrium configurations of these mechanosensors in two representative geometries: on a 1D ring representing the rim of a cell on flat surface, and a 2D bounded surface representing the whole area of cell contact with flat surface. The level of FAK activation depend on the pulling force applied to the individual FAKintegrin via actin-myosin contractile networks, and the details of the coupling between individual sensors in a cluster. Strong coupling is shown to make the FAK sensors experience a sharp on-off behaviour in their activation, while at low coupling the activation/autoinhibition transition occurs over a broad range of pulling force. We find that the activation/autoinhibition transition of FAK in the 2D system with strong coupling occurs with a hysteresis, the width of which depends on the rate of change of force. The effect of introducing a mediating protein (such as Src) in limited quantity to control FAK activation is explored, and visualizations of clustering in both topologies are presented. In particular the results on the bounded 2D surface indicate that clustering of active FAK occurs preferentially at the boundary, in agreement with experimental observations of focal adhesions in cells.",

Mouse embryonic epiblast cells and differentiating embryonic stem cells (ESCs) lacking SMCX show reduced expression of Xist RNA, which is required for X-inactivation. Smcx-heterozygous epiblast cells do not silence X-linked genes efficiently, despite robust Xist expression. Overexpression of mouse or human SMCX, but not a catalytically-inactive SMCX or the Y-chromosome homolog SMCY, is sufficient to induce Xist and, separately, to silence X-linked genes in male ESCs. Finally, SMCX dose is inversely correlated with H3K4me2 at X-linked loci. Thus, X-inactivation initiates through the evolutionarily conserved, dose-dependent function of the histone demethylase SMCX.",

    "abstract": "Individual Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dhc) strains differ primarily from one another by the number and identity of the reductive dehalogenase homologous catalytic subunit A (rdhA) genes contained within their respective genomes. While thousands of rdhA genes have been sequenced, the activity of the corresponding proteins have been identified in only a handful of cases. Most effort has focused on identifying the enzymes that dechlorinate substrates including trichloroethene (TCE), cis-dichloroethene (cDCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) relevant to groundwater remediation. The associated rdhA genes, namely tceA, bvcA, and vcrA, along with the D. mccartyi 16S rRNA gene are often used to track growth and dechlorinating activity in DNA extracted from field samples. In this study, we augmented the typical suite of three characterized rdhA genes to include an additional 12 uncharacterized rdhA sequences identified in the metagenome in the mixed Dhc-containing culture KB-1 to track population shifts within the culture and at two bioaugmented field sites. Quantitative PCR assays were developed for the 15 selected D. mccartyi rdhA genes and evaluated using 11 different sub-cultures of KB-1, each enriched on different chlorinated ethenes and ethanes. The proportion of rdhA gene copies relative to Dhc 16S gene copies indicated the presence of multiple distinct Dhc populations in each culture. The specific electron acceptor amended to each culture had a major influence on the distribution of D. mccartyi populations and their associated rdhA genes. We also surveyed the abundance of rdhA genes in samples obtained from two bioaugmented field sites. Growth of the dominant D. mccartyi population in the KB-1 inoculum was detected in the UK site samples. At both field sites, the measurement of relative rdhA abundances revaled significant D. mccartyi population shifts over time as dechlorination progressed from TCE through cDCE to VC and ethene, indicating that the selective pressure of the most abundant chlorinated electron acceptor that was observed in lab cultures was also occurring in the populations in the field. Understanding driving forces behind D. mccartyi population selection and activity is improving predictability of remediation performance at chlorinated solvent contaminated sites.",

    "abstract": "Thaumarchaea are ubiquitous in marine habitats where they participate in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Although metatranscriptomes suggest thaumarchaea are active microbes in marine waters, we understand little about how thaumarchaeal gene expression patterns relate to substrate utilization and activity. Here, we report the global transcriptional response of the marine ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeon  Candidatus Nitrosopelagicus brevis str. CN25 to ammonia limitation using RNA-Seq. We further describe the genome and transcriptome of Ca. N. brevis str. U25, a new strain capable of urea utilization. Ammonia limitation in CN25 resulted in reduced expression of transcripts coding for ammonia oxidation proteins, and increased expression of a gene coding an Hsp20-like chaperone. Despite significantly different transcript abundances across treatments, two ammonia monooxygenase subunits (amoAB), a nitrite reductase (nirK), and both ammonium transporter genes were always among the most abundant transcripts, regardless of growth state. Ca. N. brevis str. U25 cells expressed a urea transporter 139-fold more than the urease catalytic subunit ureC. Gene co-expression networks derived from culture transcriptomes and ten thaumarchaea-enriched metatranscriptomes revealed a high degree of correlated gene expression across disparate environmental conditions and identified a module of genes, including amoABC and nirK, that we hypothesize to represent the core ammonia oxidation machinery.\\n\\nOriginality-Significance StatementDiscovering gene function in fastidious or uncultivated lineages remains one of the biggest challenges in environmental microbiology. Here, we use an approach that combines controlled laboratory experiments with in situ transcript abundance data from the environment to identify genes that share similar transcription patterns in marine ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaea. These findings demonstrate how transcriptomes from microbial cultures can be used together with complex environmental samples to identify suites of co-expressed genes that are otherwise enigmatic and provide new insights into the mechanism of ammonia oxidation. Our results add to the growing body of literature showing that relatively small changes in transcript abundance are linked to large changes in growth in organisms with reduced genomes, suggesting they have limited capacity for metabolic regulation or that they rely on mechanisms other than transcriptional regulation to deal with a fluctuating environment.",

In this study, we evaluated preparation methods for mouse gut with the goal of preserving micron-scale spatial structure while performing fluorescence imaging assays. Our evaluation of embedding methods showed that commonly used media such as Tissue-Tek Optimal Cutting Temperature (OCT) compound, paraffin, and polyester waxes resulted in redistribution of luminal contents. By contrast, a hydrophilic methacrylate resin, Technovit H8100, preserved three-dimensional organization. Our mouse intestinal preparation protocol optimized using the Technovit H8100 embedding method was compatible with microbial fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and other labeling techniques, including immunostaining and staining with both wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Mucus labeling patterns of the samples fixed with paraformaldehyde (PFA) and Carnoys fixative were comparable. The protocol optimized in this study enabled simultaneous visualization of micron-scale spatial patterns formed by microbial cells in the mouse intestines along with biogeographical landmarks such as host-derived mucus and food particles.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExplaining the variability in drug sensitivity across a panel of cell lines using genomic information is a key aspect of cancer drug discovery. The results of such analyses may ultimately determine which patients are likely to benefit from a new treatment. There are numerous experimental factors that can influence the outcomes of cell line screening panels such as the number of replicates, number of doses explored etc. Simulation studies can aid in understanding how variability in these experimental factors can affect the statistical power of a given analysis method. In this study dose response data was simulated for a variety of experimental designs and the ability of different methods to retrieve the original simulation parameters was compared. The analysis methods under consideration were a combination of non-linear least squares and ANOVA, conventional approach, versus non-linear mixed effects.\\n\\nResultsAcross the simulation studies explored the mixed-effects approach gave similar and in some situations greater statistical power than the conventional approach. In particular the mixed-effects approach gave significantly greater power when there was less information per dose response curve, and when more cell lines screened. More generally the best way to improve statistical power was to screen more cell lines.\\n\\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates the value of simulating data to understand design and analysis choices in the context of cancer drug sensitivity screening. By illustrating the performance of different methods in different situations these results will help researchers in the field generate and analyse data on future preclinical compounds. Ultimately this will benefit patients by ensuring that biomarkers of drug sensitivity have an increased chance of being identified at the preclinical stage.",

Here, a rigorous stability analysis of a multiscale model within-host and between-host is presented. The within-host model describes virus replication and the respective immune response while disease transmission is represented by a simple susceptible-infected (SI) model.\\n\\nThe bridge of within-to between-host is by considering transmission as a function of the viral load of the within-host level. Consequently, stability and bifurcation analyses were developed coupling the two basic reproduction numbers [Formula] and [Formula]for the within- and the between-host subsystems, respectively. Local stability results for each subsystem, such as a unique stable equilibrium point, recapitulate classical approaches to infection and epidemic control.\\n\\nUsing a Lyapunov function, global stability of the between-host system was obtained. A main result was the derivation of the [Formula] as a general increasing function of [Formula]. Numerical analyses reveal that a Michaelis-Menten form based on the virus is more likely to recapitulate the behavior between the scales than a form directly proportional to the virus. Our work contributes basic understandings of the two models and casts light on the potential effects of the coupling function on linking the two scales.",

We then predicted small intestinal inflammation using genetic risk score, smoking status, number of relatives with CD, capsule transit time, and the panel of biomarkers in 124 individuals with complete data. Our principal analysis was to calculate the predictive utility from two machine learning classifiers: an elastic net and a random forest.\\n\\nResultsBoth classifiers successfully predicted FDRs with intestinal inflammation: elastic net (AUC=0.80, 95% CI: 0.62-0.98), random forest (AUC=0.87, 95% CI: 0.75-1.00). The elastic net selected a 3-predictor solution: CD family history (OR=1.31), genetic risk score (OR=1.14), and faecal calprotectin (OR=1.04). The same 3 variables were among the top 5 most important predictors as ranked by the random forest.\\n\\nConclusionA readily collectable panel of genetic risk variants, added to family history and faecal calprotectin, predicts those at greatest risk for developing CD with a good degree of accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Influenza causes substantial morbidity and mortality and places strain on healthcare systems, some of which could be mitigated by accurate forecasting. Specific humidity and school vacations have both been shown independently to affect the transmission dynamics of influenza at large spatial scales. Here, we compare the ability of five compartmental transmission models, which include these two processes, to explain influenza-like-illness (ILI) incidence data for five United States counties for which school vacations and specific humidity data were available over a span of four seasons. We used the models in two different ways. First we fitted all available data at the same time and assessed model performance using standard measures of parsimony and goodness-of-fit. Then we conducted a retrospective forecasting study in which we attempted to predict incidence beyond a given week by fitting to data available up to that week. In general, when fitting the data using the whole season, we found that either specific humidity, school closures, or a combined model incorporating both effects captured the variability in incidence better than a fully constrained SIR-like model. Moreover, where these factors play a role, the timing of the variations suggests a causal relationship. When school vacations and specific humidity were important, the model-estimated parameters were broadly consistent. Retrospective forecasting simulations were consistent with the explanatory use of the models, with both specific humidity and school vacations giving more accurate forecasts than a simple SIR-like model in some populations and for some seasons. Our results suggest that influenza forecast models should test for the importance of different factors such as school vacations and specific humidity on a population-by-population and year-by-year basis.\\n\\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding the underlying factors that contribute to the transmission of influenza is crucial for developing models with predictive capabilities. In this study, we address two key effects: humidity and school vacations. We show that both can play an important role, depending on the location of the population as well as the timing of the school vacations. We then demonstrate how such mechanistic models can be used to forecast an influenza season as it unfolds, including estimates of the uncertainty of the predictions at each week of the forecast. To make better influenza forecasts, models need to test whether factors such as school vacations and specific humidity are important for a given season and population.",

Such subpopulations can be identified by considering the proportion that cases in a subpopulation represent among all cases in the population occurring before (Bp) and after the epidemic peak (Ap) to calculate the subpopulation's relative risk, RR=Bp/Ap. We estimated RR for several age groups using data on RSV hospitalizations in the US between 2001-2012 from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP).\\n\\nResultsChildren aged 3-4y and 5-6y each had the highest RR estimate for 5/11 seasons in the data, with RSV hospitalization rates in infants being generally higher during seasons when children aged 5-6y had the highest RR estimates. Children aged 2y had the highest RR estimate during one season. RR estimates in infants and individuals aged 11y and older were mostly lower than in children aged 1-10y.\\n\\nConclusionsThe RR estimates suggest that preschool and young school-age children have the leading relative roles during RSV epidemics.

    "abstract": "Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) are important food-borne pathogens and a major cause of haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) worldwide. In 1995 a severe HUS outbreak in Adelaide occurred. A recent genomic analysis of STEC O111:H-strains 95JB1 and 95NR1 from this outbreak found that the more virulent isolate, 95NR1, harboured two additional copies of the Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) genes although the structure of the Stx2-converting prophages could not be fully resolved due to the fragmented assembly. In this study we have used Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) single molecule real-time (SMRT) long read sequencing to characterise the complete epigenome (genome and methylome) of 95JB1 and 95NR1. Using long reads we completely resolved the structure of two, tandemly inserted, stx2-converting phage in 95NR1. Our analysis of the methylome of 95NR1 and 95JB1 identified hemi-methylation of a novel motif (5-CTGCm6AG-3) in more than 4000 sites in the 95NR1 genome. These sites were entirely unmethalyted in the 95JB1, including at least 180 potential promoter regions that could explain regulatory differences between the strains. We identified a Type IIG methyltransferase encoded in both genomes in association with three additional genes in an operon-like arrangement. IS1203 mediated disruption of this operon in 95JB1 is the likely cause of the observed differential patterns of methylation between 95NR1 and 95JB1. This study demonstrates the enormous potential of PacBio SMRT sequencing to resolve complex prophage regions and reveal the genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity within a clonal population of bacteria.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDuring adaptive immune responses, activated B cells expand and undergo somatic hypermutation of their immunoglobulin (Ig) receptor, forming a clone of diversified cells that can be related back to a common ancestor. Identification of B cell clonotypes from high-throughput Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-seq) data relies on computational analysis. Recently, we proposed an automate method to partition sequences into clonal groups based on single-linkage clustering of the Ig receptor junction region with length-normalized hamming distance metric. This method could identify clonally-related sequences with high confidence on several benchmark experimental and simulated data sets. However, this approach was computationally expensive, and unable to provide estimates of accuracy for new data. Here, a new method is presented that address this computational bottleneck and also provides a study-specific estimation of performance, including sensitivity and specificity. The method uses a finite mixture modeling fitting procedure for learning the parameters of two univariate curves which fit the bimodal distributions of the distance vector between pairs of sequences. These distribution are used to estimate the performance of different threshold choices for partitioning sequences into clonotypes. These performance estimates are validated using simulated and experimental datasets. With this method, clonotypes can be identified from AIRR-seq data with sensitivity and specificity profiles that are user-defined based on the overall goals of the study.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource code is freely available at the Immcantation Portal: www.immcantation.com under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.\\n\\nContactsteven.kleinstein@yale.edu",

    "abstract": "Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) are small globular proteins with hydrophobic binding pockets that have a role in detection of chemicals, regulation of development and growth and host seeking behaviour and feeding of arthropods. Here, we show that a CSP has evolved to modulate plant immune responses. Firstly, we found that the green peach aphid Myzus persicae CSP Mp10, which is delivered into the cytoplasm of plant cells, suppresses the reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts to both aphid and bacterial elicitors in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana benthamiana. Aphid RNA interference studies demonstrated that Mp10 modulates the first layer of the plant defence response, specifically the BAK1 pathway. We identified Mp10 homologs in diverse plant-sucking insect species, including aphids, whiteflies, psyllids and leafhoppers, but not in other insect species, including blood-feeding hemipteran insects. We found that Mp10 homologs from other splant-sucking insect species are also capable of suppressing plant ROS. Together, these data and phylogenetic analyses provides evidence that an ancestral Mp10-like sequence acquired plant ROS suppression activity before the divergence of plant-sucking insect species over 250 million years ago.\\n\\nSignificanceAphids, whiteflies, psyllids, leafhoppers and planthoppers are plant-sucking insects of the order Hemiptera that cause dramatic crop losses via direct feeding damage and vectoring of plant pathogens. Chemosensory proteins (CSPs) regulate behavioural and developmental processes in arthropods. Here we show that the CSP Mp10 of the green peach aphid Myzus persicae is an effector that suppresses plant reactive oxygen species (ROS) bursts and the first layer of plant defence responses. Surprisingly, Mp10 homologs are present in diverse plant-feeding hemipteran species, but not blood-feeding ones.

    "abstract": "Expansion microscopy is a recently introduced imaging technique that achieves super-resolution through physically expanding the specimen by ~4x, after embedding into a swellable gel. The resolution attained is, correspondingly, approximately 4-fold better than the diffraction limit, or ~70 nm. This is a major improvement over conventional microscopy, but still lags behind modern STED or STORM setups, whose resolution can reach 20-30 nm. We addressed this issue here by introducing an improved gel recipe that enables an expansion factor of ~10x in each dimension, which corresponds to an expansion of the sample volume by more than 1000-fold. Our protocol, which we termed X10 microscopy, achieves a resolution of 25-30 nm on conventional epifluorescence microscopes. X10 provides multi-color images similar or even superior to those produced with more challenging methods, such as STED, STORM and iterative expansion microscopy (iExM), in both cell cultures and tissues.",

    "abstract": "CTCF is an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed architectural protein regulating a plethora of cellular functions via different molecular mechanisms. CTCF can undergo a number of post-translational modifications which change its properties and functions. One such modifications linked to cancer is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation). The highly PARylated CTCF form has an apparent molecular mass of 180 kDa (referred to as CTCF180), which can be distinguished from hypo- and non-PARylated CTCF with the apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa (referred to as CTCF130). The existing data accumulated so far have been mainly related to CTCF130. However, the properties of CTCF180 are not well understood despite its abundance in a number of primary tissues. In this study we performed ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses in human breast cells 226LDM, which display predominantly CTCF130 when proliferating, but CTCF180 upon cell cycle arrest. We observed that in the arrested cells the majority of sites lost CTCF, whereas fewer sites gained CTCF or remain bound (i.e. common sites). The classical CTCF binding motif was found in the lost and common, but not in the gained sites. The changes in CTCF occupancies in the lost and common sites were associated with increased chromatin densities and altered expression from the neighboring genes. Based on these results we propose a model integrating the CTCF130/180 transition with CTCF-DNA binding and gene expression changes. This study also issues an important cautionary note concerning the design and interpretation of any experiments using cells and tissues where CTCF180 may be present.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is an urgent need to increase global crop production. Identifying and combining genes controlling indidviual yield components, such as grain weight, holds the potential to enhance crop yields. Transcriptomics is a powerful tool to gain insights into the complex gene regulatory networks that underlie such traits, but relies on the availability of a high-quality reference sequence and accurate gene models. Previously, we identified a grain weight QTL on wheat chromosome 5A (5A QTL) which acts during early grain development to increase grain length through cell expansion in the pericarp. In this study, we performed RNA-sequencing on near isogenic lines (NILs) segregating for the 5A QTL and used the latest gene models to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes and pathways that potentially influence pericarp cell size and grain weight in wheat.\\n\\nResultsWe sampled grains at four and eight days post anthesis and found genes associated with metabolism, biosynthesis, proteoloysis and defence response to be upregulated during this stage of grain development in both NILs. We identified a specific set of 112 transcripts DE between 5A NILs at either time point, including seven potential candidates for the causal gene underlying the 5A QTL. The 112 DE transcripts had functional annotations including non-coding RNA, transpon-associated, cell-cycle control, and ubiquitin-related processes. Many of the wheat genes identified belong to families that have been previously associated with seed/grain development in other species. However, few of these wheat genes are the direct orthologs and none have been previously characterised in wheat. Notably, we identified DE transcripts at almost all steps of the pathway associated with ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation. In the promoters of a subset of DE transcripts we identified enrichment of binding sites associated with C2H2, MYB/SANT, YABBY, AT HOOK and Trihelix transcription factor families.\\n\\nConclusionsIn this study, we identified DE transcripts with a diverse range of predicted biological functions, reflecting the complex nature of the pathways that control early grain development. Further functional characterisation of these candidates and how they interact could provide new insights into the control of grain size in cereals, ultimately improving crop yield.",

We develop a likelihood-based approach for analyzing summary-level statistics and external LD information to estimate common variants effect-size distributions, characterized by proportion of underlying susceptibility SNPs and a flexible normal-mixture model for their effects. Analysis of summary-level results across 32 GWAS reveals that while all traits are highly polygenic, there is wide diversity in the degrees of polygenicity. The effect-size distributions for susceptibility SNPs could be adequately modeled by a single normal distribution for traits related to mental health and ability and by a mixture of two normal distributions for all other traits. Among quantitative traits, we predict the sample sizes needed to identify SNPs which explain 80% of GWAS heritability to be between 300K-500K for some of the early growth traits, between 1-2 million for some anthropometric and cholesterol traits and multiple millions for body mass index and some others. The corresponding predictions for disease traits are between 200K-400K for inflammatory bowel diseases, close to one million for a variety of adult onset chronic diseases and between 1-2 million for psychiatric diseases.",

Several such methods have been developed, including a mode-based estimation method giving consistent estimates if a plurality of genetic variants are valid instruments; that is, there is no larger subset of invalid instruments estimating the same causal parameter than the subset of valid instruments.\\n\\nMethodsWe here develop a model averaging method that gives consistent estimates under the same  plurality of valid instruments assumption. The method considers a mixture distribution of estimates derived from each subset of genetic variants. The estimates are weighted such that subsets with more genetic variants receive more weight, unless variants in the subset have heterogeneous causal estimates, in which case that subset is severely downweighted. The mode of this mixture distribution is the causal estimate. This heterogeneity-penalized model averaging method has several technical advantages over the previously proposed mode-based estimation method.\\n\\nResultsThe heterogeneity-penalized model averaging method outperformed the mode-based estimation in terms of effciency and outperformed other robust methods in terms of Type 1 error rate in an extensive simulation analysis. The proposed method suggests two distinct mechanisms by which inflammation affects coronary heart disease risk, with subsets of variants suggesting both positive and negative causal effects.\\n\\nConclusionsThe heterogeneity-penalized model averaging method is an additional robust method for Mendelian randomization with excellent theoretical and practical properties, and can reveal features in the data such as the presence of multiple causal mechanisms.

In a rapidly changing climate, understanding the genetic basis of flowering time variation is important for both agriculture and ecology. Genetic mapping has revealed many genetic variants affecting flowering time, but the effects on the gene regulatory networks in population-scale are still largely unknown. We dissected flowering time networks using multi-layered Swedish population data from Arabidopsis thaliana, consisting of flowering time and transcriptome collected under constant 10{degrees}C growth temperature in addition to full genome sequence data. Our analysis identified multiple alleles of the key flowering time gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) as the primary determinant of the network underlying flowering time variation under our condition. Genetic variation of FLC affects multiple-pathways through known flowering-time genes including FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1). We demonstrated that an extremely simple single-locus model of FLC involving allelic variation and expression explains almost a half of flowering time variation, with 60% of the effect being mediated through FLC expression. Furthermore, the accuracy of the model fitted at 10{degrees}C is almost unchanged at 16{degrees}C.",

In the present study we deploy sibling models to offer a novel and unbiased way to ascertain loci associated with the extent to which phenotypes vary (variance-controlling quantitative trait loci, or vQTLs). Previous methods for vQTL-mapping either exclude genetically related individuals or treat genetic relatedness among individuals as a complicating factor addressed by adjusting estimates for non-independence in phenotypes. The present method uses genetic relatedness as a tool to obtain unbiased estimates of variance effects rather than as a nuisance. The family-based approach, which utilizes random variation between siblings in minor allele counts at a locus, also allows controls for parental genotype, mean effects, and non-linear (dominance) effects that may spuriously appear to generate variation.\\n\\nSimulations show that the approach performs equally well as two existing methods (squared Z-score and DGLM) in controlling type I error rates when there is no unobserved confounding, and performs significantly better than these methods in the presence of confounding. Using height and BMI as empirical applications, we investigate SNPs that alter within-family variation in height and BMI, as well as pathways that appear to be enriched. One significant SNP for BMI variability, in the MAST4 gene, replicated. Pathway analysis revealed one gene set, encoding members of several signaling pathways related to gap junction function, which appears significantly enriched for associations with within-family height variation in both datasets (while not enriched in analysis of mean levels).

    "abstract": "Norovirus infections are a major cause of acute viral gastroenteritis and a significant burden to human health globally. A vital process for norovirus replication is the processing of the nonstructural polyprotein, by an internal protease, into the necessary viral components required to form the viral replication complex. This cleavage occurs at different rates resulting in the accumulation of stable precursor forms. In this report, we characterized how precursor forms of the norovirus protease accumulate during infection. Using stable forms of the protease precursors we demonstrated that these are all proteolytically active in vitro, but that when expressed in cells, activity is determined by both substrate and protease localization. Whilst all precursors could cleave a replication complex-associated substrate, only a subset of precursors lacking NS4 were capable of efficiently cleaving a cytoplasmic substrate. For the first time, the full range of protein-protein interactions between murine and human norovirus proteins were mapped by LUMIER assay, with conserved interactions between replication complex members, modifying the localization of a subset of precursors. Finally, we demonstrate that re-targeting of a poorly cleaved artificial cytoplasmic substrate to the replication complex is sufficient to permit efficient cleavage in the context of norovirus infection. This offers a model for how norovirus can regulate the timing of substrate cleavage throughout the replication cycle. The norovirus protease represents a key target in the search for effective antiviral treatments for norovirus infection. An improved understanding of protease function and regulation, as well as identification of interactions between the other non-structural proteins, offers new avenues for antiviral drug design.",

Analysis of hundreds of Salmonella genomes has revealed that ST313 is closely-related to the ST19 group of S. Typhimurium that cause gastroenteritis across the world. The core genomes of ST313 and ST19 vary by just 1000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We hypothesised that the phenotypic differences that distinguish African Salmonella from ST19 are caused by certain SNPs that directly modulate the transcription of virulence genes.\\n\\nHere we identified 3,597 transcriptional start sites (TSS) of the ST313 strain D23580, and searched for a gene expression signature linked to pathogenesis of Salmonella. We identified a SNP in the promoter of the pgtE gene that caused high expression of the PgtE virulence factor in African S. Typhimurium, increased the degradation of the factor B component of human complement, contributed to serum resistance and modulated virulence in the chicken infection model. The PgtE protease is known to mediate systemic infection in animal models. We propose that high levels of expression PgtE of by African S. Typhimurium ST313 promotes bacterial survival and bacterial dissemination during human infection.\\n\\nOur finding of a functional role for an extra-genic SNP shows that approaches used to deduce the evolution of virulence in bacterial pathogens should include a focus on non-coding regions of the genome.",

    "abstract": "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has profiled over 10,000 tumors across 33 different cancer-types for many genomic features, including gene expression levels. Gene expression measurements capture substantial information about the state of each tumor. Certain classes of deep neural network models are capable of learning a meaningful latent space. Such a latent space could be used to explore and generate hypothetical gene expression profiles under various types of molecular and genetic perturbation. For example, one might wish to use such a model to predict a tumors response to specific therapies or to characterize complex gene expression activations existing in differential proportions in different tumors. Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a deep neural network approach capable of generating meaningful latent spaces for image and text data. In this work, we sought to determine the extent to which a VAE can be trained to model cancer gene expression, and whether or not such a VAE would capture biologically-relevant features. In the following report, we introduce a VAE trained on TCGA pan-cancer RNA-seq data, identify specific patterns in the VAE encoded features, and discuss potential merits of the approach.

From a systems biology perspective, Tybalt could one day aid in cancer stratification or predict specific activated expression patterns that would result from genetic changes or treatment effects.",

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges faced in defining clinically applicable and homogeneous molecular tumor subtypes is assigning biological and/or clinical interpretations to etiological (intrinsic) subtypes. The conventional approach involves at least three steps: Firstly, identify subtypes using unsupervised clustering of patient tumours with molecular (etiological) profiles; secondly associate the subtypes with clinical or phenotypic information (covariates) to infer some biological meaning to the redefined subtypes; and thirdly, identify clinically relevant biomarkers associated with the subtypes. Here, we report the implementation of a tool, phenotype mapping (phenMap), which combines these three steps to define functional subtypes with associated phenotypic information and molecular signatures. phenMap models meta (unobserved) variables as a function of covariates to expose any underlying clustering structure within the data and discover associations between subtypes and phenotypes. We demonstrate how this tool can more avidly identify functional subtypes that are an improvement over already existing etiological subtypes by analysing published breast cancer gene expression data.",

    "abstract": "The advent of genomic data from densely sampled bacterial populations has created a need for flexible simulators by which models and hypotheses can be efficiently investigated in the light of empirical observations. Bacmeta provides fast stochastic simulation of neutral evolution within a large collection of interconnected bacterial populations with completely adjustable connectivity network. Stochastic events of mutations, recombinations, insertions/deletions, migrations and microepidemics can be simulated in discrete non-overlapping generations with a Wright-Fisher model that operates on explicit sequence data of any desired genome length. Each model component, including locus, bacterial strain, population, and ultimately the whole metapopulation, is efficiently simulated using C++ objects, and detailed metadata from each level of the simulation can be acquired. The software can be executed in a cluster environment using simple textual input files, enabling, e.g., large-scale simulations and likelihood-free inference. Bacmeta is implemented with C++ for Linux, Mac and Windows.

    "abstract": "The coronavirus (CoV) RNA genome is the largest among single-stranded positive sense RNA viruses. CoVs encode a proofreading 3'[-&gt;]5'exoribonuclease within nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14-ExoN) that is responsible for CoV high-fidelity replication. Alanine substitution of ExoN catalytic residues [ExoN(-)] in SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus (MHV) disrupts ExoN activity, yielding viable mutant viruses with defective replication, up to 20-fold decreased fidelity, and increased susceptibility to nucleoside analogs. To test the stability of the ExoN(-) genotype and phenotype, we passaged MHV-ExoN(-) 250 times in cultured cells (P250), in parallel with WT-MHV. Compared to MHV-ExoN(-) P3, MHV-ExoN(-) P250 demonstrated enhanced replication, reduced susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and increased competitive fitness. However, passage did not select for complete or partial reversion at the ExoN-inactivating mutations. We identified novel amino acid changes within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp) and nsp14 of MHV-ExoN(-) P250 that partially account for the observed changes in replication, susceptibility to nucleoside analogs, and competitive fitness observed in the passaged virus population, indicating that additional determinants can compensate for the activities of nsp14-ExoN. Our results suggest that while selection favors restoration of replication fidelity in ExoN(-) CoVs, there may be a significant barrier to ExoN(-) reversion. These results also support the hypothesis that high-fidelity replication is linked to CoV fitness and identify additional candidate proteins that may regulate CoV replication fidelity.\\n\\nIMPORTANCEUnique among RNA viruses, CoVs encode a proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in nsp14 that mediates high-fidelity RNA genome replication. Proofreading-deficient CoVs with disrupted ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are either non-viable or have significant defects in replication, RNA synthesis, fidelity, fitness, and virulence. In this study, we show that ExoN(-) murine hepatitis virus can adapt over long-term passage for increased replication and fitness without reverting the ExoN-inactivating mutations. Passage-adapted ExoN(-) mutants also demonstrate increasing resistance to nucleoside analogs that is only partially explained by secondary mutations in nsp12 and nsp14. These data suggest that enhanced resistance to nucleoside analogs is mediated by the interplay of multiple replicase proteins and support the proposed link between CoV fidelity and fitness.",
