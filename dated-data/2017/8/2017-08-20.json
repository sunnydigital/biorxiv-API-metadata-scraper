    "abstract": "Despite the success of large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWASs) on complex traits, our understanding of their genetic architecture is far from complete. Jointly modeling multiple traits genetic profiles has provided insights into the shared genetic basis of many complex traits. However, large-scale inference sets a high bar for both statistical power and biological interpretability. Here we introduce a principled framework to estimate annotation-stratified genetic covariance between traits using GWAS summary statistics. Through theoretical and numerical analyses we demonstrate that our method provides accurate covariance estimates, thus enabling researchers to dissect both the shared and distinct genetic architecture across traits to better understand their etiologies. Among 50 complex traits with publicly accessible GWAS summary statistics (Ntotal {approx} 4.5 million), we identified more than 170 pairs with statistically significant genetic covariance. In particular, we found strong genetic covariance between late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), two major neurodegenerative diseases, in single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with high minor allele frequencies and in SNPs located in the predicted functional genome. Joint analysis of LOAD, ALS, and other traits highlights LOADs correlation with cognitive traits and hints at an autoimmune component for ALS.",

    "abstract": "The dynamics of stage-structured populations facing variability in resource availability and/or demographic factors like unequal sex-ratios, remains poorly understood. We addressed these issues using a stage-structured individual-based model that incorporates life-history parameters common to many holometabolous insects. The model was calibrated using time series data from a 49-generation experiment on laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster, subjected to four different combinations of larval and adult nutritional levels. The model was able to capture multiple qualitative and quantitative aspects of the empirical time series across three independent studies. We then simulated the model to explore the interaction of various life-history parameters and nutritional levels in determining population stability. In all nutritional regimes, stability of the populations was reduced upon increasing egg-hatchability, critical mass and proportion of body resource allocated to female fecundity. However, the stability-effects of increasing sensitivity of female-fecundity to adult density varied across nutrition regimes. The effects of unequal sex-ratio and sex-specific culling were greatly influenced by fecundity but not by levels of juvenile nutrition. Finally, we investigated the implications of some of these insights on the efficiency of the widely-used pest control method, Sterile Insect Technique (SIT). We show that increasing the amount of juvenile food had no effects on SIT efficiency when the density-independent fecundity is low, but reduces SIT efficiency when the density-independent fecundity is high.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila, ubiquitous expression of a short Cyclin G isoform generates extreme developmental noise estimated by fluctuating asymmetry (FA), providing a model to tackle developmental stability. This transcriptional cyclin interacts with chromatin regulators of the Enhancer of Trithorax and Polycomb (ETP) and Polycomb families. We investigate here the importance of these interactions in developmental stability. Deregulation of Cyclin G highlights an organ intrinsic control of developmental noise, linked to the ETP-interacting domain, and enhanced by mutations in genes encoding members of the Polycomb Repressive complexes PRC1 and PR-DUB. Deep-sequencing of wing imaginal discs deregulating CycG reveals that high developmental noise correlates with up-regulation of genes involved in translation and down-regulation of genes involved in energy production. Most Cyclin G direct transcriptional targets are also direct targets of PRC1, ASX and RNAPolII in the developing wing. Altogether, our results suggest that Cyclin G, PRC1 and PR-DUB cooperate for developmental stability.",

    "abstract": "Dynamin is a mechanochemical GTPase essential for membrane fission during clathrin mediated endocytosis. Dynamin forms washer ring-shaped/helical complexes at the neck of clathrin-coated pits and their structural changes coupled with GTP hydrolysis drive membrane fission. Dynamin and its binding protein amphiphysin cooperatively regulates membrane remodeling during fission, but its precise mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we analyze structural changes of dynamin-amphiphysin complexes during membrane fission using electron microscopy (EM) and high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM). Interestingly, HS-AFM analyses show that the dynamin-amphiphysin rings are rearranged to form clusters upon GTP hydrolysis and membrane constriction occurs at protein-uncoated regions flanking the clusters. We also show a novel function of amphiphysin in size control of the clusters to enhance biogenesis of endocytic vesicles. Our new approaches using combination of EM and HS-AFM clearly demonstrates dynamics of dynamin-amphiphysin complexes during membrane fission suggesting a novel \\\"clusterase\\\" model of dynamin-mediated membrane fission.",

    "abstract": "The central extended amygdala (EAc)--including the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce)--plays a key role in orchestrating states of fear and anxiety and is implicated in the development and maintenance of anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse. Although it is widely thought that these disorders reflect the coordinated actions of large-scale functional circuits in the brain, the architecture of the EAc functional network, and the degree to which the BST and the Ce show distinct patterns of intrinsic functional connectivity, remains incompletely understood. Here, we leveraged a combination of approaches to trace the connectivity of the BST and the Ce in 130 psychiatrically healthy, racially diverse, community-dwelling adults with enhanced power and precision. Multiband imaging, high-precision data registration techniques, and spatially unsmoothed data were used to maximize anatomical specificity. Using newly developed seed regions, whole-brain regression analyses revealed robust functional connectivity between the BST and Ce via the sublenticular extended amygdala ( substantia innominata), the ribbon of subcortical gray matter encompassing the ventral amygdalofugal pathway. Both regions displayed significant coupling with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), midcingulate cortex (MCC), insula, and anterior hippocampus. The BST showed significantly stronger connectivity with prefrontal territories--including the vmPFC, anterior MCC and pregenual anterior cingulate cortex--as well as the thalamus, striatum, and the periaqueductal gray. The only regions showing stronger functional connectivity with the Ce were located in the anterior hippocampus and dorsal amygdala. These observations provide a baseline against which to compare a range of special populations, inform our understanding of the role of the EAc in normal and pathological fear and anxiety, and highlight the value of several new approaches to image registration which may be particularly useful for researchers working with  de-identified neuroimaging data.\\n\\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=102 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/178533_ufig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (61K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10ce93corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a467ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19b4550org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e38e2a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Intrinsic functional connectivity of bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce) in 130 psychiatrically healthy adults.\\n\\nC_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIBST and Ce implicated in normal and pathological fear and anxiety\\nC_LIO_LITraced the intrinsic functional connectivity of the BST and the Ce in 130 adults\\nC_LIO_LIMultiband imaging, high-precision registration, unsmoothed data, newly developed seeds\\nC_LIO_LIBST and Ce show robust coupling with one another, hippocampus, insula, MCC, and vmPFC\\nC_LIO_LIBST shows stronger coupling with prefrontal/cingulate territories and brainstem/PAG\\nC_LI",

We compared the swimming kinematics among a diverse array of medusae, varying in taxonomy, morphology and propulsive and foraging modes, in order to evaluate the prevalence of PER in medusae. We found that while PER is commonly observed among taxa, the magnitude of the contribution to overall swimming varied greatly. The ability of medusae to utilize PER was not related to morphology and swimming performance but was controlled by their swimming kinematics. Utilizing PER required the medusae to pause after bell expansion and individuals could modulate their PER by changing their pause duration. Passive energy recapture can greatly enhance swimming efficiency but there appear to be trade-offs associated with utilizing PER.",

DrugPattern first collected and curated 7019 drug sets, including indications, adverse reaction, targets, pathways etc. For a list of interested drugs, DrugPattern then evaluates the significance of the enrichment of these drugs in each of the 7019 drug sets. To validate DrugPattern, we applied it to predict the potential protective roles of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a widely accepted deleterious factor for the body. We predicted that oxLDL has beneficial effects on some diseases, most of which were supported by literature except type 2 diabetes (T2D), in which oxLDL was previously believed to be a risk factor. Animal experiments further validated that oxLDL indeed has beneficial effects on T2D. These data confirmed the prediction accuracy of our approach and revealed unexpected protective roles for oxLDL in various diseases including T2D. This study provides a tool to infer regular patterns in biomedical datasets based on drug set enrichment analysis.",

    "abstract": "Interpretation of genetic variation is required for understanding genotype-phenotype associations, mechanisms of inherited disease, and drivers of cancer. Millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in human genomes are known and thousands are associated with disease. An estimated 20% of disease-associated missense SNVs are located in protein sites of post-translational modifications (PTMs), chemical modifications of amino acids that extend protein function. ActiveDriverDB is a comprehensive human proteo-genomics database that annotates disease mutations and population variants using PTMs. We integrated >385,000 published PTM sites with [~]3.8 million missense SNVs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the ClinVar database of disease genes, and inter-individual variation from human genome sequencing projects. The database includes interaction networks of proteins, upstream enzymes such as kinases, and drugs targeting these enzymes. We also predicted network-rewiring impact of mutations by analyzing gains and losses of kinase-bound sequence motifs. ActiveDriverDB provides detailed visualization, filtering, browsing and searching options for studying PTM-associated SNVs. Users can upload mutation datasets interactively and use our application programming interface for pipelines. Integrative analysis of SNVs and PTMs helps decipher molecular mechanisms of phenotypes and disease, as exemplified by case studies of disease genes TP53, BRCA2 and VHL.

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases can influence the life history strategy of their hosts and such influences subsequently impact the demography of infected populations, reducing viability independently of increased mortality or morbidity. Amphibians are the most threatened group of vertebrates and emerging infectious diseases play a large role in their population declines. Viruses of genus Ranavirus are responsible for one of the deadliest of these diseases. To date no work has evaluated the impact of ranaviruses on host life-history post metamorphosis or population demographic structure at the individual level. In this study, we used skeletochronology and morphology to evaluate the impact of ranaviruses on the demography of populations of European common frog (Rana temporaria) in the United Kingdom. We compared ecologically similar populations that differed only in their historical presence or absence of ranaviral disease. Our results suggest that ranaviruses are associated with shifts in the age structure of infected populations, potentially caused by increased adult mortality and associated shifts in the life history of younger age classes. Population projection models indicate that such age truncation could heighten the vulnerability of frog populations to stochastic environmental challenges. Our individual level data provide further compelling evidence that the emergence of infectious diseases can alter host demography, subsequently increasing population vulnerability to additional stressors.",

    "abstract": "After domestication in the Near East around 10,000 years ago several founder crops, flax included, spread to European latitudes. On reaching northerly latitudes the architecture of domesticated flax became more suitable to fiber production over oil, with longer stems, smaller seeds and fewer axillary branches. Latitudinal adaptations in crops typically result in changes in flowering time, often involving the PEBP family of genes that also have the potential to influence plant architecture. Two PEBP family genes in the flax genome, LuTFL1 and LuTFL2, vary in wild and cultivated flax over latitudinal range with cultivated flax receiving LuTFL1 alleles from northerly wild flax populations. Compared to a background of population structure of flaxes over latitude, the LuTFL1 alleles display a level of differentiation that is consistent with selection for an allele III in the north. We demonstrate through heterologous expression in Arabidopsis thaliana that LuTFL1 is a functional homolog of TFL1 in A. thaliana capable of changing both flowering time and plant architecture. We conclude that specialized fiber flax types could have formed as a consequence of a natural adaptation of cultivated flax to higher latitudes.",

    "abstract": "During early stages of speciation, genome divergence is greatly influenced by gene flow. As populations diverge, geography can allow or restrict gene flow in the form of barriers. Current geography, e.g. whether sister species are allopatric or parapatric, is often used to predict the potential for gene flow during the divergence process. We test the validity of this assumption in eight meliphagoid bird species codistributed across four regions. These regions are separated by known biogeographic barriers within and between northern Australia and Papua New Guinea. We find that bird populations across the same barrier have a range of divergence levels and probability of gene flow regardless of range connectivity. Geographic distance and maximum range connectivity over time can better predict divergence and probability of gene flow than whether populations are currently allopatric or parapatric. We also find support for a nonlinear decrease of the probability of gene flow during the divergence process. This implies that although gene flow influences divergence early in speciation, other factors associated with higher divergence restrict gene flow later in speciation. Current geography may then mislead inferences regarding potential for gene flow during speciation under a complex and dynamic history of geographic and reproductive isolation.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal is one of the strategies for organisms to deal with climate change and habitat degradation. Therefore, investigating the effects of dispersal evolution on natural populations is of considerable interest to ecologists and conservation biologists. Although it is known that dispersal itself can evolve due to selection, the behavioral, life-history and metabolic consequences of dispersal evolution are not well understood. Here we explore these issues by subjecting four outbred laboratory populations of Drosophila melanogaster to selection for increased dispersal. The dispersal-selected populations had similar values of body size, fecundity and longevity as the non-selected lines (controls), but evolved significantly greater locomotor activity, exploratory tendency, and aggression. Untargeted metabolomic fingerprinting through NMR spectroscopy suggested that the selected flies evolved elevated cellular respiration characterized by greater amounts of glucose, AMP and NAD. Concurrent evolution of higher level of Octopamine and other neurotransmitters indicate a possible mechanism for the behavioural changes in the selected lines. We discuss the generalizability of our findings in the context of observations from natural populations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the evolution of metabolome due to selection for dispersal and its connection to dispersal syndrome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication creates a second copy of a gene either in tandem to the ancestral locus or dispersed to another chromosomal location. When the ancestral copy of a dispersed duplicate is lost from the genome, it creates the appearance that the gene was \\\"relocated\\\" from the ancestral locus to the derived location. Gene relocations may be as common as canonical dispersed duplications in which both the ancestral and derived copies are retained. Relocated genes appear to be under more selective constraints than the derived copies of canonical duplications, and they are possibly as conserved as single-copy non-relocated genes. To test this hypothesis, we combined comparative genomics, population genetics, gene expression, and functional analyses to assess the selection pressures acting on relocated, duplicated, and non-relocated single-copy genes in Drosophila genomes. We find that relocated genes evolve faster than single-copy non-relocated genes, and there is no evidence that this faster evolution is driven by positive selection. In addition, relocated genes are less essential for viability and male fertility than single-copy non-relocated genes, suggesting that relocated genes evolve fast because of relaxed selective constraints. However, relocated genes evolve slower than the derived copies of canonical dispersed duplicated genes. We therefore conclude that relocated genes are under more selective constraints than canonical duplicates, but are not as conserved as single-copy non-relocated genes.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYSynesthesia is a condition wherein one sense is evoked by another. Recent studies suggested a higher incidence of synesthesia among people with autism. However, the underlying circuit mechanism of the comorbidity remains unknown partly due to lack of animal models. Here, we measured auditory response of primary visual cortex (V1) in mouse models to estimate the mixture level of their senses. We found that the V1 auditory response exhibits bidirectional cross-modal plasticity and depends on the level of GABA-mediated inhibition. Analysis of the V1 auditory response in autistic BTBR strain revealed its contralateral bias as in primary auditory cortex, and the auditory evoked field potential was enhanced at gamma range. Furthermore, early sound-driven spike modulation of V1 was commonly shifted toward enhancement in three different autism models (BTBR, NL3 R451C, SCN1A R1407X). Disruption of excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) circuit balance is prevalent among autistic people and mouse models. Thus, our results suggest that E/I imbalance may be the common circuit dysfunction for both autism and synesthesia.",

    "abstract": "Early alcohol use initiation predicts onset of alcohol use disorders (AUD) in adulthood. However, little is known about developmental trajectories of alcohol use initiation or their putative biological and environmental correlates. Here we report the results of latent class analyses identifying two trajectories of alcohol use initiation in a prospective study of adolescents selected for the presence or absence of familial risk for depression at baseline. The latent class analyses identified two distinct patterns of initiation: early initiators (EI; n=32) who reported greater baseline alcohol use (M = 1.12, SE = .35) and exhibited a more rapid rate of change in use between baseline and each follow up wave (M = 4.43, SE = .94); and in contrast, late initiators (LI; n=298) who reported lower baseline use (M = .23, SE = .03) and exhibited a slower rate of change between baseline and each of the subsequent follow up waves (M = .12, SE = .03). Early initiators had more positive expectancies regarding alcohol (p = .002 - p = .005) and reported higher levels of stressful life events during the year prior to baseline assessment (p = .001). Additionally, fMRI analyses revealed that EI displayed heightened threat-related amygdala activity at baseline compared to LI (p = .001), but no differences in reward-related ventral striatum activity. Lastly survival analyses revealed that EI initiators were 6.7 times more likely to develop an AUD by age 19 when compared to the LI (p = .005). These patterns, which were independent of broad familial risk for depression, suggest that early initiation of alcohol use during adolescence associated with later risk for AUD is reflected in both higher levels of stressful life events and higher neural reactivity to threat, the combination of which may inform ongoing efforts to prevent persistent dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "1.The problem of interest here is the study of brain functional and effective connectivity based non-invasive EEG-MEG inverse solution time series. These signals generally have low spatial resolution, such that an estimated signal at any one site is an instantaneous linear mixture of the true, actual, unobserved signals across all cortical sites. False connectivity can result from analysis of these low-resolution signals. Recent efforts toward \\\"unmixing\\\" have been developed, under the name of \\\"leakage correction\\\". One recent noteworthy approach is that by Colclough et al (2015 NeuroImage, 117:439-448), which forces the inverse solution signals to have zero cross-correlation at lag zero. One goal is to show that Colcloughs method produces false human connectomes under very broad conditions. The second major goal is to develop a new solution, that appropriately \\\"unmixes\\\" the inverse solution signals, based on innovations orthogonalization. The new method first fits a multivariate autoregression to the inverse solution signals, giving the mixed innovations. Second, the mixed innovations are orthogonalized. Third, the mixed and orthogonalized innovations allow the estimation of the \\\"unmixing\\\" matrix, which is then finally used to \\\"unmix\\\" the inverse solution signals. It is shown that under very broad conditions, the new method produces proper human connectomes, even when the signals are not generated by an autoregressive model.",

    "abstract": "Advances in neuroimaging and sequencing techniques provide an unprecedented opportunity to map the function of brain regions and to identify the roots of psychiatric diseases. However, the results generated by most neuroimaging studies, i.e., activated clusters/regions or functional connectivities between brain regions, frequently cannot be conveniently and systematically interpreted, rendering the biological meaning unclear. We describe a Brain Annotation Toolbox (BAT), a toolbox that helps to generate functional and genetic annotations for neuroimaging results. The toolbox can take data from brain regions identified with an atlas, or from brain regions identified as activated in tasks, or from functional connectivity links or networks of links. Then, the voxel-level functional description from the Neurosynth database and the gene expression profile from the Allen Brain Atlas are used to generate functional and genetic knowledge for such region-level data. Parametric (Fishers exact test) or non-parametric (permutation test) statistical tests are adopted to identify significantly related functional descriptors and genes for the neuroimaging results. The validity of the approach is demonstrated by showing that the functional and genetic annotations for specific brain regions are consistent with each other; and further the region by region functional similarity network and gene co-expression networks are highly correlated for many major brain atlases. One application of BAT is to help provide functional and genetic annotations for the newly discovered regions with unknown functions, e.g., the 97 new regions identified in the Human Connectome Project. Importantly too, this toolbox can help understand differences between patients with psychiatric disorders and controls, and this is demonstrated using data for schizophrenia and autism, for which the functional and genetic annotations for the neuroimaging data differences between patients and controls are consistent with each other and help with the interpretation of the differences.",

Consistent with novelty detection, we found greater activation for pseudowords relative to trained words bilaterally in the parietotemporal cortex.

Brain responses to neutral faces were modulated by the valence of preceding pictures, with greater activation for faces following negative (vs. positive) pictures in the amygdala, dorsomedial and lateral prefrontal cortex, ventral visual cortices, posterior superior temporal sulcus, and angular gyrus. Three days after the MRI scan, participants rated their memory and liking of previously encountered neutral faces. Individuals higher in trait positive affect and emotional reappraisal rated faces as more likable when preceded by emotionally arousing (negative or positive) pictures. Additionally, greater amygdala responses to neutral faces preceded by positively valenced pictures were associated with greater memory for these faces three days later. Collectively, these results reveal individual differences in how emotions spill over onto the processing of unrelated social stimuli, resulting in persistent and affectively biased evaluations of such stimuli.",

Using these promoters, we built a CRISPR/dCas9-based feedback regulation system that automatically adjusts synthetic construct expression in response to burden.

    "abstract": "Reconstruction of biological networks for topological analyses helps in correlation identification between various types of biomarkers. These networks have been vital components of System Biology in present era. Genes are the basic physical and structural unit of heredity. Genes act as instructions to make molecules called proteins. Alterations in the normal sequence of these genes are the root cause of various diseases and cancer is the prominent example disease caused by gene alteration or mutation. These slight alterations can be detected by microarray analysis. The high throughput data obtained by microarray experiments aid scientists in reconstructing cancer specific gene regulatory networks. The purpose of experiment performed is to find out the overlapping of the gene expression profiles of breast and lung cancer data, so that the common hub genes can be sifted and utilized as drug targets which could be used for the treatment of diseased conditions. In this study, first the differentially expressed genes have been identified (lung cancer and breast cancer), followed by a filtration approach and most significant genes are chosen using paired t-test and gene regulatory network construction. The obtained result has been checked and validated with the available databases and literature.",

    "abstract": "Abstract.Microarray technology has unlocked doors to a multitude of open analysis problems that if conceived with efficacy may uncover varied genotypic and phenotypic traits. Algorithms belonging to different cultures in computer science have been applied to gene expression data to derive correlation and stratification parameters. While most outcomes are subject to clinical validation, majority of which get declined, the search for the precisely targeted therapeutic agents is still on. This paper is an effort in the similar direction and strives to delineate genes with significant stromal signatures. We suggest a corroborative indulgence of a human laterality disorder gene, CCDC11 in the metastasis, in addition to the role of WDR88 and ARPP21 genes has been further materialized in the analysis. Another standout aspect of the study has been the associated implications of the genes in rare disorders of male breast and female prostate cancers. There is also a threshold proposal that stratifies \\\"safe\\\" expression space for genes. Complimentarily, the manuscript serves as an expedient protocol for anyone seeking microarray data analysis, particularly in R.",

    "abstract": "X-linked diseases typically exhibit more severe phenotypes in males than females. In contrast, Protocadherin 19 (PCDH19) mutations cause epilepsy in heterozygous females but spare hemizygous males. The cellular mechanism responsible for this unique pattern of X-linked inheritance is unknown. We show that PCDH19 contributes to highly specific combinatorial adhesion codes such that mosaic expression of Pcdh19 in heterozygous female mice leads to striking sorting between WT PCDH19- and null PCDH19-expressing cells in the developing cortex, correlating with altered network activity. Complete deletion of PCDH19 in heterozygous mice abolishes abnormal cell sorting and restores normal network activity. Furthermore, we identify variable cortical malformations in PCDH19 epilepsy patients. Our results highlight the role of PCDH19 in determining specific adhesion codes during cortical development and how disruption of these codes is associated with the unique X-linked inheritance of PCDH19 epilepsy.",
