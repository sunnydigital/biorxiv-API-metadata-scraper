    "abstract": "Various resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) measures have been developed to characterize intrinsic brain activity. While each of these measures has gained a growing presence in the literature, questions remain regarding the common and unique aspects these indices capture. The present work provided a comprehensive examination of inter-individual variation and intra-individual temporal variation for commonly used measures, including fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, regional homogeneity, voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity, network centrality and global signal correlation. Regardless of whether examining intra-individual or inter-individual variation, we found that these definitionally distinct R-fMRI indices tend to exhibit a relatively high degree of covariation, which doesnt exist in phase randomized surrogate data. As a measure of intrinsic brain function, concordance for R-fMRI indices was negatively correlated with age across individuals (i.e., concordance among functional indices decreased with age). To understand the functional significance of concordance, we noted that higher concordance was generally associated with higher strengths of R-fMRI indices, regardless of whether looking through the lens of inter-individual (i.e., high vs. low concordance participants) or intra-individual (i.e., high vs. low concordance states identified via temporal dynamic analyses) differences. We also noted a linear increase in functional concordance together with the R-fMRI indices through the scan, which may suggest a decrease in arousal. The current study demonstrated an enriched picture regarding the relationship among the R-fMRI indices, as well as provided new insights in examining dynamic states within and between individuals.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms and evolutionary dynamics of sex-determination systems are of particular interest in insect vectors of human pathogens like mosquitoes because novel control strategies aim to convert pathogen-transmitting females into non-biting males, or rely on accurate sexing for the release of sterile males. In Aedes aegypti, the main vector of dengue and Zika viruses, sex determination is governed by a dominant male-determining locus, previously thought to reside within a small, non-recombining, sex-determining region (SDR) of an otherwise homomorphic sex chromosome. Here, we provide evidence that sex chromosomes in Ae. aegypti are genetically differentiated between males and females over a region much larger than the SDR. Our linkage mapping intercrosses failed to detect recombination between X and Y chromosomes over a 123-Mbp region (40% of their physical length) containing the SDR. This region of reduced male recombination overlapped with a smaller 63-Mbp region (20% of the physical length of the sex chromosomes) displaying high male-female genetic differentiation in unrelated wild population from Brazil and Australia and in a reference laboratory strain originating from Africa. In addition, the sex-differentiated genomic region was associated with a significant excess of male-to-female heterozygosity and contained a small cluster of loci consistent with Y-specific null alleles. We demonstrate that genetic differentiation between sex chromosomes is sufficient to assign individuals to their correct sex with high accuracy. We also show how data on allele frequency differences between sexes can be used to estimate linkage disequilibrium between loci and the sex-determining locus. Our discovery of large-scale genetic differentiation between sex chromosomes in Ae. aegypti lays a new foundation for mapping and population genomic studies, as well as for mosquito control strategies targeting the sex-determination pathway.",

Most organisms thrive within a temperature range that rarely exceeds [~] 30{degrees}C, but the deep subsurface bacterium Kosmotoga olearia can grow over a temperature range of 59{degrees}C (20{degrees}C -79{degrees}C). To identify genes correlated with this flexible phenotype, we compared transcriptomes of K. olearia cultures grown at its optimal 65{degrees}C to those at 30{degrees}C, 40{degrees}C, and 77{degrees}C. The temperature treatments affected expression of 573 of 2,224 K. olearia genes. Notably, this transcriptional response elicits re-modeling of the cellular membrane and changes in metabolism, with increased expression of genes involved in energy and carbohydrate metabolism at high temperatures and up-regulation of amino acid metabolism at lower temperatures. At sub-optimal temperatures, many transcriptional changes were similar to those observed in mesophilic bacteria at physiologically low temperatures, including up-regulation of typical cold stress genes and ribosomal proteins. Comparative genomic analysis of additional Thermotogae genomes, indicate that one of K. olearia's strategies for low temperature growth is increased copy number of some typical cold response genes through duplication and/or lateral acquisition. At 77{degrees}C one third of the up-regulated genes are of hypothetical function, indicating that many features of high temperature growth are unknown.",

    "abstract": "Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are utilized extensively for biomedical imaging, sensing, and therapeutic applications, yet the molecular weight of UCNPs has not previously been reported. We present a theory based upon the crystal structure of UCNPs to estimate the molecular weight of UCNPs: enabling insight into UCNP molecular weight for the first time. We estimate the theoretical molecular weight of various UCNPs reported in the literature, predicting that spherical NaYF4 UCNPs {small tilde} 10 nm in diameter will be {small tilde}1 MDa (i.e. 106 g/mol), whereas UCNPs {small tilde} 45 nm in diameter will be {small tilde}100 MDa (i.e. 108 g/mol). We also predict that hexagonal crystal phase UCNPs will be of greater molecular weight than cubic crystal phase UCNPs. Additionally we find that a Gaussian UCNP diameter distribution will correspond to a lognormal UCNP molecular weight distribution. Our approach could potentially be generalised to predict the molecular weight of other arbitrary crystalline nanoparticles: as such, we provide standalone graphic user interfaces to calculate the molecular weight both UCNPs and arbitrary crystalline nanoparticles. We expect knowledge of UCNP molecular weight to be of wide utility in biomedical applications where reporting UCNP quantity in absolute numbers or molarity will be beneficial for inter-study comparison and repeatability.",

Hitherto, the SecYEG/Sec61 translocon, existing in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, represents the most intensively studied one. According to the current perception, both periplasmic and {beta}-barrel outer membrane proteins ({beta}-barrel OMPs) are translocated via the SecYEG translocon in bacterial cells, although direct living cell evidences remain lacking. Here, mainly via in vivo protein photo-crosslinking analysis, we revealed that the never reported membrane-integrated SecAN protein apparently functions as the translocon for {beta}-barrel OMPs. Additionally, SecAN contains a GXXXG motif known for mediating protein interactions in biomembranes, and processing of {beta}-barrel OMP precursors was severely affected in cells producing an assembly-defective SecAN variant resulted from the GXXXG motif mutations. Furthermore, SecAN was demonstrated to directly interact with the Bam complex, thus likely be a part of the supercomplex that we revealed earlier to be responsible for {beta}-barrel OMP biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Human romantic partners tend to have similar physical traits1, but the mechanisms causing this homogamy are controversial. One potential explanation is direct matching to own characteristics2,3. Alternatively, studies showing similarity between parent and partner4,5 support positive sexual imprinting6,7, where individuals are more likely to choose mates with the physical characteristics of their other-sex parent. This interpretation has been strongly criticized because the same pattern could also be caused by sex-linked heritable preferences3, where similarity in appearance between an individuals partner and their other-sex parent is caused by similarity in preferences between the individual and their same-sex parent. The relationships among own, parents and same-sex partners eye color provide an elegant test of these hypotheses, which each postulate a different best predictor of partners eye color. While the matching hypothesis predicts this will be own eye color, the sex-linked heritable preference hypothesis predicts this will be the other-sex parents eye color and the positive sexual imprinting hypothesis predicts this will be the partner-sex parents eye color. Here we show that partner eye color was best predicted by the partner-sex parents eye color. Our results provide clear evidence against matching and sex-linked heritable preference hypotheses, and support the positive sexual imprinting hypothesis of the relationship between own and partners eye color.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntegrating rare variation from trio family and case/control studies has successfully implicated specific genes contributing to risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability (ID), developmental disorders (DD), and epilepsy (EPI). For schizophrenia (SCZ), however, while sets of genes have been implicated through study of rare variation, only two risk genes have been identified.\\n\\nMethodsWe used hierarchical Bayesian modeling of rare variant genetic architecture to estimate mean effect sizes and risk-gene proportions, analyzing the largest available collection of whole exome sequence (WES) data for schizophrenia (1,077 trios, 6,699 cases and 13,028 controls), and data for four NDDs (ASD, ID, DD, and EPI; total 10,792 trios, and 4,058 cases and controls).\\n\\nResultsFor SCZ, we estimate 1,551 risk genes, more risk genes and weaker effects than for NDDs. We provide power analyses to predict the number of risk gene discoveries as more data become available, demonstrating greater value of case-control over trio samples. We confirm and augment prior risk gene and gene set enrichment results for SCZ and NDDs. In particular, we detected 98 new DD risk genes at FDR < 0.05. Correlations of risk-gene posterior probabilities are high across four NDDs ({rho} > 0.55), but low between SCZ and the NDDs ({rho} < 0.3). In depth analysis of 288 NDD genes shows highly significant protein-protein interaction (PPI) network connectivity, and functionally distinct PPI subnetworks based on pathway enrichments, single-cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) cell types and multi-region developmental brain RNA-seq.\\n\\nConclusionsWe have extended a pipeline used in ASD studies and applied it to infer rare genetic parameters for SCZ and four NDDs. We find many new DD risk genes, supported by gene set enrichment and PPI network connectivity analyses. We find greater similarity among NDDs than between NDDs and SCZ. NDD gene subnetworks are implicated in postnatally expressed presynaptic and postsynaptic genes, and for transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation in prenatal neural progenitor and stem cells.",

However, compared to intracellular signal transduction networks, the function and engineering principles of cell-to-cell communication networks are far less understood. Here, we study cell-to-cell communication networks using a framework that models the input-to-output relationship of intracellular signal transduction networks with a single function--the response-time distribution. We identify a prototypic response-time distribution--the gamma distribution--arising in both experimental data sets and mathematical models of signal-transduction pathways. We find that simple cell-to-cell communication circuits can generate bimodal response-time distributions, and can control synchronization and delay of cell-population responses independently. We apply our modeling approach to explain otherwise puzzling data on cytokine secretion onset times in T cells. Our approach can be used to predict communication network structure using experimentally accessible input-to-output measurements and without detailed knowledge of intermediate steps.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have suggested associations between depression and cardiometabolic abnormalities or diseases, such as coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. However, little is known about the mechanism underlying this comorbidity, and whether the relationship differs by depression subtypes. Using the polygenic risk score (PRS) approach and linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression, we investigated the genetic overlap of various depression-related phenotypes with a comprehensive panel of 20 cardiometabolic traits. GWAS results for major depressive disorder (MDD) were taken from the PGC and CONVERGE studies, with the latter focusing on severe melancholic depression. GWAS results on general depressive symptoms (DS) and neuroticism were also included. We also identified the shared genetic variants and inferred enriched pathways. In addition, we looked for drugs over-represented among the top shared genes, with an aim to finding repositioning opportunities for comorbidities.\\n\\nWe found significant polygenic sharing between MDD, DS and neuroticism with various cardiometabolic traits. In general, positive polygenic associations with CV risks were observed for most depression phenotypes except MDD-CONVERGE. Counterintuitively, PRS representing severe melancholic depression was associated with reduced CV risks. Enrichment analyses of shared SNPs revealed many interesting pathways, such as those related to inflammation, that underlie the comorbidity of depressive and cardiometabolic traits. Using a gene-set analysis approach, we also revealed a number of repositioning candidates, some of which were supported by prior studies, such as bupropion and glutathione. Our study highlights shared genetic bases of depression with cardiometabolic traits, and suggests the associations vary by depression subtypes. To our knowledge, this is the also first study to make use of human genomic data to guide drug discovery or repositioning for comorbid disorders.",

TRIBE expresses an RBP of interest fused to the catalytic domain (cd) of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR and performs Adenosine-to-Inosine editing on RNA targets of the RBP. However, target identification is limited by the low editing efficiency of the ADARcd. Here we describe HyperTRIBE, which carries a previously characterized hyperactive mutation (E488Q) of the ADARcd. HyperTRIBE identifies dramatically more editing sites, many of which are also edited by TRIBE but at a much lower editing frequency. HyperTRIBE therefore more faithfully recapitulates the known binding specificity of its RBP than TRIBE. In addition, separating RNA binding from the enhanced editing activity of the HyperTRIBE ADAR catalytic domain sheds light on the mechanism of ADARcd editing as well as the enhanced activity of the HyperADARcd.",

    "abstract": "Plant species have repeatedly evolved recognition systems between pollen and pistils that identify and reject inappropriate matings. Two of the most important systems recognize self-pollen and interspecific pollen. Outstanding questions are whether and how these two recognition systems are linked and if this association could constrain the evolution of mate choice. Our study characterizes variation in self and interspecific incompatibility in the native range of the Texas wildflower Phlox drummondii. We found quantitative variation in self-incompatibility and demonstrate that this variation is significantly correlated with variation in incompatibility with its close congener P. cuspidata. Furthermore, we find strong evidence that self and interspecific incompatibility involve common mechanisms of pollen adhesion or early pollen-tube germination. Finally, we show that P. drummondii populations that co-occur and hybridize with P. cuspidata have significantly higher interspecific incompatibility and self-incompatibility than isolated P. drummondii populations. This geographic variation suggests that the evolution of self-compatibility is constrained by selection favoring interspecific incompatibility to reduce maladaptive hybridization. To our knowledge this is the strongest evidence that a correlation between variation in self and interspecific incompatibilities could influence the evolution of pollen recognition across the range of a species.",

    "abstract": "Background & MethodsThe ICONIC project has developed an automated high-throughput pipeline to generate HIV nearly full-length genomes (NFLG, i.e. from gag to nef) from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The pipeline was applied to 420 HIV samples collected at University College London Hospital and Barts Health NHS Trust (London) and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Cambridge). Consensus genomes were generated and subtyped using COMET, and unique recombinants were studied with jpHMM and SimPlot. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed using RAxML to identify transmission networks using the Cluster Picker.\\n\\nResultsThe pipeline generated sequences of at least 1Kb of length (median=7.4Kb) for 375 out of the 420 samples (89%), with 174 (46.4%) being NFLG. A total of 365 sequences (169 of them NFLG) corresponded to unique subjects and were included in the down-stream analyses. The most frequent HIV subtypes were B (n=149, 40.8%) and C (n=77, 21.1%) and the circulating recombinant form CRF02_AG (n=32, 8.8%). We found 14 different CRFs (n=66, 18.1%) and multiple URFs (n=32, 8.8%) that involved recombination between 12 different subtypes/CRFs. The most frequent URFs were B/CRF01_AE (4 cases) and A1/D, B/C, and B/CRF02_AG (3 cases each). Most URFs (19/26, 73%) lacked breakpoints in the PR+RT pol region, rendering them undetectable if only that was sequenced. Twelve (37.5%) of the URFs could have emerged within the UK, whereas the rest were probably imported from sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and South America. For 2 URFs we found highly similar pol sequences circulating in the UK. We detected 31 phylogenetic clusters using the full dataset: 25 pairs (mostly subtypes B and C), 4 triplets and 2 quadruplets. Some of these were not consistent across different genes due to inter- and intra-subtype recombination. Clusters involved 70 sequences, 19.2% of the dataset.\\n\\nConclusionsThe initial analysis of genome sequences detected substantial hidden variability in the London HIV epidemic. Analysing full genome sequences, as opposed to only PR+RT, identified previously undetected recombinants. It provided a more reliable description of CRFs (that would be otherwise misclassified) and transmission clusters.",

In this work, we show that FrzCD directly binds to the nucleoid with its N-terminal positively charged tail and recruits active signaling complexes at this location. The FrzCD binding to the nucleoid occur in a DNA-sequence independent manner and leads to the formation of multiple distributed clusters that explore constrained areas. This organization might be required for cooperative interactions between clustered receptors as observed in membrane-bound chemosensory arrays.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn this work, we show that the cytoplasmic chemoreceptor of the Frz chemosensory system, FrzCD, does not bind the cytoplasmic membrane like most MCPs but bind the bacterial nucleoid directly, thus forming distributed protein clusters also containing the Frz kinase. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that DNA-binding is not sequence-specific and is mediated by a basic aminoacid sequence of the FrzCD N-terminal domain. The deletion of this motif abolishes FrzCD DNA-binding and cooperativity in the response to signals. This work shows the importance of the nucleoid in the organization and functioning of cytoplasmic signaling systems in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive transcription generates many unstable non-coding transcripts in budding yeast. The transcription of such noncoding RNAs, in particular antisense RNAs (asRNAs), has been shown in a few examples to repress the expression of the associated mRNAs. Yet, such mechanism is not known to commonly contribute to the regulation of a given class of genes. Using a mutant context that stabilised pervasive transcripts, we observed that the least expressed mRNAs during the exponential phase were associated with high levels of asRNAs. These asRNAs also overlapped their corresponding gene promoters with a much higher frequency than average. Interrupting antisense transcription of a subset of genes corresponding to quiescence-enriched mRNAs restored their expression. The underlying mechanism acts in cis and involves several chromatin modifiers. Our results convey that transcription interference represses up to 30% of the 590 least expressed genes, which includes 163 genes with quiescence-enriched mRNAs. We also found that pervasive transcripts constitute a higher fraction of the transcriptome in quiescence relative to the exponential phase, consistent with gene expression itself playing an important role to suppress pervasive transcription. Accordingly, the HIS1 asRNA, normally only present in quiescence, is expressed in exponential phase upon HIS1 mRNA transcription interruption.",

    "abstract": "Single cell expression profiling reveals the molecular states of individual cells with unprecedented detail. However, because these methods destroy cells in the process of analysis, they cannot measure how gene expression changes over time. But some information on dynamics is present in the data: the continuum of molecular states in the population can reflect the trajectory of a typical cell. Many methods for extracting single cell dynamics from population data have been proposed. However, all such attempts face a common limitation: for any measured distribution of cell states, there are multiple dynamics that could give rise to it, and by extension, multiple possibilities for underlying mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, we describe the aspects of gene expression dynamics that cannot be inferred from a static snapshot alone and identify assumptions necessary to constrain a unique solution for cell dynamics from static snapshots. We translate these constraints into a practical algorithmic approach, Population Balance Analysis (PBA), which makes use of a method from spectral graph theory to solve a class of high dimensional differential equations. We use simulations to show the strengths and limitations of PBA, and then apply it to single-cell profiles of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs). Cell state predictions from this analysis agree with HPC fate assays reported in several papers over the past two decades. By highlighting the fundamental limits on dynamic inference faced by any method, our framework provides a rigorous basis for dynamic interpretation of a gene expression continuum and clarifies best experimental designs for trajectory reconstruction from static snapshot measurements.\\n\\nSignificanceSeeing a snapshot of individuals at different stages of a process can reveal what the process would look like for a single individual over time. Biologists apply this principle to infer temporal sequences of gene expression states in cells from measurements made at a single moment in time. However, these inferences are fundamentally under-determined. Using a conservation law, we enumerate reasons that there is no unique dynamics associated with a single snapshot, limiting our ability to infer gene regulatory mechanisms. We then propose a method for dynamic inference that provides a unique dynamic solution under defined approximations and apply it to data from bone marrow stem cells. Overall, this study introduces formal biophysical approaches to single cell bioinformatics.\\n\\nClassificationBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES / Systems Biology",

    "abstract": "p21WAF1/CIP1 is a broad-acting cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Its stability is essential for proper cell cycle progression and cell fate decision. Ubiquitylation by the multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases complex is the major regulatory mechanism of p21, which induces p21 degradation. However, it is unclear whether ubiquitylated p21 can be recycled. In this study, we report USP11 as a deubiquitylase of p21. In the nucleus, USP11 binds to p21, catalyzes the removal of polyubiquitin chains conjugated onto p21 and stabilizes p21 protein. As a result, USP11 reverses p21 polyubiquitylation and degradation mediated by SCFSKP2, CRL4CDT2 and APC/CCDT20 in a cell cycle-independent manner. Loss of USP11 causes the destabilization of p21 and induces the G1/S transition in unperturbed cells. Furthermore, p21 accumulation mediated by DNA damage is completely abolished in cells depleted of USP11, which results in abrogation of the G2 checkpoint and induction of apoptosis. Functionally, USP11-mediated stabilization of p21 inhibits cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo. These findings reveal an important mechanism by which p21 can be stabilized by direct deubiquitylation and pinpoint a crucial role of the USP11-p21 axis in regulating cell cycle progression and DNA damage responses.",

    "abstract": "A major application for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has been the emerging field of causal inference using Mendelian randomization (MR), where the causal effect between a pair of traits can be estimated using only summary level data. MR depends on SNPs exhibiting vertical pleiotropy, where the SNP influences an outcome phenotype only through an exposure phenotype. Issues arise when this assumption is violated due to SNPs exhibiting horizontal pleiotropy. We demonstrate that across a range of pleiotropy models, instrument selection will be increasingly liable to selecting invalid instruments as GWAS sample sizes continue to grow. Methods have been developed in an attempt to protect MR from different patterns of horizontal pleiotropy, and here we have designed a mixture-of-experts machine learning framework (MR-MoE 1.0) that predicts the most appropriate model to use for any specific causal analysis, improving on both power and false discovery rates. Using the approach, we systematically estimated the causal effects amongst 2407 phenotypes. Almost 90% of causal estimates indicated some level of horizontal pleiotropy. The causal estimates are organised into a publicly available graph database (http://eve.mrbase.org), and we use it here to highlight the numerous challenges that remain in automated causal inference.",

    "abstract": "Robustness in development allows for the accumulation of neutral genetically based variation in expression, and here will be termed  genetic stochasticity . This largely neutral variation is potentially important for both evolution and complex disease phenotypes. However, it has generally only been investigated as variation exhibited in the response to large genetic perturbations. In addition, work on variation in gene expression has similarly generally been limited to being spatial, or quantitative, but because of technical restrictions not both. Here we bridge these gaps by investigating replicated quantitative spatial gene expression using rigorous statistical models, in different genotypes, sexes, and species (Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans). Using this type of quantitative approach with developmental data allows for effective comparison among conditions, including health versus disease. We apply this approach to the morphogenetic furrow, a wave of differentiation that sweeps across the developing eye disc. Within the morphogenetic furrow, we focus on four conserved morphogens, hairy, atonal, hedgehog, and Delta. Hybridization chain reaction quantitatively measures spatial gene expression, co-staining for all four genes simultaneously and with minimal effort. We find considerable variation in the spatial expression pattern of these genes in the eye between species, genotypes, and sexes. We also find that there has been evolution of the regulatory relationship between these genes. Lastly, we show that the spatial interrelationships of these genes evolved between species in the morphogenetic furrow. This is essentially the first  population genetics of development as we are able to evaluate wild type differences in spatial and quantitative gene expression at the level of genotype, species and sex.",

    "abstract": "The progressive maturation of cells down differentiation lineages is controlled by collaborative interactions between networks of extracellular signals and intracellular transcription factors. In the vertebrate spinal cord, FGF, Wnt and Retinoic Acid signaling pathways regulate the progressive caudal-to-rostral maturation of neural progenitors by regulating a poorly understood gene regulatory network of transcription factors. We have mapped out this gene regulatory network in the chicken pre-neural tube, identifying CDX4 as a dual-function core component that simultaneously regulates gradual loss of cell potency and acquisition of differentiation states: in a caudal-to-rostral direction, CDX4 represses the early neural differentiation marker Nkx1.2 and promotes the late neural differentiation marker Pax6. Significantly, CDX4 prevents premature PAX6-dependent neural differentiation by blocking Ngn2 activation. This regulation of CDX4 over Pax6 is restricted to the rostral pre-neural tube by Retinoic Acid signaling. Together, our results show that in the spinal cord, CDX4 is part of the gene regulatory network controlling the sequential and progressive transition of states from high to low potency during neural progenitor maturation. Given CDX well-known involvement in Hox gene regulation, we propose that CDX factors coordinate the maturation and axial specification of neural progenitor cells during spinal cord development.",

One recent noteworthy approach is that by Colclough et al (2015 NeuroImage, 117:439-448), which forces the inverse solution signals to have zero cross-correlation at lag zero. One goal is to show that Colcloughs method produces false human connectomes under very broad conditions. The second major goal is to develop a new solution, that appropriately \\\"unmixes\\\" the inverse solution signals, based on innovations orthogonalization. The new method first fits a multivariate autoregression to the inverse solution signals, giving the mixed innovations. Second, the mixed innovations are orthogonalized. Third, the mixed and orthogonalized innovations allow the estimation of the \\\"unmixing\\\" matrix, which is then finally used to \\\"unmix\\\" the inverse solution signals.

    "abstract": "The high prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV), the most common sexually transmitted infection, arises from the coexistence of over 200 genetically distinct types. Accurately predicting the impact of vaccines that target multiple types requires understanding the factors that determine HPV diversity. The diversity of many pathogens is driven by type-specific or \\\"homologous\\\" immunity, which promotes the spread of variants to which hosts have little immunity. To test for homologous immunity and to identify mechanisms determining HPV transmission, we fitted nonlinear mechanistic models to longitudinal data on genital infections in unvaccinated men. Our results provide no evidence for homologous immunity, instead showing that infection with one HPV type strongly increases the risk of infection with that type for years afterwards. For HPV16, the type responsible for most HPV-related cancers, an initial infection increases the one-year probability of reinfection by 20-fold, and the probability of reinfection remains 14-fold higher two years later. This increased risk occurs in both sexually active and celibate men, suggesting that it arises from auto-inoculation, episodic reactivation of latent virus, or both. Overall our results show that high HPV prevalence and diversity can be explained by a combination of a lack of homologous immunity, frequent reinfections, weak competition between types, and variation in type fitness between host subpopulations. Due to the high risk of reinfection, vaccinating boys that have not yet been exposed may be crucial to reduce prevalence, but our results suggest that there may also be large benefits from vaccinating previously infected individuals.",

The authors reported a non-significant protective treatment effect of pre-emptive correction on access loss, while showing a significant protective effect on thrombosis rates conferred by pre-emptive correction. We revisit this analysis, including data extraction and effects of a heterogenous study population.\\n\\nMethodsWe repeated data extraction from all referenced publications in the meta-analysis by Ravani et al. and corrected event counts where applicable. We repeated the meta-analyses with access loss as the outcome for studies that recruited patients with arterio-venous fistulae (AVF) and grafts (AVG), respectively, using a random effects model with relative risk (RR) and risk difference (RD) of access loss as the outcomes of interest. We repeated data extraction from all referenced publications, and corrected event counts where applicable.\\n\\nResultsOur conclusions differ from the original findings in two ways. First, after some amendment of the event counts extracted from Mayer et al. (Vascular and Endovascular Surgery 1993), we find a significant overall positive effect of pre-emptive correction on arterio-venous access loss in the overall study population [RR 0.80 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.99), RD -0.07 (95% CI -0.12 to -0.02); Figure 1]. Secondly, we highlight the impact of heterogeneous study populations on the meta-analysis. Whereas the data do not conclusively show a benefit of pre-emptive correction for arteriovenous grafts (AVG; RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.69 - 1.11), they show a strong protective effect for arteriovenous fistulae (AVF; RR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.86).\\n\\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=128 SRC=\\\"FIGDIR/small/179580_fig1.gif\\\" ALT=\\\"Figure 1\\\">\\nView larger version (41K):\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@af3c13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@911a50org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@568cf1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f3c08_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1:C_FLOATNO Meta-analysis of access loss, overall and by access type using risk ratio (RR) as the measure of association.\\n\\nC_FIG\\n\\nDiscussion and ConclusionThese findings corroborate clinical arguments such as superior long-term patency of AVF and the nature of AVG failure that often involve infectious causes.

In addition to genes, genomes also contain a myriad of functional elements that control various steps in gene expression.

    "abstract": "Flying insects routinely forage in complex and cluttered sensory environments. Their search for a food or a pheromone source typically begins with a whiff of odor, which triggers a flight response, eventually bringing the insect in the vicinity of the odor source. The precise localization of an odor source, however, requires the use of both visual and olfactory modalities, aided by air currents that trap odor molecules into turbulent plumes, which the insects track. Here, we investigated odor tracking behavior in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) presented with low- or high-contrast visual landmarks, which were either paired with or separate from an attractive odor cue. These experiments were conducted either in a gentle air stream which generated odor plumes, or in still air in which odor dissipates uniformly in all directions. The trajectories of the flies revealed several novel features of their odor-tracking behavior in addition to those that have been previously documented (e.g. cast- and-surge maneuvers). First, in both moving and still air, odor-seeking flies rely on the co-occurrence of visual landmarks with olfactory cues to guide them to putative odorant objects in the decisive phase before landing. Second, flies abruptly decelerate when they encounter an odor plume, and thereafter steer towards nearby visual objects that had no inherent salience in the absence of odor. This indicates that the interception of an attractive odor increases their salience to nearby high-contrast visual landmarks. Third, flies adopt distinct odor tracking strategies during flight in moving vs. still air. Whereas they weave in and out of plumes towards an odor source when airflow is present, their approach is more gradual and incremental in still air. Both strategies are robust and flexible, and can ensure that the flies reliably find the odor source under diverse visual and airflow environments. Our experiments also indicate the possibility of an olfactory \\\" working memory\\\" that enables flies to continue their search even when the olfactory feedback is reduced or absent. Together, these results provide insights into how flies determine the precise location of an odor source.",

    "abstract": "Risk stratification model for lung cancer with gene expression profile is of great interest. Instead of the previously reported models based on individual prognostic genes, we aimed to develop a novel system-level risk stratification model for lung adenocarcinoma based on gene coexpression network. Using multiple microarray datasets obtained from lung adenocarcinoma, gene coexpression network analysis was performed to identify survival-related network modules. Representative genes of these network modules were selected and then, risk stratification model was constructed exploiting deep learning algorithm. The model was validated in two independent test cohorts. Survival analysis using univariate and multivariate Cox regression was performed using the output of the model to evaluate whether the model could predict patients overall survival independent of clinicopathological variables. Five network modules were significantly associated with patients survival. Considering prognostic significance and representativeness, genes of the two survival-related modules were selected for input data of the risk stratification model. The output of the model was significantly associated with patients overall survival in the two independent test sets as well as training set (p < 0.00001, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.02 for training set, test set 1 and 2, respectively). In multivariate analyses, the model was associated with patients prognosis independent of other clinical and pathological features. Our study presents a new perspective on incorporating gene coexpression networks into the gene expression signature, and the clinical application of deep learning in genomic data science for prognosis prediction.",

Although cohesin functions to tether DNA duplexes, the contribution of its individual domains to this activity remains poorly understood. We interrogated the Smc3p subunit of cohesin by random insertion mutagenesis. Analysis of a mutant in the Smc3p hinge revealed an unexpected role for this domain in cohesion maintenance and condensation. Further investigation revealed that the Smc3p hinge functions at a step following cohesins stable binding to chromosomes and independently of Smc3ps regulation by the Eco1p acetyltransferase. Hinge mutant phenotypes resemble loss of Pds5p, which binds opposite the hinge near Smc3ps head domain. We propose that a specific conformation of the Smc3p hinge and Pds5p cooperate to promote cohesion maintenance and condensation.",

This is in contrast with screening for common aneuploidies, for which noninvasive methods with a single maternal blood sample have become standard clinical practice.\\n\\nMethodsWe developed a protocol for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of inherited single gene disorders using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) from circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in maternal plasma. First, the amount of cfDNA and fetal fraction are determined using a panel of Taqman assays targeting high-variability SNPs. Second, the ratio of healthy and diseased alleles in maternal plasma are quantified using Taqman assays targeting the mutations carried by the parents. Two validation approaches of the mutation assay are presented.\\n\\nResultsWe collected blood samples from 9 pregnancies at risk for different single gene disorders including common conditions and rare metabolic disorders. We measured cases at risk of hemophilia, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, cystic fibrosis, {beta}-thalassemia, mevalonate kinase deficiency, acetylcholine receptor deficiency and DFNB1 nonsyndromic hearing loss. We correctly differentiated affected and unaffected pregnancies (2 affected, 7 unaffected), confirmed by neonatal testing. We successfully measured an affected pregnancy as early as week 11, and with a fetal fraction as low as 3.7{+/-}0.3%.\\n\\nConclusionOur method detects single nucleotide mutations of autosomal recessive diseases as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. This is of importance for metabolic disorders where early diagnosis can affect management of the disease and reduce complications and anxiety related to invasive testing.",

    "abstract": "Our voluntary grasping actions lie on a continuum between immediate action and waiting for the right moment, depending on the context. Therefore, studying grasping requires investigating how preparation time affects this process. Two macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performed a grasping task with a short instruction followed by an immediate or delayed go cue (0-1300 ms) while we recorded in parallel from neurons in the hand area (F5) of the ventral premotor cortex and the anterior intraparietal area (AIP). Initial population dynamics followed a fixed trajectory in the neural state space unique to each grip type, reflecting unavoidable preparation, then diverged depending on the delay. Although similar types of single unit responses were present in both areas, population activity in AIP stabilized within a unique memory state while F5 activity continued to evolve, tracking subjective anticipation of the go cue. Intriguingly, activity during movement initiation clustered into two trajectory clusters, corresponding to movements that were either  as fast as possible or withheld movements, demonstrating a widespread state shift in the fronto-parietal grasping network when movements must be withheld. Our results reveal how dissociation between static and dynamic components of movement preparation as well as differentiation between cortical areas is possible through population level analysis.\\n\\nSignificance StatementMany of our movements must occur with no warning, while others we can prepare in advance. Yet, its unclear how planning for movements along the spectrum between these two situations differs in the brain. Two macaque monkeys made reach to grasp movements after varying amounts of preparation time while we recorded from premotor and parietal cortex. We found that the initial response to a grasp instruction was specific to the required movement, but not the preparation time, reflecting required processing. However, when more preparation time was given, neural activity achieved unique states that likely related to withholding movements and anticipation of movement, which was more prevalent in premotor cortex, suggesting differing roles of premotor and parietal cortex in grasp planning.",

We find strong evidence of goal-directed dimensionality reduction within human ventromedial PFC during learning.

    "abstract": "BackgroundA major obstacle in the understanding of the functional anatomy of the claustrum has been, and continues to be, the contradiction surrounding its anatomical boundary and, in particular, its rostral (i.e. anterior to striatum), extent. In a recent review we highlighted gene expression-based evidence from the mouse brain which lends weight to the idea that the anatomical boundary of the claustrum does in fact extend rostral to the anterior apex of the striatum. In light of this evidence, in the present study, we have examined the expression of two genes that have previously been identified as having differential expression in the mouse claustrum, with the aim of: 1, establishing the true neuroanatomical boundaries of the rat claustrum; and 2, determining the efficacy of claustral marker expression in the histological verification of claustral electrode placement following electrophysiological recordings in awake behaving rats.\\n\\nMethodsThe expression profiles of two genes, crystallin mu (Crym) and guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), gamma 2 (Gng2) were assessed immunohistochemically in five male rats (one Wistar Kyoto (WK) and four Lister hooded (LH)). Prior to histological analysis, two of the rats had undergone surgical implantation of tetrodes targeting the putative rostral claustrum.\\n\\nResultsIn results that are consistent with those we have previously described in the mouse brain, expression of Crym in the rat brain was highly attenuated, or absent, in the claustrum, demarcating a nuclear boundary that extended considerably beyond the anterior apex of the striatum. In concordance, enriched expression of Gng2 was found in the claustrum, again extending equivalently rostral to the anterior apex of the striatum. The expression of claustral marker genes is a highly effective tool in the verification of electrophysiological electrode placement. Electrophysiological recordings from within this Gng2 and Crym-defined boundary of the rostral claustrum support previous reports of a spatial map in the rostral claustrum.\\n\\nConclusionsIt is now clear that the anatomical boundary of the rat claustrum does in fact extend into more frontal regions of the brain than has previously been asserted. The importance of these findings are considered in the context of the regional specificity of claustral function, anatomical connectivity and electrophysiological properties.",

    "abstract": "Preparing and executing grasping movements demands the coordination of sensory information across multiple scales. The position of an object, required hand shape, and which of our hands to extend must all be coordinated in parallel. The network formed by the macaque anterior intraparietal area (AIP) and hand area (F5) of the ventral premotor cortex is essential in the generation of grasping movements. Yet, the role of this circuit in hand selection is unclear. We recorded from 1342 single- and multi-units in AIP and F5 of two macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) during a delayed grasping task in which monkeys were instructed by a visual cue to perform power or precision grips on a handle presented in five different orientations with either the left or right hand, as instructed by an auditory tone. In AIP, intended hand use was only weakly represented during preparation, while hand use was robustly present in F5 during preparation. Interestingly, visual-centric handle orientation information dominated AIP, while F5 contained an additional body-centric frame during preparation and movement. Together, our results implicate F5 as a site of visuo-motor transformation and advocate a strong transition between hand-invariant and hand-specific representations in this parieto-frontal circuit.",

    "abstract": "Inference from fMRI data faces the challenge that the hemodynamic system, that relates the underlying neural activity to the observed BOLD fMRI signal, is not known. We propose a new Bayesian model for task fMRI data with the following features: (i) joint estimation of brain activity and the underlying hemodynamics, (ii) the hemodynamics is modeled nonparametrically with a Gaussian process (GP) prior guided by physiological information and (iii) the predicted BOLD is not necessarily generated by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. We place a GP prior directly on the predicted BOLD time series, rather than on the hemodynamic response function as in previous literature. This allows us to incorporate physiological information via the GP prior mean in a flexible way. The prior mean function may be generated from a standard LTI system, based on a canonical hemodynamic response function, or a more elaborate physiological model such as the Balloon model. This gives us the nonparametric flexibility of the GP, but allows the posterior to fall back on the physiologically based prior when the data are weak. Results on simulated data show that even with an erroneous prior for the GP, the proposed model is still able to discriminate between active and non-active voxels in a satisfactory way. The proposed model is also applied to real fMRI data, where our Gaussian process model in several cases finds brain activity where previously proposed LTI models, parametric and nonparametric, does not.",

    "abstract": "Several decision-making vulnerabilities have been identified as underlying causes for addictive behaviours, or the repeated execution of stereotyped actions despite their adverse consequences. These vulnerabilities are mostly associated with brain alterations caused by the consumption of substances of abuse. However, addiction can also happen in the absence of a pharmacological component, such as seen in pathological gambling and videogaming. We use a new reinforcement learning model to highlight a previously neglected vulnerability that we suggest interacts with those already identified, whilst playing a prominent role in non-pharmacological forms of addiction. Specifically, we show that a duallearning system (i.e. combining model-based and model-free) can be vulnerable to highly rewarding, but suboptimal actions, that are followed by a complex ramification of stochastic adverse effects. This phenomenon is caused by the overload of the capabilities of an agent, as time and cognitive resources required for exploration, deliberation, situation recognition, and habit formation, all increase as a function of the depth and richness of detail of an environment. Furthermore, the cognitive overload can be aggravated due to alterations (e.g. caused by stress) in the bounded rationality, i.e. the limited amount of resources available for the model-based component, in turn increasing the agents chances to develop or maintain addictive behaviours. Our study demonstrates that, independent of drug consumption, addictive behaviours can arise in the interaction between the environmental complexity and the biologically finite resources available to explore and represent it.",

Each time the heart beats, blood is expelled and travels through the body. This blood flow can be detected in the face using a standard webcam that is able to pick up subtle changes in color that cannot be seen by the naked eye. Due to the light absorption spectrum of blood, we are able to detect differences in the amount of light absorbed by the blood traveling just below the skin (i.e., photoplethysmography). By modulating emotional and physiological stress--i.e., viewing arousing images and sitting vs. standing, respectively--to elicit changes in heart rate, we explored the feasibility of using a webcam as a psychophysiological measurement of autonomic activity. We found a high level of agreement between established physiological measures, electrocardiogram (ECG), and blood pulse oximetry, and heart rate estimates obtained from the webcam. We thus suggest webcams can be used as a non-invasive and readily available method for measuring psychophysiological changes, easily integrated into existing stimulus presentation software and hardware setups.",

    "abstract": "Engineering robust and tuneable genetic clocks is a topic of current interest in Systems and Synthetic Biology with wide applications in biotechnology. Synthetic genetic oscillators share a common structure based on a negative feedback loop with a time delay, and generally display only limited tuneability. Recently, the dual-feedback oscillator was demonstrated to be robust and tuneable, to some extent, by the use of chemical inducers. Yet no engineered genetic oscillator currently allows for the independent modulation of amplitude and period. In this work, we demonstrate computationally how recent advances in tuneable synthetic degradation can be used to decouple the frequency and amplitude modulation in synthetic genetic oscillators. We show how the range of tuneability can be increased by connecting additional input dials, e.g. orthogonal transcription factors that respond to chemical, temperature or even light signals. Modelling and numerical simulations predict that our proposed re-designs enable amplitude tuning without period modulation, coupled modulation of both period and amplitude, or period adjustment with near-constant amplitude. We illustrate our work through computational re-designs of both the dual-feedback oscillator and the repressilator, and show that the repressilator is more flexible and can allow for independent amplitude and near-independent period modulation.",

K-mer analyses are both useful and fast, but are strongly affected by single-nucleotide polymorphisms or sequencing errors, effectively hindering direct-analyses of whole regions and decreasing their usability between evolutionary distant samples.\\n\\nWe introduce a concept of skip-mers, a cyclic pattern of used-and-skipped positions of k nucleotides spanning a region of size S [&ge;] k, and show how analyses are improved compared to using k-mers. The entropy of skip-mers increases with the larger span, capturing information from more distant positions and increasing the specificity, and uniqueness, of larger span skip-mers within a genome. In addition, skip-mers constructed in cycles of 1 or 2 nucleotides in every 3 (or a multiple of 3) lead to increased sensitivity in the coding regions of genes, by grouping together the more conserved nucleotides of the protein-coding regions.\\n\\nWe implemented a set of tools to count and intersect skip-mers between different datasets. We used these tools to show how skip-mers have advantages over k-mers in terms of entropy and increased sensitivity to detect conserved coding sequence, allowing better identification of genic matches between evolutionarily distant species.

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent analyses of trait-disorder overlap suggest that psychiatric dimensions may relate to distinct sets of genes that exert their maximum influence during different periods of development. This includes analyses of social-communciation difficulties that share, depending on their developmental stage, stronger genetic links with either Autism Spectrum Disorder or schizophrenia. Here we developed a multivariate analysis framework in unrelated individuals to model directly the developmental profile of genetic influences contributing to complex traits, such as social-communication difficulties, during a [~]10-year period spanning childhood and adolescence.\\n\\nMethodsLongitudinally assessed quantitative social-communication problems (N[&le;] 5,551) were studied in participants from a UK birth cohort (ALSPAC, 8 to 17 years). Using standardised measures, genetic architectures were investigated with novel multivariate genetic-relationship-matrix structural equation models (GSEM) incorporating whole-genome genotyping information. Analogous to twin research, GSEM included Cholesky decomposition, common pathway and independent pathway models.\\n\\nResultsA 2-factor Cholesky decomposition model described the data best. One genetic factor was common to SCDC measures across development, the other accounted for independent variation at 11 years and later, consistent with distinct developmental profiles in trait-disorder overlap. Importantly, genetic factors operating at 8 years explained only [~]50% of the genetic variation at 17 years.\\n\\nConclusionUsing latent factor models, we identified developmental changes in the genetic architecture of social-communication difficulties that enhance the understanding of ASD and schizophrenia-related dimensions. More generally, GSEM present a framework for modelling shared genetic aetiologies between phenotypes and can provide prior information with respect to patterns and continuity of trait-disorder overlap.",

    "abstract": "With poliovirus eradication within reach, the WHO has included in its recommendations a cell-culture independent algorithm for enterovirus surveillance. This study was designed to compare both the cell culture dependent and independent algorithms and assess how either might impact our perception of the diversity of enterovirus types present in a sample.\\n\\nSixteen paired samples (16 isolates from RD cell culture and their corresponding stool suspension. i.e. 32 samples) from AFP cases in Nigeria were analyzed in this study. One of these 16 sample pairs (the control) was previously identified and confirmed as poliovirus 2 (PV-2). All the samples were subjected to RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, RT-snPCR (the WHO recommended cell-culture independent algorithm) and its modifications for co-infection detection and resolution. Amplicons were sequenced and strains identified using the enterovirus genotyping tool and phylogenetic analysis.\\n\\nThe enterovirus diversity was shown to be the same between RD cell culture isolates and fecal suspension for the control and five (7, 10, 11, 12 & 14) of the samples analyzed. It was however, different for the remaining 10 (62.5%) samples analyzed. Fourteen different enterovirus types were identified in this study. To be precise, 9 (CV-B4, E6, E7, E13, E14, E19, E29, EV-B75 and EV-B77) and 5 (CV-A1, CV-A11, CV-A13, EV-C99 and PV2) EV-B and EV-C types, respectively where detected in this study. It is crucial to mention that E19 and EV-B75were only recovered from RD cell culture isolates while E14, EV-B77, CV-A11 and CV-A13 were only recovered from fecal suspension.\\n\\nThe results of this study show that both the cell culture dependent and independent protocols recommended by the WHO for enterovirus detection unavoidably bias our perception of the diversity of enterovirus types present in a sample. Hence, rather than jettison one for the other, effort should be directed at harmonizing both for increased sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional mechanisms play a predominant role in the control of microRNA (miRNA) production. Recognition of the terminal loop of precursor miRNAs by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) influences their processing; however, the mechanistic and structural basis for how levels of individual or subsets of miRNAs are regulated is mostly unexplored. We previously described a role for hnRNP A1, an RBP implicated in many aspects of RNA processing, as an auxiliary factor that promotes the Microprocessor-mediated processing of pri-mir-18a. Here, we reveal the mechanistic basis for this stimulatory role of hnRNP A1 by combining integrative structural biology with biochemical and functional assays. We demonstrate that hnRNP A1 forms a 1:1 complex with pri-mir-18a that involves binding of both RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) to cognate RNA sequence motifs in the conserved terminal loop of pri-mir-18a. Terminal loop binding induces an allosteric destabilization of base-pairing in the pri-mir-18a stem that promotes its down-stream processing. Our results highlight terminal loop RNA recognition by RNA-binding proteins as a general principle of miRNA biogenesis and regulation.",

    "abstract": "Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) belongs to the family Birnaviridae and is economically important to the poultry industry worldwide. IBDV infects B cells in the bursa of Fabricius (BF), causing immunosuppression and morbidity in young chickens. In addition to strains that cause classical Gumboro disease, the so-called  very virulent (vv) strain, also in circulation, causes more severe disease and increased mortality. IBDV has traditionally been controlled through the use of live attenuated vaccines, with attenuation resulting from serial passage in non-lymphoid cells. However, the factors that contribute to the vv or attenuated phenotypes are poorly understood. In order to address this, we aimed to investigate host cell-IBDV interactions using a recently described chicken primary B cell model, where chicken B cells are harvested from the BF and cultured ex vivo in the presence of chicken CD40L. We demonstrated that these cells could support the replication of IBDV when infected ex vivo in the laboratory. Furthermore, we evaluated the gene expression profiles of B cells infected with an attenuated strain (D78) and a very virulent strain (UK661) by microarray. We found that key genes involved in B cell activation and signaling (TNFSF13B, CD72 and GRAP) were down-regulated following infection relative to mock, which we speculate could contribute to IBDV-mediated immunosuppression. Moreover, cells responded to infection by expressing antiviral type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes, but the induction was far less pronounced upon infection with UK661, which we speculate could contribute to its virulence.",

To identify possible serological standards to be used in optimization and validation of the pp-NT, we have evaluated the cross-reactivity of hyperimmune chicken reference antisera in this assay.

    "abstract": "Recognition of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) derived from invading pathogens by plant pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) initiates defense responses known as pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Transcription factors (TFs) orchestrate the onset of PTI through complex signaling networks. Here, we characterize the function of ERF19, a member of the Arabidopsis thaliana ethylene response factor (ERF) family. ERF19 was found to act as a negative regulator of PTI against Botrytis cinerea and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst). Notably, overexpression of ERF19 increased plant susceptibility to these pathogens and repressed MAMP-induced PTI outputs. In contrast, expression of the chimeric dominant repressor ERF19-SRDX boosted PTI activation, conferred increased resistance to B. cinerea, and enhanced elf18-triggered immunity against Pst. Consistent with a negative role of ERF19 in PTI, MAMP-mediated growth inhibition was respectively weakened or augmented in lines overexpressing ERF19 or expressing ERF19-SRDX. Moreover, we demonstrate that the transcriptional repressor Novel INteractor of JAZ (NINJA) associates with and represses the function of ERF19. Our work reveals ERF19 as a key player in a buffering mechanism to avoid defects imposed by over-activation of PTI and a potential role for NINJA in fine-tuning ERF19-mediated regulation.",

    "abstract": "Time-lapse imaging using multiple fluorescent reporters is an essential tool to study molecular processes in single cells. However, exposure to even moderate doses of visible excitation light can disturb cellular physiology and alter the quantitative behavior of the cells under study. Here, we set out to develop guidelines to avoid the confounding effects of excitation light in multi-color long-term imaging. We use widefield fluorescence microscopy to measure the effect of the administered excitation light on growth (here called photomorbidity) in yeast. We find that photomorbidity is determined by the cumulative light dose at each wavelength, but independent of the way excitation light is applied. Importantly, photomorbidity possesses a threshold light dose below which no effect is detectable (NOEL, no-observed-effect level). We found, that the suitability of fluorescent proteins for live-cell imaging at the respective excitation light NOEL is equally determined by the cellular autofluorescence and the fluorescent protein brightness. Last, we show that photomorbidity of multiple wavelengths is additive and imaging conditions absent of photomorbidity can be predicted. Our findings enable researchers to find imaging conditions with minimal impact on physiology and can provide a framework for how to approach photomorbidity in other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration responses in animals are widespread across phyla. To identify molecular players that confer regenerative capacities to non-regenerative species is of key relevance for basic research and translational approaches. Here we report a differential response in retinal regeneration between medaka (Oryzias latipes) and zebrafish (Danio rerio). In contrast to zebrafish, medaka Muller glia (olMG) cells behave like progenitors and exhibit a restricted capacity to regenerate the retina. After injury, olMG cells proliferate but fail to self-renew and ultimately only restore photoreceptors.\\n\\nIn our injury paradigm, we observed that in contrast to zebrafish, proliferating olMG cells do not maintain sox2 expression. Sustained sox2 expression in olMG cells confers regenerative responses similar to those of zebrafish MG (drMG) cells. We show that a single, cell-autonomous factor reprograms olMG cells and establishes a regeneration-like mode. Our results position medaka as an attractive model to delineate key regeneration factors with translational potential.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic dependencies between microbial species are common and have a significant impact on the assembly and resilience of microbial communities. However, the origins of such metabolic dependencies, the evolutionary forces that drive metabolic cross-feeding, and the impact of metabolic and genomic architecture on their emergence are not clear. To address these questions, we developed a novel simulation-based framework coupling a model of reductive evolution with a multi-species genome-scale model of microbial metabolism. We used this framework to model the evolution of a two-species microbial community, simulating thousands of independent evolutionary trajectories and investigating the link between genome reductive evolution and the emergence of metabolic interactions. Surprisingly, even though our model does not impose explicit selection for cooperation, metabolic dependencies emerged in nearly half of all evolutionary runs. Evolved dependencies involved cross-feeding of a diverse set of metabolites at varying frequencies, reflecting various constraints imposed by the metabolic network architecture. We additionally found metabolic  missed opportunities, wherein species failed to capitalize on metabolites made available by their partners. When cross-feeding did evolve, it generally emerged immediately after a metabolite became available, but a complete dependence on such cross-fed metabolites often evolved relatively slowly. Examining the genes deleted and retained in each evolutionary trajectory and the timing of gene deletion events along these trajectories, we were further able to identify both genome-wide properties and specific gene retentions that were associated with metabolic phenotypes. Our findings provide insight into the evolution of cooperative metabolic interaction among microbial species, offering a unique view into the way such relationships could emerge in natural settings.",

However, accurately deciphering the DNA sequence from the noisy and complex electrical signal is challenging. Here, we report Chiron, the first deep learning model to achieve end-to-end basecalling: directly translating the raw signal to DNA sequence without the error-prone segmentation step. Trained with only a small set of 4000 reads, we show that our model provides state-of-the-art basecalling accuracy even on previously unseen species. Chiron achieves basecalling speeds of over 2000 bases per second using desktop computer graphics processing units.",
