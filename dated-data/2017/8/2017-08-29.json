    "abstract": "Learning from reward feedback is essential for survival but can become extremely challenging with myriad choice options. Here, we propose that learning reward values of individual features can provide a heuristic for estimating reward values of choice options in dynamic, multidimensional environments. We hypothesized that this feature-based learning occurs not just because it can reduce dimensionality, but more importantly because it can increase adaptability without compromising precision of learning. We experimentally tested this hypothesis and found that in dynamic environments, human subjects adopted feature-based learning even when this approach does not reduce dimensionality. Even in static, low-dimensional environments, subjects initially adopted feature-based learning and gradually switched to learning reward values of individual options, depending on how accurately objects values can be predicted by combining feature values. Our computational models reproduced these results and highlight the importance of neurons coding feature values for parallel learning of values for features and objects.",

    "abstract": "Divergence time estimation -- the calibration of a phylogeny to geological time -- is a integral first step in modelling the tempo of biological evolution (traits and lineages). However, despite increasingly sophisticated methods to infer divergence times from molecular genetic sequences, the estimated age of many nodes across the tree of life contrast significantly and consistently with timeframes conveyed by the fossil record. This is perhaps best exemplified by crown angiosperms, where molecular clock (Triassic) estimates predate the oldest (Early Cretaceous) undisputed angiosperm fossils by tens of millions of years or more. While the incompleteness of the fossil record is a common concern, issues of data limitation and model inadequacy are viable (if underexplored) alternative explanations. In this vein, Beaulieu et al. (2015) convincingly demonstrated how methods of divergence time inference can be misled by both (i) extreme state-dependent molecular substitution rate heterogeneity and (ii) biased sampling of representative major lineages. While these (essentially model-violation) results are robust (and probably common in empirical data sets), we note a further alternative: that the configuration of the statistical inference problem alone (i.e., the parameters, their relationships, and associated priors) precluded the reconstruction of the paleontological timeframe for the crown age of angiosperms. We demonstrate, through sampling from the joint prior (formed by combining the tree (diversification) prior with the various calibration densities specified for fossil-calibrated nodes), that with no data present at all, an Early Cretaceous crown angiosperms is rejected (i.e., has essentially zero probability). More worrisome, however, is that for the 24 nodes calibrated by fossils, almost all have indistinguishable marginal prior and posterior age distributions, indicating an absence of relevant information in the data. Given that these calibrated nodes are strategically placed in disparate regions of the tree, they essentially anchor the tree scaffold, and so the posterior inference for the tree as a whole is largely determined by the pseudo-data present in the (often arbitrary) calibration densities. We recommend, as for any Bayesian analysis, that marginal prior and posterior distributions be carefully compared, especially for parameters of direct interest. Finally, we note that the results presented here do not refute the biological modelling concerns identified by Beaulieu et al. (2015). Both sets of issues remain apposite to the goals of accurate divergence time estimation, and only by considering them in tandem can we move forward more confidently.

    "abstract": "A gradual buildup of electrical potential over motor areas precedes self-initiated movements. Recently, such \\\"readiness potentials\\\" (RPs) were attributed to stochastic fluctuations in neural activity. We developed a new experimental paradigm that operationalised self-initiated actions as endogenous  skip responses while waiting for target stimuli in a perceptual decision task. We compared these to a block of trials where participants could not choose when to skip, but were instead instructed to skip. Frequency and timing of motor action were therefore balanced across blocks, so that conditions differed only in how the timing of skip decisions was generated. We reasoned that across-trial variability of EEG could carry as much information about the source of skip decisions as the mean RP. EEG variability decreased more markedly prior to self-initiated compared to externally-triggered skip actions. This convergence suggests a consistent preparatory process prior to self-initiated action. A leaky stochastic accumulator model could reproduce this convergence given the additional assumption of a systematic decrease in input noise prior to self-initiated actions. Our results may provide a novel neurophysiological perspective on the topical debate regarding whether self-initiated actions arise from a deterministic neurocognitive process, or from neural stochasticity. We suggest that the key precursor of self-initiated action may manifest as a reduction in neural noise.",

    "abstract": "Previous work demonstrated a direct correspondence between the hierarchy of the human visual areas and layers of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) trained on visual object recognition. We used DCNNs to investigate which frequency bands correlate with feature transformations of increasing complexity along the ventral visual pathway. By capitalizing on intracranial depth recordings from 100 patients and 11293 electrodes we assessed the alignment between the DCNN and signals at different frequency bands in different time windows. We found that gamma activity, especially in the low gamma-band (30 - 70 Hz), matched the increasing complexity of visual feature representations in the DCNN. These findings show that the activity of the DCNN captures the essential characteristics of biological object recognition not only in space and time, but also in the frequency domain. These results also demonstrate the potential that modern artificial intelligence algorithms have in advancing our understanding of the brain.\\n\\nSignificance StatementRecent advances in the field of artificial intelligence have revealed principles about neural processing, in particular about vision. Previous works have demonstrated a direct correspondence between the hierarchy of human visual areas and layers of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), suggesting that DCNN is a good model of visual object recognition in primate brain. Studying intracranial depth recordings allowed us to extend previous works by assessing when and at which frequency bands the activity of the visual system corresponds to the DCNN. Our key finding is that signals in gamma frequencies along the ventral visual pathway are aligned with the layers of DCNN. Gamma frequencies play a major role in transforming visual input to coherent object representations.",

We applied multivariate pattern analysis to fMRI data to investigate aspects of familiarity that are shared by all familiar identities and information that distinguishes specific face identities from each other. Both identity-independent familiarity information and face identity could be decoded in an overlapping set of areas in the core and extended systems. Representational similarity analysis revealed a clear distinction between the two systems and a subdivision of the core system into ventral, dorsal and anterior components. This study provides evidence that activity in the extended system carries information about both individual identities and personal familiarity, while clarifying and extending the organization of the core system for face perception.",

    "abstract": "Background & MethodsThe ICONIC project has developed an automated high-throughput pipeline to generate HIV nearly full-length genomes (NFLG, i.e. from gag to nef) from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. The pipeline was applied to 420 HIV samples collected at University College London Hospital and Barts Health NHS Trust (London) and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Cambridge). Consensus genomes were generated and subtyped using COMET, and unique recombinants were studied with jpHMM and SimPlot. Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed using RAxML to identify transmission networks using the Cluster Picker.\\n\\nResultsThe pipeline generated sequences of at least 1Kb of length (median=7.4Kb) for 375 out of the 420 samples (89%), with 174 (46.4%) being NFLG. A total of 365 sequences (169 of them NFLG) corresponded to unique subjects and were included in the down-stream analyses. The most frequent HIV subtypes were B (n=149, 40.8%) and C (n=77, 21.1%) and the circulating recombinant form CRF02_AG (n=32, 8.8%). We found 14 different CRFs (n=66, 18.1%) and multiple URFs (n=32, 8.8%) that involved recombination between 12 different subtypes/CRFs. The most frequent URFs were B/CRF01_AE (4 cases) and A1/D, B/C, and B/CRF02_AG (3 cases each). Most URFs (19/26, 73%) lacked breakpoints in the PR+RT pol region, rendering them undetectable if only that was sequenced. Twelve (37.5%) of the URFs could have emerged within the UK, whereas the rest were probably imported from sub-Saharan Africa, South East Asia and South America. For 2 URFs we found highly similar pol sequences circulating in the UK. We detected 31 phylogenetic clusters using the full dataset: 25 pairs (mostly subtypes B and C), 4 triplets and 2 quadruplets. Some of these were not consistent across different genes due to inter- and intra-subtype recombination. Clusters involved 70 sequences, 19.2% of the dataset.\\n\\nConclusionsThe initial analysis of genome sequences detected substantial hidden variability in the London HIV epidemic. Analysing full genome sequences, as opposed to only PR+RT, identified previously undetected recombinants. It provided a more reliable description of CRFs (that would be otherwise misclassified) and transmission clusters.",

    "abstract": "During non-REM sleep, memory consolidation is driven by a dialogue between hippocampus and cortex involving the reactivation of specific neural activity sequences ( replay). In the hippocampus, replay occurs during sharp-wave ripples (SWRs), short bouts of excitatory activity in area CA3 which induce high frequency oscillations in the inhibitory interneurons of area CA1. Despite growing evidence for the functional importance of replay, its neural mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a novel theoretical model of hippocampal spiking during SWRs. In our model, noise-induced activation of CA3 pyramidal cells triggered an excitatory cascade capable of inducing local ripple events in CA1. Ripples occurred stochastically, with Schaffer Collaterals driving their coordination, so that localized sharp waves in CA3 produced consistently localized CA1 ripples. In agreement with experimental data, the majority of pyramidal cells in the model showed low reactivation probabilities across SWRs. We found, however, that a subpopulation of pyramidal cells had high reactivation probabilities, which derived from fine-tuning of the network connectivity. In particular, the excitatory inputs along synaptic pathway(s) converging onto cells and cell pairs controlled emergent single cell and cell pair reactivation, with inhibitory inputs and intrinsic cell excitability playing differential roles in CA3 vs. CA1. Our model predicts (1) that the hippocampal network structure driving the emergence of SWR is also able to generate and modulate reactivation, (2) inhibition plays a particularly prominent role in CA3 reactivation and (3) CA1 sequence reactivation is reliant on CA3-CA1 interactions rather than an intrinsic CA1 process.",

In the Drosophila olfactory system, the lateral horn (LH) and the mushroom body (MB) are thought to mediate innate and learned olfactory behavior respectively, although the function of the LH has not been directly tested. Here we identify two LH cell-types (PD2a1/b1) that receive input from an MB output neuron required for recall of aversive olfactory memories. In contrast to the model above we find that PD2a1/b1 are required for aversive memory retrieval. PD2a1/b1 activity is modulated by training, indicating that memory information is passed to the innate olfactory processing centre. We map the connectivity of PD2a1/b1 to other olfactory neurons with connectomic data. This provides a circuit mechanism by which learned and unlearned olfactory information can interact to produce appropriate behavior.",

    "abstract": "Although complex interactions between hosts and microbial associates are increasingly well documented, we still know little about how and why hosts shape microbial communities in nature. In addition, host genetic effects on microbial communities vary widely depending on the environment, obscuring conclusions about which microbes are impacted and which plant functions are important. We characterized the leaf microbiota of 200 A. thaliana genotypes in eight field experiments and detected consistent host effects on specific, broadly distributed microbial OTUs. Host genetics disproportionately influenced hubs within the microbial communities, with their impact then percolating through the community, as evidenced by a decline in the heritability of particular OTUs with their distance to the nearest hub. By simultaneously measuring host performance, we found that host genetics associated with microbial hubs explained over 10% of the variation in lifetime seed production among host genotypes across sites and years. We successfully cultured one of these microbial hubs and demonstrated its growth-promoting effects on plants grown in sterile conditions. Finally, genome-wide association mapping identified many putatively causal genes with small effects on the relative abundance of microbial hubs across sites and years, and these genes were enriched for those involved in the synthesis of specialized metabolites, auxins and the immune system. Using untargeted metabolomics, we corroborate the consistent association of variation in specialized metabolites and microbial hubs across field sites. Together, our results reveal that host natural variation impacts the microbial communities in consistent ways across environments and that these effects contribute to fitness variation among host genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Scientific studies report crucial impacts of biomechanical effectors to modulate wound healing either by scarring or regeneration. Further, the biological decision to predominantly favor the former is still cryptic. Real-time visualization of biomechanical manifestations in situ in scarring is hence necessary. Endorsed by nanostructural testing, synthetic phantom analysis, and computational simulations, we found strong mechanobiological correlates for Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT) speckles in mice cutaneous repair (full-thickness) up to 10 months. The theoretical basis of the optomechanics to provide insights into scar form-factor and evolution is proposed. Optomechanical changes have been considered as the resultant of intrinsic (e.g. fiber elastic modulus) and gross tissue mechanics (extracellular matrix (ECM)) in maturing scars. Non-invasive optomechanics supported with microscopic findings reveal scars cross-sectional self-organizing di-fork architecture. Dual-compartment heterogeneity of di-fork exhibits stress-evading features with a dichotomy in inhabitant cellular stress-fiber distributions. This differential interactivity of scar with adjoining tissues reflects its architectural intelligence to compensate tissue loss (hypodermis/muscle) by assembling into a di-fork. Gradual establishment of baseline shifted lasting mechanobiological steady-state, later in scarring, expose scar as an alternate stable state within the skin.\n\nSignificance StatementWound repair in mammals, predominantly culminates into function compromising scar that is occasionally fatal in vital organs. How the biological system often adopts scarring over a restorative regeneration is yet a conundrum. Wound and ambient mechanics play a pivotal role in deciding the healing fate. SS-OCT is hence demonstrated here as a non-invasive window to such mechanical manifestations during skin wound healing. This exposed gradual emergence of temporally maintained and stress-resilient di-fork architecture of the scar with differential neighborhood interfaces. Accommodation of such an alternate self-organizing steady-state of scar sheds light on its sustenance and paradoxical selection.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent staining is a common tool for both quantitative and qualitative assessment of pro- and eukaryotic cells sub-population fractions by using microscopy and flow cytometry. However, direct cell counting by flow cytometry is often limited, for example when working with cells rigidly adhered either to each other or to external surfaces like bacterial biofilms or adherent cell lines and tissue samples. An alternative approach is provided by using fluorescent microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), which enables the evaluation of fractions of cells subpopulations in a given sample. For the quantitative assessment of cell fractions in microphotographs, we suggest a simple two-step algorithm that combines single cells selection and the statistical analysis. To facilitate the first step, we suggest a simple procedure that supports finding the balance between the detection threshold and the typical size of single cells based on objective cell size distribution analysis. Based on a series of experimental measurements performed on bacterial and eukaryotic cells under various conditions, we show explicitly that the suggested approach effectively accounts for the fractions of different cell sub-populations (like the live/dead staining in our samples) in all studied cases that are in good agreement with manual cell counting on microphotographs and flow cytometry data. This algorithm is implemented as a simple software tool that includes an intuitive and user-friendly graphical interface for the initial adjustment of algorithm parameters to the microphotographs analysis as well as for the sequential analysis of homogeneous series of similar microscopic images without further user intervention.

    "abstract": "The inflammatory response, modulated both by tissue resident macrophages and recruited monocytes from peripheral blood, plays a critical role in human diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we sought a model to interrogate human immune behavior in vivo. We determined that primary human monocytes and macrophages survive in zebrafish for up to two weeks. Flow cytometry revealed that human monocytes cultured at the physiological temperature of the zebrafish survive and differentiate comparable to cohorts cultured at human physiological temperature. Moreover, key genes that encode for proteins that play a role in tissue remodeling were also expressed. Human cells migrated within multiple tissues at speeds comparable to zebrafish macrophages. Analysis of gene expression of in vivo educated human macrophages confirmed expression of activated macrophage phenotypes. Here, human cells adopted phenotypes relevant to cancer progression, suggesting that we can define the real time immune modulation of human tumor cells during the establishment of a metastatic lesion in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Here we report a novel microdroplet PCR method combined with fluorescence spectrophotometry (MPFS), which allows for qualitative, quantitative and high -throughput detection of multiple DNA targets. In this study, each pair of primers was labeled with a specific fluorophore. Through microdroplet PCR, a target DNA was amplified and labeled with the same fluorophore. After products purification, the DNA products tagged with different fluorophores could be analyzed qualitatively by the fluorescent intensity determination. The relative fluorensence unit was also measured to construct the standard curve and to achieve quantitative analysis. In a reaction, the co -amplified products with different fluorophores could be simultaneously analyzed to achieve high -throughput detection. We used four kinds of GM maize as a model to confirm this theory. The qualitative results revealed high specificity and sensitivity of 0.5% (w / w). The quantitative results revealed that the limit of detection was 103copies and with good repeatability. Moreover, reproducibility assay were further performed using four foodborne pathogenic bacteria. Consequently, the same qualitative, quantitative and high-throughput results were confirmed as the four GM maize.",

Here, we report the first, 2GB genome of a cockroach, Blattella germanica, and the 1.3GB genome of the drywood termite, Cryptotermes secundus. We show evolutionary signatures of termite eusociality by comparing the genomes and transcriptomes of three termites and the cockroach against the background of 16 other eusocial and non-eusocial insects. Dramatic adaptive changes in genes underlying the production and perception of pheromones confirm the importance of chemical communication in the termites. These are accompanied by major changes in gene regulation and the molecular evolution of caste determination. Many of these results parallel molecular mechanisms of eusocial evolution in Hymenoptera. However, the specific solutions are remarkably different, thus revealing a striking case of convergence in one of the major evolutionary transitions in biological complexity.",

    "abstract": "Inborn errors of purine metabolism are rare syndromes with an array of complex phenotypes in humans. One such disorder, adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASLD), is caused by a decrease in the activity of the bi-functional purine biosynthetic enzyme, adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL). Mutations in human ADSL cause epilepsy, muscle ataxia, and autistic-like symptoms. Although the genetic basis of ASLD syndrome is known, the molecular mechanisms driving phenotypic outcome are not. Here, we characterize neuromuscular and reproductive phenotypes associated with a deficiency of adsl-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans. Characterization of the neuromuscular phenotype reveals a disruption of cholinergic transmission affecting muscular contraction. Using genetics, pharmacological supplementation, and metabolite measurements, we correlate phenotypes with distinct metabolic perturbations. The neuromuscular defect is associated with a toxic accumulation of a purine biosynthetic intermediate whereas the reproductive defect can be ameliorated by purine supplementation, indicating differing molecular mechanisms behind the phenotypes of ASLD. Because purine metabolism is highly conserved in metazoans, we suggest that similar separable metabolic perturbations result in the varied symptoms in the human disorder and that a dual-approach therapeutic strategy may be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial sirtuins regulate biochemical pathways and are emerging drug targets for metabolic and age-related diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration. Yet, their functions remain unclear. Here, we uncover a novel physiological role for the C. elegans mitochondrial sirtuins, sir-2.2 and sir-2.3, in lifespan regulation. Using a genetic approach, we demonstrate that sir-2.2 and sir-2.3 mutants live 28-30% longer than controls when fed the normal lab diet of E. coli OP50. Interestingly, this effect is diet specific and is not observed when animals are fed the strain HT115, which is typically used for RNAi experiments. While decreased consumption of food is a known mechanism for lifespan extension, this does not account for the increased lifespan in the mitochondrial sirtuin mutants. sir-2.2 and sir-2.3 mutants display altered expression of genes involved in oxidative stress response, including increased expression of the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase sod-3 and decreased levels of catalases ctl-1 and ctl-2. Like their extended lifespan phenotype, these alterations in oxidative stress gene expression are diet dependent. The mitochondrial sirtuin mutants are more resistant to the lifespan extending effects of low levels of superoxide, suggesting that their increased lifespan involves a hormetic response. Our data suggest that sir-2.2 and sir-2.3 are not completely redundant in function and may possess overlapping yet distinct mechanisms for regulating oxidative stress response and lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Thawing submarine permafrost is a source of methane to the subsurface biosphere. Methane oxidation in submarine permafrost sediments has been proposed, but the responsible microorganisms remain uncharacterized. We analyzed archaeal communities and identified distinct anaerobic methanotrophic (ANME-2a/b, ANME-2d) assemblages in frozen and completely thawed submarine permafrost sediments. Besides archaea potentially involved in AOM we found a large diversity of archaea mainly belonging to Bathyarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota. Methane concentrations and {delta}13C-methane signatures distinguish horizons of potential anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled either to sulfate reduction in a sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) or to the reduction of other electron acceptors, such as iron, manganese or nitrate. Analysis of functional marker genes (mcrA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) corroborate AOM communities in submarine permafrost sediments potentially active at low temperatures. Extrapolating potential AOM rates, when scaled to the total area of expected submarine permafrost thaw, reveals that methane could be consumed at rates between 8 and 120 Tg C per year, which is comparable to other AOM habitats such as seeps, continental SMTZ and wetlands. We thus propose that AOM is active where submarine permafrost thaws and needs to be accounted for in global methane budgets.",

Whole genome sequencing was used to characterise antibiotic resistance genes, sequence types (STs), plasmids and phylogenetic relationships. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined using disk diffusion and Etest.\\n\\nResultsA total of 70 E. coli were included, of which the majority were ST131 (61.4%). BSI was most frequently from a urinary source (69.6%), community-associated (62.9%) and in older patients (median age 71 years [IQR 64-81]). The median Pitt bacteraemia score at presentation was 1 (IQR 0-2, range 0-3) and ICU admission was infrequent (3.1%). ST131 possessed significantly more acquired resistance genes than non-ST131 (p=0.003). Clade C1/C2 ST131 predominated (30.2% and 53.5% of all ST131 respectively) and these were all resistant to ciprofloxacin. All clade A ST131 were community-associated. The predominant ESBL types were blaCTX-M (78.6% of isolates) and were strongly associated with ST131, with the majority blaCTX-M-15. Clade C1 was associated with blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M-27, whereas blaCTX-M-15 predominated in clade C2. Plasmid-mediated AmpC (p-AmpC) genes (mainly blaCMY-2) were also frequent (17.1%) but were more common with non-ST131 strains (p< 0.001).

    "abstract": "Verticillium dahliae infection of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa) is a major cause of disease-induced wilting in soil-grown strawberries across the world. To understand what components of the pathogen are affecting disease expression, the presence of the known effector VdAve1 was screened in a sample of Verticillium dahliae isolates. Isolates from strawberry were found to contain VdAve1 and were divided into two major clades, based upon their vegetative compatibility groups (VCG); no UK strawberry isolates contained VdAve1. VC clade was strongly related to their virulence levels. VdAve1-containing isolates pathogenic on strawberry were found in both clades, in contrast to some recently published findings.\\n\\nOn strawberry, VdAve1-containing isolates had significantly higher virulence during early infection, which diminished in significance as the infection progressed. Transformation of a virulent non-VdAve1 containing isolate, with VdAve1 was found neither to increase nor decrease virulence when inoculated on a susceptible strawberry cultivar. There are therefore virulence factors that are epistatic to VdAve1 and potentially multiple independent routes to high virulence on strawberry in V. dahliae lineages.\\n\\nGenome sequencing a subset of isolates across the two VCGs revealed that isolates were differentiated at the whole genome level and contained multiple changes in putative effector content, indicating that different clonal VCGs may have evolved different strategies for infecting strawberry, leading to different virulence levels in pathogenicity tests. It is therefore important to consider both clonal lineage and effector complement as the adaptive potential of each lineage will differ, even if they contain the same race determining effector.",

    "abstract": "A common approach to simulating chemical reaction systems is to formulate the problem as a set of ordinary differential equation and solve them using standard numerical procedures. Such a formulation works well when the number of molecules involved in the simulation is large and assumes a deterministic formulation for the underling chemical kinetics. However for systems such as gene regulatory networks where the number of molecules of a specific species can be of the order of 10s of molecules, the deterministic approach fails to capture important dynamical features. At low molecular numbers stochastic events dominate the dynamics. As a result much research has been devoted to developing numerical algorithms for computing the stochastic trajectories. One of the most common approaches is based on Gillespies stochastic simulation algorithm, for example the direct method. Due to its simplicity the direct method has been implemented many times in software. However, unusually, there does not appear to be a C based reusable software library.

    "abstract": "Plants respond to seasonal cues, such as the photoperiod, to adapt to current conditions and to prepare for environmental changes in the season to come. To assess photoperiodic responses at the protein level, we quantified the proteome of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana by mass spectrometry across four photoperiods. This revealed coordinated changes of abundance in proteins of photosynthesis, primary and secondary metabolism, including pigment biosynthesis, consistent with higher metabolic activity in long photoperiods. Higher translation rates in the daytime than the night likely contribute to these changes via rhythmic changes in RNA abundance. Photoperiodic control of protein levels might be greatest only if high translation rates coincide with high transcript levels in some photoperiods. We term this proposed mechanism {acute}translational coincidence{acute}, mathematically model its components, and demonstrate its effect on the Arabidopsis proteome. Datasets from a green alga and a cyanobacterium suggest that translational coincidence contributes to seasonal control of the proteome in many phototrophic organisms. This may explain why many transcripts but not their cognate proteins exhibit diurnal rhythms.",

However, our understanding of the gut receptors involved in Bt toxin binding, and which receptors confer resistance to these toxins is incomplete, especially in diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), a major agricultural pest. Identifying receptors has remained challenging because we lack sufficiently sensitive methods to detect Bt receptor interactions. Here, we report a modified far-immunoblotting technique, which revealed a broad spectrum of binding targets for the Bt toxins Cry1Ac, Cry1Ab, and Cry1Bd in diamondback moth. We confirm the role of the glucosinolate sulfatases GSS1 and GSS2 in Cry1Bd toxicity. GSS1 and GSS2 bind directly to Cry1Bd, and their expression is crucial for Cry1Bd toxicity. These results improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of Bt toxicity.\\n\\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe Bt toxins, from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, have wide applications in agriculture as insecticides applied to plants or expressed in genetically modified crops. Bt toxins bind to receptors in the brush border membrane of the insect gut and create pores leading to insect death. The success of the Bt toxins in controlling insect pests has been hindered by the emergence of resistant insects, which show reduced binding of Bt to their gut membranes. Although ongoing research has identified a few receptors, many remain unknown and the mechanisms by which these receptors cause resistance remain unclear. Here, we used a modified far-immunoblotting technique to identify proteins that bind to the toxins Cry1Ac, Cry1Ab, and Cry1Bd in the diamondback moth. This identified two glucosinolate sulfatases that bind directly to Cry1Bd; also, the toxicity of Cry1Bd requires expression of these glucosinolate sulfatases. Therefore, identification of these candidate receptors improves our understanding of Bt function and resistance.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, two-pore channels (TPC1-3) comprise a family of ion channels that regulate the conductance of Na+ and Ca2+ ions across cellular membranes. TPC1-3 form endolysosomal channels, but TPC3 can also function in the plasma membrane. TPC1/3 are voltage-gated channels, but TPC2 opens in response to binding endolysosome-specific lipid phosphatidylinositol-3,5-diphosphate (PI(3,5)P2). Filoviruses, such as Ebola, exploit TPC-mediated ion release as a means of escape from the endolysosome during infection. Antagonists that block TPC1/2 channel conductance abrogate filoviral infections. TPC1/2 form complexes with the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) at the endolysosomal surface that couple cellular metabolic state and cytosolic nutrient concentrations to the control of membrane potential and pH. We determined the X-ray structure of TPC1 from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtTPC1) to 2.87[A] resolution-one of the two first reports of a TPC channel structure. Here we summarize these findings and the implications that the structure may have for understanding endolysosomal control mechanisms and their role in human health.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

Many confounding factors contribute the difficulties including complexity of variant, sequencing and alignment error, tumor clonality and sample purity etc. Current genomic variant callers are too time-consuming to meet the requirement of clinical application in precision medicine. We developed superfast and universal Genomic Variant Caller (GVC), which can simultaneously detect various genomic variants including SNV, sINDEL and SV from personal and normal-cancer paired whole-genome/exome sequencing data within fifteen minutes. Whats more, it achieved higher sensitivity and precision than popular variant callers including GATK4, Mutect, NovoBreak in germline and somatic variant detection from NA12878 and ICGC-TCGA Dream Challenge Datasets respectuvely. It is worth mentioning that GVC achieved comparable performance in variant detection from NA12878 sequenced by three different high-throughput sequencing platforms including Illumina HiSeq2000, NovaSeq and BGISEQ-500.",

    "abstract": "In a quest for finding additional structural constraints, apart from disordered segments, regulating protein half-life in the cell (and during evolution), here we recognize and assess the influence of native topology of biological proteins and their sequestration into multimeric complexes. Native topology acts as a molecular marker of proteins mechanical resistance and consequently captures their half-life variations on genome-scale, irrespective of the enormous sequence, structural and functional diversity of the proteins. Cooperative stability (slower degradation upon sequestration into complexes) is a master regulator of oligomeric protein half-life that involves at least three mechanisms. (i) Association with multiple complexes results longer protein half-life; (ii) hierarchy of complex self-assembly involves short-living proteins binding late in the assembly order and (iii) binding with larger buried surface area leads to slower subunit dissociation and thereby longer half-life. Altered half-lives of paralog proteins refer to their structural divergence and oligomerization with non-identical set of complexes.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical properties of biological tissues are increasingly recognized as important factors in developmental and pathological processes. Most existing mechanical measurement techniques either necessitate destruction of the tissue for access or provide insufficient spatial resolution. Here, we show for the first time a systematic application of confocal Brillouin microscopy to quantitatively map the mechanical properties of spinal cord tissues during biologically relevant processes in a contact-free and non-destructive manner. Living zebrafish larvae were mechanically imaged in all anatomical planes, during development and after spinal cord injury. These experiments revealed that Brillouin microscopy is capable of detecting the mechanical properties of distinct anatomical structures without interfering with the animals natural development. The Brillouin shift within the spinal cord increased during development and transiently decreased during the repair processes following spinal cord transection. By taking into account the refractive index distribution, we explicitly determined the apparent longitudinal modulus and viscosity of different larval zebrafish tissues. Importantly, mechanical properties differed between tissues in situ and in excised slices. The presented work constitutes the first step towards an in vivo assessment of spinal cord tissue mechanics during regeneration, provides a methodical basis to identify key determinants of mechanical tissue properties and allows to test their relative importance in combination with biochemical and genetic factors during developmental and regenerative processes.",

In a public goods game, cheaters do not pay for the cost of the public goods, yet they receive the benefit. Although this free-riding harms the entire population in the long run, the success of cheaters may aid the population when there is a common enemy that antagonizes both cooperators and cheaters. Here we study models in which an immune system antagonizes a cooperating pathogen. We investigate three population dynamics models, and determine under what conditions the presence of cheaters help defeat the immune system. The mechanism of action is that a polymorphism of cheaters and altruists optimizes the average growth rate. Our results give support for a possible synergy between cooperators and cheaters in ecological public goods games.",

We used high-throughput sequencing in families with multiple cases of IBD, followed by genotyping of cases and controls, to investigate whether rare protein altering genetic variants are associated with susceptibility to IBD.\\n\\nMethodsWhole exome sequencing was carried out in 10 families in which 3 or more individuals were affected with IBD.

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy is prevalent in human preimplantation embryos and is the leading cause of pregnancy loss. Many aneuploidies arise during oogenesis, increasing in frequency with maternal age. Superimposed on these meiotic aneuploidies are a range of errors occurring during early mitotic divisions of the embryo, contributing to widespread chromosomal mosaicism. Here we reanalyzed a published dataset comprising preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy in 24,653 blastomere biopsies from day-3 cleavage-stage embryos, as well as 17,051 trophectoderm biopsies from day-5 blastocysts. We focused on complex abnormalities that affected multiple chromosomes simultaneously, seeking to quantify their incidences and gain insight into their mechanisms of formation. In addition to well-described patterns such as triploidy and haploidy, we identified 4.7% of day-3 blastomeres possessing karyotypes suggestive of tripolar mitosis in normally-fertilized diploid zygotes or descendant diploid cells. We further supported this hypothesis using time-lapse data from an intersecting set of 77 cleavage-stage embryos. The diploid tripolar signature was rare among day-5 blastocyst biopsies (0.5%), suggesting that complex aneuploidy generated by tripolar mitosis impairs cellular and/or early embryonic survival. Strikingly, we found that the tripolar mitosis mechanism is responsible for the previously described association with common maternal genetic variants spanning PLK4. Our findings are consistent with the role of PLK4 as the master regulator of centriole duplication with a known capacity to induce tripolar mitosis when mutated or mis-expressed. Taken together, we propose that tripolar mitosis is a key mechanism generating karyotype-wide aneuploidy in cleavage-stage embryos and implicate PLK4-mediated centrosome abnormality as a factor influencing its occurrence.",

Disability was assessed with the Expanded-Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We obtained volumes of the deep GM (DGM), temporal, frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar GM, brainstem and cerebral white matter. Hierarchical mixed-models assessed annual percentage rate of regional tissue loss and identified regional volumes associated with time-to-EDSS progression.\\n\\nResultsSPMS showed the lowest baseline volumes of cortical GM and DGM. Of all baseline regional volumes, only that of the DGM predicted time-to-EDSS progression (hazard ratio=0.73, 95% CIs 0.65, 0.82; p<0.001): for every standard deviation decrease in baseline DGM volume, the risk of presenting a shorter time to EDSS worsening during follow-up increased by 27%. Of all longitudinal measures, DGM showed the fastest annual rate of atrophy, which was faster in SPMS (-1.45%), PPMS (-1.66%), and RRMS (-1.34%) than CIS (-0.88%) and HCs (-0.94%)[p<0.01]. The rate of temporal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.21%) was significantly faster than RRMS (-0.76%), CIS (-0.75%), and HCs (-0.51%). Similarly, the rate of parietal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.24-%) was faster than CIS (-0.63%) and HCs (-0.23%) (all p values <0.05). Only the atrophy rate in DGM in patients was significantly associated with disability accumulation (beta=0.04, p<0.001).\\n\\nInterpretationThis large multi-centre and longitudinal study shows that DGM volume loss drives disability accumulation in MS, and that temporal cortical GM shows accelerated atrophy in SPMS than RRMS. The difference in regional GM atrophy development between phenotypes needs to be taken into account when evaluating treatment effect of therapeutic interventions.",

    "abstract": "Many models of cognition and of neural computations posit the use and estimation of prior stimulus statistics1-4: it has long been known that working memory and perception are strongly impacted by previous sensory experience, even when that sensory history is irrelevant for the current task at hand. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms and brain regions necessary for computing and using such priors are unknown. Here we report that the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a critical locus for the representation and use of prior stimulus information. We trained rats in an auditory Parametric Working Memory (PWM) task, and found that rats displayed substantial and readily quantifiable behavioral effects of sensory stimulus history, similar to those observed in humans5,6 and monkeys7. Earlier proposals that PPC supports working memory8,9 predict that optogenetic silencing of this region would impair behavior in our working memory task. Contrary to this prediction, silencing PPC significantly improved performance. Quantitative analyses of behavior revealed that this improvement was due to the selective reduction of the effects of prior sensory stimuli. Electrophysiological recordings showed that PPC neurons carried far more information about sensory stimuli of previous trials than about stimuli of the current trial. Furthermore, the more information about previous trial sensory history in the neural firing rates of a given rats PPC, the greater the behavioral effect of sensory history in that rat, suggesting a tight link between behavior and PPC representations of stimulus history. Our results indicate that the PPC is a central component in the processing of sensory stimulus history, and open a window for neurobiological investigation of long-standing questions regarding how perception and working memory are affected by prior sensory information.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases likely share common underlying pathobiology. Although prior work has identified susceptibility loci associated with various dementias, few, if any, studies have systematically evaluated shared genetic risk across several neurodegenerative diseases. Using genome-wide association data from large studies (total n = 82,337 cases and controls), we utilized a previously validated approach to identify genetic overlap and reveal common pathways between progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Parkinsons disease (PD) and Alzheimers disease (AD). In addition to the MAPT H1 haplotype, we identified a variant near the chemokine receptor CXCR4 that was jointly associated with increased risk for PSP and PD. Using bioinformatics tools, we found strong physical interactions between CXCR4 and four microglia related genes, namely CXCL12, TLR2, RALB and CCR5. Evaluating gene expression from post-mortem brain tissue, we found that expression of CXCR4 and microglial genes functionally related to CXCR4 was dysregulated across a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, in a mouse model of tauopathy, expression of CXCR4 and functionally associated genes was significantly altered in regions of the mouse brain that accumulate neurofibrillary tangles most robustly. Beyond MAPT, we show dysregulation of CXCR4 expression in PSP, PD, and FTD brains, and mouse models of tau pathology. Our multi-modal findings suggest that abnormal signaling across a  network of microglial genes may contribute to neurodegeneration and may have potential implications for clinical trials targeting immune dysfunction in patients with neurodegenerative diseases.",

Unfortunately, the limited resolution of microbial taxonomy hinders the exploration of this hypothesis and specifically challenges the discovery of gut microbes that are linked to mammalian evolution. To address this, we developed a novel approach that groups microbes into new, more meaningful taxonomic units based on their common ancestry and ecological redundancy. Treating mammalian lineages as different ecosystems, we quantified the distribution of these microbial taxa across mammals. Our analysis discovered monophyletic clades of gut bacteria that are unexpectedly prevalent, or conserved, across all mammals, as well as conserved clades that are exclusive to particular mammalian lineages. These clades often manifest phylogenetic patterns indicating that they are subject to selection. Lineage - specific changes in clade conservation, including a human-accelerated loss of conserved clades, suggest that mammalian evolution associates with a change in the selective regimes that act on gut microbiota. Collectively, these results point to the existence of microbes that possess traits that facilitate their dispersion or survival in the mammalian gut, possibly because they are subject to host selection. Ultimately, our analysis clarifies the relationship between the diversification of the gut microbiome and mammalian evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTCoronaviruses (CoV) are positive-sense RNA viruses that infect numerous mammalian and avian species and are capable of causing severe and lethal disease in humans. CoVs encode several innate immune antagonists that interact with the host innate immune response to facilitate efficient viral replication. CoV non-structural protein 14 (nsp14) encodes 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease activity (ExoN), which performs a proofreading function and is required for high-fidelity replication. Outside of the order Nidovirales, arenaviruses are the only RNA viruses that encode an ExoN, which functions to degrade dsRNA replication intermediates. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CoV ExoN may also function to antagonize the innate immune response. We demonstrate that viruses lacking ExoN activity [ExoN(-)] are sensitive to cellular pretreatment with interferon beta (IFN-{beta}) in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, ExoN(-) virus replication was attenuated in wild-type bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and partially restored in interferon alpha/beta receptor deficient (IFNAR-/-) BMMs. ExoN(-) virus replication did not result in IFN-{beta} gene expression, and in the presence of an IFN-{beta}-mediated antiviral state, ExoN(-) viral RNA levels were not substantially reduced relative to untreated. However, ExoN(-) virus generated from IFN-{beta} pretreated cells had reduced specific infectivity and decreased relative fitness, suggesting that ExoN(-) virus generated during an antiviral state is less viable to establish a subsequent infection. Overall, our data suggest MHV ExoN activity is required for resistance to the innate immune response and antiviral mechanisms affecting the viral RNA sequence and/or an RNA modification act on viruses lacking ExoN activity.",

    "abstract": "Semantic cognition refers to the appropriate use of acquired knowledge about the world. This requires representation of knowledge as well as control processes which ensure that currently-relevant aspects of knowledge are retrieved and selected. Although these abilities can be impaired selectively following brain damage, the relationship between them in healthy individuals is unclear. It is also commonly assumed that semantic cognition is preserved in later life, because older people have greater reserves of knowledge. However, this claim overlooks the possibility of decline in semantic control processes. Here, semantic cognition was assessed in 100 young and older adults. Despite having a broader knowledge base, older people showed specific impairments in semantic control, performing more poorly than young people when selecting among competing semantic representations. Conversely, they showed preserved controlled retrieval of less salient information from the semantic store. Breadth of semantic knowledge was positively correlated with controlled retrieval but was unrelated to semantic selection ability, which was instead correlated with non-semantic executive function. These findings indicate that three distinct elements contribute to semantic cognition: semantic representations that accumulate throughout the lifespan, processes for controlled retrieval of less salient semantic information, which appear age-invariant, and mechanisms for selecting task-relevant aspects of semantic knowledge, which decline with age and may relate more closely to domain-general executive control.",

High-throughput chromosome conformation capture experiments such as Hi-C are used to obtain genome-wide maps of 3D chromatin contacts. However, robust estimation of data quality and systematic comparison of these contact maps is challenging due to the multi-scale, hierarchical structure of chromatin contacts and the resulting properties of experimental noise in the data. Measuring concordance of contact maps is important for assessing reproducibility of replicate experiments and for modeling variation between different cellular contexts.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce a concordance measure called GenomeDISCO (DIfferences between Smoothed COntact maps) for assessing the similarity of a pair of contact maps obtained from chromosome conformation capture experiments. The key idea is to smooth contact maps using random walks on the contact map graph, before estimating concordance. We use simulated datasets to benchmark GenomeDISCOs sensitivity to different types of noise that affect chromatin contact maps. When applied to a large collection of Hi-C datasets, GenomeDISCO accurately distinguishes biological replicates from samples obtained from different cell types. GenomeDISCO also generalizes to other chromosome conformation capture assays, such as HiChIP.\\n\\nAvailabilitySoftware implementing GenomeDISCO is available at https://github.com/kundajelab/genomedisco.\\n\\nContactakundaje@stanford.edu\\n\\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "When performing bioforensic casework, it is important to be able to reliably detect the presence of a particular organism in a metagenomic sample, even if the organism is only present in a trace amount. For this task, it is common to use a sequence classification program that determines the taxonomic affiliation of individual sequence reads by comparing them to reference database sequences. As metagenomic data sets often consist of millions or billions of reads that need to be compared to reference databases containing millions of sequences, such sequence classification programs typically use search heuristics and databases with reduced sequence diversity to speed up the analysis, which can lead to incorrect assignments. Thus, in a bioforensic setting where correct assignments are paramount, assignments of interest made by \\\"first-pass\\\" classifiers should be confirmed using the most precise methods and comprehensive databases available. In this study we present a O_SCPLOWBLASTC_SCPLOW-based method for validating the assignments made by less precise sequence classification programs, with optimal parameters for filtering of O_SCPLOWBLASTC_SCPLOW results determined via simulation of sequence reads from genomes of interest, and we apply the method to the detection of four pathogenic organisms.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing neuronal morphology across different regions or even the whole brain is important in many areas of neuroscience research. Large-scale tracing of neurites constitutes the core of this type of reconstruction and has many challenges. One key challenge is how to identify a weak signal from an inhomogeneous background. Here, we addressed this problem by constructing an identification model. In this model, empirical observations made from neuronal images are summarized into rules, which are used to design feature vectors that display the differences between the foreground and background, and a support vector machine is used to learn these feature vectors. We embedded this identification model into a tool that we previously developed, SparseTracer, and termed this integration SparseTracer-Learned Feature Vector (ST-LFV). ST-LFV can trace neurites with extremely weak signals (signal-to-background-noise ratio <1.1) against an inhomogeneous background. By testing 12 sub-blocks extracted from a whole imaging dataset, ST-LFV can achieve an average recall rate of 0.99 and precision rate of 0.97, which is superior to that of SparseTracer (which has an average recall rate of 0.93 and average precision rate of 0.86), indicating that this method is well suited to weak signal identification. We applied ST-LFV to trace neurites from large-scale images (approximately 105 GB). During the tracing process, obtaining results equivalent to the ground truth required only one round of manual editing for ST-LFV compared to 20 rounds of manual editing for SparseTracer. This improvement in the level of automatic reconstruction indicates that ST-LFV has the potential to rapidly reconstruct sparsely distributed neurons at the scale of an entire brain.",

    "abstract": "Medium to large phylogenetic gene trees constructed from datasets of different species density and taxonomic range are rarely topologically consistent because of missing phylogenetic signal, non-phylogenetic signal and error. In this study, we first use simulations to show that taxon sampling unequally affects nodes in a gene tree, which likely contributes to controversial conclusions from taxon sampling experiments and contradicting species phylogenies such as for the boreoeutherians. Hence, because it is unlikely that a large gene tree can be reconstructed correctly based on a single optimized dataset, we take a two-step approach for the construction of model gene trees. First, stable and unstable clades are identified by comparing phylogenetic trees inferred from multiple datasets and data types (nucleotide, amino acid, codon) from the same gene family. Subsequently, data subsets are optimized for the analysis of individual uncertain clades. Results are summarized in form of a model tree that illustrates the evolutionary relationship of gene loci. A case study shows how a seemingly complex gene phylogeny becomes increasingly consistent with the reference species tree by attentive taxon sampling and subtree analysis. The procedure is progressively introduced to SwissTree (http://swisstree.vital-it.ch), a resource of high confidence model gene (locus) trees.

Several lines of evidence indicate that competition with fox sparrows for winter food reduced over-winter survival in juvenile song sparrows, enforcing population decline despite an increase in annual reproductive rate in song sparrows over the same period. In contrast, we found no evidence of interspecific competition for resources during the breeding season. Our results indicate that in the absence of a sufficient ecological or evolutionary shift in niche dimension, range expansions by dominant competitors have the potential to cause the extirpation of historically resident species when competitive interactions between them are strong and resources not equitably partitioned.",

    "abstract": "Natural populations often grow, shrink, and migrate over time. Demographic processes such as these can impact genome-wide levels of genetic diversity. In addition, genetic variation in functional regions of the genome can be altered by natural selection, which drives adaptive mutations to higher frequencies or purges deleterious ones. Such selective processes impact not only the sites directly under selection but also nearby neutral variation through genetic linkage through processes referred to as genetic hitch-hiking in the context of positive selection and background selection (BGS) in the context of purifying selection. While there is extensive literature examining the impact of selection at linked sites at demographic equilibrium, less is known about how non-equilibrium demographic processes impact the effects of hitchhiking and BGS. Utilizing a global sample of human whole-genome sequences from the Thousand Genomes Project and extensive simulations, we investigate how non-equilibrium demographic processes magnify and dampen the consequences of selection at linked sites across the human genome. When binning the genome by inferred strength of BGS, we observe that, compared to Africans, non-African populations have experienced larger proportional decreases in neutral genetic diversity in such regions. We replicate these findings in admixed populations by showing that non-African ancestral components of the genome have also been impacted more severely in these regions. We attribute these differences to the strong, sustained/recurrent population bottlenecks that non-Africans experienced as they migrated out of Africa and throughout the globe. Furthermore, we observe a strong correlation between FST and inferred strength of BGS, suggesting a stronger rate of genetic drift. Forward simulations of human demographic history with a model of BGS support these observations. Our results show that non-equilibrium demography significantly alters the consequences selection at linked sites and support the need for more work investigating the dynamic process of multiple evolutionary forces operating in concert.\\n\\nAuthor summaryPatterns of genetic diversity within a species are affected at broad and fine scales by population size changes (\\\"demography\\\") and natural selection. From both population genetics theory and observation of genomic sequence data, it is known that demography can alter genome-wide average neutral genetic diversity. Additionally, natural selection can affect neutral genetic diversity regionally across the genome via selection at linked sites. During this process, natural selection acting on adaptive or deleterious variants in the genome will also impact diversity at nearby neutral sites due to genetic linkage. However, less is well known about the dynamic changes to diversity that occur in regions impacted by selection at linked sites when a population undergoes a size change. We characterize these dynamic changes using thousands of human genomes and find that the population size changes experienced by humans have shaped the consequences of linked selection across the genome. In particular, population contractions, such as those experienced by non-Africans, have disproportionately decreased neutral diversity in regions of the genome inferred to be under strong background selection (i.e., selection at linked sites that is caused by natural selection acting on deleterious variants), resulting in large differences between African and non-African populations.",

    "abstract": "We develop a novel importance sampler to compute the full likelihood function of a demographic or structural scenario given the site frequency spectrum (SFS) at a locus free of intra-locus recombination. This sampler, instead of representing the hidden genealogy of a sample of individuals by a labelled binary tree, uses the minimal level of information about such a tree that is needed for the likelihood of the SFS and thus takes advantage of the huge reduction in the size of the state space that needs to be integrated. We assume that the population may have demographically changed and may be non-panmictically structured, as reflected by the branch lengths and the topology of the genealogical tree of the sample, respectively. We also assume that mutations conform to the infinitely-many-sites model. We achieve this by a controlled Markov process that generates  particles in the hidden space of SFS histories which are always compatible with the observed SFS.\\n\\nTo produce the particles, we use Aldous Beta-splitting model for a one parameter family of prior distributions over genealogical topologies or shapes (including that of the Kingman coalescent) and allow the branch lengths or epoch times to have a parametric family of priors specified by a model of demography (including exponential growth and bottleneck models). Assuming independence across unlinked loci, we can estimate the likelihood of a population scenario based on a large collection of independent SFS by an importance sampling scheme, using the (unconditional) distribution of the genealogies under this scenario when the latter is available. When it is not available, we instead compute the joint likelihood of the tree balance parameter {beta} assuming that the tree topology follows Aldous Beta-splitting model, and of the demographic scenario determining the distribution of the inter-coalescence times or epoch times in the genealogy of a sample, in order to at least distinguish different equivalence classes of population scenarios leading to different tree balances and epoch times. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the capabilities of the approach with publicly available code.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPersistent bacterial bronchitis is a leading cause of chronic wet cough in young children. This study aimed to characterise the respiratory bacterial microbiota of healthy children and to assess the impact of the changes associated with the development of persistent bacterial bronchitis.\\n\\nBlind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with persistent bacterial bronchitis, with an additional directed sample obtained from persistent bacterial bronchitis patients. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assay prior to microbial community analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\\n\\nNo significant difference in bacterial diversity or community composition (R2 = 0.01, P = 0.36) was observed between paired blind and non-blind brushes, showing that blind brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. This has important implications for collecting lower respiratory samples from healthy children. A significant decrease in bacterial diversity (P < 0.001) and change in community composition (R2 = 0.08, P = 0.004) was observed between controls and patients. Bacterial communities within patients with PBB were dominated by Proteobacteria, and indicator species analysis showed that Haemophilus and Neisseria were significantly associated with the patient group. In 15 (52.9%) cases the dominant organism by sequencing was not identified by standard routine clinical culture.\\n\\nThe bacteria present in the lungs of patients with persistent bacterial bronchitis were less diverse in terms of richness and evenness. The results validate the clinical diagnosis, and suggest that more attention to bacterial communities in children with chronic cough may lead to more rapid recognition of this condition with earlier treatment and reduction in disease burden.",

    "abstract": "Human motor control requires the coordination of muscle activity under the anatomical constraints imposed by the musculoskeletal system. Interactions within the central nervous system are fundamental to motor coordination, but the principles governing functional integration remain poorly understood. We used network analysis to investigate the relationship between anatomical and functional connectivity amongst 36 muscles. Anatomical networks were defined by the physical connections between muscles and functional networks were based on intermuscular coherence assessed during postural tasks. We found a modular structure of functional networks that was strongly shaped by the anatomical constraints of the musculoskeletal system. Changes in postural tasks were associated with a frequency-dependent reconfiguration of the coupling between functional modules. These findings reveal distinct patterns of functional interactions between muscles involved in flexibly organising muscle activity during postural control. Our network approach to the motor system offers a unique window into the neural circuitry driving the musculoskeletal system.",

    "abstract": "During value-based decision making, we often evaluate the value of each option sequentially by shifting our attention, even when the options are presented simultaneously. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been suggested to encode value during value-based decision making. Yet it is not known how its activity is modulated by attention shifts. We investigated this question by employing a passive viewing task that allowed us to disentangle effects of attention, value, choice and eye movement. We found that the attention modulated OFC activity through a winner-take-all mechanism. When we attracted the monkeys attention covertly, the OFC neuronal activity reflected the reward value of the newly attended cue. The shift of attention could be explained by a normalization model. Our results strongly argue for the hypothesis that the OFC neuronal activity represents the value of covertly attended item. They provide important insights toward the neural mechanism of value-based decision making.",

    "abstract": "Morphine antinociceptive tolerance is highly correlated with its poor ability to promote mu-opioid- receptor (MOR) endocytosis. Our objective was to discover a novel positive allosteric modulator of MOR to enhance morphine-induced MOR endocytosis. We used high-throughput screening to identify several cardiotonic steroids as positive allosteric modulators of morphine-induced MOR endocytosis having high potency and efficacy, independently of Na+/K+-ATPase inhibition. Convallatoxin was found to enhance morphine-induced MOR endocytosis through an adaptor protein 2/clathrin-dependent mechanism without regulating G protein- or {beta}-arrestin-mediated pathways. Both F243 and I292 residues of MOR were essential to the effect of convallatoxin on MOR endocytosis. Co-treatment with chronic morphine and convallatoxin reduced morphine tolerance in animal models of acute thermal pain and chronic inflammatory pain. Acute convallatoxin administration reversed morphine tolerance in morphine-tolerant mice. These findings suggest that cardiotonic steroids are potentially therapeutic for morphine side effects and open a new avenue for the study of MOR trafficking.",
