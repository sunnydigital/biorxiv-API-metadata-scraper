    "abstract": "Individuals with psychiatric disorders have elevated rates of autoimmune comorbidity and altered immune signaling. It is unclear whether these altered immunological states have a shared genetic basis with those psychiatric disorders. The present study sought to use existing summary-level data from previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) to determine if commonly varying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are shared between psychiatric and immune-related phenotypes. We estimated heritability and examined pair-wise genetic correlations using the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) and heritability estimation from summary statistics (HESS) methods. Using LDSC, we observed significant genetic correlations between immune-related disorders and several psychiatric disorders, including anorexia nervosa, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depression, obsessive compulsive disorder, schizophrenia, smoking behavior, and Tourette syndrome. Loci significantly mediating genetic correlations were identified for schizophrenia when analytically paired with Crohns disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and ulcerative colitis. We report significantly correlated loci and highlight those containing genome-wide associations and candidate genes for respective disorders. We also used the LDSC method to characterize genetic correlations amongst the immune-related phenotypes. We discuss our findings in the context of relevant genetic and epidemiological literature, as well as the limitations and caveats of the study.",

    "abstract": "Glucocorticoids--stress hormones released from the adrenal cortex--reduce phobic fear in anxiety disorders and enhance psychotherapy, possibly by reducing the retrieval of fear memories and enhancing the consolidation of new corrective memories. Glucocorticoid signaling in the basolateral amygdala can influence connected fear and memory-related cortical regions, but this is not fully understood. Previous studies investigated specific pathways moderated by glucocorticoids, for example, visual-temporal pathways; however, these analyses were limited to a-priori selected regions. Here, we performed whole-brain pattern analysis to localize phobic stimulus decoding related to the fear-reducing effect of glucocorticoids. We reanalyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a previously published study with spider-phobic patients and healthy controls. The patients received either glucocorticoids or a placebo treatment before the exposure to spider images. There was moderate evidence that patients with phobia had higher decoding of phobic content in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the left and right anterior insula compared to controls. Decoding in the ACC and the right insula showed strong evidence for correlation with experienced fear. Patients with cortisol reported a reduction of fear by 10-13%; however, there was only weak evidence for changes in neural decoding compared to placebo which was found in the precuneus, the opercular cortex, and the left cerebellum.",

    "abstract": "Human hookworm Necator Americanus (NA) causes iron deficiency anemia, as the parasite ingests blood from the gastrointestinal tract of its human host. This bioinformatics-based study focuses on eight of the cathepsin B-like cysteine proteases (CPs) of the worm to explore their pathogenic potential. CP1 - CP6, which harbored the active site cysteine residue for enzymatic activity, were relevantly observed to have N-terminal signal peptide for extracellular localization. The secretory CPs could be releasing indigenous worm heparin at the host-pathogen interface for anticoagulation purposes. CP2 and CP3 showed a novel hemoglobinase motif that could be a prerequisite for hemoglobin degradation. CP1 and CP6 shared similar enzymatic-pocket features with cathepsin B and cruzain that cleave high molecular weight kininogen for blood-thinning activity. CP1, CP2, CP3, CP5 and CP6 were predicted to bind heparin, at their C terminal domain, like human cathepsin B and cruzain non-covalently bind heparin to enhance their activity. NA CPs action in concert with heparin, have implications for anti-heparin and heparin analog design against hookworm infection.",

The key issue is that since parental lines were not available, might the reported variants have been inherited? To expand upon the limited available whole genome data on whether CRISPR-edited mice show more genetic variation, whole-genome sequencing was performed on two other mouse lines that had undergone a CRISPR-editing procedure. Again, parents were not available for either the Capn5 nor Fblim1 CRISPR-edited mouse lines, so strain controls were examined. Additionally, we also include verification of variants detected in the initial mouse line. Taken together, these whole-genome-sequencing-level results support the idea that in specific cases, CRISPR-Cas9 editing can precisely edit the genome at the organismal level and may not introduce numerous, unintended, off-target mutations.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular endosymbiont in fecting many arthropods and filarial nematodes. Little is known about the short-term evolution of Wolbachia or its interaction with its host. Wolbachia is maternally inherited, resulting in co-inheritance of mitochondrial organelles such as mtDNA. Here I explore the short-term evolution of Wolbachia, and the relationship between Wolbachia and mtDNA, using a large inbred panel of Drosophila simulans infected with the Wolbachia strain wRi. I find reduced diversity relative to expectation in both Wolbachia and mtDNA, but only mtDNA shows evidence of a recent selective sweep or population bottleneck. I estimate Wolbachia and mtDNA titre in each genotype, and I find considerable variation in both phenotypes, despite low genetic diversity in Wolbachia and mtDNA. A phylogeny of Wolbachia and of mtDNA show that both trees are largely unresolved, suggesting a recent origin of the infection and a single origin. Using Wolbachia and mtDNA titre as a phenotype, we perform an association analysis with the nuclear genome and find several regions implicated in the phenotype, including one which contains four CAAX-box protein processing genes. CAAX-box protein processing can be an important part of host-pathogen interactions in other systems, suggesting interesting directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput cell profiling experiments are characterizing cell phenotype under a broad variety of microenvironmental and therapeutic conditions. However, biological and technical variability are contributing to wide ranges of reported parameter values, even for standard cell lines grown in identical conditions. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model of cell proliferation assays that account for biological and technical variability and limitations of the experimental platforms, including (1) cell confluency effects, (2) biological variability and technical errors in pipetting, (3) biological variability in proliferation characteristics, (4) technical variability and uncertainty in measurement timing, (5) cell counting errors, and (6) the impact of limited temporal sampling. We use this model to create synthetic datasets with growth rates and measurement times typical of cancer cell cultures, and investigate the impact of the initial cell seeding density and the common practice of fitting exponential growth curves to three cell count measurements. We find that the combined sources of variability mask the sub-exponential growth characteristics of the synthetic datasets, and that researchers profiling the same cell lines under different seeding characteristics can find significant (p < 0.05) differences in the measured growth rates. Even seeding the cells at 1% of the confluent limit can cause significant (p < 0.05) differences in the measured growth rate from the ground truth. We explored the effect of reducing errors in each part of the virtual experimental system, and found the best improvements from reducing timing errors, reducing cell counting errors, or reducing the interval between measurements (to reduce the inaccuracy of the exponential growth assumption when fitting curves). Reducing biological variability and pipetting errors had the least impact, because any improvements are still masked by cell counting errors. We close with a discussion of recommended practices for high-throughput cell phenotyping and cell line identification systems.",

We advocate for the development of a & \\\"crowd forecasting system\\\"whereby real-time observations of crowds are coupled to fast and reliable models to produce rapid predictions of the crowd movement and eventually help crowd managers choose between tailored optimization strategies. Here, we propose a Bi-directional Macroscopic (BM) model as the core of such a system. Its key input is the fundamental diagram for bi-directional flows, i.e. the relation between the pedestrian fluxes and densities. We design and run a laboratory experiments involving a total of 119 participants walking in opposite directions in a circular corridor and show that the model is able to accurately capture the experimental data in a typical crowd forecasting situation. Finally, we propose a simple segregation strategy for enhancing the traffic efficiency, and use the BM model to determine the conditions under which this strategy would be beneficial. The BM model, therefore, could serve as a building block to develop on the fly prediction of crowd movements and help deploying real-time crowd optimization strategies.",

This setup can operate both simple and complex devices with 48 device valve control inputs and 18 sample inputs, with modular design for easy expansion, at a fraction of the cost of similar commercial solutions. We present a detailed step-by-step guide to building the pneumatic instrumentation, as well as instructions for custom device operation using our software, Geppetto, through an easy-to-use GUI for live on-chip valve actuation and a scripting system for experiment automation. We show robust valve actuation with near real-time software feedback and demonstrate use of the setup for high-throughput biochemical measurements on-chip.

Pressure transducers recorded the intraocular pressure (IOP). The phagocytic capacity of the trabecular meshwork was determined by fluorescent microspheres.\\n\\nResultsThe baseline IOPs in P and C were similar (P=0.82). A significant IOP elevation occurred in P at 48, 120, and 180 hours (all P<0.01, compared to baseline). The pigment did not cause a reduction in TM phagocytosis at 48 hours, when the earliest IOP elevation occurred, but at 120 hours onward (P=0.001 compared to C). This reduction did not result in an additional IOP increase at 120 or 180 hours compared to the first IOP elevation at 48 hours (P>0.05).\\n\\nConclusionIn this porcine model of pigmentary glaucoma, an IOP elevation occurs much earlier than when phagocytosis fails, suggesting that two separate mechanisms might be at work.",

    "abstract": "How epithelial cell behaviors are coordinately regulated to sculpt tissue architecture is a fundamental question in biology. Kupffer's vesicle (KV), a transient organ with a fluid - filled lumen, provides a simple system to investigate the interplay between intrinsic cellular mechanisms and external forces during epithelial morphogenesis. Using 3 - dimensional (3D) analyses of single cells we identify asymmetric cell volume changes along the anteroposterior axis of KV that coincide with asymmetric cell shape changes. Blocking ion flux prevents these cell volume changes and cell shape changes. Vertex simulations suggest cell shape changes do not depend on lumen expansion. Consistent with this prediction, asymmetric changes in KV cell volume and shape occur normally when KV lumen growth fails due to leaky cell adhesions. These results indicate ion flux mediates asymmetric cell volume changes that contribute to asymmetric cell shape changes in KV, and that these changes in epithelial morphology are separable from lumen - generated forces.",

    "abstract": "Robustness in development allows for the accumulation of neutral genetically based variation in expression, and here will be termed  genetic stochasticity . This largely neutral variation is potentially important for both evolution and complex disease phenotypes. However, it has generally only been investigated as variation exhibited in the response to large genetic perturbations. In addition, work on variation in gene expression has similarly generally been limited to being spatial, or quantitative, but because of technical restrictions not both. Here we bridge these gaps by investigating replicated quantitative spatial gene expression using rigorous statistical models, in different genotypes, sexes, and species (Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans). Using this type of quantitative approach with developmental data allows for effective comparison among conditions, including health versus disease. We apply this approach to the morphogenetic furrow, a wave of differentiation that sweeps across the developing eye disc. Within the morphogenetic furrow, we focus on four conserved morphogens, hairy, atonal, hedgehog, and Delta. Hybridization chain reaction quantitatively measures spatial gene expression, co-staining for all four genes simultaneously and with minimal effort. We find considerable variation in the spatial expression pattern of these genes in the eye between species, genotypes, and sexes. We also find that there has been evolution of the regulatory relationship between these genes. Lastly, we show that the spatial interrelationships of these genes evolved between species in the morphogenetic furrow. This is essentially the first  population genetics of development as we are able to evaluate wild type differences in spatial and quantitative gene expression at the level of genotype, species and sex.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of costly cooperation, where cooperators pay a personal cost to benefit others, requires that cooperators interact more frequently with other cooperators. This condition, called positive assortment, is known to occur in spatially-structured viscous populations, where individuals typically have low mobility and limited dispersal. However many social organisms across taxa, from cells and bacteria, to birds, fish and ungulates, are mobile, and live in populations with considerable inter-group mixing. In the absence of information regarding others traits or conditional strategies, such mixing may inhibit assortment and limit the potential for cooperation to evolve. Here we employ spatially-explicit individual-based evolutionary simulations to incorporate costs and benefits of two coevolving costly traits: cooperative and local cohesive tendencies. We demonstrate that, despite possessing no information about others traits or payoffs, mobility (via self-propulsion or environmental forcing) facilitates assortment of cooperators via a dynamically evolving difference in the cohesive tendencies of cooperators and defectors. We show analytically that this assortment can also be viewed in a multilevel selection framework, where selection for cooperation among emergent groups can overcome selection against cooperators within the groups. As a result of these dynamics, we find an oscillatory pattern of cooperation and defection that maintains cooperation even in the absence of well known mechanisms such as kin interactions, reciprocity, local dispersal or conditional strategies that require information on others strategies or payoffs. Our results offer insights into differential adhesion based mechanisms for positive assortment and reveal the possibility of cooperative aggregations in dynamic fission-fusion populations.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCooperation among animals is ubiquitous. In a cooperative interaction, the cooperator confers a benefit to its partner at a personal cost. How does natural selection favour such a costly behaviour? Classical theories argue that cooperative interactions among genetic relatives, reciprocal cooperators, or among individuals within groups in viscous population structures are necessary to maintain cooperation. However, many organisms are mobile, and live in dynamic (fission-fusion) groups that constantly merge and split. In such populations, the above mechanisms may be inadequate to explain cooperation. Here, we develop a minimal model that explicitly accounts for mobility and cohesion among organisms. We find that mobility can support cooperation via emergent dynamic groups, even in the absence of previously known mechanisms. Our results may offer insights into the evolution of cooperation in animals that live in fission fusion groups, such as birds, fish or mammals, or microbes living in turbulent media, such as in oceans or in the bloodstreams of animal hosts.",

    "abstract": "Types of T-cell responses are categorized on the basis of a limited number of molecular markers selected using a priori knowledge about T-cell immunobiology. We sought to develop a novel systems-based approach for the creation of an unbiased framework enabling assessment of antigenic-peptide specific T-cell responses in vitro. A meta-analysis of transcriptome data from PBMCs stimulated with a wide range of peptides identified patterns of gene regulation that provided an unbiased classification of types of antigen-specific responses. Further analysis yielded new insight about the molecular processes engaged following antigenic stimulation. This led for instance to the identification of transcription factors not previously studied in the context of T-cell differentiation. Taken together this profiling approach can serve as a basis for the unbiased characterization of antigen-specific responses and as a foundation for the development of novel systems-based immune profiling assays.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation of antibody-mediated immunity occurs in germinal centers (GC). It is where affinity maturation, class switching, memory and plasma cell differentiation synergize to generate specific high affinity antibodies that help both to clear and protect against reinfection of invading pathogens. Within GCs, light and dark zone are two compartments instrumental in regulating this process, by segregating T cell dependent selection and differentiation from generation of GC B cells bearing hypermutated antigen receptors. Spatial segregation of GC B cells into the two zones relies on the chemokine receptor CXCR4, with textbook models attributing high and low expression levels to a dark and light zone phenotype. This bipolarity is however not reflected in the CXCR4 expression profile of GC B cells, which is unimodal and markedly heterogeneous, indicating a continuum of intermediate CXCR4 levels rather than a binary dark or light zone phenotype. Here analysis of published BrdU pulse-chase data reveals that throughout cell cycle, average CXCR4 expression in GC B cells steadily increases by up to 75%, scaling with cell surface area. CXCR4 expression in recently divided GC B cells in G0/G1 phase shows intermediate levels compared to cells in G2 and M phase, consistent with their smaller size. The least number of CXCR4 receptors are displayed by GC B cells in G0/G1 that have not been in cell cycle for several hours. The latter, upon entering S phase however, ramp up relative CXCR4 expression twice as much as recently divided cells. Twelve hours after the BrdU pulse, labelled GC B cells, while initially in S phase, are fully desynchronized in terms of cell cycle and match the CXCR4 expression of unlabeled cells. A model is discussed in which CXCR4 expression in GC B cell increases with cell cycle and cell surface area, with highest levels in G2 and M phase, coinciding with GC B cell receptor signaling in G2 and immediately preceding activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) activity in early G1. In the model, GC B cells compete for immobilized or expressed CXCL12 on the basis of their CXCR4 expression levels, gaining a relative advantage as they progress in cell cycle, but loosing the advantage at the moment they divide.",

We sequentially infected cynomolgus macaques with simian pegivirus (SPgV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) to model HIV+HPgV co-infection. SPgV had no effect on acute-phase SIV pathogenesis - as measured by SIV viral load, CD4+ T cell destruction, and immune activation - suggesting that HPgVs protective effect is exerted primarily during the chronic phase of HIV infection. We also examined the immune response to SPgV in unprecedented detail, and found that this virus elicits virtually no activation of the immune system despite persistently high titers in the blood over long periods of time.

    "abstract": "The generation of new neurons persists into adulthood in the human hippocampus and can be modulated by the circulatory systemic environment. Hippocampal neurogenesis is important for learning and memory and is altered in Alzheimers Disease (AD). Evaluating the hippocampal neurogenic process during disease progression could therefore identify neurogenesis as an important target for AD prevention and intervention as well as a biomarker for early disease detection. In this study, we used a human hippocampal progenitor cell line to design an in vitro assay evaluating over time the neurogenic impact of the systemic milieu (i.e. serum) of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) as they either converted to AD or remained cognitively stable. Cells were exposed to serum collected over several years from the same patients. Cellular phenotyping and linear mixed effects models for repeated measures revealed that decreased proliferation, increased apoptotic hippocampal progenitor cell death and increased hippocampal neurogenesis characterized progression from MCI to AD. Using stepwise logistic regression and machine learning we show that these cellular readouts for the baseline serum sample and years of education of the patient are significant predictors of conversion from MCI to AD, already 3.5 years before AD clinical diagnosis. Finally, serum proteomic analyses indicated pathways linked to the cellular readouts distinguishing MCI to AD converters from non-converters. The proposed assay is thus not only promising for AD pre-clinical diagnosis, but it also provides a proxy into temporal changes of the hippocampal neurogenic process during disease progression.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryIn this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the systemic environment (i.e. blood serum) of mild cognitively impaired patients differentially alters human hippocampal progenitor cell fate to predict conversion to Alzheimers Disease up to 3.5 years before clinical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decision-making relies on the gradual accumulation of noisy sensory evidence until a specified boundary is reached and an appropriate response is made. It might be assumed that adding noise to a stimulus, or to the neural systems involved in its processing, would interfere with the decision process. But it has been suggested that adding an optimal amount of noise can, under appropriate conditions, enhance the quality of subthreshold signals in nonlinear systems, a phenomenon known as stochastic-resonance. Here we asked whether perceptual decisions obey these stochastic resonance principles by adding noise directly to the visual cortex using transcranial-random-noise stimulation (tRNS) while participants judged the direction of motion in foveally presented random-dot motion arrays. Consistent with the stochastic resonance account, we found that adding tRNS bilaterally to visual cortex enhanced decision-making when stimuli were below, but not above, perceptual threshold. We modelled the data under a drift diffusion framework to isolate the specific components of the multi-stage decision process that were influenced by the addition of neural noise. This modelling showed that tRNS increased drift rate, which indexes the rate of evidence accumulation, but had no effect on bound separation or non-decision time. These results were specific to bilateral stimulation of visual cortex; control experiments involving unilateral stimulation of left and right visual areas showed no influence of random noise stimulation. Our study is the first to provide causal evidence that perceptual decision-making is susceptible to a stochastic resonance effect induced by tRNS, and that this effect arises from selective enhancement of the rate of evidence accumulation for sub-threshold sensory events.",

    "abstract": "Brain aging is marked by cognitive decline and susceptibility to neurodegeneration. Caloric-restriction (CR) increases neurogenesis, improves memory function, and protects from age-associated neurological disorders. Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, are vital to normal CNS cellular and memory functions, and are dysregulated with aging. The beneficial effects of CR have been proposed to work through epigenetic processes, but this is largely unexplored. We therefore tested whether life-long CR prevents age-related DNA methylation changes in the brain. Hippocampal DNA from young (3 months) and old (24 months) male mice fed ad libitum and 24 month old mice fed a 40% calorierestricted diet from 3 months of age were examined by genome-wide bisulfite sequencing to measure methylation with base-specificity. Over 27 million CG and CH (non-CG) sites were examined. Of the ~40,000 differentially methylated CGs (dmCGs) and ~80,000 CHs (dmCHs) with aging, >1/3 were prevented by CR and were found across genomic regulatory regions and gene pathways. CR also caused alterations to CG and CH methylation at sites not differentially methylated with aging, and these CR-specific changes demonstrated a different pattern of regulatory element and gene pathway enrichment than those affected by aging. CR-specific DNMT1 and TET3 promoter hypermethylation corresponded to reduced gene expression. These findings demonstrate that CR attenuates age-related CG and CH hippocampal methylation changes, in combination with CR-specific methylation that may also contribute to the neuroprotective effects of CR. The prevention of age-related methylation alterations is also consistent with the pro-longevity effects of CR working through an epigenetic mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Current protocols for delivering radiotherapy are based primarily on tumour stage and nodal and metastases status, even though it is well known that tumours and their microenvironments are highly heterogeneous. It is well established that the local oxygen tension plays an important role in radiation-induced cell death, with hypoxic tumour regions responding poorly to irradiation. Therefore, to improve radiation response, it is important to understand more fully the spatiotemporal distribution of oxygen within a growing tumour before and during fractionated radiation. To this end, we have extended a spatially-resolved mathematical model of tumour growth first proposed by Greenspan (Stud. Appl. Math., 1972) to investigate the effects of oxygen heterogeneity on radiation-induced cell death. In more detail, cell death due to radiation at each location in the tumour, as determined by the well-known linear-quadratic model, is assumed also to depend on the local oxygen concentration. The oxygen concentration is governed by a reaction-diffusion equation that is coupled to an integro-differential equation that determines the size of the assumed spherically-symmetric tumour. We combine numerical and analytical techniques to investigate radiation response of tumours with different intra-tumoral oxygen distribution profiles. Model simulations reveal a rapid transient increase in hypoxia upon re-growth of the tumour spheroid post-irradiation. We investigate the response to different radiation fractionation schedules and identify a tumour-specific relationship between inter-fraction time and dose per fraction to achieve cure. The rich dynamics exhibited by the model suggest that spatial heterogeneity may be important for predicting tumour response to radiotherapy for clinical applications.",

Here, we identified 1,736 post-transcriptionally impaired DNMs (piDNMs), and prioritized 1,482 candidate genes in four neuropsychiatric disorders from 7,748 families. Our results revealed higher prevalence of piDNMs in the probands than in controls (P = 8.19x10-17), and piDNM-harboring genes were enriched for epigenetic modifications and neuronal or synaptic functions. Moreover, we identified 86 piDNM-containing genes forming convergent co-expression modules and intensive protein-protein interactions in at least two neuropsychiatric disorders. These cross-disorder genes carrying piDNMs could form interaction network centered on RNA binding proteins, suggesting a shared post-transcriptional etiology underlying these disorders. Our findings illustrate the significant contribution of piDNMs to four neuropsychiatric disorders, and lay emphasis on combining functional and network-based evidences to identify regulatory causes of genetic disorders.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) marked a major shift in our understanding of how light is processed by the mammalian brain. These ipRGCs influence multiple functions not directly related to vision such as the synchronization of circadian rhythmicity, pupil constriction, the regulation of alertness and sleep, as well as the modulation of cognition. More recently, it was demonstrated that ipRGCs may also contribute to basic visual functions. The impact of ipRGCs on visual functions, independently of image forming photoreceptors, remains however difficult to isolate, particularly in humans. We previously showed that exposure to intense monochromatic blue light (465nm) induced awareness of light in a forced choice task in three rare totally visually blind individuals without detectable rod and cone function, but who retained non-visual responses to light, very likely via ipRGCs. The neural foundation of such light awareness in the absence of conscious vision is unknown, however. In this study, we characterized the brain activity of these three rare participants using electroencephalography (EEG), and demonstrate that unconsciously perceived light triggers an early and reliable transient desynchronization (i.e. decreased power) of the alpha EEG rhythm (8-14 Hz) over the occipital cortex. These results provide compelling insight into how ipRGC may contribute to transient changes in ongoing brain activity. They suggest that occipital alpha rhythm synchrony, which is typically linked to the visual system, is modulated by ipRGCs photoreception; a process that may contribute to the awareness of light in those blind individuals.",

Here, we compare in vivo synaptic properties of two neuronal classes in the C. elegans central nervous system, using VGLUT-pHluorin to monitor synaptic vesicle exocytosis and retrieval in intact animals. We show that the glutamatergic sensory neurons AWCON and ASH have distinct synaptic dynamics associated with tonic and phasic synaptic properties, respectively. Exocytosis in ASH and AWCON is differentially affected by SNARE-complex regulators that are present in both neurons: phasic ASH release is strongly dependent on UNC-13, whereas tonic AWCON release relies upon UNC-18 and on the protein kinase C homolog PKC-1. Exocytosis and retrieval each have two timescales in AWCON but one major timescale in ASH. Strong stimuli that elicit high calcium levels also increase exocytosis and retrieval rates in AWCON, generating distinct tonic and evoked synaptic modes. These results highlight the differential deployment of shared presynaptic proteins in neuronal cell type-specific functions.",
