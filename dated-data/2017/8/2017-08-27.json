    "abstract": "BackgroundOncology drugs are only effective in a small proportion of cancer patients. Our current ability to identify these responsive patients before treatment is still poor in most cases. Thus, there is a pressing need to discover response markers for marketed and research oncology drugs in order to improve patient survival, reduce healthcare costs and enhance success rates in clinical trials. Screening these drugs against a large panel of cancer cell lines has been employed to discover new genomic markers of in vitro drug response, which can now be further evaluated on more accurate tumour models. However, while the identification of discriminative markers among thousands of candidate drug-gene associations in the data is error-prone, an appraisal of the effectiveness of such detection task is currently lacking.\\n\\nResultsHere we present a new non-parametric method to measuring the discriminative power of a drug-gene association. This is enabled by the identification of an auxiliary threshold posing this task as a binary classification problem. Unlike parametric statistical tests, the adopted non-parametric test has the advantage of not making strong assumptions about the data distorting the identification of genomic markers. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark to further validate these markers in vitro using more recent data not used to identify the markers. The application of this new methodology has led to the identification of 128 new genomic markers distributed across 61% of the analysed drugs, including 5 drugs without previously known markers, which were missed by the MANOVA test initially applied to analyse data from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer consortium.\\n\\nAbbreviation",

To address this, we evolve genetically diverse populations of budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, consisting of diploid cells with unique haplotype combinations. We study the asexual evolution of these populations under selective inhibition with chemotherapeutic drugs by time-resolved whole-genome sequencing and phenotyping. All populations undergo clonal expansions driven by de novo mutations, but remain genetically and phenotypically diverse. The clones exhibit widespread genomic instability, rendering recessive de novo mutations homozygous and refining pre-existing variation. Finally, we decompose the fitness contributions of pre-existing and de novo mutations by creating a large recombinant library of adaptive mutations in an ensemble of genetic backgrounds. Both pre-existing and de novo mutations substantially contribute to fitness, and the relative fitness of pre-existing variants sets a selective threshold for new adaptive mutations.",

    "abstract": "Genetic elements compete for transmission through meiosis, when haploid gametes are created from a diploid parent. Selfish elements can enhance their transmission through meiotic drive, in violation of Mendels Law of Segregation. In female meiosis, selfish elements drive by preferentially attaching to the egg side of the spindle, which implies some asymmetry between the two sides of the spindle, but molecular mechanisms underlying spindle asymmetry are unknown. Here we show that CDC42 signaling from the cell cortex regulates microtubule tyrosination to induce spindle asymmetry, and non-Mendelian segregation depends on this asymmetry. These signals depend on cortical polarization directed by chromosomes, which are positioned near the cortex to allow the asymmetric cell division. Thus, selfish meiotic drivers exploit the asymmetry inherent in female meiosis to bias their transmission.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBiomarkers are a key component of precision medicine. However, full clinical integration of biomarkers has been met with challenges, partly attributed to analytical difficulties. It has been shown that biomarker reproducibility is susceptible to data preprocessing approaches. Here, we systematically evaluated machine-learning ensembles of preprocessing methods as a general strategy to improve biomarker performance for prediction of survival from early breast cancer.\\n\\nResultsWe risk stratified breast cancer patients into either low-risk or high-risk groups based on four published hypoxia signatures (Buffa, Winter, Hu, and Sorensen), using 24 different preprocessing approaches for microarray normalization. The 24 binary risk profiles determined for each hypoxia signature were combined using a random forest to evaluate the efficacy of a preprocessing ensemble classifier. We demonstrate that the best way of merging preprocessing methods varies from signature to signature, and that there is likely no  best preprocessing pipeline that is universal across datasets, highlighting the need to evaluate ensembles of preprocessing algorithms. Further, we developed novel signatures for each preprocessing method and the risk classifications from each were incorporated in a meta-random forest model. Interestingly, the classification of these biomarkers and its ensemble show striking consistency, demonstrating that similar intrinsic biological information are being faithfully represented. As such, these classification patterns further confirm that there is a subset of patients whose prognosis is consistently challenging to predict.\\n\\nConclusionsPerformance of different prognostic signatures varies with pre-processing method. A simple classifier by unanimous voting of classifications is a reliable way of improving on single preprocessing methods. Future signatures will likely require integration of intrinsic and extrinsic clinico-pathological variables to better predict disease-related outcomes.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Cell protrusion plays important roles in cell migration by pushing plasma membrane forward. Cryptic lamellipodia induce the protrusion of submarginal cells in collective cell migration where cells are attached and move together. Although computational image analysis of cell protrusion has been done extensively, the study on protrusion activities of cryptic lamellipodia is limited due to difficulties in image segmentation. This study seeks to aid in the computational analysis of submarginal cell protrusion in collective cell migration by using deep learning to detect the cryptic lamellipodial edges from fluorescence time-lapse movies. Due to the noisy features within overlapping cells, the conventional image analysis algorithms such as Canny edge detector and intensity thresholding are limited. By combining Canny edge detector, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and local intensity thresholding, we were able to detect cryptic lamellipodial edges of submarginal cells with high accuracy from the fluorescence time-lapse movies of PtK1 cells stained with a plasma membrane marker. We used relatively small effort to prepare the training set to train the CNN to detect the cryptical lamellipodial edges in fluorescence time-lapse movies. This work demonstrates that deep learning can be combined with the conventional image analysis algorithms to facilitate the computational analysis of highly complex time-lapse movies of collective cell migration.",

Dysregulation of Ras: Raf signaling stimulates cancers. We investigate the C-Raf RBD and CRD regions when bound to oncogenic K-Ras4B at the membrane. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the membrane plays an integral role in regulating the configurational ensemble of the complex. Remarkably, the complex samples a few states dynamically, reflecting a competition between C-Raf CRD and K-Ras4B- membrane interactions. This competition arises because the interaction between the RBD and K-Ras is strong and the linker between the RBD and CRD is short. This study reveals a mechanism that maintains a modest binding for the overall complex at the membrane to facilitate fast signaling processes. It is likely a common mechanism for other multi-protein, if not multidomain proteins at membranes.",

    "abstract": "A key mutational process in cancer is structural variation, in which rearrangements delete, amplify or reorder genomic segments ranging in size from kilobases to whole chromosomes. We developed methods to group, classify and describe structural variants, applied to >2,500 cancer genomes. Nine signatures of structural variation emerged. Deletions have trimodal size distribution; assort unevenly across tumour types and patients; enrich in late-replicating regions; and correlate with inversions. Tandem duplications also have trimodal size distribution, but enrich in early-replicating regions, as do unbalanced translocations. Replication-based mechanisms of rearrangement generate varied chromosomal structures with low-level copy number gains and frequent inverted rearrangements. One prominent structure consists of 1-7 templates copied from distinct regions of the genome strung together within one locus. Such  cycles of templated insertions correlate with tandem duplications, frequently activating the telomerase gene, TERT, in liver cancer. Cancers access many rearrangement processes, flexibly sculpting the genome to maximise oncogenic potential.",

    "abstract": "Proper cerebellar development is dependent on tightly regulated proliferation, migration, and differentiation events. Disruptions in any of these leads to a range of cerebellar phenotypes from ataxia to childhood tumors. Animal models have shown proper regulation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling is crucial for normal cerebellar architecture and increased signaling leads to cerebellar tumor formation. Primary cilia are known to be required for the proper regulation of multiple developmental signaling pathways, including Shh. Tetratricopeptide Repeat Domain 21B (Ttc21b) is required for proper primary cilia form and function and is primarily thought to restrict Shh signaling. Here we investigated a role for Ttc21b in cerebellar development. Surprisingly, Ttc21b ablation in Bergmann glia resulted in accumulation of ectopic granule cells in the lower/ posterior lobes of the cerebellum and a reduction in Shh signaling. Ttc21b ablation in just Purkinje cells resulted in a similar, phenotype seen in fewer cells, but across the entire extent of the cerebellum. These results suggest that Ttc21b expression is required for Bergmann glia structure and signaling in the developing cerebellum, and in some contexts, augments, rather than attenuates, Shh signaling.",

    "abstract": "Human herpesvirus-6A and -6B (HHV-6) are betaherpesviruses that reach >90% seroprevalence in the adult population. Unique among human herpesviruses, HHV-6 can integrate into the subtelomeric regions of human chromosomes; when this occurs in germ line cells it causes a condition called inherited chromosomally integrated HHV-6 (iciHHV-6). To date, only two complete genomes are available for HHV-6B. Using a custom capture panel for HHV-6B, we report near-complete genomes from 61 isolates of HHV-6B from active infections (20 from Japan, 35 from New York state, and 6 from Uganda), and 64 strains of iciHHV-6B (mostly from North America). We also report partial genome sequences from 10 strains of iciHHV-6A. Although the overall sequence diversity of HHV-6 is limited relative to other human herpesviruses, our sequencing identified geographical clustering of HHV-6B sequences from active infections, as well as evidence of recombination among HHV-6B strains. One strain of active HHV-6B was more divergent than any other HHV-6B previously sequenced. In contrast to the active infections, sequences from iciHHV-6 cases showed reduced sequence diversity. Strikingly, multiple iciHHV-6B sequences from unrelated individuals were found to be completely identical, consistent with a founder effect. However, several iciHHV-6B strains intermingled with strains from active pediatric infection, consistent with the hypothesis that intermittent de novo integration into host germline cells can occur during active infection Comparative genomic analysis of the newly sequenced strains revealed numerous instances where conflicting annotations between the two existing reference genomes could be resolved. Combining these findings with transcriptome sequencing and shotgun proteomics, we reannotated the HHV-6B genome and found multiple instances of novel splicing and genes that hitherto had gone unannotated. The results presented here constitute a significant genomic resource for future studies on the detection, diversity, and control of HHV-6.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryHHV-6 is a ubiquitous large DNA virus that is the most common cause of febrile seizures and reactivates in allogeneic stem cell patients. It also has the unique ability among human herpesviruses to be integrated into the genome of every cell via integration in the germ line, a condition called inherited chromosomally integrated (ici)HHV-6, which affects approximately 1% of the population. To date, very little is known about the comparative genomics of HHV-6. We sequenced 61 isolates of HHV-6B from active infections, 64 strains of iciHHV-6B, and 10 strains of iciHHV-6A. We found geographic clustering of HHV-6B strains from active infections. In contrast, iciHHV-6B had reduced sequence diversity, with many identical sequences of iciHHV-6 found in individuals not known to share recent common ancestry, consistent with a founder effect from a remote common ancestor with iciHHV-6. We also combined our genomic analysis with transcriptome sequencing and shotgun proteomics to correct previous misannotations of the HHV-6 genome.",

Under this real-world scenario, performance typically declines beyond a critical load among low-performing subjects, a phenomenon known as working memory overload. We used a fronto-parietal cortical model to test the hypothesis that high-performing subjects select a manageable number of items for storage, thereby avoiding overload. The model accounts for behavioural and electrophysiological data from high-performing subjects in a parameter regime where competitive encoding in its prefrontal network selects items for storage, inter-areal projections sustain their representations after stimulus offset, and weak dynamics in its parietal network limit their mutual interference. Violation of these principles accounts for these data among low-performing subjects, implying that poor visual working memory performance reflects poor control over fronto-parietal circuitry, and making testable predictions for experiments.",

    "abstract": "For the past decade, research on the storage limitations of working memory has been dominated by two fundamentally different hypotheses. On the one hand, the contents of working memory may be stored in a limited number of  slots, each with a fixed resolution. On the other hand, any number of items may be stored, but with decreasing resolution. These two hypotheses have been invaluable in characterizing the computational structure of working memory, but neither provides a complete account of the available experimental data, nor speaks to the neural basis of the limitations it characterizes. To address these shortcomings, we simulated a multiple-item working memory task with a cortical network model, the cellular resolution of which allowed us to quantify the coding fidelity of memoranda as a function of memory load, as measured by the discriminability, regularity and reliability of simulated neural spiking. Our simulations account for a wealth of neural and behavioural data from human and non-human primate studies, and they demonstrate that feedback inhibition not only lowers capacity, but also lowers coding fidelity by all three measures. Because the strength of inhibition scales with the number of items stored by the network, increasing this number progressively lowers fidelity until capacity is reached. As such, the model provides a mechanistic explanation for experimental data showing that working memory precision decreases with increasing memory load before levelling off at capacity. Crucially, the model makes specific, testable predictions for neural activity on multiple-item working memory tasks.",

In this study, we collected the data from H7N9 epidemics and H7N9-related Baidu Search Index (BSI) in China between September 2013 and June 2017. And we observed a strong correlation between the numbers of Influenza A (H7N9) cases and H7N9-related BSI in Guangdong province and Shanghai municipality (p<0.001). Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were constructed for the dynamic estimation of seasonal H7N9 outbreaks in 2016-2017 and the online search data acted as an external regressor with the historical H7N9 epidemic data in the forecasting model to improve the quality of predictions. Predictions by the models closely matched the actual numbers of reported cases during current H7N9 epidemic season. Especially, the estimated numbers of reported cases sharply increased to reach 49.88 (95% CI: 0-194.05) in Guangdong and 9.05 (95% CI: 0-37.43) in Shanghai from December 2016 to June 2017. Moreover, this accessible and flexible dynamic forecast model could be used in the monitoring of H7N9 virus to provide advanced warning of future emerging infection diseases.\\n\\nAuthor summaryAs the availability and popularity of the internet has greatly increased in recent years, an increasing number of cyber users, including patients and their family members, search online for health information on personal computers (PCs) and mobile phones (MPs) before seeking medical attention, making it possible to investigate the influenza prevalence by monitoring changes in frequencies of uses of particular search terms. In this study, we collected the data from H7N9 epidemics and H7N9-related Baidu Search Index (BSI) in China between September 2013 and June 2017. And then, we showed a strong correlation between the numbers of Influenza A (H7N9) cases and H7N9-related BSI in Guangdong province and Shanghai municipality (p<0.001). Furthermore, we reconstructed an improved dynamic forecasting method for outbreaks of H7N9 influenza using Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to predict future patterns of H7N9 transmission and the online search data acted as an external regressor with the historical H7N9 epidemic data in the forecasting model to improve the quality of predictions. Our results suggest that data from the Baidu search engine, combed with data from a traditional disease surveillance system, may be considered for early detection of H7N9 influenza outbreaks in mainland China.",
