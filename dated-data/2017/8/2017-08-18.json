    "abstract": "Local excitatory connections in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) are stronger and more prevalent between neurons that share similar functional response features. However, the details of how functional rules for local connectivity shape neuronal responses in V1 remain unknown. We hypothesised that complex responses to visual stimuli may arise as a consequence of rules for selective excitatory connectivity within the local network in the superficial layers of mouse V1. In mouse V1 many neurons respond to overlapping grating stimuli (plaid stimuli) with highly selective and facilitatory responses, which are not simply predicted by responses to single gratings presented alone. This complexity is surprising, since excitatory neurons in V1 are considered to be mainly tuned to single preferred orientations. Here we examined the consequences for visual processing of two alternative connectivity schemes: in the first case, local connections are aligned with visual properties inherited from feedforward input (a  like-to-like scheme specifically connecting neurons that share similar preferred orientations); in the second case, local connections group neurons into excitatory subnetworks that combine and amplify multiple feedforward visual properties (a  feature binding scheme). By comparing predictions from large scale computational models with in vivo recordings of visual representations in mouse V1, we found that responses to plaid stimuli were best explained by a assuming  feature binding connectivity. Unlike under the  like-to-like scheme, selective amplification within feature-binding excitatory subnetworks replicated experimentally observed facilitatory responses to plaid stimuli; explained selective plaid responses not predicted by grating selectivity; and was consistent with broad anatomical selectivity observed in mouse V1. Our results show that visual feature binding can occur through local recurrent mechanisms without requiring feedforward convergence, and that such a mechanism is consistent with visual responses and cortical anatomy in mouse V1.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe brain is a highly complex structure, with abundant connectivity between nearby neurons in the neocortex, the outermost and evolutionarily most recent part of the brain. Although the network architecture of the neocortex can appear disordered, connections between neurons seem to follow certain rules. These rules most likely determine how information flows through the neural circuits of the brain, but the relationship between particular connectivity rules and the function of the cortical network is not known. We built models of visual cortex in the mouse, assuming distinct rules for connectivity, and examined how the various rules changed the way the models responded to visual stimuli. We also recorded responses to visual stimuli of populations of neurons in anaesthetised mice, and compared these responses with our model predictions. We found that connections in neocortex probably follow a connectivity rule that groups together neurons that differ in simple visual properties, to build more complex representations of visual stimuli. This finding is surprising because primary visual cortex is assumed to support mainly simple visual representations. We show that including specific rules for non-random connectivity in cortical models, and precisely measuring those rules in cortical tissue, is essential to understanding how information is processed by the brain.",

    "abstract": "Using successful genome-wide association results in psychiatry for drug repurposing is an ongoing challenge. Databases collecting drug targets and gene annotations are growing and can be harnessed to shed a new light on psychiatric disorders. We used GWAS summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genetics Consortium (PGC) Schizophrenia working group and a repositioning model for schizophrenia by testing the enrichment of antipsychotics. As sample size increases, schizophrenia GWAS results show increasing enrichment for known antipsychotic drugs, selective calcium channel blockers, and antiepileptics. Each of these therapeutical classes targets different gene subnetworks. We identify 162 Bonferroni-significant druggable genes, and 128 FDR-significant biological pathways related to neurons, synapses, genic intolerance, membrane transport, epilepsy, and mental disorders. These results suggest that, in schizophrenia, current well-powered GWAS results can reliably detect known schizophrenia drugs and thus may hold considerable potential for the identification of new therapeutic leads. Moreover, antiepileptics and calcium channel blockers may provide repurposing opportunities. This study also reveals significant pathways in schizophrenia that were not identified previously, and provides a workflow for pathway analysis and drug repurposing using GWAS results.",

    "abstract": "Premise of the StudyPhylogenetic support has been difficult to evaluate within the plant tree of life partly due to the difficulty of distinguishing conflicted versus poorly informed branches. As datasets continue to expand in both breadth and depth, new support measures are needed that are more efficient and informative.\\n\\nMethodsWe describe the Quartet Sampling (QS) method, a quartet-based evaluation system that synthesizes several phylogenetic and genomic analytical approaches. QS characterizes discordance in large-sparse and genome-wide datasets, overcoming issues of alignment sparsity and distinguishing strong conflict from weak support. We test QS with simulations and recent plant phylogenies inferred from variously sized datasets.\\n\\nKey ResultsQS scores demonstrate convergence with increasing replicates and are not strongly affected by branch depth. Patterns of QS support from different phylogenies leads to a coherent understanding of ancestral branches defining key disagreements, including the relationships of Ginkgo to cycads, magnoliids to monocots and eudicots, and mosses to liverworts. The relationships of ANA grade angiosperms, major monocot groups, bryophytes, and fern families are likely highly discordant in their evolutionary histories, rather than poorly informed. QS can also detect discordance due to introgression in phylogenomic data.\\n\\nConclusionsThe QS method represents an efficient and effective synthesis of phylogenetic tests that offer more comprehensive and specific information on branch support than conventional measures. The QS method corroborates growing evidence that phylogenomic investigations that incorporate discordance testing are warranted to reconstruct the complex evolutionary histories surrounding in particular ANA grade angiosperms, monocots, and non-vascular plants.",

    "abstract": "Molecular basis of toxin gene diversity among snakes is poorly understood. Lack of whole genome sequence information for most snakes makes studies on toxin genes and their orthologous counterparts difficult. One of the challenges in studying snake genomes is the acquisition of biological material from live animals, especially from the venomous ones. Additionally, in certain geographies, Government permission is required to handle live snakes making the process cumbersome and time-consuming. Here, we report comparative sequence analyses of toxin genes from Russells viper (Daboia russelii) using whole-genome sequencing data obtained from the skin exuviate. In addition to the comparative analyses of 46 toxin-associated proteins, we present evidence of unique sequence motifs in five key toxin-associated protein domains; nerve growth factor (NGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), Kunitz/Bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (Kunitz BPTI), cysteine-rich secretory proteins, antigen 5, and pathogenesis-related 1 proteins (CAP) and cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP). We compared the venom-associated domains from Russells viper with those from both venomous and non-venomous vertebrates and invertebrates. The in silico study on structures identified V11 and T35 in the NGF domain; F23 and A29 in the PDGF domain; N69, K2 and A5 in the CAP domain; and Q17 in the CRISP domain to be responsible for differences in the largest pockets across the protein domain structures in New World vipers, Old World vipers and elapids. Similarly, residues F10, Y11 and E20 appear to play an important role in the protein structures across the kunitz protein domain of viperids and elapids. Our study sheds light on the uniqueness of these key toxin-associated proteins and their evolution in vipers.\\n\\nData deposition: Russells viper sequence data is deposited in the NCBI SRA database under the accession number SRR5506741 and the GenBank accession numbers for the individual venom-associated genes is provided in Table S1.",

We sought to predict novel genes involved in Drosophila learning and long-term memory from existing public high-throughput data. We performed an analysis using PILGRM, which analyzes public gene expression compendia using machine learning. We evaluated the top prediction alongside genes involved in learning and memory in IMP, an interface for functional relationship networks. We identified Grunge/Atrophin (Gug/Atro), a transcriptional repressor, histone deacetylase, as our top candidate. We find, through multiple, distinct assays, that Gug has an active role as a modulator of memory retention in the fly and its function is required in the adult mushroom body. Depletion of Gug specifically in neurons of the adult mushroom body, after cell division and neuronal development is complete, suggests that Gug function is important for memory retention through regulation of neuronal activity, and not by altering neurodevelopment. Our study provides a previously uncharacterized role for Gug as a possible regulator of neuronal plasticity at the interface of memory retention and memory extinction.",

Multiple previous studies have commented on methods for identifying both germline and somatic variants. However, interpreting individual variants remains a significant challenge, relying in large part on the integration of observed variants with biological knowledge. A number of data and software resources have been developed to assist in interpreting observed variants, determining their potential clinical actionability, and augmenting them with ancillary information that can inform clinical decisions and even generate new hypotheses for exploration in the laboratory. Here, we review available variant catalogs, variant and functional annotation software and tools, and databases of clinically actionable variants that can be used in an ad hoc approach with research samples or incorporated into a data platform for interpreting and formally reporting clinical results.",

We previously tested that hypothesis using a three-dimensional (3D) statistical method to interpret the acute effects of unilateral DBS at each patients clinically optimized DBS settings and active contact. Here we report a similar analysis from a new study in which DBS parameters were standardized and DBS locations were chosen blind to clinical response. In 74 individuals with PD and STN DBS, STN contacts were selected near the dorsal and ventral border of the STN contralateral to the more affected side of the body. Participants were tested off PD medications in each of 3 conditions (ventral STN DBS, dorsal STN DBS and DBS off) for acute effects on mood, apathy, working memory, response inhibition and motor function. Voltage, frequency, and pulse width were standardized, and participants and raters were blind to condition. In a categorical analysis, both dorsal and ventral STN DBS improved mean motor function without affecting cognitive measures. Dorsal STN DBS induced greater improvement in rigidity than ventral STN DBS, whereas ventral STN DBS was more effective for improving anxiety and mood. In the 3D analysis, contact location was significant only for bradykinesia and resting tremor, with the greatest improvement occurring with DBS in dorsal STN and zona incerta. These results provide new, direct functional evidence for the anatomically-derived model of STN using the novel 3D analysis, in which motor function is most represented in dorsal STN. However, our data suggest that functional segregation between motor and non-motor areas of the STN is limited, since locations that induced improvements in motor function and mood overlapped substantially.",

Starting from the very bottom we are able to build the pieces which when hierarchically and combinatorially combined produce the emergent complex behavior that even a single celled organism can show. Euplotid is composed of a set of quantized geometric 3D building blocks and constantly evolving dockerized bioinformatic pipelines enabling a user to build and interact with the local regulatory architecture of every gene starting from DNA-interactions, chromatin accessibility, and RNA-sequencing. Reads are quantified using the latest computational tools and the results are normalized, quality-checked, and stored. The local regulatory architecture of each gene is built using a Louvain based graph partitioning algorithm parameterized by the chromatin extrusion model and CTCF-CTCF interactions. Cis-Regulatory Elements are defined using chromatin accessibility peaks which are mapped to Transcriptional Start Sites based on inclusion within the same neighborhood. Deep Neural Networks are trained in order to provide a statistical model mimicking transcription factor binding, giving the ability to identify all Transcription Factors within a given chromatin accessibility peak. By in-silico mutating and re-applying the neural network we are able to gauge the impact of a transition mutation on the binding of any transcription factor. The annotated output can be visualized in a variety of 1D, 2D, 3D and 4D ways overlaid with existing bodies of knowledge such as GWAS results or PDB structures. Once a particular CRE of interest has been identified a Base Editor mediated transition mutation can then be performed in a relevant model for further study.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/170159v15_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a55a1borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bebb0dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea5b11org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100e735_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 0.1:C_FLOATNO Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

Here, we hypothesized that non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) interferes with type II CRISPR-Cas systems. We tested this idea by studying the patterns of co-occurrence of the two systems in bacterial genomes. We found that NHEJ and type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems only co-occur once among 5563 fully sequenced prokaryotic genomes. We investigated experimentally the possible molecular interactions causing this negative association using the NHEJ pathway from Bacillus subtilis and the type II-A CRISPR-Cas systems from Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Our results suggest that the NHEJ system has no effect on type II-A CRISPR-Cas interference and adaptation. On the other hand, we provide evidence for the inhibition of NHEJ repair by the Csn2 protein from type II-A CRISPR-Cas system. Our findings give insights on the complex interactions between CRISPR- Cas systems and repair mechanisms in bacteria and contribute to explain the scattered distribution of CRISPR-Cas systems in bacterial genomes.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAnalysis toolkits for shotgun metagenomic data achieve strain-level characterization of complex microbial communities by capturing intra-species gene content variation. Yet, these tools are hampered by the extent of reference genomes that are far from covering all microbial variability, as many species are still not sequenced or have only few strains available. Binning co-abundant genes obtained from de novo assembly is a powerful reference-free technique to discover and reconstitute gene repertoire of microbial species. While current methods accurately identify species core parts, they miss many accessory genes or split them into small gene groups that remain unassociated to core clusters.\\n\\nResultsWe introduce MSPminer, a computationally efficient software tool that reconstitutes Metagenomic Species Pan-genomes (MSPs) by binning co-abundant genes across metagenomic samples. MSPminer relies on a new robust measure of proportionality coupled with an empirical classifier to group and distinguish not only species core genes but accessory genes also. Applied to a large scale metagenomic dataset, MSPminer successfully delineates in a few hours the gene repertoires of 1 661 microbial species with similar specificity and higher sensitivity than existing tools. The taxonomic annotation of MSPs reveals microorganisms hitherto unknown and brings coherence in the nomenclature of the species of the human gut microbiota. The provided MSPs can be readily used for taxonomic profiling and biomarkers discovery in human gut metagenomic samples. In addition, MSPminer can be applied on gene count tables from other ecosystems to perform similar analyses.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe binary is freely available for non-commercial users at enterome.fr/site/downloads/ Contact: florian.plaza-onate@inra.fr\\n\\nSupplementary informationAvailable in the file named Supplementary Information.pdf",

    "abstract": "Diatoms are one of the most successful and ecologically important groups of eukaryotic phytoplankton in the modern ocean. Deciphering their genomes is a key step towards better understanding of their biological innovations, evolutionary origins, and ecological underpinnings. Here, we have used 90 RNA-Seq datasets from different growth conditions combined with published expressed sequence tags and protein sequences from multiple taxa to explore the genome of the model diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and introduce 1,489 novel genes. The new annotation additionally permitted the discovery for the first time of extensive alternative splicing (AS) in diatoms, including intron retention and exon skipping which increases the diversity of transcripts to regulate gene expression in response to nutrient limitations. In addition, we have used up-to-date reference sequence libraries to dissect the taxonomic origins of diatom genomes. We show that the P. tricornutum genome is replete in lineage-specific genes, with up to 47% of the gene models present only possessing orthologues in other stramenopile groups. Finally, we have performed a comprehensive de novo annotation of repetitive elements showing novel classes of TEs such as SINE, MITE, LINE and TRIM/LARD. This work provides a solid foundation for future studies of diatom gene function, evolution and ecology.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies have revealed many loci contributing to the variation of complex traits, yet the majority of loci that contribute to the heritability of complex traits remain elusive. Large study populations with sufficient statistical power are required to detect the small effect sizes of the yet unidentified genetic variants. However, the analysis of huge cohorts, like UK Biobank, is complicated by incidental structure present when collecting such large cohorts. For instance, UK Biobank comprises 107,162 third degree or closer related participants. Traditionally, GWAS have removed related individuals because they comprised an insignificant proportion of the overall sample size, however, removing related individuals in UK Biobank would entail a substantial loss of power. Furthermore, modelling such structure using linear mixed models is computationally expensive, which requires a computational infrastructure that may not be accessible to all researchers. Here we present an atlas of genetic associations for 118 non-binary and 599 binary traits of 408,455 related and unrelated UK Biobank participants of White-British descent. Results are compiled in a publicly accessible database that allows querying genome-wide association summary results for 623,944 genotyped and HapMap2 imputed SNPs, as well downloading whole GWAS summary statistics for over 30 million imputed SNPs from the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel. Our atlas of associations (GeneATLAS, http://geneatlas.roslin.ed.ac.uk) will help researchers to query UK Biobank results in an easy way without the need to incur in high computational costs.",

However, uncoupling the impact of shape and force in tissues remains challenging. Combining stretching of Xenopus laevis tissue with a novel method of inferring relative mechanical stress, we find separate roles for cell shape in orientating division and mechanical stress in cueing division. We demonstrate that division orientation is best predicted by an axis of cell shape defined by the position of tricellular junctions (TCJs), which aligns exactly with the principal axis of local cell stress rather than the tissue-level stress. The alignment of division to cell shape requires functional cadherin and the localisation of the spindle orientation protein, LGN, to TCJs, but is not sensitive to relative cell stress magnitude. In contrast, cell proliferation rate is more directly regulated by mechanical stress, being correlated with relative isotropic stress, and can be decoupled from cell shape when myosin II is depleted.",

The substantial heritability of general cognitive function is known to be polygenic, but it has had little explication in terms of the contributing genetic variants4,5,6. Here, we combined cognitive and genetic data from the CHARGE and COGENT consortia, and UK Biobank (total N=280,360; age range = 16 to 102). We found 9,714 genome-wide significant SNPs (P<5 x 10-8) in 99 independent loci. Most showed clear evidence of functional importance. Among many novel genes associated with general cognitive function were SGCZ, ATXN1, MAPT, AUTS2, and P2RY6. Within the novel genetic loci were variants associated with neurodegenerative disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, physical and psychiatric illnesses, brain structure, and BMI. Gene-based analyses found 536 genes significantly associated with general cognitive function; many were highly expressed in the brain, and associated with neurogenesis and dendrite gene sets. Genetic association results predicted up to 4% of general cognitive function variance in independent samples. There was significant genetic overlap between general cognitive function and information processing speed, as well as many health variables including longevity.",

And, an abnormal concentration of gliotransmitters is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and Epilepsy. In this paper, a theoretical investigation of the cause of the abnormal concentration of gliotransmitters and how to achieve its control are presented through a Ca2+-signalling-based molecular communications framework. A feed-forward and feedback control technique is used to manipulate IP3 values to stabilise the concentration of Ca2+ inside the astrocytes. The theoretical analysis of the given model aims i) to stabilize the Ca2+ concentration around a particular desired level in order to prevent abnormal gliotransmitters concentration (extremely high or low concentration can result in neurodegeneration), ii) to improve the molecular communication performance that utilises Ca2+ signalling, and maintain gliotransmitters regulation remotely. It shows that the refractory periods from Ca2+ can be maintained to lower the noise propagation resulting in smaller time-slots for bit transmission, which can also improve the delay and gain performances. The proposed approach can potentially lead to novel nanomedicine solutions for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, where a combination of nanotechnology and gene therapy approaches can be used to elicit the regulated Ca2+ signalling in astrocytes, ultimately improving neuronal activity.",

Compartments are formed by nucleosomal interactions, but how TADs and loops are generated is unknown. It has been proposed that cohesin forms these structures by extruding loops until it encounters CTCF, but direct evidence for this hypothesis is missing. Here we show that cohesin suppresses compartments but is essential for TADs and loops, that CTCF defines their boundaries, and that WAPL and its PDS5 binding partners control the length of chromatin loops. In the absence of WAPL and PDS5 proteins, cohesin passes CTCF sites with increased frequency, forms extended chromatin loops, accumulates in axial chromosomal positions (vermicelli) and condenses chromosomes to an extent normally only seen in mitosis. These results show that cohesin has an essential genome-wide function in mediating long-range chromatin interactions and support the hypothesis that cohesin creates these by loop extrusion, until it is delayed by CTCF in a manner dependent on PDS5 proteins, or until it is released from DNA by WAPL.",

This allows us to obtain robust dCVR estimates both in larger regions of interest (ROIs) as well as in individual voxels. We also implement classification schemes to identify brain regions with similar dCVR characteristics. Our results reveal considerable variability of dCVR across different brain regions, as well as during different experimental conditions (normal breathing and hypercapnia), suggesting a differential response of cerebral vasculature to spontaneous CO2 fluctuations and larger, externally induced CO2 changes. The clustering results suggest that anatomically distinct brain regions exhibit different dCVR curves that do not exhibit the standard, positive valued curves that have been previously reported using measurements of global cerebral blood flow or using larger ROIs. They also revealed a consistent set of dCVR cluster shapes for resting and forcing conditions that exhibited different distribution patterns across brain voxels.",

    "abstract": "Lay SummaryAn outstanding challenge for the study of colour traits is how best to use \\\"colour spaces\\\" to represent their visual perception, particularly when asking questions of colour-difference (e.g. the (dis)similarity of males and females, mimics and models, or sister species, to a given viewer). We use simulations to show that existing methods fail to statistically and biologically estimate the separation of groups in colour space, and we suggest a flexible, robust, alternative that avoids those pitfalls.\\n\\nAbstractColour in nature presents a striking dimension of variation, though understanding its function and evolution largely depends on our ability to capture the perspective of relevant viewers. This goal has been radically advanced by the development and widespread adoption of colour spaces, which allow for the viewer-subjective estimation of colour appearance. Most studies of colour in camouflage, aposematism, sexual selection, and other signalling contexts draw on these models, with the shared analytical objective of estimating how similar (or dissimilar) colour samples are to a given viewer. We summarise popular approaches for estimating the separation of samples in colour space, and use a simulation-based approach to test their efficacy with common data structures. We show that these methods largely fail to estimate the separation of colour samples by neglecting (i) the statistical distribution and within-group variation of the data, and/or (ii) the discriminability of groups relative to the observers visual capabilities. Instead, we formalize the two questions that must be answered to establish both the statistical presence and theoretical magnitude of colour differences, and propose a two-step, permutation-based approach that achieves this goal. Unlike previous methods, our suggested approach accounts for the multidimensional nature of visual model data, and is robust against common colour-data features such as heterogeneity and outliers. We demonstrate the pitfalls of current methods and the flexibility of our suggested framework using an example from the literature, with recommendations for future inquiry.",

Here we report crystal structures of TPT bound to two different substrates, 3-phosphoglycerate and inorganic phosphate, in occluded conformations. The structures reveal that TPT adopts a 10-transmembrane drug/metabolite transporter fold. Both substrates are bound within the same central pocket, where conserved lysine, arginine, and tyrosine residues recognize the shared phosphate group. A structural comparison with the outward-open conformation of the bacterial drug/metabolite transporter suggests a rocking-type motion of helix bundles, and molecular dynamics simulations support a model in which this helix rocking is tightly coupled to the substrate binding, to ensure strict 1:1 exchange. These results reveal the unique mechanism of sugar phosphate/phosphate exchange by TPT.",

    "abstract": "HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) undergoes regulated degradation as part of feedback control of the sterol pathway. In yeast the stability of the Hmg2 isozyme of HMGR is controlled by the 20 carbon isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP): increasing levels of GGPP causes more efficient degradation by the HRD pathway, allowing feedback regulation of HMGR. The HRD pathway is a conserved quality control pathway critical for the ER-associated degradation of misfolded ER proteins. We have explored the action of GGPP in HRD-dependent Hmg2 degradation. GGPP was highly potent as a regulatory molecule in vivo, and in vitro, GGPP altered Hmg2 folding at nanomolar concentrations. These effects of GGPP were absent in a variety of stabilized or non-regulated Hmg2 mutants. Consistent with its high potency, the effects of GGPP were highly specific; other closely related molecules were ineffective in altering Hmg2 structure. In fact, two close GGPP analogues, 2F-GGPP and GGSPP were completely inactive at all concentrations tested, and GGSPP was an antagonist of GGPPs effects in vivo and in vitro. The effects of GGPP on Hmg2 structure and degradation were reversed by chemical chaperones, indicating that GGPP caused selective Hmg2 misfolding. These data indicate that GGPP functions in a manner analogous to an allosteric ligand, causing Hmg2 misfolding through interaction with a reversible, specific binding site. Consistent with this, the Hmg2 protein forms mulitmers. We propose that this \\\"allosteric misfolding,\\\" or mallostery, may be a widely used tactic of biological regulation, with potential for development of small molecule pharmaceuticals that induce selective misfolding.",

We performed time-frequency analysis of electrophysiological activity acquired during treadmill and overground walking in 22 healthy, young adults. Participants walked at their preferred speed (4.2, SD 0.4 km h-1), which was matched across both gait conditions. Event-related power, corticomuscular coherence (CMC) and inter-trial coherence (ITC) were assessed for EEG from bilateral sensorimotor cortices and EMG from the bilateral tibialis anterior (TA) muscles. Cortical power, CMC and ITC at theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequencies (4-45 Hz) increased during the double support phase of the gait cycle for both overground and treadmill walking. High beta (21-30 Hz) CMC and ITC of EMG was significantly increased during overground compared to treadmill walking, as well as EEG power in theta band (4-7 Hz). The phase spectra revealed positive time lags at alpha, beta and gamma frequencies, indicating that the EEG response preceded the EMG response. The parallel increases in power, CMC and ITC during double support suggest evoked responses at spinal and cortical populations rather than a modulation of ongoing corticospinal oscillatory interactions. The evoked responses are not consistent with the idea of synchronization of ongoing corticospinal oscillations, but instead suggest coordinated cortical and spinal inputs during the double support phase. Frequency-band dependent differences in power, CMC and ITC between overground and treadmill walking suggest differing neural control for the two gait modalities, emphasizing the task-dependent nature of neural processes during human walking.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyWe investigated cortical and spinal activity during overground and treadmill walking in healthy adults. Parallel increases in power, CMC and ITC during double support suggest evoked responses at spinal and cortical populations rather than a modulation of ongoing corticospinal oscillatory interactions. These findings identify neurophysiological mechanisms that are important for understanding cortical control of human gait in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Real-time forecasts based on mathematical models can inform critical decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Yet, epidemic forecasts are rarely evaluated during or after the event, and there is little guidance on the best metrics for assessment. Here, we propose an evaluation approach that disentangles different components of forecasting ability using metrics that separately assess the calibration, sharpness and unbiasedness of forecasts. This makes it possible to assess not just how close a forecast was to reality but also how well uncertainty has been quantified. We used this approach to analyse the performance of weekly forecasts we generated in real time in Western Area, Sierra Leone, during the 2013-16 Ebola epidemic in West Africa. We investigated a range of forecast model variants based on the model fits generated at the time with a semi-mechanistic model, and found that good probabilistic calibration was achievable at short time horizons of one or two weeks ahead but models were increasingly inaccurate at longer forecasting horizons. This suggests that forecasts may have been of good enough quality to inform decision making requiring predictions a few weeks ahead of time but not longer, reflecting the high level of uncertainty in the processes driving the trajectory of the epidemic. Comparing forecasts based on the semi-mechanistic model to simpler null models showed that the best semi-mechanistic model variant performed better than the null models with respect to probabilistic calibration, and that this would have been identified from the earliest stages of the outbreak. As forecasts become a routine part of the toolkit in public health, standards for evaluation of performance will be important for assessing quality and improving credibility of mathematical models, and for elucidating difficulties and trade-offs when aiming to make the most useful and reliable forecasts.",

    "abstract": "Stacked generalization is an ensemble method that allows researchers to combine several different prediction algorithms into one. Since its introduction in the early 1990s, the method has evolved several times into what is now known as \\\"Super Learner\\\". Super Learner uses V -fold cross-validation to build the optimal weighted combination of predictions from a library of candidate algorithms. Optimality is defined by a user-specified objective function, such as minimizing mean squared error or maximizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Although relatively simple in nature, use of the Super Learner by epidemiologists has been hampered by limitations in understanding conceptual and technical details. We work step-by-step through two examples to illustrate concepts and address common concerns.",

Interestingly, recent studies have highlighted the importance of the interplay between NF-{kappa}B signalling and the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway in colorectal epithelial cells, reporting that non-stem cells engineered to undergo high levels of Wnt and NF-{kappa}B signalling can de-differentiate, initiating tumours in mice. Here we show that BCL-3 is an important co-activator of {beta}-catenin/TCF-mediated transcriptional activity in colorectal cancer cells, increasing expression of Wnt-regulated intestinal stem cell genes. We demonstrate RNAi-mediated BCL-3 suppression reduced {beta}-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription and the expression of intestinal stem cell genes and Wnt targets LGR5 and ASCL2. Further we show that BCL-3 promotes the stem cell phenotype in colorectal cancer cells by increasing colorectal spheroid and tumoursphere formation in 3D culture conditions. Our data suggest that targeting BCL-3 may represent an exciting new approach for CRC treatment, particularly as it acts downstream of frequently mutated APC and {beta}-catenin.",

    "abstract": "DNA damage response pathways are essential for genome stability and cell survival. Specifically, the ATR kinase is activated by DNA replication stress. An early event in this activation is the recruitment and phosphorylation of RPA, a single stranded DNA binding complex composed of three subunits, RPA70,RPA32 and RPA14. We have previously shown that the LIM protein Ajuba associates with RPA, and that depletion of Ajuba leads to potent activation of ATR. In this study, we show evidence that the Ajuba-RPA interaction occurs through direct protein contact with RPA70, and that their association is cell cycle-regulated and is reduced upon DNA replication stress. We propose a model in which Ajuba negatively regulates the ATR pathway by directly interacting with RPA70, thereby preventing an inappropriate ATR activation. Our results provide a framework to understand the mechanism of regulation of ATR in human cells, which is important to prevent cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.",

In principle, transcriptome sequencing provided by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) enables unbiased discovery of gene fusions and post-analysis that informs the answer to this question. To date, such an analysis has been impossible because of performance limitations in fusion detection algorithms. By engineering a new, more precise, algorithm and statistical approaches to post-analysis of fusions called in TCGA data, we report new recurrent gene fusions, including those that could be druggable; new candidate pan-cancer oncogenes based on their profiles in fusions; and prevalent, previously overlooked, candidate oncogenic gene fusions in ovarian cancer, a disease with minimal treatment advances in recent decades. The novel and reproducible statistical algorithms and, more importantly, the biological conclusions open the door for increased attention to gene fusions as drivers of cancer and for future research into using fusions for targeted therapy.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear lamina is involved in numerous cellular functions, such as gene expression, nuclear organization, nuclear stability, and cell proliferation. The mechanism underlying the involvement of lamina is often not clear, especially in physiological contexts. Here we investigate how the farnesylated lamina proteins Lamin Dm0 and Kugelkern are linked to proliferation control of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in adult Drosophila flies by loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments. We found that ISCs mutant for Lamin Dm0 or Kugelkern proliferate, whereas overexpression of Lamin Dm0 or Kugelkern strongly suppressed proliferation. The anti-proliferative activity is, at least in part, due to suppression of Jak/Stat but not Delta/Notch signalling. Lamin Dm0 expression suppresses Jak/Stat signalling by normalization of about 50% of the Stat target genes in ISCs.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe nuclear lamina is a protein meshwork that lies beneath the inner side of the nuclear membrane and interacts with nuclear pores, chromatin and the cytoskeleton. Changes in proteins of the nuclear lamina cause a wide range of diseases which are often not well understood. It is hypothesized that impairment of stem cell function, as a result of lamina changes, might play a key role in some of those diseases. Here we use the well characterized Drosophila midgut as a system to investigate the role of lamina proteins Lamin Dm0 and Kugelkern on stem cell proliferation.",

One specific factor that may influence exposure co-variations is a shared household environment.\\n\\nOBJECTIVESTo examine the influence of shared household and partners sex in relation to the variation in 128 endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) exposures among couples.\\n\\nMETHODSIn a cohort comprising 501 couples trying for pregnancy, we measured 128 (13 chemical classes) persistent and non-persistent EDCs and estimated 1) sex-specific differences; 2) variance explained by shared household; and 3) Spearmans rank correlation coefficients (rs) for females, males, and couples exposures.\\n\\nRESULTSSex was correlated with 8 EDCs including polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) (p < 0.05). Shared household explained 43% and 41% of the total variance for PFASs and blood metals, respectively, but less than 20% for the remaining 11 EDC classes. Co-exposure patterns of the exposome were similar between females and males, with within-class rs higher for persistent and lower for non-persistent chemicals. Median rss of polybrominated compounds and urine metalloids were 0.45 and 0.09, respectively, for females (0.41 and 0.08 for males), whereas lower rss for these 2 classes were found for couples (0.21 and 0.04).\\n\\nCONCLUSIONSOverall, sex did not significantly affect EDC levels in couples. Individual, rather than shared environment, could be a major factor influencing the co-variation of 128 markers of the exposome. Correlations between exposures are lower in couples than in individual partners and have important analytical and sampling implications for epidemiological study.",

Here, we report the results of the spikefinder challenge, launched to catalyze the development of new spike inference algorithms through crowd-sourcing. We present ten of the submitted algorithms which show improved performance compared to previously evaluated methods. Interestingly, the top-performing algorithms are based on a wide range of principles from deep neural networks to generative models, yet provide highly correlated estimates of the neural activity.

Here we identify SPIN1 (Spindlin 1) as a novel binding partner of human RPL5/uL18 that is important for this pathway. SPIN1 ablation activates p53, suppresses cell growth, reduces clonogenic ability, and induces apoptosis of cancer cells by sequestering uL18 in the nucleolus, preventing it from interacting with MDM2, and thereby alleviating uL18-mediated inhibition of MDM2 ubiquitin ligase activity towards p53. SPIN1 deficiency increases ribosome-free uL18 and uL5 (human RPL11), which are required for SPIN1 depletion-induced p53 activation. Analysis of cancer genomic databases suggests that SPIN1 is highly expressed in several human cancers, and its overexpression is positively correlated with poor prognosis in cancer patients. Altogether, our findings reveal that the oncogenic property of SPIN1 is highly attributed to its negative regulation of uL18, leading to p53 inactivation.",

    "abstract": "Many eukaryotic protein-coding genes give rise to alternative mRNA isoforms with identical protein-coding capacities but which differ in the extents of their 3{acute} untranslated regions (3{acute}UTRs), due to the usage of alternative sites of pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation. By governing the presence of regulatory 3{acute}UTR sequences, this type of alternative polyadenylation (APA) can significantly influence the stability, localisation and translation efficiency of mRNA. Though a variety of molecular mechanisms for APA have been proposed, previous studies have identified a pivotal role for the multi-subunit cleavage factor I (CFIm) in this process in mammals. Here we show that, in line with previous reports, depletion of the CFIm 68 kDa subunit (CFIm68) by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene disruption in HEK293 cells leads to a shift towards the use of promoter-proximal poly(A) sites. Using these cells as the basis for a complementation assay, we show that CFIm68 lacking its arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain retains the ability to form a nuclear complex with other CFIm subunits, but selectively lacks the capacity to restore polyadenylation at promoter-distal sites. In addition, nanoparticle-mediated analysis indicates that the RS domain is extensively phosphorylated in vivo. Overall, these results suggest that the CFIm68 RS domain makes a key regulatory contribution to APA.",

    "abstract": "Freakish and rare or the tip of the iceberg? Both phrases have been used to refer to paramutation, an epigenetic drive that contravenes Mendels first law of segregation. Although its underlying mechanisms are beginning to unravel, its understanding relies only on a few examples that may involve transgenes or artificially generated epialleles. By using DNA methylation of introgression lines as an indication of past paramutation, we reveal that the paramutation-like properties of the H06 locus in hybrids of Solanum lycopersicum and a range of tomato relatives and cultivars depend on the timing of sRNA production and conform to an RNA-directed mechanism. In addition, by scanning the methylomes of tomato introgression lines for shared regions of differential methylation that are absent in the S. lycopersicum parent, we identify thousands of candidate regions for paramutation-like behaviour. The methylation patterns for a subset of these regions segregate with non Mendelian ratios, consistent with secondary paramutation-like interactions to variable extents depending on the locus. Together these results demonstrate that paramutation-like epigenetic interactions are common for natural epialleles in tomato, but vary in timing and penetrance.",

    "abstract": "Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes transmit the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, which causes the majority of fatal malaria cases worldwide. The hematophagous life style defines the mosquito reproductive biology and is exploited by P. falciparum for its own sexual reproduction and transmission. The two main phases of the mosquito reproductive cycle, pre-vitellogenic (PV) and post-blood meal (PBM) shape its capacity to transmit malaria. Transition between these phases is tightly coordinated to ensure homeostasis between mosquito tissues and successful reproduction. One layer of control is provided by microRNAs, well known regulators of blood meal digestion and egg development in Aedes mosquitoes. Here, we report a global overview of tissue-specific miRNA expression during the PV and PBM phases and identify miRNAs regulated during PV to PBM transition. The observed coordinated changes in the expression levels of a set of miRNAs in the energy-storing tissues suggest a role in the regulation of blood meal-induced metabolic changes.",

A conserved hairpin structure in the CAPS1 pre-mRNA allows an post-transcriptional adenosine-to-inosine RNA editing event to alter a genomically-encoded glutamate to a glycine codon. Functional comparisons of CAPS1 protein isoforms in primary hippocampal neurons show that elevation of edited CAPS1 isoforms facilitates presynaptic vesicle clustering and turnover. Conversely, non-edited CAPS1 isoforms slow evoked release, increase spontaneous fusion, and loosen the clustering of synaptic vesicles. Therefore, CAPS1 editing promotes organization of the vesicle pool in a way that is beneficial for evoked release, while non-edited isoforms promote more lax vesicle organization that widens distribution, attenuates evoked release and eases the control of spontaneous fusion. Overall, RNA editing of CAPS1 is a mechanism to fine tune neurotransmitter release.\\n\\nIMPACT STATEMENTPost-transcriptional RNA editing of CAPS1 is a mechanism to regulate neurotransmitter release from synaptic vesicles.",

    "abstract": "MotivationLong-read nanopore sequencing technology is of particular significance for taxonomic identification at or below the species level. For many environmental samples, the total extractable DNA is far below the current input requirements of nanopore sequencing, preventing \\\"sample to sequence\\\" metagenomics from low-biomass or recalcitrant samples.\\n\\nResultsHere we address this problem by employing carrier sequencing, a method to sequence low-input DNA by preparing the target DNA with a genomic carrier to achieve ideal library preparation and sequencing stoichiometry without amplification. We then use CarrierSeq, a sequence analysis workflow to identify the low-input target reads from the genomic carrier. We tested CarrierSeq experimentally by sequencing from a combination of 0.2 ng Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633 DNA in a background of 1 g Enterobacteria phage {lambda} DNA. After filtering of carrier, low quality, and low complexity reads, we detected target reads (B. subtilis), contamination reads, and \\\"high quality noise reads\\\" (HQNRs) not mapping to the carrier, target or known lab contaminants. These reads appear to be artifacts of the nanopore sequencing process as they are associated with specific channels (pores). By treating reads as a Poisson arrival process, we implement a statistical test to reject data from channels dominated by HQNRs while retaining target reads.\\n\\nAvailabilityCarrierSeq is an open-source bash script with supporting python scripts which leverage a variety of bioinformatics software packages on macOS and Ubuntu.

    "abstract": "Although the number of RNA-Seq datasets deposited publicly has increased over the past few years, incomplete annotation of the associated metadata limits their potential use. Because of the importance of RNA splicing in diseases and biological processes, we constructed a database called SFMetaDB by curating datasets related with RNA splicing factors. Our effort focused on the RNA-Seq datasets in which splicing factors were knocked-down, knocked-out or over-expressed, leading to 75 datasets corresponding to 56 splicing factors. These datasets can be used in differential alternative splicing analysis for the identification of the potential targets of these splicing factors and other functional studies. Surprisingly, only [~]15% of all the splicing factors have been studied by loss- or gain-of-function experiments using RNA-Seq. In particular, splicing factors with domains from a few dominant Pfam domain families have not been studied. This suggests a significant gap that needs to be addressed to fully elucidate the splicing regulatory landscape. Indeed, there are already mouse models available for [~]20 of the unstudied splicing factors, and it can be a fruitful research direction to study these splicing factors in vitro and in vivo using RNA-Seq.\\n\\nDatabase URLhttp://sfmetadb.ece.tamu.edu/",

    "abstract": "New World monkeys (parvorder Platyrrhini) are one of the most diverse groups of primates, occupying today a wide range of ecosystems in the American tropics and exhibiting large variations in ecology, morphology, and behavior. Although the relationships among the almost 200 living species are relatively well understood, we lack robust estimates of the timing of origin, the ancestral morphology, and the evolution of the distribution of the clade. Here we integrate paleontological and molecular evidence to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of extinct and extant platyrrhines. We develop an analytical framework to infer ancestral states, the evolution of body mass, and changes in latitudinal ranges through time. Our results show that extant platyrrhines originated some 5-10 million years earlier than previously assumed, likely dating back to the Middle Eocene ([~] 43 million years ago, Ma). The estimated ancestral platyrrhine was strikingly small - weighing [~] 0.4 kg, as compared to the largest modern species over 10 kg - matching the size of their presumed Eocene North African ancestors. Small-sized callitrichines (marmosets and tamarins) retained a small body mass throughout their evolutionary history, thus challenging the hypothesis of phyletic dwarfism as an explanation to their adaptive traits. In contrast, a rapid change in body mass range took place as the three families diverged between the Late Oligocene and the Early Miocene. That period also marks a peak in diversity of fossil platyrrhines and is associated with their widest latitudinal range, expanding as far to the South as Patagonia. This geographic expansion is temporally coincident with a significant increase in platyrrhine population size inferred from genomic data, and with warm and humid climatic conditions linked to the Miocene Climatic Optimum and the lower elevation of the Andes. These results unveil the early evolution of an iconic group of monkeys and showcase the advantages of integrating fossil and molecular data for estimating evolutionary rates and trends.",

    "abstract": "Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are likely driven by aberrant immune responses directed against the resident microbiota. Although IBD is commonly associated with a dysbiotic microbiota enriched in putative pathobionts, the etiological agents of IBD remain unknown. Using a pathobiont-induced intestinal inflammation model and a defined bacterial community, we provide new insights into the immune-microbiota interactions during disease. In our model system, the pathobiont Helicobacter bilis instigates disease following sub-pathological dextran sulfate sodium treatment. We show that H. bilis causes mild inflammation in mono-associated mice, but severe disease in the presence of a microbiota, demonstrating synergy between the pathobiont and microbiota in exacerbating pathology. Remarkably, inflammation depends on the presence of H. bilis, but is marked by a predominant Th17 response against specific members of the microbiota and not the pathobiont, even upon the removal of the most immune-dominant taxa. Neither increases in pathobiont burden nor unique changes in immune-targeted microbiota member abundances are observed during disease. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that a pathobiont instigates inflammation without being the primary target of a Th17 response or by altering the microbiota community structure. Moreover, our findings point toward monitoring pathobiont-induced changes in microbiota immune targeting as a new concept in IBD diagnotics.",

However, the world deals seriously with these viruses when the viruses infected either human or animals especially if the infection were confirmed that classified as zoonotic (Lal et al. 2005). There are many viruses distribution in many countries around the world including Ebolavirus, Marburgvirus, SARS and MERS coronaviruses, Hendra, Nipah and arenavirus haemorrhagic fever viruses were categorized as zoonotic RNA viruses that cause epidemic in some regions such as African countries (Fichet-Calvet & Rogers 2009) (Ehichioya et al. 2010). Consequently, structural bioinformatics of virus protein like L polymerase of arenaviruses was used for monitor the future outbreak that could be happens by new species of viruses. At this research, significant similarities with hemorrhagic fever viruses including arenaviruses were found on GenBank database. Translated blast (tBLASTn) available on https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi was used for searching translated nucleotide databases using a protein query of arenavirus L polymerase (McGinnis & Madden 2004). At this research, the new and archival metazoan transcriptome sequence data of the new TSA species that available on NCBI was used for identification with arenaviruses genes. Therefore, structure bioinformatics was utilized for better understanding and predication the evolution and natural history of the pools of uncharacterized virus on Genbank database that have led to emerging haemorrhagic fever in near future around the world.",

    "abstract": "Aging is accompanied by unisensory decline; but to compensate for this, two complementary strategies are potentially relied upon increasingly: first, older adults integrate more information from different sensory organs. Second, according to predictive coding (PC) we form  templates (internal models or  priors) of the environment through our experiences. It is through increased life experience that older adults may rely more on these templates compared to younger adults. Multisensory integration and predictive coding would be effective strategies for the perception of near-threshold stimuli, but they come at the cost of integrating irrelevant information. Their role can be studied in multisensory illusions because these require the integration of different sensory information, as well as an internal model of the world that can take precedence over sensory input. Here, we elicited a classic multisensory illusion, the sound-induced flash illusion, in younger (mean: 27 yrs) and older (mean: 67 yrs) adult participants while recording the magnetoencephalogram. Older adults perceived more illusions than younger adults. Older adults had increased pre-stimulus beta({beta})-band activity compared to younger adults as predicted by microcircuit theories of predictive coding, which suggest priors and predictions are linked to {beta}-band activity. In line with our hypothesis, transfer entropy analysis and dynamic causal models of pre-stimulus MEG data revealed a stronger illusion-related modulation of cross-modal connectivity from auditory to visual cortices in older compared to younger adults. We interpret this as the neural correlate of increased reliance on a cross-modal predictive template in older adults that is leading to the illusory percept.",

Further, single unit recording in the MeA uncovered significant changes in the sensory representation of conspecific cues in the absence of oxytocin signaling. Finally, acute manipulation of oxytocin signaling in adults is sufficient to alter social interaction preferences in males as well as responses of MeA neurons to chemosensory cues. These results uncover the critical role of oxytocin signaling in a molecularly defined neuronal population in order to modulate the behavioral and physiological responses of male mice to females on a moment-to-moment basis.",

We investigated the neurobiological consequences of escalation of prescription opioid use using extended access to intravenous oxycodone self-administration in rats.\\n\\nMethodsMale Wistar rats acquired oxycodone self-administration (0.15 mg/kg/infusion, i.v.) in 1h or 12h access sessions. Electrophysiological and immunohistochemical studies investigated the effects of oxycodone self-administration on kappa opioid receptor (KOR) regulation of GABAergic signaling and dynorphin expression in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA).\\n\\nResultsRats given 12h access to oxycodone for 5 sessions/week (LgA) escalated their responding more than rats given 1h oxycodone (ShA) or 12h saline access. Slowed escalation of responding was found in rats given 12h access for 7 sessions/week (LgA-7day) or rats pretreated with the KOR antagonist nor-binaltorphamine dihydrochloride (norBNI) before LgA (norBNI+LgA). The KOR agonist U-50488 decreased GABA release in CeA neurons of all groups except LgA. norBNI increased GABA release in control group neurons, suggesting tonic KOR activity. This activity was abolished in ShA, norBNI+LgA, and LgA-7day rat neurons, consistent with decreased CeA dynorphin immunoreactivity observed in LgA-7day rats. However, norBNI effects were reversed (decreased CeA GABA release) in LgA rat neurons.\\n\\nConclusionsThe experience of intermittent extended withdrawal periods accelerates the escalation of oxycodone self-administration and causes greater dysregulation of CeA KOR-mediated GABAergic signaling. A KOR agonist/antagonist switch effect seen with other drugs of abuse was absent, which suggests that oxycodone-induced neuroadaptations may be distinct from those resulting from other drugs of abuse.",

    "abstract": "PREPRINT NOTESThis paper was submitted for publication the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology in August of 2003. The paper was rejected roughly a year later due to scope and collection issues. I revisited the paper in 2007 with an eye to updating and resubmitting with additional data but the project was triaged from the publication pipeline due to the work involved relative to other projects more relevant to my research interests at the time. The current preprint paper contains updated references on occipital bone sexual dimorphism--all limited to the condylar region rather than the full suite of variation in the region.\\n\\nI am posting this to the preprint server to contribute the findings to the larger scientific community in the hopes that I might have time to revisit the paper as a student project. A more rigorous study would need to expand the sample either to a study collection that has remains with known sex (either verified via molecular sexing techniques or using a modern study collection) or additional comparative collections from hunter-gatherer populations. If a student is interested in taking up the topic and assuming lead authorship on a co-authored paper, Id be happy to collaborate and see this piece through the publication pipeline.\\n\\nABSTRACTThis paper presents the results of a comprehensive study of sexual dimorphism in the human occipital region of the skull using the remains of 39 prehistoric adults from the prehistoric Windover (6,000-8,000 BP). The results of a discriminant analysis classified 64% of the individuals correctly (using osteologically identified sex). Sexual dimorphism in this population may not be prevalent due to environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "Studies of innate glial cell responses for progressive human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1) infection are hindered by the availability of relevant small-animal models. To overcome this hindrance, a mouse model reconstituted with humanized brain and immune systems was created. Newborn NOD/SCID/IL2R{gamma}c-/- mice of both sexes were transplanted with human neuroglial progenitors (NPC) and hematopoietic stem cells. Intraventricular injection of NPC yielded an anatomical symmetrical glia (human astrocyte and oligodendrocyte) repopulation of the mouse brain. The human glia were observed in periventricular areas, white matter tracts, the olfactory bulb and brain stem. HIV-1 infection of these dual humanized mice led to meningeal and perivascular human leukocyte infiltration into brain. The species-specific viral-neuroimmune interactions in the infected animals were identified by deep RNA sequencing. In the corpus callosum and hippocampus overlapping human-specific transcriptional alterations were seen for interferon type 1 and 2 signaling pathways (STAT1, 2, IRF9, ISG15, IFI6) and a range of host antiviral responses (MX1, OAS1, RSAD2, BST2, SAMHD1) in infected animals. Glial cytoskeleton reorganization, oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin ensheathment (MBP, MOBP, PLP1, MAG and ZNF488) were downregulated. The data sets were confirmed by real-time PCR. The viral defense signaling patterns observed in these mice parallels the neuroimmune communication networks present in the HIV-1 infected human brain. In this manner, the new mouse model can facilitate discovery of therapeutics, viral eradication targets for virus induced nervous system diseases, and simplify HIVCure research approaches.\\n\\nSummary StatementWe created mice with both a humanized brain and an immune system. The animals were used to investigate glial responses to HIV-1 infection. At a transcriptional level we defined the interactions between human glia and immune cells in the presence of the systemic HIV-1 infection. Noticeably, altered transcriptional changes were human specific. At five weeks after viral infection humanized mouse brain displayed potent interferon-mediated antiviral innate immune responses and alteration of neuronal progenitors differentiation and myelination. This model can be used to tests both diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for cure HIV-associated brain impairment.",

    "abstract": "Microbes exist in complex communities and can engage in social interactions ranging from cooperation to warfare. Biofilms are structured, cooperative microbial communities; they are pervasive and ancient, representing the first fossilized life. Like all cooperative communities, biofilms are susceptible to invasion by selfish individuals who benefit from cooperation, but do not contribute. The ubiquity of biofilms therefore poses a challenge to evolutionary theory. One hypothesis for biofilm stability is spatial structure: patches of related cooperative cells are able to outcompete unrelated cells. These dynamics have been explored computationally and in bacterial systems; however, their relevance to eukaryotic microbes remains an open question. Here, we investigate the interactions of environmental yeast isolates with different social phenotypes. Our results show that biofilm strains spatially exclude non-biofilm strains, and that biofilm spatial structure confers a consistent and robust fitness advantage in direct competition. We also find that biofilms protect against killer toxin, a warfare phenotype. During biofilm formation, cells are susceptible to toxin from nearby competitors; however, increased spatial use by biofilms provides an escape from toxin-producers. Our results suggest that yeast biofilms represent a competitive strategy, and that principles elucidated for the evolution and stability of bacterial biofilms may apply to eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Crosses between Drosophila melanogaster females and Drosophila simulans males produce hybrid sons that die at the larval stage. This hybrid lethality is suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in the D. melanogaster Hybrid male rescue (Hmr) or in the D. simulans Lethal hybrid rescue (Lhr) genes. Previous studies have shown that Hmr and Lhr interact with heterochromatin proteins and suppress expression of transposable elements within D. melanogaster. It also has been proposed that Hmr and Lhr function at the centromere. We examined mitotic divisions in larval brains from Hmr and Lhr single mutants and Hmr; Lhr double mutants in D. melanogaster. In none of the mutants did we observe defects in metaphase chromosome alignment or hyperploid cells, which are hallmarks of centromere or kinetochore dysfunction. In addition, we found that Hmr-HA and Lhr-HA do not localize to centromeres either during interphase or mitotic division. However, all mutants displayed anaphase bridges and chromosome aberrations resulting from the breakage of these bridges, predominantly at the euchromatin-heterochromatin junction. The few dividing cells present in hybrid males showed irregularly condensed chromosomes with fuzzy and often closely apposed sister chromatids. Despite this defect in condensation, chromosomes in hybrids managed to align on the metaphase plate and undergo anaphase. We conclude that there is no evidence for a centromeric function of Hmr and Lhr within D. melanogaster nor for a centromere defect causing hybrid lethality. Instead we find that Hmr and Lhr are required in D. melanogaster for detachment of sister chromatids during anaphase.",

    "abstract": "Women with X chromosome aneuploidy such as 45,X (Turner syndrome) or 47,XXX (Triple X syndrome) present with characteristics including differences in stature, increased cardiovascular disease risk and primary ovarian insufficiency. Many women with X chromosome aneuploidy undergo lifetime clinical monitoring for possible complications. However, ascertainment of cases in the clinic may mean that the phenotypic penetrance is overestimated. Studies of prenatally ascertained X chromosome aneuploidy cases have limited follow-up data and so the long-term consequences into adulthood are often not reported. We aimed to characterise the prevalence and phenotypic consequences of X chromosome aneuploidy in a large population of women over 40 years of age. We detected 30 women with 45,X, 186 with mosaic 45,X/46,XX and 110 with 47,XXX among 244,848 UK Biobank women, using SNP array data. The prevalence of non-mosaic 45,X (1/8,162) and 47,XXX (1/2,226) was lower than expected, but was higher for mosaic 45,X/46,XX (1/1,316). The characteristics of women with 45,X were consistent with the characteristics of a clinically recognised Turner syndrome phenotype, including a 17.2cm shorter stature (SD = 5.72cm; P = 1.5 x 10-53) and 16/30 did not report an age at menarche. The phenotype of women with 47,XXX included taller stature (5.3cm; SD = 5.52cm; P = 5.8 x 10-20), earlier menopause age (5.12 years; SD = 5.1 years; P = 1.2 x 10-14) and a lower fluid intelligence score (24%; SD = 29.7%; P = 3.7 x 10-8). In contrast, the characteristics of women with mosaic 45,X/46,XX were much less pronounced than expected. Women with mosaic 45,X/46,XX were less short, had a normal reproductive lifespan and birth rate, and no reported cardiovascular complications. In conclusion, the availability of data from 244,848 women allowed us to assess the phenotypic penetrance of traits associated with X chromosome aneuploidy in an adult population setting. Our results suggest that the clinical management of women with 45,X/46,XX mosaicism should be minimal, particularly those identified incidentally.\\n\\nFundingNone",

    "abstract": "Non-additive genetic effects can be effectively exploited in control-pollinated families with the availability of genome-wide markers. We used 41,304 SNP markers and compared pedigree vs. marker-based genetic models by analysing height, diameter, basic density and pulp yield for 338 Eucalyptus urophylla x E.grandis control-pollinated families represented by 949 informative individuals. We evaluated models accounting for additive, dominance, and first-order epistatic interactions (additive by additive, dominance by dominance, and additive by dominance). We showed that the models can capture a large proportion of the genetic variance from dominance and epistasis for growth traits as those components are typically not independent. We also show that we could partition genetic variances more precisely when using relationship matrices derived from markers compared to using only pedigree information. In addition, phenotypic prediction accuracies were only slightly increased by including dominance effects for growth traits since estimates of non-additive variances yielded rather high standard errors. This novel result improves our current understanding of the architecture of quantitative traits and recommends accounting for dominance variance when developing genomic selection strategies in hybrid Eucalyptus.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional ketosis is induced by high fat/low carbohydrate dietary regimens, which produce high levels of circulating ketone bodies, shifting metabolism away from glucose utilization. While ketogenic diets (KD) were initially introduced to suppress seizures, they are garnering attention for their potential to treat a myriad of neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders that are associated with advanced age. The feasibility and physiological impact of implementing a long-term KD in old animals, however, has not been systematically examined. In this study, young and aged rats consumed a calorically- and nutritionally-matched KD or control diet for 12 weeks. All KD-fed rats maintained higher levels of {beta}-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and lower levels of glucose relative to controls. However, it took the aged rats longer to reach asymptotic levels of BHB compared to young animals. Moreover, KD-fed rats had significantly less visceral white and brown adipose tissue than controls without a loss of lean mass. Interestingly, the KD lead to significant alterations in protein levels of hippocampal transporters for monocarboxylates, glucose and vesicular glutamate and GABA. Most notably, the age-related decline in vesicular glutamate transporter expression was reversed by the KD. These data demonstrate the feasibility and potential benefits of KDs for treating age-associated neural dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Polyploidy is a recurrent feature of eukaryotic evolution and has been linked to increases in complexity, adaptive radiation and speciation. Within angiosperms, such events occur repeatedly in many plant lineages. We investigated the role of duplicated genes in the regulation of flowering in Brassica napus. This relatively young allotetraploid represents a snapshot of evolution and artificial selection in progress. In line with the gene balance hypothesis, we find preferential retention of expressed flowering time genes relative to the whole genome. Furthermore, gene expression dynamics across development reveal diverged regulation of many flowering time gene copies. This finding supports the concept of responsive backup circuits being key for the retention of duplicated genes. A case study of BnaTFL1 reveals differences in cis-regulatory elements downstream of these genes that could explain this divergence. Such differences in the regulatory dynamics of duplicated genes highlight the challenges for translating gene networks from model to more complex polyploid crop species.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVEHuman obesity is a complex metabolic disorder disproportionately affecting people of lower socioeconomic strata, and ethnic minorities, especially African Americans and Hispanics. Although genetic predisposition and a positive energy balance are implicated in obesity, these factors alone do not account for the excess prevalence of obesity in lower socioeconomic populations. Therefore, environmental factors, including exposure to pesticides, heavy metals, and other contaminants, are agents widely suspected to have obesogenic activity, and they also are spatially correlated with lower socioeconomic status. Our study investigates the causal relationship between exposure to the heavy metal, cadmium (Cd), and obesity in a cohort of children and a zebrafish model of adipogenesis.\\n\\nDESIGNAn extensive collection of first trimester maternal blood samples obtained as part of the Newborn Epigenetics Study (NEST) were analyzed for the presence Cd, and these results were cross analyzed with the weight-gain trajectory of the children through age five years. Next, the role of Cd as a potential obesogen was analyzed in an in vivo zebrafish model.\\n\\nRESULTSOur analysis indicates that the presence of Cd in maternal blood during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of juvenile obesity in the offspring, independent of other variables, including lead (Pb) and smoking status. Our results are recapitulated in a zebrafish model, in which exposure to Cd at levels approximating those observed in the NEST study is associated with increased adiposity.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONOur findings identify Cd as potential human obesogen. Moreover, these observations are recapitulated in a zebrafish model, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms may be evolutionarily conserved, and that zebrafish may be a valuable model for uncovering pathways leading to Cd-mediated obesity in human populations.",
