    "abstract": "We propose and validate a clear strategy to efficiently and comprehensively characterize neurobehavioral deficits in the Ts65Dn mouse model of Down syndrome. This novel approach uses neurocognitive theory to design and select behavioral tasks that test specific hypotheses concerning the results of Down syndrome. In this manuscript we model in Ts65Dn mice the Arizona Cognitive Task Battery used to study human populations with Down syndrome. We observed specific deficits for spatial memory, impaired long-term memory for visual objects, acquisition and reversal of motor responses, reduced motor dexterity, and impaired adaptive function as measured by nesting and anxiety tasks. The Ts65Dn mice showed intact temporal ordering, novelty detection, and visual object recognition with short delays. These results phenocopy the performance of participants with Down syndrome on the Arizona Cognitive Task Battery. This approach extends the utility of mouse models of Down syndrome by integrating the expertise of clinical neurology and cognitive neuroscience into the mouse behavioral laboratory. Further, by directly emphasizing the reciprocal translation of research between human disease states and the associated mouse models, we demonstrate that it is possible for both groups to mutually inform each others research to more efficiently generate hypotheses and elucidate treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "The mere existence of speciation and extinction make macro-evolutionary processes possible. Speciation and extinction introduce discontinuities in the microevolutionary change within lineages by initiating, disrupting, and terminating the continuity of species lineages. Within a clade, speciation and extinction become potent means of macroevolution in and of themselves. This process, termed species selection, is a macroevolutionary analogue of natural selection, with species playing an analogous part akin to that played by organisms in microevolution. That said, it has proven difficult to think about levels of selection. The concept of species sorting was introduced to help our thinking on this issue by identifying two aspects inherent in hierarchical systems can confuse our attempts to understand them: uncertainty in the level that selection acts and uncertainty about if the pattern of selection is in fact caused at all. Thanks to insights from evolutionary transitions in individuality, we now know more about how to identify the level of selection and how to parse the causal structure in hierarchical evolutionary circumstances. We know that if the fitness of organisms causes the fitness of more inclusive species then they must covary. However, there is no evidence of such a covariance between fitnesses at these two levels. This covariance is just not observed; neither between cells and organisms nor between organisms and species. Rather, speciation and extinction rates appear to be completely divorced from organismal fitness. With this insight, the concept of species sorting shrinks so that it only covers the two processes of species selection and drift. I argue that we are better off focusing on understanding the processes of species selection and drift and that there is therefore no further need for the concept of species sorting.",

    "abstract": "The multispecies network coalescent (MSNC) is a stochastic process that captures how gene trees grow within the branches of a phylogenetic network. Coupling the MSNC with a stochastic mutational process that operates along the branches of the gene trees gives rise to a generative model of how multiple loci from within and across species evolve in the presence of both incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and reticulation (e.g., hybridization). We report on a Bayesian method for sampling the parameters of this generative model, including the species phylogeny, gene trees, divergence times, and population sizes, from DNA sequences of multiple independent loci. We demonstrate the utility of our method by analyzing simulated data and reanalyzing three biological data sets. Our results demonstrate the significance of not only co-estimating species phylogenies and gene trees, but also accounting for reticulation and ILS simultaneously. In particular, we show that when gene flow occurs, our method accurately estimates the evolutionary histories, coalescence times, and divergence times. Tree inference methods, on the other hand, underestimate divergence times and overestimate coalescence times when the evolutionary history is reticulate. While the MSNC corresponds to an abstract model of \\\"intermixture,\\\" we study the performance of the model and method on simulated data generated under a gene flow model. We show that the method accurately infers the most recent time at which gene flow occurs. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the new method to a 106-locus yeast data set.

    "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder affects about 350 million people worldwide, and about one-third of the patients are considered treatment-resistant. Furthermore, available antidepressants take usually two weeks for the onset of their antidepressant effect. Recent open label trials show that psychedelics, such as ayahuasca and psilocybin, hold promise as fast-onset antidepressants. Although promising, these studies were not controlled for the placebo effect. To address this issue, and to further test the antidepressant effects of ayahuasca, we conducted a parallel arm, double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial, in patients with treatment-resistant major depression. Thirty-five patients with treatment-resistant major depression received a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. We measured as primary outcome the change in the Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D) seven days after the dosing session, and as secondary outcomes the changes in Montgomery-[A]sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and response rates at one day (D1), two days (D2) and seven days (D7) after dosing, and remission rates at D7. This study is registered with http://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02914769). We observed robust evidence of rapid antidepressant effects of a single dosing session with ayahuasca when compared to placebo. HAM-D scores at D7 were significantly lower in patients treated with ayahuasca than in those treated with placebo (p=0{middle dot}019; Cohens d=0{middle dot}98). MADRS scores were significantly reduced in the ayahuasca group compared to the placebo group at all endpoints (at D1 and D2, p=0{middle dot}04; at D7, p<0{middle dot}0001). Between-group effect sizes increased from D1 to D7 (D1: Cohens d=0{middle dot}84; D2: Cohens d=0{middle dot}84; D7: Cohens d=1{middle dot}49). Response rates were high for both groups at D1 and D2, and were significantly higher in the ayahuasca group only at D7 (64% vs. 27%; OR = 4{middle dot}95; p = 0{middle dot}04; NNT = 2{middle dot}66). Remission rate was not significantly different between groups. Our study provides new evidence of rapid antidepressant effects of ayahuasca for treatment-resistant major depression.",

    "abstract": "Biogenesis of the outer membrane (OM) in Gram-negative bacteria, which is essential for viability, requires the coordinated transport and assembly of proteins and lipids, including lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and phospholipids (PLs), into the membrane. While pathways for LPS and OM protein assembly are well-studied, how PLs are transported to and from the OM is not clear. Mechanisms that ensure OM stability and homeostasis are also unknown. The trans-envelope Tol-Pal complex, whose physiological role has remained elusive, is important for OM stability. Here, we establish that the Tol-Pal complex is required for PL transport and OM lipid homeostasis in Escherichia coli. Cells lacking the complex exhibit defects in lipid asymmetry and accumulate excess phospholipids (PLs) in the OM. This imbalance in OM lipids is due to defective retrograde PL transport in the absence of a functional Tol-Pal complex. Thus, cells ensure the assembly of a stable OM by maintaining an excess flux of PLs to the OM only to return the surplus to the inner membrane. Our findings also provide insights into the mechanism by which the Tol-Pal complex may promote OM invagination during cell division.",

Exceptions to this universal plastid genome architecture are very few and include the dinoflagellates where genes are located on DNA minicircles. Here we report on the highly deviant chloroplast genome of Cladophorales green algae, which is entirely fragmented into hairpin plasmids. Short and long read high-throughput sequencing of DNA and RNA demonstrated that the chloroplast genes of Boodlea composita are encoded on 1-7 kb DNA contigs with an exceptionally high GC-content, each containing a long inverted repeat with one or two protein-coding genes and conserved non-coding regions putatively involved in replication and/or expression. We propose that these contigs correspond to linear single-stranded DNA molecules that fold onto themselves to form hairpin plasmids. The Boodlea chloroplast genes are highly divergent from their corresponding orthologs. The origin of this highly deviant chloroplast genome likely occurred before the emergence of the Cladophorales, and coincided with an elevated transfer of chloroplast genes to the nucleus. A chloroplast genome that is composed only of linear DNA molecules is unprecedented among eukaryotes and highlights unexpected variation in the plastid genome architecture.",

Over the last century, the upward trend in HA-head glycosylation indicates glycan addition can increase fitness, but its role in viral evolution remains unclear. Here, we report glycan evolution follows a clock-like rhythm, pacing the timeline, trajectory, and replacement of HA. Following pandemic introduction, glycans are added to HA at 4- to 6-year intervals, until a functional glycan limit is reached, after which, at 9- to 12-year intervals, glycans are either swapped between different sites, or the HA is replaced by a novel pandemic virus. Using this, we predicted the appearance of the newest glycan on pH1N1 HA. Phylogeographic reconstruction suggests these highly fit strains originated in the Middle East, before rapidly replacing all strains globally. Going forward, we can use this simple algorithm to forecast future glycan evolution and identify seasons with higher pandemic potential.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, cells undertake a series of fate decisions to form a complete organism comprised of various cell types, epitomising a branching process. A striking example of branching occurs in humans around the time of implantation, when primordial germ cells (PGCs), precursors of sperm and eggs, and somatic lineages are specified. Due to inaccessibility of human embryos at this stage of development, understanding the mechanisms of PGC specification remains difficult. The integrative modelling of single cell transcriptomics data from embryos and appropriate in vitro models should prove to be a useful resource for investigating this system, provided that the cells can be suitably ordered over a developmental axis. Unfortunately, most methods for inferring cell ordering were not designed with structured (time series) data in mind. Although some probabilistic approaches address these limitations by incorporating prior information about the developmental stage (capture time) of the cell, they do not allow the ordering of cells over processes with more than one terminal cell fate. To investigate the mechanisms of PGC specification, we develop a probabilistic pseudotime approach, branch-recombinant Gaussian process latent variable models (B-RGPLVMs), that use an explicit model of transcriptional branching in individual marker genes, allowing the ordering of cells over developmental trajectories with arbitrary numbers of branches. We use first demonstrate the advantage of our approach over existing pseudotime algorithms and subsequently use it to investigate early human development, as primordial germ cells (PGCs) and somatic cells diverge. We identify known master regulators of human PGCs, and predict roles for a variety of signalling pathways, transcription factors, and epigenetic modifiers. By concentrating on the earliest branched signalling events, we identified an antagonistic role for FGF receptor (FGFR) signalling pathway in the acquisition of competence for human PGC fate, and identify putative roles for PRC1 and PRC2 in PGC specification. We experimentally validate our predictions using pharmacological blocking of FGFR or its downstream effectors (MEK, PI3K and JAK), and demonstrate enhanced competency for PGC fate in vitro, whilst small molecule inhibition of the enzymatic component of PRC1/PRC2 reveals reduced capacity of cells to form PGCs in vitro. Thus, B-RGPLVMs represent a powerful and flexible data-driven approach for dissecting the temporal dynamics of cell fate decisions, providing unique insights into the mechanisms of early embryogenesis.

    "abstract": "PurposeThe majority of cancer patients receive treatments that are minimally informed by omics data. We propose a precision medicine computational framework (PANOPLY: Precision cancer genomic report: single sample inventory) to identify and prioritize drug targets and cancer therapy regimens.\\n\\nMethodsThe PANOPLY approach integrates clinical data with germline and somatic features obtained from multi-omics platforms, and apply machine learning, and network analysis approaches in the context of the individual patient and matched controls. The PANOPLY workflow employs four steps (i) selection of matched controls to the case of interest (ii) identification of case-specific genomic events (iii) identification of suitable drugs using the driver-gene network and random forest analyses and (iv) provide an integrated multi-omics case report of the patient with prioritization of anti-cancer drugs.\\n\\nResultsThe PANOPLY workflow can be executed on a stand-alone virtual machine and is also available for download as an R package. We applied the method to an institutional breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy study which collected clinical and genomic data as well as patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) to investigate the prioritization offered by PANOPLY. In a chemotherapy-resistant PDX model, we found that that the prioritized drug, olaparib, was more effective than placebo in treating the tumor (P < 0.05). We also applied PANOPLY to in-house and publicly accessible multi-omics tumor datasets with therapeutic response or survival data available.\\n\\nConclusionPANOPLY shows promise as a means to prioritize drugs based on clinical and multi-omics data for an individual cancer patient. Additional studies are needed to confirm this approach.",

The structural basis for positive selection has long been debated. Here, using mice expressing one of two different T cell receptor {beta} chains and various MHC alleles, we show that positive selection-induced MHC bias of T cell receptors is affected both by the germline encoded elements of the T cell receptor  and {beta} chain and, surprisingly, dramatically affected by the non germ line encoded CDR3 of the T cell receptor  chain. Thus, in addition to determining specificity for antigen, the non germline encoded elements of T cell receptors may help the proteins cope with the extremely polymorphic nature of major histocompatibility complex products within the species.",

Terminal/persiynaptic Schwann cells (TPSCs) are a perisynaptic glial cell at the neuromuscular junction. Here, we provide genetic evidence that neural activity-induced intracellular calcium accumulation in neonatal TPSCs is mediated exclusively by P2Y1 receptors. In P2ry1 mutant mice lacking these responses, postsynaptic, rather than presynaptic, function was altered in response to nerve stimulation. This impairment was correlated with a greater susceptibility to activity-induced muscle fatigue. Interestingly, fatigue in P2ry1 mutants was exacerbated by exposure to high potassium to a greater degree than in control mice. High potassium itself increased cytosolic levels of calcium in TPSCs, a response which was also reduced P2ry1 mutants. These results suggest that activity-induced calcium responses in perisynaptic glia at the NMJ regulate postsynaptic function and muscle fatigue by influencing the levels of perisynaptic potassium.",

We tested the accessibility of thermodynamic phenotypic diversity within limited positional changes using 29=512 mutants of a terpene synthase (TPS), Tobacco 5-epi-Aristolchene synthase. First, we measured the thermal unfolding curves of each mutant and found that mutations shifted the Tms both higher and lower, including a cohort of mutants that failed to fold. The low correlation coefficient between the Tms of these mutants and the proportions of each terpene product output by the enzymes revealed that thermostability and product output are independent traits. Maximum Noise Entropy analyses were used to analyze the impact of the 9 mutational positions on thermostability, revealing that three of these positions were mainly responsible for the trait of increased Tm. These positions form a functional network as measured by the nonlinearity of their combined effects on thermostability. Unexpectedly, the strongly destabilizing positions combine nonlinearly to ameliorate each others deleterious effects resulting in a synergistic dampening. Taken together, our study shows the high potential for specialized metabolic enzyme engineering but also reveals a complex interconnected system of amino acids that will continue to evade perfect predictability.",

Many of these candidate phyla are composed of microorganisms with minimalistic, streamlined genomes lacking some core metabolic pathways, which may contribute to their resistance to growth in pure culture. Here we analyzed single-cell genomes and metagenome bins to show that the \\\"Candidate phylum SPAM\\\" represents an interesting exception, by having large genomes (6-8 Mbps), high GC content (66%-71%), and the potential for a versatile, mixotrophic metabolism. We also observed an unusually high genomic heterogeneity among individual SPAM cells in the studied samples. These features may have contributed to the limited recovery of sequences of this candidate phylum in prior metagenomic studies. Based on these observations, we propose renaming SPAM to \\\"Candidate phylum Solagigasbacteria\\\". Current evidence suggests that Solagigasbacteria are distributed globally in diverse terrestrial ecosystems, including soils, the rhizosphere, volcanic mud, oil wells, aquifers and the deep subsurface, with no reports from marine environments to date.",

    "abstract": "There exist many phenotypically-varied prion strains, like viruses, despite the absence of conventional genetic material which codes the phenotypic information. As prion is composed solely of the pathological isoform (PrPSc) of prion protein (PrP), the strain-specific traits are hypothesized to be enciphered in the structural details of PrPSc. Identification of the structures of PrPSc is therefore vital for the understanding of prion biology, though they remain unidentified due to the incompatibility of PrPSc with conventional high-resolution structural analyses. Based on our previous hypothesis that the region between the first and the second -helix (H1[~]H2) and the distal region of the third helix (Ctrm) of the cellular isoform of PrP (PrPC) have important roles for efficient interactions with PrPSc, we created series of mutant PrPs with two cysteine substitutions (C;C-PrP) which were systematically designed to form an intramolecular disulfide crosslink between H1[~]H2 and Ctrm and assessed their conformational changes by prions: Specifically, a cysteine substitution in H1[~]H2 from 165 to 169 was combined with cysteine-scanning along Ctrm from 220 to 229. C;C-PrPs with the crosslinks were expressed normally with the similar glycosylation patterns and subcellular localization as the wild-type PrP albeit with varied expression levels. Interestingly, some of the C;C-PrPs converted to the protease-resistant isoforms in the N2a cells persistently infected with 22L prion strain, whereas the same mutants did not convert in the cells infected with another prion strain Fukuoka1, indicating that local structures of PrPSc in these regions vary among prion strains and contribute to prion-strain diversity. Moreover, patterns of the crosslinks of the convertible C;C-PrPs implied drastic changes in positional relations of H1[~]H2 and Ctrm in the PrPSc-induced conformational changes by 22L prion. Thus, disulfide-crosslink scanning is a useful approach for investigation of strain-specific structures of PrPSc, and would be applicable to other types of amyloids as well.",

The Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium generated a reference catalogue of several key histone modifications across >100s of human cell types and tissues. Decoding these epigenomes into functional regulatory elements is a challenging task in computational biology. To this end, we adopted a differential chromatin modification analysis framework to comprehensively determine and characterize cell type-specific regulatory elements (CSREs) and their histone modification codes in the human epigenomes of five histone modifications across 127 tissues or cell types. The CSREs show significant relevance with cell type-specific biological functions and diseases and cell identity. Clustering of CSREs with their specificity signals reveals diverse histone codes, demonstrating the diversity of functional roles of CSREs within the same cell or tissue. Last but not least, dynamics of CSREs from close cell types or tissues can give a detailed view of developmental processes such as normal tissue development and cancer occurrence.",

    "abstract": "The increasing availability of microbiome survey data has led to the use of complex machine learning and statistical approaches to measure taxonomic diversity and extract relationships between taxa and their host or environment. However, many approaches inadequately account for the difficulties inherent to microbiome data. These difficulties include (1) insufficient sequencing depth resulting in sparse count data, (2) a large feature space relative to sample space, resulting in data prone to overfitting, (3) library size imbalance, requiring normalization strategies that lead to compositional artifacts, and (4) zero-inflation. Recent work has used probabilistic topics models to more appropriately model microbiome data, but a thorough inspection of just how well topic models capture underlying microbiome signal is lacking. Also, no work has determined whether library size or variance normalization improves model fitting. Here, we assessed a topic model approach on 16S rRNA gene survey data. Through simulation, we show, for small sample sizes, library-size or variance normalization is unnecessary prior to fitting the topic model. In addition, by exploiting topic-to-topic correlations, the topic model successfully captured dynamic time-series behavior of simulated taxonomic subcommunities. Lastly, when the topic model was applied to the David et al. time-series dataset, three distinct gut configurations emerged. However, unlike the David et al. approach, we characterized the events in terms of topics, which captured taxonomic co-occurrence, and posterior uncertainty, which facilitated the interpretation of how the taxonomic configurations evolved over time.",

    "abstract": "Many tumors are characterized by genetic instability, producing an assortment of genetic variants of tumor cells called subclones. These tumors and their surrounding environments form complex multi-cellular ecosystems, where subclones compete for resources and cooperate to perform multiple tasks, including cancer invasion. Our recent empirical studies revealed existence of such distinct phenotypes of cancer cells, leaders and followers, in lung cancer. These two cellular subclones exchange a complex array of extracellular signals demonstrating a symbiotic relationship at the cellular level. Here, we develop a computational model of the microenvironment of the lung cancer ecosystem to explore how the interactions between subclones can advance or inhibit invasion. We found that, due to the complexity of the ecosystem, invasion may have very different dynamics characterized by the different levels of aggressiveness. By altering the signaling environment, we could alter the ecological relationship between the cell types and the overall ecosystem development. Competition between leader and follower cell populations (defined by the limited amount of resources), positive feedback within the leader cell population (controlled by the focal adhesion kinase and fibronectin signaling), and impact of the follower cells to the leaders (represented by yet undetermined proliferation signal) all had major effects on the outcome of the collective dynamics. Specifically, our analysis revealed a class of tumors (defined by the strengths of fibronectin signaling and competition) that are particularly sensitive to manipulations of the signaling environment. This class can undergo irreversible changes to the tumor ecosystem that outlast these manipulations of feedbacks and have a profound impact on invasive potential. Our study predicts a complex division of labor between cancer cell subclones and suggests new treatment strategies targeting signaling within the tumor ecosystem.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryCancer is an elusive disease due to the wide variety of cancer types and adaptability to treatment. How is this adaptability accomplished? Loss of genetic stability, a hallmark of cancer, leads to the emergence of many different types of cancer cells within a tumor. This creates a complex ecosystem where cancer cell types can cooperate, compete, and exploit each other. We have previously used an image-guided technology to isolatedistinct cancer subclones and identify how they interact. Here, we have employed mathematical modeling to understand how the dynamic feedbacks between different cancer cell types can impact the success of invasion in lung cancer. We found that successful invasion required for feedbacks to support the less viable but more invasive cell types. These predictions may have implications for novel clinical treatment options and emphasize the need to visualize and probe cancer as a tumor ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Non-coding gene regulatory enhancers are essential to transcription in mammalian cells. As a result, a large variety of experimental and computational strategies have been developed to identify cis-regulatory enhancer sequences. In practice, most studies consider enhancers identified by only a single method, and the concordance of enhancers identified by different methods has not been comprehensively evaluated. Here, we assess the similarities of enhancer sets identified by ten representative strategies in four biological contexts and evaluate the robustness of downstream conclusions to the choice of identification strategy. All pairs of enhancer sets we evaluated overlap significantly more than expected by chance; however, we also found significant dissimilarity between enhancer sets in their genomic characteristics, evolutionary conservation, and association with functional loci within each context. We find most regions identified as enhancers are supported by only one method. The disagreement is sufficient to influence interpretation of GWAS SNPs and eQTL, and to lead to disparate conclusions about enhancer biology and disease mechanisms. We also find only limited evidence that regions identified by multiple enhancer identification methods are better candidates than those identified by a single method. Our results highlight the inherent complexity of enhancer biology and argue that current approaches have yet to adequately account for enhancer diversity. As a result, we cannot recommend the use of any single enhancer identification strategy in isolation. To facilitate assessment of enhancer diversity on studies conclusions, we developed creDB, a database of enhancer annotations designed to integrate into bioinformatics workflows. While our findings highlight a major challenge to mapping the genetic architecture of complex disease and interpreting regulatory variants found in patient genomes, a systematic understanding of similarities and differences in enhancer identification methodology will ultimately enable robust inferences about gene regulatory sequences.",

Here we infer active promoters using RNA-Seq data from 1,188 cancer samples with matched whole genome sequencing data. We find that alternative promoters are a major contributor to context-specific regulation of isoform expression and that alternative promoters are frequently deregulated in cancer, affecting known cancer-genes and novel candidates.

It is thought that these strand asymmetries arise as a result of mutational biases and selective constraints, particularly for energy efficiency. Analysis of compositional skews in a diverse set of bacteria provides a comparative context in which mutational and selective environmental constraints can be studied. These analyses typically require finished and well-annotated genomic sequences.\\n\\nResultsWe present three novel metrics for examining genome composition skews; all three metrics can be computed for unfinished or partially-annotated genomes. The first two metrics, (dot-skew and cross-skew) depend on sequence and gene annotation of a single genome, while the third metric (residual skew) highlights unusual genomes by subtracting a GC content-based model of a library of genome sequences. We applied these metrics to all 7738 available bacterial genomes, including partial drafts, and identified outlier species. A number of these outliers (i.e., Borrelia, Ehrlichia, Kinetoplastibacterium, and Phytoplasma) display similar skew patterns despite only distant phylogenetic relationship. While unrelated, some of the outlier bacterial species share lifestyle characteristics, in particular intracellularity and biosynthetic dependence on their hosts.\\n\\nConclusionsOur novel metrics appear to reflect the effects of biosynthetic constraints and adaptations to life within one or more hosts on genome composition.

We calibrated the model by optimizing the shape of the bacterial growth dose-response curve to antibiotic or metal exposure (the Hill coefficient, {kappa}) to fit previously published experimental growth rate difference data. The model fit varied among nine compound-taxa combinations examined, but predicted the experimentally observed MSC/MIC ratio well (R2 [&ge;] 0.95). The shape of the antibiotic response curve varied among compounds (0.7 [&le;] {kappa} [&le;] 10.5), with the steepest curve for the aminoglycosides streptomycin and kanamycin. The model was sensitive to this antibiotic response curve shape and to the sc, indicating the importance of fitness differences between strains for determining the MSC. The MSC can be more than one order of magnitude lower than the MIC, typically by a factor sc{kappa}. This study provides an initial quantitative depiction and a framework for a research agenda to examine the growing evidence of selection for resistant bacteria communities at low environmental antibiotic concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Tropical freshwater lake such as Tasik Kenyir are underrepresented among the growing number of environmental metagenomic data sets. In Tasik Kenyir, water from two different sites, pristine and disturbed areas were sampled. After the filtration process, genomic DNA from both sites were extracted using Meta-G-nome DNA isolation kit and shotgun metagenomic sequencing was carried out on Illumina HiSeq2500 Desktop Sequencer (Illumina, Inc.). Raw data were then trimmed and assembled using Metagenomic Assembler program, MetaVelvet. Data analysis was carried out using software Blast2GO (BioBam Bioinformatic S.L). The total number of sequence reads was 189,158 from TKS1.5m (disturbed area) and 246,577 from TKS2.5m (pristine area).The results indicate that sequence reads of microbial species were presence at disturbed area near the aquaculture zone was lower than the sequence reads of microbial species were presence at pristine area. When compared to archaea, both samples were dominated by bacteria (more than 90%) suggesting that bacteria are absolutely dominant in the prokaryotic communities in the freshwater samples. The lake appears to contain a mixture of autotrophs and heterotrophs capable of performing main biogeochemical cycles like nitrogen fixation by Klebsiella sp for TKS1.5m and Pontibacter sp. for TKS2.5m. and carbon fixation by heterotrophic Alcaligenes sp. and Shewanella decolorationi in TKS1.5m, and by Pantoea sp. in TKS2.5m. Present study will advance our understanding of the importance of freshwater microbial communities for ecosystem and human health.",

Here, we examine the microbiome of vitreous (intraocular body fluid) from patients who developed endophthalmitis following cataract surgery or intravitreal injection. Endophthalmitis is an inflammation of the intraocular cavity and can lead to a permanent loss of vision. As controls, we included vitreous from endophthalmitis-negative patients, balanced salt solution used during vitrectomy, and DNA extraction blanks. We compared two DNA isolation procedures and found that an ultraclean production of reagents appeared to reduce background DNA in these low microbial biomass samples. We created a curated microbial genome database (>5700 genomes) and designed a metagenomics workflow with filtering steps to reduce DNA sequences originating from: i) human hosts, ii) ambiguousness/contaminants in public microbial reference genomes, and iii) the environment. Our metagenomic read classification revealed in nearly all cases the same microorganism than was determined in cultivation- and mass spectrometry-based analyses. For some patients, we identified the sequence type of the microorganism and antibiotic resistance genes through analyses of whole genome sequence (WGS) assemblies of isolates and metagenomic assemblies. Together, we conclude that genomics-based analyses of human ocular body fluid specimens can provide actionable information relevant to infectious disease management.",

Here we define the dynamics of influenza A virus populations in human hosts through next generation sequencing of 249 specimens from 200 individuals collected over 6290 person-seasons of observation. Because these viruses were collected over 5 seasons from individuals in a prospective community-based cohort, they are broadly representative of natural human infections with seasonal viruses. We used viral sequence data from 35 serially sampled individuals to estimate a within host effective population size of 30-70 and an in vivo mutation rate of 4x10-5 per nucleotide per cellular infectious cycle. These estimates are consistent across several models and robust to the models' underlying assumptions. We also identified 43 epidemiologically linked and genetically validated transmission pairs. Maximum likelihood optimization of multiple transmission models estimates an effective transmission bottleneck of 1-2 distinct genomes. Our data suggest that positive selection of novel viral variants is inefficient at the level of the individual host and that genetic drift and other stochastic processes dominate the within and between host evolution of influenza A viruses.",

In particular, optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs) have reached sensitivity levels that enable their use in MEG. In contrast to the SQUID sensors used in current MEG systems, OPMs do not require cryogenic cooling and can thus be placed within millimetres from the head, enabling the construction of sensor arrays that conform to the shape of an individuals head. To properly estimate the location of neural sources within the brain, one must accurately know the position and orientation of sensors in relation to the head. With the adaptable on-scalp MEG sensor arrays, this coregistration becomes more challenging than in current SQUID-based MEG systems that use rigid sensor arrays.\\n\\nHere, we used simulations to quantify how accurately one needs to know the position and orientation of sensors in an on-scalp MEG system. The effects that different types of localisation errors have on forward modelling and source estimates obtained by minimum-norm estimation, dipole fitting, and beamforming are detailed.\\n\\nWe found that sensor position errors generally have a larger effect than orientation errors and that these errors affect the localisation accuracy of superficial sources the most. To obtain similar or higher accuracy than with current SQUID-based MEG systems, RMS sensor position and orientation errors should be < 4 mm and < 10{degrees}, respectively.",

This fact is the source of the wide variety of macroevolutionary change across time and taxa as well as the bane of pale-obiological research trying to understand how macroevolution works. Here, I present a general framework for understanding the variety of macroevolutionary phenomena. Based on Prices theorem, this framework provides a simple quantitative means to understand (1) the macroevolutionary processes that are possible and (2) the way those processes interact with each other. The major qualitative features of macroevolution depend first on the number of processes that co-occur and then on the magnitudes and evolutionary directions of those processes. Species selection, the major macroevolutionary process, consists of patterns of differential rates of speciation and extinction. Its macroevolutionary efficacy depends on the presences of sufficient microevolutionary change. Conversely, microevolutionary change is limited in power by the independent evolution of species, and species selection acting across populations of species can amplify or suppress microevolution. Non-trends may result if species selection sufficiently neutralizes microevolution and may yield stable macroevolutionary patterns over many millions of years.",

But little is known about the antidiabetic effects of marein which is the main component of C. tinctoria. This study investigated the effects of ethyl acetate extract of C. tinctoria (AC) on insulin resistance (IR) in rats fed a high-fat diet. High glucose and fat conditions cause a significant increase in blood glucose, insulin, serum TC,TG and LDL-C, leading to an abnormal IR in rats. However, treatment with AC protects against HFD-induced IR by improving fasting serum glucose and lipid homeostasis. High glucose conditions cause a significant decrease in glycogen synthesis and increases PEPCK and G6Pase protein levels and Krebs-cycle-related enzymes levels, leading to an abnormal metabolic state in HepG2 Cells. However, treatment with Marein improves IR by increasing glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis and by downregulating PEPCK and G6Pase protein levels. The statistical analysis of HPLC/MS data demonstrates that Marein restores the normal metabolic state. The results show that AC ameliorates IR in rats and Marein has the potential effect in improving IR by ameliorating glucose metabolic disorders.\\n\\nAbbreviations",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced Torsades de Pointes (TdP) arrhythmia is of major interest in predictive toxicology. Drugs which cause TdP block the hERG cardiac potassium channel. However, not all drugs that block hERG cause TdP. As such, further understanding of the mechanistic route to TdP is needed. Early afterde-polarisations (EADs) are a cell-level phenomenon in which the membrane of a cardiac cell depolarises a second time before repolarisation, and EADs are seen in hearts during TdP. Therefore, we propose a method of predicting TdP using induced EADs combined with multiple ion channel block in simulations using biophysically-based mathematical models of human ventricular cell electrophysiology. EADs were induced in cardiac action potential models using interventions based on diseases that are known to cause EADs, including: increasing the conduction of the L-type calcium channel, decreasing the conduction of the hERG channel, and shifting the inactivation curve of the fast sodium channel. The threshold of intervention that was required to cause an EAD was used to classify drugs into clinical risk categories. The metric that used L-type calcium induced EADs was the most accurate of the EAD metrics at classifying drugs into the correct risk categories, and increased in accuracy when combined with action potential duration measurements. The EAD metrics were all more accurate than hERG block alone, but not as predictive as simpler measures such as simulated action potential duration. This may be because different routes to EADs represent risk well for different patient subgroups, something that is difficult to assess at present.",

Here we propose that the conserved Hsp70 and Hsp90 chaperones support formation of the folding nucleus by providing a gradient of decreasing hydrophobicity. Early on the folding pathway Hsp70 uses its highly hydrophobic binding pocket to recover a stalled, unproductive folding intermediate. The aggressive nature of Hsp70 action, however, blocks productive folding by grabbing hydrophobic, core-forming segments. This precludes on-pathway nucleation at high, physiological Hsp70 levels. Transfer to the less hydrophobic Hsp90 enables the intermediate to resume forming its folding nucleus. Subsequently, the protein enters a spontaneous folding trajectory towards its native state, independent of the ATPase activities of both Hsp70 and Hsp90. Our findings provide a general mechanistic concept for chaperoned protein folding.",

In this work we gain understanding into the molecular determinants and bottlenecks in the unbinding of the dimeric biotinstreptavidin system in its wild type and with N23A mutation. Using new enhanced sampling methods with full atomistic resolution, we reproduce the variation caused by N23A mutation in experimentally reported residence time. We also answer a longstanding question regarding cause/effect in the coupled events of bond stretching and bond hydration during unbinding and establish that in this system, it is the bond stretching and not hydration which forms the bottleneck in the early parts of the unbinding. We believe these calculations represent a step forward in the use of atomistic simulations to study pharmacodynamics.

    "abstract": "3Immunotherapy is becoming increasingly important in the fight against cancers, utilizing and manipulating the bodys immune response to treat tumors. Understanding the immune repertoire - the collection of immunological proteins - of treated and untreated cells is possible at the genomic, but technically difficult at the protein level. Standard protein databases do not include the highly divergent sequences of somatic rearranged immunoglobulin genes, and may lead to missed identifications in a mass spectrometry search. We introduce a novel proteogenomic approach, AbScan, to identify these highly variable antibody peptides, by developing a customized antibody database construction method using RNA-seq reads aligned to immunoglobulin (Ig) genes.\\n\\nAbScan starts by filtering transcript (RNA-seq) reads that match the template for Ig genes. The retained reads are used to construct a repertoire graph using the  split de Bruijn graph: a graph structure that improves upon the standard de Bruijn graph to capture the high diversity of Ig genes in a compact manner. AbScan corrects for sequencing errors, and converts the graph to a format suitable for searching with MS/MS search tools. We used AbScan to create an antibody database from 90 RNA-seq colorectal tumor samples. Next, we used proteogenomics analysis to search MS/MS spectra of matched colorectal samples from the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) against the AbScan generated database. AbScan identified 1, 940 distinct antibody peptides. Correlating with previously identified Single Amino-Acid Variants (SAAVs) in the tumor samples, we identified 163 pairs (antibody peptide, SAAV) with significant co-occurrence pattern in the 90 samples. The presence of co-expressed antibody and mutated peptides was correlated with survival time of the individuals. Our results suggest that AbScan(https://github.com/csw407/AbScan.git) is an effective tool for a proteomic exploration of the immune response in cancers.\\n\\n\\n\\nO_TBL View this table:\\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@62001corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f542faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10048d0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ac5a75org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@66db0f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "Rapid environmental change in highly biodiverse tropical regions demands efficient biomonitoring programs. While existing metrics of species diversity and community composition rely on encounter-based survey data, eDNA recently emerged as alternative approach. Costs and ecological value of eDNA-based methods have rarely been evaluated in tropical regions, where high species richness is accompanied by high functional diversity (e.g. the use of different microhabitats by different species and life-stages). We first tested whether estimation of tropical frogs community structure derived from eDNA data is compatible with expert field assessments. Next we evaluated whether eDNA is a financially viable solution for biodiversity monitoring in tropical regions. We applied eDNA metabarcoding to investigate frog species occurrence in five ponds in the Chiquitano dry forest region in Bolivia and compared our data with a simultaneous visual and audio encounter survey (VAES). We found that taxon lists and community structure generated with eDNA and VAES correspond closely, and most deviations are attributable to different species life histories. Cost efficiency of eDNA surveys was mostly influenced by the richness of local fauna and the number of surveyed sites: VAES may be less costly in low-diversity regions, but eDNA quickly becomes more cost-efficient in high-diversity regions with many sites sampled. The results highlight that eDNA is suitable for large-scale biodiversity surveys in high-diversity areas if life history is considered, and certain precautions in sampling, genetic analyses and data interpretation are taken. We anticipate that spatially extensive, standardized eDNA biodiversity surveys will quickly emerge in the future.",

    "abstract": "1Microbes are present in high abundances in the environment and in human-associated microbiomes, often exceeding one million per milliliter. Viruses of microbes are present in even higher abundances and are important in shaping microbial populations, communities, and ecosystems. Given the relative specificity of viral infection, it is essential to identify the functional linkages between viruses and their microbial hosts, particularly given dynamic changes in virus and host abundances. Multiple approaches have been proposed to infer infection networks from time-series of in situ communities, among which correlation-based approaches have emerged as the de facto standard. In this work, we evaluate the accuracy of correlation-based inference methods using an in silico approach. In doing so, we compare predicted networks to actual networks to assess the self-consistency of correlation-based inference. At odds with assumptions underlying its widespread use, we find that correlation is a poor predictor of interactions in the context of viral infection and lysis of microbial hosts. The failure to predict interactions holds for methods which leverage product-moment, time-lagged, and relative-abundance based correlations. In closing, we discuss alternative inference methods, particularly model-based methods, as a means to infer interactions in complex microbial communities with viruses.\\n\\n2 ImportanceInferring interactions from population time-series is an active and ongoing area of research. It is relevant across many biological systems - in particular in virus-microbe communities, but also in gene regulatory networks, neural networks, and ecological communities broadly. Correlation-based inference - using correlations to predict interactions - is widespread. However, it is well known that \\\"correlation does not imply causation\\\". Despite this, many studies apply correlation-based inference methods to experimental time-series without first assessing the potential scope for accurate inference. Here, we find that several correlation-based inference methods fail to recover interactions within in silica virus-microbe communities, raising questions on their relevance when applied in situ.",

    "abstract": "More than 30% of mRNAs are repressed by microRNAs (miRNAs) but most repressions are too weak to have a phenotypic consequence. The diffuse actions have been a central conundrum in understanding the functions of miRNAs. By applying the May-Wigner theory used in foodweb studies, we show that i) weak repressions cumulatively enhance the stability of gene regulatory network (GRN), and ii) broad and weak repressions confer greater stability than a few strong ones. Transcriptome data show that yeast cells, which do not have miRNAs, use strong and non-specific mRNA degradation to stabilize their GRN; in contrast, human cells use miRNAs to increase degradation more modestly and selectively. Simulations indicate that miRNA repressions should be distributed broadly to >25% of mRNAs, in agreement with observations. As predicted, extremely highly expressed genes are avoided and transcription factors are preferred by miRNAs. In conclusion, the diffuse repression by miRNAs is likely a system-level strategy for enhancing GRN stability. This stability control may be the mechanistic basis of \\\"canalization\\\" (i.e., developmental homeostasis within each species), sometimes hypothesized to be a main function of miRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Prophages are a significant force in prokaryote evolution. The remaining sequences of a bacteriophage integration event are known for altering gene expression, enabling creative destruction of the bacterial genome and to induce pathogenicity by harboring and transposing virulence and antibiotic resistance factors. In the light of the dreadful expansion of antibiotic resistance bacteriophages have gathered renewed interest from the scientific community and public health decision makers as a promising long forgotten alternative to control bacterial infections. Cataloging the repertoire of prophages and their integration sites is an important initial step in the understanding of bacteriophages either as tool or as a threat. In this work, we present ProphET (Prophage Estimation Tool), a standalone application without the limitations of their web based counterparts and which identifies prophages in bacterial genomes with higher precision than similar applications.",

    "abstract": "Antagonistic host-pathogen co-evolution is a determining factor in the outcome of infection and shapes genetic diversity at the population level of both partners. While the molecular function of an increasing number of genes involved in pathogenicity is being uncovered, little is known about the molecular bases and genomic impact of hst-pathogen coevolution and rapid adaptation. Here, we apply a population genomic approach to infer genome-wide patterns of selection among thirteen isolates of the fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Using whole genome alignments, we characterize intragenic polymorphism, and we apply different test statistics based on the distribution of non-synonymous and synonymous polymorphisms (pN/pS) and substitutions (dN/dS) to (1) characterise the selection regime acting on each gene, (2) estimate rates of adaptation and (3) identify targets of selection. We correlate our estimates with different genome variables to identify the main determinants of past and ongoing adaptive evolution, as well as purifying and balancing selection. We report a negative relationship between pN/pS and fine-scale recombination rate and a strong positive correlation between the rate of adaptive non-synonymous substitutions ({omega}a) and recombination rate. This result suggests a pervasive role of Hill-Robertson interference even in a species with an exceptionally high recombination rate (60 cM/Mb). Moreover, we report that the genome-wide fraction of adaptive non-synonymous substitutions () is ~ 44%, however in genes encoding determinants of pathogenicity we find a mean value of alpha ~ 68% demonstrating a considerably faster rate of adaptive evolution in this class of genes. We identify 787 candidate genes under balancing selection with an enrichment of genes involved in secondary metabolism and host infection, but not predicted effectors. This suggests that different classes of pathogenicity-related genes evolve according to distinct selection regimes. Overall our study shows that sexual recombination is a main driver of genome evolution in this pathogen.",

    "abstract": "The joint analysis of species evolutionary relatedness and their morphological evolution has offered much promise in understanding the processes that underpin the generation of biological diversity. Disparity through time (DTT) is a popular method that estimates the relative trait disparity within and between subclades at each time point, and compares this to the null hypothesis that trait values follow an uncorrelated random walk along the time calibrated phylogenetic tree. A simulation envelope is normally created by calculating, at every time point, the 95% minimum and 95% maximum disparity values from multiple simulations of the null model on the phylogenetic tree. The null hypothesis is rejected whenever the empirical DTT curve falls outside of this envelope, and these time periods may then be linked to events that may have sparked non-random trait evolution. However, this method of envelope construction leads to multiple testing and a poor, uncontrolled, false positive rate. As a consequence it cannot be recommended. A recently developed method in spatial statistics is introduced that constructs a confidence envelope by giving each DTT curve a single ranking value based upon its most extreme disparity value. This method avoids the pitfalls of multiple testing whilst retaining a visual interpretation. Results using simulated data show this new test has desirable type 1 properties and is at least as powerful in correctly rejecting the null hypothesis as the morphological disparity index and node height test that lack a visual interpretation. Three example datasets are reanalyzed to show how the new test may lead to different inferences being drawn. Overall the results suggest the new rank envelope test should be used in null model testing for DTT analyses, and that there is no need to combine the envelope test with other tests such as has been done previously. Moreover, the rank envelope method can easily be adopted into recently developed posterior predictive simulation methods. More generally, the rank envelope test should be adopted when-ever a null model produces a vector of correlated values and the user wants to determine where the empirical data is different to the null model.",

To link specific microbes to specific phenotypes, microbiome-wide association studies compare microbial abundances between two groups of samples. Abundance differences, however, reflect not only direct associations with the phenotype, but also indirect effects due to microbial interactions. We found that microbial interactions could easily generate a large number of spurious associations that provide no mechanistic insight. Using techniques from statistical physics, we developed a method to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Our method corrected the inflation of p-values in standard association tests and showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had a much higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in the inflammatory bowel disease.",

In a recent study of 1,777 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella strains recovered from human infections in Houston, we discovered one strain (KPN1705) causing a wound infection that was phylogenetically distinct from all currently recognized Klebsiella species. Whole genome sequencing of strain KPN1705 revealed that it was single locus variant of the multilocus sequence type ST-1155. This sequence type was reported only once previously. To further investigate the phylogeny of these two organisms, we sequenced the genome of strain KPN1705 to closure and compared its genetic features to Klebsiella reference strains. Results demonstrated strain KPN1705 extensively shares core gene content, antimicrobial resistance genes, and plasmids with K. pneumoniae, K. quasipneumoniae and K. variicola. Since strain KPN1705 and the previously reported novel strain are phylogenetically most closely related to K. variicola, we propose the name K. quasivariicola sp. nov.",

    "abstract": "Red carotenoid-based coloration is widely distributed across marine and terrestrial animals and has taken a prominent role in studies of how phenotypic traits evolve in response to natural and sexual selection. Key to these studies is an understanding of the physiological mechanisms that give rise to red coloration, yet an ideal model system for such work has not been identified. The red marine copepod Tigriopus californicus is used as a model system for studies in ecotoxicology, genetics, and physiology, but the mechanisms involved in its bright red coloration have not been well studied. Like nearly all animals that display red carotenoid coloration, T. californicus likely convert yellow carotenoids present in their algal diet to red carotenoids. We conducted precursor/product feeding experiments to demonstrate that T. californicus bioconverts dietary carotenoids to the red carotenoid, astaxanthin. In separate treatment groups, copepods were fed carotenoids that are precursors to specific astaxanthin bioconversion pathways. We found that copepods from each precursor pigment group produced astaxanthin, and that the amount produced depended on which carotenoid was supplemented. We also describe the distribution of astaxanthin in developing egg sacs and show that the red color of the naupliar eyespot is not due to astaxanthin. We briefly discuss the potential of Tigriopus californicus to serve as a model system for the study of carotenoid metabolism in animals.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTIn this manuscript, I am proposing an approach for identification of correlated exchange in proteins via analysis of the NMR relaxation dispersion data. For a set of spins experiencing exchange, every relaxation dispersion datasets is fit individually and then--globally while paired with every other dataset. The corrected Akaike s Information Criteria (AICc) for individual and global fits are used to evaluate the likelihood of two spins to report on the same dynamic event. Application of hierarchical cluster analysis reveals correlated spin groups using the difference in AICcs as a measure of similarity within the pairs. This approach to detection of correlated dynamics is independent of accuracy of best-fit parameters rendering it less sensitive to experimental noise. High throughput and the absence of the operator bias might make it applicable to a relatively lower quality NMR relaxation dispersion data from large and poorly soluble systems.",

    "abstract": "Individual alpha frequency (IAF) is a promising electrophysiological marker of interindividual differences in cognitive function. IAF has been linked with trait-like differences in information processing and general intelligence, and provides an empirical basis for the definition of individualised frequency bands. Despite its widespread application, however, there is little consensus on the optimal method for estimating IAF, and many common approaches are prone to bias and inconsistency. Here, we describe an automated strategy for deriving two of the most prevalent IAF estimators in the literature: peak alpha frequency (PAF) and centre of gravity (CoG). These indices are calculated from resting-state power spectra that have been smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter (SGF). We evaluate the performance characteristics of this analysis procedure in both empirical and simulated EEG datasets. Applying the SGF technique to resting-state data from n = 63 healthy adults furnished 61 PAF, and 62 CoG estimates. The statistical properties of these estimates were consistent with previous reports. Simulation analyses revealed that the SGF routine was able to reliably extract target alpha components, even under relatively noisy spectral conditions. The routine consistently outperformed a simpler method of automated peak detection that did not involve spectral smoothing. The SGF technique is fast, open-source, and available in two popular programming languages (MATLAB and Python), and thus can easily be integrated within the most popular M/EEG toolsets (EEGLAB, FieldTrip and MNE-Python). As such, it affords a convenient tool for improving the reliability and replicability of future IAF-related research.",

    "abstract": "A prominent feature of the cortical systems controlling the whiskers in the adult rodent is tight coupling between sensory and motor systems. Stimulation of the whiskers evokes activation of discrete motor regions of cortex shortly after activation of the sensory cortex. To explore the factors that direct the development of sensorimotor functional connectivity, we recorded spontaneous and whisker-evoked cortical activity using voltage-sensitive imaging over a large (7X7 mm) craniotomy in postnatal rats (day 5-12) under anesthesia. We found that spontaneous bursts of activity in the barrel cortex were correlated predominantly with activity in motor (anterio-medial) cortex, at ages before whisker stimulation evoked activation in this area. Intracortical microstimulation and anatomical tracing experiments confirmed there were no functional or anatomical intracortical sensorimotor connections. We interpret these results as evidence that the spontaneous patterns of activity in the cortex synchronize functionally related regions of the brain prior to their maturation.\\n\\nAuthor ContributionsD.A.M, T.H.M., and M.H.M. designed the study.
