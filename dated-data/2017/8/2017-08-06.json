    "abstract": "MotivationDifferent ChIP-seq peak callers often produce different output results from the same input. Since different peak callers are known to produce differentially enriched peaks with a large variance in peak length distribution and total peak count, accurately annotating peak lists with their nearest genes can be an arduous process. Functional genomic annotation of histone modification ChIP-seq data can be a particularly challenging task, as chromatin marks that have inherently broad peaks with a diffuse range of signal enrichment (e.g., H3K9me1, H3K27me3) differ significantly from narrow peaks that exhibit a compact and localized enrichment pattern (e.g., H3K4me3, H3K9ac). In addition, varying degrees of tissue-dependent broadness of an epigenetic mark can make it difficult to accurately and reliably link sequencing data to biological function. Thus, there exists an unmet need to develop a software program that can precisely tailor the computational analysis of a ChIP-seq dataset to the specific peak coordinates of the data and its surrounding genomic features.\\n\\nResultsgeneXtendeR optimizes the functional annotation of ChIP-seq peaks by exploring relative differences in annotating ChIP-seq peak sets to variable-length gene bodies. In contrast to prior techniques, geneXtendeR considers peak annotations beyond just the closest gene, allowing users to investigate peak summary statistics for the first-closest gene, second-closest gene, ..., nth-closest gene whilst ranking the output according to biologically relevant events and iteratively comparing the fidelity of peak-to-gene overlap across a user-defined range of upstream and downstream extensions on the original boundaries of each genes coordinates. We tested geneXtendeR on 547 human transcription factor ChIP-seq ENCODE datasets and 198 human histone modification ChIP-seq ENCODE datasets, providing the analysis results as case studies.\\n\\nAvailabilityThe geneXtendeR R/Bioconductor package (including detailed introductory vignettes) is available under the GPL-3 Open Source license and is freely available to download from Bioconductor at: https://bioconductor.org/packages/geneXtendeR/\\n\\nAuthor summarygeneXtendeR makes functional annotation of ChIP-seq data more robust and precise, regardless of peak variability attributable to parameter tuning or peak caller algorithmic differences. Since different ChIP-seq peak callers produce differentially enriched peaks with large variance in peak length distribution and total peak count, annotating peak lists with their nearest genes can often be a noisy process where an adjacent second or third-closest gene may constitute a more viable biological candidate, e.g., during cases of linked genes that are located close to each other. As such, the goal of geneXtendeR is to robustly link differentially enriched peaks with their respective genes, thereby aiding experimental follow-up and validation in designing primers for a set of prospective gene candidates during qPCR.",

    "abstract": "Animals can show very different behaviors even in isogenic populations, but the underlying mechanisms to generate this variability remain elusive. We found that laboratory and isogenic zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae showed consistent individual behaviors when swimming freely in identical wells or in reaction to stimuli. We also found that this behavioral inter-individual variability was reduced when we impaired the histone deacetylation pathway. Individuals with high levels of histone H4 acetylation, and specifically H4K12, behaved similar to the average of the population, but those with low levels deviated from it. More precisely, we found a set of genomic regions whose histone H4 acetylation is reduced with the distance between the individual and the average population behavior. We found evidence that this modulation depends on a complex of Yin-yang 1 (YY1) and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) that binds to and deacetylates these regions. These changes were not only maintained at the transcriptional level but also amplified, as most target regions were located near genes encoding transcription factors. We suggest that stochasticity in the histone deacetylation pathway participates the generation of genetic-independent behavioral inter-individual variability.",

    "abstract": "The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) is central in higher-order cognition and behavioural flexibility. The computational nature of this region, however, has remained elusive. Here we propose a new model - the Reinforcement Meta Learner (RML) - based on the bidirectional anatomical connections of the ACC with midbrain catecholamine nuclei (VTA and LC). In this circuit, dACC learns which actions are valuable and acts accordingly. Crucially, this mechanism is optimized by recurrent connectivity with the midbrain: Midbrain catecholamines provide modulatory signals to dACC, controlling its internal parameters (e.g. learning rate), while these parameter modulations are in turn optimized by dACC afferents to the midbrain. This closed-loop system generates emergent (i.e., homunculus-free) control and supports learning to solve hierarchical decision problems without having an intrinsic hierarchical structure itself. Further, it can be combined with other cortical modules to optimize the processing of these modules. We outline how the RML solves the current theoretical stalemate on dACC by assimilating various previous proposals on ACC functioning, and how it captures critical empirical findings from an unprecedented range of domains (stability/plasticity balance, effort processing, working memory, and higher-order classical and instrumental conditioning).",

Previous phenomenological studies of the yellow dung fly Scathophaga stercoraria have demonstrated strong positive sexual and fecundity selection on male and female size. Nevertheless, the body size of flies from a Swiss study population has declined by almost 10% from 1993 to 2009. Given substantial heritability of body size, this negative evolutionary response of an evidently positively selected trait suggests important selective factors being missed (e.g. size-selective predation or parasitism). A periodic epidemic outbreak of the fungus Entomophthora scatophagae allowedassessment of selection exerted by this parasite fatal to adult flies. Fungal infection varied over the season from ca. 50% in the cooler and more humid spring and autumn to almost 0% in summer. The probability of dying from fungal infection increased with adult body size. All infected females died before laying eggs, so there was no fungus impact on female fecundity beyond its impact on mortality. Large males showed the typical mating advantage in the field, but this pattern of positive sexual selection was nullified by fungal infection. Mean fluctuating asymmetry of paired appendages (legs, wings) did not affect the viability, fecundity or mating success of yellow dung flies in the field. This study demonstrates rare parasite-mediated disadvantages of large adult body size in the field. Reduced ability to combat parasites such as Entomophthora may be an immunity cost of large size in dung flies, although the hypothesized trade-off between fluctuating asymmetry, a presumed indicator of developmental instability and environmental stress, and immunocompetence was not found here.",

    "abstract": "Tunicates are marine invertebrates that compose the closest phylogenetic group to the vertebrates. This chordate subphylum contains a particularly diverse range of reproductive methods, regenerative abilities and life-history strategies. Consequently, tunicates provide an extraordinary perspective into the emergence and diversity of chordate traits. To gain further insights into the evolution of the tunicate phylum, we have sequenced the genome of the colonial Stolidobranchian Botrylloides leachii.\\n\\nWe have produced a high-quality (90 % BUSCO genes) 159 Mb assembly, containing 82 % of the predicted total 194 Mb genomic content. The B. leachii genome is much smaller than that of Botryllus schlosseri (725 Mb), but comparable to those of Ciona robusta and Molgula oculata (both 160 Mb). We performed an orthologous clustering between five tunicate genomes that highlights sets of genes specific to some species, including a large group unique to colonial ascidians with gene ontology terms including cell communication and immune response.\\n\\nBy analysing the structure and composition of the conserved gene clusters, we identified many examples of multiple cluster breaks and gene dispersion, suggesting that several lineage-specific genome rearrangements occurred during tunicate evolution. In addition, we investigate lineage-specific gene gain and loss within the Wnt, Notch and retinoic acid pathways. Such examples of genetic change within these highly evolutionary conserved pathways commonly associated with regeneration and development may underlie some of the diverse regenerative abilities observed in the tunicate subphylum. These results supports the widely held view that tunicate genomes are evolving particularly rapidly.",

The objective of this report was to assess the safety and negative effects of the Brain Power Autism System (BPAS), a novel AR smartglasses-based social communication aid for people with ASD. A sequential series of 18 children and adults aged 4.4 to 21.5 years (mean 12.2 years) with clinically diagnosed ASD of varying severity used the BPAS. Users and caregivers were interviewed about perceived negative effects and design concerns. Most users were able to wear and use the BPAS (n=16/18, 89%), with most of them reporting no negative effects (n=14/16, 87.5%). Two users reported temporary negative effects: eye strain, dizziness, and nasal discomfort. Caregivers observed no negative effects in users (n=16/16, 100%). Most users (77.8%) and caregivers (88.9%) had no design concerns. This report found no major negative effects in using an AR smartglasses-based social communication aid across a wide age and severity range of people with ASD. Further research is needed to explore longer-term effects of using AR smartglasses in this population.",

Aside from the obvious artifacts induced by the magnetic pulses themselves, separate and more sinister signal disturbances arise as a result of contact between the TMS coil and EEG electrodes.\\n\\nNew methodHere we profile the characteristics of these artifacts and introduce a simple device - the coil spacer - to provide a platform allowing physical separation between the coil and electrodes during stimulation.\\n\\nResultsEEG data revealed high amplitude signal disturbances when the TMS coil was in direct contact with the EEG electrodes, well within the physiological range of viable EEG signals. The largest artifacts were located in the Delta and Theta frequency range, and standard data cleanup using independent components analysis (ICA) was ineffective due to the artifacts similarity to real brain oscillations.\\n\\nComparison with Existing MethodWhile the current best practice is to use a large coil holding apparatus to fixate the coil  hovering over the head with an air gap, the spacer provides a simpler solution that ensures this distance is kept constant throughout testing.\\n\\nConclusionsThe results strongly suggest that data collected from combined TMS-EEG studies with the coil in direct contact with the EEG cap are polluted with low frequency artifacts that are indiscernible from physiological brain signals. The coil spacer provides a cheap and simple solution to this problem and is recommended for use in future simultaneous TMS-EEG recordings.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) methods such as decoding and representational similarity analysis (RSA) are growing rapidly in popularity for the analysis of magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. However, little is known about the relative performance and characteristics of the specific dissimilarity measures used to describe differences between evoked activation patterns. Here we used a multisession MEG dataset to qualitatively characterize a range of dissimilarity measures and to quantitatively compare them with respect to classification accuracy (for decoding) and between-session reliability of representational dissimilarity matrices (for RSA). We tested dissimilarity measures from a range of classifiers (Linear Discriminant Analysis - LDA, Support Vector Machine - SVM, Weighted Robust Distance - WeiRD, Gaussian Naive Bayes - GNB) and distances (Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation). In addition, we evaluated three key processing choices: 1) preprocessing (noise normalisation, removal of the pattern mean), 2) weighting classification accuracies by decision values, and 3) computing distances in three different partitioning schemes (non-cross-validated, cross-validated, within-class-corrected). Four main conclusions emerged from our results. First, multivariate noise normalization dramatically improved classification accuracies and the reliability of dissimilarity measures. Second, LDA, SVM and WeiRD yielded high peak classification accuracies and nearly identical time courses. Third, while using classification accuracies for RSA was markedly less reliable than continuous distances, this disadvantage was ameliorated by decision-value-weighting of classification accuracies. Fourth, the cross-validated Euclidean distance provided unbiased distance estimates and highly replicable representational dissimilarity matrices. Overall, we strongly advice the use of multivariate noise normalisation as a general preprocessing step, recommend LDA, SVM and WeiRD as classifiers for decoding and highlight the cross-validated Euclidean distance as a reliable and unbiased default choice for RSA.",

    "abstract": "MLST (multi-locus sequence typing) is a classic technique for genotyping bacteria, widely applied for pathogen outbreak surveillance. Traditionally, MLST is based on identifying sequence types from a small number of housekeeping genes. With the increasing availability of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data, MLST methods have evolved toward larger typing schemes, based on a few hundred genes (core genome MLST, cgMLST) to a few thousand genes (whole genome MLST, wgMLST). Such large-scale MLST schemes have been shown to provide a finer resolution and are increasingly used in various contexts such as hospital outbreaks or foodborne pathogen outbreaks. This methodological shift raises new computational challenges, especially given the large size of the schemes involved. Very few available MLST callers are currently capable of dealing with large MLST schemes.\\n\\nWe introduce MentaLiST, a new MLST caller, based on a k-mer voting algorithm and written in the Julia language, specifically designed and implemented to handle large typing schemes. We test it on real and simulated data to show that MentaLiST is faster than any other available MLST caller while providing the same or better accuracy, and is capable of dealing with MLST scheme with up to thousands of genes while requiring limited computational resources.

However, the matrices used, such as agarose pads, lack the structured geometry of many natural microbial habitats, including in the soil or on the surfaces of plants or animals. Here we address the important question of how such geometry may control diffusive exchanges and microbial interaction. We model mathematically mutualistic interactions within a minimal unit of structure: two growing reservoirs linked by a diffusive channel through which metabolites are exchanged. The model is applied to study a synthetic mutualism, experimentally parameterised on a model algal-bacterial co-culture. Analytical and numerical solutions of the model predict conditions for the successful establishment of remote mutualisms, and how this depends, often counterintutively, on diffusion geometry.

    "abstract": "North Mesopotamia has witnessed dramatic political and social change since the Bronze Age, but the impact of these events on its demographic history is little understood. Here we study this question by analysing the recently excavated Late Iron Age settlement of Cemialo Srt in Batman, southeast Turkey. Archaeological and/or radiocarbon evidence indicate that the site was inhabited during two main periods: the first half of the 2nd millennium BCE and the first millennium BCE. Cemialo Srt reveals nomadic items of the Early Iron Age, as well as items associated with the Late Achaemenid and subsequent Hellenistic Periods. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes from 12 Cemialo Srt individuals reveal high genetic diversity in this population, conspicuously higher than early Holocene west Eurasian populations, which supports the notion of increasing population admixture in west Eurasia through the Holocene. Still, in its mtDNA composition, Cemialo Srt shows highest affinity to Neolithic north Syria and Neolithic Anatolia among ancient populations studied, and to modern-day southwest Asian populations. Population genetic simulations do not reject continuity between Neolithic and Iron Age, nor between Iron Age and present-day populations of the region. Despite the regions complex political history and indication for increased genetic diversity over time, we find no evidence for sharp shifts in north Mesopotamian maternal genetic composition within the last 10,000 years.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms regulating mammalian meiotic progression are poorly understood. Here we identify mouse YTHDC2 as a critical component. A screen yielded a sterile mutant, \\\"ketu\\\", caused by a Ythdc2 missense mutation. Mutant germ cells enter meiosis but proceed prematurely to aberrant metaphase and apoptosis, and display defects in transitioning from spermatogonial to meiotic gene expression programs. ketu phenocopies mutants lacking MEIOC, a YTHDC2 partner. Consistent with roles in post-transcriptional regulation, YTHDC2 is cytoplasmic, has 3' [-&gt;] 5' RNA helicase activity in vitro, and has similarity within its YTH domain to an N6-methyladenosine recognition pocket. Orthologs are present throughout metazoans, but are diverged in nematodes and, more dramatically, Drosophilidae, where Bgcn is descended from a Ythdc2 gene duplication. We also uncover similarity between MEIOC and Bam, a Bgcn partner unique to schizophoran flies. We propose that regulation of gene expression by YTHDC2-MEIOC is an evolutionarily ancient strategy for controlling the germline transition into meiosis.",

    "abstract": "The past few years have seen an emergence of approaches that leverage temporal changes in whole-brain patterns of functional connectivity (the chronnectome). In this chronnectome study, we investigate the replicability of the human brain's inter-regional coupling dynamics during rest by evaluating two different dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) analysis frameworks using 7500 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets. To quantify the extent to which the emergent functional connectivity (FC) patterns are reproducible, we characterize the temporal dynamics by deriving several summary measures across multiple large, independent age-matched samples. Reproducibility was demonstrated through the existence of basic connectivity patterns (FC states) amidst an ensemble of inter-regional connections. Furthermore, application of the methods to conservatively configured surrogate datasets establishes that the correlation structures in the data do not arise by chance. This extensive testing of reproducibility of similarity statistics also suggests that the estimated FC states are robust against variation in data quality, analysis, grouping, and decomposition methods. We conclude that future investigations probing the functional and neurophysiological relevance of time-varying connectivity assume critical importance.",

    "abstract": "Determining the binding locations of regulatory factors, such as transcription factors and histone modifications, is essential to both basic biology research and many clinical applications. Obtaining such genome-wide location maps directly is often invasive and resource-intensive, so it is common to impute binding locations from DNA sequence or measures of chromatin accessibility. We introduce DeepATAC, a deep-learning approach for imputing binding locations that uses both DNA sequence and chromatin accessibility as measured by ATAC-seq. DeepATAC significantly outperforms current approaches such as FIMO motif predictions overlapped with ATAC-seq peaks, and models based only on DNA sequence, such as DeepSEA. Visualizing the input importances for the DeepATAC model reveals DNA sequence motifs and ATAC-seq signal patterns that are important for predicting binding events. The Keras implementation and analysis pipelines of DeepATAC are available at https://github.com/hiranumn/deepatac.",

    "abstract": "Sodium azide prevents bacterial growth by inhibiting the activity of SecA, which is required for translocation of proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Azide inhibits ATP turnover in vitro, but its mechanism of action in vivo is unclear. To investigate how azide inhibits SecA in cells, we used transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS) to screen a library of transposon insertion mutants for mutations that affect the susceptibility of E. coli to azide. Insertions disrupting components of the Sec machinery generally increased susceptibility to azide, but insertions truncating the C-terminal tail (CTT) of SecA decreased susceptibility of E. coli to azide. Treatment of cells with azide caused increased aggregation of the CTT, suggesting that azide disrupts its structure. Analysis of the metal-ion content of the CTT indicated that SecA binds to iron and the azide disrupts the interaction of the CTT with iron. Azide also disrupted binding of SecA to membrane phospholipids, as did alanine substitutions in the metal-coordinating amino acids. Furthermore, treating purified phospholipid-bound SecA with azide in the absence of added nucleotide disrupted binding of SecA to phospholipids. Our results suggest that azide does not inhibit SecA by inhibiting the rate of ATP turnover in vivo. Rather, azide inhibits SecA by causing it to \\\"backtrack\\\" from the ADP-bound to the ATP-bound conformation, which disrupts the interaction of SecA with the cytoplasmic membrane.\\n\\nSignificance statementSecA is a bacterial ATPase that is required for the translocation of a subset of secreted proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane. Sodium azide is a well-known inhibitor of SecA, but its mechanism of action in vivo is poorly understood. To investigate this mechanism, we examined the effect of azide on the growth of a library of [~]1 million transposon insertion mutations. Our results suggest that azide causes SecA to backtrack in its ATPase cycle, which disrupts binding of SecA to the membrane and to its metal cofactor, which is iron. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanism by which SecA drives protein translocation and how this essential biological process can be disrupted.",

    "abstract": "Fear extinction involves the formation of a new memory trace that attenuates fear responses to a conditioned aversive memory, and extinction impairments are implicated in trauma- and stress-related disorders. Previous studies in rodents have found that the infralimbic prefrontal cortex (IL) and its glutamatergic projections to the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and basomedial amygdala (BMA) instruct the formation of fear extinction memories. However, it is unclear whether these pathways are exclusively involved in extinction, or whether other major targets of the IL, such as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) also play a role. To address this outstanding issue, the current study employed a combination of electrophysiological and chemogenetic approaches in mice to interrogate the role of IL-BLA and IL-NAc pathways in extinction. Specifically, we used patch-clamp electrophysiology coupled with retrograde tracing to examine changes in neuronal activity of the IL and prelimbic cortex (PL) projections to both the BLA and NAc following fear extinction. We found that extinction produced a significant increase in the intrinsic excitability of IL-BLA projection neurons, while extinction appeared to reverse fear induced changes in IL-NAc projection neurons. To establish a causal counterpart to these observations, we then used a pathway-specific Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD) strategy to selectively inhibit PFC-BLA projection neurons during extinction acquisition. Using this approach, we found that DREADD-mediated inhibition of PFC-BLA neurons during extinction acquisition impaired subsequent extinction retrieval. Taken together, our findings provide further evidence for a critical contribution of the IL-BLA neural circuit to fear extinction.",

    "abstract": "There is now extensive evidence that the hippocampus replays experiences during quiet rest periods, and that this replay benefits subsequent memory. A critical open question is how memories are prioritized for replay during these offline periods. We addressed this question in an experiment in which participants learned the features of 15 objects and then underwent fMRI scanning to track item-level replay in the hippocampus using pattern analysis during a rest period. Objects that were remembered less well were replayed more during the subsequent rest period, suggesting a prioritization process in which weaker memories--memories most vulnerable to forgetting--are selected for wake replay. Participants came back for a second session, either after a night of sleep or a day awake, and underwent another scanned rest period followed by a second memory test. In the second session, more hippocampal replay of a satellite during the rest period predicted better subsequent memory for that satellite. Only in the group with intervening sleep did rest replay predict improvement from the first to second session. Our results provide the first evidence that replay of individual memories occurs during rest in the human hippocampus and that this replay prioritizes weakly learned information, predicts subsequent memory performance, and relates to memory improvement across a delay with sleep.",

    "abstract": "Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities have contributed substantially to climate change, by adding CO2 to the atmosphere, especially since the mid-20th century (the \\\"Great Acceleration\\\"). Climatic change does not have the same impact on different regions of the Earth, neither in the recorded past, nor in models of the future. Therefore, to anticipate on these changes, we need to understand and be able to predict the possible responses of the different regional vegetations of the world to these changes, and most significantly to increased drought conditions. The aim of this study is to understand the response of the xerophytes of the immense oriental Irano-Turanian bioregion to post-industrial global warming and to compare it with the response of the xerophytes of the neighbouring occidental Mediterranean bioregion. We measured stomata index and stomata density from 83 herbarium sheets (coll. 1821-2014) from species of the non-succulent xerophyte, Haplophyllum. We tested for differences before and after the \\\"Great Acceleration\\\" in both bioregions. SI decreased in the occidental species (significant only for abaxial leaf side), whereas SI significantly increased in the oriental species (both sides). We suggest that changes in both occidental and oriental species are linked to atmospheric CO2 due to the different constraints that act on their growth. In light-limited occidental species, atmospheric CO2 caused the stomata index decrease, whereas in the predominantly water-limited oriental species, increased drought stress and temperature (climatic change) caused stomata index increase. In conclusion, we propose that whereas atmospheric CO2 directly caused a decrease in stomata index in occidental xerophytes, it indirectly caused an increase in stomata index in oriental xerophytes via climate change (increase in aridity, drought stress, and temperature). This study highlights the considerable potential of research based on historical herbarium collections to answer ecological questions, especially regarding climatic change.",
