    "abstract": "Fiber tractography based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has become an important research tool for investigating the anatomical connectivity between brain regions in vivo. Combining DTI with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows for the mapping of structural and functional architecture of large-scale networks for cognitive processing. This line of research has shown that ventral and dorsal fiber pathways subserve different aspects of bottom-up- and top-down processing in the human brain.\\n\\nHere, we investigate the feasibility and applicability of Euclidean distance as a simple geometric measure to differentiate ventral and dorsal long-range white matter fiber pathways tween parietal and inferior frontal cortical regions, employing a body of studies that used probabilistic tractography.\\n\\nWe show that ventral pathways between parietal and inferior frontal cortex have on average a significantly longer Euclidean distance in 3D-coordinate space than dorsal pathways. We argue that Euclidean distance could provide a simple measure and potentially a boundary value to assess patterns of connectivity in fMRI studies. This would allow for a much broader assessment of general patterns of ventral and dorsal large-scale fiber connectivity for different cognitive operations in the large body of existing fMRI studies lacking additional DTI data.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications by the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) are essential for diverse cellular functions. Large-scale experiment and sequence-based predictions have identified thousands of SUMOylated proteins. However, the overlap between the datasets is small, suggesting many false positives with low functional relevance. Therefore, we integrated ~800 sequence features and protein characteristics such as cellular function and protein-protein interactions in a machine learning approach to score likely functional SUMOylation events (iSUMO). iSUMO is trained on a total of 24 large-scale datasets, and it predicts 2,291 and 706 SUMO targets in human and yeast, respectively. These estimates are five times higher than what existing sequence-based tools predict at the same 5% false positive rate. Protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions are highly predictive of protein SUMOylation, supporting a role of the modification in protein complex formation. We note the marked prevalence of SUMOylation amongst RNA-binding proteins. We validate iSUMO predictions by experimental or other evidence. iSUMO therefore represents a comprehensive tool to identify high-confidence, functional SUMOylation events for human and yeast.",

    "abstract": "SummaryChemical-genomic approaches that map interactions between small molecules and genetic perturbations offer a promising strategy for functional annotation of uncharacterized bioactive compounds. We recently developed a new high-throughput platform for mapping chemical-genetic (CG) interactions in yeast that can be scaled to screen large compound collections, and we applied this system to generate CG interaction profiles for more than 13,000 compounds. When integrated with the existing global yeast genetic interaction network, CG interaction profiles can enable mode-of-action prediction for previously uncharacterized compounds as well as discover unexpected secondary effects for known drugs. To facilitate future analysis of these valuable data, we developed a public database and web interface named MOSAIC. The website provides a convenient interface for querying compounds, bioprocesses (GO terms), and genes for CG information including direct CG interactions, bioprocesses, and gene-level target predictions. MOSAIC also provides access to chemical structure information of screened molecules, chemical-genomic profiles, and the ability to search for compounds sharing structural and functional similarity. This resource will be of interest to chemical biologists for discovering new small molecule probes with specific modes-of-action as well as computational biologists interested in analyzing CG interaction networks.\\n\\nAvailabilityMOSAIC is available at http://mosaic.cs.umn.edu.\\n\\nContactchadm@umn.edu, charlie.boone@utoronto.ca, yoshidam@riken.jp, or hisyo@riken.jp",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional silencing by heritable cytosine-5 methylation is an ancient strategy to repress transposable elements. It was previously thought that mammals possess four DNA methyltransferase paralogs--Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b and Dnmt3l--that establish and maintain cytosine-5 methylation. Here we identify a fifth paralog, Dnmt3c, that is essential for retrotransposon methylation and repression in the mouse male germline. From a phenotype-based forward genetics screen, we isolated a mutant mouse called  rahu, which displays severe defects in double-strand-break repair and homologous chromosome synapsis during male meiosis, resulting in sterility. rahu is an allele of a transcription unit (Gm14490, renamed Dnmt3c) that was previously mis-annotated as a Dnmt3-family pseudogene. Dnmt3c encodes a cytosine methyltransferase homolog, and Dnmt3crahu mutants harbor a non-synonymous mutation of a conserved residue within one of its cytosine methyltransferase motifs, similar to a mutation in human DNMT3B observed in patients with immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial anomalies syndrome. The rahu mutation lies at a potential dimerization interface and near the potential DNA binding interface, suggesting that it compromises protein-protein and/or protein-DNA interactions required for normal DNMT3C function in vivo. Dnmt3crahu mutant males fail to establish normal methylation within LINE and LTR retrotransposon sequences in the germline and accumulate higher levels of transposon-derived transcripts and proteins, particularly from distinct L1 and ERVK retrotransposon families. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that Dnmt3c arose during rodent evolution by tandem duplication of Dnmt3b, after the divergence of the Dipodoidea and Muroidea superfamilies. These findings provide insight into the evolutionary dynamics and functional specialization of the transposon suppression machinery critical for mammalian sexual reproduction and epigenetic regulation.",

    "abstract": "We accurately perceive the visual scene despite moving our eyes ~3 times per second, an ability that requires incorporation of eye position and retinal information. We assessed how this neural computation unfolds across three interconnected structures: frontal eye fields (FEF), intraparietal cortex (LIP/MIP), and the superior colliculus (SC). Single unit activity was assessed in head-restrained monkeys performing visually-guided saccades from different initial fixations. As previously shown, the receptive fields of most LIP/MIP neurons shifted to novel positions on the retina for each eye position, and these locations were not clearly related to each other in either eye- or head-centered coordinates (hybrid coordinates). In contrast, the receptive fields of most SC neurons were stable in eye-centered coordinates. In FEF, visual signals were intermediate between those patterns: around 60% were eye-centered, whereas the remainder showed changes in receptive field location, boundaries, or responsiveness that rendered the response patterns hybrid or occasionally head-centered. These results suggest that FEF may act as a transitional step in an evolution of coordinates between LIP/MIP and SC. The persistence across cortical areas of hybrid representations that do not provide unequivocal location labels in a consistent reference frame has implications for how these representations must be read-out.\\n\\nNew & NoteworthyHow we perceive the world as stable using mobile retinas is poorly understood. We compared the stability of visual receptive fields across different fixation positions in three visuomotor regions. Irregular changes in receptive field position were ubiquitous in intraparietal cortex, evident but less common in the frontal eye fields, and negligible in the superior colliculus (SC), where receptive fields shifted reliably across fixations. Only the SC provides a stable labelled-line code for stimuli across saccades.",

    "abstract": "Feedforward neural networks provide the dominant model of how the brain performs visual object recognition. However, these networks lack the lateral and feedback connections, and the resulting recurrent neuronal dynamics, of the ventral visual pathway in the human and nonhuman primate brain. Here we investigate recurrent convolutional neural networks with bottom-up (B), lateral (L), and top-down (T) connections. Combining these types of connections yields four architectures (B, BT, BL, and BLT), which we systematically test and compare. We hypothesized that recurrent dynamics might improve recognition performance in the challenging scenario of partial occlusion. We introduce two novel occluded object recognition tasks to test the efficacy of the models, digit clutter (where multiple target digits occlude one another) and digit debris (where target digits are occluded by digit fragments). We find that recurrent neural networks outperform feedforward control models (approximately matched in parametric complexity) at recognising objects, both in the absence of occlusion and in all occlusion conditions. Recurrent networks were also found to be more robust to the inclusion of additive Gaussian noise. Recurrent neural networks are better in two respects: (1) they are more neurobiologically realistic than their feedforward counterparts; (2) they are better in terms of their ability to recognise objects, especially under challenging conditions. This work shows that computer vision can benefit from using recurrent convolutional architectures and suggests that the ubiquitous recurrent connections in biological brains are essential for task performance.",

    "abstract": "Eusocial insect colonies are defined by extreme variation in reproductive activity among castes, but the ancestral conditions from which this variation arose are unknown. Investigating the factors that contribute to variation in reproductive physiology among solitary insects that are closely related to social species can help to fill this gap. We experimentally tested the role of nutrition, juvenile hormone, and social cues on reproductive maturation in solitary alkali bees (Halictidae: Nomia melanderi). We find that alkali bee females emerge from overwintering with small Dufour's glands and small ovaries, containing oocytes in the early stages of development. Oocyte maturation occurs rapidly, and is staggered between the two ovaries. Lab-reared females reached reproductive maturity without access to mates or nesting opportunities, and many had resorbed oocytes. Initial activation of these reproductive structures does not depend on pollen consumption, though dietary protein or lipids may be necessary for long-term reproductive activity. JH is likely to be a limiting factor in alkali bee reproductive activation, as females treated with JH were more likely to develop mature oocytes and Dufour's glands. Unlike for related social bees, the effects of JH were not suppressed by the presence of older, reproductive females. These results provide important insight into the factors that influence reproductive activity in an important native pollinator, and those that may have been particularly important in the evolution of reproductive castes.",

    "abstract": "How do new promoters evolve? To follow evolution of de novo promoters, we put various random sequences upstream to the lac operon in Escherichia coli and evolved the cells in the presence of lactose. We found that a typical random sequence of ~100 bases requires only one mutation in order to enable growth on lactose by increasing resemblance to the canonical promoter motifs. We further found that ~10% of random sequences could serve as active promoters even without any period of evolutionary adaptation. Such a short mutational distance from a random sequence to an active promoter may improve evolvability yet may also lead to undesirable accidental expression. We found that across the E. coli genome accidental expression is minimized by avoiding codon combinations that resemble promoter motifs. Our results suggest that the promoter recognition machinery has been tuned to allow high accessibility to new promoters, and similar findings might also be observed in higher organisms or in other motif recognition machineries, like transcription factor binding sites or protein-protein interactions.",

    "abstract": "Animals must integrate the activity of multiple mechanoreceptors to navigate complex environments. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the general roles of the mechanosensory neurons have been defined, but most studies involve end-point or single-time-point measurements, and thus lack dynamical information. Here, we formulate a set of unbiased quantitative characterizations of the mechanosensory system by using reverse correlation analysis on behavior. We use a custom tracking, selective illumination, and optogenetics platform to compare two mechanosensory systems: the gentle-touch (TRNs) and harsh-touch (PVD) circuits. This method yields characteristic linear filters that allow for prediction of behavioral responses. The resulting filters are consistent with previous findings, and further provide new insights on the dynamics and spatial encoding of the systems. Our results suggest that the tiled network of the gentle-touch neurons has better resolution for spatial encoding than the harsh-touch neurons. Additionally, linear-nonlinear models accurately predict behavioral responses based only on sensory neuron activity. Our results capture the overall dynamics of behavior induced by the activation of sensory neurons, providing simple transformations that quantitatively characterize these systems. Furthermore, this platform can be extended to capture the behavioral dynamics induced by any neuron or other excitable cells in the animal.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAnimals constantly integrate the activity of neurons throughout their bodies to choose the most appropriate behavior. A key goal in quantitative neuroscience is to characterize and predict how neuronal circuits control and modulate behavior. C. elegans, a nematode with a fully mapped connectome, is an ideal model organism for elucidating the links between neuronal circuits and behavior. However, many studies relating activity in neurons to behavior rely on spontaneous behavior and lack information about their dynamics. In this study, we formulate unbiased quantitative characterizations of sensory neurons in C. elegans using with reverse correlation analysis with a white noise stimulus. We use optogenetics to stimulate body touch sensory neurons in freely moving worms, and provide quantitative descriptions that capture the dynamic transformations between sensory neuron activity and behavioral outputs. Our results are consistent with previous findings, and additionally provide new insights on the spatial encoding of these systems. Our system provides a simple platform for characterizing the behavioral output due to specific neurons, and can be extended to any excitable cell in the animal.",

However, recent whole-genome sequencing has revealed that most commercially available ale yeasts are highly related and represent a small fraction of the genetic diversity found among S. cerevisiae isolates as a whole. This lack of diversity limits the phenotypic variations between these strains, which translates into a limited number of sensory compounds created during fermentation. Here, we characterized a collection of wild S. cerevisiae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. paradoxus strains for their ability to ferment wort into beer. Although many isolates performed well, S. cerevisiae strain YH166 was the most promising, displaying excellent fermentation kinetics and attenuation, as well as a tropical fruit sensory profile. Use of this strain in multiple styles of beer suggested that it is broadly applicable in the brewing industry. Thus, YH166 is a novel ale strain that can be used to lend fruity esters to beer and should pair well with citrusy hops in hop-forward ales.",

    "abstract": "In a screen of voluntary wheel-running behavior designed to identify genetic mouse models of chronic fatigue in ENU mutagenized C57BL/6J mice, we discovered two lines that showed aberrant wheel-running patterns. These lines both stem from a single original founder identified as a low body-weight candidate in a recessive screen. Progeny from both of these lines showed the abnormal wheel-running behavior, with affected mice showing significantly lower daily activity levels than unaffected mice. They also exhibited low amplitude circadian rhythms, consisting of lower activity levels during the normal active phase, and increased levels of activity during the rest or light phase, but only a modest alteration in free-running period. Their activity is not consolidated into longer bouts, but is frequently interrupted with periods of inactivity throughout the dark phase of the light-dark (LD) cycle. As seen with the low body weight, expression of the behavioral phenotypes in offspring of strategic crosses was consistent with a recessive heritance pattern. Mapping of these phenotypic abnormalities showed linkage to a single locus on chromosome 11, and whole exome sequencing (WES) identified a single point mutation in the Slc2a4 gene encoding the GLUT4 insulin-responsive glucose transporter. The single nucleotide change (A to T) was found in the distal end of exon 10, and results in a premature stop (Y440*). To our knowledge, this is the first time a mutation in this gene has been shown to result in extensive changes in general behavioral patterns.\\n\\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTChronic fatigue is a debilitating and devastating disorder with widespread consequences for both the patient and the persons around them, but effective treatment strategies are lacking. The identification of novel genetic mouse models of chronic fatigue may prove invaluable for the study of its underlying physiological mechanisms and for the testing of treatments and interventions. A novel mutation in Slc2a4 (GLUT4) was identified in a forward mutagenesis screen because affected mice showed abnormal daily patterns and levels of wheel running consistent with chronic fatigue. This new mouse model may shed light on the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue.",

This ratio may be under the dynamic control of neuromodulatory systems, which are in turn implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. In particular, the catecholaminergic (dopaminergic and noradrenergic) and cholinergic systems have highly specific effects on excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons, which might translate into changes in the local net E/I ratio. Here, we assessed and compared their net effects on net E/I ratio in human cortex, through an integrated application of computational modeling, placebo-controlled pharmacological intervention, magnetoencephalographic recordings of cortical activity dynamics, and perceptual psychophysics. We found that catecholamines, but not acetylcholine, altered both the temporal structure of intrinsic activity fluctuations in visual and parietal cortex, and the volatility of perceptual inference based on ambiguous visual input. Both effects indicate that catecholamines increase the net E/I ratio in visual and parietal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial inheritance, genome maintenance, and metabolic adaptation all depend on organelle fission by Dynamin-Related Protein 1 (DRP1) and its mitochondrial receptors. DRP1 receptors include the paralogs Mitochondrial Dynamics 49 and 51 (MID49/MID51) and Mitochondrial Fission Factor (MFF), but the mechanisms by which these proteins recruit DRP1 and regulate its activities are unknown. Here we present a cryoEM structure of human, full-length DRP1 bound to MID49 and an analysis of structure- and disease-based mutations. We report that GTP binding allosterically induces a remarkable elongation and rotation of the G-domain, Bundle-Signaling Element (BSE) and connecting hinge loops of DRP1. In this nucleotide-bound conformation, a distributed network of multivalent interactions promotes DRP1 copolymerization into a linear filament with MID49, MID51 or both. Subsequent GTP hydrolysis and exchange within the filament leads to receptor dissociation, shortening through disassembly, and concomitant curling of DRP1 oligomers into closed rings. The dimensions of the closed DRP1 rings are consistent with DRP1-constricted mitochondrial tubules observed in human cells. These structures are the first views of full-length, receptor- and nucleotide-bound dynamin-family GTPases and--in comparison with nucleotide-free crystal structures--teach us how these molecular machines perform mechanical work through nucleotide-driven allostery.",

    "abstract": "Inside the cell nucleus, genomes fold into organized structures that are characteristic of cell type. Here, we show that this chromatin architecture can be predicted de novo using epigenetic data derived from ChIP-Seq. We exploit the idea that chromosomes encode a one-dimensional sequence of chromatin structural types. Interactions between these chromatin types determine the three-dimensional (3D) structural ensemble of chromosomes through a process similar to phase separation. First, a recurrent neural network is used to infer the relation between the epigenetic marks present at a locus, as assayed by ChIP-Seq, and the genomic compartment in which those loci reside, as measured by DNA-DNA proximity ligation (Hi-C). Next, types inferred from this neural network are used as an input to an energy landscape model for chromatin organization (MiChroM) in order to generate an ensemble of 3D chromosome conformations. After training the model, dubbed MEGABASE (Maximum Entropy Genomic Annotation from Biomarkers Associated to Structural Ensembles), on odd numbered chromosomes, we predict the chromatin type sequences and the subsequent 3D conformational ensembles for the even chromosomes. We validate these structural ensembles by using ChIP-Seq tracks alone to predict Hi-C maps as well as distances measured using 3D FISH experiments. Both sets of experiments support the hypothesis of phase separation being the driving process behind compartmentalization. These findings strongly suggest that epigenetic marking patterns encode sufficient information to determine the global architecture of chromosomes and that de novo structure prediction for whole genomes may be increasingly possible.",

    "abstract": "p21WAF1/CIP1 is a broad-acting cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor. Its stability is essential for proper cell cycle progression and cell fate decision. Ubiquitylation by the multiple E3 ubiquitin ligases complex is the major regulatory mechanism of p21, which induces p21 degradation. However, it is unclear whether ubiquitylated p21 can be recycled. In this study, we report USP11 as a deubiquitylase of p21. In the nucleus, USP11 binds to p21, catalyzes the removal of polyubiquitin chains conjugated onto p21 and stabilizes p21 protein. As a result, USP11 reverses p21 polyubiquitylation and degradation mediated by SCFSKP2, CRL4CDT2 and APC/CCDT20 in a cell cycle-independent manner. Loss of USP11 causes the destabilization of p21 and induces the G1/S transition in unperturbed cells. Furthermore, p21 accumulation mediated by DNA damage is completely abolished in cells depleted of USP11, which results in abrogation of the G2 checkpoint and induction of apoptosis. Functionally, USP11-mediated stabilization of p21 inhibits cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vivo. These findings reveal an important mechanism by which p21 can be stabilized by direct deubiquitylation and pinpoint a crucial role of the USP11-p21 axis in regulating cell cycle progression and DNA damage responses.",

    "abstract": "The cAMP-Protein Kinase A signalling, anchored on CpkA, is necessary for appressorium development and host penetration, but indispensable for infectious growth in Magnaporthe oryzae. In this study, we identified and characterized the gene encoding the second catalytic subunit, CPK2, whose expression was found to be lower compared to CPKA at various stages of pathogenic growth in M. oryzae. Deletion of CPK2 caused no alterations in vegetative growth, conidiation, appressorium formation, or pathogenicity. Surprisingly, the cpkA{Delta}cpk2{Delta} double deletion strain displayed significant reduction in growth rate and conidiation compared to the single deletion mutants. Interestingly, loss of CPKA and CPK2 resulted in morphogenetic defects in germ tubes (with curled/wavy and serpentine growth pattern) on hydrophobic surfaces, and a complete failure to produce appressoria therein, thus suggesting an important role for CPK2-mediated cAMP-PKA in surface sensing and response pathway. CPKA promoter-driven CPK2 expression partially suppressed the defects in host penetration and pathogenicity in the cpkA{Delta}. Such ectopic CPK2 expressing strain successfully penetrated the rice leaves, but was unable to produce proper secondary invasive hyphae, thus underscoring the importance of CpkA in growth and differentiation in planta. The Cpk2-GFP localized to the nucleus and cytoplasmic vesicles in conidia and the germ tubes. The Cpk2-GFP colocalized with CpkA-mCherry on vesicles in the cytosol, but such overlap was not evident in the nucleus. Our studies indicate that CpkA and Cpk2 share overlapping functions, but also play distinct roles during pathogenesis-associated signalling and morphogenesis in the rice blast fungus.",

As overall litter size increases the probabilities of having 0, 1, or 2 adjacent foetuses of the opposite sex approaches and eventually settles at 0.25, 0.5, 0.25 respectively. However, at biologically-relevant litter sizes probabilities are more variable and the general effect of an increase in litter size is to increase the probability that any particular foetus will be flanked by two members of the opposite sex. When gender ratios within a uterine horn are no longer balanced, the probability that there are 0 adjacent foetuses of the opposite sex increases.",

    "abstract": "Walking is a complex rhythmic locomotor behaviour generated by sequential and periodical contraction of muscles essential for coordinated control of movements of legs and leg joints. Studies of walking in vertebrates and invertebrates have revealed that premotor neural circuitry generates a basic rhythmic pattern that is sculpted by sensory feedback and ultimately controls the amplitude and phase of the motor output to leg muscles. However, the identity and functional roles of the premotor interneurons that directly control leg motoneuron activity are poorly understood. Here we take advantage of the powerful genetic methodology available in Drosophila to investigate the role of premotor inhibition in walking by genetically suppressing inhibitory input to leg motoneurons. For this, we have developed a novel algorithm for automated analysis of leg motion to characterize the walking parameters of wildtype flies from high speed video recordings. Further, we use genetic reagents for targeted RNAi knockdown of inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors in leg motoneurons together with quantitative analysis of resulting changes in leg movement parameters in freely walking Drosophila. Our findings indicate that targeted downregulation of GABAA receptor Rdl in leg motoneurons results in a dramatic reduction of walking speed and step-length without the loss of general leg coordination during locomotion. Genetically restricting the knockdown to the adult stage and subsets of motoneurons yields qualitatively identical results. Taken together,these findings identify GABAergic premotor inhibition of motoneurons as an important determinant of correctly coordinated leg movements and speed of walking in freely behaving Drosophila.",

However, little is known about the metabolism of gossypol in cotton plant. Here, Detection on the dynamic tendency of gossypol content illustrated that at the germination stage, the main source of gossypol was cotyledon, and at the later stages, gossypol mainly came from root system. Plant grafting between cottons and sunflower proved that gossypol was mainly synthesized in the root systems of cotton plants and both of the glanded and glandless cottons had the ability of gossypol biosynthesis. Besides, the pigment glands expression was uncoupled with gossypol biosynthesis. Root tip and rootless seedling organ culture in vitro further revealed other parts of the seedlings also got the ability to synthesize gossypol except root system. Moreover, root system produced the racemic gossypol and plant synthesized the optically active gossypol. The expression profiling of key genes in the gossypol biosynthetic pathway suggested that downstream key genes had relatively high expression levels in root systems which confirmed that gossypol was mainly synthesized in the root systems. Taken together, our results helped to clarify the complex mechanism of gossypol metabolism.",

Our results show that, in the absence of BLM, sister chromatid exchanges in human and murine cells do not occur randomly throughout the genome but are strikingly enriched at coding regions, specifically at sites of putative guanine quadruplex (G4) motifs in transcribed genes.

We performed the largest genome-wide association study to date, including 20,352 cases and 31,358 controls of European descent, with follow-up analysis of 822 sentinel variants at loci with P<1x10-4 in an independent sample of 9,412 cases and 137,760 controls. In the combined analysis, 30 loci reached genome-wide significant evidence for association, of which 20 were novel. These significant loci contain genes encoding ion channels and neurotransmitter transporters (CACNA1C, GRIN2A, SCN2A, SLC4A1), synaptic components (RIMS1, ANK3), immune and energy metabolism components. Bipolar disorder type I (depressive and manic episodes; ~73% of our cases) is strongly genetically correlated with schizophrenia whereas bipolar disorder type II (depressive and hypomanic episodes; ~17% of our cases) is more strongly correlated with major depressive disorder. These findings address key clinical questions and provide potential new biological mechanisms for bipolar disorder.",

Here we report a meta-analysis of 11 nevus GWAS from Australia, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and United States, comprising a total of 52,506 phenotyped individuals. We confirm known loci including MTAP, PLA2G6, and IRF4, and detect novel SNPs at a genome-wide level of significance in KITLG, DOCK8, and a broad region of 9q32. In a bivariate analysis combining the nevus results with those from a recent melanoma GWAS meta-analysis (12,874 cases, 23,203 controls), SNPs near GPRC5A, CYP1B1, PPARGC1B, HDAC4, FAM208B and SYNE2 reached global significance, and other loci, including MIR146A and OBFC1, reached a suggestive level of significance. Overall, we conclude that most nevus genes affect melanoma risk (KITLG an exception), while many melanoma risk loci do not alter nevus count. For example, variants in TERC and OBFC1 affect both traits, but other telomere length maintenance genes seem to affect melanoma risk only. Our findings implicate multiple pathways in nevogenesis via genes we can show to be expressed under control of the MITF melanocytic cell lineage regulator.",

    "abstract": "The green sulfur bacteria (Chlorobiaceae) are anaerobes that use electrons from reduced sulfur compounds (sulfide, S(0), and thiosulfate) as electron donors for photoautotrophic growth. Chlorobaculum tepidum, the model system for the Chlorobiaceae, both produces and consumes extracellular S(0) globules depending on the availability of sulfide in the environment. These physiological changes imply significant changes in gene regulation, which has been observed when sulfide is added to Cba. tepidum growing on thiosulfate. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these gene expression changes, i.e. specific regulators and promoter elements involved, have not yet been defined. Here, differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) was used to globally identify transcript start sites (TSS) that were present during growth on sulfide, biogenic S(0), and thiosulfate as sole electron donors. TSS positions were used in combination with RNA-seq data from cultures growing on these same electron donors to identify both basal promoter elements and motifs associated with electron donor dependent transcriptional regulation. These motifs were conserved across homologous Chlorobiaceae promoters. Two lines of evidence suggest that sulfide mediated repression is the dominant regulatory mode in Cba. tepidum. First, motifs associated with genes regulated by sulfide overlap key basal promoter elements. Second, deletion of the gene CT1277, encoding a putative regulatory protein, leads to constitutive over-expression of the sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase CT1087 in the absence of sulfide. The results suggest that sulfide is the master regulator of sulfur metabolism in Cba. tepidum and the Chlorobiaceae. Finally, the identification of basal promoter elements with differing strengths will further the development of synthetic biology in Cba. tepidum and perhaps other Chlorobiaceae.\\n\\nImportanceElemental sulfur is a key intermediate in biogeochemical sulfur cycling. The photoautotrophic green sulfur bacterium Chlorobaculum tepidum both produces and consumes elemental sulfur depending on the availability of sulfide in the environment. Our results reveal transcriptional dynamics of Chlorobaculum tepidum on elemental sulfur, and increase our understanding of the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation governing growth on different reduced sulfur compounds. This study identifies new genes and sequence motifs that likely play significant roles in the production and consumption of elemental sulfur. Beyond this focused impact, this study paves the way for the development of synthetic biology in Chlorobaculum tepidum and other Chlorobiaceae by providing a comprehensive identification of promoter elements to control gene expression, a key element of strain engineering.",

    "abstract": "At least five gene clusters in the Geobacter sulfurreducens genome encode putative  electron conduits implicated in electron transfer across the outer membrane, each containing a periplasmic multiheme c-type cytochrome, integral outer membrane anchor, and outer membrane redox lipoprotein(s). Markerless single gene cluster deletions and all possible multiple deletion combinations were constructed and grown with soluble Fe(III) citrate, Fe(III)- and Mn(IV)-oxides, and graphite electrodes poised at +0.24 V and -0.1 V vs. SHE. Different gene clusters were necessary for reduction of each electron acceptor. During metal oxide reduction, deletion of the previously described omcBC cluster caused defects, but deletion of additional components in an {Delta}omcBC background, such as extEFG, were needed to produce defects greater than 50% compared to wild type. Deletion of all five gene clusters abolished all metal reduction. During electrode reduction, only the {Delta}extABCD mutant had a severe growth defect at both redox potentials, while this mutation did not affect Fe(III)-oxide, Mn(IV)-oxide, or Fe(III) citrate reduction. Some mutants containing only one cluster were able to reduce particular terminal electron acceptors better than wild type, suggesting routes for improvement by targeting specific electron transfer pathways. Transcriptomic comparisons between fumarate and electrode-based growth showed all of these ext clusters to be constitutive, and transcriptional analysis of the triple-deletion strain containing only extABCD detected no significant changes in expression of known redox proteins or pili components. These genetic experiments reveal new outer membrane conduit complexes necessary for growth of G. sulfurreducens, depending on the available extracellular electron acceptor.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1-infected people who take drugs that suppress viremia to undetectable levels are protected from developing AIDS. Nonetheless, these individuals have chronic inflammation associated with heightened risk of cardiovascular pathology. HIV-1 establishes proviruses in long-lived CD4+ memory T cells, and perhaps other cell types, that preclude elimination of the virus even after years of continuous antiviral therapy. Though the majority of proviruses that persist during antiviral therapy are defective for production of infectious virions, many are expressed, raising the possibility that the HIV-1provirus or its transcripts contribute to ongoing inflammation. Here we found that the HIV-1 provirus activated innate immune signaling in isolated dendritic cells, macrophages, and CD4+ T cells. Immune activation required transcription from the HIV-1 provirus and expression of CRM1-dependent, Rev-dependent, RRE-containing, unspliced HIV-1 RNA. If rev was provided in trans, all HIV-1 coding sequences were dispensable for activation except those cis-acting sequences required for replication or splicing. These results indicate that the complex, post-transcriptional regulation intrinsic to HIV-1 RNA is detected by the innate immune system as a danger signal, and that drugs which disrupt HIV-1 transcription or HIV-1 RNA metabolism would add qualitative benefit to current antiviral drug regimens.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death by an infectious disease, and global TB control efforts are increasingly threatened by drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Unlike most bacteria, where lateral gene transfer is an important mechanism of resistance acquisition, resistant M. tb arises solely by de novo chromosomal mutation. Using whole genome sequencing data from two natural populations of M. tb, we characterized the population genetics of known drug resistance loci using measures of diversity, population differentiation, and convergent evolution. We found resistant sub-populations to be less diverse than susceptible sub-populations, consistent with ongoing transmission of resistant M. tb. A subset of resistance genes (\\\"sloppy targets\\\") were characterized by high diversity and multiple rare variants; we posit that a large genetic target for resistance and relaxation of purifying selection contribute to high diversity at these loci. For \\\"tight targets\\\" of selection, the path to resistance appeared narrower, evidenced by single favored mutations that arose numerous times on the phylogeny and segregated at markedly different frequencies in resistant and susceptible sub-populations. These results suggest that diverse genetic architectures underlie drug resistance in M. tb, and combined approaches are needed to identify causal mutations. Extrapolating from patterns observed in well-characterized genes, we identified novel candidate variants involved in resistance. The approach outlined here can be extended to identify resistance variants for new drugs, to investigate the genetic architecture of resistance, and, when phenotypic data are available, to find candidate genetic loci underlying other positively selected traits in clonal bacteria.\\n\\nImportanceMycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is a significant burden on global health. Antibiotic treatment imposes strong selective pressure on M. tb populations. Identifying the mutations that cause drug resistance in M. tb is important for guiding TB treatment and halting the spread of drug resistance. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of M. tb isolates can be used to identify novel mutations mediating drug resistance and to predict resistance patterns faster than traditional methods of drug susceptibility testing. We have used WGS from natural populations of drug resistant M. tb to characterize effects of selection for advantageous mutations on patterns of diversity at genes involved in drug resistance. The methods developed here can be used to identify novel advantageous mutations, including new resistance loci, in M. tb and other clonal pathogens.",
