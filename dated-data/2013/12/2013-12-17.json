    "abstract": "Humans in many societies cooperate in economic experiments at much higher levels than would be expected if their goal was maximizing economic returns even when interactions are anonymous and one-shot. This is a puzzle because paying a cost to benefit another player in one-shot interactions has no direct benefit to the cooperator. This paper explores the logic of two competing evolutionary hypotheses to explain this behavior. The \\\"norm psychology\\\" hypothesis holds that a players choice of strategy is heavily influenced by socially-learned cultural norms. Its premise is that over the course of human evolutionary history, cultural norms varied considerably across human societies and through a process of gene-culture co-evolution, humans evolved mechanisms to learn and adopt the norms of their particular society. The \\\"evolutionary mismatch\\\" hypothesis holds that pro-social preferences evolved genetically in our hunter-gatherer past where one-shot anonymous interactions were rare and these evolved \\\"protocols\\\" for cooperation are misapplied in modern, laboratory, conditions. I compare these hypotheses by adopting a well-known model of the mismatch hypothesis. I show that the cooperation generated by the model is based on a flawed assumption - that the best thing to do is cooperate in a repeated game. I show that repeated games generate a great diversity of behavioral equilibria, in support of the norm psychology hypothesiss premise. When interaction is repeated, adopting local norms is a more evolutionarily successful strategy than automatically cooperating. If various groups are at different behavioral equilibria, then cultural selection between groups tends to select for cooperative behavior.",

    "abstract": "The diversity of populations in domestic species offer great opportunities to study genome response to selection. The recently published Sheep Hapmap dataset is a great example of characterization of the world wide genetic diversity in the Sheep. In this study, we re-analyzed the Sheep Hapmap dataset to identify selection signatures in worldwide Sheep populations. Compared to previous analyses, we make use of statistical methods that (i) take account of the hierarchical structure of sheep populations, (ii) make use of Linkage Disequilibrium information and (iii) focus specifically on either recent or older selection signatures. We show that this allows to pinpoint several new selection signatures in the sheep genome and to distinguish those related to modern breeding objectives and to earlier post-domestication constraints. The newly identified regions, together with the one previously identified, reveal the extensive genome response to selection on morphology, color and adaptation to new environments.",
