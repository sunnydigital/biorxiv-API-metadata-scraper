    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWTo assess the effect of anthropogenic activities on ecosystems, it is of prime importance to develop new tools enabling a rapid characterisation of ecological communities. Freshwater ecosystems are particularly impacted and threatened by human activities and need thorough attention to preserve their biodiversity and the ecological services they provide. Studying such ecosystems is generally difficult because the associated organisms are hard to sample and to monitor. We present a ready to use environmental metabarcoding diagnostic tool to characterise and monitor the freshwater malacofauna from water samples. The efficiency of this new tool was compared to a classical malacological survey at 19 sampled sites from 10 distinct rivers distributed over Corsica Island (France). Our eDNA monitoring tool demonstrated a remarkable ability to reconstitute the local malacofauna compared to the malacological survey, with 97.1% of species detection confirmed by both methods. The present tool successfully detected the 11 freshwater snail species previously reported in Corsica by malacological survey but was limited at the genus level for some species. Moreover, our malacological survey allowed an update of the local distribution of a wide diversity of freshwater snails including invasive species (i.e. Potamopyrgus antipodarum and Physa acuta) as well as snail hosts of pathogens of medical and veterinary importance (i.e. Bulinus truncatus and Galba truncatula).",

    "abstract": "The ability to compare sequential sensory inputs is crucial for solving many behavioral tasks. To understand the neuronal mechanisms underlying sequential decisions, we compared neuronal responses in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the lateral and medial intra-parietal (LIP and MIP) areas in monkeys trained to decide whether sequentially presented stimuli were from matching (M) or nonmatching (NM) categories. We found that PFC leads the M/NM decision process relying on nonlinear neuronal integration of sensory and mnemonic information, whereas LIP and MIP are more involved in sensory evaluation and motor planning, respectively. Furthermore, multi-module recurrent neural networks trained on the same task exhibited the key features of PFC and LIP encoding, including nonlinear integrative encoding in the PFC-like module which was crucial for M/NM decisions. Together, our results illuminate the relative functions of LIP, PFC, and MIP in sensory, cognitive and motor functions, and suggest that nonlinear integration of task-related variables in PFC is important for mediating sequential decisions.",

    "abstract": "Fear-generalization is a critical function for survival, in which an organism extracts information from a specific instantiation of a threat (e.g., the western diamondback rattlesnake in my front yard on Sunday) and learns to fear--and accordingly respond to--pertinent higher-order information (e.g., snakes live in my yard). Previous work investigating fear-conditioning in humans has used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to demonstrate that activity-patterns of stimuli from an aversively-conditioned category (CS+) are more similar to each other than those of a neutral category (CS-). Here we designed a three-phase (i.e., baseline, conditioned, extinction) experiment using fMRI and multiple aversively-conditioned categories to ask whether we would find only similarity increases within the CS+ categories or also an increase in similarity between the CS+ categories. Using representational similarity analysis, we correlated a set of models to activity-patterns underlying several regions of interest and found that, following fear-conditioning, between-category and within-category similarity increased for the CS+ categories in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and the right temporal pole (rTP). Activity patterns in the object-selective lateral occipital cortex tended to prefer the semantic model, regardless of the experimental phase. These results advance prior pattern-based neuroimaging work by exploring the effect of aversively-conditioning multiple categories and indicate an extended role for the SFG and rTP in potentially linking discrete information or abstractly representing supracategorical information during fear-learning for the purpose of proper generalization.",

    "abstract": "Loss of function mutations at the retinoblastoma (RB1) gene are associated with increased mortality, metastasis and poor therapeutic outcome in several cancers, including osteosarcoma (OS). However, the mechanism(s) through which RB1 loss worsens clinical outcome remain to be elucidated. Ubiquitin-like with PHD and Ring Finger domains 1 (UHRF1) has been identified as a critical downstream effector of the RB/E2F signaling pathway that is overexpressed in various cancers. Here, we show that UHRF1 upregulation is critical in rendering OS cells more aggressive. Using novel OS genetically engineered mouse models, we determined that knocking-out Uhrf1 considerably reverses the poorer survival associated with Rb1 loss. We also found that high UHRF1 expression correlates with increased clinical presentation of metastatic disease. Based on gain- and loss-of-function assays, we found that UHRF1 promotes cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis. UHRF1-mediated cell mobility results as a consequence of altered extracellular vesicles and their cargo, including urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). Our work presents a new mechanistic insight into RB1 loss-associated poor prognosis and a novel oncogenic role of UHRF1 through regulation of exosome secretion that is critical for OS metastasis. This study provides substantial support for targeting UHRF1 or its downstream effectors as novel therapeutic options to improve current treatment for OS.",

Twenty-three healthy control subjects were included for comparison. A k-means clustering approach segmented the thalamus into regions representing nine major nuclei. Volume, fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity of nuclei were compared between cognitive groups and the relationship with cognitive domain z-scores investigated using hierarchical Bayesian regression models.\n\nResultsThere was an overall progressive increase in mean diffusivity as cognition deteriorated (PDN: 1.4 {micro}m2/s (95% uncertainty interval [0.2, 2.7]), PDMCI: 2.4 {micro}m2/s [0.8,4.0], PDD: 4.5 {micro}m2/s [2.8, 6.3]). The largest increase was in the lateral dorsal nucleus (PDN: 0.3 {micro}m2/s [-6.7, 7.2], PDMCI: 5.4 {micro}m2/s [-4.7, 16.1], PDD: 14.8 {micro}m2/s [5.0, 25.0]).

Increase in mean diffusivity of the thalamus is associated with a global decline in cognition, the magnitude of the effect was greatest in lateral dorsal nucleus. Fractional anisotropy only showed evidence of a relationship with cognitive domain scores in the lateral dorsal nucleus.\n\nConclusionsThe relationship between lateral dorsal nucleus integrity and cognitive changes is likely due to its primary connectivity with frontal and temporal regions.",

Recent studies have indicated that oligodendrocytes that survive demyelination can also contribute to remyelination, including in MS, but it is unclear how remyelination by surviving oligodendrocytes compares to that of newly generated oligodendrocytes. Here we studied oligodendrocytes in MS, and also imaged remyelination in vivo by surviving and new oligodendrocytes using zebrafish. We define a previously unappreciated pathology in MS, myelination of neuronal cell bodies, which is recapitulated during remyelination by surviving oligodendrocytes in zebrafish. Live imaging also revealed that surviving oligodendrocytes make very few new sheaths, but can support sheath growth along axons. In comparison, newly made oligodendrocytes make abundant new sheaths, properly targeted to axons, and exhibit a much greater capacity for regeneration.",

Here, we analyzed intracerebral EEG from 11 epileptic patients viewing a stimulus sequence beginning with a neutral face with direct gaze. The gaze could avert or remain direct, while the emotion changed to fearful or happy. N200 field potential peak latencies indicated that face processing begins in inferior occipital cortex and proceeds anteroventrally to fusiform and inferior temporal cortices, in parallel. The superior temporal sulcus responded preferentially to gaze changes with augmented field potential amplitudes for averted versus direct gaze, and large effect sizes relative to other network regions. An overlap analysis of posterior white matter tractography endpoints (from 1066 healthy brains) relative to active intracerebral electrodes in the 11 patients showed likely involvement of both dorsal and ventral posterior white matter pathways. Overall, our data provide new insight on the timing of face and social cue processing in the occipito-temporal brain and anchor the superior temporal cortex in dynamic gaze processing.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are overlapping neurodegenerative diseases that are increasingly understood to have long prodromal periods. Investigation of these early stages promises to yield valuable biomarkers of disease and will be key to understanding mechanisms underlying the genesis of ALS-FTD. Here, we use in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), histology and computed tomography to identify structural and cellular readouts of early stage disease in the TDP-43Q331K knock-in mouse model of ALS-FTD. Adult mutant mice demonstrated parenchymal volume reductions affecting the frontal lobe and entorhinal cortex in a manner reminiscent of ALS-FTD. Subcortical, cerebellar and brain stem regions were also affected in line with observations in presymptomatic carriers of mutations in C9orf72, the commonest genetic cause of both ALS and FTD. Volume loss, as measured by MRI, was also observed in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, along with ventricular enlargement. Guided by these imaging findings, detailed post-mortem brain tissue analysis revealed reduced parvalbumin-positive (PV+) interneurons as a potential cellular correlate of MRI changes in mutant mice. By contrast, microglia were in a disease activated state even in the absence of brain volume loss. A reduction in immature neurons was found in the DG, indicative of impaired adult neurogenesis, while a paucity of PV+ interneurons in juvenile mutant mice (P14) suggests that TDP-43Q331K disrupts neurodevelopment. Computerised tomography imaging also showed altered skull morphology in mutants, further suggesting a role for TDP-43Q331K in development. Finally, analysis of human post-mortem prefrontal cortices confirmed a paucity of PV+ interneurons in the prefrontal cortex in cases with both sporadic ALS and ALS linked to C9orf72 mutations. This study suggests an important role for PV+ interneurons in regional brain vulnerability associated with ALS-FTD, and identifies novel MRI and histological biomarkers that will be of value in assessing the efficacy of putative therapeutics in TDP-43Q331K knock-in mice.",

Utility is the hypothetical variable that appears to be maximized by the choice. Despite the generally accepted notion that utility functions are not insensitive to external references, the exact occurrence of such changes remains largely unknown. Here we benefitted from the capacity to perform thorough and extensive experimental tests of one of our evolutionary closest, experimentally viable and intuitively understandable species, the rhesus macaque monkey. Data from thousands of binary choices demonstrated that the animals preferences changed dependent on the statistics of recently experienced rewards and adapted to future expected rewards. The elicited utility functions shifted and extended their shape with several months of changes in the mean and range of reward distributions. However, the adaptations were usually not complete, suggesting that past experiences remained present when anticipating future rewards. Through modelling, we found that reinforcement learning provided a strong basis for explaining these adaptations. Thus, rather than having stable and fixed preferences assumed by normative economic models, rhesus macaques flexibly shaped their preferences to optimize decision-making according to the statistics of the environment.",

    "abstract": "In the developing central nervous system, electrical signaling is thought to rely exclusively on differentiating neurons as they acquire the ability to generate action potentials. Accordingly, the neuroepithelial progenitors (NEPs) giving rise to all neurons and glial cells during development have been reported to remain electrically passive. Here, we investigated the physiological properties of NEPs in the mouse spinal cord at the onset of spontaneous neural activity (SNA) initiating motor behavior in embryos. Using patch-clamp recordings, we discovered that spinal NEPs exhibit spontaneous membrane depolarizations during episodes of SNA. These recurrent depolarizations exhibited a ventral-to-dorsal gradient with the highest amplitude located in the floor-plate - the ventral-most part of the neuroepithelium. Paired-recordings revealed that NEPs are extensively coupled via gap-junctions and form a single electrical syncytium. Although other NEPs were electrically passive, we discovered that floor-plate NEPs have the unique ability to generate large Na+/Ca++ action potentials. Unlike neurons, floor-plate action potentials relied primarily on the activation of voltage-gated T-type calcium channels (TTCCs). In situ hybridization showed that all 3 known subtypes of TTCCs are highly and predominantly expressed in the floor-plate. During SNA, we found that acetylcholine released by motoneurons recurrently trigger floor-plate action potentials by acting through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Finally, by expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f in the floor plate, we demonstrated that neuroepithelial action potentials are associated with calcium waves and propagate along the entire length of the spinal cord. By unraveling a novel physiological mechanism generating electrical signals which can propagate independently from neurons across a neural structure, our work significantly changes our understanding of the development, origin and extent of electrical signaling in the central nervous system.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LISpinal neuroepithelial progenitors (NEP) are depolarized during spontaneous neural activity\nC_LIO_LINEPs form a single electrical syncytium connected by gap junctions\nC_LIO_LIFloor-plate NEPs generate large Na+/Ca++ action potentials in response to acetylcholine\nC_LIO_LINeuroepithelial action potentials propagate across the entire spinal cord\nC_LI",

Although most pre-mRNA processing reactions are thought to occur in the nucleus, numerous splicing regulators are also found in neurites. Here, we show that U1-70K/SNRNP70, a major spliceosomal component, localizes in RNA-associated granules in axons. We identify the cytoplasmic pool of SNRNP70 as an important local regulator of motor axonal growth, nerve-dependent acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering and neuromuscular synaptogenesis. This cytoplasmic pool has a protective role for a limited number of axonal transcripts preventing them from degradation. Moreover, non-nuclear SNRNP70 is able to locally regulates splice variants of transcripts such as agrin, thereby locally controlling formation of synapses. Our results point to an unexpected, yet essential, function of local SNRNP70 in axonal development and indicate a role of splicing factors in local RNA metabolism during establishment and maintenance of neuronal connectivity.",

First, the focus is solely on detection of non-zero signal or signal change, a problem that is exasperated for large scale studies (e.g. UK Biobank, N = 40, 000+) where the  null hypothesis fallacy causes even trivial effects to be determined as significant. Second, for any sample size, widely used cluster inference methods only indicate regions where a null hypothesis can be rejected, without providing any notion of spatial uncertainty about the activation. In this work, we address these issues by developing spatial Confidence Sets (CSs) on clusters found in thresholded Cohens d effect size images. We produce an upper and lower CS to make confidence statements about brain regions where Cohens d effect sizes have exceeded and fallen short of a non-zero threshold, respectively. The CSs convey information about the magnitude and reliability of effect sizes that is usually given separately in a t-statistic and effect estimate map. We expand the theory developed in our previous work on CSs for %BOLD change effect maps (Bowring et al., 2019) using recent results from the bootstrapping literature. By assessing the empirical coverage with 2D and 3D Monte Carlo simulations resembling fMRI data, we find our method is accurate in sample sizes as low as N = 60. We compute Cohens d CSs for the Human Connectome Project working memory taskfMRI data, illustrating the brain regions with a reliable Cohens d response for a given threshold. By comparing the CSs with results obtained from a traditional statistical voxelwise inference, we highlight the improvement in activation localization that can be gained with the Confidence Sets.",

    "abstract": "Music can induce strong subjective experience of emotions, but it is debated whether these responses engage the same neural circuits as emotions elicited by biologically significant events. We examined the functional neural basis of music-induced emotions in a large sample (n=102) of subjects who listened to emotionally engaging (happy, sad, fearful, and tender) pieces of instrumental music while their haemodynamic brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Ratings of the four categorical emotions and liking were used to predict haemodynamic responses in general linear model (GLM) analysis of the fMRI data. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was used to reveal discrete neural signatures of the four categories of music-induced emotions. To map neural circuits governing non-musical emotions, the subjects were scanned while viewing short emotionally evocative film clips. The GLM revealed that most emotions were associated with activity in the auditory, somatosensory and motor cortices, cingulate gyrus, insula, and precuneus. Fear and liking also engaged the amygdala. In contrast, the film clips strongly activated limbic and cortical regions implicated in emotional processing. MVPA revealed that activity in the auditory cortex in particular as well as in the primary motor cortices reliably discriminated the emotion categories. Our results indicate that different music-induced basic emotions have distinct representations in regions supporting auditory processing, motor control, somatosensation and interoception but do not strongly rely on limbic and medial prefrontal regions critical for emotions with survival value.",

    "abstract": "The human brain selectively stores knowledge of the world to optimise future behaviour, automatically rehearsing, contextualising or discarding information to create a robust record of experiences. Storage or forgetting evolves over time, particularly during sleep. We have previously shown that dopamine given in the form of L-DOPA tablets improves long-term memory in Parkinsons disease, but only when given overnight. L-DOPA is already prescribed widely with a good safety profile and could potentially be rapidly repurposed to improve cognitive performance and improve quality of life in, for example, early Alzheimers Disease, if we understood the best time of day to prescribe. Therefore, we sought to test how dopamine shaped long-term memory formation before and during sleep in a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled cross-over trial of healthy older adults (n = 35). We administered L-DOPA after word-list learning to be active during repeat exposure to a proportion of the words and during subsequent nocturnal sleep. Nocturnal dopamine accelerated forgetting for words presented once but it did not affect memory for words presented twice. During slow wave sleep, L-DOPA also increased spindle amplitude around slow oscillation peaks. Larger dopamine-induced difference in word memory was associated with a larger increase in spindle amplitude. Dopamine-dependent memory processing may therefore modulate spindles dependent on slow-oscillation phase. Further, overnight dopamine increased total slow wave sleep duration by approximately 11%. This pharmaceutical modification of slow wave sleep may have potential health-enhancing benefits in old age that could include cognitive enhancement and Alzheimers prevention.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryDopamine before sleep promotes forgetting of weak memory traces associated with increased spindle amplitude around the peak of a slow oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions require the brain to make categorical choices based on accumulated sensory evidence. The underlying computations have been studied using either phenomenological drift diffusion models or neurobiological network models exhibiting winner-take-all attractor dynamics. Although both classes of models can account for a large body of experimental data, it remains unclear to what extent their dynamics are qualitatively equivalent. Here we show that, unlike the drift diffusion model, the attractor model can operate in different integration regimes: an increase in the stimulus fluctuations or the stimulus duration promotes transitions between decision-states leading to a crossover between weighting mostly early evidence (primacy regime) to weighting late evidence (recency regime). Between these two limiting cases, we found a novel regime, which we name flexible categorization, in which fluctuations are strong enough to reverse initial categorizations, but only if they are incorrect. This asymmetry in the reversing probability results in a non-monotonic psychometric curve, a novel and distinctive feature of the attractor model. Finally, we show psychophysical evidence for the crossover between integration regimes predicted by the attractor model and for the relevance of this new regime. Our findings point to correcting transitions as an important yet overlooked feature of perceptual decision making.",

    "abstract": "Neurobiological research focuses on a small number of model organisms, broadening the pool of animals used in research may lead to important insights into the evolution of nervous systems. The ctenophore is emerging as a promising model, but we are currently lacking an understanding into the relationship between behaviour and environment which is in part due to a lack of a standardised long-term laboratory husbandry system. We established a collection and husbandry system for wild caught Pleurobrachia pileus. We examined the behavioural profile of the animals over time in this controlled environment. We could reliably catch them on a seasonal basis, and we could keep the animals alive in our specialised aquarium system for months at a time. P. pileus spends most of the time in an inactive  drifting state which is interspersed with periods of one of 5 active behaviours. The most common active behaviours are tentacle resetting and feeding. The longest duration behaviours include swimming up or down. Time of day does not appear to alter their behavioural profile. Gaining a better understanding of the behaviour of these animals has important implications for systems and evolutionary neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Excessive progesterone (PRG) may increase breast cancer risk under hormone therapy during postmenopause or hormonal contraception. As a sex steroid hormone, PRG exerts its cellular responses through signaling cascades involving classic (genomic), non-classic (non-genomic), or both combined responses by binding to either classic nuclear PRG receptors or non-classic membrane PRG receptors. Currently, the intricate balance and switch mechanisms between these two signaling cascades remain elusive. Three genes, KRIT1 (CCM1), MGC4607 (CCM2), and PDCD10 (CCM3), have been demonstrated to form a CCM signaling complex (CSC). In this report, we discover that the CSC plays an essential role in coupling both classic and non-classic PRG signaling pathways by mediating crosstalk between them. The coupled signaling pathways were detailed through high throughput omics.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe discover a novel signaling network among the CCM signaling complex (CSC), classic and non-classic progesterone receptors, and their ligands-progesterone/mifepristone, is dynamically modulated and fine-tuned with a series of feedback regulations; perturbation of this intricate balance, such as hormone therapy in the postmenopause or hormonal contraception regimen, or perturbed CSC signaling could result in increased risks in breast cancer or compromising tumor therapy.",

Here, in two independent groups of 40 participants, we examined the interaction effects of conflict processing in both unimodal (visual) and crossmodal (visual and auditory) dual-conflict paradigms (flanker conflict processing in Task 1 and then in the following Task 2) with a manipulation of the stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA). In both the unimodal and the crossmodal dual-conflict paradigms, the conflict processing of Task 1 interfered with the conflict processing of Task 2 when the SOA was short, reflecting an additive interference effect of Task 1 on Task 2 under the time constraints. These results suggest that there is a unified entity that oversees conflict processing acting supramodally by implementing comparable mechanisms in unimodal and crossmodal scenarios.",

Eighty-six participants underwent behavioural testing and watched one of 10 full-length movies while functional magnetic resonance imaging was acquired. Resulting timeseries data are shown to be of high quality, with good signal-to-noise ratio, few outliers and low movement. Data-driven functional analyses provide further evidence of data quality.

The NNDb can be used to answer questions previously unaddressed with standard neuroimaging approaches, progressing our knowledge of how the brain works in the real world.",

Decision-making strategies evolve over the course of learning, and continue to vary even in well-trained animals.

Here, we present a flexible method for characterizing time-varying behavior during decision-making experiments. We show that it successfully captures trial-to-trial changes in an animals sensitivity to not only task-relevant stimuli, but also task-irrelevant covariates such as choice, reward, and stimulus history. We use this method to derive insights from training data collected in mice, rats, and human subjects performing auditory discrimination and visual detection tasks. With this approach, we uncover the detailed evolution of an animals strategy during learning, including adaptation to time-varying task statistics, suppression of sub-optimal strategies, and shared behavioral dynamics between subjects within an experimental population.",

Expert programmers (average 11 years of programming experience) performed code comprehension and memory control tasks while undergoing fMRI. The same participants also performed language, math, formal logic, and executive control localizer tasks. A left-lateralized fronto-parietal network was recruited for code comprehension. Patterns of activity within this network distinguish between \"for\" loops and \"if\" conditional code functions. Code comprehension overlapped extensively with neural basis of formal logic and to a lesser degree math. Overlap with simpler executive processes and language was low, but laterality of language and code covaried across individuals.

    "abstract": "The visual systems of teleost fishes usually match their habitats and lifestyles. Since coral reefs are bright and colourful environments, the visual systems of their diurnal inhabitants have been more extensively studied than those of nocturnal species. In order to fill this knowledge gap, we conducted a detailed investigation of the visual systems of the coral reef fish family Holocentridae (squirrelfish and soldierfish). In addition to their nocturnality, this family is particularly interesting for dim-light vision studies due to its ecological and evolutionary connection to deeper habitats. Results showed that the visual system of holocentrids is well adapted to their nocturnal lifestyle with a rod-dominated retina. Surprisingly, rods in all species were arranged into 6-17 well-defined banks, a feature most commonly found in deep-sea fishes, that may increase the light sensitivity of the eye and/or allow colour discrimination in dim-light. Holocentrids also have the potential for dichromatic colour vision during the day with the presence of at least two spectrally different cone types: single cones expressing the blue-sensitive SWS2A gene, and double cones expressing one or two green-sensitive RH2 genes. Some differences were observed between the two subfamilies, with Holocentrinae having a slightly more developed photopic visual system than Myripristinae. Moreover, retinal topography of both ganglion cells and cone photoreceptors showed specific patterns for each cell type, likely highlighting different visual demands at different times of the day, such as feeding. Overall, their well-developed scotopic visual systems and the ease of catching and maintaining holocentrids in aquaria, make them ideal models to investigate teleost dim-light vision and more particularly shed light on the function of multibank retina and its potential for dim-light colour vision.",

    "abstract": "The leucine-rich repeat-containing family 8 member A (LRRC8A) is an essential subunit of the volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC). VRAC is critical for cell volume control, but its broader physiological functions remain under investigation. Recent studies in the field indicate that Lrrc8a disruption in brain astrocytes reduces neuronal excitability, impairs synaptic plasticity and memory, and protects against cerebral ischemia. In the present work, we generated the brain-wide conditional LRRC8A knock-out mice (LRRC8A bKO) using NestinCre-driven Lrrc8aflox/flox excision in neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendroglia. LRRC8A bKO animals were born close to the expected Mendelian ratio and developed without overt histological abnormalities, but, surprisingly, all died between 5 and 9 weeks of age with a seizure phenotype, which was confirmed by video and EEG recordings. Brain slice electrophysiology detected changes in the excitability of pyramidal cells and modified GABAergic inputs in the hippocampal CA1 region of LRRC8A bKO. LRRC8A-null hippocampi showed increased immunoreactivity of the astrocytic marker GFAP, indicating reactive astrogliosis. We also found decreased whole-brain protein levels of the GABA transporter GAT-1, the glutamate transporter GLT-1, and the astrocytic enzyme glutamine synthetase. Complementary HPLC assays identified reduction in the tissue levels of the glutamate and GABA precursor glutamine. Together, these findings suggest that VRAC provides vital control of brain excitability in mouse adolescence. VRAC deletion leads to a lethal phenotype involving progressive astrogliosis and dysregulation of astrocytic uptake and supply of amino acid neurotransmitters and their precursors.",

    "abstract": "The perception and measurement of spatial and temporal dimensions have been widely studied. However, whether these two dimensions are processed independently is still being debated. Additionally, whether EEG components are uniquely associated with time or space, or whether they reflects a more general measure of magnitude remains unknown. While undergoing EEG, subjects traveled a randomly predetermined spatial or temporal interval and were then instructed to reproduce the interval traveled. In the task, the subjects travel speed varied for the estimation and reproduction phases of each trial, so that one dimension could not inform the other. Behaviorally, subject performance was more variable when reproducing time than space, but overall, just as accurate; notably, behavior was not correlated between tasks. EEG data revealed during estimation the contingent negative variation (CNV) tracked the probability of the upcoming interval, regardless of dimension. However, during reproduction, the CNV exclusively oriented to the upcoming temporal interval at the start of reproduction. Further, a dissociation between relatively early frontal beta and late posterior alpha oscillations was observed for time and space reproduction, respectively. Our findings indicate that time and space are neurally separable dimensions, yet are hierarchically organized across task contexts within the CNV signal.",

    "abstract": "The mounting evidence for the involvement of astrocytes in neuronal circuits function and behavior stands in stark contrast to the lack of detailed anatomical description of these cells and the neurons in their domains. To fill this void, we imaged >30,000 astrocytes in cleared hippocampi, and employed converging genetic, histological and computational tools to determine the elaborate structure, distribution and neuronal content of astrocytic domains. First, we characterized the spatial distribution of >19,000 astrocytes across CA1 lamina, and analyzed the detailed morphology of thousands of reconstructed domains. We then determined the excitatory content of CA1 astrocytes, averaging above 13 pyramidal neurons per domain and increasing towards CA1 midline. Finally, we discovered that somatostatin neurons are found in close proximity to astrocytes, compared to parvalbumin and VIP inhibitory neurons. This resource expands our understanding of fundamental hippocampal design principles, and provides the first quantitative foundation for neuron-astrocyte interactions in this region.",

Previous LFM studies have imaged GEVIs to track population-level interactions only in invertebrate preparations and without single cell resolution. Here we demonstrate sub-cellular resolution GEVI light field imaging in acute mouse brain slices resolving dendritic voltage signals localized in three dimensions. We characterize the effects of different light field reconstruction techniques on the SNR and signal localization and compare the SNR to fluorescence transients imaged in wide field.

    "abstract": "The consolidation of motor memory is a non-linear temporal dynamic. There are critical time points at which post-training performance can improve (e.g., 30 min and 24 h) or merely stabilize (e.g., 4 h). Besides, neuronal plasticity is supported by synchronized oscillatory activity in and between brain areas at play during the acquisition and consolidation of motor skills. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) can entrain cortical oscillatory activity, which may eventually modulate brain plasticity-related processes. Previous reports suggest that 20 Hz electrical stimulation over the primary motor cortex (M1) following training facilitates the consolidation of motor memories. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of tACS was not investigated when applied at critical post-training time points, nor its impact at longer time scales. In the present study, we investigated the effect of 20 Hz tACS applied over M1 within critical time periods (25min vs. 4h) on motor memory consolidation at immediate and delayed (24h) retrieval. Performance similarly evolved over time in all conditions, independently from the stimulation type (20 Hz tACS vs. Sham tACS) or the stimulation time point. As it stands, our results do not support the proposal that 20 Hz tACS exerts a positive, specific effect on the consolidation of motor memories.",

    "abstract": "Sudoku is a popular leisure time activity that involves no math, but is based on logic based combinatorial number placement in a matrix. Many studies have been dedicated towards finding an algorithm to solve Sudoku but investigation of the neural substrates involved in Sudoku has been challenging. It is difficult to measure the brain activity during 9x9 Sudoku using traditional fMRI technique due to the procedural constraints. 16 optodes fNIRS (functional near infrared spectroscopy) forms an excellent alternative to study the activity of prefrontal cortex (PFC) during Sudoku task. Sudoku task was divided into two steps to understand the differential function of the PFC while applying heuristic rules. Classical two-way ANOVA as well as General Linear Model based approach was used to analyze the data. 28-noise free recording from right-handed participants revealed increased activity in all 16 optode locations during step 1 (3 x 3 subgrids) and step 2 (easy level 9x9 Sudoku) as compared to rest. Contrasting the step2-step1 revealed that medial regions of PFC were preferentially activated. These findings suggest the role of these regions, while applying multiple heuristic rules to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzle.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/115121v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@88c44eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1100737org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@149b4a1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f1d055_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIThis is first fNIRS study that tried to unravel the role of PFC during Sudoku task.\nC_LIO_LIUniquely divided the Sudoku task into two steps to understand the differential role of PFC while applying multiple heuristic rules.\nC_LIO_LIBoth the medial and lateral regions of PFC are activated during Sudoku task.\nC_LIO_LIHowever, the medial regions of PFC play a differential role, especially when we consider the row and the column rule of Sudoku.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Bj[a]nes DA, Fisher LE, Gaunt RA, Weber DJHeuristic Spike Sorting Tuner (HSST), a framework to determine optimal parameter selection for a generic spike sorting algorithm. bioRxiv First published May 21, 2020. Extracellular microelectrodes frequently record neural activity from more than one neuron in the vicinity of the electrode. The process of labeling each recorded spike waveform with the identity of its source neuron is called spike sorting and is often approached from an abstracted statistical perspective. However, these approaches do not consider neurophysiological realities and may ignore important features that could improve the accuracy of these methods. Further, standard algorithms typically require selection of at least one free parameter, which can have significant effects on the quality of the output. We describe a Heuristic Spike Sorting Tuner (HSST) that determines the optimal choice of the free parameters for a given spike sorting algorithm based on the neurophysiological qualification of unit isolation and signal discrimination. A set of heuristic metrics are used to score the output of a spike sorting algorithm over a range of free parameters resulting in optimal sorting quality. We demonstrate that these metrics can be used to tune parameters in several spike sorting algorithms. The HSST algorithm shows robustness to variations in signal to noise ratio, number and relative size of units per channel. Moreover, the HSST algorithm is computationally efficient, operates unsupervised, and is parallelizable for batch processing.\n\nNEW & NOTEWORTHYHSST incorporates known neurophysiological priors of extracellular neural recordings while simultaneously taking advantage of powerful abstract mathematical tools. Rather than simply selecting free parameters prior to running a sorting algorithm, HSST executes a sorting algorithm across a range of input parameters, using heuristic metrics to detect which spike-sorting output is most physiologically plausible. This novel approach enables unsupervised spike-sorting exceeding the performance of previous methods, thereby enabling the processing of large data sets with confidence.",

To gain insight into its neural basis, we recorded responses of single neurons in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) while rhesus macaques performed a task that induces and quantifies demand for information. We find that enhanced firing rates in dACC before the start of a trial predict a stronger bias towards information-seeking choices. Following choices of uninformative options, firing rates are tonically enhanced until information is delivered. The level of enhancement observed is correlated on a trial-by-trial basis with the value assigned to the prospective information. Finally, variation in this tone is positively correlated with receptiveness to new information, as inferred by preference changes on subsequent trials. These patterns are not observed in a complementary dataset collected in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), suggesting these effects reflect at least somewhat anatomically localized processing.",

The association of stages duration with the stimulus coherency and spatial prioritization factors also revealed the importance of the evidence accumulation process on the speed of the whole decision-making process.

    "abstract": "Many risky choices we make affect others in addition to ourselves, and choices made by others also affect us. To study the neural mechanisms underlying social responsibility, we used the following social decision paradigm. In each trial, participants or their game partner chose between a safe and a risky option in a gamble for money. If the risky option was chosen, the gamble was played out independently for both players, such that both could either win or lose the gamble. Participants reported their momentary happiness after experiencing the outcomes of the gambles. Responsibility influenced happiness: ratings were lower following negative outcomes resulting from participants rather than their partners choices. The findings of this first behavioural study were replicated in a separate participant sample in the second neuroimaging study. Insula activation was larger in response to negative social outcomes resulting from participants rather than their partners choices. A computational modelling-based analysis of these data revealed a cluster of voxels in left superior temporal sulcus whose activation fluctuated with reward prediction errors experienced by the game partner, but to a degree that varied depending on who made the choices leading to these prediction errors. These results suggest that the anterior insula and the superior temporal sulcus play complementary roles in the neural mechanisms of social responsibility.",

    "abstract": "Microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS), are dynamic cells, constantly extending and retracting their processes as they contact and functionally regulate neurons and other glial cells. There is far less known about microglia-vascular interactions, particularly under healthy steady-state conditions. Here, we use the male and female mouse cerebral cortex to show that a higher percentage of microglia associate with the vasculature during the first week of postnatal development compared to older ages and the timing of these associations are dependent on the fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1). Similar developmental microglia-vascular associations were detected in the prenatal human brain. Using live imaging in mice, we found that juxtavascular microglia migrated when microglia are actively colonizing the cortex and became stationary by adulthood to occupy the same vascular space for nearly 2 months. Further, juxtavascular microglia at all ages contact vascular areas void of astrocyte endfeet and the developmental shift in microglial migratory behavior along vessels corresponded to when astrocyte endfeet more fully ensheath vessels. Together, our data provide a comprehensive assessment of microglia-vascular interactions. They support a mechanism by which microglia use the vasculature to migrate within the developing brain parenchyma. This migration becomes restricted upon the arrival of astrocyte endfeet when juxtavascular microglia then establish a long-term, stable contact with the vasculature.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe report the first extensive analysis of juxtavascular microglia in the healthy, developing and adult brain. Live imaging revealed that juxtavascular microglia within the cortex are highly motile and migrate along vessels as they are colonizing cortical regions. Using confocal, expansion, super-resolution, and electron microscopy, we determined that microglia associate with the vasculature at all ages in areas lacking full coverage astrocyte endfoot coverage and motility of juxtavascular microglia ceases as astrocyte endfeet more fully ensheath the vasculature. Our data lay the fundamental groundwork to investigate microglia-astrocyte crosstalk and juxtavascular microglial function in the healthy and diseased brain. They further provide a potential vascular-dependent mechanism by which microglia colonize the brain to later regulate neural circuit development.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI techniques are widely used to study in vivo changes in the human brain connectome. However, to resolve and characterise white matter fibres in heterogeneous diffusion MRI voxels remains a challenging problem typically approached with signal models that rely on prior information and restrictive constraints. We have recently introduced a 5D relaxation-diffusion correlation framework wherein multidimensional diffusion encoding strategies are used to acquire data at multiple echo-times in order to increase the amount of information encoded into the signal and ease the constraints needed for signal inversion. Nonparametric Monte Carlo inversion of the resulting datasets yields 5D relaxation-diffusion distributions where contributions from different sub-voxel tissue environments are separated with minimal assumptions on their microscopic properties. Here, we build on the 5D correlation approach to derive fibre-specific metrics that can be mapped throughout the imaged brain volume. Distribution components ascribed to fibrous tissues are resolved, and subsequently mapped to a dense mesh of overlapping orientation bins in order to define a smooth orientation distribution function (ODF). Moreover, relaxation and diffusion measures are correlated to each independent ODF coordinate, thereby allowing the estimation of orientation-specific relaxation rates and diffusivities. The proposed method is tested on a healthy volunteer, where the estimated ODFs were observed to capture major WM tracts, resolve fibre crossings, and, more importantly, inform on the relaxation and diffusion features along distinct fibre bundles. If combined with fibre-tracking algorithms, the methodology presented in this work may be useful for investigating the microstructural properties along individual white matter pathways.",

    "abstract": "The circadian and endocrine systems influence many physiological processes in animals, but little is known on the ways they interact in insects. We tested the hypothesis that juvenile hormone (JH) influences circadian rhythms in the social bumble bee Bombus terrestris. JH is the major gonadotropin in this species coordinating processes such as vitellogenesis, oogenesis, wax production, and behaviors associated with reproduction. It is unknown however, whether it also influences circadian processes. We topically treated newly-emerged bees with the allatoxin Precocene-I (P-I) to reduce circulating JH titers and applied the natural JH (JH-III) for replacement therapy. We repeated this experiment in three trials, each with bees from different source colonies. Measurements of ovarian activity confirmed that our JH manipulations were effective; bees treated with P-I had inactive ovaries, and this effect was fully reverted by subsequent JH treatment. We found that JH augments the strength of circadian rhythms and the pace of rhythm development in individually isolated newly emerged worker bees. JH manipulation did not affect the free-running circadian period, overall level of locomotor activity, or the amount of sleep. Given that acute manipulation at an early age produced relatively long-lasting effects, we propose that JH effect on circadian rhythms is mostly organizational, accelerating the development or integration of the circadian system.",

Here, we combine a novel behavioral assay with the machine vision detection of organism location and scenting behavior to track the search and aggregation dynamics of the honey bee Apis mellifera L. We find that bees collectively create a communication network to propagate pheromone signals, by arranging in a specific spatial distribution where there is a characteristic distance between individuals and a characteristic direction in which individuals broadcast the signals. To better understand such a flow-mediated directional communication strategy, we connect our experimental results to an agent-based model where virtual bees with simple, local behavioral rules, exist in a flow environment. Our model shows that increased directional bias leads to a more efficient aggregation process that avoids local equilibrium configurations of isotropic communication, such as small bee clusters that persist throughout the simulation. Our results highlight a novel example of extended classical stigmergy: rather than depositing static information in the environment, individual bees locally sense and globally manipulate the physical fields of chemical concentration and airflow.",

    "abstract": "Slow-wave sleep, defined by low frequency (<4 Hz) electrical brain activity, is a basic brain function affecting metabolite clearance and memory consolidation. Although the origin of low-frequency activity is related to cortical up and down states, the underlying cellular mechanism of how low-frequency activity becomes effective has remained elusive. We applied electrical stimulation to cultured glial astrocytes while monitored the trafficking of GFP-tagged intracellular vesicles using TIRFM. We found a frequency-dependent effect of electrical stimulation that electrical stimulation in low frequency elevates the mobility of astrocytic intracellular vesicles. We suggest a novel mechanism of brain modulation that electrical signals in the lower range frequencies embedded in brainwaves modulate the functionality of astrocytes for brain homeostasis and memory consolidation. This finding suggests a physiological mechanism whereby endogenous low-frequency brain oscillations enhance astrocytic function that may underlie some of the benefits of slow-wave sleep and highlights possible medical device approach for treating neurological diseases.",

    "abstract": "The ability to adjust ones behavioral strategy in complex environments is at the core of cognition. Doing so efficiently requires monitoring the reliability of the ongoing strategy and switching away from it to evaluate alternatives when appropriate. Studies in humans and non-human primates have uncovered signals in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) that track the pressure to switch away from the ongoing strategy, and others that relate to the pursuit of alternatives. However, whether these signals underlie computations that actually underpin strategy switching, or merely reflect tracking of related variables remains unclear. Here we provide causal evidence that rodent ACC actively arbitrates between persisting with ongoing behavioral choice and switching away temporarily to re-evaluate alternatives. Furthermore, by individually perturbing distinct output pathways, we establish that the two associated computations - whether to switch away from the current choice, and the pursuit of alternatives - are segregated within ACC micro-circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Normal brain function is associated with an assortment of oscillations of various frequencies, each reflecting the timing of separate computational processes and levels of synchronization within and between brain areas. Stimulation accurately delivered on a specified phase of a given oscillation provides the opportunity to target individual aspects of brain function. To achieve this, we have developed a highly responsive system to produce a continuous online phase-estimate. In addition to stable oscillations, the system accurately tracks the early cycles of short, transient oscillations and can operate across the frequency range of most established neuronal oscillations (4 to 250 Hz). Here we demonstrate bidirectional modulation of the pathologically elevated parkinsonian beta-band oscillation (around 35 Hz) in 6-OHDA hemi-lesioned rats. Beta phase, monitored using a single channel electrocorticogram above secondary motor cortex, was used to drive electrical stimulation of the globus pallidus on one of eight phases spanning the oscillation cycle. Stimulation of the early ascending phase suppressed the oscillation whereas stimulation of the early descending phase was amplifying. By implementing a rule that prevented stimulation when the phase estimate was unstable, we achieved a system that could adapt stimulation rate and pattern to respond to the changes produced in the target oscillation. This allowed the electronic system to create and maintain a state of equilibrium with the biological system resulting in continuous stable modulation of the target oscillation over time. These results demonstrate the feasibility of phase locked stimulation as a more refined strategy for remediation of pathological beta oscillations in the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease. Furthermore, they establish the utility of our algorithm and allow for the potential to assess the contribution of rhythmic activity in neuronal computation across a number of brain systems.",

Using these tools, we observed transient hypertrophies not only within key regions controlling gestation and maternal behavior (medial preoptic area, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis), but also in the amygdala, caudate nucleus and hippocampus. Additionally, unlike females exhibiting lower levels of maternal care, highly maternal females developed transient hypertrophies in somatosensory, entorhinal and retrosplenial cortices among other regions. Therefore, coordinated and transient brain modifications associated with maternal performance occurred during gestation and lactation.",

    "abstract": "Microsaccades have a steady rate of occurrence during maintained gaze fixation, which gets transiently modulated by abrupt sensory stimuli. Such modulation, characterized by a rapid reduction in microsaccade frequency followed by a stronger rebound phase of high microsaccade rate, is often described as the microsaccadic rate signature, owing to its stereotyped nature. Here we investigated the impacts of stimulus polarity (luminance increments or luminance decrements relative to background luminance) and size on the microsaccadic rate signature. We presented brief visual flashes consisting of large or small white or black stimuli over an otherwise gray image background. Both large and small stimuli caused robust early microsaccadic inhibition, but only small ones caused a subsequent increase in microsaccade frequency above baseline microsaccade rate. Critically, small black stimuli were always associated with stronger modulations in microsaccade rate after stimulus onset than small white stimuli, particularly in the post-inhibition rebound phase of the microsaccadic rate signature. Because small stimuli were also associated with expected direction oscillations to and away from their locations of appearance, these stronger rate modulations in the rebound phase meant higher likelihoods of microsaccades opposite the black flash locations relative to the white flash locations. Our results demonstrate that the microsaccadic rate signature is sensitive to stimulus polarity, and they point to dissociable neural mechanisms underlying early microsaccadic inhibition after stimulus onset and later microsaccadic rate rebound at longer times thereafter. These results also demonstrate early access of oculomotor control circuitry to sensory representations, particularly for momentarily inhibiting saccade generation.\n\nNew and noteworthyMicrosaccades are small saccades that occur during gaze fixation. Microsaccade rate is transiently reduced after sudden stimulus onsets, and then strongly rebounds before returning to baseline. We explored the influence of stimulus polarity (black versus white) on this \"rate signature\". We found that small black stimuli cause stronger microsaccadic modulations than white ones, but primarily in the rebound phase. This suggests dissociated neural mechanisms for microsaccadic inhibition and subsequent rebound in the microsaccadic rate signature.",

Individuals affected by schizophrenia present behavioural symptoms and alterations in decision-making, suggesting altered synaptic integrity as the support of the illness. It is currently unknown how this synaptic change is mediated in schizophrenia, but microglia have been proposed to act as the culprit, actively removing synapses pathologically. Here, we aimed to explore the interaction between microglia and synaptic uptake in human post-mortem tissue.\n\nMethodsWe assessed microglial activation and synaptic internalisation by microglia in a post-mortem human tissue of 10 control and 10 schizophrenia cases. Immunohistochemistry was performed to identify microglia (Iba1 and CD68) and the presynaptic terminals (synapsin I).\n\nResultsWe found no difference in microglial expression, nor a difference in pre-synaptic protein level phagocyted by microglia between the two groups.\n\nConclusionsOur findings are consistent with the brain imaging studies in schizophrenia implying that microglia play a role mainly during the early phases of the disease, by example in active synapse remodelling, which is not detected in the chronic stage of the illness.",

    "abstract": "Heightened responding to uncertain threat is considered a hallmark of anxiety disorder pathology. Here, we sought to determine if individual differences in self-reported intolerance of uncertainty (IU), a key transdiagnostic dimension in anxiety-related pathology, underlies differential recruitment of neural circuitry during instructed outcome uncertainty of threat (n = 42). In an instructed threat of shock task, cues signalled uncertain threat of shock (50%) or certain safety from shock outcomes. Ratings of arousal and valence, skin conductance response (SCR) and functional magnetic resonance imaging were acquired. Overall, participants displayed greater ratings of arousal and negative valence, SCR, and amygdala activation to uncertain threat vs. safe cues. IU was not associated with greater arousal ratings, SCR or amygdala activation to uncertain threat vs. safe cues. However, we found that high IU was associated with greater ratings of negative valence and greater activity in the medial prefrontal cortex and dorsomedial rostral prefrontal cortex to uncertain threat vs safe cues. These findings suggest that during instructed outcome uncertainty of threat, individuals high in IU rate uncertain threat as aversive and engage prefrontal cortical regions known to be involved in safety-signalling and conscious threat appraisal. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential of IU in modulating safety-signalling and conscious appraisal mechanisms in situations with instructed outcome uncertainty of threat, which may be relevant to models of anxiety-related pathology.",

Despite significant evidence from clinical studies reporting hyperactivity of the bed nucleus of stria terminalis (BNST) under these conditions, the role of BNST in fear learning and expression is still not clarified. Here, we tested how BNST modulates fear learning in mice using a chemogenetic approach. Activation of GABAergic neurons of BNST during fear acquisition, more specifically the consolidation phase, resulted in enhanced cued fear recall. Importantly, BNST activation had no acute impact on fear expression during conditioning or recalls, but it enhanced cued fear recall subsequently, potentially via altered activity of downstream regions as indicated by c-Fos. Enhanced fear memory consolidation could be replicated by selectively activating somatostatin neurons (but not corticotropin releasing factor neurons), suggesting significant modulation of fear memory strength by specific circuits of BNST.",

Using a brain-computer interface (BCI) learning paradigm in non-human primates, we identified large fluctuations in neural population activity in motor cortex (M1) indicative of arousal-like internal state changes. These fluctuations drove population activity along dimensions we term neural engagement axes. Neural engagement increased abruptly at the start of learning, and then gradually retreated. In a BCI, the causal relationship between neural activity and behavior is known. This allowed us to understand how these changes impacted behavioral performance for different task goals. We found that neural engagement interacted with learning, helping to explain why animals learned some task goals more quickly than others.",

    "abstract": "The months between birth and age 2 are increasingly recognized as a period critical for neuro-development, with potentially life-long implications for cognitive functioning. However, little is known about the growth trajectories of brain structure and function across this time period. This is in large part because of insufficient approaches to analyze infant MRI scans at different months, especially brain segmentation. Addressing technical gaps in infant brain segmentation would significantly improve our capacity to efficiently measure and identify relevant infant brain structures and connectivity, and their role in long-term development. In this paper, we propose a transfer-learning approach based on convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image segmentation architecture, QuickNAT, to segment brain structures for newborns and 6-month infants separately. We pre-trained QuickNAT on auxiliary labels from a large-scale dataset, fine-tuned on manual labels, and then cross-validated the models performance on two separate datasets. Compared to other commonly used methods, our transfer-learning approach showed superior segmentation performance on both newborns and 6-month infants. Moreover, we demonstrated improved hippocampus segmentation performance via our approach in preterm infants.",

Here we test whether future imagination can be decomposed into two dissociable psychological processes linked to different subcomponents of the DMN. While measuring brain activity with fMRI as subjects imagine future events, we manipulate the vividness of these events to modulate the demands for scene construction, and we manipulate the valence of these events to modulate the demands for evaluation. We found that one subcomponent of the DMN, the ventral DMN or medial temporal lobe subsystem, responds to the vividness but not the valence of imagined events. In contrast, another subcomponent, the dorsal or core DMN, responds to the valence but not the vividness of imagined events. This separate modifiability of different subcomponents of the DMN by vividness and valence provides strong evidence for a neurocognitive dissociation between (1) the construction of novel, imagined scenes from individual components from memory and (2) the evaluation of these constructed events as desirable or undesirable.\n\nSignificance StatementPrevious work has suggested that imagination may depend on separate neural networks involved in the construction and evaluation of imagined future events. This study provides strong neural evidence for this dissociation by demonstrating that two components of the brains default mode network (DMN) uniquely and specifically respond to different aspects of imagination. The vividness of imagined events modulates the ventral DMN, but not the dorsal DMN, while the valence of imagined events modulates the dorsal DMN, but not the ventral DMN.

    "abstract": "Structure-function analyses of the mammalian brain have historically relied on anatomically-based approaches. In these investigations, physical, chemical, or electrolytic lesions of anatomical structures are applied, and the resulting behavioral or physiological responses assayed. An alternative approach is to focus on the expression pattern of a molecule whose function has been characterized and then use genetic intersectional methods to optogenetically or chemogenetically manipulate distinct circuits. We previously identified WIDE AWAKE (WAKE) in Drosophila, a clock output molecule that mediates the temporal regulation of sleep onset and sleep maintenance. More recently, we have studied the mouse homolog, mWAKE/ANKFN1, and found that its role in the circadian regulation of arousal is conserved. Here, we perform a systematic analysis of the expression pattern of mWake mRNA, protein, and cells throughout the adult mouse brain. We find that mWAKE labels neurons in a restricted, but distributed manner, in multiple regions of the hypothalamus (including the suprachiasmatic nucleus), the limbic system, sensory processing nuclei, and additional specific brainstem, subcortical, and cortical areas. Interestingly, mWAKE is also observed in non-neuronal ependymal cells. In addition, to describe the molecular identities and clustering of mWake+ cells, we provide detailed analyses of single cell RNA sequencing data from the hypothalamus, a region with particularly significant mWAKE expression. These findings lay the groundwork for future studies into the potential role of mWake+ cells in the rhythmic control of diverse behaviors and physiological processes.",

Here, we uncover that MCH modulates the hippocampo (HP) -dorsal lateral septum (dLS) -lateral hypothalamus neural circuit to facilitate spatial learning and memory. MCH achieves this function by enhancing both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission via presynaptic mechanisms. The dLS neuronal spiking activity in response to HP CA3 excitatory inputs is strongly controlled by feed-forward inhibition (FFI) mediated by both GABAA and GABAB receptors. Endogenous MCH signaling enhances Signal/Noise (S/N) ratio of dLS neurons by increase the excitatory strengths, meanwhile decrease the overall dLS excitability by enhance inhibition which reduces dLS FFI, and consequentially enables dLS neurons to fire with high fidelity with HP synaptic inputs.

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDPatients suffering from schizophrenia demonstrate abnormal brain activity, as well as alterations in patterns of functional connectivity assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Previous studies in healthy participants suggest a strong association between resting-state functional connectivity and task-evoked brain activity that could be detected at an individual level, and show that brain activation in various tasks could be predicted from task-free fMRI scans. In the current study we aimed to predict brain activity in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, using a prediction model based on healthy individuals exclusively. This offers novel insights regarding the interrelations between brain connectivity and activity in schizophrenia.\n\nMETHODSWe generated a prediction model using a group of 80 healthy controls that performed the well-validated N-back task, and used it to predict individual variability in task-evoked brain activation in 20 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.\n\nRESULTSWe demonstrated a successful prediction of individual variability in the task-evoked brain activation based on resting-state functional connectivity. The predictions were highly sensitive, reflected by high correlations between predicted and actual activation maps (Median = 0.589, SD = 0.193) and specific, evaluated by a Kolomogrov-Smirnov test (D = 0.25, p < 0.0001).\n\nCONCLUSIONSA Successful prediction of brain activity from resting-state functional connectivity highlights the strong coupling between the two. Moreover, our results support the notion that even though resting-state functional connectivity and task-evoked brain activity are frequently reported to be altered in schizophrenia, the relations between them remains unaffected. This may allow to generate task activity maps for clinical populations without the need the actually perform the task.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has spread worldwide and put most of the world under lockdown. Despite that there have been emergently approved vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths have remained rising. Thus, rapid diagnosis and necessary public health measures are still key parts to contain the pandemic. In this study, the colorimetric isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAATs) for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), cross-priming amplification (CPA), and polymerase spiral reaction (PSR) were designed and evaluated. The three methods showed the same limit of detection (LOD) value of 1 copy of the targeted gene per reaction. However, for the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 genomic-RNA, LAMP outperformed both CPA and PSR, exhibiting the LOD value of roughly 43.14 genome copies/reaction. The results can be read with the naked eye within 45 minutes, without cross-reactivity to closely related coronaviruses. Moreover, the direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in simulated patient specimens by iNAATs was also successful. Finally, the ready-to-use lyophilized reagents for LAMP reactions were shown to maintain the sensitivity and LOD value of the liquid assays. The results indicate that the colorimetric lyophilized LAMP kit developed herein is highly suitable for detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids at point-of-care.",

    "abstract": "Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, therefore its precise control is vital for maintaining normal brain function and preventing excitotoxicity1. Removal of extracellular glutamate is achieved by plasma membrane-bound transporters, which couple glutamate transport to sodium, potassium and pH gradients using an elevator mechanism2-5. Glutamate transporters also conduct chloride ions via a channel-like process that is thermodynamically uncoupled from transport6-8. However, the molecular mechanisms that allow these dual-function transporters to carry out two seemingly contradictory roles are unknown. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a glutamate transporter homologue in an open-channel state, revealing an aqueous cavity that is formed during the transport cycle. Using functional studies and molecular dynamics simulations, we show that this cavity is an aqueous-accessible chloride permeation pathway gated by two hydrophobic regions, and is conserved across mammalian and archaeal glutamate transporters. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism by which glutamate transporters support their dual function and add a crucial piece of information to aid mapping of the complete transport cycle shared by the SLC1A transporter family.",

    "abstract": "Detection of viral RNA by PCR is currently the main diagnostic tool for COVID-19 [1]. The PCR-based test, however, shows limited sensitivity, especially at early and late stages of the disease development [2,3], and is relatively time consuming. Fast and reliable complementary methods for detecting the viral infection would be of help in the current pandemia conditions. Mass-spectrometry is one of such possibilities. We have developed a mass-spectrometry based method for the detection of the SARS CoV-2 virus in nasopharynx epithelial swabs, based on the detection of the viral nucleocapsid N protein. The N protein of the SARS-COV-2 virus, the most abundant protein in the virion, is the best candidate for mass-spectrometric detection of the infection, and MS-based detection of several peptides from the SARS-COoV-2 nucleoprotein has been reported earlier by the Sinz group [4]. Our approach shows confident identification of the N protein in patient samples even with the lowest viral loads and a much simpler preparation procedure. Our main protocol consists of virus inactivation by heating and adding of isopropanol, and tryptic digestion of the proteins sedimented from the swabs followed by MS analysis. A set of unique peptides, produced as a result of proteolysis of the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of SARS-CoV-2, is detected. The obtained results can further be used to create fast parallel mass-spectrometric approaches for the detection of the virus in the nasopharyngeal mucosa, saliva, sputum and other physiological fluids.",

    "abstract": "The availability of genome sequence data combined with bioinformatic genome mining has accelerated the identification of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Ramoplanins and enduracidins are lipodepsipeptides produced by Actinoplanes ramoplaninifer ATCC 33076 and Streptomyces fungicidicus B-5477, respectively, that exhibit excellent in vitro activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive pathogens. To explore if ramoplanin/enduracidin-like BGCs exist within genomes of organisms sequenced to date, we devised a targeted genome mining strategy that employed structure-activity relationships to identify conserved, essential biosynthesis genes from the ramoplanin and enduracidin BGCs. Five microorganisms were found to contain ramoplanin-like BGCs: the enediyne antibiotic producer Micromonospora chersina strain DSM 44151(dynemycin); the glycopeptide antibiotic producers Amycolatopsis orientalis strain B-37 (norvancomycin), Amycolatopsis orientalis strain DSM 40040 (vancomycin), and Amycolatopsis balhimycina FH1894 strain DSM 44591 (balhimycin); and Streptomyces sp. TLI_053. A single compound from fermentation of M. chersina was purified to homogeneity and found to possess good antibiotic activity against several Gram-positive bacterial test strains (1-2 g/mL), comparing favorably to ramoplanin family members. We named this compound chersinamycin and elucidated its covalent structure, which differs distinctly from ramoplanins and enduracidins. Further, the chersinamycin BGC was validated through insertional gene inactivation using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. In addition to the information gained by comparing and contrasting the sequence and organization of these five new BGCs, the amenability of M. chersina to genetic manipulation provides a much-needed tool to investigate the fundamental aspects of lipodepsipeptide biosynthesis and to facilitate metabolic engineering efforts for the production of novel antibiotics capable of combating antibiotic-resistant infections.",

It also functions as an oncogene that contributes to the self-renewal of breast cancer stem cells by regulating polycomb complexes. Here we show that the silencing of KDM2B results in the downregulation of SNAI2 (SLUG), SNAI1 (SNAIL) and SOX9, which also contribute to the biology of mammary stem and progenitor cells. The downregulation of these molecules is posttranscriptional and in the case of the SNAI2-encoded SLUG, it is due to calpain-dependent proteolytic degradation. Mechanistically, the latter depends on the activation of calpastatin-sensitive classical calpain(s) and on the phosphorylation-dependent inhibition of GSK3 via paracrine mechanisms. GSK3 inhibition sensitizes its target SLUG to classical calpains, which are activated by Ca2+ influx and calpastatin downregulation. The degradation of SLUG, induced by the KDM2B knockdown, promotes the differentiation of breast cancer stem cells in culture and reveals an unexpected mechanism of stem cell regulation by a histone demethylase.",

We introduce a model for the evolution of the distribution of affinities across the antibody population in germinal centers.

It is also capable, upon maximum-likelihood inference of the parameters, to reproduce accurately the distributions of affinities of IgG-secreting cells we measure in mice immunized against Tetanus Toxoid under largely varying conditions (antigen dosage, delay between injections). Both model and experiments show that the average population affinity depends non-monotonically on the antigen dosage. We show that combining quantitative modelling and statistical inference is a concrete way to investigate biological processes underlying affinity maturation (such as selection permissiveness), hardly accessible through measurements.",

The accessory protein PA-X is expressed due to a ribosomal frameshift during translation of the PA gene. Depending on the particular combination of virus strain and host species, PA-X has been described as either acting to either reduce or increase virulence and/or virus replication. In this study, we set out to investigate the role PA-X plays in H9N2 avian influenza viruses, focussing particularly on the natural avian host, chickens. We found H9N2 PA-X induced robust host shutoff in both mammalian and avian cells and increased replication in mammalian, but not avian cells. We further showed that PA-X affected embryonic lethality in ovo and led to more rapid viral shedding and widespread organ dissemination in vivo in chickens. Overall, we conclude PA-X may act as a virulence factor for H9N2 viruses in chickens, allowing faster replication and wider organ tropism.",

ROS-mediated oxidation of host membrane poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) generates the toxic alpha-beta carbonyl 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE). Though studied extensively in the context of sterile inflammation, 4-HNEs role during infection remains limited. Here we found that 4-HNE is generated during bacterial infection and that the intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes induces a specific set of genes in response to 4-HNE exposure. A component of the L. monocytogenes 4-HNE response is the expression of the genes rha1 and rha2 which code for two NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases that collectively counter 4-HNE toxicity. Heterologous expression of rha1/2 in Bacillus subtilis significantly increased bacterial resistance to 4-HNE both in vitro and following phagocytosis by murine macrophages. Our work demonstrates that 4-HNE is a previously unappreciated component of ROS-mediated toxicity and that L. monocytogenes has evolved specific countermeasures to survive within its presence.",

    "abstract": "A key step in the life cycle of enveloped viruses is the budding of nascent virions from the host membrane. In filoviruses such as Ebola and Marburg virus, this process is achieved by the matrix protein VP40. When expressed alone, VP40 induces the budding of filamentous virus-like particles, suggesting that localization to the plasma membrane, oligomerization into a matrix layer, and the generation of membrane curvature are intrinsic properties of VP40. While a number of crystal structures of VP40 have been determined in various oligomerization states, there has been no direct information on the structure of assembled VP40 matrix layers within viruses or virus-like particles. Here, we present structures of Ebola and Marburg VP40 matrix layers in intact virus-like particles, as well as within intact Marburg viruses. We find that the matrix layers are formed from VP40 dimers which assemble into extended chains via C-terminal domain interactions. These chains stack into layers, forming a 2D lattice below the membrane surface. However, these 2D lattices are only locally ordered, forming a patchwork assembly across the membrane surfaces and suggesting that assembly may begin at multiple points. These observations define the structure and arrangement of the matrix protein layer that mediates the formation of filamentous filovirus particles.",

    "abstract": "Measuring the biomechanical properties of the mouse sclera is of great interest, since altered scleral properties are features of many common ocular pathologies, and the mouse is a powerful species for studying genetic factors in disease. Here, a poroelastic material model is used to analyze data from unconfined compression testing of both pig and mouse sclera, and the tensile modulus, compressive modulus, and permeability of the sclera are obtained at three levels of compressive strain. Values for all three properties measured simultaneously by unconfined compression of pig sclera were comparable to previously reported values measured by tests specific for each property, i.e., compression tests, biaxial tensile tests, and falling-head permeability assays. The repeatability of the approach was evaluated using test-retest experimental paradigm on pig sclera. Repeatability was low for measured compressive stiffness, indicating permanent changes to the samples occurring after the first test. However, reasonable repeatability for tensile stiffness and permeability was observed. The intrinsic material properties of the mouse sclera were measured for the first time. Tensile stiffness and permeability of the sclera in both species were seen to be dependent on the state of compressive strain. We conclude that unconfined compression testing of sclera, when analyzed with poroelastic theory, can be used as a powerful tool to phenotype mouse scleral changes in future genotype-phenotype association studies.\n\nStatement of SignificanceOcular biomechanics is strongly influenced by the sclera, the outermost white coat of the eye. Many ocular diseases are believed to be influenced by pathological changes to scleral microstructure and biomechanics, making intrinsic biomechanical properties an important outcome measure in many studies. However, the small mouse eye precludes the use of most traditional biomechanical characterization techniques. Here, we show that unconfined compression testing analyzed with poroelastic theory can produce measurements of biomechanical properties in the pig sclera comparable to those measured by other traditional techniques. Importantly, this technique can be successfully applied to the mouse sclera, enabling more widespread use of the species as a model for ocular disease.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria from the same species can differ widely in their gene content. In E. coli, the set of genes shared by all strains, known as the core genome, represents about half the number of genes present in any strain. While recent advances in bacterial genomics have enabled to unravel genes required for fitness in various experimental conditions at the genome scale, most studies have focused on model strains. As a result, the impact of this genetic diversity on core processes of the bacterial cell largely remains to be investigated. Here, we developed a new CRISPR interference platform for high-throughput gene repression that is compatible with most E. coli isolates and closely-related species. We applied it to assess the importance of [~]3,400 nearly ubiquitous genes in 3 growth media in 18 representative E. coli strains spanning most common phylogroups and lifestyles of the species. Our screens highlighted extensive variations in gene essentiality between strains and conditions. Unlike variations in gene expression level, variations in gene essentiality do not recapitulate the strains phylogeny. Investigation of the genetic determinants for these variations highlighted the importance of epistatic interactions with mobile genetic elements. In particular, we showed how mobile genetic elements can trigger the essentiality of core genes that are usually nonessential. This study provides new insights into the evolvability of gene essentiality and argues for the importance of studying various isolates from the same species in bacterial genomics.",

    "abstract": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), a double-stranded DNA virus, causes varicella, establishes lifelong latency in ganglionic neurons, and reactivates later in life to cause herpes zoster, commonly associated with chronic pain. The VZV genome is densely packed and produces multitudes of overlapping transcripts deriving from both strands. While 71 distinct open reading frames (ORFs) have thus far been experimentally defined, the full coding potential of VZV remains unknown. Here, we integrated multiple short-read RNA sequencing approaches with long-read direct RNA sequencing on RNA isolated from VZV-infected cells to provide a comprehensive reannotation of the lytic VZV transcriptome architecture. Through precise mapping of transcription start sites, splice junctions, and polyadenylation sites, we identified 136 distinct polyadenylated VZV RNAs that encode canonical ORFs, non-canonical ORFs, and ORF fusions, as well as putative non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). Furthermore, we determined the kinetic class of all VZV transcripts and observed, unexpectedly, that transcripts encoding the ORF62 protein, previously designated as immediate-early, were expressed with late kinetics. Our work showcases the complexity of the VZV transcriptome and provides a comprehensive resource that will facilitate future functional studies of coding RNAs, ncRNAs, and the biological mechanisms underlying the regulation of viral transcription and translation during lytic VZV infection.",

    "abstract": "Extremely oligotrophic deep groundwaters host organisms attuned to the low-end of the bioenergetics spectrum. While all domains of life along with viruses are active in this habitat, the evolutionary and ecological constraints on colonization and niche shifts and their consequences for the microbiome convergence are unknown. Here we provide a comparative genome-resolved analysis of the prokaryotic community in disconnected fracture fluids of the Fennoscandian Shield. The data show that the oligotrophic deep groundwaters flowing in similar lithologies offer fixed niches that are occupied by a common deep groundwater core microbiome. Based on this high resolution \"multi-omics\" enabled understanding of the underlying mechanisms via functional expression analysis, we conclude that deep groundwater ecosystems foster highly diverse, yet cooperative microbial communities adapted to this setting. The fitness of primary energy producers is increased by ecological traits such as aggregate or biofilm formation. This also facilitates reciprocal promiscuous partnerships with diverse and prevalent epi-bionts, alleviating the \"tragedy of common goods\". Hence, instead of a lifestyle where microbes predominantly invest in functions related to maintenance and survival, an episodic and cooperative lifestyle ensures the subsistence of the deep groundwater microbiome. We suggest the name \"halt and catch fire\" for this way of life.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCase numbers of listeriosis have been increasing in Germany and the European Union during the last decade. In addition reports on the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in Listeria monocytogenes in clinical and environmental isolates are accumulating. The susceptibility towards 14 antibiotics was tested in a selection of clinical L. monocytogenes isolates to get a more precise picture of the development and manifestation of antibiotic resistance in the L. monocytogenes population. Based on the population structure determined by core genome multi locus sequence typing (cgMLST) 544 out of 1,220 sequenced strains collected in Germany between 2009 and 2019 were selected to cover the phylogenetic diversity observed in the clinical L. monocytogenes population. All isolates tested were susceptible towards ampicillin, penicillin and co-trimoxazole - the most relevant antibiotics in the treatment of listeriosis. Resistance to daptomycin and ciprofloxacin was observed in 493 (91%) and in 71 (13%) of 544 isolates, respectively. While all tested strains showed resistance towards ceftriaxone, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) observed varied widely between 4 mg/L up to >128 mg/L. An allelic variation of the penicillin binding protein gene pbpB3 could be identified as the cause of this difference in ceftriaxone resistance levels. This study is the first population structure-guided analysis of antimicrobial resistance in recent clinical isolates and confirms the importance of penicillin binding protein B3 (PBP B3) for the high level of intrinsic cephalosporin resistance of L. monocytogenes on a population-wide scale.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is an acute and life-threatening gastrointestinal disorder afflicting preterm infants, which is currently unpreventable. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a promising preventative therapy, but potential side effects raise concern. Removal of bacteria from donor fecal water may reduce side effects while maintaining wanted effects. We aimed to assess preclinical efficacy and safety of bacteria-free fecal filtrate transfer (FFT).\n\nMethodsUsing fecal material from healthy suckling piglets, we administered rectal FMT or cognate FFT by either rectal or oro-gastric administration to formula-fed preterm, cesarean piglets, and compared gut pathology and related safety parameters with saline controls. We then analyzed mucosa and luminal bacterial and viral composition using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metavirome sequencing, respectively. Finally, we used isolated ileal mucosa, coupled with RNA-Seq, to gauge the host response to the different treatments.\n\nResultsOro-gastric FFT eliminated NEC, which was confirmed by microscopy, whereas FMT did not perform better than control. Moreover, FFT but not FMT reduced intestinal permeability, whereas FMT animals had reduced body weight increase and intestinal growth. Oro-gastric FFT increased viral diversity and reduced Proteobacteria abundance in ileal mucosa relative to control. Global gene expression of host mucosa responded to FMT but not FFT with increased and decreased bacterial and viral defense mechanisms, respectively.\n\nConclusionsAs preterm infants are extremely vulnerable, rational therapies need incontestable safety profiles. Here we show in a clinically relevant animal model that FFT, as opposed to FMT, efficiently prevents NEC without any recognizable side effects. If translatable to preterm infants, this could lead to a change of practice and in turn a reduction in NEC burden.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTNurr1/NR4A2 is an orphan nuclear receptor transcription factor implicated as a potential drug target for neurological disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases. Previous studies identified small molecule modulators of NR4A nuclear receptors including Nurr1 and Nur77/NR4A1; it remains unclear whether these ligands affect Nurr1 through direct binding or indirect non-binding mechanisms. We assessed a panel of twelve ligands reported to affect NR4A activity for Nurr1-dependent and Nurr1-independent transcriptional effects and binding to the Nurr1 ligand-binding domain (LBD). Most of the NR4A ligands show Nurr1-independent effects on transcription in a cell type-specific manner, suggesting they may function through binding to effector proteins whose downstream activities influence Nurr1 function. Protein NMR spectroscopy structural footprinting data show that 4-amino-7-chloroquinoline derivatives (amodiaquine and chloroquine) and cytosporone B directly bind the Nurr1 LBD. In contrast, other NR4A ligands including commercially available compounds such as C-DIM12, celastrol, camptothecin, IP7e, isoalantolactone, and TMPA do not bind the Nurr1 LBD. Interestingly, previous crystal structures indicate that cytosporone B analogs bind to surface pockets in the Nur77 LBD, but protein NMR data indicate cytosporone B likely binds to the Nurr1 orthosteric pocket. These findings should influence medicinal chemistry efforts that desire to optimize Nurr1-binding ligands as opposed to ligands that function through binding to Nurr1 effector proteins.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The development of modern genome editing tools has enabled researchers to make edits with high precision, but has left unsolved the problem of designing these edits. We propose Ledidi, an approach that treats the design of genomic edits as an optimization problem where the goal is to produce the desired output from a predictive model. The discrete nature of biological sequences makes direct optimization challenging, but we overcome this by using the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization trick. We validate Ledidi by pairing it with the Basenji model, which makes predictions for thousands of functional profiles, and designing edits that affect CTCF binding and induce cell type-specific binding of JUND.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe first cases of the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in December 2019. Until the end of February 2020, the number of available genomes was below 1,000, and their multiple alignment was easily achieved using standard approaches. Subsequently, the availability of genomes has grown dramatically. Moreover, some genomes are of low quality with sequencing/assembly errors, making accurate re-alignment of all genomes nearly impossible on a daily basis. A more efficient, yet accurate approach was clearly required to pursue all subsequent bioinformatics analyses of this crucial data.\n\nResultshCoV-19 genomes are highly conserved, with very few indels and no recombination. This makes the profile HMM approach particularly well suited to align new genomes, add them to an existing alignment and filter problematic ones. Using a core of [~]2,500 high quality genomes, we estimated a profile using HMMER, and implemented this profile in COVID-Align, a user-friendly interface to be used online or as standalone via Docker. The alignment of 1,000 genomes requires less than 20mn on our cluster. Moreover, COVID-Align provides summary statistics, which can be used to determine the sequencing quality and evolutionary novelty of input genomes (e.g. number of new mutations and indels).\n\nAvailabilityhttps://covalign.pasteur.cloud, hub.docker.com/r/evolbioinfo/covid-align\n\nContactsolivier.gascuel@pasteur.fr, frederic.lemoine@pasteur.fr\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary information is available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "*Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is commonly isolated from airway of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. However, to what extent NTHi persistence contributes to the lung inflammatory burden during CF chronic airway disease is controversial. Here, we aimed at determining the pathological role of NTHi persistence in a cohort of CF patients and in a newly generated mouse model of NTHi persistence.\n\nIn our study cohort, we found that CF patients chronically colonized by NTHi had significantly higher levels of IL-8 and CXCL1 than those who were not colonized. To better define the impact of NTHi persistence in fuelling inflammatory response, we developed a new mouse model using both laboratory and CF clinical strains. NTHi persistence was associated with chronic inflammation of the lung, characterized by recruitment of neutrophils and cytokine release (KC, G-CFS, IL-6 and IL-17A) at 2 and 14 days postinfection. An increased burden of T cell mediated response (CD4+ and {gamma}{delta} cells) and higher levels of matrix metalloproteinase 9, known to be associated with tissue remodelling, were observed at 14 days post-infection. Of note we found that both CD4+IL-17+ cells and levels of IL-17 cytokine were enriched in mice at advanced stage of NTHi chronic infection. Moreover, by immunohistochemistry we found CD3+, B220+ and CXCL-13+ cells localized in bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue-like structures at day 14.\n\nOur results demonstrate that NTHi persistence exerts a pro-inflammatory activity in the human and murine lung, and could therefore contribute to the exaggerated burden of lung inflammation in CF patients.",
