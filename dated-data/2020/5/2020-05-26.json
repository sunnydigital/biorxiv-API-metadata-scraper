    "abstract": "We are constantly exposed to multiple visual scenes, and while freely viewing them without an intentional effort to memorize or encode them, only some are remembered. It has been suggested that image memorability is influenced by multiple factors as depth of processing (1-3), familiarity (4), and visual category (5-7). However, this is typically investigated with intentional (8, 9) or unintentional (10, 11) encoding tasks. Furthermore, since visual memory relies on size-invariant visual perception (12-14), image size is not considered a contributing factor. Here we reasoned that during naturalistic free viewing of images without an encoding task, bigger images would be better remembered due to multiple factors (as vaster expanse of activated visual cortex (15, 16), deeper processing). In an extensive set of experiments participants (n=117) freely viewed small to large images (3{degrees}-24{degrees}) without any encoding task. Subsequently, they were presented with mid-sized images (50% already seen) and were asked to report if they recall seeing them or not. Larger images were better remembered (~23% more than smaller images), image memorability was proportional to image size, faces were better remembered, and outdoors the least. These were independent of image set, presentation order, or screen resolution. While multiple factors affect image memorability (1-7), here we show that during free viewing with no encoding task, a basic physical image dimension influences its memorability.",

    "abstract": "The use of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) by inhalation using e-cigarette technology grows increasingly popular for medical and recreational purposes. This has led to development of e-cigarette based techniques to study the delivery of THC by inhalation in laboratory rodents. Inhaled THC reliably produces hypothermic and antinociceptive effects in rats, similar to effects of parenteral injection of THC. This study was conducted to determine the extent to which the hypothermic response depends on interactions with the CB1 receptor, using pharmacological antagonist (SR141716, AM-251) approaches. Groups of rats were implanted with radiotelemetry devices capable of reporting activity and body temperature, which were assessed after THC inhalation or injection. SR141716 (4 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked or attenuated antinociceptive effects of acute THC inhalation in male and female rats. SR141716 was unable to block the initial hypothermia caused by THC inhalation, but temperature was restored to normal more quickly. Alterations in antagonist pre-treatment time, dose and the use of a rat strain with less sensitivity to THC-induced hypothermia did not change this pattern. Pre-treatment with SR141716 (4 mg/kg, i.p.) blocked hypothermia induced by i.v. THC and reversed hypothermia when administered 45 or 90 minutes after THC (i.p.). SR141716 and AM-251 (4 mg/kg, i.p.) sped recovery from, but did not block, hypothermia caused by vapor THC in female rats made tolerant by prior repeated THC vapor inhalation. The CB2 antagonist AM-630, had no effect. These results suggest that hypothermia consequent to THC inhalation is induced by other mechanisms in addition to CB1 receptor activation.Competing Interest StatementAuthor SAV has consulted for La Jolla Alcohol Research, Inc., the vendor that supplies our vapor inhalation equipment.AbbreviationsPGpropylene glycol;SR141716 (SR)5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichloro-phenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide;AM-251N-(Piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide;AM-6306-Iodo-2-methyl-1-[2-(4-morpholinyl)ethyl]-1H-indol-3-yl](4-methoxyphenyl)methanone;THC\u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol;View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Study of DNA repeats in model organisms highlights the role of repetitive DNA in many processes that drive genome evolution and phenotypic change. Because repetitive DNA is much more dynamic than single-copy DNA, repetitive sequences can reveal signals of evolutionary history over short time scales that may not be evident in sequences from slower-evolving genomic regions. Many tools for studying repeats are directed toward organisms with existing genomic resources, including genome assemblies and repeat libraries. However, signals in repeat variation may prove especially valuable in disentangling evolutionary histories in diverse non-model groups, for which genomic resources are limited. Here we introduce RepeatProfiler, a tool for generating, visualizing, and comparing repetitive DNA profiles from low-coverage, short-read sequence data. RepeatProfiler automates the generation and visualization of repetitive DNA coverage depth profiles and allows for statistical comparison of profile shape across samples. In addition, RepeatProfiler facilitates comparison of profiles by extracting signal from sequence variants across profiles which can then be analyzed as molecular morphological characters using phylogenetic analysis. We validate RepeatProfiler with data sets from ground beetles (Bembidion), flies (Drosophila), and tomatoes (Solanum). We highlight the potential of repetitive DNA profiles as a high-resolution data source for studies in species delimitation, comparative genomics, and repeat biology.",

    "abstract": "MeCP2 is an abundant protein in mature nerve cells, where it binds to DNA sequences containing methylated cytosine. Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause the severe neurological disorder Rett syndrome (RTT), provoking intensive study of the underlying molecular mechanisms. Multiple functions have been proposed, one of which involves a regulatory role in splicing. Here we leverage the recent availability of high-quality transcriptomic data sets to probe quantitatively the potential influence of MeCP2 on alternative splicing. Using a variety of machine learning approaches that can capture both linear and non-linear associations, we show that widely different levels of MeCP2 have a minimal effect on alternative splicing in three different systems. Alternative splicing was also apparently indifferent to developmental changes in DNA methylation levels. Our results suggest that regulation of splicing is not a major function of MeCP2. They also highlight the importance of multi-variate quantitative analyses in the formulation of biological hypotheses.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/115154v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1842d5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@be867corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6f46a8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@187f83c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have become a new line of therapy for Homologous Recombination (HR)-deficient cancers. However, resistance to PARPi has emerged as a major clinical problem. DNA polymerase theta (POL{theta}) is synthetic lethal with HR and a druggable target in HR-deficient cancers. Here, we identified the antibiotic Novobiocin (NVB) as a specific POL{theta} inhibitor that selectively kills HR-deficient tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. NVB directly binds to the POL{theta} ATPase domain, inhibits its ATPase activity, and phenocopies POL{theta} depletion. BRCA-deficient tumor cells and those with acquired PARPi resistance are sensitive to NVB in vitro and in vivo. Increased POL{theta} expression levels predict NVB sensitivity. The mechanism of NVB-mediated cell death in PARPi resistant cells is the accumulation of toxic RAD51 foci, which also provides a pharmacodynamic biomarker for NVB response. Our results demonstrate that NVB may be useful alone or in combination with PARPi in treating HR-deficient tumors, including those with acquired PARPi resistance.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe identified Novobiocin as a specific POL{theta} inhibitor that selectively kills naive and PARPi resistance HR-deficient tumors in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most challenging cancer to treat. Due to the asymptomatic nature of the disease and ineffective drug treatment modalities, the survival rate of PDAC patients remains one of the lowest. The recurrent genetic alterations in PDAC are yet to be targeted; therefore, identifying effective therapeutic combinations is desperately needed. Here, we performed an in vivo CRISPR screening in a clinically relevant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model system to identify synergistic drug combinations for PDAC treatment. Our approach revealed protein arginine methyltransferase gene 5 (PRMT5) as a promising druggable candidate whose inhibition creates synergistic vulnerability of PDAC cells to gemcitabine. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition results indicate that of PRMT5 depletion results in synergistic cytotoxicity with Gem due to depleted replication protein A (RPA) levels and an impaired non-homology end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair. Thus, the novel combination creates conditional lethality through the accumulation of excessive DNA damage and cell death, both in vitro and in vivo. The findings demonstrate that unbiased genetic screenings combined with a clinically relevant model system is an effective approach in identifying synthetic lethal drug combinations for cancer treatment.\n\nSTATEMENT of SIGNIFICANCEIdentify synergistic drug combinations for PDAC is a significant unmet need. Through CRISPR screening, we discovered and validated that PRMT5 depletion creates synergistic vulnerability of PDAC cells to gemcitabine. Mechanistically, the combination impairs DNA repair, synergistic accumulation of DNA damage and cell death in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The etiology of congenital heart defects (CHDs), amongst the most common human birth defects, is poorly understood partly because of its complex genetic architecture. Here we show that two genes previously implicated in CHDs, Megf8 and Mgrn1, interact genetically and biochemically to regulate the strength of Hedgehog signaling in target cells. MEGF8, a single-pass transmembrane protein, and MGRN1, a RING superfamily E3 ligase, assemble to form a transmembrane ubiquitin ligase complex that catalyzes the ubiquitination and degradation of the Hedgehog pathway transducer Smoothened. Homozygous Megf8 and Mgrn1 mutations increased Smoothened abundance and elevated sensitivity to Hedgehog ligands. While mice heterozygous for loss-of-function Megf8 or Mgrn1 mutations were normal, double heterozygous embryos exhibited an incompletely penetrant syndrome of CHDs with heterotaxy. Thus, genetic interactions between components of a receptor-like ubiquitin ligase complex that tunes morphogen signaling strength can cause a birth defect syndrome inherited in an oligogenic pattern.",

    "abstract": "Regime shifts of climatic and environmental conditions potentially affect productivity of fisheries resources, posing challenging issues to stock management. The stocks of the Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus) are suspected to suffer from regime shifts, but their detection is difficult and possibly doubtful because the nature of short-lived species readily makes the effect of regime shifts confounded with observation errors. Here we developed a new state-space assessment model to evaluate the influence of regime shifts on spawner-recruitment relationship of the Japanese flying squid. The model simultaneously estimates the population dynamics of multiple stocks that could share some life history parameters, making parameter inference stable. We demonstrate that two-time regime shifts of productivity around 1991 and 2015 caused two-to three-fold changes of maximum sustinabile yields. The model with regime shifts clarifies the relationship between fishing pressure and spawner abudance that is difficult to detect in a model with no regime shift. The state-space approach will be a promising tool to accurately assess stock status by separating recruitment process from observation errors and contribute tothe management of marine biological resources sensitive to regime shifts.",

    "abstract": "The design and interpretation of prevalence studies rely on point estimates of the performance characteristics of the diagnostic test used. When the test characteristics are not well defined and a limited number of tests are available, such as during an outbreak of a novel pathogen, tests can be used either for the field study itself or for additional validation to reduce uncertainty in the test characteristics. Because field data and validation data are based on finite samples, inferences drawn from these data carry uncertainty. In the absence of a framework to balance those uncertainties during study design, it is unclear how best to distribute tests to improve study estimates. Here, we address this gap by introducing a joint Bayesian model to simultaneously analyze lab validation and field survey data. In many scenarios, prevalence estimates can be most improved by apportioning additional effort towards validation rather than to the field. We show that a joint model provides superior estimation of prevalence, as well as sensitivity and specificity, compared with typical analyses that model lab and field data separately.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the deadliest cancers. Uncovering mechanisms responsible for the heterogeneous clinical features of this disease is an essential step toward developing improved and more specific therapeutic approaches. Here, we sought to identify transcriptional regulators of aggressive PDAC growth through in vivo CRISPR screening of epigenetic and transcription factors in an orthotopic model. We identified the ISL LIM homeobox 2 (ISL2) gene as a tumor suppressor whose depletion enhances the proliferation of human PDAC cells in vitro and in vivo and cooperates with activated KRAS to initiate PDAC in a murine model. Conversely, the upregulation of ISL2 expression through CRISPR-mediated locus-specific epigenetic editing results in reduced cell proliferation. Importantly, ISL2 is epigenetically silenced through DNA methylation in ~60% of PDAC tumors, which correlates with poor patient outcome. Functional studies showed that ISL2 loss rewires metabolic gene expression, and consequently potentiates oxidative phosphorylation while reducing glycolysis. This metabolic shift creates selective vulnerability to small molecule inhibitors of mitochondrial respiration and fatty acid oxidation. Collectively, these findings reveal ISL2 as a novel tumor suppressor whose inactivation drives metabolic reprogramming in an aggressive PDAC subset and point to potential therapeutic vulnerabilities in these tumors.",

    "abstract": "Edaravone has been recently used for the treatment of acute cerebral infarction. However, there is no data on the protective effects of this drug against hypoxia-induced lethality. Here, we aimed to evaluate the protective effects of edaravone against hypoxia-induced lethality and oxidative stress in mice through three experimental models of hypoxia.\n\nMaterials and Methodsmale Swiss albino mice were randomly housed in groups of 10. Mice received single i.p. injections of edaravone for four consecutive days. Three experimental models of hypoxia: asphyctic, circulatory, and haemic were applied in this study. Oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and glutathione content were assessed after hypoxia induction.\n\nResultsSignificant protective activities were observed in all models of hypoxia. Antihypoxic activities were highly significant in asphytic and circulatory hypoxia. These effects were dose-dependent. Edaravone, at 5 mg kg-1, showed statistically significant activities concerning the control groups. Edaravone significantly prolonged the latency for death. At 2.5 mg kg-1, it prolonged survival time (26.08 {+/-} 0.79 min). This effect was statistically significant (P<0.05). Also, edaravone significantly inhibited hypoxia-induced oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation and glutathione oxidation) in three models of hypoxia.\n\nConclusionsEdaravone showed an excellent protective effect against hypoxia in all tested models and decreased the oxidative stress in the brain tissue of hypoxic mice. Notably, results showed significant and dose-dependent effects on the models of asphytic and circulatory hypoxia. The antioxidant activity itself might be a proposed mechanism for the antihypoxic activities of this drug.\n\nImpact statementThis study provides a novel proof-of-concept for a FDA approved drug, which will open a new area of research in the field and drug repurposing.",

Despite many works, nothing is known about the protective effects of MgSO4 against hypoxia-induced lethality and oxidative damage in brain mitochondria. In this study, antihypoxic and antioxidative activities of MgSO4 were evaluated by three experimental models of induced-hypoxia (asphyctic, haemic, and circulatory) in mice. Mitochondria protective effects of MgSO4 were evaluated in mice brain after induction of different models of hypoxia. Antihypoxic activity was especially pronounced in asphyctic hypoxia where MgSO4 at dose 600 mg/kg showed the same activity as phenytoin which used as a positive control (P&lt; 0.001). In the haemic model, MgSO4 at all used doses significantly prolonged latency of death. In circulatory hypoxia, MgSO4 (600 mg/kg) doubles the survival time. MgSO4 significantly decreased Lipid peroxidation, protein carbonyl, and improved mitochondrial function and glutathione content in brain mitochondria compared to control groups. The results obtained in this study showed that MgSO4 administration has protective effects against lethality induced by different models of hypoxia and improves brain mitochondria oxidative damage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

The two groups show sequential roles during neurodevelopment with broadly-expressed genes modulating chromatin remodeling, proliferation, and cell fate, while brain-specific risk genes are involved in neural maturation and synapse functioning. Broadly-expressed risk genes converge onto brain-specific risk genes and core neurodevelopmental genes through regulatory networks including PI3K/AKT, RAS/ERK, and WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling pathways. Broadly-expressed and brain-specific risk genes show unique properties, wherein the broadly-expressed risk gene network is expressed prenatally and conserved in non-neuronal cells like microglia. However, the brain-specific gene network expression is limited to excitatory and inhibitory neurons, spanning prenatal to adulthood. Furthermore, the two groups are linked differently to comorbidities associated with ASD. Collectively, we describe here the organization of the genetic architecture of ASD as a hierarchy of broadly-expressed and brain-specific genes that disrupt successive stages of core neurodevelopmental processes.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal environment is unique because it supports the intestinal epithelial cells under a normal oxygen environment and the microbiota under an anoxic environment. Due to importance of understanding the interactions between the epithelium and the microbiota, there is a strong need for developing representative and simple experimental models. Current approaches do not capture the dual-oxygen environment, require external anaerobic chambers, or are complex. Another major limitation is that in the solutions that can mimic the dual-oxygen environment, the oxygenation level of the epithelial cells is not known, raising the question whether the cells are hypoxic. We report standalone microfluidic devices that form a dual-oxygen environment without the use of an external anaerobic chamber or oxygen scavengers to coculture intestinal epithelial and bacterial cells. By changing the thickness of the device cover, the oxygen tension in the chamber could be modulated. We verified the oxygen levels using several tests: microscale oxygen sensitive sensors incorporated within the devices, hypoxic immunostaining of Caco-2 cells, and genetically encoded bacteria. Collectively, these methods monitored oxygen concentrations in devices more comprehensively than previous reports and allowed for control of oxygen tension to match the requirements of both intestinal cells and anaerobic bacteria. Our experimental model is supported by the mathematical model that considers diffusion of oxygen into the top chamber and the cellular oxygen consumption rate. This allowed us to experimentally determine the oxygen consumption rate of the epithelial cells more precisely.",

    "abstract": "The accurate measurement of brain activity by Brain-Machine-Interfaces (BMI) and closed-loop Deep Brain Stimulators (DBS) is one of the most important steps in communicating between the brain and subsequent processing blocks. In conventional chest-mounted systems, frequently used in DBS, a significant amount of artifact can be induced in the sensing interface, often as a common-mode signal applied between the case and the sensing electrodes. Attenuating this common-mode signal can be a serious challenge in these systems due to finite commonmode-rejection-ratio (CMRR) capability in the interface. Emerging BMI and DBS devices are being developed which can mount on the skull. Mounting the system on the cranial region can potentially suppress these induced physiological signals by limiting the artifact amplitude. In this study, we model the effect of artifacts by focusing on cardiac activity, using a current-source dipole model in a torso-shaped volume conductor. Performing finite element simulation with the different DBS architectures, we estimate the ECG common mode artifacts for several device architectures. Using this model helps define the overall requirements for the total system CMRR to maintain resolution of brain activity. The results of the simulations estimate that the cardiac artifacts for skull-mounted systems will have a significantly lower effect than non-cranial systems that include the pectoral region. It is expected that with a pectoral mounted device, a minimum of 60-80 dB CMRR is required to suppress the ECG artifact, while in cranially-mounted devices, a 20 dB CMRR is sufficient, in the worst-case scenario. The methods used for estimating cardiac artifacts can be extended to other sources such as motion/muscle sources. The susceptibility of the device to artifacts has significant implications for the practical translation of closed-loop DBS and BMI, including the choice of biomarkers and the design requirements for insulators and lead systems.",

    "abstract": "Climate and plant litter diversity are major determinants of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling rates during decomposition. Yet, how these processes will be modified with combined changes in climate and biodiversity is poorly understood. With a multisite field experiment, we studied the interactive effects of summer drought (using rainout shelters) and tree species mixing in beech forests in the French Alps. Forests included monospecific stands of Fagus sylvatica, Abies alba, and Quercus pubescens and two-species mixtures composed of beech and one of the other species. We hypothesized (1) negative effects of summer drought on C and N loss during decomposition and (2) mitigation of these negative effects in mixed tree species stands. Litter lost 35% of initial C, and 15% of N on average across all sites and litter types over 30 months of decomposition. Summer drought consistently, but weakly, reduced C loss but had no effect on N loss. Tree species mixing did not alter drought effects on decomposition but had non-additive effects on C and N loss, which were dominated by direct litter mixing rather than indirect tree canopy effects. Our data suggest relatively small drought effects on decomposition, possibly because process rates are generally slow during summer and because microsite variability exceeds that in response to rain exclusion. The dominant contribution of litter mixing to biodiversity effects supports the importance of microsite conditions for C and N dynamics during decomposition, which should be accounted for more explicitly in climate and biodiversity change predictions.",

    "abstract": "Population dynamics has been modelled using differential equations almost since Malthus times, more than two centuries ago. Basic ingredients of population dynamics models are typically a growth rate, a saturation term in the form of Verhulsts logistic brake, and a functional response accounting for interspecific interactions. However intraspecific interactions are not usually included in the equations. The simplest models use linear terms to represent a simple picture of the nature, meanwhile to represent more complex landscapes, it is necessary to include more terms with higher order or analytically more complex. The problem to use a simpler or more complex model depends on many factors: mathematical, ecological, or computational. To address it, here we discuss a new model based on a previous logistic-mutualistic model. We have generalised the interspecific terms (for antagonistic and competitive relationships) and we have also included new polynomial terms to explain any intraspecific interaction. We show that by adding simple intraspecific terms, new free-equilibrium solutions appear driving a much richer dynamics. These new solutions could represent more realistic ecological landscapes by including a new high order term.",

This pattern of constrained space-use is thought to result from the foraging benefits of memorizing the locations and quality of heterogeneously distributed resources. However, due to the confounding effects of sensory perception, the role of memory in home range movement behavior lacks unequivocal evidence in the wild. Here, we analyze the foraging decisions of a large mammal during a field resource manipulation experiment designed to disentangle the effects of memory and perception. Using a cognitive movement model, we demonstrate that roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) rely on memory, not perception, to track the spatio-temporal dynamics of resources within their home range. Our findings show a memory-based spatial transition model parametrized with experimental data can successfully be used to quantify cognitive processes and to predict how animals respond to resource heterogeneity in space and time.",

Isw2 is an enzyme that has been previously defined as a genome-wide, non-specific nucleosome spacing factor. Here, we show that Isw2 instead acts as an obligately targeted nucleosome remodeler in vivo through physical interactions with sequence-specific factors. We demonstrate that Isw2-recruiting factors use small and previously uncharacterized epitopes, which direct Isw2 activity through highly conserved acidic residues in the Isw2 accessory protein Itc1. This interaction orients Isw2 on target nucleosomes, allowing for precise nucleosome positioning at targeted loci. Finally, we show that these critical acidic residues have been lost in the Drosophila lineage, potentially explaining the inconsistently characterized function of Isw2-like proteins. Altogether, these data suggest an \"interacting barrier model\" where Isw2 interacts with a sequence-specific factor to accurately and reproducibly position a single, targeted nucleosome to define the precise border of phased chromatin arrays.",

    "abstract": "Tillering is an important biomass yield component trait in switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.). Teosinte branched 1 (tb1)/Branched 1 (BRC1) gene is a known regulator for tillering/branching in several plant species; however, its role on tillering in switchgrass remains unknown. Here, we report physiological and molecular characterization of mutants created by CRISPR/Cas9. We successfully obtained non-chimeric Pvtb1a and Pvtb1b mutants from chimeric T0 mutants using nodal culture. The biallelic Pvtb1a-Pvtb1b mutant plants produced significantly more tillers and higher fresh weight biomass than the wild-type plants. The increased tiller production in the mutant plants resulted primarily from hastened outgrowth of lower axillary buds. Increased tillers were also observed in transgene-free T1 monoallelic mutants for either Pvtb1a-Pvtb1b or Pvtb1b gene alone, suggesting Pvtb1 genes act in a dosage-dependent manner. Transcriptome analysis showed 831 genes were differentially expressed in the Pvtb1a-Pvtb1b double knockdown mutant. Gene Ontology analysis revealed downregulation of Pvtb1 genes affected multiple biological processes, including transcription, flower development, cell differentiation, and stress/defense responses in edited plants. This study demonstrates that Pvtb1 genes play a pivotal role in tiller production as a negative regulator in switchgrass and provides opportunities for further research aiming to elucidate the molecular pathway regulating tillering in switchgrass.\n\nHighlightSolid non-chimeric mutants were successfully isolated from CRISPR/Cas9-induced chimeric mutants using nodal culture.

These models enable extensive explorations of the chemical space, and provide a platform for molecular optimization. However, current state of the art methods do not leverage the structure of the target, which is known to play a key role in the interaction.\n\nWe propose an optimization pipeline that leverages complementary structure-based and ligand-based methods. Instead of performing docking on a fixed drug bank, we iteratively select promising compounds in the whole chemical space using a ligand-centered generative model. Molecular docking is then used as an oracle to guide compound optimization. This allows to iteratively generate leads that better fit the target structure, in a closed optimization loop, without prior knowledge about bio-actives. For this purpose, we introduce a new graph to selfies VAE which benefits from a seventeen times faster decoding than graph to graph methods while being competitive with the state of the art. We then successfully optimize the generation of molecules towards high docking scores, enabling a ten-fold augmentation of high-scoring compounds found with a fixed computational budget.\n\nAvailabilityCode is available on GitHub\n\nContactjeromew@mcgill.ca",

In the absence of hypoxia-induced SETX, R-loop levels increase, DNA damage accumulates, and DNA replication rates decrease. SETX plays a key role in protecting cells from DNA damage induced during transcription in hypoxia. Importantly, we show that the mechanism of SETX induction is reliant on the PERK/ATF4 arm of the unfolded protein response.

We report a DNA methylation dependent decrease of histone H3 variant H3.3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development and an increase in the level of the H3.2 variant. The loss of H3.3 correlates with a decrease in the histone PTMs associated with active transcription. The overexpression of H3.3 and H3.2 did not affect global PTMs and cell physiology, probably owing to the deregulation of specific histone chaperones CAF-1 (for H3.2) and HIRA (for H3.3) that we observed in HCC. Notably, upon P150 (CAF-1 subunit) knockdown in HCC cell lines, a cell cycle arrest in S-phase was observed, possibly due to the decrease in the histone levels necessary for DNA packaging. Furthermore, H3.3 knockdown in a preneoplastic liver cell line led to an increase in cell proliferation and a decreased transcription of tumor suppressor genes, recapitulating the tumor cell phenotype. Importantly, our data suggest that the use of DNA Methyl Transferase (DNMT) and Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors to restore the expression of H3.3 and the altered chromatin state for the better clinical management of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The complex structure of insect exoskeleton has inspired material scientists and engineers. Chitin is a major component of the cuticle and it is synthesized by the enzyme chitin synthase. There is a single chitin synthase gene (kkv) in Drosophila facilitating research on the function of chitin. Previous editing of kkv lead to the recovery of a viable hypomorphic allele. Experiments described in this paper argue that a reduction in chitin synthase leads to the shafts of sensory bristles becoming fragile and frequently breaking off as the animals age. This is likely due to reduced chitin levels and further suggests that chitin plays a role in resilience of insect cuticle. The different layers in cuticle are continuous across the many epidermal cells that secrete the cuticle that covers the body. Little is known about the mechanisms responsible for this continuity. Using genetic mosaics and scanning electron microscopy this paper establishes that kkv shows short range cell non-autonomy. It also provides evidence for 2 possible mechanisms. One is the intercellular transfer of Kkv protein from one cell to its neighbors and the second is the deposition of cuticular material across the boundaries of neighboring cells.",

    "abstract": "The physiology of tropical birds is poorly understood, particularly in how it relates to local climate and changes between seasons. This is particularly true of tropical montane species, which may have sensitive thermal tolerances to local microclimates. We studied metabolic rates (using open flow respirometry), body mass and haemoglobin concentrations of five sedentary Mesoamerican songbirds between the summer and winter at two elevations (1550 m and 1950 m, respectively). We asked whether there were uniform seasonal shifts in physiological traits across species, and whether higher elevation species displayed evidence for cold tolerance. Seasonal shifts in metabolic rates differed between the three species for which data were collected. Basal metabolic rates in one species - black-headed nightingalethrushes Catharus mexicanus - were up-regulated in summer (~19% increase of winter metabolism), however two other species displayed no seasonal regulation. No species exhibited shifts in haemoglobin concentrations across season or across elevation, whereas body mass in two species was significantly higher in the summer. One species restricted to higher elevations - ruddy-capped nightingale-thrushes C. frantzii - displayed physiological traits indicative of cold-tolerance. Although only summer data were available for this species (C. frantzii), metabolic rates were constant across temperatures tested (5-34{degrees}C) and haemoglobin concentrations were significantly higher compared to the other four species. Our results suggest that seasonal acclimatisation in physiological traits is variable between species and appear unrelated to changes in local climate. As such, the distinct physiological traits observed in ruddy-capped nightingale-thrushes likely relate to historic isolation and conserved physiological traits rather than contemporary climatic adaption.",

    "abstract": "Biomedical and clinical sciences are experiencing a renewed interest in the fact that males and females differ in many anatomic, physiological, and behavioral traits. Sex differences in trait variability, however, are yet to receive similar recognition. In medical science, mammalian females are assumed to have higher trait variability due to estrous cycles (the  estrus-mediated variability hypothesis); historically in biomedical research, females have been excluded for this reason. Contrastingly, evolutionary theory and associated data support the  greater male variability hypothesis. Here, we test these competing hypotheses in 218 traits measured in >26,900 mice, using meta-analysis methods. Neither hypothesis could universally explain patterns in trait variability. Sex-bias in variability was trait-dependent. While greater male variability was found in morphological traits, females were much more variable in immunological traits. Sex-specific variability has eco-evolutionary ramifications including sex-dependent responses to climate change, as well as statistical implications including power analysis considering sex difference in variance.",

    "abstract": "Cyclohexanone monooxygenases (CHMO) consume molecular oxygen and NADPH to catalyze the valuable oxidation of cyclic ketones. However, CHMO usage is restricted by poor thermostability and stringent specificity for NADPH. Efforts to engineer CHMO have been limited by the sensitivity of the enzyme to perturbations in conformational dynamics and long-range interactions that cannot be predicted. We demonstrate a pair of aerobic, high-throughput growth selection platforms in Escherichia coli for oxygenase evolution, based on NADPH or NADH redox balance. We utilize the NADPH-dependent selection in the directed evolution of thermostable CHMO and discover the variant CHMO GV (A245G-A288V) with a 2.7-fold improvement in residual activity compared to the wild type after 40 {degrees}C incubation. Addition of a previously reported mutation resulted in A245G-A288V-T415C which has further improved thermostability at 45 {degrees}C. We apply the NADH-dependent selection to alter the cofactor specificity of CHMO to accept NADH, a less expensive cofactor than NADPH. We identified the variant CHMO DTNP (S208D-K326T-K349N-L143P) with a 21-fold cofactor specificity switch from NADPH to NADH compared to the wild type. Molecular modeling indicates that CHMO GV experiences more favorable residue packing and backbone torsions, and CHMO DTNP activity is driven by cooperative fine-tuning of cofactor contacts. Our introduced tools for oxygenase evolution enable the rapid engineering of properties critical to industrial scalability.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) is one of the most basic tools available for the detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) which has evolved as one of the major causes of death in recent times, spanning countries. Conventionally, ECGs are printed on graph sheets which keep fading away with time. Hence, the preservation of ECG graph sheets is difficult. Digitization of printed ECG graph sheets is a solution to this problem. Digitization also helps in faster analysis and interpretation of ECG signals. Although the previous works have succeeded in smoothing ECG after extracting the signal from graph sheet, the cost amounts to loss of peak amplitude characteristics leading to wrong diagnosis. In this work, we propose a digitization technique to extract ECG signals from graph sheets. The proposed bilateral filter based method achieves a high degree of smoothness with all the peak characteristics intact when compared to other implementations using Butterworth filters. With this technique, it is now possible to create extensive databases similar to MIT-BIH from printed ECG graph sheets. A high level of automation is achieved, and results verified with over 60 ECGs and compared.",

    "abstract": "The choice of preprocessing pipeline introduces variability in neuroimaging analyses that affects the reproducibility of scientific findings. Features derived from structural and functional MR imaging data are sensitive to the algorithmic or parametric differences of preprocessing tasks, such as image normalization, registration, and segmentation to name a few. Therefore it is critical to understand and potentially mitigate the cumulative biases of pipelines in order to distinguish biological effects from methodological variance. Here we use an open structural MR imaging dataset (ABIDE), supplemented with the Human Connectome Project (HCP), to highlight the impact of pipeline selection on cortical thickness measures. Specifically, we investigate the effect of 1) software tool (e.g. ANTs, CIVET, FreeSurfer), 2) cortical parcellation (DKT, Destrieux, Glasser), and 3) quality control procedure (manual, automatic). We divide our statistical analyses by 1) method type, i.e. task-free (unsupervised) versus task-driven (supervised), and 2) inference objective, i.e. neurobiological group differences versus individual prediction. Results show that software, parcellation, and quality control significantly impact task-driven neurobiological inference. Additionally, software selection strongly impacts neurobiological and individual task-free analyses, and quality control alters the performance for the individual-centric prediction tasks. This comparative performance evaluation partially explains the source of inconsistencies in neuroimaging findings. Furthermore, it underscores the need for more rigorous scientific workflows and accessible informatics resources to replicate and compare preprocessing pipelines to address the compounding problem of reproducibility in the age of large-scale, data-driven computational neuroscience.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE) are pivotal neuromodulators that regulate a broad range of brain functions, often in concert. Despite their physiological importance, untangling the relationship between DA and NE in finely controlling output functions is currently challenging, primarily due to a lack of techniques to visualize spatiotemporal dynamics with sufficiently high selectivity. Although genetically encoded fluorescent biosensors have been developed to detect DA, their poor selectivity prevents distinguishing DA from NE. Here, we report the development of a red fluorescent genetically encoded GPCR (G protein-coupled receptor)-activation reporter for DA termed  R-GenGAR-DA. More specifically, a circular permutated red fluorescent protein (cpmApple) was inserted into the third intracellular loop of human DA receptor D1 (DRD1) followed by the screening of mutants within the linkers between DRD1 and cpmApple. We developed two variants: R-GenGAR-DA1.1, which brightened following DA stimulation, and R-GenGAR-DA1.2, which dimmed. R-GenGAR-DA1.2 demonstrated reasonable dynamic range ({Delta}F/F0 = -50%) and DA affinity (EC50 = 0.7 {micro}M) as well as the highest selectivity for DA over NE (143-fold) amongst available DA biosensors. Due to its high selectivity, R-GenGAR-DA1.2 allowed dual-color fluorescence live imaging for monitoring DA and NE, combined with the existing green-NE biosensor GRABNE1m, which has high selectivity for NE over DA (>350-fold) in HeLa cells and hippocampal neurons grown from primary culture. By enabling precise measurement of DA, as well as simultaneous visualization of DA and NE, the red-DA biosensor R-GenGAR-DA1.2 is promising in advancing our understanding of the interplay between DA and NE in organizing key brain functions.\n\nSignificance StatementThe neuromodulators dopamine and norepinephrine modulate a broad range of brain functions, often in concert. One current challenge is to measure dopamine and norepinephrine dynamics simultaneously with high spatial and temporal resolution. We therefore developed a red-dopamine biosensor that has 143-fold higher selectivity for dopamine over norepinephrine. Taking advantage of its high selectivity for dopamine over norepinephrine, this red-dopamine biosensor allowed dual-color fluorescence live imaging for monitoring dopamine and norepinephrine in both HeLa cells and hippocampal neurons in vitro combined with the existing green-norepinephrine biosensor that has 350-fold selectivity for norepinephrine over dopamine. Thus, this approach can provide new opportunities to advance our understanding of high spatial and temporal dynamics of dopamine and norepinephrine in normal and abnormal brain functions.",

    "abstract": "Many aspects of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) between-farm transmission dynamics have been investigated, but uncertainty remains about the significance of farm type and different transmission routes on PRRSV spread. We developed a stochastic epidemiological model calibrated on weekly PRRSV outbreaks accounting for the population dynamics in different pig production phases, breeding herds, gilt development units, nurseries, and finisher farms, of three hog producer companies. Our model accounted for indirect contacts by the close distance between farms (local transmission), between-farm animal movements (pig flow), and reinfection of sow farms (re-break). The fitted model was used to examine the effectiveness of vaccination strategies and complementary interventions such as enhanced PRRSV detection and vaccination delays and forecast the spatial distribution of PRRSV outbreak. The results of our analysis indicated that for sow farms, 59% of the simulated infections were related to local transmission (e.g. airborne, feed deliveries, shared equipment) whereas 36% and 5% were related to animal movements and re-break, respectively. For nursery farms, 80% of infections were related to animal movements and 20% to local transmission; while at finisher farms it was split between local transmission and animal movements. Assuming that the current vaccines are 1% effective in mitigating between-farm PRRSV transmission, weaned pigs vaccination would reduce the incidence of PRRSV outbreaks by 2%, indeed under any scenario vaccination alone was insufficient for completely controlling PRRSV spread. Our results also showed that intensifying PRRSV detection and/or vaccination pigs at placement increased the effectiveness of all simulated vaccination strategies. Our model reproduced the incidence and PRRSV spatial distribution; therefore, this model could also be used to map current and future farms at-risk. Finally, this model could be a useful tool for veterinarians, allowing them to identify the effect of transmission routes and different vaccination interventions to control PRRSV spread.",

    "abstract": "A general method to infer both positive and purifying selection during the real-time evolution of hypermutator pathogens would be broadly useful. To this end, we introduce a simple test to infer mode of selection (STIMS) from metagenomic time series of evolving microbial populations. We test STIMS on metagenomic data generated by simulations of bacterial evolution, and on metagenomic data spanning 62,750 generations of Lenskis long-term evolution experiment with Escherichia coli (LTEE). In both cases, STIMS recovers signals of positive and purifying selection on gold standard sets of genes. Using STIMS, we find strong evidence of ongoing positive selection on key regulators of the E. coli gene regulatory network, even in some hypermutator populations. STIMS also detects positive selection on regulatory genes in hypermutator populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that adapted to subinhibitory concentrations of colistin - an antibiotic of last resort - for just twenty-six days of laboratory evolution. Our results show that the fine-tuning of gene regulatory networks is a general mechanism for rapid and ongoing adaptation. The simplicity of STIMS, together with its intuitive visual interpretation, make it a useful test for positive and purifying selection in metagenomic data sets that track the evolution of hypermutator populations in real-time.",

Collation of recent data after World War II by the Human Mortality Database allowed analyses, previously unattainable, of modal death-ages for sufficient numbers of selected European cohorts. The aim was to track modes and medians/means ([&ge;]60 years old (y)) of all-cause mortality for both sexes. The only highest-quality, large-number Lexis data available were analyzed: from nine countries: Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland; raw-data modes (and medians/means [&ge;]60y, plus thin-plate-spline averages), were analyzed, plus pooled data. Here we show that for cohorts 1880-[~]1900 dramatic sex differences existed between death-age changes with all countries except Iceland showing male modal negative trends lasting [~]10-20 years and medians in all countries near-constant or negative lasting [~]10-20 years; whereas females from most countries showed fairly constant positive trends (except Finnish modes and Norwegian medians). For cohorts [~]1900-1919 male and female modal trends were positive (except Dutch and Icelandic cohorts and Finnish females). The net results were that male mortality modes for Danish, Icelandic, Italian, Dutch, Swedish and Norwegian 1919 cohorts were roughly the same as for 1880 cohorts, whereas female death-age modes increased. Results clarify previously knowledge concerning sex differences during this period. Despite improved environment in late adulthood over this period, this did not translate into increased male longevity and earlier events might have sealed their fate, especially in Denmark, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, aand Sweden (and, later, Iceland).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe activity of a transcription factor (TF) in a sample of cells is the extent to which it is exerting its regulatory potential. Many methods of inferring TF activity from gene expression data have been described, but due to the lack of appropriate large-scale datasets, systematic and objective validation has not been possible until now.\n\nResultsUsing a new dataset, we systematically evaluate and optimize the approach to TF activity inference in which a gene expression matrix is factored into a condition-independent matrix of control strengths and a condition-dependent matrix of TF activity levels. These approaches require a TF network map, which specifies the target genes of each TF, as input. We evaluate different approaches to building the network map and deriving constraints on the matrices. We find that such constraints are essential for good performance. Constraints can be obtained from expression data in which the activities of individual TFs have been perturbed, and we find that such data are both necessary and sufficient for obtaining good performance. Remaining uncertainty about whether a TF activates or represses a target is a major source of error. To a considerable extent, control strengths inferred using expression data from one growth condition carry over to other conditions. As a result, the control strength matrices derived here can be used for other applications. Finally, we apply these methods to gain insight into the upstream factors that regulate the activities of four yeast TFs: Gcr2, Gln3, Gcn4, and Msn2. Evaluation code and data available at https://github.com/BrentLab/TFA-evaluation\n\nConclusionsWhen a high-quality network map, constraints, and perturbation-response data are available, inferring TF activity levels by factoring gene expression matrices is effective. Furthermore, it provides insight into regulators of TF activity.",

    "abstract": "The trans-activation response DNA-binding protein TDP-43 regulates RNA processing and forms neuropathological aggregates in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Investigating TDP-43 post-translational modifications, we discovered that K84 acetylation reduced nuclear import whereas K136 acetylation impaired RNA binding and splicing capabilities of TDP-43. Such failure of RNA interaction triggered TDP-43 phase separation mediated by the C-terminal low complexity domain, leading to the formation of insoluble aggregates with pathologically phosphorylated and ubiquitinated TDP-43. Confirming the results from site-directed mutagenesis, we succeeded to introduce authentic acetyl-lysine at the identified sites via amber suppression. [AcK84]TDP-43 showed cytoplasmic mislocalization and the aggregation propensity of [acK136]TDP-43 was confirmed. With newly developed antibodies, we found that the nuclear sirtuin SIRT1 can potently deacetylate [acK136]TDP-43. Moreover, SIRT1 reduced the aggregation propensity of [acK136]TDP-43. Thus, distinct lysine acetylations modulate nuclear import, RNA binding and phase separation of TDP-43, suggesting novel regulatory mechanisms for TDP-43 pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Chordates are divided into three subphyla: Vertebrata, Tunicata and Cephalochordata. Phylogenetically, the Cephalochordata, more commonly known as lancelets or amphioxus, constitute the sister group of Vertebrata and Tunicata. Lancelets are small, benthic, marine filter feeders, and their roughly three dozen described species are divided into three genera: Branchiostoma, Epigonichthys and Asymmetron. Due to their phylogenetic position and their stereotypical chordate morphology and genome architecture, lancelets are key models for understanding the evolutionary history of chordates. Lancelets have thus been studied by generations of scientists, with the first descriptions of adult anatomy and developmental morphology dating back to the 19th century. Today, several different lancelet species are used as laboratory models, predominantly for developmental, molecular and genomic studies. Surprisingly, however, a universal staging system and an unambiguous nomenclature for developing lancelets have not yet been adopted by the scientific community.\n\nIn this work, we characterized the development of the European amphioxus (Branchiostoma lanceolatum) using confocal microscopy and compiled a streamlined developmental staging system, from fertilization through larval life, including an unambiguous stage nomenclature. By tracing growth curves of the European amphioxus reared at different temperatures, we were able to show that our staging system permitted an easy conversion of any developmental time into a specific stage name. Furthermore, comparisons of embryos and larvae from the European lancelet (B. lanceolatum), the Florida lancelet (B. floridae), the Chinese lancelet (B. belcheri), the Japanese lancelet (B. japonicum) and the Bahamas lancelet (Asymmetron lucayanum) demonstrated that our staging system could readily be applied to other lancelet species.\n\nAlthough the detailed staging description was carried out on developing B. lanceolatum, the comparisons with other lancelet species thus strongly suggested that both staging and nomenclature are applicable to all extant lancelets. We conclude that this description of embryonic and larval development will be of great use for the scientific community and that it should be adopted as the new standard for defining and naming developing lancelets. More generally, we anticipate that this work will facilitate future studies comparing representatives from different chordate lineages.",

    "abstract": "Saxicolella Engl., an African genus of the waterfall specialist plant family Podostemaceae, was shown to be polyphyletic as currently delimited. One clade, sampled from species in Ghana, is sister to American Ceratolacis (Tul.)Wedd., Podostemum Michx. and all Old World Podostemoideae (podostemoids). The second clade, sampled from Cameroonian material, was embedded within the major clade of African podostemoids. In this paper the generic nomenclature applied to Saxicolella sensu lato (Saxicolella, Pohliella Engl., Aulea Lebrun & Stork nom. inval.), is reviewed and the morphological support for the two clades and their correct generic names is determined. Pohliella is shown to be the correct name for the first clade (based on Pohliella laciniata Engl., Cameroon) and a synoptic treatment of its three published species is given, one of which is extinct, and two are threatened. However, a fourth, unpublished species exists. The new combinations Pohliella submersa (J.B.Hall) Cheek and Pohliella amicorum (J.B. Hall) Cheek are made for the two published Ghanaian species. The recently described New World genus Cipoia C.T. Philbrick, Novelo & Irgang is revealed as being morphologically identical to Pohliella, but in view of the geographical disjunction, confirmation from molecular evidence is awaited before its two species are also transferred to Pohliella. The correct name for the second clade, embedded in African podostemoids, is Saxicolella (sensu stricto), now with two known species, Saxicolella nana Engl. (type of Saxicolella, Cameroon) and Saxicolella flabellata (G.Taylor) C. Cusset (Nigeria).",

    "abstract": "Epistasis is often used to probe functional relationships between genes, and it plays an important role in evolution. However, we lack theory to understand how functional relationships at the molecular level translate into epistasis at the level of whole-organism phenotypes, such as fitness. Here, I derive two rules for how epistasis between mutations with small effects propagates from lower-to higher-level phenotypes in a hierarchical metabolic network with first-order kinetics and how such epistasis depends on topology. Most importantly, weak epistasis at a lower level may be distorted as it propagates to higher levels. Computational analyses show that epistasis in more realistic models likely follows similar, albeit more complex, patterns. These results suggest that pairwise inter-gene epistasis should be common and it should generically depend on the genetic background and environment. Furthermore, the epistasis coefficients measured for high-level phenotypes may not be sufficient to fully infer the underlying functional relationships.",

    "abstract": "Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a vital role in coordinating physiological processes during fresh fruit ripening. ABA can bind to ABA receptors which interacts and inhibits their co-receptors type 2C phosphatases (PP2Cs). However, the dissected mechanism of PP2C during fruit ripening is unclear. In this study, we identify the role of SlPP2C3, a tomato type 2C phosphatase, as a negative regulator of ABA signaling and fruit ripening. SlPP2C3 selectively interacted with monomeric ABA receptors and SlSnRK2.8 kinase in both yeast and tobacco epidermal cells. Expressions of SlPP2C3 were observed in all tissues, and it negatively correlated with the fruit ripening which was induced by exogenous ABA. Tomato plants with suppressed SlPP2C3 expression exhibited enhanced sensitivity to ABA, while SlPP2C3 over-expressed plants were less sensitive to ABA. Meaningfully, lack of SlPP2C3 expression causes the acceleration of fruit ripening onset via the alternation of ABA signaling activity, and the fruit gloss is affected by the changes of outer epidermis structure. RNA-seq analysis found significant different expression of cuticle-related genes in pericarp between wild-type and SlPP2C3 suppressed lines. Taken together, our finding demonstrate that SlPP2C3 plays an important role in the regulation of fruit ripening and fruit appearance quality in tomato.",

Evolutionary dynamics, gene-specific phylogeny and emergence of the novel co-evolving mutations in nine structural and non-structural genes among circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains in ten states of India have been assessed.\n\nMaterials and methods46 SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide sequences submitted from India were downloaded from the GISAID (39/46) or from NCBI (7/46) database. Phylogenetic study and analyses of mutation were based on the nine structural and non-structural genes of SARS-CoV-2 strains. Secondary structure of RdRP/NSP12 protein was predicted with respect to the novel A97V mutation.\n\nResultsPhylogenetic analyses revealed the evolution of \"genome-type clusters\" and adaptive selection of \"L\" type SARS-CoV-2 strains with genetic closeness to the bat SARS-like coronaviruses than pangolin or MERS-CoVs. With regards to the novel co-evolving mutations, 2 groups are seen to circulate in India at present: the \"major group\" (52.2%) and the \"minor group\" (30.4%), harboring four and five co-existing mutations, respectively. The \"major group\" mutations fall in the A2a clade. All the minor group mutations, except 11083G>T (L37F, NSP6) were unique to the Indian isolates.\n\nConclusionThe study highlights rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus and co-circulation of multiple clades and sub-clades, driving this pandemic worldwide. This comprehensive study is a potential resource for monitoring the novel mutations in the viral genome, changes in viral pathogenesis, for designing vaccines and other therapeutics.",

Even when we followed a standard protocol for 2DE we got lesser number of proteins focused especially in the basic region of the IPG strip. Since the common troubleshooting measures did not solve the problem we replaced the protease inhibitor cocktail in the lysis buffer with PMSF which resulted in an ideal protein map following 2DE. We also found that the presence of the cocktail results in skewing of the mass spectra of a purified protein which eventually resulted in incorrect identification of the protein by MASCOT search. Later we found that dimethyl sulfoxide, the solvent of protease inhibitor cocktail also resulted in focusing of lesser number of proteins. Addition of 1% dimethyl sulfoxide to bovine serum albumin resulted in lesser sequence coverage for the protein by LC-MS/MS. Also, dimethyl sulfoxide was found to decrease the intensity value of the dominant peptide in a fraction when MALDI-TOF-TOF was done. Even though we do not provide a reason behind our observations, we guess dimethyl sulfoxide might have changed the charge distribution of peptides or proteins resulting in the peculiar observations we had.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is the current pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that uses ACE2 protein on the cell surface. By analyzing publicly available datasets, I uncovered that alveolar early progenitors (AEP), a subset of the type-2 pneumocytes, showed increased ACE2 expression in the older lungs. AEPs co-express TMPRSS2, CTSL. Aged AEP-gene expression signature suggested an active response to beta-amyloid-induced ACE2 shedding, to limit the intercellular beta-amyloid accumulation in otherwise healthy human lungs. Susceptibility of AEP to SARS-CoV2 and ACE2 secretory capacity of these cells makes aged human lung sensitive for rapid-infection, by a possible in-solution ACE2 binding and entry into ACE2-negative cells, thereby increasing the target cell diversity and numbers. Single-cell analysis of COVID19 patients with moderate and severe infections, clearly showed that severe infections showed SARS-CoV-2 transcript in ACE2-negative TMPRSS-negative but CTSL-positive cell types in their bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, validating in-solution ACE2-binding enabling infection.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian cell surface is decorated with a plethora of integral membrane proteins including those required for the transport of micronutrients, such as copper, which are essential to cellular health. The concentration of micronutrients within the cell is tightly regulated to avoid their adverse deficiency and toxicity effects. The sorting and recycling of nutrients transporters within the endo-lysosomal network is recognised as an essential process in regulating nutrient balance. The evolutionarily conserved endosomal sorting complex, retromer, coordinates integral membrane protein recognition and retrieval. Cellular copper homeostasis is regulated primarily by two transporters: the major copper influx transporter copper transporter 1 (CTR1/SLC31A1), which controls the uptake of copper from the extracellular environment and is essential for early embryonic development, and the established retromer cargo, the copper-transporting ATPase, ATP7A. Here, we show that in response to fluctuating extracellular copper the retromer complex controls the delivery of CTR1 to the cell surface. Following copper exposure, CTR1 is endocytosed to prevent excessive copper uptake. We reveal that internalised CTR1 localises on retromer-positive endosomes and in response to decreased extracellular copper retromer controls the recycling of CTR1 back to the cell surface to maintain copper homeostasis. In addition to copper, CTR1 plays a central role in platinum uptake. Significantly, the efficacy of platinum-based cancer drugs has been correlated with CTR1 expression. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that retromer-deficient cells show reduced sensitivity to the platinum-based drug, cisplatin.",

    "abstract": "Acute and chronic inflammatory pathologies involve misregulation of macrophage functions. Physiologically, macrophages are immune sentinels that initiate inflammatory responses via the transcription factor NF{kappa}B. The temporal pattern of NF{kappa}B activity determines which genes are expressed, suggesting that a temporal signaling code specifies a stimulus-appropriate immune response. To identify the signaling codewords, we developed tools to enable high-throughput analysis of live, primary macrophages responding to host- and pathogen-derived stimuli. An information-theoretic workflow identified six dynamical features that constitute codewords that convey stimulus information to the nucleus. In particular, \"oscillatory\" trajectories are a hallmark of the responses to host cytokine TNF. Remarkably, examining macrophages derived from a systemic autoimmune disease model suggests that confusion of two NF{kappa}B signaling codewords, and thus miscoding of TNF as a pathogen-derived stimulus, may underlie sporadic inflammatory pathology. Overall, this study identifies six codewords of the temporal NF{kappa}B signaling code for classifying immune threats and demonstrates their biological significance.",

MMD-associated SNPs primarily localize to the C-terminal region of RNF213, and some affect conserved residues in the RING domain. Although the autosomal dominant inheritance of MMD could most easily be explained by RNF213 gain-of-function, the type of ubiquitylation catalyzed by RNF213 and the effects of MMD-associated SNPs on its E3-ligase activity have remained unclear. We found that the RING domain of RNF213 uses the E2-conjugating enzyme UBE2D2 to catalyze predominantly K6-dependent poly-ubiquitination events comprising a mixture of typical and atypical ubiquitin linkages. MMD-associated SNPs encode proteins with decreased E3-ligase activity and the most frequent MMD allele, RNF213R4810K, is a dominant negative mutant that decreases ubiquitylation globally. By contrast, MMD-associated RNF213 SNPs do not affect ATPase activity. We propose that decreased RNF213 E3-ligase activity is central to MMD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease that causes fatal disorders including severe pneumonia. To develop a therapeutic drug for COVID-19, a model that can reproduce the viral life cycle and evaluate the drug efficacy of anti-viral drugs is essential. In this study, we established a method to generate human bronchial organoids (hBO) from commercially available cryopreserved human bronchial epithelial cells and examined whether they could be used as a model for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) research. Our hBO contain basal, club, ciliated, and goblet cells. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, and transmembrane serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2), which is an essential serine protease for priming spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2, were highly expressed. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, not only the intracellular viral genome, but also progeny virus, cytotoxicity, pyknotic cells, and moderate increases of the type I interferon signal could be observed. Treatment with camostat, an inhibitor of TMPRSS2, reduced the viral copy number to 2% of the control group. Furthermore, the gene expression profile in SARS-CoV-2-infected hBO was obtained by performing RNA-seq analysis. In conclusion, we succeeded in generating hBO that can be used for SARS-CoV-2 research and COVID-19 drug discovery.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/115600v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (99K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13a6908org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c59300org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@362167org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cb31ed_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The balance between hematopoietic progenitors and differentiated hemocytes is finely tuned during development. In the larval hematopoietic organ of Drosophila, called the lymph gland, the receptor tyrosine kinase Pvr signals from differentiated cells to maintain a pool of undifferentiated progenitors. However, little is known about the processes that support Pvr function. The small GTPase Ral is involved in the regulation of several membrane trafficking events. Drosophila has a single Ral protein, Rala, which has been implicated in the development of various tissues. Here, we investigated the involvement of Rala in the larval fly hematopoietic system. We discovered that the loss of Rala activity phenocopies Pvr loss of function by promoting hemocyte progenitor differentiation. Moreover, using epistasis analysis, we found that the guanine exchange factor RalGPS lies upstream of Rala in this event, whereas the exocyst and Rab11 are acting downstream. Strikingly, the loss of Rala activity leads to a considerable accumulation of Pvr at the plasma membrane, hence suggesting a trafficking defect and reduced Pvr function. Consistent with this hypothesis, Rala loss of function phenotype in the lymph gland is fully suppressed by constitutive STAT activity, which normally mediates Pvr function in the lymph gland. Together, our findings unravel a novel RalGPS-Rala-exocyst-Rab11 axis for the maintenance of lymph gland homeostasis through Pvr.",

    "abstract": "Severe COVID-19 patients can show respiratory failure, T-cell reduction, and cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which can be fatal in both young and aged patients and is a major concern of the pandemic. However, the pathogenetic mechanisms of CRS in COVID-19 are poorly understood. Here we show single cell-level mechanisms for T-cell dysregulation in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, and thereby demonstrate the mechanisms underlying T-cell hyperactivation and paralysis in severe COVID-19 patients. By in silico sorting CD4+ T-cells from a single cell RNA-seq dataset, we found that CD4+ T-cells were highly activated and showed unique differentiation pathways in the lung of severe COVID-19 patients. Notably, those T-cells in severe COVID-19 patients highly expressed immunoregulatory receptors and CD25, whilst repressing the expression of the transcription factor FOXP3 and interestingly, both the differentiation of regulatory T-cells (Tregs) and Th17 was inhibited. Meanwhile, highly activated CD4+ T-cells express PD-1 alongside macrophages that express PD-1 ligands in severe patients, suggesting that PD-1-mediated immunoregulation was partially operating. Furthermore, we show that CD25+ hyperactivated T-cells differentiate into multiple helper T-cell lineages, showing multifaceted effector T-cells with Th1 and Th2 characteristics. Lastly, we show that CD4+ T-cells, particularly CD25-expressing hyperactivated T-cells, produce the protease Furin, which facilitates the viral entry of SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, CD4+ T-cells from severe COVID-19 patients are hyperactivated and FOXP3-mediated negative feedback mechanisms are impaired in the lung, while activated CD4+ T-cells continue to promote further viral infection through the production of Furin. Therefore, our study proposes a new model of T-cell hyperactivation and paralysis that drives pulmonary damage, systemic CRS and organ failure in severe COVID-19 patients.",

Once activated, the phytochrome (phy) class of photoreceptors signal and re-deploy carbon resources to alter growth, plant architecture, and reproductive timing. Brassica rapa has been used as a crop model to test for conservation of the phytochrome-carbon network. B. rapa phyB mutants have significantly decreased or absent CO2-stimulated growth responses in seedlings, and adult plants have reduced chlorophyll levels, photosynthetic rate, stomatal index, and seed yield. Here, we examine the transcriptomic response of adult wild-type and BrphyB leaves to darkening and recovery in light. Three days of darkness was sufficient to elicit a response in wild type leaves suggesting a shift from carbon fixation and nutrient acquisition to active redistribution of cellular resources. Upon a return to light, wild-type leaves appeared to transcriptionally return to a pre-darkness state restoring a focus on nutrient acquisition. Overall, BrphyB mutant plants have a similar response with key differences in genes involved in photosynthesis and light response which deviate from the wild type transcriptional dynamics. Genes targeted to the chloroplast are especially affected. Adult BrphyB mutant plants had fewer, larger chloroplasts, further linking phytochromes, chloroplast development, photosynthetic deficiencies and optimal resource allocation.",

To demonstrate that AcrDetector can identify real Acrs precisely at the whole genome-scale we performed a cross-species validation which resulted in 71.43% of real Acrs being ranked in the top 10. We applied AcrDetector to detect Acrs in the latest data. It can accurately identify 3 Acrs, which have previously been verified experimentally.

How the Extracellular Vesicles-derived miRNAs are getting internalized and become functional in target cells is an unresolved question. We found that EV-associated miRNAs are primarily single stranded and, to become functional, get loaded with the Ago proteins present in the recipient cells without requiring host Dicer1. Following endocytosis of miRNA-containing extracellular vesicles, loading of host Ago occurs on the endosomal membrane where pH-dependent membrane fusion triggers the release of internalized miRNAs to form exogenous miRNP pool. In addition, loading of exogenous miRNA to host Ago also depends on the mitochondrial activity of recipient cells. Internalization of hepatocyte derived miR-122 containing EVs in macrophage activates the recipient cell by targeting cytokine expression. Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite known to affect endocytosis and to cause mitochondrial depolarization in infected macrophages, restricts the EV-internalization process and thereby preventing inflammatory cytokine expression and ensuring internalized pathogen survival in macrophage.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies provide novel insights into the meso-scale organization of the brain, highlighting the co-occurrence of different structures: classic assortative (modular), disassortative and core-periphery. However, the spectral properties of the brain meso-scale remain mostly unexplored. To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated how the meso-scale structure is organized across the frequency domain. We analyzed the resting state activity of healthy participants with source-localized high-density electroencephalography signals. Then, we inferred the community structure using weighted stochastic block-modelling to capture the landscape of meso-scale structures across the frequency domain. We found that meso-scale modalities were mixed over the frequency spectrum, with a core-periphery structure predominance. Nevertheless, we also highlighted a selective increase of disassortativity in the delta and theta bands, and of assortativity in the low gamma band (30-50 Hz). We further described other features of the meso-scale organization by identifying those brain regions which, at the same time, i) exhibited the highest degree of assortativity, disassortativity and core-peripheriness (i.e. participation), ii) were consistently assigned to the same community, irrespective from the granularity imposed by WSBM (i.e. granularity-invariance). We defined those brain areas as Participation and Granularity Invariant. In conclusion, we observed that the brain spontaneous activity shows frequency-specific meso-scale organization which may support spatially distributed and local information processing.",

We derived a strategy for the task that optimizes WM resources and taught it to participants. In two sessions, 14 participants who were taught this strategy performed as well as 14 participants who had trained for forty sessions without strategy instructions. To understand the mechanisms underlying the no-instruction groups improvement, participants answered questionnaires during their training period.

While theoretical accounts predict the emergence of a corresponding hierarchy of neuronal timescales, direct electrophysiological evidence across the human cortex is lacking. Here, we infer neuronal timescales from invasive intracranial recordings. Timescales increase along the principal sensorimotor-to-association axis across the entire human cortex, and scale with single-unit timescales within macaques. Cortex-wide transcriptomic analysis shows direct alignment between timescales and expression of excitation- and inhibition-related genes, as well as genes specific to voltage-gated transmembrane ion transporters. Finally, neuronal timescales are functionally dynamic: prefrontal cortex timescales expand during working memory maintenance and predict individual performance, while cortex-wide timescales compress with aging. Thus, neuronal timescales follow cytoarchitectonic gradients across the human cortex, and are relevant for cognition in both short- and long-terms, bridging microcircuit physiology with macroscale dynamics and behavior.",

SOs are observed during anesthesia and are considered to be the default cortical activity pattern.

    "abstract": "Elastic fibers containing elastin play an important role in tendon functionality, but the knowledge on presence and function of elastin during tendon healing is limited. The aim of this study was to investigate elastin content and distribution in intact and healing Achilles tendons and to understand how elastin influence the viscoelastic properties of tendons. The right Achilles tendon was completely transected in 81 Sprague-Dawley rats. Elastin content was quantified in intact and healing tendons (7, 14, and 28 days post-surgery) and elastin distribution was visualized by immunohistochemistry. Degradation of elastin by elastase incubation was used to study the role of elastin on viscoelastic properties. Mechanical testing was either performed as a cyclic test (20x 10 N) or as a creep test. We found significantly higher levels of elastin in healing tendons at all time-points compared to intact tendons (4% in healing tendons 28 days post-surgery vs 2% in intact tendons). The elastin was more widely distributed throughout the extracellular matrix in the healing tendons in contrast to the intact tendon where the distribution was not so pronounced. Elastase incubation reduced the elastin levels by approximately 30% and led to a 40-50% reduction in creep. This reduction was seen in both intact and healing tendons. Our results show that healing tendons contain more elastin and is more compliable than intact tendons. The role of elastin in tendon healing and tissue compliance indicate a protective role of elastic fibers to prevent re-injuries during early tendon healing.\n\nPLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARYTendons transfer high loads from muscles to bones during locomotion. They are primarily made by the protein collagen, a protein that provide strength to the tissues. Besides collagen, tendons also contain other building blocks such as e.g. elastic fibers. Elastic fibers contain elastin and elastin is important for the extensibility of the tendon. When a tendon is injured and ruptured the tissue heals through scar formation. This scar tissue is different from a normal intact tendon and it is important to understand how the tendons heal. Little is known about the presence and function of elastin during healing of tendon injuries. We have shown, in animal experiments, that healing tendons have higher amounts of elastin compared to intact tendons. The elastin is also spread throughout the tissue. When we reduced the levels of this protein, we discovered altered mechanical properties of the tendon. The healing tendon can normally extend quite a lot, but after elastin removal this extensibility was less obvious. The ability of the healing tissue to extend is probably important to protect the tendon from re-injuries during the first months after rupture. We therefore propose that the tendons heal with a large amount of elastin to prevent re-ruptures during early locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Local field potentials (LFPs) recorded intracranially display a range of location specific oscillatory spectra which have been related to cognitive processes. Although the exact mechanisms producing LFPs are not completely understood, it is likely that voltage-gated ion channels which produce action potentials and patterned discharges play a significant role. It is also known that antipsychotic drugs (APDs) affect LFPs spectra and a direct inhibitory effect on voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels has been reported. Additionally, Kv channels have been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, a disorder for which APDs are primary therapies. In this study we sought to: i) better characterise the effects of two APDs on LFPs and connectivity measures and ii) examine the effects of potassium channel modulators on LFPs and potential overlap of effects with APDs. Intracranial electrodes were implanted in the hippocampus (HIP) and pre-frontal cortex (PFC) of C57BL/6 mice; power spectra, coherence and phase-amplitude cross frequency coupling were measured. Drugs tested were the APDs haloperidol and clozapine as well as voltage-gated potassium channel modulators (KVMs) 4-aminopyridine(4AP), tetraethylammonium (TEA), E-4031 and retigabine. All drugs and vehicle controls were administered intraperitoneally. Both APDs and KVMs significantly reduced gamma power with the exception of 4AP, which conversely increased slow-gamma power. Clozapine and retigabine additionally reduced coherence between HIP and PFC. Phase-amplitude coupling between theta and gamma oscillations in HIP was significantly reduced by the administration of haloperidol and retigabine. These results provide previously undescribed effects of APDs on LFP properties and demonstrate novel modulation of LFP characteristics by KVMs that intriguingly overlaps with the effects of APDs. The possibility of a common mechanism of action deserves further study.",

    "abstract": "The uptake of glutamate by astrocytes actively shapes synaptic transmission, however its role in the development and plasticity of neuronal circuits remains poorly understood. The astrocytic glutamate transporter, GLT1 is the predominant source of glutamate clearance in the adult mouse cortex. Here, we examined the structural and functional development of the visual cortex in GLT1 heterozygous (HET) mice using two-photon microscopy, immunohistochemistry and slice electrophysiology. We find that though eye-specific thalamic axonal segregation is intact, binocular refinement in the primary visual cortex is disrupted. Eye-specific responses to visual stimuli in GLT1 HET mice show altered binocular matching, with abnormally high responses to ipsilateral compared to contralateral eye stimulation and a greater mismatch between preferred orientation selectivity of ipsilateral and contralateral eye responses. Furthermore, the balance of excitation and inhibition in cortical circuits is dysregulated with an increase in somatostatin positive interneurons, decrease in parvalbumin positive interneurons, and increase in dendritic spine density in the basal dendrites of layer 2/3 excitatory neurons. Monocular deprivation induces atypical ocular dominance plasticity in GLT1 HET mice, with an unusual depression of ipsilateral open eye responses; however, this change in ipsilateral responses correlates well with an upregulation of GLT1 protein following monocular deprivation. These results demonstrate that a key function of astrocytic GLT1 function during development is the experience-dependent refinement of ipsilateral eye inputs relative to contralateral eye inputs in visual cortex.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEWe show that astrocytic glutamate uptake via the transporter GLT1 is necessary for activity-dependent regulation of cortical inputs. Dysregulation of GLT1 expression and function leads to a disruption of binocular refinement and matching in visual cortex. Inputs from the ipsilateral eye are stronger, and monocular deprivation, which upregulates GLT1 expression in a homeostatic fashion, causes a paradoxical reduction of ipsilateral, non-deprived eye, responses. These results provide new evidence for the importance of glutamate transport in cortical development, function, and plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Acute caffeine intake can delay sleep initiation and reduce sleep intensity, particularly when consumed in the evening. However, it is not clear whether these sleep disturbances disappear when caffeine is continuously consumed during daytime, which is common for most coffee drinkers. To address this question, we investigated the sleep of twenty male young habitual caffeine consumers during a double-blind, randomized, crossover study including three 10-day conditions: caffeine (3 x 150 mg caffeine daily), withdrawal (3 x 150 mg caffeine for eight days, then switch to placebo), and placebo (3 x placebo daily). After nine days of continuous treatment, electroencephalographically (EEG)-derived sleep structure and intensity were recorded during a scheduled 8-h nighttime sleep episode starting 8 (caffeine condition) and 15 h (withdrawal condition) after the last caffeine intake. Upon scheduled wake up time, subjective sleep quality and caffeine withdrawal symptoms were assessed. Unexpectedly, neither polysomnography-derived total sleep time, sleep latency, sleep architecture, nor subjective sleep quality differed among placebo, caffeine, and withdrawal conditions. Nevertheless, EEG power density in the sigma frequencies (12-16 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep was reduced in both caffeine and withdrawal conditions when compared to placebo. These results indicate that daily caffeine intake in the morning and afternoon hours does not strongly impair nighttime sleep structure or subjective sleep quality in healthy good sleepers who regularly consume caffeine. The reduced EEG power density in the sigma range might represent early signs of overnight withdrawal from the continuous presence of the stimulant during the day.\n\nStatement of SignificanceCaffeine consumption is highly prevalent worldwide and has been repeatedly shown to acutely disrupt sleep, particularly when consumed after several days of abstinence or close to bedtime. However, commonly, caffeine is consumed daily and during daytime. Our well-controlled laboratory study revealed that this common pattern of intake affects nighttime sleep differently: While slow-wave sleep duration or slow-wave activity were rather similar compared to placebo, caffeine intake surprisingly reduced EEG power density in the sigma frequencies. In the light of earlier studies, this might present early signs of caffeine withdrawal which occurs due to overnight caffeine abstinence. The present findings provide novel insights into the impact of daily presence and nightly abstinence of caffeine on nighttime sleep in regular consumers.",

    "abstract": "Although practicing a task generally benefits later performance on that same task, there are individual differences in practice effects. One avenue to model such differences comes from research showing that brain networks extract functional advantages from operating in the vicinity of criticality, a state in which brain network activity is more scale-free. We hypothesized that higher scale-free signal from fMRI data, measured with the Hurst exponent (H), indicates closer proximity to critical states. We tested whether individuals with higher H during repeated task performance would show greater practice effects. In Study 1, participants performed a dual-n-back task (DNB) twice during MRI (n = 56). In Study 2, we used two runs of n-back task (NBK) data from the Human Connectome Project sample (n = 599). In Study 3, participants performed a word completion task (CAST) across 6 runs (n = 44). In all three studies, multivariate analysis was used to test whether higher H was related to greater practice-related performance improvement. Supporting our hypothesis, we found patterns of higher H that reliably correlated with greater performance improvement across participants in all three studies. However, the predictive brain regions were distinct, suggesting that the specific spatial H{uparrow} patterns are not task-general.",

    "abstract": "As animals carry out behaviors, particularly costly ones, they must constantly assess whether or not to persist in the behavior or quit. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been shown to assess the value of behaviors and to be especially sensitive to physical effort costs. Complimentary to these functions, the insula is thought to represent the internal state of the animal including factors such as hunger, thirst, and fatigue. Utilizing a novel weight lifting task for rats, we characterized the local field potential (LFP) activity of the ACC and anterior insula (AI) during effort expenditure. In the task male rats are challenged to work for sucrose reward, which costs progressively more effort over time to obtain. Rats are able to quit the task at any point. We found modest shifts in LFP theta (7-9 Hz) activity as the task got progressively more difficult in terms of absolute effort expenditure. However, when the LFP data were analyzed based on the rats relative progress towards quitting the task, or performance state, substantial shifts in LFP power in the theta and gamma (55-100 Hz) frequency bands were observed in ACC and AI. Both ACC and AI theta power decreased as the rats got closer to quitting, while ACC and AI gamma power increased. Furthermore, coherency between ACC and AI in the delta (2-4 Hz) range shifted alongside the rats performance state. Overall we show that ACC and AI LFP activity changes correlate to the rats relative performance state in an effort-based task.\n\nSignificance StatementAnimals need to assess whether or not a behavior is worth pursuing based on their internal states (e.g., hunger, fatigue) and the costs and benefits of the behavior. However, internal states often change as behaviors are carried out, such as becoming fatigued, necessitating constant reassessment as to whether to continue the behavior or quit. We characterized brain activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and insula, brain regions involved in cost-benefit decision making and internal state representations, respectively, as rats carried out a challenging physical-effort task. Both brain regions showed significant shifts in activity as the rats approached their quitting point. Our study provides one of the first characterizations of neural activity as an animal decides to quit an effortful task.",

    "abstract": "Both obesity and sarcopenia are frequently associated in ageing, and together may promote the progression of related conditions such as diabetes and frailty. However, little is known about the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning this association. Here we uncover dysregulated systemic alanine metabolism and hyper-expression of the alanine transaminases (ALT) in the liver of obese/diabetic mice and humans. Hepatocyte-selective silencing of both ALT enzymes revealed a clear role in systemic alanine clearance which related to glycemic control. In obese/diabetic mice, not only did silencing both ALT enzymes retard hyperglycemia, but also reversed skeletal muscle atrophy. This was due to a rescue of depressed skeletal muscle protein synthesis, with a liver-skeletal muscle amino acid metabolic crosstalk exemplified by ex vivo experiments. Mechanistically, chronic liver glucocorticoid and glucagon signaling driven liver alanine catabolism promoted hyperglycemia and skeletal muscle wasting. Taken together, here we reveal an endocrine-hepato-muscular metabolic cycle linking hyperglycemia and skeletal muscle atrophy in type 2 diabetes.",

    "abstract": "The head horn of the Asian rhinoceros beetle develops as extensively folded primordia before unfurling into its final 3D shape at the pupal molt. The information of the final 3D structure of the beetle horn is encoded in the folding pattern of the developing primordia. However, the developmental mechanism underlying epithelial folding of the primordia is unknown. In this study, we addressed this gap in our understanding of the developmental patterning of the 3D horn shape of beetles by focusing on the formation of surficial furrows that become the bifurcated 3D shape of the horn. By gene knockdown screening via RNAi, we found that knockdown of the gene Notch disturbed overall horn primordia furrow depth without affecting 2D furrow pattern. In contrast, knockdown of CyclinE altered 2D horn primordia furrow pattern without affecting furrow depth. From these results, depth and 2D pattern of primordial surficial furrow are likely to be regulated independently during the development and both of change can alter the final 3D shape.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn insects, some large structure is made under the old exoskeleton before the molting. Long horn of rhino-beetle is one of extreme cases. The beetle horn is compactly packed as furrowed primordia under the larval exoskeleton. At molting, the primordia is extended to form its final 3D horn shape as blowing up furrows like a balloon. This transformation from primordia to final horn does not required any living cell activities. Thus, characteristics of furrows of primordia actually determine the final 3D shape. However, molecular mechanisms and genetic basis of furrow formation is not well understood not only in beetle horn but also in any other insects. In this study, by using beetle horn as a model, we addressed what kind of genetic factors are contributed to primordial furrow formation. By gene knockdown screening, we found that knockdown of the gene Notch disturbed primordial furrow depth without affecting 2D furrow pattern. In contrast, knockdown of CyclinE altered 2D furrow pattern without affecting furrow depth. In both case, final horn shapes were disturbed. From these results, we concluded that both of the depth and 2D pattern of primordial furrow can contribute final shape, but their development is controlled independently.",

    "abstract": "The set of mutations observed at the outset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may illuminate how the virus will adapt to humans as it continues to spread. Viruses are expected to quickly acquire beneficial mutations upon jumping to a new host species. Advantageous nucleotide substitutions can be identified by their parallel occurrence in multiple independent lineages and are likely to result in changes to protein sequences. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 is acquiring mutations more slowly than expected for neutral evolution, suggesting purifying selection is the dominant mode of evolution during the initial phase of the pandemic. However, several parallel mutations arose in multiple independent lineages and may provide a fitness advantage over the ancestral genome. We propose plausible reasons for several of the most frequent mutations. The absence of mutations in other genome regions suggests essential components of SARS-CoV-2 that could be the target of drug development. Overall this study provides genomic insights into how SARS-CoV-2 has adapted and will continue to adapt to humans.\n\nSUMMARYIn this study we sought signals of evolution to identify how the SARS-CoV-2 genome has adapted at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that the genome is largely undergoing purifying selection that maintains its ancestral sequence. However, we identified multiple positions on the genome that appear to confer an adaptive advantage based on their repeated evolution in independent lineages. This information indicates how SARS-CoV-2 will evolve as it diversifies in an increasing number of hosts.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, the observed antibody sequence space has grown exponentially due to advances in high-throughput sequencing of immune receptors. The rise in sequences has not been mirrored by a rise in structures, as experimental structure determination techniques have remained low-throughput. Computational modeling, however, has the potential to close the sequence-structure gap. To achieve this goal, computational methods must be robust, fast, easy to use, and accurate. Here we report on the latest advances made in RosettaAntibody and Rosetta SnugDock--methods for antibody structure prediction and antibody-antigen docking. We simplified the user interface, expanded and automated the template database, generalized the kinematics of antibody-antigen docking (which enabled modeling of single-domain antibodies) and incorporated new loop modeling techniques. To evaluate the effects of our updates on modeling accuracy, we developed rigorous tests under a new scientific benchmarking framework within Rosetta. Benchmarking revealed that more structurally similar templates could be identified in the updated database and that SnugDock broadened its applicability without losing accuracy. However, there are further advances to be made, including increasing the accuracy and speed of CDR-H3 loop modeling, before computational approaches can accurately model any antibody.",

    "abstract": "The phosphatidylinositol (PI) cycle is central to eukaryotic cell signaling. Its complexity, due to the number of reactions and lipid and inositol phosphate intermediates involved makes it difficult to analyze experimentally. Computational modelling approaches are seen as a way forward to elucidate complex biological regulatory mechanisms when this cannot be achieved solely through experimental approaches. Whilst mathematical modelling is well established in informing biological systems, many models are often informed by data sourced from different cell types (mosaic data), to inform model parameters. For instance, kinetic rate constants are often determined from purified enzyme data in vitro or use experimental concentrations obtained from multiple unrelated cell types. Thus they do not represent any specific cell type nor fully capture cell specific behaviours. In this work, we develop a model of the PI cycle informed by in-vivo omics data taken from a single cell type, namely platelets. Our model recapitulates the known experimental dynamics before and after stimulation with different agonists and demonstrates the importance of lipid- and protein-binding proteins in regulating second messenger outputs. Furthermore, we were able to make a number of predictions regarding the regulation of PI cycle enzymes and the importance of the number of receptors required for successful GPCR signaling. We then consider how pathway behavior differs, when fully informed by data for HeLa cells and show that model predictions remain relatively consistent. However, when informed by mosaic experimental data model predictions greatly vary. Our work illustrates the risks of using mosaic datasets from unrelated cell types which leads to over 75% of outputs not fitting with expected behaviors.\n\nAuthors summaryComputational models of cellular complexity offer much in terms of understanding cell behaviors and in informing experimental design, but their usefulness is limited in them being built with mosaic data not representing specific cell types and tested against limited experimental outputs. In this work we demonstrate an approach using quantitative proteomic datasets and temporal experimental data from a single cell type (platelets) to inform kinetic rate constants and protein concentrations for a mathematical model of a key signaling pathway - the phosphatidylinositol (PI) cycle; known for its central role in numerous cell functions and diseases. After using our model to make novel predictions regarding how aspects of the pathway are regulated, we demonstrate its versatile nature by utilising proteomic data from other cell types to generate similar predictions for those cells while highlighting the pitfalls of using mosaic data when constructing computational models.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystems provide multiple services that are necessary to maintain human life and activities. Agroecosystems are very productive suppliers of biomass-related provisioning ecosystem services, e.g. food, fibre and energy. At the same time, they are highly dependent on respective ecosystem condition and regulating ecosystem services such as soil fertility, water supply or soil erosion regulation. Assessments of this interplay of ecosystem conditions and services are very important to understand the relationships in highly managed systems. Therefore, the aim of this study is twofold: First, to test the concept and indicators proposed by the European Union Working Group on Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) for the assessment of agroecosystem condition at a regional level. Second, to identify the relationships between ecosystem condition and the delivery of ecosystem services. For this purpose, we applied an operational framework for integrated mapping and assessment of ecosystems and their services. We used the proposed indicators to assess the condition of agroecosystems in Northern Germany and the provision of the regulating ecosystem service control of erosion rates. We used existing data that are available from official databases for the calculation of the different indicators. We show maps of environmental pressures, ecosystem condition and ecosystem service indicators for the Federal State of Lower Saxony. Furthermore, we identified areas within the state where pressures are high, conditions are limited, and more sustainable management practices are needed.\n\nDespite the limitations of the indicators and data availability, our results show positive, negative and no significant correlations between the different pressures and condition indicators, and the control of erosion rates. Although the idea behind the MAES framework is to show the general condition of an ecosystem, when looking at the relationships between condition and ecosystem services, we identified that not all the indicators - as they are proposed- are suitable to explain to what extent ecosystems are able to provide certain ecosystem services. Further research on other ecosystem services provided by agroecosystems would facilitate the identification of synergies and trade-offs. Moreover, the definition of a reference condition, although complicated for anthropogenically highly modified agroecosystems, would provide a benchmark to compare information on the condition of the ecosystems, leading to better land use policy and management decisions",

Several studies have shown that feed additives 3-nitroxypropanol and nitrate to be effective in reducing enteric methane emissions. The objective of this study was to estimate the net mitigating effect of using 3-nitroxypropanol and nitrate on total greenhouse gas emissions in California dairy industry. A life cycle assessment approach was used to conduct a cradle-to-farm gate environmental impact analysis based on dairy production system in California. Emissions associated with crop production, feed additive production, enteric methane, farm management, and manure storage were calculated and expressed as kg CO2 equivalents (CO2e) per kg of energy corrected milk. The total greenhouse gas emissions from baseline, two 3-nitroxypropanol and three nitrate scenarios were 1.12, 0.993, 0.991, 1.08, 1.07, and 1.09 kg CO2e/kg energy corrected milk. The average net reduction rates for 3-nitroxypropanol and nitrate were 11.7% and 3.95%, respectively. In both cases, using the feed additives on the whole herd slightly improved overall carbon footprint reduction compared to limiting its use during lactation phase. Although both 3-nitroxypropanol and nitrate had effects on decreasing the total greenhouse gas emission, the former was much more effective with no known safety issues in reducing the carbon footprint of dairy production in California.",

Secondary exclusion of individuals was done under the following conditions: for female sex-hormones, those with contraceptives (8%); for CA19-9, those supposed to have negative Lewis blood-group (10.5%); for insulin, those with BMI[&ge;]28 kg/m2 (29.9%); for the thyroid panel, those with anti-thyroid antibodies (10.3% in males; 24.5% in females). Gender-specific RIs were required for all analytes except CA19-9, CA15-3, thyroid-related tests, parathyroid hormone, and insulin. Age-specific RIs were required for -fetoprotein and all sex-hormones except testosterone. RIs were generally derived by parametric method after Gaussian transformation using modified Box-Cox formula. Exceptions were growth hormone, estradiol, and progesterone, for which nonparametric method was required due to bimodal distribution and/or insufficient detection limit.\n\nConclusionRIs for major hormones and tumor markers specific for the Russian population were derived based on the up-to-date internationally harmonized protocol by careful consideration of analyte-specific SVs.",

    "abstract": "The human body is exceptional for many reasons, not the least of which is the wide variety of movements it is capable of executing. Because our species is able to execute so many discrete activities, researchers often disagree on which were the movements most essential to the evolution of our species. This paper continues a recently introduced analysis, that the performance gap between female and male athletes narrows in sports which most reflect movements humans evolved to do. Here, I examine the performance gap in rock climbing. Because rock climbing is so similar to tree climbing, which bountiful evidence suggests has been key to the origin and proliferation of our species, we would expect to see a narrow performance gap between men and women in the sport. Indeed, this is the case. Female climbers are some of the best in the world irrespective of gender, a trend that is not found in any other major sport. I conclude that exceptional ability of female climbers is further evidence of the existence of sex-blind musculoskeletal adaptations, which developed over the course of human evolution to facilitate essential movements. These adaptations abate the general physical sexual dimorphism which exists in humans. This paper provides more evidence that the performance gap in sport can be used as a measure of human evolution.",

    "abstract": "The adopting healthy life styles are greatly influenced by individual\u2019s perceived risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs). This study aimed to develop and validate a questionnaire that can assess the individual\u2019s perceived risk of developing four major NCDs. Exploratory sequential mixed methods design was used. Qualitative part developed the question items pool by conducting two expert panels while quantitative part validated the questionnaire using both exploratory (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Separate samples were used for EFA (n=150) and CFA (n=210). The participants were aged between 25-60 years of both sexes with no known history of NCDs. Face to face interview was conducted. Parallel analysis was done to decide the number of factors to be extracted. EFA was done using maximum likelihood method with Promax rotation to extract the underlying factors of perceived risk while CFA was done to assess the goodness of fit of proposed EFA Model using model fit indices. Based on literature search, 86-item questionnaire was firstly generated. During two expert panels, some overlapped items and items that did not represent the specific construct were removed. Experts made sure the content validity of developed 51-item questionnaire which was used to collect data from 360 participants. EFA revealed the five factors model with 22 high loading items which extracted 54% of total variance. CFA proved that hypothesized five factors model of 21-item questionnaire (one item was removed due to low loading) was satisfied with adequate psychometric properties and model fit indices (RMSEA=0.056, CFI=0.921, TLI=0.908, SRMR=0.063 &amp; \u03c72/df=1.66). Developed 21-item questionnaire was shown to be valid and reliable to assess the perceived risk of developing NCDs among Myanmar population. Further research should be conducted to assess on the utility of the questionnaire in mismatch between risk perception and current risk and individualized counseling for behaviour change communication.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is endemic in Kenya affecting cloven-hoofed ruminants. The epidemiology of the disease in small ruminants (SR) is not documented. We carried out a cross-sectional study, the first in Kenya, to estimate the sero-prevalence of FMD in SR and the associated risk factors nationally. Selection of animals to be sampled used a multistage cluster sampling approach. Serum samples totaling 7564 were screened for FMD antibodies of Non-Structural-Proteins using ID Screen(R) NSP Competition ELISA kit. Data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Studies Version 20. To identify the risk factors, chi-square and logistic regression analyses were used. The country animal level sero-prevalence was 23.3% (95% CI: 22.3-24.3%) while herd level sero-prevalence was 77.6% (95% CI: 73.9-80.9%). Sero-positivity was significantly higher in the pastoral zone (31.5%) than in the sedentary zone at 14.5% ({chi}2 =303.2, p<0.05). In the most parsimonious backward fitting logistic multivariable regression, the only risk factors that were significantly positively associated with FMD sero-positivity in SR were multipurpose (OR=1.150; p=0.034) and dairy production types (OR=2.029; p=0.003). Those that were significantly negatively associated with FMD sero-positivity were male sex (OR=0.856; p=0.026), young age (OR=0.601; p=0.037), sedentary production zone (OR=0.471; p<0.001), bringing in of SR (OR=0.838; p=0.004), purchase of SR from market/middlemen (OR=0.877; p=0.049), no interaction with wildlife (OR=0.657; p<0.001), mixed production type (OR=0.701; p=0.016), enclosure of SR day and night (OR=0.515; p=0.001), migratory grazing system (OR=0.807; p=0.047), on-farm watering system (OR=0.724; p=0.002), male-from-another-farm (OR=0.723; p=0.030) and artificial insemination (OR=0.357; p=0.008) breeding methods.\n\nThis study showed that there is widespread undetected virus circulation in SR indicated by ubiquitous spatial distribution of significant FMD sero-positivity in the country. The risk factors were mainly husbandry related. Strengthening of risk-based FMD surveillance in carrier SR which pose potential risk of virus transmission to other susceptible species is recommended. Adjustment of husbandry practices to control FMD in SR and in-contact species is suggested. Cross-transmission and more risk factors need to be researched.",

We found that both double mutations decrease protein stability and induce the aggregation of {beta}/{gamma}-crystallin, possibly causing cataracts. This finding suggests that both the double mutants can serve as biomarkers of congenital cataracts.",

Yet there is no effective approved treatment for the disease. In an effort of utilizing human ferritin as nanoplatform for drug delivery, we engineered a fusion protein by presenting receptor-binding motif (RBM) of SARS-CoV-2 virus spike glycoprotein on the N-terminus of ferritin subunits. The designed fusion protein with a cage-like structure, similar to that of corona virus, is a potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. We hereby show the construction, preparation, and characterization of the fusion protein RBM-HFtn. Our initial affinity study confirmed its biological activity towards ACE2 receptor which suggests its mode of action against SARS-CoV-2 could be either through vaccine therapy or blocking the cellular entry of virus as antagonist of ACE2 receptor.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus causing mainly respiratory, but also gastrointestinal symptoms. Elucidating the molecular processes underlying SARS-CoV-2 infection, and how the genetic background of an individual is responsible for the variability in clinical presentation and severity of COVID-19 is essential in understanding this disease.\n\nCell infection by the SARS-CoV-2 virus requires binding of its Spike (S) protein to the ACE2 cell surface protein and priming of the S by the serine protease TMPRSS2. One may expect that genetic variants leading to a defective TMPRSS2 protein can affect SARS-CoV-2 ability to infect cells. We used a range of bioinformatics methods to estimate the prevalence and pathogenicity of TMPRSS2 genetic variants in the human population, and assess whether TMPRSS2 and ACE2 are co-expressed in the intestine, similarly to what is observed in lungs.\n\nWe generated a 3D structural model of the TMPRSS2 extracellular domain using the prediction server Phyre and studied 378 naturally-occurring TMPRSS2 variants reported in the GnomAD database. One common variant, p.V160M (rs12329760), is predicted damaging by both SIFT and PolyPhen2 and has a MAF of 0.25. Valine 160 is a highly conserved residue within the SRCS domain. The SRCS is found in proteins involved in host defence, such as CD5 and CD6, but its role in TMPRSS2 remains unknown. 84 rare variants (53 missense and 31 leading to a prematurely truncated protein, cumulative minor allele frequency (MAF) 7.34x10-4) cause structural destabilization and possibly protein misfolding, and are also predicted damaging by SIFT and PolyPhen2 prediction tools. Moreover, we extracted gene expression data from the human protein atlas and showed that both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed in the small intestine, duodenum and colon, as well as the kidneys and gallbladder.\n\nThe implications of our study are that: i. TMPRSS2 variants, in particular p.V160M with a MAF of 0.25, should be investigated as a possible marker of disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19 and ii. in vitro validation of the co-expression of TMPRSS2 and ACE2 in gastro-intestinal is warranted.",

    "abstract": "Microarray data from SARS CoV2 patients helps to construct a gene network relating to this disease. Analysis of these genes, present in network, highlights their biological functions and related cellular pathways. With the assistance of these information, a drug(s) can be identified to treat COVID-19. A detailed analysis of the human host response to SARS CoV 2 with expression profiling by high throughput sequencing has executed with primary human lung epithelium cell lines. Clustered genes annotation and gene network construction are performed with the help of String database. Among four cluster of genes from microarray data, cluster 1 is identified as basal cells with p= 1.37e-05 with 44 genes. Functional enrichment analysis of genes present in gene network has completed using String database, ToppFun online tool and NetworkAnalyst tool. For SARS CoV2 virus particles, keratin proteins, which are part of cytoskeleton structure of host cell, play a major role in cell to cell virus particle transmission. Among three types of cell- cell communication, only anchoring junction between basal cell membrane and basal lamina, is involved in this virus transmission. In this junction point, hemidesmosome structure play a vital role in virus spread from one cell to basal lamina in respiratory tract. In this protein complex structure, keratin, integrin and laminin proteins of host cell is used to promote the spread of virus infection into extracellular matrix. So, small molecular blockers of different anchoring junction proteins i.e. ITGA3, ITGA2 can provide efficient protection against this deadly virus disease. Understanding the human host response against this virus is very important to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of SARS-CoV 2.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is a new viral emergent human disease caused by a novel strain of Coronavirus. This virus has caused a huge problem in the world as millions of the people are affected with this disease in the entire world. We aimed to design a peptide vaccine for COVID-19 particularly for the envelope protein using computational methods to predict epitopes inducing the immune system and can be used later to create a new peptide vaccine that could replace conventional vaccines. A total of available 370 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 were retrieved from NCBI for bioinformatics analysis using Immune Epitope Data Base (IEDB) to predict B and T cells epitopes. Then we docked the best predicted CTL epitopes with HLA alleles. CTL cell epitopes namely interacted with MHC class I alleles and we suggested them to become universal peptides based vaccine against COVID-19. Potentially continuous B cell epitopes were predicted using tools from IEDB. The Allergenicity of predicted epitopes was analyzed by AllerTOP tool and the coverage was determined throughout the worlds. We found these CTL epitopes to be T helper epitopes also. The B cell epitope, SRVKNL and T cell epitope, FLAFVVFLL were suggested to become a universal candidate for peptide-based vaccine against COVID-19. We hope to confirm our findings by adding complementary steps of both in vitro and in vivo studies to support this new universal predicted candidate.",
