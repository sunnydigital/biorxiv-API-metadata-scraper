    "abstract": "Resting state electroencephalographic (EEG) recording could provide cost-effective means to aid in the detection of neurological disorders such as Parkinsons disease (PD). We examined how many electrodes are needed for classification of PD based on EEG, which electrode locations provide most value for classification, and whether data recorded eyes open or closed yield comparable results. We used a nested cross-validated classifier which included a budget-based search algorithm for selecting the optimal electrodes for classification. By iterating over variable budgets, we show that with eyes open recording, only 10 electrodes, localized over motor and occipital areas enable relatively accurate classification (AUC = .82) between PD patients (N=20) and age-matched healthy control participants (N=20). Classification accuracy only slightly increased when all 64 electrodes were included (AUC = .85). With the data recorded eyes closed, classification was not statistically significantly above chance even with full set of 64 electrodes (AUC = .55). These results show that classification based on small number of EEG electrodes is a promising tool for classifying PD, but measurement conditions and electrode locations can have a significant effect on classifier performance.",

    "abstract": "GS-967 and eleclazine (GS-6615) are novel sodium channel inhibitors exhibiting antiarrhythmic effects in various in vitro and in vivo models. The antiarrhythmic mechanism has been attributed to preferential suppression of late sodium current (INaL). Here, we took advantage of a throughput automated electrophysiology platform (SyncroPatch 768PE) to investigate the molecular pharmacology of GS-967 and eleclazine on peak sodium current (INaP) recorded from human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes. We compared GS-967 and eleclazine to the antiarrhythmic drug lidocaine, the prototype INaL inhibitor ranolazine, and the slow inactivation enhancing drug lacosamide. In human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes, GS-967 and eleclazine caused a reduction of INaP in a frequency-dependent manner consistent with use-dependent block (UDB). GS-967 and eleclazine had similar efficacy but evoked more potent UDB of INaP (IC50=0.07 and 0.6 M, respectively) than ranolazine (7.8 M), lidocaine (133.5 M) and lacosamide (158.5 M). In addition, GS-967 and eleclazine exerted more potent effects on slow inactivation and recovery from inactivation compared to the other sodium channel blocking drugs we tested. The greater UDB potency of GS-967 and eleclazine was attributed to the significantly higher association rates (KON) and moderate unbinding rate (KOFF) of these two compounds with sodium channels. We propose that substantial UDB contributes to the observed antiarrhythmic efficacy of GS-967 and eleclazine.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWe investigated the molecular pharmacology of GS-967 and eleclazine on sodium channels in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes using a high throughput automated electrophysiology platform. Sodium channel inhibition by GS-967 and eleclazine has unique features including accelerating the onset of slow inactivation and impairing recovery from inactivation. These effects combined with rapid binding and moderate unbinding kinetics explain potent use-dependent block, which we propose contributes to their observed antiarrhythmic efficacy.",

However, there is currently no clear pathway for safely testing such tools in endemic countries. The lack of well-characterized promoters for infection-relevant tissues and regulatory hurdles are further obstacles for their design and use. Here we explore how minimal genetic modifications of endogenous mosquito genes can convert them directly into non-autonomous gene drives without disrupting their expression. We co-opted the native regulatory sequences of three midgut-specific loci of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae to host a prototypical antimalarial molecule and guide-RNAs encoded within artificial introns, that support efficient gene drive. We assess the propensity of these modifications to interfere with the development of Plasmodium falciparum and their effect on fitness. Because of their inherent simplicity and passive mode of drive such traits could form part of an accepted testing pathway of gene drives for malaria eradication.",

Whether birds own song is represented and recognized as a special category in adult birds, however, is unclear. If birds respond differently to their own songs when these are played back to them, this would be evidence for auditory self-recognition. To test this possibility, we presented song sparrow males (Melospiza melodia) playbacks of their own songs or stranger songs and measured aggressive responses as well as type matching. We find no evidence of behavioral discrimination of birds own song relative to the (non-matching) stranger song. These findings cast doubt on an earlier proposal that song sparrows display auditory self-recognition and support the common assumption in playback experiments that birds own song is perceived as stranger song.",

The glycocalyx is a layer of proteoglycans, glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans that lines the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium, interacting directly with the components of the blood and the forces of blood flow. In this work, we examined the changes in mechanical tension of syndecan-1, a cell surface proteoglycan that is an integral part of the glycocalyx, in response to substrate stiffness and fluidic shear stress. Our studies demonstrate that syndecan-1 is mechanically responsive to extracellular mechanical cues and alters its association with cytoskeletal and adhesion-related proteins in response to substrate stiffness and physiological flow.",

    "abstract": "Mature microRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNA molecules that function by base-pairing with mRNAs. In multicellular organisms, miRNAs lead to mRNA destabilization and translation arrest. Importantly, the quantities and stichometry of miRNAs/mRNAs determine the miRNA regulation characteristics of specific cells. In this study, we used COMICS (Competition of miRNA Interactions in Cell Systems), a stochastic computational iterative framework to characterize genes by their sensitivity and robustness to miRNA regulation. We monitor the cell state by quantifying the retention level for all mRNAs, at the end of 100,000 simulation iterations. In HeLa cells, we partitioned all genes to five classes according to their decay rates. We show that the largest class (69% of genes) is apparently resistant to miRNA regulation. We created in silico perturbations using overexpressing of all major miRNAs (248 types) at various levels relative to the basal level (x1 to x1000). We further classified genes according to the differential behaviour for any pair of conditions of miRNA expression profile. Based on such measure (OvereXpression Ratio, OXR), we identified a small number of gene sets that are especially sensitive to OXR. Our results expose an overlooked quantitative dimension for set of genes and miRNA regulation in living cells.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient detection of copy number variants (CNVs) is of critical importance due to their significant association with complex genetic diseases. Although algorithms that use whole genome sequencing (WGS) data provide stable results with mostly-valid statistical assumptions, copy number detection on whole exome sequencing (WES) data shows comparatively lower accuracy. This is unfortunate as WES data is cost efficient, compact and is relatively ubiquitous. The bottleneck is primarily due to non-contiguous nature of the targeted capture: biases in targeted genomic hybridization, GC content, targeting probes, and sample batching during sequencing. Here, we present a novel deep learning model, DECoNT, which uses the matched WES and WGS data and learns to correct the copy number variations reported by any off-the-shelf WES-based germline CNV caller. We train DECoNT on the 1000 Genomes Project data, and we show that we can efficiently triple the duplication call precision and double the deletion call precision of the state-of-the-art algorithms. We also show that our model consistently improves the performance independent from (i) sequencing technology, (ii) exome capture kit and (iii) CNV caller. Using DECoNT as a universal exome CNV call polisher has the potential to improve the reliability of germline CNV detection on WES data sets.",

Here, using a combination of a novel human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based cancer model along with zebrafish transgenesis, we demonstrate that the transforming ability of BRAFV600E depends upon the intrinsic transcriptional program present in the cell of origin. Remarkably, in both systems, melanocytes (MC) are largely resistant to BRAF. In contrast, both neural crest (NC) and melanoblast (MB) populations are readily transformed. Molecular profiling reveals that NC/MB cells have markedly higher expression of chromatin modifying enzymes, and we discovered that the chromatin remodeler ATAD2 is required for response to BRAF and tumor initiation. ATAD2 forms a complex with SOX10, allowing for expression of downstream oncogenic programs. These data suggest that oncogenic competence is mediated by developmental regulation of chromatin factors, which then allow for proper response to those oncogenes.",

In the current study we show for the first time that pancreatic tumors produce 2HG in the absence of IDH1/2 mutation. Our study shows that hypoxic pancreatic tumors that have activated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, produce the L-isoform of 2HG.\n\nMetabolic mass spectrometric analysis along with chiral derivatization showed that pancreatic cancer cells as well as stromal cells secrete the L-isomeric form of 2-hydroxyglutarate (L-2HG) when exposed to hypoxic environment. Serum analysis of human pancreatic cancer patients also showed similar accumulation of L-2HG. Our results showed that this abnormally accumulated L-2HG regulates self-renewal by increasing expression of genes associated with stemness (Sox-2, CD133) and by decreasing expression of differentiation genes (Pdx-1, HB9, NKX6.1). Further analysis showed that secreted L-2HG mediates cross talk with immune T-cells and hampers their proliferation and migration thereby suppressing the anti-tumor immunity. In vivo targeting of LDH enzyme with inhibitor (GSK2837808A) showed decrease in L-2HG as well as subsequent tumor regression and sensitization to immune-checkpoint therapy.\n\nPresent study shows for the first time that hypoxia mediated accumulation of L-2HG drives self-renewal in pancreatic cancer by shifting critical balance of gene expression towards stemness and promotes immune suppression by impairing T cell activation in this disease. Additionally, it indicates that targeting LDH can sensitize pancreatic tumors to anti-PD1 therapy by decreasing L-2HG and reverting their immune evasive function.",

Marginal R2, expressing the variance explained by the fixed terms in the regression models, was adopted as a measure of functional accuracy, and used to rank the SDMs accordingly. In this respect, the Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) algorithm (Carlson, 2020) gave the best result, despite the low AUC and TSS. By restricting our analysis to the BART algorithm only, a variety of sets of environmental variables commonly or less used in the construction of SDMs were explored and tested according to their functional accuracy.

    "abstract": "AimInsular woodiness, referring to the evolutionary transition from herbaceousness towards woodiness on islands, has arisen at least 38 times on the Canary Islands. Distribution patterns and physiological experiments have suggested a link between insular woodiness and increased drought stress resistance in current-day species, but we do not know in which palaeoclimatic conditions these insular woody lineages originated. Therefore, we estimated the timing of colonisation events and origin of woodiness of multiple Canary Island lineages and reviewed the palaeoclimate based on literature.\n\nLocationCanary Islands (Spain).\n\nTaxon37 lineages, including 24 insular woody and 13 non-insular woody (i.e. herbaceous, ancestrally woody, and derived woody).\n\nMethodsTo enable a simultaneous dating analysis for all 37 lineages, two chloroplast markers (matK and rbcL) for 135 Canary Island species and 103 closely related continental relatives were sequenced and aligned to an existing matK-rbcL dataset including ca 24,000 species that was calibrated with 42 fossils from outside the Canaries. After constraining the species to the family level, 200 RAxML runs were performed and dated with TreePL.\n\nResultsWoodiness in 80-90% of the insular woody lineages originated within the last 7 Myr, coinciding with the onset of major aridification events nearby the Canaries (start of north African desertification, followed by Messinian salinity crisis); in ca 55-65% of the insular woody lineages studied, woodiness developed within the last 3.2 Myr during which Mediterranean seasonality (yearly summer droughts) became established on the Canaries, followed by dry Pleistocene glacial fluctuations.\n\nMain conclusionsAlthough details of the initial colonisation and settlement of many island plant lineages remain elusive, our results are consistent with palaeodrought as a potential driver for woodiness in most of the insular woody Canary Island lineages studied.",

    "abstract": "Identifying causative genes for a target trait in conifer reproduction is challenging for species lacking whole-genome sequences. In this study, we searched for the male-sterility gene (MS1) in Cryptomeria japonica, aiming to promote marker-assisted selection (MAS) of male-sterile C. japonica to reduce the pollinosis caused by pollen dispersal from artificial C. japonica forests in Japan. We searched for mRNA sequences expressed in male strobili and found the gene CJt020762, coding for a lipid transfer protein containing a 4-bp deletion specific to male-sterile individuals. We also found a 30-bp deletion by sequencing the entire gene of another individual with the ms1. All nine breeding materials with the allele ms1 had either a 4-bp or 30-bp deletion in gene CJt020762, both of which are expected to result in faulty gene transcription and function. Furthermore, the 30-bp deletion was detected from three of five individuals in the Ishinomaki natural forest. From our findings, CJt020762 was considered to be the causative gene of MS1. Thus, by performing MAS using two deletion mutations as a DNA marker, it will be possible to find novel breeding materials of C. japonica with the allele ms1 adapted to the unique environment of each region of the Japanese archipelago.",

    "abstract": "We propose a method for marker-based selection of cultivars of clonally-reproducing plant species which keeps the basic genetic architecture of a top-performing cultivar (usually a partly heterozygous genotype), with some agronomically relevant differences (such as production time, product appearance or quality), providing added value to the product or cultivation process. The method is based on selecting a) two complementary nearly-inbred lines from successive selfing generations (ideally only F2 and F3) of large size, that may generate individuals with most of their genome identical to the original cultivar but being homozygous for either of the two component haplotypes in the rest, and b) individuals with such characteristics already occurring in the F2. Option a) allows for introgressing genes from other individuals in one or both of these nearly-inbred lines.\n\nPeach, a woody-perennial, clonally-reproduced species, was chosen as a model for a proof of concept of the Resynthesis process due to its biological characteristics: self-compatibility, compact and genetically well-known genome, low recombination rates and relatively short intergeneration time (3-4 years). From 416 F2 seedlings from cultivar Sweet Dream (SD), we obtained seven individuals with 76-94% identity with SD, and selected five pairs of complementary lines with average homozygosity of the two parents [&ge;]0.70 such that crossing would produce some individuals highly similar to SD. The application of this scheme to other species with more complex genomes or biological features, including its generalization to F1 hybrids, is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with psychiatric disorders perform differently in school compared to the general population. Genetic factors contribute substantially to such differences. It is however unclear if differential performance is seen across all cognitive domains such as math and language. Here we report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of school grades in 30,982 individuals (18,495 with and 12,487 without one or more of six major psychiatric disorders) and a replication study in 4,547 individuals. GWAS of overall school performance yielded results that were highly similar to the results of a previous GWAS of educational attainment. Analyzing subject specific grades, we observed that math performance was severely affected whereas language performance (Danish and English) was relatively unaffected or enhanced in those with psychiatric disorders compared to controls. We found that the genetic variants associated with poor math performance, but better language performance were also associated with increased risk for multiple psychiatric disorders. The same variants were also associated with creativity, which we show through a polygenic score analysis of 2953 creative professionals and 164,622 controls. The results overall suggest that risk for psychiatric disorders, language ability and creativity might have overlapping genetic roots.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive control enables goal-oriented adaptation to a fast-changing environment and has a slow developmental trajectory that spans into young adulthood. The specifics of this development are still poorly understood, as are the neurodevelopmental mechanisms that drive it. In a cross-sectional sample of participants 8-19 years old (n = 108), we used blind source separation of EEG data recorded in a Flanker task to derive electrophysiological measures of attention and the processing of cognitive conflict, including a frontal negative component corresponding to the N2 and a parietal positive component corresponding to the P3. Additionally, we examined multiple behavioral measures of interference control derived from the Flanker, Stroop, and Anti-saccade tasks. We found a positive association between age and the amplitude of the parietal positive component, while there was no relationship between age and the amplitude of the frontal negative component. A stronger frontal negative amplitude was, however, age-independently related to better performance on both Stroop and Anti-saccade measures of interference control. Finally, we examined post-conflict behavioral adjustment on the Flanker task. A Gratton effect was found with slower reaction times on current congruent and better accuracy on current incongruent trials when preceded by incongruent as opposed to congruent trials. The Gratton effect on accuracy was positively associated with age. Together, the findings suggest a multifaceted developmental pattern in neurocognitive mechanisms for conflict processing across adolescence, with a more protracted development of the parietal positive compared to the frontal negative component.",

This property of bacteria hinders the effective cure during lactation period. Antibiotics used for treatments have a short half-life span at the site of action because of frequent milking, therefore unable to maintain desired drug concentration for effective clearance of bacteria. We demonstrated the potential of ciprofloxacin encapsulated nanocarriers which can improve availability of drugs and could provide effective means of the treatment of mastitis. These drug loaded nanoparticles show low toxicity & slow clearance from the site of action. Antimicrobial studied against clinical strain of E.coli. and Staphylococcus aureus zone of inhibition depend on dose 0.5 mg to 2 mg/ml nanoparticles solution from 11.6 to 14.5 mm and 15 to 18mm.

These tasks could become particularly challenging in the absence of robust pharmacodynamics biomarkers or at very flat dose-response curves. Although much knowledge has been acquired in the past decade, it remains uncertain which factors are relevant and how to select doses more rationally. In this study, we developed a quantitative metric, Therapeutic Exposure Affinity Ratio (TEAR), to retrospectively evaluate up to 60 approved antibodies and their therapeutic doses (TDs), and systematically assessed the factors that are relevant to antibody TDs and dose selection patterns. This metric supported us to analyze many factors that are beyond antibody pharmacokinetics and target binding affinity. Our results challenged the traditional perceptions about the importance of target turnovers and target anatomical locations in the selection of TDs, highlighted the relevance of an overlooked factor, antibody mechanisms of action.

Thyroid hormones (THs) are important regulators of embryogenesis transferred from the mother to the embryo. In an avian model, we manipulated embryo exposure to maternal THs through egg injection and investigated the consequences on postnatal growth and aging. We first report that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number and telomere length significantly decrease from early-life to late adulthood, thus confirming that these two molecular markers are hallmarks of aging in our wild bird model. The experimental elevation of prenatal THs levels had a transient positive effect on postnatal growth. Elevated prenatal THs had no effect on mtDNA copy number but significantly increased telomere length both soon after birth and at the end of the growth period (equivalent to offsetting ca. 4 years of post-growth telomere shortening). These findings suggest that prenatal THs have a key role in setting the  biological age at birth, and thus might influence longevity.",

    "abstract": "Cellulolytic microorganisms, like Trichoderma reesei or Clostridium thermocellum, frequently have non-catalytic carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) associated with secreted or cell surface bound multidomain carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) like cellulases. Mostly type-A family CBMs are known to promote cellulose deconstruction by increasing the substrate-bound concentration of cognate cellulase catalytic domains. However, due to the interfacial nature of cellulose hydrolysis and the structural heterogeneity of cellulose, it has been challenging to fully understand the role of CBMs on cellulase activity using classical protein-ligand binding assays. Here, we report a single-molecule CAZyme assay for an industrially relevant processive cellulase Cel7A (from T. reesei) to reveal how subtle CBM1 binding differences can drastically impact cellulase motility/velocity and commitment to initial processive motion for deconstruction of two well-studied crystalline cellulose allomorphs (namely cellulose I and III). We take a multifaceted approach to characterize the complex binding interactions of all major type-A family representative CBMs including CBM1, using an optical-tweezers based single-molecule CBM-cellulose bond  rupture assay to complement several classical bulk ensemble protein-ligand binding characterization methods. While our work provides a basis for the  cautious use of Langmuir-type adsorption models to characterize classical protein-ligand binding assay data, we highlight the critical limitations of using such overly simplistic models to gain a truly molecular-level understanding of interfacial protein binding interactions at heterogeneous solid-liquid interfaces. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations provided a theoretical basis for the complex binding behavior seen for CBM1 towards two distinct cellulose allomorphs reconciling experimental findings from multiscale analytical methods.\n\nSignificance StatementMultimodal biomolecular binding interactions involving carbohydrate polymers (e.g., cellulose, starch, chitin, glycosaminoglycans) are fundamental molecular processes relevant to the recognition, biosynthesis, and degradation of all major terrestrial and aquatic biomass. Protein-carbohydrate binding interactions are also critical to industrial biotechnology operations such as enzymatically-catalyzed bioconversion of starch and lignocellulose into biochemicals like ethanol. However, despite the ubiquitous importance of such interfacial processes, we have a poor molecular-level understanding of protein-polysaccharide binding interactions. Here, we provide a comprehensive experimental and theoretical analysis of bulk ensemble versus single-molecule binding interactions of enzyme motors and associated non-catalytic binding domains with cellulosic polysaccharides to highlight the critical limitations of applying classical biochemical assay techniques alone to understanding protein adsorption or biological activity at solid-liquid interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Proteolysis is a major post-translational regulator of biology both inside and outside of cells. Broad identification of optimal cleavage sites and natural substrates of proteases is critical for drug discovery and to understand protease biology. Here we present a method that employs two genetically encoded substrate phage display libraries coupled with next generation sequencing (SPD-NGS) that allows up to 10,000-fold deeper sequence coverage of the typical 6 to 8 residue protease cleavage sites compared to state-of-the-art synthetic peptide libraries or proteomics. We applied SPD-NGS to two classes of proteases, the intracellular caspases 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8, and the ectodomains of the membrane sheddases, ADAMs 10 and 17. The first library (Lib 10AA) was used to determine substrate cleavage motifs. Lib 10AA contains a highly diverse randomized 10-mer substrate peptide sequences (109 unique members) that was displayed mono-valently on filamentous phage and bound to magnetic beads via an N-terminal biotin. The protease was allowed to cleave the SPD beads, and the released phage subjected to up to three total rounds of positive selection followed by next generation sequencing (NGS). This allowed us to identify from 104 to 105 unique cleavage sites over a 1000-fold dynamic range of NGS counts (ranging from 3-4000), and produced consensus and optimal cleavage motifs based positional sequencing scoring matrices that closely matched synthetic peptide data. A second SPD-NGS library (Lib hP) was constructed that allowed us to identify candidate human proteome sequences. Lib hP displayed virtually the entire human proteome tiled in contiguous 49AA sequences with 25AA overlaps (nearly 1 million members). After three rounds of positive selection we identified up to 104 natural linear cut sites depending on the protease and captured most of the examples previously identified by proteomics (ranging from 30 to 1500) and predicted 10 to 100-fold more. Structural bioinformatics was used to facilitate the identification of candidate natural protein substrates. SPD-NGS is rapid, reproducible, simple to perform and analyze, inexpensive, renewable, with unprecedented depth of coverage for substrate sequences. SPD-NGS is an important tool for protease biologists interested protease specificity for specific assays and inhibitors and to facilitate identification of natural protein substrates.",

However, the genetic basis of the mammalian DNA replication timing program is poorly understood1-3. To systematically identify genetic regulators of DNA replication timing, we exploited inter-individual variation in 457 human pluripotent stem cell lines from 349 individuals. We show that the human genomes replication program is broadly encoded in DNA and identify 1,617 cis-acting replication timing quantitative trait loci (rtQTLs4) - base-pair-resolution sequence determinants of replication initiation. rtQTLs function individually, or in combinations of proximal and distal regulators, to affect replication timing. Analysis of rtQTL locations reveals a histone code for replication initiation, composed of bivalent histone H3 trimethylation marks on a background of histone hyperacetylation. The H3 trimethylation marks are individually repressive yet synergize to promote early replication. We further identify novel positive and negative regulators of DNA replication timing, the former comprised of pluripotency-related transcription factors while the latter involve boundary elements. Human replication timing is controlled by a multi-layered mechanism that operates on target DNA sequences, is composed of dozens of effectors working combinatorially, and follows principles analogous to transcription regulation: a histone code, activators and repressors, and a promoter-enhancer logic.",

    "abstract": "Neural circuit engagement within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell is implicated in the regulation of both negative and positive affect. Classically, the dynorphin/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) system in the NAc was believed to promote dysphoric behavior, while dopamine was viewed as interacting with reward behavior, and KOR activation was known to inhibit dopamine release. Recently, however, both the KOR and dopamine systems have, separately, been shown to have differential effects across the rostro-caudal axis of the NAc shell on hedonic responses. Whether or not this is due to interactions between KORs and dopamine, and if it extends to other affective behaviors, remains to be determined. In this study, we examined in rats the relationship between the KOR and dopamine systems in both the rostral and caudal NAc shell using ex vivo fast scan cyclic voltammetry and the impact of KOR activation on affective behavior using approach-avoidance assays. We report here that activation of KORs in the caudal NAc shell significantly inhibits dopamine release, stimulates novelty-induced rearing behavior, increases avoidance behavior, and reduces locomotor activity. In contrast, activation of KORs in the rostral NAc shell inhibits dopamine release to a lesser extent and instead increases approach behavior. Taken together, these results indicate that there is heterogeneity across the rostro-caudal axis of the NAc shell in the effects of KOR stimulation on affective behaviors, and they suggest that this might be due to differences in KOR control over dopamine release.",

    "abstract": "IMPORTANCEThe dynamic changes of biomarkers and clinical profiles in sporadic Alzheimers disease (SAD) are poorly understood.\n\nOBJECTIVETo evaluate the impact of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) biomarkers on SAD by measuring the dynamic changes in biomarkers and clinical profiles in the progression of SAD.\n\nDESIGN AND SETTINGThis retrospective and longitudinal study analyzed clinical and biomarker data from 665 participants (mean follow-up 4.90 {+/-} 2.83 years) from a subset of the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants collected from August 2005 to December 2018. By aligning the timing of the changes in the various biomarkers with the stable normal cognition (CN) baseline and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD onset timepoints, we combined data from the stable CN, CN conversion to MCI (CN2MCI), and MCI conversion to AD (MCI2AD) groups to identify the trajectories associated with the progression of AD.\n\nPARTICIPANTSThe participants were 294 CN, 69 CN2MCI, 300 MCI2AD, and 24 who converted from CN to MCI to AD (CN2MCI2AD) (of whom 22 were also included in the CN2MCI).\n\nEXPOSURESAmyloid-{beta} measured by florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid assay of amyloid-{beta} (CSF A{beta}42).\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURESThe measures included the 13-item cognitive subscale of the AD Assessment Scale (ADAS13, as a clinical measure), hippocampal volume, and the fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR).\n\nRESULTSThe CN, CN2MCI, and MCI2AD subgroups median (interquartile range [IQR]) annual changes in ADAS13 were (0.388 [-0.278, 0.818], 1.000 [0.239, 2.330], and 3.388 [1.750, 6.169]). The annual changes in hippocampal volume for each group were (-0.005 %ICV [-0.011, -0.001], -0.006 %ICV [-0.012, -0.002], and -0.014 %ICV [-0.021, -0.009]). The annual changes in FDG PET SUVR for each group were (-0.011 [-0.030, 0.010], -0.027 [-0.056, -0.012], and -0.039 [-0.063, 0.014]). Changes in the amyloid biomarkers were inconsistent with clinical profile changes. The annual changes in CSF A{beta}42 for each group were (-1.500 pg/ml [-6.000, 4.000], -2.200 [-5.667, 4.000], and -2.000 [-7.000, 2.650]) and in A{beta} PET SUVR for each group were (0.004 [-0.002, 0.012], 0.004 [-0.001,0.011], and 0.005 [-0.006, 0.014]). During the stable CN and CN2MCI stages, subjects with elevated and those with normal amyloid showed no significant differences (likelihood ratio test, p < .01) in clinical measures, hippocampal volume, or FDG.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCEHippocampal volume and FDG associated with clinical profiles impairment in the SAD progression. A{beta} alone is not associated with clinical profiles, hippocampal volume, and FDG impairment in the preclinical stage of SAD.\n\nKey PointsQuestion: What is the role of amyloid-{beta} in dynamic changes in biomarkers and clinical profiles in the progression of sporadic Alzheimers disease?\n\nFindings: The changes of the hippocampal volume and FDG that were consistent with the changes of the clinical profiles showed a non-linear change in the initial stage and an accelerated non-linear change during MCI2AD, changes in amyloid biomarkers were inconsistent with the clinical profile. Cognitively normal people with elevated or normal amyloid showed no significant differences in clinical measures, hippocampal volume, or FDG.\n\nMeaning: Amyloid-{beta} alone may not be used as the central index for defining the preclinical stage of SAD.",

    "abstract": "The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing continuously in the industrial era, posing a threat to the ecological balance on Earth. There are two ways to reduce elevated CO2 concentrations ([CO2]high): reducing human emissions or increasing their absorption by oceans and plants. However, in response to [CO2]high, plants diminish gas exchange and CO2 uptake by closing stomata. Surprisingly, we do not know how plants sense CO2 in their environment, and the basic mechanisms of the plant response to [CO2]high are very poorly understood. Here, we show that mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are plant CO2 receptors. We demonstrate that MPK4, a prominent MAPK that is known to be involved in the stomatal response to [CO2]high1-3, is capable of binding CO2 and is directly activated by a very low increase in [CO2] in vivo and in vitro. Unlike MPK4 activation by infections4, stress and hormones within known MAPK signalling cascades, [CO2]high-induced MPK4 activation is independent of the upstream regulators MKK1 and MKK2. Moreover, once activated, MPK4 is prone to inactivation by bicarbonate. The identification of stress-responsive MPK4 as a CO2 receptor sheds new light on the integration of various environmental signals in guard cells, setting up MPK4 as the main hub regulating CO2 availability for photosynthesis. This result could help to find new ways to increase CO2 uptake by plants.",

    "abstract": "Predictive models of signaling pathways have proven to be difficult to develop. Reasons include the uncertainty in the number of species, the complexity in species interactions, and the sparseness and uncertainty in experimental data. Traditional approaches to developing mechanistic models rely on collecting experimental data and fitting a single model to that data. This approach works for simple systems but has proven unreliable for complex systems such as biological signaling networks. For example, uncertainty and sparseness of the data often result in overfitted models that have little predictive value beyond recapitulating the experimental data itself. Thus, there is a need to develop new approaches to create predictive mechanistic models of complex systems. However, to determine the effectiveness of any new algorithm, a baseline model is needed to test its performance. To meet this need, we developed a method for generating artificial synthetic networks that are reasonably realistic and thus can be treated as ground truth models. These synthetic models can then be used to generate synthetic data for developing and testing algorithms designed to recover the underlying network topology and associated parameters. Here, we describe a simple approach for generating synthetic signaling networks that can be used for this purpose.",

In contrast to FASN, mtFAS is poorly characterized, especially in higher eukaryotes, with the major product(s), metabolic roles, and cellular function(s) being essentially unknown. Here we show that hypomorphic mtFAS mutants display a severe loss of electron transport chain (ETC) complexes and exhibit compensatory metabolic activities including reductive carboxylation. This effect on ETC complexes appears to be independent of protein lipoylation, the best characterized function of mtFAS, as mutants lacking lipoylation have an intact ETC. Finally, mtFAS impairment blocks the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts in vitro. Together, these data suggest that ETC activity in mammals is profoundly controlled by mtFAS function, thereby connecting anabolic fatty acid synthesis with the oxidation of carbon fuels.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe advance of metagenomic studies provides the opportunity to identify microbial taxa that are associated to human diseases. Multiple methods exist for the association analysis. However, the results could be inconsistent, presenting challenges in interpreting the host-microbiome interactions. To address this issue, we introduce Meta-Signer, a novel Metagenomic Signature Identifier tool based on rank aggregation of features identified from multiple machine learning models including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, LASSO, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Networks, and our recently developed Convolutional Neural Network framework (PopPhy-CNN). Meta-Signer generates ranked taxa lists by training individual machine learning models over multiple training partitions and aggregates them into a single ranked list by an optimization procedure to represent the most informative and robust microbial features. Meta-Signer can rank taxa using two input forms of the data: the relative abundances of the original taxa and taxa from the populated taxonomic trees generated from the original taxa. The latter form allows the evaluation of the association of microbial features at different taxonomic levels to the disease, which is attributed to our novel model of PopPhy-CNN.\n\nResultsWe evaluate Mega-Signer on five different human gut-microbiome datasets. We demonstrate that the features derived from Meta-Signer were more informative compared to those obtained from other available feature ranking methods. The highly ranked features are strongly supported by published literature.\n\nConclusionMeta-Signer is capable of deriving a robust set of microbial features at multiple taxonomic levels for the prediction of host phenotype. Meta-Signer is user-friendly and customizable, allowing users to explore their datasets quickly and efficiently.",

To resolve this discrepancy, we developed SpaGE, a method that integrates spatial and scRNA-seq datasets to predict whole-transcriptome expressions in their spatial configuration.

Here, I adopt a perspective that aims at combining experimental data and optimization algorithms by framing this modeling research as an inverse problem. To illustrate the method, I collected calcium imaging data from the first two regions of the olfactory processing pathway of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the antennal lobe and the calix of the mushroom bodies.

However, the cellular substrate of this early communication remains largely unknown. Here we combine in vivo and in vitro patch-clamp and extracellular recordings to reveal the contribution of mitral cell (MC) firing to the early patterns of network activity in the neonatal olfactory bulb (OB) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), the gatekeeper of limbic circuits. We show that MCs predominantly fire either in an irregular bursting or non-bursting pattern during discontinuous theta events in OB. However, the temporal spike-theta phase coupling is stronger for bursting MCs when compared to non-bursting cells. In line with the direct OB projections to LEC, both bursting and non-bursting firing augments during coordinated patterns of entorhinal activity, yet to a higher magnitude for bursting MCs. These cells are stronger temporally coupled to the discontinuous theta events in LEC. Thus, bursting MCs might drive the entrainment of OB-LEC network during neonatal development.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LIDuring early postnatal development mitral cells show either irregular bursting or non-bursting firing patterns\nC_LIO_LIBursting mitral cells preferentially fire during theta bursts in the neonatal OB, being locked to the theta phase\nC_LIO_LIBursting mitral cells preferentially fire during theta bursts in the neonatal lateral entorhinal cortex and are temporally related to both respiration rhythm- and theta phase\nC_LIO_LIBursting mitral cells act as cellular substrate of the olfactory drive promoting the oscillatory entrainment of entorhinal networks\nC_LI",

During early oogenesis, the asynchrony of the transition from mitosis to meiosis results in heterogeneity in the female germ cell populations at a certain embryonic stage, which limits the studies of meiosis initiation and progression at a higher resolution level. Here, we investigated the transcriptional profiles of 19363 single germ cells collected from E12.5, E14.5 and E16.5 mouse fetal ovaries. Clustering analysis identified seven groups and defined dozens of corresponding transcription factors, providing a global view of cellular differentiation from primordial germ cells towards meiocytes. Further, we explored the dynamics of gene expression within the developmental trajectory with special focus on the mechanisms underlying meiotic initiation. We found that Dpy30 may be involved in the regulation of meiosis initiation at the epigenetic level. Our data provide key insights into the transcriptome features of peri-meiotic female germ cells, which offers new information not only on meiosis initiation and progression but also on screening pathogenic mutations in meiosis-associated diseases.",

We fate-tracked all known colonies of the pillar coral Dendrogyra cylindrus on the Florida Reef Tract from 2013 - 2020 to assess the population and document the impacts of chronic and acute stressors. Large average colony size, an absence of juveniles, and large geographic distances between genotypes suggest that the Florida D. cylindrus population has been reproductively extinct for decades. During the study period, low-intensity chronic stressors were balanced by regrowth, while back-to-back years of coral bleaching and thermally-exacerbated disease led to declines that the subsequent years of recovery suggest would take 11 uninterrupted years to overcome. The most recent stressor on Floridas D. cylindrus population is \"stony coral tissue loss disease.\" Following the appearance of the disease in Florida in 2015, it resulted in unrecoverable losses to the D. cylindrus population as tissue, colonies, and whole genotypes were driven to extinction. Losses of 91% of coral tissue, 88% of colonies, and 73% of genotypes between 2014 and early 2020 have led to functional extinction of D. cylindrus on the Florida Reef Tract.",

    "abstract": "Preeclampsia, a life-threatening pregnancy complication characterized by hypertension and multiorgan damage, affects 2-5% of pregnancies and causes 76,000 deaths per year. Most preeclampsia associated syndromes immediately dispel after removal of placenta, indicating a casual role of placenta in the pathogenesis. Failed transformation of spiral artery due to insufficient invasion and excessive apoptosis of trophoblast suggested developmental defects in preeclampsia placenta. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms that affected placenta development in preeclampsia remained elusive. Here we show that, in preeclampsia placenta, the epigenetic landscape formed during extraembryonic tissue differentiation was disrupted: dramatic chromatin accessibility shift affected known and novel genes implicated in preeclampsia. DNA methylation defects in preeclampsia affected lineage-defining PcG-controlled loci in trophectoderm. LTR12 retrotransposons associated with VCT/SCT-specific genes were hypermethylated. Meanwhile, hundreds of PcG-regulated EVT-specific gene promoters, which otherwise undergone post-ZGA extraembryonic-tissue-specific de novo methylation, were hypomethylated and hyper-activated. Together, these epigenetic defects resulted in placenta developmental delay in preeclampsia. The defective methylation pattern could be detected in serum cfDNA, and could be used to accurately predict preeclampsia at early pregnancy weeks in independent validation cohorts. Our data suggests that the preeclampsia placenta represents a stalled state of epigenetic reprogramming en route of development from trophectoderm to normal placenta.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory impairments, including deficits in odor detection, discrimination, recognition, and changes in odor hedonics are reported in the early stages of Alzheimers disease (AD). Rodent models of AD display deficits in odor learning, detection, and discrimination - recapitulating the clinical condition. However, the impact of familial AD genetic mutations on odor hedonics is unknown. We tested 2-, 4-, and 6-months old 5XFAD (Tg6799) mice in the five-port odor multiple-choice task designed to assay a variety of odor-guided behaviors, including odor preferences/hedonics. We found that 5XFAD mice investigated odors longer than controls, an effect that was driven by 6-months old mice. Interestingly, this effect was carried by females in the 5XFAD group, who investigated odors longer than age-matched males. Upon examining behavior directed towards individual odors to test for aberrant odor preferences, we uncovered that 5XFAD females at several ages displayed heightened preferences towards some of the odors, indicating aberrant hedonics. We observed no impairments in the ability to engage in the task in 5XFAD mice. Taken together, 5XFAD mice, particularly 5XFAD females, displayed prolonged odor investigation behavior and enhanced preferences to certain odors. The data provide insight into hedonic alterations which may occur in AD mouse models, and how these are influenced by biological sex.",

    "abstract": "The McGurk effect is widely used as a measure of multisensory integration during speech perception. Two observations have raised questions about the relationship between the effect and everyday speech perception. First, there is high variability in the strength of the McGurk effect across different stimuli and observers. Second, there is low correlation across observers between perception of the McGurk effect and measures of everyday speech perception, such as the ability to understand noisy audiovisual speech. Using the framework of the causal inference of multisensory speech (CIMS) model, we explored the relationship between the McGurk effect, syllable perception, and sentence perception in seven experiments with a total of 296 different participants. Perceptual reports revealed a relationship between the efficacy of different McGurk stimuli created from the same talker and perception of the auditory component of the McGurk stimuli presented in isolation, either with or without added noise. The CIMS model explained this high stimulus-level correlation using the principles of noisy sensory encoding followed by optimal cue combination within a representational space that was identical for McGurk and everyday speech. In other experiments, CIMS successfully modeled low observer-level correlation between McGurk and everyday speech. Variability in noisy speech perception was modeled using individual differences in noisy sensory encoding, while variability in McGurk perception involved additional differences in causal inference. Participants with all combinations of high and low sensory encoding noise and high and low causal inference disparity thresholds were identified. Perception of the McGurk effect and everyday speech can be explained by a common theoretical framework that includes causal inference.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) brains are characterized by increased levels of the pathogenic amyloid beta (A{beta}) peptide, which accumulates into extracellular plaques. Finding a way to lower A{beta} levels is fundamental for the prevention and treatment of AD. Neprilysin is the major A{beta} degrading enzyme which is regulated by the neuropeptide somatostatin. Here we used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to identify the subtype specificity of the five somatostatin receptors (SSTs) expressed in the brain, involved in the regulation of neprilysin. Using a battery of Sst double knockout (dKO) mice we show that neprilysin is regulated by SST1 and SST4 in a redundant manner. Sst1 and Sst4 dKO mice exhibit a specific decrease of presynaptic neprilysin in the Lacunosum molecular layer. Moreover, a genetic deficiency of Sst1 and Sst4 in amyloid beta precursor protein (App) knock-in mice, an AD mouse model, aggravates the A{beta} pathology in the hippocampus. As a first proof of concept towards an A{beta}-lowering strategy involving neprilysin, we demonstrate that treatment with an agonist selective for SST1 and SST4 ameliorates the A{beta} pathology and improves cognition in the App knock-in AD mouse model.",

Multiple models have been proposed to explain this brain-behavior relationship, predicting alterations in functional and/or effective connectivity (Synchrony and Predictive Coding models), in the latency of neural responses (Facilitation model), and in the relative similarity of neural representations (Sharpening model). Here, we test these predictions with fMRI during overt and covert naming of repeated and novel objects. While we find partial support for predictions of the Facilitation and Sharpening models in the left fusiform gyrus and left frontal cortex, the strongest support was observed for the Synchrony model, with increased coupling between right temporoparietal and anterior cingulate cortex for repeated objects that correlated with priming magnitude across participants.

    "abstract": "Severe emerging and re-emerging viral infections such as Lassa fever, Avian influenza (AI), and COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 urgently call for new strategies for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals targeting conserved components in the virus life cycle. Viral lipids are essential components, and viral-cell membrane fusion is the required entry step for most unrelated enveloped viruses. In this paper, we identified a porphyrin derivative of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) that showed broad antiviral activities in vitro against a panel of enveloped pathogenic viruses including Lassa virus (LASV), Machupo virus (MACV), and SARS-CoV-2 as well as various subtypes of influenza A viral strains with IC50 values ranging from 0.91{+/-}0.25 M to 1.88{+/-}0.34 M. A mechanistic study using influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) as a testing strain showed that PPIX inhibits the infection in the early stage of virus entry through biophysically interacting with the hydrophobic lipids of enveloped virions, thereby inhibiting the formation of the negative curvature required for fusion and blocking the entry of enveloped viruses into host cells. In addition, the preliminary antiviral activities of PPIX were further assessed by testing mice infected with the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1) virus. The results showed that compared with the control group without drug treatment, the survival rate and mean survival time of the mice treated with PPIX were apparently prolonged. These data encourage us to conduct further investigations using PPIX as a lead compound for the rational design of lipid-targeting antivirals for the treatment of infection with enveloped viruses.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReal-life decisions are often complex because they involve making sequential choices that constrain future options. We have previously shown that to render such multi-step decisions manageable, people \"prune\" (i.e. selectively disregard) branches of decision trees that contain negative outcomes. We have theorized that sub-optimal pruning contributes to depression by promoting an oversampling of branches that result in unsavoury outcomes, which results in a negatively-biased valuation of the world. However, no study has tested this theory in depressed individuals.\n\nMethodsThirty unmedicated depressed and 31 healthy participants were administered a sequential reinforcement-based decision-making task to determine pruning behaviours, and completed measures of depression and anxiety. Computational, Bayesian and frequentist analyses examined group differences in task performance and relationships between pruning and depressive symptoms.\n\nResultsConsistent with prior findings, participants robustly pruned branches of decision trees that began with large losses, regardless of the potential utility of those branches. However, there was no group difference in pruning behaviours. Further, there was no relationship between pruning and levels of depression/anxiety.\n\nLimitationsThe relatively small sample size limited the examination of individual differences. The use of other heuristics that are used to render complex decisions feasible, such as memoization and fragmentation, were not examined.\n\nConclusionsWe found no evidence that sub-optimal pruning is evident in depression. Future research could determine whether maladaptive pruning behaviours are observable in specific sub-groups of depressed patients (e.g. in treatment-resistant individuals), or whether misuse of other heuristics may contribute to depression.",

    "abstract": "Mapping animal performance in a behavioural task to underlying cognitive mechanisms and strategies is rarely straightforward, since a task may be solvable in more than one manner. Here, we show that bumblebees perform well on a concept-based visual discrimination task, but spontaneously switch from a concept-based solution to a simpler heuristic with extended training, all while continually increasing performance. Bumblebees were trained in an arena to find reward on displays with shapes of different sizes where they could not use low-level visual cues. One group of bees was rewarded at displays with bigger shapes and another group at displays with smaller shapes. Analysis of total choices shows bees increased their performance over 30 bouts to above chance. However, analyses of first and sequential choices suggest that after approximately 20 bouts, bumblebees changed to a win-stay/lose-switch strategy. Comparing bees behaviour to a probabilistic model based on a win-stay/lose-switch strategy further supports the idea that bees changed strategies with extensive training. Analyses of unrewarded tests indicate bumblebees learned and retained the concept of relative size even after they had already switched to a win-stay, lost-shift strategy. We propose that the reason for this strategy switching may be due to cognitive flexibility and efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is causing an unprecedented global pandemic demanding the urgent development of therapeutic strategies. Microarray binding experiments using an extensive heparan sulfate (HS) oligosaccharide library showed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike of SARS-CoV-2 can bind HS in a length-and sequence-dependent manner. Hexa- and octa-saccharides composed of IdoA2S-GlcNS6S repeating units were identified as optimal ligands. Surface plasma resonance (SPR) showed the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binds with much higher affinity to heparin (KD = 55 nM) compared to the RBD (KD = 1 M) alone. We also found that heparin does not interfere in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding or proteolytic processing of the spike. Our data supports a model in which HS functions as the point of initial attachment for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Tissue staining studies using biologically relevant tissues indicate that heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) is a critical attachment factor for the virus. Collectively, our results highlight the potential of using HS oligosaccharides as a therapeutic agent by inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 binding to target cells.",

However, quantity and diversity of biomedical data, and the spread of clinically relevant knowledge across myriad biomedical databases and publications makes this exceptionally difficult. To address this, we developed the Clinical Knowledge Graph (CKG), an open source platform currently comprised of more than 16 million nodes and 220 million relationships to represent relevant experimental data, public databases and the literature. The CKG also incorporates the latest statistical and machine learning algorithms, drastically accelerating analysis and interpretation of typical proteomics workflows.

Here, we studied fungal community structure using DNA metabarcoding in reforested sites following agricultural abandonment and overgrazing. Two treatments, namely  reforestation using different numbers of tree species and  deer exclusion, have been applied for multiple decades in the study sites. We found that local fungal richness (alpha diversity) and total fungal richness (gamma diversity) were 1.9-2.9 and 1.3-1.9 times greater, respectively, in reforested stands than in natural forests. These results were regardless of the number of tree species planted in the reforested stands. Conversely, reforested stands had a spatially homogenized community structure with relatively lower degrees of compositional dissimilarity among sites within each stand (beta diversity). These findings were attributable to lower environmental heterogeneity, stronger dispersal limitation, and a comparatively shorter time since the onset of community assembly in reforested stands. Deer exclosures had no detectable effect on fungal community structure. Overall, the agricultural legacy in fungal community structure appears to have persisted for decades, even under proactive restoration of aboveground vegetation. Direct human intervention belowground may therefore be necessary for the recovery of soil biota once altered.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection maintains colourful signals that increase sexual attractiveness and dominance. Some sexually selected, colourful signals are pigments synthesized from ingested amino acids. The underlying metabolic pathways for these pigments often release toxic byproducts that can reduce individual survival. However, rather than discarding these otherwise harmful byproducts, animals may use them by integrating them into sexually selected traits. We tested this idea using males of the damselfly Hetaerina americana, which bear a red-pigmented wing spot that is sexually selected through male-male competition for mating territories. First, by using chromatography and confocal microscopy, we determined that the red wing spots are generated by ommochrome pigments derived from tryptophan metabolism. Second, we injected a group of males with the toxic precursor of these ommochromes, 3-hydroxy-kynurenine (3-Hk), confirming the toxicity of this compound in adult males. Finally, by using spectrophotometry and confocal microscopy, we showed that adult males injected with a LC50 of 3-Hk had more ommochromes in their wing spots than controls but similar survival, suggesting that the deposition of ommochrome pigment in the wing detoxifies the tryptophan metabolism process. Thus, we report for the first time that sexually selected pigmented signals involve the biochemical treatment of excreted compounds that could otherwise have lethal effects, a hypothesis we call \"detoxifying ability signalling\". Our results provide new insights about the origin and maintenance of sexual signals, elucidating a mechanism for the evolution of honest indicators of quality that could have arisen due to natural selection.",

The preclinical development of a LIGHT-based therapeutic has been hindered by the lack of functional stability exhibited by this protein.\n\nMethodsHere, we describe the cloning, expression and characterization of five antibody-LIGHT fusion proteins, directed against the alternatively-spliced EDA domain of fibronectin, a conserved tumor-associated antigen.\n\nResultsAmong the five tested formats, only the sequential fusion of the F8 antibody in single-chain diabody format, followed by the LIGHT homotrimer expressed as a single polypeptide, yielded a protein (termed \"F8-LIGHT\") which was not prone to aggregation. A quantitative biodistribution analysis in tumor bearing mice, using radioiodinated protein preparations, confirmed that F8-LIGHT was able to preferentially accumulate at the tumor site, with a tumor-to-blood ratio of ca. five to one twenty-four hours after intravenous administration. Tumor therapy experiments, performed in two murine tumor models (CT26 and WEHI-164), featuring different levels of lymphocyte infiltration into the neoplastic mass, revealed that F8-LiGHT could significantly reduce tumor cell growth and was more potent than a similar fusion protein (KSF-LIGHT), directed against hen egg lysozyme and serving as negative control of irrelevant specificity in the mouse.

    "abstract": "The shapes of grapevine leaves have been critical to correctly identify economically important varieties throughout history. The correspondence of homologous features in nearly all grapevine species and varieties has enabled advanced morphometric approaches to mathematically classify leaf shape. These approaches either model leaves through the measurement of numerous vein lengths and angles or measure a finite number of corresponding landmarks and use Procrustean approaches to superimpose points and perform statistical analyses. Hand illustrations, too, play an important role in grapevine identification, as details omitted using the above methods can be visualized. Here, I use a saturating number of pseudo-landmarks to capture intricate, local features in grapevine leaves: the curvature of veins and the shapes of serrations. Using these points, averaged leaf shapes for 60 varieties of wine and table grapes are calculated that preserve features. A pairwise Procrustes distance matrix of the overall morphological similarity of each variety to the other classifies leaves into two main groups--deeply lobed and more entire--that correspond to the measurements of sinus depth by Pierre Galet. Using the system of Galet, pseudo-landmarks are converted into relative distance and angle measurements. Both Galet-inspired and Procrustean methods allow increased accuracy in predicting variety compared to a finite number of landmarks. Using Procrustean pseudo-landmarks captures grapevine leaf shape at the same level of detail as drawings and provides a quantitative method to arrive at mean leaf shapes representing varieties that can be used within a predictive statistical framework.",

    "abstract": "Over past couple of decades our understanding of visual working memory (VWM), and working memory in general, has been predominantly in line with the capacity debate. We recently opened a new line of inquiry regarding the recall of a single object to go beyond the capacity debate, and showed that a series of feature probe questions about a single object yields poorer recall later in the sequence (Sengupta et al, 2020). In the current work we focused on another aspect of sequential feature recall - mainly regarding whether recall can be improved by asking the same question twice. To that end, we chose to focus on two features - color and location, and we contrasted repeat and non-repeat (from the standpoint of feature questions) trials in a series of two experiments. In repeat trials either color or location would be probed twice consecutively. In non-repeat trials color and location probes were presented one after the other in random order. In all trials the stimulus was a small colored oriented line presented for 1 sec in a location within 4o of visual angle. The recall of color and location were mapped onto continuous variable like Sengupta et al, 2020 - for instance, color recall was mapped onto a color wheel. In the first experiment, we used an unaltered color wheel when the color question was repeated. For the second experiment, we used a rotated color wheels for two consecutive color recall trials. We observed an increase in recall error for both repeat and non-repeat condition for location when the probe was at the second question in both experiments. However, color recall error did not increase for second repeat question condition in Experiment 1 as opposed to the non-repeat condition. On the other hand, in Experiment 2 we observed the expected increase in recall error for both repeat and non repeat condition for color probe at the second question. This maybe due to the fact that participants used an  anchoring strategy in Experiment 1 by remembering where they clicked on the color wheel in the first question. The rotation of color wheel in second experiment destroys the anchor leading to the aforementioned result. The results show that trying to recall the same feature again leads to degradation of recall accuracy for both color and location, and human beings may use different strategies for recall in working memory tasks.",

    "abstract": "Delivery of therapeutics protein to the lung offers effective treatments of lungs disease. Efficacy of delivered therapeutics molecules depends on integrity and stability of protein during nebulization. In this study, we compared three nebulizers: compressed air nebulizer (CAN), ultrasonic nebulizer (USN) and mesh nebulizer (MAN) to deliver aerosol dose, stability and functional activity of a model protein lysozyme. Lysozyme/BSA delivered dose assessed by indirect and direct method. It was shown CAN deliver 0.142{+/-}0.027 to 0.632{+/-} 0.09 ml of protein, USN deliver 0.511{+/-}0.119 to 1.688{+/-}0.173 ml and MAN deliver 0.238{+/-}0.006 to 0.731{+/-}0.013 ml of protein in the same time. Integrity of nebulized proteins were assessed by gel electrophoresis and circular diochorism. It was found integrity of lysozyme compromised in all three nebulizer maximum in CAN and minimum with MAN. The functional activity of protein was assessed after nebulization by turbidometry assay. The functional activity was compromised by all three nebulizer upto some extent. In conclusion, nebulization compromise protein stability: this impact depend on nebulization techniques as well as nature of protein. The CAN deliver protein more precisely in small amount in comparison to the other nebulizer.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=122 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/085720v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5b230forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15ac79corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7130forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@94684e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Light is the primary input of energy into the sunlit ocean, driving daily oscillations in metabolism of primary producers. The consequences of this solar forcing have implications for the whole microbial community, yet in situ measurements of metabolites, direct products of cellular activity, over the diel cycle are scarce. We evaluated community-level biochemical consequences of diel oscillations in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre by quantifying 79 metabolites in particulate organic matter in surface waters every four hours over eight days. Total particulate metabolite concentration peaked at dusk, even when normalized to biomass estimates. The concentrations of 70% of individual metabolites exhibited 24-hour periodicity. Despite the diverse organisms that use them, primary metabolites involved in anabolic processes and redox maintenance had significant 24-hour periodicity. Osmolytes exhibited the largest diel oscillations, implying rapid turnover and metabolic roles beyond cell turgor maintenance. Metatranscriptome analysis revealed the taxa involved in production and consumption of some metabolites, including the osmolyte trehalose. This compound displayed the largest diel oscillations in abundance and was likely produced by the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Crocosphaera for energy storage. These findings demonstrate that paired measurements of particulate metabolites and transcripts resolve strategies microbes use to manage daily energy and redox oscillations.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of human genetic variation in coding regions is fundamental to our understanding of protein function, structure, and evolution. Amino-acid (AA) substitution matrices such as BLOSUM (BLOcks SUbstitution Matrix) and PAM (Point Accepted Mutations) encapsulate the stochastic nature of such proteomic variation and are used in studying protein families and evolutionary processes. However, these matrices were constructed from protein sequences spanning long evolutionary distances and are not designed to reflect polymorphism within species. To accurately represent proteomic variation within the human population, we constructed a set of human-centric substitution matrices derived from genetic variations by analyzing the frequencies of >4.8M single nucleotide variants (SNVs). These human-specific matrices expose short-term evolutionary trends at both codon and AA resolution and therefore present an evolutionary perspective that differs from that implicated in the traditional matrices. Specifically, our matrices consider the directionality of variants, and uncover a set of AA pairs that exhibit a strong tendency to substitute in a specific direction. We further demonstrate that the substitution rates of nucleotides only partially determine AA substitution rates. Finally, we investigate AA substitutions in post-translational modification (PTM) and ion-binding sites. We confirm a strong propensity towards conservation of the identity of the AA that participates in such functions. The empirically-derived human-specific substitution matrices expose purifying selection over a range of residue-based protein properties. The new substitution matrices provide a robust baseline for the analysis of protein variations in health and disease. The underlying methodology is available as an open-access to the biomedical community.",

We have used yeast DNA polymerases {eta}, {zeta}, and Rev1 to study translesion synthesis (TLS) past a nitrogen mustard-based ICL with an 8-atom linker between the crosslinked bases. The Rev1-Pol {zeta} complex was most efficient in complete bypass synthesis, by 2-3 fold, compared to Pol {zeta} alone or Pol {eta}. Rev1 protein, but not its catalytic activity, was required for efficient TLS. A dCMP residue was faithfully inserted across the ICL-G by Pol {eta}, Pol {zeta}, and Rev1-Pol {zeta}. Rev1-Pol {zeta}, and particularly Pol {zeta} alone showed a tendency to stall before the ICL, whereas Pol {eta} stalled just after insertion across the ICL. The stalling of Pol {eta} directly past the ICL is attributed to its autoinhibitory activity, caused by elongation of the short ICL-unhooked oligonucleotide (a six-mer in our study) by Pol {eta} providing a barrier to further elongation of the correct primer. No stalling by Rev1-Pol {zeta} directly past the ICL was observed, suggesting that the proposed function of Pol {zeta} as an extender DNA polymerase is also required for ICL repair.",

The structure of WOX Homeodomain (HD) and the molecular mechanism of its interaction with DNA are unknown. Here, we report the 2.1 [A] crystal structure of the STENOFOLIA (STF) HD from Medicago truncatula in complex with DNA. STF binds DNA as a novel cooperative tetramer, enclosing nearly entire bound DNA surface. The STF tetramer is partially stabilized by docking of the C-terminal tail from one protomer onto a conserved hydrophobic surface on the head of another in a head-to-tail manner. Helix 3 not only serves a canonical role as a base reader in the major groove, but also provides extensive binding to DNA in the minor groove. Our structural and functional data reveal that STF specifically targets  TGA sequence and the cooperative tetrameric binding with DNA is key to transcriptional repression in plants. Our data reveal an unprecedented HD:DNA recognition mechanism, representing the first plant HD structure from WOX family of transcription factors.",

The mechanisms the development of aberrant inflammatory response remains to be elucidated. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that could prevent the expression of inflammatory molecules. Although the microRNA-21 (miR-21) is abundantly expressed in macrophages, the role of miR-21 in sepsis is controversial. Here we showed that miR-21 is upregulated in neutrophils and macrophages from septic mice. We found that myeloid-specific miR-21 deletion enhances animal survival, followed by decreased bacterial growth and organ damage during sepsis. Increased resistance against sepsis was associated with a reduction of aerobic glycolysis (as determined by reduced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and expression of glycolytic enzymes) and systemic inflammatory response (IL-1{beta}TNF and IL-6). While miR-21-/- macrophages failed to induce aerobic glycolysis and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, we observed increased levels of the anti-inflammatory mediators prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and IL10. Using blocking antibodies and pharmacological tools, we further discovered that increased survival and decreased systemic inflammation in miR21{Delta}myel during sepsis is dependent on the PGE2/IL10-mediated glycolysis inhibition. Together, we are showing a heretofore unknown role of macrophage miR21 in the orchestrating the balance between anti-inflammatory mediators and metabolic reprogramming that drives cytokine storm and tissue damage during sepsis.",

The disease is notably severe in elderly and those with underlying chronic conditions. A molecular mechanism that explains why the elderly are vulnerable and why children are resistant is largely unknown. Here we show loading cells with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) enhances the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and the infectivity of the virion. Super resolution imaging of the SARS-CoV-2 entry point with high cholesterol shows almost twice the total number of endocytic entry points. Cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE2) to the endocytic entry site where SARS-CoV-2 presumably docks to efficiently exploit entry into the cell. Furthermore, in cells producing virus, cholesterol optimally positions furin for priming SARS-CoV-2, producing a more infectious virion with improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. In vivo, age and high fat diet induces cholesterol loading by up to 40% and trafficking of ACE2 to endocytic entry sites in lung tissue from mice. We propose a component of COVID19 severity based on tissue cholesterol level and the sensitivity of ACE2 and furin to cholesterol. Molecules that reduce cholesterol or disrupt ACE2 localization with viral entry points or furin localization in the producer cells, may reduce the severity of COVID19 in obese patients.",

Here we show loading cells with cholesterol from blood serum using the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E (apoE) enhances the entry of pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 and the infectivity of the virion. Super resolution imaging of the SARS-CoV-2 entry point with high cholesterol shows almost twice the total number of endocytic entry points. Cholesterol concomitantly traffics angiotensinogen converting enzyme (ACE2) to the endocytic entry site where SARS-CoV-2 presumably docks to efficiently exploit entry into the cell. Furthermore, in cells producing virus, cholesterol optimally positions furin for priming SARS-CoV-2, producing a more infectious virion with improved binding to the ACE2 receptor. In vivo, age and high fat diet induces cholesterol loading by up to 40% and trafficking of ACE2 to endocytic entry sites in lung tissue from mice. We propose a component of COVID19 severity based on tissue cholesterol level and the sensitivity of ACE2 and furin to cholesterol. Molecules that reduce cholesterol or disrupt ACE2 localization with viral entry points or furin localization in the producer cells, may reduce the severity of COVID19 in obese patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAfter its emergence in China in December 2019, the new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2, has rapidly spread infecting more than 3 million people worldwide. South America is among the last regions hit by COVID-19 pandemic. In Uruguay, first cases were detected on March 13 th 2020 presumably imported by travelers returning from Europe.\n\nMethodsWe performed whole-genome sequencing of 10 SARS-CoV-2 from patients diagnosed during the first week (March 16th to 19th) of COVID-19 outbreak in Uruguay. Then, we applied genomic epidemiology using a global dataset to reconstruct the local spatio-temporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nResultsOur phylogeographic analysis showed three independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 from different continents. Also, we evidenced regional circulation of viral strains originally detected in Spain. Introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay could date back as early as Feb 20th. Identification of specific mutations showed rapid local genetic differentiation.\n\nConclusionsWe evidenced early independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 that likely occurred before first cases were detected. Our analysis set the bases for future genomic epidemiology studies to understand the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Uruguay and the Latin America and the Caribbean region.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSARS-CoV-2 is a viral pathogen causing life-threatening disease in human. Interaction between spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 receptor on the cells is a potential factor in the infectivity of a host. The interaction of SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain with its receptor - ACE2, in different hosts was evaluated to understand and predict viral entry. The protein and nucleotide sequences of ACE2 were initially compared across different species to identify key differences among them. The ACE2 receptor of various species was homology modeled (6LZG, 6M0J, and 6VW1 as a reference), and its binding ability to the spike ACE2 binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed. Initially, the spike binding parameters of ACE2 of known infected and uninfected species were compared with each Order (of animals) as a group. Finally, a logistic regression model vis-a-vis the spike binding parameters of ACE2 (considering data against 6LZG and 6M0J) was constructed to predict the probability of viral entry in different hosts.\n\nResultsPhylogeny and alignment comparison did not lead to any meaningful conclusion on viral entry in different hosts. Out of several spike binding parameters of ACE2, a significant difference between the known infected and uninfected species was observed for six parameters. However, these parameters did not specifically categorize the Orders (of animals) into infected or uninfected. The logistic regression model constructed revealed that in the mammalian class, most of the species of Carnivores, Artiodactyls, Perissodactyls, Pholidota, and Primates had high probability of viral entry. However, among the primates, African Elephant had low probability of viral entry. Among rodents, hamsters were highly probable for viral entry with rats and mice having a medium to low probability. Rabbits have a high probability of viral entry. In Birds, ducks have a very low probability, while chickens seemed to have medium probability and turkey showed the highest probability of viral entry.\n\nConclusionsMost of the species considered in this study showed high probability of viral entry. This study would prompt us to closely follow certain species of animals for determining pathogenic insult by SARS-CoV-2 and for determining their ability to act as a carrier and/or disseminator.",

    "abstract": "As the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues, serological assays are urgently needed for rapid diagnosis, contact tracing and for epidemiological studies. So far, there is little data on how commercially available tests perform with real patient samples and if detected IgG antibodies provide protective immunity. Focusing on IgG antibodies, we demonstrate the performance of two ELISA assays (Euroimmun SARS-CoV-2 IgG & Vircell COVID-19 ELISA IgG) in comparison to one lateral flow assay ((LFA) FaStep COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Device) and two in-house developed assays (immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)). We tested follow up serum/plasma samples of individuals PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. Most of the SARS-CoV-2 samples were from individuals with moderate to severe clinical course, who required an in-patient hospital stay.\n\nFor all examined assays, the sensitivity ranged from 58.8 to 76.5% for the early phase of infection (days 5-9) and from 93.8 to 100% for the later period (days 10-18) after PCR-diagnosed with COVID-19. With exception of one sample, all positive tested samples in the analysed cohort, using the commercially available assays examined (including the in-house developed IFA), demonstrated neutralizing (protective) properties in the PRNT, indicating a potential protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Regarding specificity, there was evidence that samples of endemic coronavirus (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E) and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infected individuals cross-reacted in the ELISA assays and IFA, in one case generating a false positive result (may giving a false sense of security). This need to be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Evidence suggests that the brain preferentially consolidates memories during \"offline\" periods, in which an individual is not performing a task and their attention is otherwise undirected, including spans of quiet, resting wakefulness. Moreover, research has demonstrated that factors such as the initial encoding strength of information influence which memories receive the greatest benefit. Recent studies have begun to investigate these periods of post-learning quiet rest using EEG microstate analysis to observe the electrical dynamics of the brain during these stretches of memory consolidation, specifically finding an increase in the amount of the canonical microstate D during a post-encoding rest period. Here, we implement an exploratory analysis to probe the activity of EEG microstates during a post-encoding session of quiet rest in order to scrutinize the impact of learning on microstate dynamics and to further understand the role these microstates play in the consolidation of memories. We examined 54 subjects (41 female) as they completed a word-pair memory task designed to use repetition to vary the initial encoding strength of the word-pair memories. In this study, we were able to replicate previous research in which there was a significant increase (p < .05) in the amount of microstate D (often associated with the dorsal attention network) during post-encoding rest. This change was accompanied by a significant decrease (p < .05) in the amount of microstate C (often associated with the default mode network). We also found preliminary evidence indicating a positive relationship between the amount of microstate D and improved memory for weakly encoded memories, which merits further exploration.",

Here we describe the Brain Modeling ToolKit (BMTK), a software suite for building models and performing simulations at multiple levels of resolution, from biophysically detailed multi-compartmental, to point-neuron, to population-statistical approaches. Leveraging the SONATA file format and existing software such as NEURON, NEST, and others, BMTK offers consistent user experience across multiple levels of resolution. It permits highly sophisticated simulations to be set up with little coding required, thus lowering entry barriers to new users. We illustrate successful applications of BMTK to large-scale simulations of a cortical area. BMTK is an open-source package provided as a resource supporting modeling-based discovery in the community.",

    "abstract": "Pyramidal neurons in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a prefrontal region involved in processing the affective components of pain, display hyperexcitability in chronic neuropathic conditions and their silencing abolishes hyperalgesia in rodents. We show here that dopamine, through D1-like receptor signaling, inhibits layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons of mouse ACC. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels control the firing activity of these pyramidal neurons. Through Gs-coupled D1-like receptors, dopamine induces the opening of HCN channels at physiological membrane potentials, driving a significant decrease in input resistance and excitability. Systemic L-DOPA rescues HCN channel activity, pyramidal excitability in ACC as well as sensory phenotype in neuropathic mice while microinjection of a selective D1-like agonist in ACC induces relief of ongoing pain in neuropathic animals. We conclude that decreased dopaminergic inhibition in ACC plays a critical role in an abnormal top-down modulation leading to neuropathic pain.",

Through this, we identify unrecognized biases that hinder the ML process and result in low model generalizability. Ultimately, we show that, when there is insufficient signal in the training data, ML models are likely to learn primarily from representational biases.",

Here, we used multiplexed, sequencing-based assays to measure the effects of 2,695 VKOR missense variants on abundance and 697 variants on activity in cultured human cells. The large-scale functional data, along with an evolutionary coupling analysis, supports a four transmembrane domain topology, with variants in transmembrane domains exhibiting strongly deleterious effects on abundance and activity. Functionally constrained regions of the protein define the active site, and we find that, of four conserved cysteines putatively critical for function, only three are absolutely required. Finally, 25% of human VKOR missense variants show reduced abundance or activity, possibly conferring warfarin sensitivity or causing disease.",

Androgen hormone synthesis is tightly governed by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, including gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Thimet oligopeptidase (TOP) is a biologically significant peptidase known to cleave GnRH and potentially regulate its activity. Thus, TOP can play an important role in the HPG axis through regulating the downstream production and release of gonadal steroid hormones, including androgens, which may further affect prostate cancer development. TOP is known to be secreted out to the extracellular space. Here, we report that extracellular TOP can be associated with extracellular vesicles (EVs). Western blot analysis of EVs isolated from PC3 or DU145 prostate cancer cells revealed that TOP protein is, indeed, carried by the EVs. Budding of EVs from stimulated PC3 prostate cancer cells can also be visualized by confocal microscopy. Significantly, the TOP enzyme carried by EVs is enzymatically active. The present study shows that EV-associated TOP is a novel form of this extracellular peptidase that may play a role in the disease progression of prostate cancer cells.",

This graph model is often too complex to be used in an inferential setup, but it can be approximated for example by the ClonalOrigin model. Inference in the ClonalOrigin model is performed via a Reversible-Jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which attempts to jointly explore: the recombination rate, the number of recombination events, the departure and arrival points on the clonal genealogy for each recombination event, and the range of genomic sites affected by each recombination event. However, the Reversible-Jump algorithm usually performs poorly due to the complexity of the target distribution since it needs to explore spaces of different dimensions. Recent developments in Bayesian computation methodology have provided ways to improve existing methods and code, but are not well-known outside the statistics community. We show how exploiting one of these new computational methods can lead to faster inference under the ClonalOrigin model.",

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder, in which 97% of patients are familial and sporadic cases associated with TDP-43 proteinopathies and conditions clearing TDP-43 from the nucleus, but we know little about the molecular basis of the disease. Here, we prove that mislocalization of mutated TDP-43 (A382T) in transfected neuronal SH-SY5Y and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from an ALS patient cause R-loop accumulation, and R loop-dependent increased DSBs and Fanconi Anemia repair centers. Similar results were observed in a non-neuronal model of HeLa cells depleted of TDP-43. These results uncover a new role of TDP-43 in the control of co-transcriptional R-loops and the maintenance of genome integrity by preventing harmful R-loop accumulation. Our findings thus link TDP-43 pathology to increased R-loops and R loop-mediated DNA damage opening the possibility that R-loop modulation in TDP-43-defective cells might help develop ALS therapies.",

    "abstract": "Collagens are the main structural components of ECM and collagenolysis is vital for ECM remodelling, which is essential for normal organ homeostasis. Any dysregulation of this process can result in various pathological conditions. The degradation of the interstitial collagens is generally mediated by specific collagenases which are capable of cleaving at specific loci in the collagen triple helix. Lysosomal cysteine cathepsins have general housekeeping as well as some highly specialized functions. Amongst them, human cathepsin K is the only lysosomal cysteine protease which has potent collagenolytic activity against type I collagen. In this study, we have imparted collagenolytic property to another human cysteine protease, cathepsin L, by systematically engineering proline-specificity and GAG-binding surface in the protease. The designed proline-specific mutant shows high specificity for peptidyl substrate containing proline at P2 position but is incapable of cleaving collagen. However, when the proline-specific mutant is further engineered for GAG-binding surface, it can degrade type I collagen in presence of Chondroitin 4-Sulfate (C4-S). We also present high resolution crystal structures of these proline-specific (1.4 [A]) and collagen-specific (1.8 [A]) mutants. Finally docking studies with prolyl-peptidic substrate (Ala-Gly-Pro-Arg-Ala) at the active site and a GAG molecule (C4-S) at the GAG binding site enables us to identify key structural features responsible for collagenolytic activity of papain-like cysteine proteases. This study provides a rational approach to engineer an efficient collagenase from a human template enzyme which may have various noninvasive therapeutic implications with an expected additional advantage of immuno-compatiblity.",

    "abstract": "Pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived organoids are emerging as novel human-based microphysiological models but display immature phenotypes with limited subsets of endothelial or stromal cells. Here we demonstrate that in vitro manipulation of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in PSC-derived liver organoids selected either through computational analysis or targeted tissue design can advance tissue maturation in vitro. Through an unbiased comparison with the genetic signature of mature livers, we identify downregulated GRNs in fetal liver organoids compared to adult livers. We demonstrate that overexpression of PROX1 and ATF5, together with targeted CRISPR-based transcriptional activation of endogenous CYP3A4, drives maturation in vitro. Single cell analyses reveal hepatobiliary-, endothelial-, and stellate-like cell populations. The engineered organoids demonstrate enhanced vasculogenesis, capture native liver characteristics (e.g. FXR signaling, CYP3A4 activity), and exhibit therapeutic potential in mice.

    "abstract": "Exosomes are cell-generated nano-vesicles (30-150 nm) found in most biological fluids. Major components of their cargo are lipids, proteins, RNA, DNA, and non-coding RNAs. Exosomes carry the fingerprint of the parental tumor and as such, may regulate tumor growth, progression and metastasis. We investigated the impact of exosomes on cell proliferation in pediatric acute lymphocytic leukemia and its reversal by silencing of exo-miR-181a.We isolated exosomes from serum of acute lymphocytic leukemia pediatric patients (Exo-PALL) and conditioned medium of leukemic cell lines (Exo-CM) by ultracentrifugation. Gene expression was carried out by q-PCR. We found that Exo-PALL promote cell proliferation in leukemic B cell lines as well as in the control B cell line. This exosome-induced cell proliferation is a precise event with up-regulation of proliferative (PCNA, Ki-67) and pro-survival genes (MCL-1, and BCL2), and suppression of pro-apoptotic genes (BAD, BAX). Exo-PALL and Exo-CM both show over expression of miR-181a compared to controls (Exo-HD). Specific silencing of exosomal miR-181a using a miR-181a inhibitor confirms that miR-181a inhibitor treatment reverses Exo-PALL/Exo-CM-induced leukemic cell proliferation in vitro. Altogether, this study suggests that exosomal miR-181a inhibition can be a novel target for growth suppression in pediatric lymphatic leukemia.",

    "abstract": "Myosin VI is the only minus-end actin motor and is coupled to various cellular processes ranging from endocytosis to transcription. This multi-potent nature is achieved through alternative isoform splicing and interactions with a network of binding partners. There is a complex interplay between isoforms and binding partners to regulate myosin VI. Here, we have compared the regulation of two myosin VI splice isoforms by two different binding partners. By combining biochemical and single-molecule approaches, we propose that myosin VI regulation follows a generic mechanism, independently of the spliced isoform and the binding partner involved. We describe how myosin VI adopts an autoinhibited backfolded state which is released by binding partners. This unfolding activates the motor, enhances actin binding and can subsequently trigger dimerization. We have further expanded our study by using single molecule imaging to investigate the impact of binding partners upon myosin VI molecular organisation and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptionally silent genes must be activated throughout development. This requires nucleosomes be removed from promoters and enhancers to allow transcription factor binding (TFs) and recruitment of coactivators and RNA Polymerase II (Pol II). Specialized pioneer TFs bind nucleosome-wrapped DNA to perform this chromatin opening by mechanisms that remain incompletely understood1-3. Here, we show that GAGA-factor (GAF), a Drosophila pioneer factor4, interacts with both SWI/SNF and ISWI family chromatin remodelers to allow recruitment of Pol II and entry to a promoter-proximal paused state, and also to promote Pol IIs transition to productive elongation. We found that GAF functions with PBAP (SWI/SNF) to open chromatin and allow Pol II to be recruited. Importantly this activity is not dependent on NURF as previously proposed5-7; however, GAF also functions with NURF downstream of this process to ensure efficient Pol II pause release and transition to productive elongation apparently through its role in precisely positioning the +1 nucleosome. These results demonstrate how a single sequence-specific pioneer TF can synergize with remodelers to activate sets of genes. Furthermore, this behavior of remodelers is consistent with findings in yeast8-10 and mice11-13, and likely represents general, conserved mechanisms found throughout Eukarya.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDIn the Australian southeast, the saltmarsh mosquito Aedes vigilax (Skuse) is the focus of area-wide larviciding campaigns employing the biological agent Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis (Bti). Although generally effective, frequent inundating tides and considerable mangrove cover can make control challenging. Here, we describe the efficacy and persistence of an aqueous Bti suspension (potency: 1200 International Toxic Units; strain AM65-52) within a mixed saltmarsh-mangrove system and the use of affordable unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to identify and map problematic levels of mangrove canopy cover.\n\nRESULTSHigh mangrove canopy density (>40% cover) reduced product deposition by 74.5% (0.013{+/-} 0.002 l/cm2 vs. 0.051{+/-} 0.006 l/cm2), larval mortality by 27.7% (60.7{+/-} 4.1% vs. 84.0{+/-} 2.4%), and ground level Bti concentrations by 32.03% (1144 {+/-} 462.6 vs. 1683 {+/-} 447.8 spores ml-1) relative to open saltmarsh. Persistence of product post-application was found to be low (80.6% loss at 6 h) resulting in negligible additional losses to tidal inundation 24 h post-application. UAS surveys accurately identified areas of high mangrove cover using both standard and multispectral imagery, although derived index values for this vegetation class were only moderately correlated with ground measurements (R2=0.17-0.38) at their most informative scales.\n\nCONCLUSIONThese findings highlight the complex operational challenges that affect coastal mosquito control in heterogeneous environments. The problem is exacerbated by continued mangrove transgression into saltmarsh habitat in the region. Emerging UAS technology can help operators optimize treatments by accurately identifying and mapping challenging canopy cover using both standard and multispectral imaging.",

    "abstract": "Sampling of different body regions can reveal highly specialized bacterial associations within the holobiont and facilitate identification of core microbial symbionts that would otherwise be overlooked by bulk sampling methods. Here we characterized compartment-specific associations present within the model cnidarian Nematostella vectensis by dividing its morphology into three distinct body regions. This sampling design allowed us to uncover a capitulum-specific dominance of spirochetes within N. vectensis. Bacteria from the family Spirochaetaceae made up 66% of the community in the capitulum, while only representing 1.2% and 0.1% of the communities in the mesenteries and physa, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis of the predominant spirochete sequence recovered from N. vectensis showed a close relation to spirochetes previously recovered from wild N. vectensis. These sequences clustered closer to the recently described genus Oceanispirochaeta, rather than Spirochaeta perfilievii, supporting them as members of this clade. This suggests a consistent and potentially important association between N. vectensis and spirochetes from the order Spirochaetales.",

    "abstract": "The identity of the cell of origin is a key determinant of cancer subtype, progression and prognosis. Group 3 Medulloblastoma (MB) is a malignant childhood brain cancer with poor prognosis and unknown cell of origin. We overexpressed the Group 3 MB genetic drivers MYC and Gfi1 in different candidate cells of origin in the postnatal mouse cerebellum. We found that S100b+ cells are competent to initiate Group 3 MB, while Math1+, Sox2+ or Ascl1+ cells are not. We noted that S100b+ cells have higher levels of Notch1 pathway activity compared to Math1+ cells. Interestingly, we found that additional activation of Notch1 in Math1+ cells was sufficient to induce Group 3 MB upon MYC/Gfi1 expression. Taken together, our data suggest that the MB cell of origin competence depends on the cellular identity, which relies on Notch1 activity.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/084335v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@83f999org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@77dc49org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11f5267org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15afa34_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here, through DNA affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry, we have identified the widely expressed protein MAZ (Myc-associated zinc finger) as a transcription factor that binds to the promoter of the erythroid-specific human -globin gene. Genome-wide mapping in primary human erythroid cells revealed that MAZ also occupies active promoters as well as GATA1-bound enhancer elements of key erythroid genes. Consistent with an important role during erythropoiesis, knockdown of MAZ in primary human erythroid cells impairs erythroid differentiation, and genetic variants in the MAZ locus are associated with clinically important human erythroid traits. Taken together, these findings reveal the Zinc-finger transcription factor MAZ to be a previously unrecognised regulator of the erythroid differentiation program.",
