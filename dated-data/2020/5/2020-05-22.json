    "abstract": "This paper presents the design, development, and validation of a study among secondary school students\u2019 participation in a novel course on genomic principles and practices by analyzing and documenting evidence of their participation, and educational outcomes, in a novel course on genomic principles and practices. A mixed methods approach, using qualitative and quantitative methods, was used to address three research questions. 1) Based on affective evidence, how did secondary school students perceive and critically judge, content topics learned in a course on modern genomic principles and practices? 2) Based on cognitive evidence, how much of the content did secondary school students learn when they participated in a course on modern genomic principles and practices? 3) Using individual interview evidence, what are the major perceptions that the secondary school students expressed throughout the duration of the course? The participants were provided an opportunity to comment on the course through individual and collaborative interviews, in order to find out to what extent they perceived the course to be interesting and challenging. Future inquiry expanding from this research would help to establish the foundational pathway for designing a more inclusive genomics curriculum. In conclusion, the course offered real-life/real-world applications that encourage all students to conceptualize genomics, human health, diseases, medicine, ethics, beliefs, research, and careers.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Improved genome engineering methods that enable automation of large and precise edits are essential for systematic investigations of genome function. We adapted peel-1 negative selection to an optimized Dual-Marker Selection (DMS) cassette protocol for CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering in Caenorhabditis elegans and observed robust increases in multiple measures of efficiency that were consistent across injectors and four genomic loci. The use of Peel-1-DMS selection killed animals harboring transgenes as extrachromosomal arrays and spared genome edited integrants, often circumventing the need for visual screening to identify genome edited animals. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, we created deletion alleles in the putative proteasomal subunit pbs-1 and the uncharacterized gene K04F10.3 and used machine vision to automatically characterize their phenotypic profiles, revealing homozygous essential and heterozygous behavioral phenotypes. These results provide a robust and scalable approach to rapidly generate and phenotype genome edited animals without the need for screening or scoring by eye.\n\nAuthor summaryThe ability to directly manipulate the genome and observe the resulting effects on the traits of an organism is a powerful approach to investigate gene function. CRISPR-based approaches to genome engineering have revolutionized such functional studies across model organisms but still face major challenges that limit the scope and complexity of projects that can be achieved in practice. Automating genome engineering and phenotyping would enable large-scale investigations of genome function in animals. Here, we describe the adaptation of peel-1 negative selection to an optimized dual-marker selection cassette CRISPR-Cas9 genome engineering method in C. elegans and combine it with automated machine vision phenotyping to achieve functional studies without the need for screening or scoring by eye. To demonstrate the applicability of the approach, we generated novel deletion alleles in two understudied genes, pbs-1 and K04F10.3, and used machine vision to characterize their phenotypic profiles, revealing homozygous lethal and heterozygous behavioral phenotypes. Our results open the door to systematic investigations of genome function in this model organism.",

    "abstract": "Covid-19 morbidity and mortality are associated with a dysregulated immune response. Tools are needed to enhance existing immune profiling capabilities in affected patients. Here we aimed to develop an approach to support the design of focused blood transcriptome panels for profiling the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We designed a pool of candidates based on a pre-existing and well-characterized repertoire of blood transcriptional modules. Available Covid-19 blood transcriptome data was also used to guide this process. Further selection steps relied on expert curation. Additionally, we developed several custom web applications to support the evaluation of candidates. As a proof of principle, we designed three targeted blood transcript panels, each with a different translational connotation: therapeutic development relevance, SARS biology relevance and immunological relevance. Altogether the work presented here may contribute to the future expansion of immune profiling capabilities via targeted profiling of blood transcript abundance in Covid-19 patients.",

The common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath, breathing difficulties, dry cough, fever, and in some patients, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure, and death. 312,009 deaths from COVID-19 has been reported as of today. While respiratory symptoms are commonly caused by the infection, the use of mechanical ventilation is required for some patients. The following is intended to review the development and testing of a 3D printed and open-source mechanical ventilation device that is capable of adjusting breathing rate, volume, and pressure simultaneously and was designed according to the latest clinical observations of the current pandemic. The intuitive design of this device along with the use of primarily 3D printed or readily available components allow the rapid manufacturing and transportation of this ventilation device to the impacted regions.",

    "abstract": "Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is an immunoinhibitory receptor expressed on exhausted T cells during chronic illness. Interaction of PD-1 with its ligand PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) delivers inhibitory signals and impairs proliferation, cytokine production, and cytotoxicity of T cells. We reported that the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is closely associated with T-cell exhaustion and disease progression in bovine chronic infections and canine tumors. Moreover, we found that blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 and PD-L1 restore T-cell functions and may be used in immunotherapy in cattle and dogs. However, the immunological role of the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway remains unclear for chronic equine diseases, including tumors. In this study, we identified nucleotide sequences of equine PD-1 (EqPD-1) and PD-L1 (EqPD-L1) and investigated the role of anti-bovine PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against EqPD-L1 using in vitro assays. We also evaluated the expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissues of equine malignant melanoma (EMM).\n\nThe amino acid sequences of EqPD-1 and EqPD-L1 share a high identity and similarity with homologs from other mammalian species. Two clones of the anti-bovine PD-L1 mAbs recognized EqPD-L1 in flow cytometry, and one of these cross-reactive mAbs blocked the binding of equine PD-1/PD-L1. Importantly, PD-L1 expression was confirmed in EMM tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry. A cultivation assay revealed that PD-L1 blockade enhanced the production of Th1 cytokines in equine immune cells.\n\nThese results suggest that our anti-PD-L1 mAbs may be useful for investigating the expression and role of the equine PD-1/PD-L1 pathway. Further research is required to discover the immunological role of PD-1/PD-L1 in chronic equine diseases and elucidate a future application in immunotherapy for horse.",

    "abstract": "The rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world has revealed major gaps in our ability to respond to new virulent pathogens. Rapid, accurate, and easily configurable molecular diagnostic tests are imperative to prevent global spread of new diseases. CRISPR-based diagnostic approaches are proving to be useful as field-deployable solutions. In a basic form of this assay, the CRISPR-Cas12 enzyme complexes with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA). This complex is activated when it highly specifically binds to target DNA, and the activated complex non-specifically cleaves single-stranded DNA reporter probes labeled with a fluorophore-quencher pair. We recently discovered that electric field gradients can be used to control and accelerate this CRISPR assay by co-focusing Cas12-gRNA, reporters, and target. We achieve an appropriate electric field gradient using a selective ionic focusing technique known as isotachophoresis (ITP) implemented on a microfluidic chip. Unlike previous CRISPR diagnostic assays, we also use ITP for automated purification of target RNA from raw nasopharyngeal swab sample. We here combine this ITP purification with loop-mediated isothermal amplification, and the ITP-enhanced CRISPR assay to achieve detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA (from raw sample to result) in 30 min for both contrived and clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. This electric field control enables a new modality for a suite of microfluidic CRISPR-based diagnostic assays.\n\nSignificance statementRapid, early-stage screening is especially crucial during pandemics for early identification of infected patients and control of disease spread. CRISPR biology offers new methods for rapid and accurate pathogen detection. Despite their versatility and specificity, existing CRISPR-diagnostic methods suffer from the requirements of up-front nucleic acid extraction, large reagent volumes, and several manual steps--factors which prolong the process and impede use in low resource settings. We here combine on-chip electric-field control in combination with CRIPSR biology to directly address these limitations of current CRISPR-diagnostic methods. We apply our method to the rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical samples. Our method takes 30 min from raw sample to result, a significant improvement over existing diagnostic methods for COVID-19.",

We devised twenty-nine sets of search queries comprised of five queries per set to search against the five MEDLINE database platforms. We ran our queries monthly for a year and collected search result count data to observe changes. We found that search results vary considerably depending on MEDLINE platform, both within sets and across time. The variation is due to trends in scholarly publication that include publishing online first versus publishing in journal issues, which leads to metadata differences in the bibliographic record; to differences in the level of specificity among search fields provided by the platforms; to database integrity issues that lead to large fluctuations in monthly search results based on the same query; and to database currency issues that arise due to when each platform updates its MEDLINE file. Specific bibliographic databases, like PubMed and MEDLINE, are used to inform clinical decision-making, create systematic reviews, and construct knowledge bases for clinical decision support systems. Since they serve as essential information retrieval and discovery tools that help identify and collect research data and are used in a broad range of fields and as the basis of multiple research designs, this study should help clinicians, researcher, librarians, informationalists, and others understand how these platforms differ and inform future work in their standardization.",

Herein, we identified 2 secreted bacterial lipases from a Chromobacterium bacterium, named Chromobacterium antiviral effector-1 (CbAE-1) and CbAE-2, with a broad-spectrum virucidal activity against dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV). The CbAEs potently blocked viral infection in the extracellular milieu through their lipase activity. Mechanistic studies showed that this lipase activity directly disrupted the viral envelope structure, thus inactivating infectivity. A mutation of CbAE-1 in its lipase motif fully abrogated the virucidal ability. Furthermore, CbAE-2 presented low toxicity in vivo and in vitro, highlighting its potential as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug.",

Current diagnosis of COVID-19 relies on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR in upper and lower respiratory specimens. While sensitive and specific, these RT-PCR assays require considerable supplies and reagents, which are often limited during global pandemics and surge testing. Here, we show that a nasopharyngeal swab pooling strategy can detect a single positive sample in pools of up to 10 samples without sacrificing RT-PCR sensitivity and specificity. We also report that this pooling strategy can be applied to rapid, moderate complexity assays, such as the BioFire COVID-19 test. Implementing a pooling strategy can significantly increase laboratory testing capacity while simultaneously reducing turnaround times for rapid identification and isolation of positive COVID-19 cases in high risk populations.",

To prevent malaria transmission, the main effective way remains Anopheles control. For an effective control, accurate Anopheles species identification is indispensable to distinguish malaria vectors from non-vectors. Although, morphological and molecular methods are largely used, an innovative tool, based on protein pattern comparisons, the Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption / Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) profiling, emerged this last decade for arthropod identification. However, the limited mosquito fauna diversity of reference MS spectra remains one of the main drawback for it large usage. The aim of the present study was then to create and to share reference MS spectra for the identification of French Guiana Anopheline species. A total of eight distinct Anopheles species, among which four are malaria vectors, were collected in 6 areas. To improve Anopheles identification, two body parts, legs and thoraxes, were independently submitted to MS for the creation of respective reference MS spectra database (DB). This study underlined that double checking by MS enhanced the Anopheles identification confidence and rate of reliable classification. The sharing of this reference MS spectra DB should made easier Anopheles species monitoring in endemic malaria area to help malaria vector control or elimination programs.",

    "abstract": "The products of rumen microbial fermentations are considered essential for animal growth and performance. Changes in these microbial communities can have major effects on animal growth and performance. Saccharin-based artificial sweeteners can be included in livestock diets to increase palatability and encourage feed intake. Despite the importance of the rumen microbial fermentation, little or no research is available regarding how saccharin-based artificial sweeteners affect rumen content and rumen epithelial microbial communities. The aim of this study was to identify changes in both the rumen content and rumen epithelial microbial communities in response to the supplementation of Sucram(R), a sodium-saccharin-based sweetener (Pancosma S.A./ADM Groups, Rolle, Switzerland) during standard, non-stress conditions using 16SrRNA gene amplicon sequencing.\n\nThe rumen epithelial and rumen content microbiota of five Holstein-Friesian milking dairy cattle were compared before (baseline, BL) and after a 28-day supplementation of Sucram(R). Illumina MiSeq-based 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted, and community analysis revealed significant changes in the abundance of specific phylotypes when comparing BL to Sucram(R) experimental groups. Sucram(R) did not have a significant effect on overall rumen microbial community structure between experimental groups. Statistically significant changes in microbial community composition following Sucram(R) supplementation were observed most consistently across a number of bacterial taxa in the rumen epithelium, while fewer changes were seen in the rumen content. Predicted genomic potentials of several significantly different OTUs were mined for genes related to feed efficiency and saccharin degradation. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) classified as Prevotella and Sharpea were significantly (p<0.05) increased in samples supplemented with Sucram(R), whereas a reduction in abundance was seen for OTUs classified as Treponema, Leptospiraceae, Ruminococcus and methanogenic archaea. This is the first study to report an effect of Sucram(R) on ruminant microbial communities, suggesting possible beneficial impacts of Sucram(R) on animal health and performance that may extend beyond increasing feed palatability.",

However, how the category of food (more specifically, fruits and vegetables) fits into this distinction has been difficult to interpret, given a pattern of deficit that has inconsistently mapped onto either kind, despite its intuitive membership to the natural domain. The present study explores the effects of a manipulation of a visual sensory (i.e., color) or functional (i.e., orientation) feature on the consequential semantic processing of fruits and vegetables (and tools, by comparison), first at the behavioral and then at the neural level. The categorization of natural (i.e., fruits/vegetables) and artificial (i.e., utensils) entities was investigated via cross-modal priming. Reaction time analysis indicated a reduction in priming for color-modified natural entities and orientation-modified artificial entities. Standard event-related potentials (ERP) analysis was performed, in addition to linear classification. For natural entities, a N400 effect at central channel sites was observed for the color-modified condition compared relative to normal and orientation conditions, with this difference confirmed by classification analysis. Conversely, there was no significant difference between conditions for the artificial category in either analysis. These findings provide strong evidence that color is an integral property to the categorization of fruits/vegetables, thus substantiating the claim that feature-based processing guides as a function of semantic category.",

    "abstract": "Graph theoretical analyses of nervous systems usually omit the aspect of connection polarity, due to data insufficiency. The chemical synapse network of Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-reconstructed directed network, but the signs of its connections are yet to be elucidated. Here, we present the gene expression-based sign prediction of the C. elegans connectome, incorporating presynaptic neurotransmitter and postsynaptic receptor gene expression data (3,638 connections and 20,589 synapses total). We made successful predictions for more than two-thirds of all chemical synapses and determined a ratio of excitatory-inhibitory (E:I) interneuronal ionotropic chemical connections close to 4:1 which was found similar to that observed in many real-world networks. Our open source tool (http://EleganSign.linkgroup.hu) is simple but efficient in predicting polarities by integrating neuronal connectome and gene expression data.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe fundamental way neurons communicate is by activating or inhibiting each other via synapses. The balance between the two is crucial for the optimal functioning of a nervous system. However, whole-brain synaptic polarity information is unavailable for any species and experimental validation is challenging. The roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans possesses a fully mapped connectome with a comprehensive gene expression profile of its 302 neurons. Based on the consideration that the polarity of a synapse must be determined by the neurotransmitter(s) expressed in the presynaptic neuron and the receptors expressed in the postsynaptic neuron, we conceptualized and created a tool that predicts synaptic polarities based on connectivity and gene expression information. We were able to show for the first time that the ratio of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in C. elegans is around 4 to 1 which is in line with the balance observed in many natural systems. Our method opens a way to include spatial and temporal dynamics of synaptic polarity that would add a new dimension of plasticity in the excitatory:inhibitory balance. Our tool is freely available to be used on any network accompanied by any expression atlas.",

    "abstract": "PurposeAlthough high-velocity contractions elicit greater muscle fatigue in older than young adults, the cause of this difference is unclear. We examined the potential roles of resting muscle architecture and baseline contractile properties, as well as changes in voluntary activation and low-frequency fatigue in response to high-velocity knee extensor work.\n\nMethodsVastus lateralis muscle architecture was determined in quiescent muscle by ultrasonography in 8 young (23.4{+/-}1.8 yrs) and 8 older women (69.6{+/-}1.1). Maximal voluntary dynamic (MVDC) and isometric (MVIC), and stimulated (80Hz and 10Hz, 500ms) isometric contractions were performed before and immediately after 120 MVDCs (240{degrees}{middle dot}s-1, one every 2s).\n\nResultsArchitecture variables did not differ between groups (p[&ge;]0.209), but the half-time of torque relaxation (T1/2) was longer in older than young women at baseline (151.9{+/-}6.0 vs. 118.8{+/-}4.4 ms, respectively, p=0.001). Older women fatigued more than young (to 33.6{+/-}4.7% vs. 55.2{+/-}4.2% initial torque, respectively; p=0.004), with no evidence of voluntary activation failure ({Delta}MVIC:80Hz torque) in either group (p[&ge;]0.317). Low-frequency fatigue ({Delta}10:80Hz torque) occurred in both groups (p<0.001), as did slowing of T1/2 (p=0.001), with no differences between groups. Baseline T1/2 was inversely associated with fatigue in older (r2=0.584, p=0.045), but not young women (r2=0.147, p=0.348).\n\nConclusionsThese results indicate that differences in muscle architecture, voluntary activation, and low-frequency fatigue do not explain the greater fatigue of older compared with young women during high-velocity contractions. The inverse association between baseline T1/2 and fatigue in older women suggests that factors related to slower muscle contractile properties may be protective against fatigue during fast, repetitive contractions in aging.",

We analysed 2363 sequences of the Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 isolates and identified variability in 44 amino acid residues and their worldwide distribution in all continents. We used the three-dimensional structure of the homo-trimer model to predict conformational epitopes of B-cell, and sequence of Spike protein Wuhan-Hu-1 to predict linear epitopes of T-Cytotoxic and T-Helper cells. We identified 45 epitopes with amino acid variations. Finally, we showed the distribution of mutations within the epitopes.

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) genetic micro-diversity in clinical isolates may underline mycobacterial adaptive response during the course of tuberculosis (TB) and provide insights to anti-TB treatment response and emergence of resistance. Herein we followed within-host evolution of Mtb clinical isolates in a cohort of patients with delayed Mtb culture conversion. We captured the genetic diversity of both the initial and the last Mtb isolate obtained in each patient, by focusing on minor variants detected as unfixed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To unmask antibiotic tolerant sub-populations, we exposed the last Mtb isolate to rifampicin (RIF) prior to whole genome sequencing analysis. We were able to detect unfixed SNPs within the Mtb isolates for 9/12 patients, and non-synonymous (ns) SNPs in 6/12 patients. Furthermore, RIF exposure revealed 8 additional unfixed nsSNP unlinked to drug resistance. To better understand the dynamics of Mtb micro-diversity during the course of TB, we investigated the variant composition of a persistent Mtb clinical isolate before and after controlled stress experiments chosen to mimic the course of TB disease. A minor variant, featuring a particular mycocerosates profile, became enriched during both RIF exposure and macrophage infection. The variant was associated with drug tolerance and intracellular persistence, consistent with the pharmacological modeling predicting increased risk of treatment failure. A thorough study of such variants, not necessarily linked to canonical drug-resistance and which may be able to promote anti-TB drug tolerance, may be crucial to prevent the subsequent emergence of resistance. Taken together, the present findings support the further exploration of Mtb micro-diversity as a promising tool to detect patients at risk of poorly responding to anti-TB treatment, ultimately allowing improved and personalized TB management.\n\nAuthor summaryTuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), bacteria that are able to persist inside the patient for many months or years, thus requiring long antibiotic treatments. Here we focused on TB patients with delayed response to treatment and we performed genetic characterization of Mtb isolates to search for sub-populations that may tolerate anti-TB drugs. We found that Mtb cultured from 9/12 patients contained different sub-populations, and in vitro drug exposure revealed 8 other sub-populations, none related to known drug-resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, we characterized a Mtb variant isolated from a sub-population growing in the presence of rifampicin (RIF), a major anti-TB drug. We found that this variant featured a modified lipidic envelope, and that it was able to develop in the presence of RIF and inside human macrophage cells. We performed pharmacological modelling and found that this kind of variant may be related to a poor response to treatment. In conclusion, searching for particular Mtb sub-populations may help to detect patients at risk of treatment failure and provide additional guidance for TB management.",

    "abstract": "Gillnets made of the biodegradable resin polybutylene succinate co-adipate-co-terephthalate (PBSAT) were tested under commercial fishing conditions to compare their fishing performance with that of conventional nylon polyamide (PA) gillnets. Both types of gillnets were made of 0.55 mm \u00d8 monofilaments. However, since the biodegradable nets are weaker than nylon PA nets when using the same monofilament diameter, we also used biodegradable nets made of 0.60 mm \u00d8 monofilament that had a similar tensile strength to the 0.55 mm \u00d8 nylon PA nets. The relative catch efficiency of the different gillnet types was evaluated over the 2018 autumn fishing season for saithe and cod in northern Norway. For cod, both biodegradable gillnets (0.55 and 0.60 mm) had a significantly lower catch efficiency compared to the traditional nylon PA net (0.55 mm) with estimated catch efficiencies of 62.38% (CI: 50.55\u201374.04) and 54.96% (CI: 35.42\u201373.52) compared with the nylon PA net, respectively. Similarly for saithe, both biodegradable gillnets (0.55 and 0.60 mm) had a lower estimated catch efficiency compared to the traditional nylon PA net (0.55 mm) with estimated catch efficiencies of 83.40% (71.34\u201394.86) and 83.87% (66.36\u2013104.92), compared with the nylon PA net, respectively. Tensile strength does not explain the differences in catch efficiency between the two gillnet types, since increasing the twine diameter of the biodegradable gillnets (to match the strength of nylon PA gillnets) did not yield similar catch efficiencies. However, the elasticity and stiffness of the materials may be responsible for the differences in catch efficiency between the nylon PA and biodegradable gillnets.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Even for the genetically accessible yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the CRISPR/Cas DNA editing technology has strongly accelerated and facilitated strain construction. Several methods have been validated for fast and highly efficient single editing events and diverse approaches for multiplex genome editing have been described in literature by means of Cas9 or Cas12a endonucleases and their associated gRNAs. The gRNAs used to guide the Cas endonuclease to the editing site are typically expressed from plasmids using native PolII or PolIII RNA polymerases. These gRNA-expression plasmids require laborious, time-consuming cloning steps, which hampers their implementation for academic and applied purposes. In this study, we explore the potential of expressing gRNA from linear DNA fragments using the T7 RNA polymerase (T7RNAP) for single and multiplex genome editing in S. cerevisiae. Using Cas12a, this work demonstrates that transforming short, linear DNA fragments encoding gRNAs in yeast strains expressing T7RNAP promotes highly efficient single DNA editing. These DNA fragments can be custom-ordered, which makes this approach highly suitable for high-throughput strain construction. This work expands the CRISPR-toolbox for large-scale strain construction programs in S. cerevisiae and promises to be relevant for other, less genetically accessible yeast species.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the binding to the permissive cells. The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S protein directly interacts with the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane. In this study, we used computational saturation mutagenesis approaches, including structure-based energy calculations and sequence-based pathogenicity predictions, to quantify the systemic effects of missense mutations on SARS-CoV-2 S protein structure and function. A total of 18,354 mutations in S protein were analyzed and we discovered that most of these mutations could destabilize the entire S protein and its RBD. Specifically, residues G431 and S514 in SARS-CoV-2 RBD are important for S protein stability. We analyzed 384 experimentally verified S missense variations and revealed that the dominant pandemic form, D614G, can stabilize the entire S protein. Moreover, many mutations in N-linked glycosylation sites can increase the stability of the S protein. In addition, we investigated 3,705 mutations in SARS-CoV-2 RBD and 11,324 mutations in human ACE2 and found that SARS-CoV-2 neighbor residues G496 and F497 and ACE2 residues D355 and Y41 are critical for the RBD-ACE2 interaction. The findings comprehensively provide potential target sites in the development of drugs and vaccines against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Ring ATPases that translocate disordered polymers possess lock-washer architectures that they impose on their substrates during transport via a hand-over-hand mechanism. Here, we investigate the operation of ring motors that transport substrates possessing a preexisting helical structure, such as the bacteriophage {phi}29 dsDNA packaging motor. During each cycle, this pentameric motor tracks one helix strand (the  tracking strand), and alternates between two segregated phases: a dwell in which it exchanges ADP for ATP and a burst in which it packages a full turn of DNA in four steps. We challenge this motor with DNA-RNA hybrids and dsRNA substrates and find that it adapts the size of its burst to the corresponding shorter helical pitches by keeping three of its power strokes invariant while shortening the fourth. Intermittently, the motor loses grip when the tracking strand is RNA, indicating that it makes load-bearing contacts with the substrate that are optimal with dsDNA. The motor possesses weaker grip when ADP-bound at the end of the burst. To rationalize all these observations, we propose a helical inchworm translocation mechanism in which the motor increasingly adopts a lock-washer structure during the ATP loading dwell and successively regains its planar form with each power stroke during the burst.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat, including in sub-Saharan Africa. However, little is known about the genetics of resistant bacteria in the region. In Malawi, there is growing concern about increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance to most empirically used antimicrobials. The highly drug resistant Escherichia coli sequence type (ST) 131, which is associated with the extended spectrum {beta}-lactamase blaCTX-M-15, has been increasing in prevalence globally. Previous data from isolates collected between 2006-2013 in southern Malawi have shown the presence of ST131 and the blaCTX-M-15 gene in the country. We performed whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 58 clinical E. coli isolates at Kamuzu Central Hospital, a tertiary care center in central Malawi, collected from 2012-2018. We used Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing, which was performed in Malawi. We show that ST131 has become more prevalent (14.9% increasing to 32.8%) and that the blaCTX-M-15gene is occurring at a higher frequency (21.3% increasing to 44.8%). Phylogenetics show isolates are highly related between the central and southern geographic regions and confirm that ST131 isolates are contained in a single group consistent with recent expansion. All AMR genes, including blaCTX-M-15, were widely distributed across sequence types. We also identified an increased number of ST410 isolates, which in this study tend to carry a plasmid-located copy of blaCTX-M-15 gene at a higher frequency than blaCTX-M-15 occurs in ST131. This study confirms the expanding nature of ST131 and the wide distribution of the blaCTX-M-15 gene in Malawi. We also highlight the feasibility of conducting longitudinal genomic epidemiology studies of important bacteria with the sequencing done on site using a nanopore platform that requires minimal infrastructure.\n\nDATA SUMMARYThe sequencing data used for this analysis is available in public data repositories.

Destructive sampling of the petrous pyramid, assuming its recovery, is often not recommended for highly valued specimens. To investigate alternatives, we present a survey of human aDNA preservation for each of ten skeletal elements in a skeletal collection from Medieval Germany. Through comparison of human DNA content and quality we confirm best performance of the petrous pyramid and identify seven additional sampling locations across four skeletal elements that yield adequate aDNA for most applications in human palaeogenetics.

    "abstract": "Adult skeletal muscles are maintained during homeostasis and regenerated upon injury by muscle stem cells (MuSCs). A heterogeneity in self-renewal, differentiation and regeneration properties has been reported for MuSCs based on their anatomical location. Although MuSCs derived from extraocular muscles (EOM) have a higher regenerative capacity than those derived from limb muscles, the molecular determinants that govern these differences remain undefined. Here we show that EOM and limb MuSCs have distinct DNA methylation signatures associated with enhancers of location-specific genes, and that the EOM transcriptome is reprogrammed following transplantation into a limb muscle environment. Notably, EOM MuSCs expressed host-site specific positional Hox codes after engraftment and self-renewal within the host muscle. However, about 10% of EOM-specific genes showed engraftment-resistant expression, pointing to cell-intrinsic molecular determinants of the higher engraftment potential of EOM MuSCs. Our results underscore the molecular diversity of distinct MuSC populations and molecularly define their plasticity in response to microenvironmental cues. These findings provide insights into strategies designed to improve the functional capacity of MuSCs in the context of regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Regulons for many transcription factors have been elucidated in model strains leading to an understanding of their role in producing physiological states. Comparative analysis of a regulon and its target genes between different strains of the same species is lacking. Ferric uptake regulator (Fur), involved in iron homeostasis, is one of the most conserved TFs, and is present in a wide range of bacteria. Using ChIP-exo experiments, we performed a comprehensive study of Fur binding sites in nine Escherichia coli strains with different lifestyles. 79 of the 431 target genes (18%) found belong to Fur core regulon, comprising genes involved in ion transport and metabolism, energy production and conversion, and amino acid metabolism and transport. 179 of the target genes (42%) comprise the accessory regulon, most of which were related to cell wall structure and biogenesis, and virulence factor pathways. The remaining target genes (173 or 40%) were in the unique regulon, with gene functions that were largely unknown. Furthermore, deletion of the fur gene led to distinct phenotypes in growth, motility, antibiotic resistance, and the change of siderophore production. These results provide a more complete understanding of how Fur regulates a set of target genes with surprising variation in closely related bacteria.",

    "abstract": "To characterize how protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks change, we quantified the relative PPI abundance of 1.6 million protein pairs in yeast across 9 growth conditions, with replication, for a total of 44 million measurements. Our multi-condition screen identified 13,764 pairwise PPIs, a 3-fold increase over PPIs identified in one condition. A few \"immutable\" PPIs are present across all conditions, while most \"mutable\" PPIs are rarely observed. Immutable PPIs aggregate into highly connected \"core\" network modules, with most network remodeling occurring within a loosely connected \"accessory\" module. Mutable PPIs are less likely to co-express, co-localize, and be explained by simple mass action kinetics, and more likely to contain proteins with intrinsically disordered regions, implying that environment-dependent association and binding is critical to cellular adaptation. Our results show that protein interactomes are larger than previously thought and contain highly dynamic regions that reorganize to drive or respond to cellular changes.",

    "abstract": "Feed efficiency (FE) is an economically important trait. Thus, reliable predictors would help to reduce the production cost and provide sustainability to the pig industry. We carried out metabolome-transcriptome integration analysis on 40 purebred Duroc and Landrace male uncastrated pigs to identify potential gene-metabolite interactions and explore the molecular mechanism underlying FE. To this end, we applied untargeted metabolomics and RNA-seq approaches to the same animals. After data quality control, we used a linear model approach to integrate the data and find significant differently correlated gene-metabolite pairs separately for the breeds (Duroc and Landrace) and FE groups (low and high FE) followed by a pathway over-representation analysis. We identified 21 and 12 significant gene-metabolite pairs for each group. The valine-leucine-isoleucine biosynthesis/degradation and arginine-proline metabolism pathways were associated with unique metabolites. The unique genes obtained from significant metabolite-gene pairs were associated with sphingolipid catabolism, multicellular organismal process, cGMP, and purine metabolic processes. While some of the genes and metabolites identified were known for their association with FE, others are novel and provide new avenues for further research. Further validation of genes, metabolites, and gene-metabolite interactions in larger cohorts will help us to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms and pathways underlying FE.",
