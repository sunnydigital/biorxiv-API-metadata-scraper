    "abstract": "How the intrinsic sequence structure of neonatal mouse pup ultrasonic vocalization (USV) and maternal experiences determine maternal behaviors in mice is poorly understood. Our previous work showed that pups with a Tbx1 heterozygous (HT) mutation, a genetic risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), emit altered call sequences that do not induce maternal approach behaviors in C57BL6/J mothers. Here, we tested how maternal approach behaviors induced by wild-type and HT USVs are influenced by the mothers experience in raising pups of these two genotypes. The results showed that wild-type USVs were effective in inducing maternal approach behaviors when mothers raised wild-type but not HT pups. The USVs of HT pups were ineffective regardless of whether mothers raised HT or wild-type pups. However, the sequence structure of pup USVs had no effect on the general, non-directional incentive motivation of maternal behaviors. Our data show how the mothers experience with a pup with a genetic risk for ASD alters the intrinsic incentive values of USV sequences in maternal approach behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Purple corn offers an attractive source of economical natural anthocyanin-based colorant for use in foods and beverages. Yet to maximize the scalability and meet growing demands, both anthocyanin concentrations and agronomic performance must improve in purple corn varieties. We studied flux through the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway using GWAS data derived from a diverse purple corn landrace with anthocyanin-rich pericarp, Apache Red. Trends between flavonoid endpoints suggest that regulators of total flux into the pathway and regulators of partitioning within the pathway may both represent targets for maximizing anthocyanin content. A peak at the end of chromosome 1 near Aat1 (Anthocyanin acyltransferase1) was highly significant in all approaches taken to map anthocyanin flux, suggesting the structural modification of malonylation is required for maximal anthocyanin production. We also identified several candidate MATEs and H+ ATPases that could assist in the preferential transport of acylated anthocyanins into the vacuole. These and other candidates identified here suggest there is still much to learn about the regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis in the pericarp of purple corn. The efficacy of genomic predictions in the population was also studied, yielding an accuracy of 0.71 with cross validation for total anthocyanin content with no improvement found when known anthocyanin regulators were added to the model. These data suggest that genomic selection could be employed effectively in a purple corn breeding program, and especially for a landrace improvement program.",

While some success has been observed by injecting materials to regenerate new tissue, optimal biomaterial stiffness to thicken and stiffen infarcted myocardium to limit adverse remodeling has not been determined. In this work, we present an in-vivo study of the impact of biomaterial stiffness over a wide range of stiffness moduli on ventricular mechanics. We utilized injectable methacrylated polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels fabricated at 3 different mechanical moduli: 5 kPa (low), 25 kPa (medium/myocardium), and 250 kPa (high/supraphysiologic). We demonstrate that the supraphysiological high stiffness favorably alters post-infarct ventricular mechanics and prevents negative tissue remodeling. Lower stiffness materials do not alter mechanics and thus to be effective, must instead target biological reparative mechanisms. These results may influence rationale design criteria for biomaterials developed for infarct reinforcement therapy.",

    "abstract": "Rapid ascent to High Altitude (HA) can cause severe damage to body organs and may lead to many fatal disorders. During induction to HA, human body undergoes various physiological, biochemical, hematological and molecular changes to adapt to the extreme environmental conditions. Many literature references hint that gene-expression-regulation and regulatory molecules like microRNAs (miRNAs) and Transcription Factors (TFs) control adaptive responses during HA-stress. These biomolecules are known to interact in a complex combinatorial manner to fine-tune the gene expression and help in controlling the molecular responses during this stress and ultimately help in acclimatization. HAHmiR.DB (High-Altitude Human miRNA Database) is a unique, comprehensive, curated collection of miRNAs that have been experimentally validated to be associated with HA-stress; their level of expression in different altitudes, fold change, experiment duration, biomarker association, disease and drug association, tissue-specific expression level, Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathway associations. As a server platform it also uniquely constructs and analyses interactive miRNA-TF-Gene coregulatory networks and extracts regulatory-circuits/Feed Forward Loops (FFLs) using in-house scripts. These regulatory circuits help to offer mechanistic insights in complex regulatory mechanisms during HA stress. The server can also build these regulatory networks between two and more miRNAs of the database and also identify the regulatory-circuits from this network. Hence HAHmiR.DB is the first-of its-kind database in HA research which a reliable platform to explore, compare, analyse and retrieve miRNAs associated with HA stress, their coregulatory networks and FFL regulatory circuits.

    "abstract": "In the auditory system, tonotopy is postulated to be the substrate for a place code, where sound frequency is encoded by the location of the neurons that fire during the stimulus. Though conceptually simple, the computations that allow for the representation of intensity and complex sounds are poorly understood. Here, a mathematical framework is developed in order to define clearly the conditions that support a place code. To accommodate both frequency and intensity information, the neural network is described as a topological space with elements that represent individual neurons and clusters of neurons. A bijective mapping is then constructed from acoustic space to neural space so that frequency and intensity are encoded, respectively, by the location and size of the clusters. Algebraic operations -addition and multiplication- are derived to elucidate the rules for representing, assembling, and modulating multi-frequency sound in networks. The predicted outcomes of these operations are consistent with network simulations as well as with electrophysiological and psychophysical data. The analyses show how both frequency and intensity can be encoded with a purely place code, without the need for rate or temporal coding schemes. The algebraic operations are used to describe loudness summation and suggest a mechanism for the critical band. The mathematical approach complements experimental and computational approaches and provides a foundation for interpreting data and constructing models.\n\nAuthor SummaryOne way of encoding sensory information in the brain is with a so-called place code. In the auditory system, tones of increasing frequencies activate sets of neurons at progressively different locations along an axis. The goal of this study is to elucidate the mathematical principles for representing tone frequency and intensity in neural networks. The rigorous, formal process ensures that the conditions for a place code and the associated computations are defined precisely. This mathematical approach offers new insights into experimental data and a framework for constructing network models.",

    "abstract": "When in a new situation, the nervous system may benefit from adapting its control policy. In determining whether or not to initiate this adaptation, the nervous system may rely on some features of the new situation. Here we tested whether one such feature is salient cost savings. We changed cost saliency by manipulating the gradient of participants energetic cost landscape during walking. We hypothesized that steeper gradients would cause participants to spontaneously adapt their step frequency to lower costs. To manipulate the gradient, a mechatronic system applied controlled fore-aft forces to the waist of participants as a function of their step frequency as they walked on a treadmill. These forces increased the energetic cost of walking at high step frequencies and reduced it at low step frequencies. We successfully created three cost landscapes of increasing gradients, where the natural variability in participants step frequency provided cost changes of 3.6% (shallow), 7.2% (intermediate) and 10.2% (steep). Participants did not spontaneously initiate adaptation in response to any of the gradients. Using metronome-guided walking-- a previously established protocol for eliciting initiation of adaptation--participants next experienced a step frequency with a lower cost. Participants then adapted by -1.41{+/-}0.81 (p=0.007) normalized units away from their originally preferred step frequency obtaining cost savings of 4.80{+/-}3.12%. That participants would adapt under some conditions, but not in response to steeper cost gradients, suggests that the nervous system does not solely rely on the gradient of energetic cost to initiate adaptation in novel situations.",

    "abstract": "Functional brain imaging in humans is almost exclusively performed using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. This typically requires a period of tens of milliseconds after excitation of the spin system to achieve maximum contrast, leading to inefficient use of acquisition time, reduced image quality, and inhomogeneous sensitivity throughout the cortex. We utilise magnetisation transfer to suppress the signal differentially from grey matter relative to blood so that the local increase in blood volume associated with brain activation (mainly occurring in the arterioles and capillaries) will increase the measured signal. Arterial blood contrast (ABC) is additive to the residual BOLD effect, but will have its maximum value at the time of excitation. We measured brain activation using combined ABC and residual BOLD contrast at different times post-excitation and compared this to BOLD data acquired under otherwise identical conditions. We conclude that using ABC and measuring shortly after excitation gives comparable sensitivity to standard BOLD but will provide greater efficiency, spatial specificity, improved image quality, and lower inter-subject variability. ABC offers new perspectives for performing functional MRI.",

    "abstract": "Foraging opportunities are a key component of enrichment in captive nonhuman primates providing manipulative opportunities in which animals can engage in species-typical behaviors. Recent studies suggest captive NHP populations have increased body weight over time leading to negative health outcomes. Increasing food foraging opportunities provides added calories that can be estimated but often are not directly measured. We assessed 10 commonly used foraging puzzles for the amount of foraging material they held; evaluated the range of caloric content delivered; and determine the labor and usage cost of each. Five preparation areas were sampled. The amount of foraging material contained in each prepared puzzle was calculated by subtracting the average empty puzzle weight from the loaded puzzle weight. A detailed description of food content was used to illustrate caloric content. Larger prepared puzzles held more food (M=104.9 g) as compared to small volumes puzzles (M=59.8 g). Analysis of the weight of food applied and caloric content suggest larger puzzles do have the potential to provide increased caloric load; however, the added food from large foraging puzzles constitutes only 5%-10% of the daily k/cal dietary requirement. The study illustrates the importance of considering puzzle characteristics when selecting foraging toys and discusses the considerations of cost of puzzle deployment, maintenance and interactive benefit. The broad significance of our assessment suggests that calories from foraging opportunities are not excessive and can be managed by adopting standard serving sizes and scheduling intermitted presentation of non-nutritive enrichment options.",

    "abstract": "In the embryonic brain, dynamic regulation of apical adhesion is fundamental to generate correct numbers and identity of precursors and neurons. Radial glial cells (RGC) in the cerebral cortex are tightly attached to adjacent neighbours. However, cells committed to differentiate reduce their adhesiveness to detach and settle at distal position from the apical border. Whether diffusible signals delivered from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contribute to the regulation of apical adhesion dynamics remain fully unknown. Here we report that unconventional pre-formed complexes of class3-Semaphorins (Sema) and Neuropilins (Nrp) are released into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from sources including the choroid plexus. Through analysis of mutant mouse models and various ex vivo assays, we propose that two different complexes, Sema3B/Nrp2 and Sema3F/Nrp1, bind to apical endfeet of RGCs, and exert dual regulation of their attachment, nuclei dynamics, that oppositely promotes or inhibits basal progenitor and neuron differentiation. This reveals unexpected contributions of CSF-delivered guidance molecules during cortical development.",

Here, we report anxiogenic behaviors, anhedonia, and female hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity as a consequence of psychosocial PS in mice. Sex-specific placental responses to stress and evidence of fetal amygdala programming precede these abnormalities. In adult offspring, we observe amygdalar transcriptional changes demonstrating sex-specific dysfunction in synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter systems. We find these abnormalities are primarily driven by in-utero stress exposure. Importantly, maternal care changes postnatally reverse anxiety-related behaviors and partially rescue gene alterations associated with neurotransmission.

    "abstract": "Optoretinography - the non-invasive, optical imaging of light-induced functional activity in the retina - stands to provide a critical biomarker for testing the safety and efficacy of new therapies as well as their rapid translation to the clinic. Optical phase change in response to light, as readily accessible in phase-resolved OCT, offers a path towards all-optical imaging of retinal function. However, typical human eye motion adversely affects phase stability and precludes the recording of fast light-induced retinal events. Here we introduce a high-speed line-scan spectral domain OCT with adaptive optics (AO), aimed at volumetric imaging and phase-resolved acquisition of retinal responses to light. By virtue of parallel acquisition of an entire retinal cross-section (B-scan) in a single high-speed camera frame, depth-resolved tomograms at speeds up to 16 kHz were achieved with high sensitivity and phase stability. To optimize spectral and spatial resolution, an anamorphic detection paradigm was introduced enabling improved light collection efficiency and signal roll-off compared to traditional methods. The benefits in speed, resolution and sensitivity were exemplified in imaging nanometer-millisecond scale light-induced optical path length changes in cone photoreceptor outer segments. With 660 nm stimuli, individual cone responses readily segregated into three clusters, corresponding to long, middle and short-wavelength cones. Recording such optoretinograms on spatial scales ranging from individual cones, to 100 m-wide retinal patches offers a robust and sensitive biomarker for cone function in health and disease. Furthermore, incorporating this capability into an easy-to-use and ubiquitous diagnostic platform of OCT enables its widespread application to patient care and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are plant root symbionts that play key roles in plant growth and soil fertility. They are obligate biotrophic fungi that form coenocytic multinucleated hyphae and spores. Numerous studies have shown that diverse microorganisms live on the surface and inside their mycelia, resulting in a metagenome when whole genome sequencing (WGS) data are obtained from sequencing AMF cultivated in vivo. The metagenome contains not only the AMF sequences, but also those from associated microorganisms. In this article, we introduce a novel bioinformatics program, SeSaMe, designed for taxonomic classification of short sequences obtained by next-generation DNA sequencing. A genus-specific usage bias database was created based on amino acid usage and codon usage of three consecutive codon DNA 9-mers encoding for an amino acid trimer in a protein secondary structure. The program distinguishes between coding sequence (CDS) and non-CDS, and classifies a query sequence into a genus group out of 54 genera used as reference. The average correct prediction percentages of the CDS and the non-CDS test sets at the genus level were 71% and 50% for bacteria, 65% and 73% for fungi (excluding AMF), and 49% and 72% for AMF (Rhizophagus irregularis), respectively. The program provides a means for estimating not only taxonomic diversity and abundance but also the gene reservoir of the reference taxonomic groups associated with AMF. Therefore, the program enables users to study the symbiotic roles of associated microorganisms. SeSaMe can be applicable to other microorganisms as well as soil metagenomes.

    "abstract": "Genomic profiles of cancer cells provide valuable information on genetic alterations in cancer. Several recent studies employed these data to predict the response of cancer cell lines to treatment with drugs. Nonetheless, due to the multifactorial phenotypes and intricate mechanisms of cancer, the accurate prediction of the effect of pharmacotherapy on a specific cell line based on the genetic information alone is problematic. High prediction accuracies reported in the literature likely result from significant overlaps among training, validation, and testing sets, making many predictors inapplicable to new data. To address these issues, we developed GraphGR, a graph neural network with sophisticated attention propagation mechanisms to predict the therapeutic effects of kinase inhibitors across various tumors. Emphasizing on the system-level complexity of cancer, GraphGR integrates multiple heterogeneous data, such as biological networks, genomics, inhibitor profiling, and genedisease associations, into a unified graph structure. In order to construct diverse and information-rich cancer-specific networks, we devised a novel graph reduction protocol based on not only the topological information, but also the biological knowledge. The performance of GraphGR, properly cross-validated at the tissue level, is 0.83 in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristics, which is notably higher than those measured for other approaches on the same data. Finally, several new predictions are validated against the biomedical literature demonstrating that GraphGR generalizes well to unseen data, i.e. it can predict therapeutic effects across a variety of cancer cell lines and inhibitors.

    "abstract": "The scientific community has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by rapidly undertaking research to find effective strategies to reduce the burden of this disease. Encouragingly, researchers from a diverse array of fields are collectively working towards this goal. Research with infectious SARS-CoV-2 is undertaken in high containment laboratories, however, it is often desirable to work with samples at lower containment levels. To facilitate the transfer of infectious samples from high containment laboratories, we have tested methods commonly used to inactivate virus and prepare the sample for additional experiments. Incubation at 80{degrees}C, and a range of detergents and UV energies were successful at inactivating a high titre of SARS-CoV-2. These protocols can provide a framework for in house inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in other laboratories, ensuring the safe use of samples in lower containment levels.",

Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of muscle tissue following trauma. In this study, biomimetic sponges composed of gelatin, collagen, laminin-111, and FK-506 were used for the treatment of VML in a rodent model. We observed that biomimetic sponge treatment improved muscle structure and function while modulating inflammation and limiting the extent of fibrotic tissue deposition. Specifically, sponge treatment increased the total number of myofibers, type 2B fiber cross-sectional area, myosin: collagen ratio, myofibers with central nuclei, and peak isometric torque compared to untreated VML injured muscles. As an acellular scaffold, biomimetic sponges provide a promising \"off-the-shelf\" clinical therapy for VML.",

    "abstract": "Neural language representation models such as BERT [1] have recently shown state of the art performance in downstream NLP tasks and bio-medical domain adaptation of BERT (Bio-BERT [2]) has shown same behavior on biomedical text mining tasks. However, due to their large model size and resulting increased computational need, practical application of models such as BERT is challenging making smaller models with comparable performance desirable for real word applications. Recently, a new language transformers based language representation model named ELECTRA [3] is introduced, that makes efficient usage of training data in a generative-discriminative neural model setting that shows performance gains over BERT. These gains are especially impressive for smaller models. Here, we introduce a small ELECTRA based model named Bio-ELECTRA that is eight times smaller than BERT BASE and achieves comparable performance on biomedical question answering and yes/no question answer classification tasks. The model is pre-trained from scratch on PubMed abstracts using a consumer grade GPU with only 8GB memory. For biomedical named entity recognition, however, large BERT Base model outperforms both Bio-ELECTRA and ELECTRA-Small++.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInfection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes an acute illness termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Humoral immune responses likely play an important role in containing SARS-CoV-2, however, the determinants of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses are unclear.\n\nMethodsUsing immunoassays specific for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, we determined SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) in sera and mucosal fluids of two cohorts, including patients with quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 56; median age 61 years) with mild versus severe COVID-19, and SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthcare workers (n = 109; median age 36 years) with or without symptoms and tested negative or positive by RT-qPCR.\n\nFindingsOn average, SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA titers in mild COVID-19 cases became positive eight days after symptom onset and were often transient, whereas serum IgG levels remained negative or reached positive values 9-10 days after symptom onset. Conversely, patients with severe COVID-19 showed a highly significant increase of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA and IgG titers as a function of duration since symptom onset, independent of patient age and comorbidities. Very high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific serum IgA correlated with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Interestingly, some of the SARS-CoV-2-exposed healthcare workers with negative SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG serum titers had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA antibodies in their nasal fluids and tears. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA levels in nasal fluids of these healthcare workers were inversely correlated with patient age.\n\nInterpretationThese data show that systemic IgA and IgG production against SARS-CoV-2 develops mainly in severe COVID-19, with very high IgA levels seen in patients with severe ARDS, whereas mild disease may be associated with transient serum titers of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies but stimulate mucosal SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA secretion. The findings suggest four grades of antibody responses dependent on COVID-19 severity.",

While the elderly appear at high risk for severe disease, hospitalizations and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 among children have been relatively rare. Integrating single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of the developing mouse lung with temporally-resolved RNA-in-situ hybridization (ISH) in mouse and human lung tissue, we found that expression of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein primer TMPRSS2 was highest in ciliated cells and type I alveolar epithelial cells (AT1), and TMPRSS2 expression was increased with aging in mice and humans. Analysis of autopsy tissue from fatal COVID-19 cases revealed SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected most frequently in ciliated and secretory cells in the airway epithelium and AT1 cells in the peripheral lung. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was highly colocalized in cells expressing TMPRSS2. Together, these data demonstrate the cellular spectrum infected by SARS-CoV-2 in the lung epithelium, and suggest that developmental regulation of TMPRSS2 may underlie the relative protection of infants and children from severe respiratory illness.",

    "abstract": "Despite global investment in One Health disease surveillance, it remains difficult--and often very costly--to identify and monitor the wildlife reservoirs of novel zoonotic viruses. Statistical models can be used to guide sampling prioritization, but predictions from any given model may be highly uncertain; moreover, systematic model validation is rare, and the drivers of model performance are consequently under-documented. Here, we use bat hosts of betacoronaviruses as a case study for the data-driven process of comparing and validating predictive models of likely reservoir hosts. In the first quarter of 2020, we generated an ensemble of eight statistical models that predict host-virus associations and developed priority sampling recommendations for potential bat reservoirs and potential bridge hosts for SARS-CoV-2. Over more than a year, we tracked the discovery of 40 new bat hosts of betacoronaviruses, validated initial predictions, and dynamically updated our analytic pipeline. We find that ecological trait-based models perform extremely well at predicting these novel hosts, whereas network methods consistently perform roughly as well or worse than expected at random. These findings illustrate the importance of ensembling as a buffer against variation in model quality and highlight the value of including host ecology in predictive models. Our revised models show improved performance and predict over 400 bat species globally that could be undetected hosts of betacoronaviruses. Although 20 species of horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.) are known to be the primary reservoir of SARS-like viruses, we find at least three-fourths of plausible betacoronavirus reservoirs in this bat genus might still be undetected. Our study is the first to demonstrate through systematic validation that machine learning models can help optimize wildlife sampling for undiscovered viruses and illustrates how such approaches are best implemented through a dynamic process of prediction, data collection, validation, and updating.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease that manifests as joint damage and synovial inflammation. To date, most studies have focused on the decrease in cartilage stiffness, chondrocyte viability, and changes in matrix-degrading enzymes. With the exception of a few inflammatory cytokines and macrophages, the immune response in OA is poorly characterized, and the crosstalk of joint damage with T and B cells in local lymph nodes is unknown. Here, using an in vivo mouse model of mechanical loading of mouse tibia, we demonstrate that CD8+ T cells and subsets of CD4+ T cells, and not B cells, increase in the local lymph nodes and contribute to the progression of load-induced OA pathology. We demonstrate that T cell response is sex- and age-dependent. Mechanical loading of T cell knock-out mice that lack {beta} T cell receptor carrying cells resulted in attenuation of both cartilage degradation and osteophyte formation in loaded joints, with a concomitant increase in {gamma}{delta}+ T cells. Restricting the migration of T cells in lymphoid tissues through the systemic treatment using Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) inhibitor, decreased localization of T cells in synovium, and attenuated cartilage degradation. Our results lay the foundation of the role T cells play in the joint damage of load-induced OA and allude to the use of S1P inhibitors and T cell immunotherapies for slowing the progression of OA pathology.",

    "abstract": "Rapid generation of diagnostics is paramount to understand epidemiology and to control the spread of emerging infectious diseases such as COVID-19. Computational methods to predict serodiagnostic epitopes that are specific for the pathogen could help accelerate the development of new diagnostics. A systematic survey of 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins was conducted to assess whether existing B-cell epitope prediction methods, combined with comprehensive mining of sequence databases and structural data, could predict whether a particular protein would be suitable for serodiagnosis. Nine of the predictions were validated with recombinant SARS-CoV-2 proteins in the ELISA format using plasma and sera from patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a further 11 predictions were compared to the recent literature. Results appeared to be in agreement with 12 of the predictions, in disagreement with 3, while a further 5 were deemed inconclusive. We showed that two of our top five candidates, the N-terminal fragment of the nucleoprotein and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein, have the highest sensitivity and specificity and signal-to-noise ratio for detecting COVID-19 sera/plasma by ELISA. Mixing the two antigens together for coating ELISA plates led to a sensitivity of 94% (N=80 samples from persons with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection), and a specificity of 97.2% (N=106 control samples).",

    "abstract": "Accurate understanding of the global spread of emerging viruses is critically important for public health response and for anticipating and preventing future outbreaks. Here, we elucidate when, where and how the earliest sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission networks became established in Europe and the United States (US). Our results refute prior findings erroneously linking cases in January 2020 with outbreaks that occurred weeks later. Instead, rapid interventions successfully prevented onward transmission of those early cases in Germany and Washington State. Other, later introductions of the virus from China to both Italy and Washington State founded the earliest sustained European and US transmission networks. Our analyses reveal an extended period of missed opportunity when intensive testing and contact tracing could have prevented SARS-CoV-2 from becoming established in the US and Europe.",

    "abstract": "The world continues to face a life-threatening viral pandemic. The virus underlying the COVID-19 disease, SARS-CoV-2, has caused over 98 million confirmed cases and 2.2 million deaths since January 2020. Although the most recent respiratory viral pandemic swept the globe only a decade ago, the way science operates and responds to current events has experienced a paradigm shift in the interim. The scientific community has responded rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic, releasing over 125,000 COVID-19 related scientific articles within 10 months of the first confirmed case, of which more than 30,000 were hosted by preprint servers. We focused our analysis on bioRxiv and medRxiv, two growing preprint servers for biomedical research, investigating the attributes of COVID-19 preprints, their access and usage rates, as well as characteristics of their propagation on online platforms. Our data provides evidence for increased scientific and public engagement with preprints related to COVID-19 (COVID-19 preprints are accessed more, cited more, and shared more on various online platforms than non-COVID-19 preprints), as well as changes in the use of preprints by journalists and policymakers. We also find evidence for changes in preprinting and publishing behaviour: COVID-19 preprints are shorter and reviewed faster. Our results highlight the unprecedented role of preprints and preprint servers in the dissemination of COVID-19 science, and the impact of the pandemic on the scientific communication landscape.",

    "abstract": "Effective therapies for COVID-19 are urgently needed. Presently there are more than 800 COVID-19 clinical trials globally, many with drug combinations, resulting in an empirical process with an enormous number of possible combinations. To identify the most promising potential therapies, we developed a biophysical model for the SARS-CoV-2 viral cycle and performed a sensitivity analysis for individual model parameters and all possible pairwise parameter changes (162 = 256 possibilities). We found that model-predicted virion production is fairly insensitive to changes in most viral entry, assembly, and release parameters, but highly sensitive to some viral transcription and translation parameters. Furthermore, we found a cooperative benefit to pairwise targeting of transcription and translation, predicting that combined targeting of these processes will be especially effective in inhibiting viral production.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence places small proteins ([&le;] 50 amino acids) more centrally in physiological processes. Yet, the identification of functional small proteins and the systematic genome annotation of their cognate small open reading frames (smORFs) remains challenging both experimentally and computationally. Ribosome profiling or Ribo-Seq (that is a deep sequencing of ribosome-protected fragments) enables detecting of actively translated open-reading frames (ORFs) and empirical annotation of coding sequences (CDSs) using the in-register translation pattern that is characteristic for genuinely translating ribosomes. Multiple identifiers of ORFs that use 3-nt periodicity in Ribo-Seq data sets have been successful in eukaryotic smORF annotation. Yet, they have difficulties evaluating prokaryotic genomes due to the unique architecture of prokaryotic genomes (e.g. polycistronic messages, overlapping ORFs, leaderless translation, non-canonical initiation etc.). Here, we present our new algorithm, smORFer, which performs with high accuracy in prokaryotic organisms in detecting smORFs. The unique feature of smORFer is that it uses integrated approach and considers structural features of the genetic sequence along with in-register translation and uses Fourier transform to convert these parameters into a measurable score to faithfully select smORFs. The algorithm is executed in a modular way and dependent on the data available for a particular organism allows using different modules for smORF search.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial stringent stress response, mediated by the signaling molecule guanosine tetra-phosphate, ppGpp, has recently gained attention as being important during normal cellular growth and as potential new therapeutic target, which warrants detailed mechanistic understanding. Here, we used intracellular protein tracking in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, which indicated that RelA was bound to the ribosome, while SpoT localized at the cell poles. RNA-Seq was used to investigate the transcriptome of a ppGpp-deficient strain under non-stressful nutrient-rich broth conditions where the mutant grew at the same rate as the parent strain. In exponential growth phase, the lack of ppGpp led to >1,600 transcriptional changes (fold-change cut-off {+/-}1.5), providing further novel insights into the normal physiological role of ppGpp. The stringent response was linked to gene expression of various proteases and secretion systems including aprA, PA0277, impA, and clpP2. The previously observed reduction in cytotoxicity towards red blood cells, in a stringent response mutant, appeared to be due to aprA. Investigation of an aprA mutant in a murine skin infection model, showed increased survival rates of the aprA mutant consistent with previous observations that stringent-response mutants have reduced virulence. In addition, the overexpression of relA, but not induction of ppGpp with serine hydroxamate, dysregulated global transcriptional regulators as well as >30% of the regulatory networks controlled by AlgR, OxyR, LasR, and AmrZ. Together these data expand our knowledge about ppGpp and its regulatory network and role in environmental adaptation. It also confirms its important role throughout the normal growth cycle of bacteria.\n\nSignificance StatementMicroorganisms need to adapt rapidly to survive harsh environmental changes. Here, we showed the broad influence of the highly studied bacterial stringent stress response under non-stressful conditions that indicate its general physiological importance and might reflect the readiness of bacteria to respond to and activate acute stress responses. Using RNA-Seq to investigate the transcriptional network of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells revealed that >30% of all genes changed expression in a stringent-response mutant under optimal growth conditions. This included genes regulated by global transcriptional regulators and novel downstream effectors. Our results help to understand the importance of this stress regulator in bacterial lifestyle under relatively unstressed conditions. As such it draws attention to the consequences of targeting this ubiquitous bacterial signaling molecule.",

    "abstract": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful and debilitating condition of synovial joints without any disease-modifying therapies (1, 2). We previously identified mechanosensitive PIEZO channels, PIEZO1 and PIEZO2, both expressed in articular cartilage, to function in chondrocyte mechanotransduction in response to injury (3, 4). We therefore asked whether interleukin-1-mediated inflammatory signaling, as occurs in OA, influences Piezo gene expression and channel function, thus indicative of maladaptive reprogramming that can be rationally targeted. Primary porcine chondrocyte culture and human osteoarthritic cartilage tissue were studied.\n\nWe found that interleukin-1 (IL-1) upregulated Piezo1 in porcine chondrocytes. Piezo1 expression was significantly increased in human osteoarthritic cartilage. Increased Piezo1 expression in chondrocytes resulted in a feed-forward pathomechanism whereby increased function of Piezo1 induced excess intracellular Ca2+, at baseline and in response to mechanical deformation. Elevated resting state Ca2+ in turn rarefied the F-actin cytoskeleton and amplified mechanically-induced deformation-microtrauma. As intracellular substrates of this novel OA-related inflammatory pathomechanism, in porcine articular chondrocytes exposed to IL-1 we discovered that enhanced Piezo1 expression depended on p38 MAP-kinase and transcription factors HNF4 and ATF2/CREBP1. CREBP1 directly bound to the proximal PIEZO1 gene promoter.\n\nIn ensemble, these signaling and genetic re-programming events represent a novel and detrimental Ca2+-driven feed-forward mechanism that can be rationally targeted to stem the progression of OA.\n\nSignificance StatementOsteoarthritis affecting weight-bearing joints is a global health problem, causing loss of mobility and enormous healthcare costs. Disease-modifying approaches are lacking. Here, we report a new cellular mechanism of inflammatory signaling in chondrocytes, the cellular substrate of cartilage. We show how osteoarthritis-relevant levels of interleukin-1 reprogram articular chondrocytes so that they become more susceptible to mechanical trauma, which chondrocytes sense via Piezo1/2 mechanosensitive ion channels. We uncover that IL-1 enhances gene expression of Piezo1 in primary articular chondrocytes underlying Piezo1 gain-of-function. We elucidate the new signaling pathway, from membrane to nucleus, including transcription factors that enhance Piezo1-expression. We also define detrimental effects of gain-of-function of Piezo1, for mechanotransduction and at-rest, that suggest this new reprogramming mechanism to contribute to osteoarthritis pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic studies of anaerobic gut bacteria have been hindered by the lack of a fluorescent protein system to track and visualize proteins and dynamic cellular processes in actively growing bacteria. Although underappreciated, many gut \"anaerobes\" are able to respire using oxygen as the terminal electron acceptor. The oxygen continually released from gut epithelial cells creates an oxygen gradient from the mucus layer to the anaerobic lumen (1), with oxygen available to bacteria growing at the mucus layer. Using a combination of analyses, we show that Bacteroides species are metabolically and energetically robust and do not mount stress responses in the presence of 0.10 - 0.14% oxygen, defined as nanaerobic conditions (2). Taking advantage of this metabolic capability, we show that nanaerobic growth provides sufficient oxygen for the maturation of oxygen-requiring fluorescent proteins in Bacteroides species. Type strains of four different Bacteroides species show bright GFP fluorescence when grown nanaerobically versus anaerobically. We compared four different red fluorescent proteins and found that mKate2 yields high fluorescence intensity in our assay. We show that GFP-tagged proteins can be localized in nanaerobically growing bacteria. In addition, we used time-lapse fluorescence microscopy to image dynamic Type VI secretion system processes in metabolically active B. fragilis. The ability to visualize fluorescently-labeled Bacteroides and fluorescently-linked proteins in actively growing nanaerobic gut symbionts ushers in a new age of imaging analyses in these bacteria.\n\nSignificanceDespite many recent technological advances to study the human gut microbiota, we still lack a facile system to image dynamic cellular processes in most abundant gut species due to the requirement of oxygen for chromophore maturation of commonly used fluorescent proteins. Here, we took advantage of the ability of anaerobes of the gut microbiota to respire aerobically and grow robustly at 0.10- 0.14% oxygen. This physiologic concentration of oxygen is sufficient for fluorescent proteins to mature, allowing for visualization of biological processes never before imaged in these bacteria. This advance will allow for numerous types of analyses in actively-growing \"nanaerobic\" gut bacteria including subcellular protein localizations, single-cell analyses, biofilm imaging, and protein interactions with other microbes and the host.",

The additional strand conserved E (ASCE) ring motors are an ancient family of molecular motors responsible for diverse tasks ranging from biological polymer manipulation (e.g. protein degradation and chromosome segregation) to establishing and maintaining proton gradients across mitochondrial membranes. Viruses also utilize ASCE segregation motors to package their genomes into their protein capsids and serve as accessible experimental systems due to their relative simplicity. We show by CryoEM focused image reconstruction that ASCE ATPases in viral dsDNA packaging motors adopt helical symmetry complementary to their dsDNA substrates. Together with previous data, including structural results showing these ATPases in planar ring conformations, our results suggest that these motors cycle between helical and planar cyclical symmetry, providing a possible mechanism for directional translocation of DNA. We further note that similar changes in quaternary structure have been observed for proteasome and helicase motors, suggesting an ancient and common mechanism of force generation that has been adapted for specific tasks over the course of evolution.",

    "abstract": "The generation of in vitro model of human peripheral myelin development and associated disease from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) has been a challenge so far. In addition, the underlying mechanism for ZIKA virus (ZIKV) infection incurred Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) remains unexplored due to the lack of a suitable model. Here, we report the de novo generation of a human peripheral myelination model with competent Schwann cells (SCs). Those human SCs generated from hPSCs via compound screening were capable of forming compact myelin both in vitro and in vivo. We found ZIKV infection caused GBS-like events in vitro including myelin sheath degeneration, as well as dysregulated transcriptional profile including the activated cell death pathways and cytokine production. These effects could be partially reversed by several pharmacological inhibitors. Our model therefore provides a new and robust tool for studying the pathogenic mechanisms and developing of therapeutic strategies for related neuropathies.",

    "abstract": "The precise execution of mitotic spindle orientation in response to cell shape cues is important for tissue organization and development. The presence of astral microtubules extending from the centrosome towards the cell cortex is essential for this process, but little is understood about the contribution of astral microtubule dynamics to spindle positioning, or how astral microtubule dynamics are regulated spatiotemporally. The mitotic regulator Cdk1-CyclinB promotes destabilization of centrosomal microtubules and increased microtubule dynamics as cells transition from interphase to mitosis, but how Cdk1 activity specifically modulates astral microtubule stability, and whether it impacts spindle positioning, is unknown. Here we uncover a mechanism revealing that Cdk1 destabilizes astral microtubules to ensure spindle reorientation in response to cell shape. Phosphorylation of the EB1-dependent microtubule plus-end tracking protein GTSE1 by Cdk1 in early mitosis abolishes its interaction with EB1 and recruitment to microtubule plus-ends. Loss of Cdk1 activity, or mutation of phosphorylation sites in GTSE1, induces recruitment of GTSE1 to growing microtubule plus-ends in mitosis. This decreases the catastrophe frequency of astral microtubules, and causes an increase in the number of long astral microtubules reaching the cell cortex, which restrains the ability of cells to reorient spindles along the long cellular axis in early mitosis. Astral microtubules must thus not only be present, but also dynamic to allow the spindle to reorient in response to cell shape, a state achieved by selective destabilization of long astral microtubules via Cdk1.",

    "abstract": "Condensins are essential for global chromosome organization in diverse bacteria. Atypically, Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes condensins from two superfamilies, SMC-ScpAB and MksBEF. We report that the two proteins play specialized roles in chromosome packing and segregation and are synthetically lethal with ParB. Inactivation of SMC or MksB asymmetrically affected global chromosome layout, its timing of segregation and sometimes triggered a chromosomal inversion. Localization pattern was also unique to each protein. SMC clusters colocalized with oriC throughout cell cycle except shortly after origin duplication, whereas MksB clusters emerged at cell quarters shortly prior to oriC duplication and stayed there even after cell division. Relocation of the proteins was abrupt and coordinated with oriC dynamic. These data reveal that the two condensins asymmetrically play dual roles in chromosome maintenance by organizing it and mediating its segregation. Furthermore, the choreography of condensins and oriC relocations suggest an elegant mechanism for the birth and maturation of chromosomes.\n\nImportanceMechanisms that define the chromosome as a structural entity remain unknown. A key element in this process are condensins, which globally organize chromosomes and contribute to their segregation. This study characterized condensin and chromosome dynamics in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which harbors condensins from two major protein superfamilies, SMC and MksBEF. The study revealed that both proteins asymmetrically play a dual role in chromosome maintenance by spatially organizing the chromosomes and guiding their segregation but can substitute for each other in some activities. The timing of chromosome, SMC and MksBEF relocation was highly ordered and interdependent revealing causative relationships in the process. Moreover, MksBEF was found to produce clusters at the site of chromosome replication that survived cell division and remained in place until chromosome replication was complete. Overall, these data delineate the functions of condensins from the SMC MksBEF superfamilies, reveal the existence of a chromosome organizing center and suggest a mechanism that might explain the biogenesis of chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "Signaling through retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) like receptors (RLRs) is tightly regulated, with activation occurring upon sensing of viral nucleic acids, and suppression mediated by negative regulators. Under homeostatic conditions aberrant activation of melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5 (MDA5) is prevented through editing of endogenous dsRNA by RNA editing enzyme Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA (ADAR1). In addition, ADAR1 is postulated to play proviral and antiviral roles during viral infections that are dependent or independent of RNA editing activity. Here, we investigated the importance of ADAR1 isoforms in modulating influenza A virus (IAV) replication and revealed the opposing roles for ADAR1 isoforms, with the nuclear p110 isoform restricting versus the cytoplasmic p150 isoform promoting IAV replication. Importantly, we demonstrate that p150 is critical for preventing sustained RIG-I signaling, as p150 deficient cells showed increased IFN-{beta} expression and apoptosis during IAV infection, independent of RNA editing activity. Taken together, the p150 isoform of ADAR1 is important for preventing sustained RIG-I induced IFN-{beta} expression and apoptosis during viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Influenza and other respiratory viruses represent a significant threat to public health, national security, and the world economy, and can lead to the emergence of global pandemics such as the current COVID-19 crisis. One of the greatest barriers to the development of effective therapeutic agents to treat influenza, coronaviruses, and many other infections of the respiratory tract is the absence of a robust preclinical model. Preclinical studies currently rely on high-throughput, low-fidelity in vitro screening with cell lines and/or low-throughput animal models that often provide a poor correlation to human clinical responses. Here, we introduce a human primary airway epithelial cell-based model integrated into a high-throughput platform where tissues are cultured at an air-liquid interface (PREDICT96-ALI). We present results on the application of this platform to influenza and coronavirus infections, providing multiple readouts capable of evaluating viral infection kinetics and potentially the efficacy of therapeutic agents in an in vitro system. Several strains of influenza A virus are shown to successfully infect the human primary cell-based airway tissue cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI), and as a proof-of-concept, the effect of the antiviral oseltamivir on one strain of Influenza A is evaluated. Human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and SARS-CoV-2 enter host cells via ACE2 and utilize the protease TMPRSS2 for protein priming, and we confirm expression of both in our ALI model. We also demonstrate coronavirus infection in this system with HCoV-NL63, observing sufficient viral propagation over 96 hours post-infection to indicate successful infection of the primary cell-based model. This new capability has the potential to address a gap in the rapid assessment of therapeutic efficacy of various small molecules and antiviral agents against influenza and other respiratory viruses including coronaviruses.",
