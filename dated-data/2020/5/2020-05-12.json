    "abstract": "Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major staple crop in East Africa (EA) providing 9% and 10% of daily calories and protein intake, respectively. However, EA countries depend on import to meet 55% of their domestic wheat supplies due to increasing demands and low domestic yields. To determine the beneficial gene pool currently exploited for wheat improvement in EA, we examined the allelic diversity of 42 genes of breeding importance in a collection of 239 wheat cultivars and breeding lines from Kenya and Ethiopia using KASP markers. The assayed genes have been shown to control variations in plant height, thousand kernel weight (TKW), grain protein content, pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), disease resistance and flowering time. We observed the beneficial alleles of some major genes including Rht-D1, Gpc-B1, Yr5, Yr15, Sr26, and Fhb1 to be missing or present at low frequencies in this population. Furthermore, we validated the effects of the major Rht-1 alleles and TaCKX-6A in controlling variation in plant height and thousand kernel weight, respectively, under EA conditions. Our results uncover hitherto unexploited allelic diversity that can be used to improve the genetic potential of EA wheat germplasm. This will inform strategies to rapidly mobilize these beneficial alleles for wheat improvement in EA.",

    "abstract": "Precision genomic alterations largely rely on Homology Directed Repair (HDR), but targeting without homology using the Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) pathway has gained attention as a promising alternative. Previous studies demonstrated precise insertions formed by the ligation of donor DNA into a targeted genomic double strand break in both dividing and non-dividing cells. Here we extend this idea and use NHEJ repair to replace genomic segments with donor sequences; we name this method  Replace editing (Rational end-joining protocol delivering a targeted sequence exchange). Using CRISPR/Cas9 we create two genomic breaks and ligate a donor sequence in-between. This exchange of a genomic for a donor sequence uses neither microhomology nor homology arms. We target four loci and show successful exchange of exons in 16% to 54% of cells. Using linear amplification methods and deep sequencing pipelines we quantify the diversity of outcomes following Replace editing and profile mutations formed at the ligated interfaces. The ability to replace exons or other genomic sequences in cells not efficiently modified by HDR holds promise for both basic research and medicine.",

    "abstract": "Where is human language processed in the brain independent of its form? We addressed this issue by analyzing the cortical responses to spoken, written and signed sentences at the level of individual subjects. By applying a novel fingerprinting method based on the distributed pattern of brain activity, we identified a left-lateralized network composed by the superior temporal gyrus/sulcus (STG/STS), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), precentral gyrus/sulcus (PCG/PCS), and supplementary motor area (SMA). In these regions, the local distributed activity pattern induced by any of the three language modalities can predict the activity pattern induced by the other two modalities, and such cross-modal prediction is individual-specific. The prediction is successful for speech-sign bilinguals across all possible modality pairs, but fails for monolinguals across sign-involved pairs. In comparison, conventional group-mean focused analysis detects shared cortical activations across modalities only in the STG, PCG/PCS and SMA, and the shared activations were found in two groups. This study reveals the core language system in the brain that is shared by spoken, written and signed language, and demonstrates that it is possible and desirable to utilize the information of individual differences for functional brain mapping.",

    "abstract": "Using neuroimaging, we studied influence of family cultural background on processing of an audiobook in human brain. The audiobook depicted life of two young Finnish men, one with the Finnish and the other with the Russian family background. Shared family cultural background enhanced similarity of narrative processing in the brain at prelexical, word, sentence, and narrative levels. Similarity was also enhanced in brain areas supporting imagery. The cultural background was further reflected as semantic differences in word lists by which the subjects described what had been on their minds when they heard the audiobook during neuroimaging. Strength of social identity shaped word, sentence, and narrative level processing in the brain. These effects might enhance mutual understanding between persons who share family cultural background and social identity and, conversely, deteriorate between-group mutual understanding in modern multicultural societies wherein native speakers of a language may assume highly similar understanding.",

    "abstract": "Deregulated alternative splicing has been implicated in a wide range of pathologies. Deep RNA-sequencing has revealed global mis-splicing signatures in multiple human diseases; however, for neurodegenerative diseases, these analyses are intrinsically hampered by neuronal loss and neuroinflammation in post-mortem brains. To infer splicing alterations relevant to Huntingtons disease (HD) pathogenesis, here we performed intersect-RNA-seq analyses of human post-mortem striatal tissue and of an early symptomatic mouse model in which neuronal loss and gliosis are not yet present. Together with a human/mouse parallel motif scan analysis, this approach allowed us to identify the shared mis-splicing signature triggered by the HD-causing mutation in both species and to infer upstream deregulated splicing factors. Moreover, we identified a plethora of downstream neurodegeneration-linked effector genes, whose aberrant splicing is associated with decreased protein levels in HD patients and mice. In summary, our intersect-RNA-seq approach unveiled the pathogenic contribution of mis-splicing to HD and could be readily applied to other neurodegenerative diseases for which bona fide animal models are available.",

    "abstract": "PREMISELeaf shape and size figure strongly in trees adaptation to their environments. Oaks are notoriously variable in leaf morphology. Our study examines the degree to which within-tree, among-tree, and among-site variation contribute to latitudinal variation in leaf shape and size of bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa: Fagaceae), one of North Americas most geographically widespread oak species.\n\nMETHODSSamples were collected from four sites each at northern, central, and southern latitudes of the bur oak range. Ten leaf size traits were measured, and variance in these traits and eight ratios based on these traits was partitioned into tree, population, and latitude components. We then parameterized a series of leaf collection simulations using empirical covariance among leaves on trees and trees at sites. We used the simulations to assess the efficiency of different collecting strategies for estimating among-population differences in leaf shape and size.\n\nKEY RESULTSLeaf size measurements were highly responsive to latitude. Site contributed more than tree to total variation in leaf morphology. Simulations suggest that power to detect among-site variance in leaf shape and size can be estimated most efficiently with increases in either leaves per tree (10-11 leaves from each of 5 trees) or trees per site (5 leaves from each of 10+ trees).\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur study demonstrates the utility of simulating sampling and controlling for variance in sampling for leaf morphology, whether the questions being addressed are ecological, evolutionary, or taxonomic.

    "abstract": "The processing of microscopy images constitutes a bottleneck for large-scale experiments. A critical step is the establishment of cell borders ( segmentation), which is required for a range of applications such as growth or fluorescent reporter measurements. For the model organism budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), a number of methods for segmentation exist. However, in experiments involving multiple cell cycles, stress, or various mutants, cells crowd or exhibit irregular visible features, which necessitate frequent manual corrections. Furthermore, budding events are visually subtle but important to detect. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully employed for a range of image processing applications. They require large, diverse training sets. Here, we present i) the first set of publicly available, high-quality segmented yeast images (>10000 cells) including mutants, stressed cells, and time courses, ii) a corresponding U-Net-based CNN, iii) a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) to efficiently use the system, and iv) a web application to test it (www.quantsysbio.com). A key feature is a cell-cell boundary test which avoids the need for additional input from fluorescent channels. A bipartite graph matching algorithm tracks cells in time with high reliability. Our network is highly accurate and outperforms existing methods on benchmark images recorded by others, suggesting it transfers well to other conditions. Furthermore, new buds are detected early with high reliability. We apply the system to detect differences in geometry between wild-type and cyclin mutant cells. Our results indicate that morphogenesis control occurs unexpectedly early in the cell cycle and is gradual, demonstrating how the efficient processing of large numbers of cells uncovers new biology. Our system can serve as a resource to the community, expanded continuously with new images.

    "abstract": "BackgroundInsertion and deletion sequencing errors are relatively common in next-generation sequencing data and produce long stretches of mistranslated sequence. These frameshifting errors can cause very serious damages to downstream data analysis of reads. However, it is possible to obtain more precise alignment of DNA sequences by taking into account both coding frame and sequencing errors estimated by quality scores.\n\nResultsHere we designed and proposed a novel hidden Markov model (HMM)-based pairwise alignment algorithm, Meta-Align, that aligns DNA sequences in the protein space, incorporating quality scores from the DNA sequences and allowing frameshifts caused by insertions and deletions. Our model is based on both an HMM transducer of a pair HMM and profile HMMs for all possible amino acid pairs. A Viterbi algorithm over our model produces the optimal alignment of a pair of metagenomic reads taking into account all possible translating frames and gap penalties in both the protein space and the DNA space. To reduce the sheer number of states of this model, we also derived and implemented a computationally feasible model, leveraging the degeneracy of the genetic code. In a benchmark test on a diverse set of simulated reads based on BAliBASE we show that Meta-Align outperforms TBLASTX which compares the six-frame translations of a nucleotide query sequence against the six-frame translations of a nucleotide sequence database using the BLAST algorithm. We also demonstrate the effects of incorporating quality scores on Meta-Align.\n\nConclusionsMeta-Align will be particularly effective when applied to error-prone DNA sequences.

    "abstract": "Estimating animal home ranges is a primary purpose of collecting tracking data. All conventional home range estimators in widespread usage, including minimum convex polygons and kernel density estimators, assume independently sampled data. In stark contrast, modern GPS animal tracking datasets are almost always strongly autocorrelated. This incongruence between estimator assumptions and empirical reality leads to systematically underestimated home ranges. Autocorrelated kernel density estimation (AKDE) resolves this conflict by modeling the observed autocorrelation structure of tracking data during home range estimation, and has been shown to perform accurately across a broad range of tracking datasets. However, compared to conventional estimators, AKDE requires additional modeling steps and has heretofore only been accessible via the command-line ctmm R package. Here, we introduce ctmmweb, which provides a point-and-click graphical interface to ctmm, and streamlines AKDE, its prerequisite autocorrelation modeling steps, and a number of additional movement analyses. We demonstrate ctmmwebs capabilities, including AKDE home range estimation and subsequent home range overlap analysis, on a dataset of four jaguars from the Brazilian Pantanal. We intend ctmmweb to open AKDE and related autocorrelation-explicit analyses to a wider audience of wildlife and conservation professionals.",

    "abstract": "Can alterations in experience trigger different plastic modifications in neuronal structure and function, and if so, how do they integrate at the cellular level? To address this question, we interrogated circuitry in the mouse olfactory bulb responsible for the earliest steps in odour processing. We induced experience-dependent plasticity in mice by blocking one nostril for a day, a minimally-invasive manipulation which leaves the sensory organ undamaged and is akin to the natural transient blockage suffered during common mild rhinal infections. We found that such brief sensory deprivation produced structural and functional plasticity in one highly specialised bulbar cell type: axon-bearing dopaminergic neurons in the glomerular layer. After 24h naris occlusion, the axon initial segment (AIS) in bulbar dopaminergic neurons became significantly shorter, a structural modification that was also associated with a decrease in intrinsic excitability. These effects were specific to the AIS-positive dopaminergic subpopulation, because no experience-dependent alterations in intrinsic excitability were observed in AIS-negative dopaminergic cells. Moreover, 24h naris occlusion produced no structural changes at the AIS of bulbar excitatory neurons - mitral/tufted and external tufted cells - nor did it alter their intrinsic excitability. By targeting excitability in one specialised dopaminergic subpopulation, experience-dependent plasticity in early olfactory networks might act to fine-tune sensory processing in the face of continually fluctuating inputs.",

One hundred one healthy young adults viewed 48 unique episodes of visual events and were later tested on recall of the order of events (chronological time) and the precise timing of events (metric time). The behavioral results show that metric recall accuracy correlates with chronological accuracy for events within episodes, but does not play a role on larger time-scales across episodes. Functional magnetic resonance imaging during encoding and recall showed that metric time was represented in the posterior medial entorhinal cortex, as well as the temporal pole and the cerebellum, whereas chronological time was represented in a widespread brain network including the anterior lateral entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal cortex and the prefrontal cortex. We conclude that metric time has a role in episodic memory on short time-scales and is mainly subserved by medial temporal lobe structures.",

Using layer-specific, cell-selective DREADD transductions, we examined the involvement of somatostatin- (SOM-INs) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP-INs)-containing interneurons in the development of learning-related plastic changes. We injected DREADD-expressing vectors into layer IV (L4) barrels or layer II/III (L2/3) areas corresponding to activated vibrissae. The activity of interneurons was modulated during training, and 2DG maps were obtained 24 h later. In mice with L4 but not L2/3 SOM-INs suppressed during conditioning, the plastic change of whisker representation and the conditioned reaction were absent. No effect of inhibiting VIP-INs was found. We report that the activity of L4 SOM-INs is indispensable for learning-induced plastic change.",

    "abstract": "Plants recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to activate PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). However, our knowledge of PTI signaling remains limited. In this report, we introduce Lumi-Map, a high-throughput platform for identifying causative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to studying PTI signaling components. In Lumi-Map, a transgenic reporter plant line is produced that contains a firefly luciferase (LUC) gene driven by a defense gene promoter, which generates luminescence upon PAMP treatment. The line is mutagenized and the mutants with altered luminescence patterns are screened by a high-throughput real-time bioluminescence monitoring system. Selected mutants are subjected to MutMap analysis, a whole genome sequencing (WGS)-based method of rapid mutation identification, to identify the causative SNP responsible for the luminescence pattern change. We generated nine transgenic Arabidopsis reporter lines expressing LUC gene fused to multiple promoter sequences of defense-related genes. These lines generate luminescence upon activation of FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) by flg22, a PAMP derived from bacterial flagellin. We selected the WRKY29-promoter reporter line to identify mutants in the signaling pathway downstream of FLS2. After screening 24,000 ethylmethanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutants of the reporter line, we isolated 22 mutants with altered WRKY29 expression upon flg22 treatment (abbreviated as awf mutants). While five flg22-insensitive awf mutants harbored mutations in FLS2 itself, Lumi-Map revealed three genes not previously associated with PTI. Lumi-Map has the potential to identify novel PAMPs and their receptors as well as signaling components downstream of the receptors.",

    "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a worldwide hematological disorder causing painful episodes, anemia, organ damage, stroke, and even deaths. It is more common in sub-Saharan Africa and other resource-limited countries. Conventional laboratory-based diagnostic methods for SCD are time-consuming, complex, and cannot be performed at point-of-care (POC) and home settings. Optical microscope-based classification and counting demands a significant amount of time, extensive setup, and cost along with the skilled human labor to distinguish the normal red blood cells (RBCs) from sickled cells. There is an unmet need to develop a POC and home-based test to diagnose and monitor SCD and reduce mortality in resource-limited settings. An early-stage and timely diagnosis of SCD can help in the effective management of the disease. In this article, we utilized a smartphone-based image acquisition method for capturing RBC images from the SCD patients in normoxia and hypoxia conditions. A computer algorithm is developed to differentiate RBCs from the patients blood before and after cell sickling. Using the developed smartphone-based technique, we obtained similar percentage of sickle cells in blood samples as analyzed by conventional method (standard microscope). The developed method of testing demonstrates the potential utility of the smartphone-based test for reducing the overall cost of screening and management for SCD, thus increasing the practicality of smartphone-based screening technique for SCD in low-resource settings. Our setup does not require any special storage requirements and is particularly useful in assessing the severity of the SCD. This is the characteristic advantage of our technique as compared to other hemoglobin-based POC diagnostic techniques.",

    "abstract": "Identifying drug-target interactions (DTIs) is an important step for drug discovery and drug repositioning. To reduce heavily experiment cost, booming machine learning has been applied to this field and developed many computational methods, especially binary classification methods. However, there is still much room for improvement in the performance of current methods. Multi-label learning can reduce difficulties faced by binary classification learning with high predictive performance, and has not been explored extensively. The key challenge it faces is the exponential-sized output space, and considering label correlations can help it. Thus, we facilitate the multi-label classification by introducing community detection methods for DTIs prediction, named DTI-MLCD. On the other hand, we updated the gold standard data set proposed in 2008 and still in use today. The proposed DTI-MLCD is performed on the gold standard data set before and after the update, and shows the superiority than other classical machine learning methods and other benchmark proposed methods, which confirms the efficiency of it.

    "abstract": "Wearable Health Devices (WHDs) benefit people to monitor their health status and have become a necessity in todays world. The smart shoe is the type of WHD, that provides comfort, convenience, and fitness tracking. Hence smart shoes can be considered as one of the most useful innovations in the field of wearable devices. In this paper, we propose a unique system, in which the smart shoes are capable of energy harvesting when the user is walking, running, dancing, or carrying out any other similar activities. This generated power can be used to charge portable devices (like mobile) and to light up the LED torch. It also has Wi-Fi-that allows it to get connected to smartphones or any device on a cloud. The recorded data was used to determine the walking pattern of the user (gait analysis) using deep learning. The overall classification accuracy obtained with proposed smart shoes could reach up to 96.2 %. This gait analysis can be further used for detecting any injury or disorder that the shoe user is suffering from. One more unique feature of the proposed smart shoe is its capability of adjusting the size by using inflatable technology as per the users comfort.",

    "abstract": "2'-O-methylation (2'O) is one of the abundant post-transcriptional RNA modifications which can be found in all types of RNA. Detection and functional analysis of 2'O methylation have become challenging problems for biologists ever since its discovery. This paper addresses computational challenges for building Machine Learning and Deep Learning models for predicting 2'O sites. In particular, the impact of sequence length containing 2'O site, embedding method and the type of predictive model are each investigated separately. 30 different predictive models are built and each showed the impact of the mentioned parameters. The area under the precision-recall and receiving operating characteristics curves are utilized to test imbalanced case scenarios in the real world. By comparing the performance of these models, it is shown that embedding methods are crucial for Machine Learning models. However, they do not improve the performance of Deep Learning models. Furthermore, the best predictive model was further investigated to extract significant nucleotides surrounding 2'O sites. Interestingly, based on the significant score matrix achieved by all 2'O samples, it is depicted that model pays the highest attention at the location that the dominant 2'O motifs exist.

    "abstract": "There is no satisfactory explanation for why peacock possesses a tail, presence and especially courtship display of which makes the organism vulnerable to predation. Here, I present a model according to which in a polygynous mating system a mechanism which increases vulnerability to predation, a Zahavian handicap, evolves when other two mechanisms to identify high-quality males are either absent or are not sufficiently strong. The two mechanisms are: 1) male resource acquisition ability, and 2) male-male competition for females. The three mechanisms are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Assuming the locus for the tail and choosiness to be sex-specific, it is shown through stochastic simulation that sexual selection, mediated by the tail (a Zahavian handicap), leads to higher rate of increase in the quality of the population of tailed peacocks and tailed-choosy peahens (which exclusively mate with tailed peacocks) as compared to the population of tailless peacocks and tailless-choosy peahens (which exclusively mate with tailless peacocks), through a positive feedback, as daughters of tailed-choosy peahens are of higher average quality and, by virtue of not carrying the tails handicap, also fitness than daughters of tailless-choosy peahens. Also, the fold-change in the population of tailed peacocks and tailless-choosy peahens are higher than the fold-change in the population of tailless peacocks and tailless-choosy peahens, for all combinations of the initial conditions. The same results were got, though in milder form, when tailless-choosy peahens were replaced by undiscriminating peahens (which mate with tailless and tailed peacocks in proportion to their frequencies in the population). Although sons of tailed-choosy peahens have lower average fitness than sons of undiscriminating peahens, this difference is inconsequential, because in a polygynous mating system a single male can potentially mate with every female. The work presented here reconciles Zahavis handicap principle with Darwins theories of natural and sexual selection. Further, it is hypothesized that a genotype responsible for producing in males a reliable indicator of high quality (a Zahavian handicap) or paternal care ability generates mating desirability in females towards males possessing the indicator. It is demonstrated through simulation that this cross-gender pleiotropy expedites the evolution of tailed peacocks and tailed-choosy peahens and leads to higher rate of increase in their quality.",

In the present study, transgenic lines of the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were generated to overexpress either wild type CrOR (CrORWT) or a mutated CrOR (CrORHis) containing a single histidine substitution for a conserved arginine. Overexpression of both CrORWT and CrORHis dramatically enhanced the accumulation of several different carotenoids, including {beta}-cartotene, -carotene, lutein and violaxanthin, in C. reinhardtii and, in contrast to higher plants, upregulated the transcript abundance of several relevant carotenoid biosynthetic genes. In addition, microscopic analysis revealed that the OR transgenic cells were larger than control cells and exhibited larger chloroplasts with a disrupted morphology. Moreover, both CrORWT and CrORHis cell lines showed increased tolerance to salt and paraquat stress. The levels of endogenous phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) were also increased in CrORWT and CrORHis lines, not only in normal growth conditions but also in growth medium supplemented with paraquat. Together these results offer new insights regarding the role of the OR protein in regulating carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation in microalgae, and establish a new functional role for OR to modulate oxidative stress tolerance mediated by ABA.",

Literature survey demonstrated that it has many pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiviral, anticancer and wound healing. The present study was aimed to understand if major phytocompounds of Rheum emodi could bind proteins responsible for antibiotic resistance in bacterial and fungal pathogens and enhance the potency of antibiotics. The major phytocompounds of R. emodi (emodin, rhein-13c6 and chrysophenodimethy ether) were retrieved from Pubchem and target proteins were retrieved from RCSB protein data bank. The docking study was performed with Hex 8.0.0 software and molinspiration, swiss ADME servers were used for determination of Lipinski rule of 5, drug-likeness prediction respectively, whereas, admetSAR and Protox-II tools were used for toxicity prediction. Among all the selected phytocompounds, emodin showed the best binding energy of -235.82 Kcal mol-1 and -245 Kcal mol-1 with cytochrome P450 14 alpha-sterol demethylase (PDB ID: 1EA1) and N-myristoyl transferase (PDB ID: 1IYL) receptors, respectively, which is more than that of fluconazole (-224.12 kcalmol-1 and -161.14 kcal mol-1). Similarly, with Penicillin binding protein 3 (PDB ID: 3VSL) receptor, emodin and Chrysophanol dimethyl ether showed highest binding energy of - 216.68 Kcal mol-1 and -215.58 kcal mol-1 which is comparable to erythromycin (-263.63 kcal mol-1), chloramphanicol (-217.34 kcal mol-1) and tetracycline (-263.63 kcal mol-1). All the selected phytocompounds also fulfill Lipinski rule, non-carcinogenic and non-cytotoxic in nature.

Lower grade mIDH1 gliomas are classified into two molecular subgroups: (i) 1p/19q co-deletion/TERT-promoter mutations or (ii) inactivating mutations in -thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) and TP53. This work, relates to the gliomas subtype harboring mIDH1, TP53 and ATRX inactivation. IDH1-R132H is a gain-of-function mutation that converts -ketoglutarate into 2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). The role of D-2HG within the tumor microenvironment of mIDH1/mATRX/mTP53 gliomas remains unexplored. Inhibition of 2HG, when used as monotherapy or in combination with radiation and temozolomide (IR/TMZ), led to increased median survival (MS) of mIDH1 glioma bearing mice. Also, 2HG inhibition elicited anti-mIDH1 glioma immunological memory. In response to 2HG inhibition, PD-L1 expression levels on mIDH1-glioma cells increased to similar levels as observed in wild-type-IDH1 gliomas. Thus, we combined 2HG inhibition/IR/TMZ with anti-PDL1 immune checkpoint-blockade and observed complete tumor regression in 60% of mIDH1 glioma bearing mice. This combination strategy reduced T-cell exhaustion and favored the generation of memory CD8+T-cells. Our findings demonstrate that metabolic reprogramming elicits anti-mIDH1 glioma immunity, leading to increased MS and immunological memory.

    "abstract": "Optimal attention performance requires cholinergic modulation of corticothalamic neurons in the prefrontal cortex. These pyramidal cells express specialized nicotinic acetylcholine receptors containing the 5 subunit encoded by Chrna5. Disruption of this gene impairs attention, but the advantage 5 confers for the detection of endogenous cholinergic signaling is unknown. To ascertain this underlying mechanism, we used optogenetics to stimulate cholinergic afferents in prefrontal cortex brain slices from compound-transgenic wild-type and Chrna5 knockout mice of both sexes. These electrophysiological experiments identify that Chrna5 is critical for the rapid onset of the postsynaptic cholinergic response. Loss of 5 slows cholinergic excitation and delays its peak, and these effects are observed in two different optogenetic mouse lines. Disruption of Chrna5 does not otherwise perturb the magnitude of the response, which remains strongly mediated by nicotinic receptors and tightly controlled by autoinhibition via muscarinic M2 receptors. However, when conditions are altered to promote sustained cholinergic receptor stimulation, it becomes evident that 5 also works to protect nicotinic responses against desensitization. Rescuing Chrna5 disruption thus presents the double challenge of improving the onset of cholinergic signaling without triggering desensitization. Here, we identify that an agonist for the unorthodox - nicotinic binding site can allosterically enhance this cholinergic pathway considered vital for attention. Minimal NS9283 treatment restores the rapid onset of the postsynaptic cholinergic response without triggering desensitization. Taken together, this work demonstrates the advantages of speed and resilience that Chrna5 confers on endogenous cholinergic signaling, defining a critical window of interest for cue detection and attentional processing.\n\nSignificance statementThe 5 nicotinic receptor subunit (Chrna5) is important for attention, but its advantage in detecting endogenous cholinergic signals is unknown. Here, we show that 5 subunits permit rapid cholinergic responses in prefrontal cortex and protect these responses from desensitization. Our findings clarify why Chrna5 is required for optimal attentional performance under demanding conditions. To treat the deficit arising from Chrna5 disruption without triggering desensitization, we enhanced nicotinic receptor affinity using NS9283 stimulation at the unorthodox - nicotinic binding site. This approach successfully restored the rapid-onset kinetics of endogenous cholinergic neurotransmission. In summary, we reveal a previously unknown role of Chrna5 as well as an effective approach to compensate for genetic disruption and permit fast cholinergic excitation of prefrontal attention circuits.",

    "abstract": "Idiopathic generalized epilepsy(IGE) patients have genetic causes and their seizure onset mechanisms particularly during sleep remain elusive. Here we proposed that sleep-like slow-wave oscillations(0.5 Hz SWOs) potentiated excitatory or inhibitory synaptic currents in layer V cortical pyramidal neurons from wild-type(wt) mouse ex vivo brain slices. In contrast, SWOs potentiated excitatory, not inhibitory, currents in cortical neurons from heterozygous(het) knock-in(KI) IGE mice(GABAA receptor {gamma}2 subunit Gabrg2Q390X mutation), creating an imbalance between evoked excitatory and inhibitory currents to effectively prompt neuronal action potentials. Similarly, more physiologically similar up/down-state(present during slow-wave sleep) induction in cortical neurons could potentiate excitatory synaptic currents within slices from wt/het Gabrg2Q390X KI mice. Consequently, SWOs or up/down-state induction in vivo (using optogenetic method) could trigger epileptic spike-wave discharges(SWDs) in het Gabrg2Q390X KI mice. To our knowledge, this is the first operative mechanism to explain why epileptic SWDs preferentially happen during non-REM sleep or quiet-wakefulness in human IGE patients.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-R) have been identified as key bio-markers of important brain functions such as memory consolidation and decision making. SPW-R detection typically relies on hand-crafted feature extraction, and laborious manual curation is often required. In this multidisciplinary study, we propose a novel, self-improving artificial intelligence (AI) method in the form of deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) layers that can learn features of SPW-R events from raw, labeled input data. The algorithm is trained using supervised learning on hand-curated data sets with SPW-R events. The input to the algorithm is the local field potential (LFP), the low-frequency part of extracellularly recorded electric potentials from the CA1 region of the hippocampus. The output prediction can be interpreted as the time-varying probability of SPW-R events for the duration of the input. A simple thresholding applied to the output probabilities is found to identify times of events with high precision. The reference implementation of the algorithm, named  RippleNet, is open source, freely available, and implemented using a common open-source framework for neural networks (tensorflow.keras) and can be easily incorporated into existing data analysis workflows for processing experimental data.",

    "abstract": "The reversibility of ubiquitination by the action of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) serves as an important regulatory layer within the ubiquitin system. Approximately 100 DUBs are encoded by the human genome and many have been implicated with pathologies including neurodegeneration and cancer. Non-lysine ubiquitination is chemically distinct and its physiological importance is emerging. Here we couple chemically and chemoenzymatically synthesized ubiquitinated lysine and threonine model substrates to a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry-based DUB assay. Using this platform, we profile two-thirds of known catalytically active DUBs for threonine esterase and lysine isopeptidase activity and find that most DUBs demonstrate dual selectivity. However, with two anomalous exceptions, the ovarian tumor domain (OTU) DUB class demonstrate specific (iso)peptidase activity. Strikingly, we find the Machado Josephin Domain (MJD) class to be unappreciated non-lysine DUBs with highly specific ubiquitin esterase activity that rivals the efficiency of the most active isopeptidases. Esterase activity is dependent on the canonical catalytic triad but proximal hydrophobic residues appear to be general determinants of non-lysine activity. These findings suggest that non-lysine ubiquitination is an integral component of the ubiquitin system, with regulatory sophistication comparable to that of canonical ubiquitination.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization reports that cancer is one of the most common causes of death worldwide and it accounted for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. As compared with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, immunotherapy offers a safer, less stressful and selective strategy in the destruction of cancer cells. The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DS2 (KIR2DS2) expressed on Natural Killer (NK) cells are involved in signal transduction processes that produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and directly destroy cancer and virally infected cells. The aim of this study is to identify small molecules from natural products that have strong binding affinity with KIR2DS2 and possible bioactivity. A library of small molecule natural compounds obtained from edible African plants was used for in Silico molecular docking simulations of KIR2DS2 (PDBID: 1m4k) using Pyrx. An arbitrary docking score [&ge;] -7.0 kcal/mol was chosen as cut off value. Screening for drug-likeness and ligand efficiency was based on the molecular descriptors of the compounds as provided by Pubchem. Further screening for saturation, molar refractivity, promiscuity, pharmacokinetic properties, and bioactivity was done using SWISSADME, PKCSM, and Molinspiration respectively. The molecular dynamic simulation and analyses was done using the Galaxy webserver which uses the GROMACS software. Analyses of molecular dynamic simulation were done using Galaxy and MDWEB webservers. Gibberellin A20 and A29 were obtained as the lead compounds and they show better promise as drug candidates for KIR2DS2 than the standard. It is recommended that the immuno-stimulatory effect of the lead compounds on KIR2DS2 be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Arpp19 is a potent inhibitor of PP2A-B55 that regulates this phosphatase to ensure the stable phosphorylation of mitotic/meiotic substrates. At G2-M, Arpp19 is phosphorylated by Greatwall on S67. This phosphorylated Arpp19 form displays a high affinity to PP2A-B55 and a slow dephosphorylation rate, acting as an \"unfair\" competitor of PP2A-B55 substrates. The molecular determinants conferring slow dephosphorylation kinetics to S67 are unknown. PKA also phosphorylates Arpp19. This phosphorylation performed on S109 is essential to maintain prophase I-arrest in Xenopus oocytes although the underlying signaling mechanism is elusive. Here, we characterized the molecular determinants conferring slow dephosphorylation to S67 and controlling PP2A-B55 inhibitory activity of Arpp19. Moreover, we showed that phospho-S109 restricts S67 phosphorylation by increasing its catalysis by PP2A-B55. Finally, we discovered a double feed-back loop between these two phospho-sites which is essential to coordinate the temporal pattern of Arpp19-dependent PP2A-B55 inhibition and Cyclin B/Cdk1 activation during cell division.",

O_SCPLOWRSC_SCPLOWO_SCPCAP-C_SCPCAPO_SCPLOWFMRIC_SCPLOW connectomics, however, has inherent analytical challenges, such as accounting for negative correlations. In addition, functional relationships between brain regions do not necessarily correspond to their anatomical distance, making the intrinsic geometry of the functional connectome less well understood. Recent techniques in natural language processing and machine learning, such as word2vec, have used embedding methods to map high-dimensional data into meaningful vector spaces. Inspired by this approach, we have developed a graph embedding pipeline, rest2vec, for studying the intrinsic geometry of functional connectomes. We demonstrate how rest2vec uses the phase angle spatial embedding (O_SCPLOWPHASEC_SCPLOW) method with dimensionality reduction techniques to embed the functional connectome into lower dimensions. Rest2vec can also be linked to the maximum mean discrepancy (O_SCPLOWMMDC_SCPLOW) metric to assign functional modules of the connectome in a continuous manner, improving upon traditional binary classification methods. Together, this allows for studying the functional connectome such that the full range of correlative information is preserved and gives a more informed understanding of the functional organization of the brain.",

    "abstract": "Object-based attention (OBA) can - in addition to acting upon explicit object representations - act upon occluded and illusory objects. It remains unknown, however, whether or not the selection of such object representations is detectable at the same level within visual cortex. This study examined the level within visual cortex (V1-V3, LOC) at which object-based selection is observed for explicit, occluded and illusory objects. During fMRI acquisition, participants identified a target preceded by a predictive arrow cue in the double-rectangle cueing paradigm. We independently localized retinotopically-specific regions of cortex corresponding to all possible target locations to examine neural fluctuations at each level of the visual cortical hierarchy. We found, after cue onset, that activity along visual cortex was not greater for representations of cued than of uncued same object locations. In contrast, we found that activity in V3 was enhanced at retinotopic representations that correspond to uncued same than different object locations. These results, together, support attentional spreading. Additionally, when the target appeared at either the cued or uncued locations, we found higher activation in areas representing uncued same object versus cued locations. This effect emerged along the visual cortical hierarchy. Further, when the target appeared on either the cued or uncued object, we found that activation in V3 transiently increased at uncued same than different object locations. This effect was also detectable upstream in LOC. These results index attentional re-orienting between locations/objects. Effects emerged regardless of object type: explicit or completed. Thus, the gating of object information proceeds completion.\n\nSignificance StatementWe investigated the level within visual cortex (V1-V3, LOC) that object-based selection is observed for explicit objects and those requiring perceptual completion. We showed that activity along visual cortex was similar for representations of locations on a cued object, which may indicate attention spreads evenly to all locations on an object marked as relevant by the cue. We also showed that activity in late visual areas was greater for representations of uncued same than different object locations, which may indicate that attention enhances the cued object. These findings support the attentional spreading account. Object selection may, thus, be instantiated by even engagement of locations within a cued, and/or suppression of locations within an uncued, object - independent of its type.",

    "abstract": "Dragonflies represent an ancient lineage of visual predators, which last shared a common ancestor with insect groups such as dipteran flies in the early Devonian, 406 million years ago [1,2]. Despite their important evolutionary status, and recent interest in them as a model for complex visual physiology and behavior, the most recent detailed description of the dragonfly optic lobe is itself more than a century old [3]. Many insects process visual information in optic lobes comprising 4 sequential, retinotopically organized neuropils: the lamina, medulla, lobula and a posterior lobula plate devoted to processing information about wide-field motion stimuli [4, 5]. Recent reports suggest that the dragonflies also follow this basic plan, with a divided lobula similar to those of flies, moths and butterflies [6, 7]. Here we refute this claim, showing that dragonflies have an unprecedentedly complex lobula comprising at least 4 sequential synaptic neuropils, in addition to two lobula plate like structures located on opposite sides of the brain. The second and third optic ganglia contain approximately twice as many synaptic layers as any other insect group yet studied. Using intracellular recording and labeling of neurons we further show that the most anterior lobe contains wide-field motion processing tangential neurons similar to those of the posterior lobula plate of dipteran flies. In addition to describing what is probably the most complex and unique optic lobe of any insect to date, our findings provide interesting insights to understanding the evolution of the insect optic lobe and serve as a reminder that the highly studied visual circuits of dipteran flies represent just a single derived form of these brain structures.",

    "abstract": "Liposomal formulations can be advantageous in a number of scenarios such as targeted delivery to reduce the systemic toxicity of highly potent Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), to increase drug bioavailability by prolonging systemic circulation, to protect labile APIs from degradation in the gastrointestinal tract, or to improve skin permeation in dermal delivery. However, not all APIs are suitable for encapsulation in liposomes. Some of the issues are too high permeability of the API across the lipid bilayer, which may lead to premature leakage, too low permeability, which may hinder the drug release process, or too strong membrane affinity, which may reduce the overall efficacy of drug release from liposomes. Since the most reliable way to test API encapsulation and release from liposomes so far has been experimental, an in silico model capable of predicting API transport across the lipid bilayer might accelerate formulation development. In this work, we demonstrate a new in silico approach to compute the temperature dependent permeability of a set of compounds across the bilayer of virtual liposomes constructed by molecular dynamics simulation. To validate this approach, we have conducted a series of experiments confirming the model predictions using a homologous series of fluorescent dyes. Based on the performance of individual molecules, we have defined a set of selection criteria for identifying compatible APIs for stable encapsulation and thermally controlled release from liposomes. To further demonstrate the in silico-based methodology, we have screened the DrugBank database, identified potent drugs suitable for liposome encapsulation and successfully carried out the loading and thermal release of one of them - an antimicrobial compound cycloserine.",

Here, we report methods to grow, differentiate and characterise mouse adult stem cell-derived caecal organoids, termed caecaloids. We compare the cellular composition of caecaloids to that of enteroids identifying differences in intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) populations that mimic those found in the caecum and small intestine. The remarkable similarity in the IECs composition and spatial conformation of caecaloids and their tissue of origin enables their use as an in vitro model to study host interactions with important caecal pathogens. Thus, exploiting this system we investigated the responses of caecal IECs to extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted/excreted by the intracellular helminth Trichuris muris. Our findings reveal novel immunoregulatory effects of whipworm EVs on the caecal epithelium, including the downregulation of responses to nucleic acid recognition and type-I interferon (IFN) signalling.",

    "abstract": "Obesity has been ascribed to corticostriatal regions taking control over homeostatic areas. To test this assumption, we applied an effective connectivity approach to reveal the direction of information flow between brain regions and the valence of connections (excitatory versus inhibitory) as a function of adiposity and homeostatic state. Forty-one participants (21 overweight/obese) underwent two resting-state fMRI scans: after overnight fasting (hunger) and following a standardised meal (satiety). We used spectral dynamic causal modelling to unravel hunger and adiposity related changes in directed connectivity between cortical, insular, striatal and hypothalamic regions. During hunger, as compared to satiety, we found increased excitation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex over the ventral striatum and hypothalamus, suggesting enhanced top-down modulation compensating energy depletion. Adiposity was associated with increased excitation of the anterior insula over the hypothalamus across the hunger and satiety conditions. The interaction of hunger and adiposity yielded decreased intra-cortical excitation from the dorsolateral to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Our findings suggest that obesity is associated with persistent top-down excitation of the hypothalamus, regardless of homeostatic state, and hunger-related reductions of dorsolateral to ventromedial prefrontal inputs. These findings are compatible with eating without hunger and reduced self-regulation views of obesity.\n\nSignificance StatementObesity is a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality. Neurobiological theories propose that, in obese people, corticostriatal regions take over homeostatic areas. Neuroimaging-based functional connectivity is well-poised to unravel such abnormalities by examining between-regions communication, but existing studies have only measured signal covariance, not direction and valence of connectivity. We applied computational modelling to reveal the direction of information flow between brain regions and excitatory/inhibitory valence of connections in obese versus healthy-weight participants. Obesity associated with heightened top-down excitation from the insula to hypothalamus, and reduced excitation within prefrontal regions. Findings have two advantages relative to current knowledge: demonstrate theory-based directional abnormalities, i.e. cortical regions taking over homeostatic areas; and inform brain stimulation therapies targeting cortical input to lower-level regions.",

    "abstract": "We can focus visuospatial attention by covertly attending to relevant locations, moving our eyes, or both simultaneously. How does shifting versus holding covert attention during fixation compare with maintaining covert attention across saccades? We acquired fMRI data during a combined saccade and covert attention task. On Eyes-fixed trials, participants either held attention at the same initial location (\"hold attention\") or shifted attention to another location midway through the trial (\"shift attention\"). On Eyes-move trials, participants made a saccade midway through the trial, while maintaining attention in one of two reference frames: The \"retinotopic attention\" condition involved holding attention at a fixation-relative location but shifting to a different screen-centered location, whereas the \"spatiotopic attention\" condition involved holding attention on the same screen-centered location but shifting relative to fixation. We localized the brain network sensitive to attention shifts (shift > hold attention), and used multivoxel pattern time course analyses to investigate the patterns of brain activity for spatiotopic and retinotopic attention. In the attention shift network, we found transient information about both whether covert shifts were made and whether saccades were executed. Moreover, in the attention shift network, both retinotopic and spatiotopic conditions were represented more similarly to shifting than to holding covert attention. An exploratory searchlight analysis revealed additional regions where spatiotopic was relatively more similar to shifting and retinotopic more to holding. Thus, maintaining retinotopic and spatiotopic attention across saccades may involve different types of updating that vary in similarity to covert attention \"hold\" and \"shift\" signals across different regions.\n\nSignificance StatementTo our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to directly compare human brain activity patterns of covert attention (to a peripheral spatial location) across saccades and during fixation. We applied fMRI multivoxel pattern time course analyses to capture the dynamic changes of activity patterns, with specific focus on the critical timepoints related to attention shifts and saccades. Our findings indicate that both retinotopic and spatiotopic attention across saccades produce patterns of activation similar to \"shifting\" attention in the brain, even though both tasks could be interpreted as \"holding\" attention by the participant. The results offer a novel perspective to understand how the brain processes and updates spatial information under different circumstances to fit the needs of various cognitive tasks.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTA customized context-dependent validation of antibodies for the prospective use, rather than a general stamp of validity, is required for reproducibility and data validity, besides the need of standardized reagents. In-situ antibody staining is a technique broadly used in experimental settings and human diagnostic practice. The first typically, but not exclusively uses lightly fixed material (cell smears, frozen sections), the second, routinely processed formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Differently from techniques based on tissue extraction, there is little awareness of the context-dependent constraints inherent with either type of in situ staining except that antigen masking associated with routine tissue processing limits the range of useful antibodies. We applied a panel of 126 antibodies validated for FFPE to lightly fixed (acetone, formalin) frozen sections and found that less than 30% performed conservatively with all fixations, 35% preferred one fixation over another, 13% gave non-specific staining, 23% did not stain at all. Individual antibody variegation of the paratope fitness for the differentially fixed antigen may be the cause. Re-validation of established antibody panels is required when applied to sections whose fixation and processing is different from the tissue where they have been initially validated.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Open research data are increasingly recognized as a quality indicator and an important resource to increase transparency, robustness and collaboration in science. However, no standardized way of reporting Open Data in publications exists, making it difficult to find shared datasets and assess the prevalence of Open Data in an automated fashion.We developed ODDPub (Open Data Detection in Publications), a text-mining algorithm that screens biomedical publications and detects cases of Open Data. Using English-language original research publications from a single biomedical research institution (n=8689) and randomly selected from PubMed (n=1500) we iteratively developed a set of derived keyword categories. ODDPub can detect data sharing through field-specific repositories, general-purpose repositories or the supplement. Additionally, it can detect shared analysis code (Open Code).To validate ODDPub, we manually screened 792 publications randomly selected from PubMed. On this validation dataset, our algorithm detected Open Data publications with a sensitivity of 0.74 and specificity of 0.97. Open Data was detected for 11.5% (n=91) of publications. Open Code was detected for 1.4% (n=11) of publications with a sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 1.00. We compared our results to the linked datasets found in the databases PubMed and Web of Science.Our algorithm can automatically screen large numbers of publications for Open Data. It can thus be used to assess Open Data sharing rates on the level of subject areas, journals, or institutions. It can also identify individual Open Data publications in a larger publication corpus. ODDPub is published as an R package on GitHub.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Computational models of such networks have successfully allowed the reprodution of known behaviour and to have a better understanding of the associated cellular processes.

    "abstract": "The non-invasive study of cortical oscillations provides a window onto neuronal processing. Temporal correlation of these oscillations between distinct anatomical regions is considered a marker of functional connectedness. As the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain, {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is thought to play a crucial role in shaping the frequency and amplitude of oscillations, which thereby suggests a role for GABA in shaping the topography of functional activity and connectivity. This study explored the effects of pharmacologically blocking the reuptake of GABA (increasing local concentrations) through oral administration of the GABA transporter 1 (GAT1) blocker tiagabine (15 mg). We show that the spatial distribution of tiagabine-induced activity changes, across the brain, corresponds to group-average flumazenil PET maps of GABAA receptor distribution.\n\nIn a placebo-controlled crossover design, we collected resting magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from 15 healthy male individuals prior to, and at 1-, 3- and 5- hours post, administration of tiagabine and placebo pill. Using leakage-corrected amplitude envelope correlations (AECs), we quantified the functional connectivity in discrete frequency bands across the whole brain, using the 90-region Automatic Anatomical Labelling atlas (AAL90), as well as quantifying the average oscillatory activity across the brain.\n\nAnalysis of variance in connectivity using a drug-by-session (2x4) design revealed interaction effects, accompanied by main effects of drug and session. Post-hoc permutation testing of each post-drug recording against the respective pre-drug baseline revealed consistent reductions of a bilateral occipital network spanning theta, alpha and beta frequencies, and across 1- 3- and 5- hour recordings following tiagabine, but not placebo.\n\nThe same analysis applied to activity, across the brain, also revealed a significant interaction, with post-hoc permutation testing demonstrating significant increases in activity across frontal regions, coupled with reductions in activity in posterior regions, across the delta, theta, alpha and beta frequency bands.\n\nCrucially, we show that the spatial distribution of tiagabine-induced changes in oscillatory activity overlap significantly with group-averaged maps of the estimated distribution of GABAA receptors, derived from scaled flumazenil volume-of-distribution (FMZ-VT) PET, hence demonstrating a possible mechanistic link between GABA availability, GABAA receptor distribution, and low-frequency network oscillations. We therefore propose that electrophysiologically-derived maps of oscillatory connectivity and activity can be used as sensitive, time-resolved, and targeted receptor-mapping tools for pharmacological imaging at the group level, providing direct measures of target engagement and pharmacodynamics.",

    "abstract": "The anterior pituitary hormone, prolactin, is a fundamental regulator of lactation, and also plays a role in many other physiological processes including maternal behaviour, reproduction, immune response and even energy balance. Indeed, prolactin receptors (Prlr) are widely distributed throughout the body, including a number of different brain regions, further attesting to its pleiotropic nature. Within the brain, previous research has identified key areas upon which prolactin exerts effects on gene transcription through the canonical JAK2/STAT5 pathway downstream of the Prlr. In some neurones, however, such as the tuberoinfundibular dopamine neurones that control prolactin secretion, prolactin can also exert rapid actions to stimulate neuronal activity. While prolactin-induced activation of STAT5 has been described in a wide variety of brain regions, its capacity for acute modulation of electrical properties of many Prlr-expressing neurones remains to be elucidated. To investigate how widespread these rapid actions of prolactin are in various Prlr-expressing neurones, we utilised a transgenic mouse line in which Cre recombinase is specifically expressed in the coding region of the prolactin long form receptor gene (Prlr-iCre). This mouse line was crossed with a Cre-dependent calcium indicator (GCaMP6f) transgenic mouse, allowing us to visually monitor the electrical activity of Prlr-expressing neurones in ex vivo 200m brain slice preparations. Here, we survey hypothalamic regions implicated in prolactins diverse physiological functions such as: the arcuate (ARC) and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus (PVN), and the medial preoptic area (MPOA). We observe that in both males and virgin and lactating females, bath application of prolactin is able to induce electrical changes in a subset of Prlr-expressing cells in all of these brain regions. The effects we detected ranged from rapid or sustained increases in intracellular calcium to inhibitory effects, indicating a heterogeneous nature of these Prlr-expressing populations. These results enhance our understanding of mechanisms by which prolactin acts on hypothalamic neurones and provide insights into how prolactin might influence neuronal circuits in the mouse brain.",

    "abstract": "The determination of spike architecture is critical to grain yield in wheat (Triticum aestivum), yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we measured 51 traits associated with spike architecture and floral development in 197 wheat accessions with photoperiod sensitive and insensitive alleles. We included five distinct allele combinations at the Photoperiod-1 (Ppd-1) loci. A systematic dissection of all recorded phenotypes revealed connections between floral development, spike architecture and grain yield. Modifying the durations of spikelet primordia initiation did not necessarily affect spikelet number. In addition, Ppd-1 loci clearly influenced rachis dry weight, pointing to the rachis vascular system as a potential target for higher yield. Ppd-1 displayed opposite effects on the durations of pre and post-anthesis phases. Ppd-1 controlled carpel size, but not anther size. Finally, the photoperiod-insensitive alleles of Ppd-1 triggered floral degeneration. In parallel, we profiled the spike transcriptome at six stages and four positions in three Ppd-1 genotypes which consists of 234 samples. Integrating phenotypic and expression data suggested that loss of function in Ppd-1 loci delayed floral degeneration by regulating autophagy and extended floret development by regulating genes in different families. Therefore, we concluded that Ppd-1 remodels spike architecture by regulating floral development in wheat.",

    "abstract": "Drought stress in maize often results in poor growth and reduced yield. Antioxidants play vital role in management of abiotic stresses. Drought or water deficit are detrimental to young seedlings establishment and transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in maize. Paclobutrazol (PBZ) has been widely used to confer abiotic stress tolerance in plants, however, its impact on root developmental attributes in maize and their relevance in drought management are least understood. Comprehensive experiments over a three year period (2017-2019) under early deficit (EDI) and terminal deficit (TDI) irrigation with or without paclobutrazol (PBZ) were conducted on five maize varieties (DDKL, DKC-9144, PG-2475, PG-2320 and Bio-9621). Plant shoot and root growth kinetics, phenological changes and physiological perturbations including antioxidant profile coupled with molecular regulation of root traits, showed DKC-9144 as best variety in terms of plant fitness and reproductive performance under deficit irrigation. Root developmental rates were key contributors towards improved plant biomass and cob yield under deficit irrigation tolerance. Structural equation modelling (SEM) demonstrated specific contribution of different root types (crown, brace and seminal roots) in maize towards improving water use efficiency, cob yield and plant height. From SEM, seminal root surface area and root length are proposed desired traits to improve water use efficiency and cob yield in DKC-9144 under deficit irrigation. Bi-variate analyses of twenty key traits of plant fitness and agronomic importance showed a strong correlation (r) between root traits and improved growth performance and yield stability indices.",

    "abstract": "Dragonfly larvae capture their prey with a strongly modified -extensible- mouthpart using a biomechanically unique but not yet understood mechanism. The current opinion of hydraulic pressure being the driving force of the predatory strike can be refuted by our manipulation experiments and reinterpretation of former studies. On this fact, we present evidence for a synchronized dual-catapult system powered by two spring-loaded catapults. The power output of the system exceeds generally the maximum power achievable by musculature. Energy for the movement is stored by straining a resilin-containing structure at each joint and possibly the surrounding cuticle which is preloaded by muscle contraction. To achieve the precise timing required to catch fast-moving prey, accessory structures are used to lock and actively trigger the system, ensuring the synchronisation of both catapults. As a proof of concept, we developed a bio-inspired robotic arm resembling the morphology and functional principle of the extensible mouthpart. Our study elucidates the predatory strike of dragonfly larvae by proposing a novel mechanism, where two synchronized catapults power the ballistic movement of prey capturing in dragonfly larvae \u2013 a so-called synchronized dual-catapult system. Understanding this complex biomechanical system may further our understanding in related fields of bio inspired robotics and biomimetics.One Sentence Summary The synchronized dual-catapult, a biomechanically novel mechanism for the ballistic movement of prey capturing in dragonfly larvaeCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

When designing cleared-tissue LSM systems with certain desired imaging specifications (e.g. resolution, contrast, and working distance), various design parameters must be taken into consideration. In order to elucidate some of the key design trade-offs for LSM systems, we present a diffraction-based analysis of single- and dual-objective LSM configurations where Gaussian illumination is utilized. Specifically, we analyze the effects of the illumination and collection numerical aperture (NA), as well as their crossing angle, on spatial resolution and contrast. Assuming an open-top light-sheet (OTLS) architecture, we constrain these parameters based on fundamental geometric considerations as well as those imposed by currently available microscope objectives. In addition to revealing the performance tradeoffs of various single- and dual-objective LSM configurations, our analysis showcases the potential advantages of a novel, non-orthogonal dual-objective (NODO) architecture, especially for moderate-resolution imaging applications (collection NA of 0.5 to 0.8).",

We examined the effect of cancer cell-intrinsic MHC class II (csMHCII) expression in lung adenocarcinoma on T cell recruitment to tumors and response to anti-PD-1 therapy. The functional significance of altering csMHCII expression was explored using two orthotopic immunocompetent murine models of non-small cell lung cancer: CMT167 (CMT) and Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC). We previously showed that CMT167 tumors are eradicated by anti-PD1 therapy, while LLC tumors are resistant. RNA-seq analysis of cancer cells recovered from tumors revealed that csMHCII correlated with response to anti-PD1 therapy, with immunotherapy-sensitive CMT167 cells being csMHCII positive, while resistant LLC cells were csMHCII negative. To test the functional effects of csMHCII, MHCII expression was altered on the cancer cells through loss- and gain-of-function of CIITA, a master regulator of the MHCII pathway. Loss of CIITA in CMT167 decreased csMHCII, and converted tumors from anti-PD-1-sensitive to anti-PD-1-resistant. This was associated with decreased T cell infiltration, lower levels of Th1 cytokines, increased B cell number and decreased macrophage recruitment. Conversely, overexpression of CIITA in LLC cells resulted in csMHCII in vitro and in vivo. Enforced expression of CIITA increased T cell infiltration and sensitized tumors to anti-PD-1 therapy. csMHCII expression was also examined in a subset of surgically resected human lung adenocarcinomas by multispectral imaging, provided a survival benefit and positively correlated with T cell infiltration. These studies demonstrate a functional role for csMHCII in regulating T cell infiltration and sensitivity to anti-PD-1.",

    "abstract": "In vivo micro-CT has already been used to monitor microstructural changes of bone in mice of different ages and in models of age-related diseases such as osteoporosis. However, as aging is accompanied by frailty and subsequent increased sensitivity to external stimuli such as handling and anesthesia, the extent to which longitudinal imaging can be applied in aging studies remains unclear. Consequently, the potential of monitoring individual mice during the entire aging process - from healthy to frail status - has not yet been exploited. In this study, we assessed the effects of long-term in vivo micro-CT imaging - consisting of 11 imaging sessions over 20 weeks - on hallmarks of aging both on a local (i.e., static and dynamic bone morphometry) and systemic (i.e., frailty index (FI) and body weight) level at various stages of the aging process. Furthermore, using a premature aging model (PolgA(D257A/D257A)), we assessed whether these effects differ between genotypes.\n\nThe 6th caudal vertebrae of 4 groups of mice (PolgA(D257A/D257A) and PolgA(+/+)) were monitored by in vivo micro-CT every 2 weeks. One group was subjected to 11 scans between weeks 20 and 40 of age, whereas the other groups were subjected to 5 scans between weeks 26-34, 32-40 and 40-46, respectively. The long-term monitoring approach showed small but significant changes in the static bone morphometric parameters compared to the other groups. However, no interaction effect between groups and genotype was found, suggesting that PolgA mutation does not render bone more or less susceptible to long-term micro-CT imaging. The differences between groups observed in the static morphometric parameters were less pronounced in the dynamic morphometric parameters. Moreover, the body weight and FI were not affected by more frequent imaging sessions. Finally, we observed that longitudinal designs including baseline measurements at young adult age are more powerful at detecting effects of in vivo micro-CT imaging on hallmarks of aging than cross-sectional comparisons between multiple groups of aged mice subjected to fewer imaging sessions.",

    "abstract": "The primary cilium is a sensory organelle projecting from the apical surface of renal epithelial cells. Dysfunctional cilia have been linked to a number of genetic diseases known as ciliopathies, which include autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Previous studies have determined that renal epithelial primary cilia express both the polycystin-2 (PC2, TRPP2) channel and the type-2 vasopressin receptor (V2R), coupled to local cAMP production. However, little is known as to how Ca2+ and cAMP signals lead to changes in the length of the primary cilium. Here, we explored how cAMP signals regulate the length of the primary cilium in wild type LLC-PK1 renal epithelial cells. Primary cilia length was determined by immunocytochemical labeling of the ciliary axoneme. Treatment of cells with the cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP (1 mM) in normal external Ca2+ (1.2 mM) produced a 25.3% increase (p < 0.0001) in the length of the primary cilium, a phenomenon also observed in cells exposed to high external Ca2+ (6.2 mM). However, exposure of cells to vasopressin (AVP, 10 M), which also increases cAMP in primary cilia of LLC-PK1 cells, mimicked the effect of 8-Br-cAMP in normal, but not in high Ca2+. Further, specific gene silencing of PC2 expression further increased primary cilium length after 8-Br-cAMP treatment, in normal, but not high Ca2+. The encompassed data indicate a crosstalk between the cAMP and Ca2+ signals to modulate the length of the primary cilium, in a phenomenon that implicates the expression of PC2.\n\nSignificance StatementMorphological changes in primary cilia have been linked to genetic disorders, including autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), a major cause of kidney disease. Both cAMP and Ca2+ are universal second messengers that regulate polycystin-2 (PC2, TRPP2), a Ca2+ permeable non-selective cation channel implicated in ADPKD, and expressed in the primary cilium of renal epithelial cells. Despite current interest, little is known as to how second messenger systems and how aberrant regulation of PC2 may link primary cilium structure with cyst formation in ADPKD. Here we determined that both the cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP and vasopressin increase the length of the primary cilium in renal epithelial cells. However, this phenomenon depends of external Ca2+ and PKD2 gene silencing. Proper cAMP signaling may be essential in the control of the primary cilium of renal epithelial cells, and the onset of cyst formation in ADPKD.",

    "abstract": "Thermal inactivation of saccharifying enzymes is a crucial issue for the efficient utilization of cellulosic biomass as a renewable resource. Cellobiohydrolases (CBHs) is a kind of cellulase. In general, CBHs belonging to glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 6 (Cel6) act synergistically with CBHs of GH family 7 (Cel7) and other carbohydrate-active enzymes during the degradation of cellulosic biomass. However, while the catalytic rate of enzymes generally becomes faster at higher temperatures, Cel6 CBHs are inactivated at lower temperatures than Cel7 CBHs, and this represents a limiting factor for industrial utilization. In this study, we produced a series of mutants of the glycoside hydrolase family 6 cellobiohydrolase PcCel6A from the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and compared their thermal stability. Eight mutants from a random mutagenesis library and one rationally designed mutant were selected as candidate thermostable mutants and produced by heterologous expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Comparison of the hydrolytic activities at 50 and 60 {degrees}C indicated that the thermal stability of PcCel6A is influenced by the number and position of cysteine residues that are not involved in disulfide bonds.",

    "abstract": "Around half of high grade serous ovarian carcinomas (HGSOC) show homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD), often caused by germline or somatic single nucleotide variant (SNV) mutations or small indels disrupting BRCA1/2. We have uniformly processed the largest collection of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from HGSOC samples to date (N=205), comprehensively characterising the somatic mutational landscape, and expression at the BRCA1/2 loci. We discover that large structural variants (SV) are a frequent but unappreciated source of BRCA1/2 disruption in these tumours. Somatic structural variation at these loci is dominated by multi-megabase deletions that span the entirety of BRCA1 (median = 4.9Mb) or BRCA2 (median = 6.2Mb), independently affecting a substantial proportion of patients (16%) in addition to those affected by damaging germline or somatic short variants, within the BRCA1/2 coding sequences (24%). In common with previous studies, we show that the presence of damaging somatic SNVs or short indels in BRCA1 (OR=10, 95% CI 1.8-103, p=0.002, adj p=0.027 and BRCA2 (OR=17, 95% CI 2.1-816), p=0.002, adj.p=0.021) was found to influence HRD. For the first time we also study the compound effect of SV and SNV or short indel mutations at both loci, demonstrating that SVs often contribute to compound deficiencies involving SNVs or indels, with large somatic deletions contributing to these compound deficiencies in 15/205 (7%) of samples. Notably the strongest risk of HRD (OR=19 (2.4-896), p=6.6x10-3, adj P=8.5x10-3) is generated by combined large deletions at BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the absence of SNVs or indels, affecting 3% of patients. Overall, we show that HRD is a complex phenotype in HGSOC tumours, affected by the patterns of shorter variants such as SNVs and indels, SVs, methylation and expression seen at multiple loci, and we construct a successful (ROC AUC = 0.75) predictive model of HRD using such variables. In addition, HRD impacts patient survival when conferred by mechanisms other than through the well-understood short variants at BRCA1/2, currently exploited in the clinic. These results alter our understanding of the mutational landscape at the BRCA1/2 loci in highly rearranged tumours, and increase the number of patients predicted to benefit from therapies exploiting HRD in tumours such as PARP inhibition.",

    "abstract": "We describe the design of a small molecule that binds the structure of a r(CUG) repeat expansion [r(CUG)exp] and reverses molecular defects in two diseases mediated by the RNA - myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). Thus, a single structure-specific ligand has potential therapeutic benefit for multiple diseases, in contrast to oligonucleotide-based modalities that are customized for each disease by nature of targeting the gene that harbors the repeat. Indeed, the small molecule binds the target with nanomolar affinity and >100-fold specificity vs. many other RNAs and DNA. Interestingly, the compounds downstream effects are different in the two diseases, owing to the location of the repeat expansion. In DM1, r(CUG)exp is harbored in the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of and mRNA, and the compound has no effect on the RNAs abundance. In FECD, however, r(CUG)exp is located in an intron, and the small molecule, by binding the repeat expansion, facilitates excision of the intron, which is then degraded by the exosome complex exonuclease, hRRP6. Thus, structure-specific, RNA-targeting small molecules can act disease-specifically to affect biology, either by disabling its gain-of-function mechanism (DM1) or by stimulating quality control pathways to rid a disease-affected cell of a toxic RNA (FECD).\n\nSignificance statementMany different diseases are caused by toxic structured RNAs. Herein, we designed a lead small molecule that binds a toxic structure and rescues disease biology. We show that a structure-specific small molecule can improve disease-associated defects in two diseases that share the common toxic RNA structure. In one disease, the toxic structure is harbored in an intron and causes its retention. The compound facilitates processing of a retained intron, enabling the disease-affected cell to remove the toxic RNA.",

Hepatocellular stellate cells (HSCs) activation by oxidative stress and inflammation is the hallmark of liver fibrosis and leads to cirrhosis and liver failure resistant to pharmacological management. Cannabinoids have been suggested as a potential therapy for liver fibrosis, prompting us to explore the antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects of {Delta}9-THCA-A, a major non-psychotropic cannabinoid from Cannabis sativa L., in animal models of NAFLD.\n\nMethodsNon-alcoholic liver fibrosis was induced in mice by CCl4 treatment or, alternatively, by 23-week high fat diet (HFD) feeding. {Delta}9-THCA was administered daily intraperitoneally during the CCl4 treatment or during the last 3 weeks in HFD-fed mice.

However, short and/or overlapping genes can be difficult to detect using conventional computational approaches, whereas high throughput experimental approaches - such as ribosome profiling - cannot distinguish translation of functional peptides from regulatory translation or translational noise. By studying regions showing enhanced conservation at synonymous sites in alignments of SARS-CoV and related viruses (subgenus Sarbecovirus), and correlating with the conserved presence of an open reading frame and plausible translation mechanism, we identified a putative new gene, ORF3a*, overlapping ORF3a in an alternative reading frame. A recently published ribosome profiling study confirmed that ORF3a* is indeed translated during infection. ORF3a* is conserved across the subgenus Sarbecovirus, and encodes a 40-41 amino acid predicted transmembrane protein.",

Forty-four S2P-specific monoclonal antibodies were generated, three of which bound to the receptor binding domain (RBD). The antibodies were minimally mutated from germline and were derived from different B cell lineages. Only two antibodies displayed neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudo-virus. The most potent antibody bound the RBD in a manner that prevented binding to the ACE2 receptor, while the other bound outside the RBD. Our study indicates that the majority of antibodies against the viral envelope spike that were generated during the first weeks of COVID-19 infection are non-neutralizing and target epitopes outside the RBD. Antibodies that disrupt the SARS-CoV-2 spike-ACE2 interaction can potently neutralize the virus without undergoing extensive maturation.

    "abstract": "The SARS-Cov-2 virion responsible for the current world-wide pandemic Covid-19 has a characteristic Spike protein (S) on its surface that embellishes both a prefusion state and fusion state. The prefusion Spike protein (S) is a large trimeric protein where each protomer may be in a so-called Up state or Down state, depending on the configuration of its receptor binding domain (RBD). The Up state is believed to allow binding of the virion to ACE-2 receptors on human epithelial cells, whereas the Down state is believed to be relatively inactive or reduced in its binding behavior. We have performed detailed all-atom, dominant energy landscape mappings for noncovalent interactions (charge, partial charge, and van der Waals) of the SARS-Cov-2 Spike protein in its static prefusion state based on recent structural information. We included both interchain interactions and intrachain (domain) interactions in our mappings in order to determine any telling differences (different so-called \"glue\" points) between residues in the Up and Down state protomers. In general, the S2 or fusion machinery domain of S is relatively rigid with strong noncovalent interactions facilitated by helical secondary structures, whereas the S1 domain, which contains the RBD and N-terminal domain (NTD), is relatively more flexible and characterized by beta strand structural motifs. The S2 domain demonstrated no appreciable energetic differences between Up and Down protomers, including interchain as well as each protomers intrachain, S1-S2 interactions. However, the S1 domain interactions across neighboring protomers, which include the RBD-NTD cross chain interactions, showed significant energetic differences between Up-Down and Down-Down neighboring protomers. Surprisingly, the Up-Down, RBD-NTD interactions were overall stronger and more numerous than the Down-Down cross chain interactions, including the appearance of the three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 associated with a turn structure in the RBD of the Up state protomer. Additionally, our intrachain dominant energy mappings within each protomer, identified a significant \"glue\" point or possible \"latch\" for the Down state protomer between the S1 subdomain, SD1, and the RBD domain of the same protomer that was completely missing in the Up state protomer analysis. Ironically, this dominant energetic interaction in the Down state protomer involved the backbone atoms of the same three residue sequence ALA520-PRO521-ALA522 of the RBD with the R-group of GLN564 in the SD1 domain. Thus, this same three residue sequence acts as a stabilizer of the RBD in the Up conformation through its interactions with its neighboring NTD chain and a kind of latch in the Down state conformation through its interactions with its own SD1 domain. The dominant interaction energy residues identified here are also conserved across reported variations of SARS-Cov-2, as well as the closely related virions SARS-Cov and the bat corona virus RatG13. To help verify the potential latch for the Down state protomer, we conducted some preliminary molecular dynamic simulations that effectively turn off this specific latch glue point via a single point mutation of GLN564. Interestingly, the single point mutation lead to the latch releasing in less than a few nanoseconds, but the latch remained fixed in the wild state protomer for up to 0.1 microseconds that were simulated. Many more detailed studies are needed to understand the dynamics of the Up and Down states of the Spike protein, including the stabilizing chain-chain interactions and the mechanisms of transition from Down to Up state protomers. Nonetheless, static dominant energy landscape mappings and preliminary molecular dynamic studies given here may represent a useful starting point for more detailed dynamic analyses and hopefully an improved understanding of the structure-function relationship of this highly complex protein associated with COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Effective response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic requires genomic resources and bioinformatics tools for genomic epidemiology and surveillance studies that involve characterizing full-length viral genomes, identifying origins of infections, determining the relatedness of viral infections, performing phylogenetic analyses, and monitoring the continuous evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes. The Childrens Hospital, Los Angeles (CHLA) COVID-19 Analysis Research Database (CARD) (https://covid19.cpmbiodev.net/) is a comprehensive genomic resource that provides access to full-length SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes and associated meta-data for over 30,000 (as of May 20, 2020) isolates collected from global sequencing repositories and the sequencing performed at the Center for Personalized Medicine (CPM) at CHLA. Reference phylogenetic trees of global and USA viral isolates were constructed and are periodically updated using selected high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. These provide the baseline and analytical context for identifying the origin of a viral infection, as well as the relatedness of SARS-CoV-2 genomes of interest. A web-based and interactive Phylogenetic Tree Browser supports flexible tree manipulation and advanced analysis based on keyword search while highlighting time series animation, as well as subtree export for graphical representation or offline exploration. A Virus Genome Tracker accepts complete or partial SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence, compares it against all available sequences in the database (>30,000 at time of writing), detects and annotates the variants, and places the new viral isolate within the global or USA phylogenetic contexts based upon variant profiles and haplotype comparisons, in a few seconds. The generated analysis can potentially aid in genomic surveillance to trace the transmission of any new infection. Using CHLA CARD, we demonstrate the identification of a candidate outbreak point where 13 of 31 CHLA internal isolates may have originated. We also discovered multiple indels of unknown clinical significance in the orf3a gene, and revealed a number of USA-specific variants and haplotypes.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led to a global health crisis, and yet our understanding of the disease pathophysiology and potential treatment options remains limited. SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs through binding and internalization of the viral spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on the host cell membrane. Lethal complications are caused by damage and failure of vital organs that express high levels of ACE2, including the lungs, the heart and the kidneys. Here, we established a high-throughput drug screening strategy to identify therapeutic candidates that reduce ACE2 levels in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiac cells. Drug target analysis of validated hit compounds, including 5 alpha reductase inhibitors, revealed androgen signaling as a key modulator of ACE2 levels. Treatment with the 5 alpha reductase inhibitor dutasteride reduced ACE2 levels and internalization of recombinant spike receptor binding domain (Spike-RBD) in hESC-derived cardiac cells and human alveolar epithelial cells. Finally, clinical data on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients demonstrated that abnormal androgen states are significantly associated with severe disease complications and cardiac injury as measured by blood troponin T levels. These findings provide important insights on the mechanism of increased disease susceptibility in male COVID-19 patients and identify androgen receptor inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe at an alarming rate. However, unlike any of the previous global outbreaks the availability of a large number of SARS-CoV-2 sequences provides us with a unique opportunity to understand viral evolution in real time. We analysed 1448 full-length (>29000 nt) sequences available and identified 40 single-nucleotide substitutions occurring in >1% of the genomes. Majority of the substitutions were C to T or G to A. We identify C/Gs with an upstream TTT trinucleotide motif as hotspots for mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Interestingly, three of the 40 substitutions occur within highly conserved secondary structures in the 5 and 3 regions of the genomic RNA that are critical for the virus life cycle. Furthermore, clustering analysis revealed unique geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 variants defined by their mutation profile. Of note, we observed several co-occurring mutations that almost never occur individually. We define five mutually exclusive lineages (A1, B1, C1, D1 and E1) of SARS-CoV-2 which account for about three quarters of the genomes analysed. We identify lineage-defining leading mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome which precede the occurrence of sub-lineage defining trailing mutations. The identification of mutually exclusive lineage-defining mutations with geographically restricted patterns of distribution has potential implications for diagnosis, pathogenesis and vaccine design. Our work provides novel insights on the temporal evolution of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nImportanceThe SARS-CoV-2 / COVID-19 pandemic has spread far and wide with high infectivity. However, the severeness of the infection as well as the mortality rates differ greatly across different geographic areas. Here we report high frequency mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes which show the presence of linage-defining, leading and trailing mutations. Moreover, we propose for the first time, five mutually exclusive clusters of SARS-CoV-2 which account for 75% of the genomes analysed. This will have implications in diagnosis, pathogenesis and vaccine design",

    "abstract": "Cas9 is an RNA-guided endonuclease in the bacterial CRISPR-Cas immune system and a popular tool for genome editing. The most commonly used Cas9 variant, Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), is relatively non-specific and prone to off-target genome editing. Other Cas9 orthologs and engineered variants of SpCas9 have been reported to be more specific than wild-type (WT) SpCas9. However, systematic comparisons of the cleavage activities of these Cas9 variants have not been reported. In this study, we employed our high-throughput in vitro cleavage assay to compare cleavage activities and specificities of two natural Cas9 variants (SpCas9 and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9) and three engineered SpCas9 variants (SpCas9 HF1, HypaCas9, and HiFi Cas9). We observed that all Cas9s tested were able to cleave target sequences with up to five mismatches. However, the rate of cleavage of both on-target and off-target sequences varied based on the target sequence and Cas9 variant. For targets with multiple mismatches, SaCas9 and engineered SpCas9 variants are more prone to nicking, while WT SpCas9 creates double-strand breaks (DSB). These differences in cleavage rates and DSB formation may account for the varied specificities observed in genome editing studies. Our analysis reveals mismatch position-dependent, off-target nicking activity of Cas9 variants which have been underreported in previous in vivo studies.",

    "abstract": "Cereulide-producing members of Bacillus cereus sensu lato (B. cereus s.l.) Group III, also known as \"emetic B. cereus\", possess cereulide synthetase, a plasmid-encoded, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase encoded by the ces gene cluster. Despite the documented risks that cereulide-producing strains pose to public health, the level of genomic diversity encompassed by \"emetic B. cereus\" has never been evaluated at a whole-genome scale. Here, we employ a phylogenomic approach to characterize Group III B. cereus s.l. genomes which possess ces (ces-positive) alongside their closely related ces-negative counterparts to (i) assess the genomic diversity encompassed by \"emetic B. cereus\", and (ii) identify potential ces loss and/or gain events within the evolutionary history of the high-risk and medically relevant sequence type (ST) 26 lineage often associated with emetic foodborne illness. Using all publicly available ces-positive Group III B. cereus s.l. genomes and the ces-negative genomes interspersed among them (n = 150), we show that \"emetic B. cereus\" is not clonal; rather, multiple lineages within Group III harbor cereulide-producing strains, all of which share a common ancestor incapable of producing cereulide (posterior probability [PP] 0.86-0.89). The ST 26 common ancestor was predicted to have emerged as ces-negative (PP 0.60-0.93) circa 1904 (95% highest posterior density [HPD] interval 1837.1-1957.8) and first acquired the ability to produce cereulide before 1931 (95% HPD 1893.2-1959.0). Three subsequent ces loss events within ST 26 were observed, including among isolates responsible for B. cereus s.l. toxicoinfection (i.e., \"diarrheal\" illness).\n\nImportance\"B. cereus\" is responsible for thousands of cases of foodborne disease each year worldwide, causing two distinct forms of illness: (i) intoxication via cereulide (i.e., \"emetic\" syndrome) or (ii) toxicoinfection via multiple enterotoxins (i.e., \"diarrheal\" syndrome). Here, we show that \"emetic B. cereus\" is not a clonal, homogenous unit that resulted from a single cereulide synthetase gain event followed by subsequent proliferation; rather, cereulide synthetase acquisition and loss is a dynamic, ongoing process that occurs across lineages, allowing some Group III B. cereus s.l. populations to oscillate between diarrheal and emetic foodborne pathogen over the course of their evolutionary histories. We also highlight the care that must be taken when selecting a reference genome for whole-genome sequencing-based investigation of emetic B. cereus s.l. outbreaks, as some reference genome selections can lead to a confounding loss of resolution and potentially hinder epidemiological investigations.",

    "abstract": "1Mass mortalities of the larval stage of the giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii, have been occurring in Bangladesh since 2011. Mortalities can reach 100% and have resulted in an 80% decline in the number of hatcheries actively producing M. rosenbergii. To investigate a causative agent for the mortalities, a disease challenge was carried out using infected material from a hatchery experiencing mortalities. Moribund larvae from the challenge were prepared for metatranscriptomic sequencing. De novo virus assembly revealed a 29 kb single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with similarities in key protein motif sequences to yellow head virus (YHV), an RNA virus that causes mass mortalities in marine shrimp aquaculture, and other viruses in the Nidovirales order. Primers were designed against the novel virus and used to screen cDNA from larvae sampled from hatcheries in the South of Bangladesh from two consecutive years. Larvae from all hatcheries screened from both years were positive by PCR for the novel virus, including larvae from a hatchery that at the point of sampling appeared healthy, but later experienced mortalities. These screens suggest that the virus is widespread in M. rosenbergii hatchery culture in southern Bangladesh, and that early detection of the virus can be achieved by PCR. The hypothesised protein motifs of MrGV suggest that it is likely to be a new species within the Nidovirales order. Biosecurity measures should be taken in order to mitigate global spread through the movement of post-larvae within and between countries, which has previously been linked to other virus outbreaks in crustacean aquaculture.",

During the first few months of the pandemic, over 5,200 new Wikipedia pages on COVID-19 have been created and have accumulated over 400M pageviews by mid June 2020.1 At the same time, an unprecedented amount of scientific articles on COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic have been published online. Wikipedias contents are based on reliable sources such as scientific literature. Given its public function, it is crucial for Wikipedia to rely on representative and reliable scientific results, especially so in a time of crisis. We assess the coverage of COVID-19-related research in Wikipedia via citations to a corpus of over 160,000 articles. We find that Wikipedia editors are integrating new research at a fast pace, and have cited close to 2% of the COVID-19 literature under consideration. While doing so, they are able to provide a representative coverage of COVID-19-related research. We show that all the main topics discussed in this literature are proportionally represented from Wikipedia, after accounting for article-level effects. We further use regression analyses to model citations from Wikipedia and show that Wikipedia editors on average rely on literature which is highly cited, widely shared on social media, and has been peer-reviewed.",
