    "abstract": "We show that DNA methylation is a layered process in B lymphocytes. An underlying foundational methylome is stably established during B lineage commitment and overlaid with a DNMT3A-maintained dynamic methylome which is sculpted in distinct ways in B1 and B2 B cells during B cell development. An engineered loss of DNMT3A after commitment to the B lineage unmasks a foundational methylome that is shared in both B1 and B2 sub-lineages. The dynamic methylome is comprised of novel enhancers whose methylation state is maintained by DNMT3A but can be modulated in strikingly different ways in B1 and B2 B cells. During B1 B cell development, the dynamic methylome undergoes a prominent programmed demethylation event that is not observed during B2 B cell development. The methylation pattern of the dynamic methylome is determined by the coincident recruitment of DNMT3A and TET enzymes and it regulates the developmental expression of B1 and B2 lineage-specific genes.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe morphological characteristics of the thumb are of particular interest due to its fundamental role in enhanced manipulation. Despite its possible importance regarding this issue, the body of the first metacarcapal (MC1) has not been fully characterized using morphometrics. This could provide further insights into its anatomy, as well as its relationship with manipulative capabilities. Hence, this study quantifies the shape of the MC1s body in the extant Homininae and some fossil hominins to provide a better characterization of its morphology.\n\nMaterials and methodsThe sample includes MC1s of modern humans (n=42), gorillas (n=27) and chimpanzees (n=30), as well as Homo neanderthalensis, Homo naledi and Australopithecus sediba. 3D geometric morphometrics were used to quantify the shape of MC1s body.\n\nResultsThe results show a clear distinction among the three extant genera. H. neanderthalensis mostly falls within the modern human range of variation. H. naledi varies slightly from modern humans, although also showing some unique trait combination, whereas A. sediba varies to an even greater extent. When classified using a discriminant analysis, the three fossils are categorized within the Homo group. Conclusion: The modern human MC1 is characterized by a distinct suite of traits, not present to the same extent in the great apes, that are consistent with an ability to use forceful precision grip. This morphology was also found to align very closely with that of H. neanderthalensis. H. naledi shows a number of human-like adaptations, whilst A. sediba presents a mix of both derived and more primitive traits.",

    "abstract": "Many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are highly dysregulated in cancer and are emerging as therapeutic targets. One example is NEAT1, which consists of two overlapping lncRNA isoforms, NEAT1_1 (3.7kb) and NEAT1_2 (23kb), that are functionally distinct. The longer NEAT1_2 is responsible for scaffolding gene-regulatory nuclear bodies termed paraspeckles, whereas NEAT1_1 is involved in paraspeckle-independent function. The NEAT1 isoform ratio is dependent on the efficient cleavage and polyadenylation of NEAT1_1 at the expense of NEAT1_2. Here we developed a targeted antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) approach to sterically block NEAT1_1 polyadenylation processing, achieving upregulation of NEAT1_2 and abundant paraspeckles. We have applied these ASOs to cells of the heterogeneous infant cancer, neuroblastoma, as we found higher NEAT1_1:NEAT1_2 ratio and lack of paraspeckles in high-risk neuroblastoma cells. These ASOs decrease NEAT1_1 levels, increase NEAT1_2/paraspeckles and concomitantly reduce cell viability in high-risk neuroblastoma specifically. In contrast, overexpression of NEAT1_1 has the opposite effect, increasing cell-proliferation. Transcriptomic analyses of high-risk neuroblastoma cells with altered NEAT1 ratios and increased paraspeckle abundance after ASO treatment showed an upregulation of differentiation pathways, as opposed to the usual aggressive neuroblastic phenotype. Thus, we have developed potential anti-cancer ASO drugs that can transiently increase growth-inhibiting NEAT1_2 RNA at the expense of growth-promoting NEAT1_1 RNA. These ASOs, unlike others that degrade lncRNAs, provide insights into the importance of altering lncRNA polyadenylation events to suppress tumorigenesis as a strategy to combat cancer.",

Mature piRNAs engage Piwi Argonaute proteins to silence complementary transcripts, including transposable elements and endogenous genes. piRNA biogenesis mechanisms are diverse and remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) core subunit RPB-9 as required for piRNA-mediated silencing in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. rpb-9 mutants fail to initiate heritable piRNA-mediated gene silencing. Furthermore, we show that RPB-9 is required to repress two DNA transposon families and a subset of somatic genes in the C. elegans germline. We provide genetic and biochemical evidence that RPB-9 is required for piRNA biogenesis. We demonstrate that RPB-9 acts to promote transcriptional elongation/termination at endogenous piRNA loci. We conclude that as a part of its rapid evolution the piRNA pathway has co-opted another ancient machinery, this time for high-fidelity transcription.",

    "abstract": "Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is a serious threat to global public health, making the development of new antimicrobials an urgent necessity. Pyocins are protein antibiotics produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to kill closely related cells during intraspecific competition. Here, we report an in depth biochemical, microbicidal and structural characterization of a new S-type pyocin, named S8. Initially, we described the domain organization and secondary structure of S8. Subsequently, we observed that a recombinant S8 composed of the killing subunit in complex with the immunity (Im) protein killed the strain PAO1. Furthermore, mutation of a highly conserved glutamic acid to alanine (Glu100Ala) completely inhibited this antimicrobial activity. Probably the integrity of the H-N-H motif is essential in the killing activity of S8, as Glu100 is a highly conserved component of this structure. Next, we observed that S8 is a metal-dependent endonuclease, as EDTA treatment abolished its ability to cleave supercoiled pUC18 plasmid. Supplementation of apo S8 with Ni2+ strongly induced this DNase activity, whereas Mn2+ and Mg2+ exhibited moderate effects and Zn2+ was inhibitory. Additionally, S8 bound Zn2+ with a higher affinity than Ni2+ and the Glu100Ala mutation decreased the affinity of S8 for these metals as shown by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Finally, we describe the crystal structure of the Glu100Ala pyocin-S8DNase-Im complex at 1.38 [A], which gave us new insights into the endonuclease activity of S8. Our results reinforce the possible use of S8 as an alternative antibiotic for MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, while leaving commensal human microbiota intact.",

However, its filamentous properties and functions inside the mammalian cell nucleus are less well explored. We previously described transient actin assembly at mitotic exit that promotes nuclear expansion during chromatin decondensation. Here, we identify non-muscle ACTN4 as a critical regulator to facilitate F-actin formation, reorganization and bundling during postmitotic nuclear expansion. ACTN4 binds to nuclear actin filaments and ACTN4 clusters associate with nuclear F-actin in a highly dynamic fashion. ACTN4 but not ACTN1 is required for proper postmitotic nuclear volume expansion, mediated by its actin binding domain. Using super-resolution imaging to quantify actin filament numbers and widths in individual nuclei we find that ACTN4 is necessary for postmitotic nuclear actin assembly and actin filament bundling. Our findings uncover a nuclear cytoskeletal function for ACTN4 to control nuclear size during mitotic cell division.",

Here we show, using conditional deletion strategies in a mouse model of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7-induced inflammation, that the spectrum of developmental cell fates of Ly6Chi monocytes, and the resultant inflammation, is coordinately regulated by TLR and Notch signaling. Cell-intrinsic Notch2 and TLR7-Myd88 pathways independently and synergistically promote Ly6Clo patrolling monocyte development from Ly6Chi monocytes under inflammatory conditions, while impairment in either signaling axis impairs Ly6Clo monocyte development. At the same time, TLR7 stimulation in the absence of functional Notch2 signaling promotes resident tissue macrophage gene expression signatures in monocytes and ectopic differentiation of Ly6Chi monocytes into macrophages and dendritic cells, which appear in the blood stream and infiltrate the spleen and major blood vessels, resulting in unrestrained systemic inflammation. Thus, Notch2 is a master regulator of Ly6Chi monocyte cell fate and inflammation in response to TLR signaling.",

This suppression could involve evolutionary tradeoffs that compromise gametogenesis and contribute to infertility. Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an organism containing numerous gamete-killing wtf drivers, offers a tractable system to test this hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that in scenarios analogous to outcrossing, wtf drivers generate a fitness landscape in which atypical gametes, such as aneuploids and diploids, are advantageous. In this context, wtf drivers can decrease the fitness cost of mutations that disrupt meiotic fidelity and, in some circumstances, can even make such mutations beneficial. Moreover, we find that S. pombe isolates vary greatly in their ability to make haploid gametes, with some isolates generating more than 25% aneuploid or diploid gametes. This work empirically demonstrates the potential for meiotic drivers to shape the evolution of gametogenesis.",

    "abstract": "While current combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) allows control of HIV replication in patients and effectively suppresses plasma viral loads, it is unable to target latent reservoirs, which are responsible for virus rebound after discontinuation of therapy. Several histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) have been shown to target reservoirs and to reactivate latent HIV. While this effect is highly desired, it carries the risk that HIV-1 may be reactivated in tissue compartments were cART concentrations are insufficient and thus leading to de novo infections in this sites. To address this concern, we evaluated the effect of different HDACIs for their ability to reverse HIV latency and to modulate de novo infections. Two of the inhibitors, sodium butyrate and bufexamac, significantly inhibited de novo HIV-1 infection in activated CD4+ T-cells. Transcriptome and proteome analysis indicated global changes of protein abundancies, exhibited reduced proliferation of CD4+ T-cells, and revealed butyrate-based proteasomal degradation of EP300, an important factor for HIV-1 replication.

Understanding how these modifications arise will inform us of how mosquitoes are responding to climate change and vector control interventions.

Here we utilise a transgenic line with fluorescent oenocytes to purify these cells for the first time.

    "abstract": "Mucormycosis, caused by Rhizopus species, is a life-threatening fungal infection that occurs in patients immunocompromised by diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunosuppressive therapy, hematologic malignancies or severe trauma. Inhaled Rhizopus spores cause pulmonary infections in patients with hematologic malignancies, while patients with DKA are much more prone to rhinoorbital/cerebral mucormycosis. Here we show that R. delemar interacts with glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) on nasal epithelial cells via its spore coat protein CotH3 to invade and damage the nasal epithelial cell. Expression of the two proteins is significantly enhanced by high glucose, iron and ketone body levels (hallmark features of DKA), potentially leading to frequently lethal rhinoorbital/cerebral mucormycosis. In contrast, R. delemar CotH7 recognizes integrin {beta}1 as a receptor on alveolar epithelial cells causing the activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) leading to host cell invasion. Anti-integrin {beta}1 antibodies inhibit R. delemar invasion of alveolar epithelial cells and protect mice from pulmonary mucormycosis. Our results show that R. delemar interacts with different mammalian receptors depending on the host cell type. Susceptibility of patients with DKA primarily to rhinoorbital/cerebral disease can be explained by host factors typically present in DKA and known to upregulate CotH3 and nasal GRP78 thereby trapping the fungal cells within the rhino-orbital milieu, leading to subsequent invasion and damage. Our studies highlight that mucormycosis pathogenesis can potentially be overcome by the development of novel customized therapies targeting niche-specific host receptors or their respective fungal ligands.\n\nImportanceMucormycosis caused by Rhizopus species is a fungal infection with often fatal prognosis. Inhalation of spores is the major route of entry, with nasal and alveolar epithelial cells among the first cells that encounter the fungi. In patients with hematologic malignancies or those undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy, Rhizopus causes pulmonary infections. On the other hand, DKA patients predominantly suffer from rhinoorbital/cerebral mucormycosis. The reason for such disparity in disease types by the same fungus is not known. Here we show that, the unique susceptibility of DKA subjects to rhinoorbital/cerebral mucormycosis is likely due to specific interaction between nasal epithelial cell GRP78 and fungal CotH3, the expression of which increase in the presence of host factors present in DKA. In contrast, pulmonary mucormycosis is initiated via interaction of inhaled spores expressing CotH7 with integrin {beta}1 receptor which activates EGFR to induce fungal invasion of host cells. These results introduce plausible explanation to disparate disease manifestations in DKA versus hematologic malignancy patients and provide a foundation for development of therapeutic interventions against these lethal forms of mucormycosis.",

This technique has been largely limited to protein nanocrystals which grow either as needles or plates measuring only a few hundred nanometres in thickness. Furthermore, traditional microED data processing uses established X-ray crystallography software that is not optimised for handling compound effects that are unique to electron diffraction data. Here, we present an integrated workflow for microED, from sample preparation by cryo-focused ion beam milling, through data collection with a standard Ceta-D detector, to data processing using the DIALS software suite, thus enabling routine atomic structure determination of protein crystals of any size and shape using microED. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the workflow by determining the structure of proteinase K to 2.0 [A] resolution and show the advantage of using protein crystal lamellae over nanocrystals.",

    "abstract": "Reverse transcription, an essential event in the HIV-1 lifecycle, requires deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) to fuel DNA synthesis, thus requiring penetration of dNTPs into the viral core. The central cavity of the capsid protein (CA) hexamer reveals itself as a plausible channel that allows the passage of dNTPs into assembled capsids. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of nucleotide import into the capsid remains unknown. Employing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we established that cooperative binding between nucleotides inside a CA hexamer cavity results in energetically-favorable conditions for passive translocation of dNTPs into the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, binding of the host cell metabolite inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) enhances dNTP import, while binding of synthesized molecules like benzenehexacarboxylic acid (BHC) inhibits it. The enhancing effect on reverse transcription by IP6 and the consequences of interactions between CA and nucleotides were corroborated using atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and virological assays. Collectively, our results provide an atomistic description of the permeability of the HIV-1 capsid to small molecules and reveal a novel mechanism for the involvement of metabolites in HIV-1 capsid stabilization, nucleotide import and reverse transcription.",

    "abstract": "Among vertebrates, placental mammals are particularly variable in the covariance between their cranial shapes and body size (allometry), with the notable exception of rodents. Australian murid rodents present an opportunity to assess the cause of this anomaly because they radiated on an ecologically diverse continent unique for lacking other terrestrial placentals. Here we used 3D geometric morphometrics to quantify species-level and evolutionary allometries in 38 species (317 crania) from all Australian murid genera. We ask if ecological opportunity resulted in greater allometric diversity; conversely, we test if intrinsic constraints and/or stabilizing selection conserved allometry. To increase confidence in species-level allometric slopes, we introduce a new phylogeny-based method of bootstrapping and randomly resampling across the whole sample. We found exceedingly conserved allometry across the 10 million year split between Mus and the clade containing Australian murids. Cranial shapes followed craniofacial evolutionary allometry (CREA) patterns, with larger species having relatively longer snouts and smaller braincases. CREA is consistent with both intrinsic constraints and stabilizing selection hypotheses for conserved allometry. However, large-bodied frugivores evolved faster, while carnivorous specialists showed skull modifications known to conflict with masticatory efficiency. These results suggest a strong role of stabilizing selection on the masticatory apparatus of murid rodents.",

We use crania in sex estimation because it is useful especially when remains are fragmented or displaced, and the cranium may be the only remains found.\n\nMaterials and MethodsUsing the machine learning methods of decision tree learning, support-vector machines, k-nearest neighbor algorithm, and ensemble methods we estimate the sex of two populations: Samples from Bologna and samples from the island of Sardinia. We used two datasets, one containing 17 cranial measurements, and one measuring the foramen magnum.\n\nResults and DiscussionOur results indicate that machine learning models produce similar results to linear discriminant analysis, but in some cases machine learning produces more consistent accuracy between the sexes. Our study shows that sex can be accurately predicted (> 80%) in Italian populations using the cranial measurements we gathered, except for the foramen magnum, which shows a level of accuracy of [~]70% accurate which is on par with previous geometric morphometrics studies using crania in sex estimation. We also find that our trained machine learning models produce population-specific results; we see that Italian crania are sexually dimorphic, but the features that are important to this dimorphism differ between the populations.",

    "abstract": "The Arp2/3 complex regulates many cellular processes by stimulating formation of branched actin filament networks. Because three of its seven subunits exist as two different isoforms, mammals produce a family of Arp2/3 complexes with different properties that may be suited to different physiological contexts. To shed light on how isoform diversification affects Arp2/3 function, we determined a 4.2 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of the most active human Arp2/3 complex containing ARPC1B and ARPC5L, and compared it with the structure of the least active ARPC1A-ARPC5-containing complex. The architecture of each isoform-specified Arp2/3 is the same. Strikingly, however, the N-terminal half of ARPC5L is partially disordered compared to ARPC5, suggesting that this region of ARPC5/ARPC5L is an important determinant of complex activity. Confirming this idea, the nucleation activity of Arp2/3 complexes containing hybrid ARPC5/ARPC5L subunits is higher when the ARPC5L N-terminus is present, thereby explaining activity differences between the different Arp2/3 complexes.",

    "abstract": "Tracing the motion of macromolecules, viruses, and nanoparticles adsorbed onto cell membranes is currently the most direct way of probing the complex dynamic interactions behind vital biological processes, including cell signalling, trafficking, and viral infection. The resulting trajectories are usually consistent with some type of anomalous diffusion, but the molecular origins behind the observed anomalous behaviour are usually not obvious. Here we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to help identify the physical mechanisms that can give rise to experimentally observed trajectories of nanoscopic objects moving on biological membranes. We find that diffusion on membranes of high fluidities typically results in normal diffusion of the adsorbed nanoparticle, irrespective of the concentration of receptors, receptor clustering, or multivalent interactions between the particle and membrane receptors. Gel-like membranes on the other hand result in anomalous diffusion of the particle, which becomes more pronounced at higher receptor concentrations. This anomalous diffusion is characterised by local particle trapping in the regions of high receptor concentrations and fast hopping between such regions. The normal diffusion is recovered in the limit where the gel membrane is saturated with receptors. We conclude that hindered receptor diffusivity can be a common reason behind the observed anomalous diffusion of viruses, vesicles, and nanoparticles adsorbed on cell and model membranes. Our results enable direct comparison with experiments and offer a new route for interpreting motility experiments on cell membranes.",

    "abstract": "The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is a prime biological model to study mechanisms underlying asymmetric growth. Previous studies have shown that, prior to yeast bud emergence, polarization of a conserved small GTPase, Cdc42, must be established. Additionally, hydrolase changes the mechanical properties of the cell wall and plasma membrane with the periplasm between them (cell surface). However, how the surface mechanical properties in the emerging bud are different from the properties of the mother cell and their role in bud formation are not well understood. We hypothesize that the polarized chemical signal alters the local dimensionless ratio of stretching to bending stiffness of the cell surface of the emerging yeast bud. To test this hypothesis, a novel three-dimensional coarse-grained particle-based model has been developed which describes inhomogeneous mechanical properties of the cell surface. Model simulations suggest that regulation of the dimensionless ratio of stretching to bending stiffness of the cell surface is necessary to initiate bud formation. Furthermore, model simulations predict that bud shape depends strongly on the experimentally observed molecular distribution of the polarized signaling molecule Cdc42, while the neck shape of the emerging bud is strongly impacted by the properties of the chitin and septin ring. This 3D model of asymmetric cell growth can also be used for studying viral budding and other vegetative reproduction processes performed via budding.",

Our results reveal that the hybrid zone between the lineages ranges across the entire Baltic Sea and parts of the North Sea with the foreign ancestry decreasing with increasing distance to the source population. Introgression has also penetrated currently isolated freshwater populations. We identified footprints of selection on regions enriched for introgressed variants, suggesting that some of the introgression has been adaptive. However, the levels of introgression were in general negatively correlated with the recombination rate, suggesting that the introgression has been largely neutral and adaptive ancestral standing variation likely had a more important role in shaping the genomic landscape.

    "abstract": "The alpha ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, prolyl-4-hydroxylase 3 (PHD3), is a hypoxia-inducible factor target that uses molecular oxygen to hydroxylate proline. While PHD3 has been reported to influence cancer cell metabolism and liver insulin sensitivity, relatively little is known about effects of this highly conserved enzyme in insulin-secreting {beta}-cells. Here, we show that deletion of PHD3 specifically in {beta}-cells ({beta}PHD3KO) is associated with impaired glucose homeostasis in mice fed high fat diet. In the early stages of dietary fat excess, {beta}PHD3KO islets energetically rewire, leading to defects in the management of pyruvate fate and a shift away from glycolysis. However, {beta}PHD3KO islets are able to maintain oxidative phosphorylation and insulin secretion by increasing utilization of fatty acids to supply the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This nutrient-sensing switch cannot be sustained and {beta}PHD3KO islets begin to show signs of failure in response to prolonged metabolic stress, including impaired glucose-stimulated ATP/ADP rises, Ca2+ fluxes and insulin secretion. Thus, PHD3 might be a pivotal component of the {beta}-cell glucose metabolism machinery by suppressing the use of fatty acids as a primary fuel source, under obesogenic and insulin resistant states.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTProlyl-4-hydroxylase 3 (PHD3) is involved in the oxygen-dependent regulation of cell phenotype. A number of recent studies have shown that PHD3 might operate at the interface between oxygen availability and metabolism. To understand how PHD3 influences insulin secretion, which depends on intact glucose metabolism, we generated mice lacking PHD3 specifically in pancreatic {beta}-cells. These mice, termed {beta}PHD3KO, are apparently normal until fed high fat diet at which point their {beta}-cells switch to fatty acids as a fuel source. This switch cannot be tolerated and {beta}-cells in {beta}PHD3KO mice eventually fail. Thus, PHD3 maintains glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in {beta}-cells during states of fatty acid excess, such as diabetes and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal and rapidly progressing motor neuron degenerative disease that is without effective treatment. The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a major component of the innate immune system that has been implicated in ALS pathogenesis. However, the contribution of RAGE signaling to the neuroinflammation that underlies ALS neurodegeneration remains unknown. The present study therefore generated SOD1G93A mice lacking RAGE, and compared them to SOD1G93A transgenic ALS mice in respect to disease progression (i.e. body weight, survival and muscle strength), neuroinflammation and denervation markers in the spinal cord and tibialis anterior muscle. We found that complete absence of RAGE signaling exerted a protective effect on SOD1G93A pathology, slowing disease progression and significantly extending survival by [~]3 weeks, and improving motor function (rotarod and grip strength). This was associated with reduced microgliosis, cytokines, innate immune factors (complement, TLRs, inflammasomes), and oxidative stress in the spinal cord, and a reduction of denervation markers in the tibialis anterior muscle. We also documented that RAGE mRNA expression was significantly increased in the spinal cord and muscles of preclinical SOD1 and TDP43 models of ALS, supporting a widespread involvement for RAGE in ALS pathology. In summary, our results indicate that RAGE signalling drives neuroinflammation and contributes to neurodegeneration in ALS, and highlights RAGE as a potential immune therapeutic target for ALS.",

    "abstract": "Studies of personality traits in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) indicate that there are five or six constructs--sociability, dominance, neuroticism, openness, and two related to conscientiousness--that define personality in common marmosets. The present study attempted to determine whether our earlier study of laboratory-housed individuals only yielded three domains--Dominance, Sociability, and Neuroticism--because of a low amount of between-subjects variance. We therefore increased our sample size from 77 to 128. In addition, we ascertained the reliability and validity of ratings and whether polymorphisms related to the serotonin 1a receptor were associated with personality. We found Sociability, Dominance, and Negative Affect factors that resembled three domains found in previous studies, including ours. We also found an Openness and Impulsiveness factor, the latter of which bore some resemblance to Conscientiousness, and two higher-order factors, Pro-sociality and Boldness. Further analyses could not exclude the possibility that Pro-sociality and Boldness represented a higher-level of personality organization. Correlations between personality factors and well-being were consistent with the definitions of the factors. There were no significant associations between personality and genotype. These results are consistent with the possibility that common marmoset personality structure varies as a function of rearing or housing variables that have not yet been investigated systematically.",

    "abstract": "Sexually antagonistic (SA) genetic variation--in which genotypes favoured in one sex are disfavoured in the other--is predicted to be common and has been documented in several animal and plant populations, yet we currently know little about its pervasiveness among species or its population genetic basis. Recent applications of genomics in studies of SA genetic variation have highlighted considerable methodological challenges to the identification and characterisation of SA genes, raising questions about the feasibility of genomic approaches for inferring SA selection. The related fields of local adaptation and statistical genomics have previously dealt with similar challenges, and lessons from these disciplines can therefore help overcome current difficulties in applying genomics to study SA genetic variation. Here, we integrate theoretical and analytical concepts from local adaptation and statistical genomics research--including FST and FIS statistics, genome-wide association studies (GWAS), pedigree analyses, reciprocal transplant studies, and evolve-and-resequence (E&R) experiments--to evaluate methods for identifying SA genes and genome-wide signals of SA genetic variation. We begin by developing theoretical models for between-sex FST and FIS, including explicit null distributions for each statistic, and using them to critically evaluate putative signals of sex-specific selection in previously published datasets. We then highlight new statistics that address some of the limitations of FST and FIS, along with applications of more direct approaches for characterising SA genetic variation, which incorporate explicit fitness measurements. We finish by presenting practical guidelines for the validation and evolutionary analysis of candidate SA genes and discussing promising empirical systems for future work.\n\nImpact SummaryGenome sequences carry a record of the evolutionary and demographic histories of natural populations. Research over the last two decades has dramatically improved our ability to detect genomic signals of adaptation by natural selection, including several widely-used methods for identifying genes underlying local adaptation and quantitative trait variation. Yet the application of these methods to identify sexually antagonistic (SA) genes--wherein variants that are adaptive for one sex are maladaptive for the other--remains under-explored, despite the potential importance of SA selection as a mechanism for maintaining genetic variation. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that SA genetic variation is common within animal and plant populations, underscoring the need for analytical methods that can reliably identify SA genes and genomic signals of SA genetic variation. Here, we integrate statistics and experimental designs that were originally developed within the fields of local adaptation and statistical genomics and apply them to the context of sex-specific adaptation and SA genetic variation. First, we evaluate and extend statistical methods for identifying signals of SA variation from genome sequence data alone. We then apply these methods to re-analyse previously published datasets on allele frequency differences between sexes--a putative signal of SA selection. Second, we highlight more direct approaches for identifying SA genetic variation, which utilise experimental evolution and statistical associations between individual genetic variants and fitness. Third, we provide guidelines for the biological validation, evolutionary analysis, and interpretation of candidate SA polymorphisms. By building upon the strong methodological foundations of local adaptation and statistical genomics research, we provide a roadmap for rigorous analyses of genetic data in the context of sex-specific adaptation, thereby facilitating insights into the role and pervasiveness of SA variation in adaptive evolution.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomiasis persists in some Asian regions despite targeted end-game elimination measures. To determine the causes of this persistence, we performed reduced representation genome sequencing on Schistosoma japonicum miracidia collected across multiple years from transmission hotspots in Sichuan, China. We discovered strong geographic structure, suggesting that local rather than imported reservoirs are key sources of infection persistence. At the village level, parasites collected after praziquantel treatment are closely related to local pre-treatment populations. Schistosomes within villages are also highly related, suggesting that only a few parasites from a limited number of hosts drive re-infection. The close familial relationships among miracidia from different human hosts also implicates short transmission routes among humans. At the individual host level, genetic evidence indicates that multiple humans retain infections following referral for treatment. Our findings suggest that end-game schistosomiasis control measures should focus on completely extirpating local parasite reservoirs and confirming successful treatment of infected human hosts.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryLocal reservoirs are the source for persistent schistosomiasis infections despite continuous efforts aimed at complete elimination.",

As the global pandemic ensues, scientist are working to evaluate the virus and develop a vaccine to counteract the deadly disease that has impacted lives across the entire globe. We perform computational electrostatic simulations on multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein s1 in complex with human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) variants to examine differences in electrostatic interactions across the various complexes. Calculations are performed across the physiological pH range to also examine the impact of pH on these interactions. Two of six spike protein s1 variations having greater electric forces at pH levels consistent with nasal secretions and significant variations in force across all five variants of ACE2. Five out of six spike protein s1 variations have relatively consistent forces at pH levels of the lung, and one spike protein s1 variant that has low potential across a wide range of pH. These predictions indicate that variants of SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and human ACE2 in certain combinations could potentially play a role in increased binding efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 in vivo.",

We identified four pathways, ErbB, HIF-1, mTOR and TNF signaling, among others that were markedly modulated during the course of the SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Western blot validation of the downstream effector molecules of these pathways revealed a significant reduction in activated S6K1 and 4E-BP1 at 72 hours post infection. Unlike other human respiratory viruses, we found a significant inhibition of HIF-1 through the entire time course of the infection, suggesting a crosstalk between the SARS-CoV-2 and the mTOR/HIF-1 signaling.

    "abstract": "We sequenced the genomes of 320 SARS-CoV-2 strains from COVID-19 patients in metropolitan Houston, Texas, an ethnically diverse region with seven million residents. These genomes were from the viruses causing infections in the earliest recognized phase of the pandemic affecting Houston. Substantial viral genomic diversity was identified, which we interpret to mean that the virus was introduced into Houston many times independently by individuals who had traveled from different parts of the country and the world. The majority of viruses are apparent progeny of strains derived from Europe and Asia. We found no significant evidence of more virulent viral types, stressing the linkage between severe disease, underlying medical conditions, and perhaps host genetics. We discovered a signal of selection acting on the spike protein, the primary target of massive vaccine efforts worldwide. The data provide a critical resource for assessing virus evolution, the origin of new outbreaks, and the effect of host immune response.\n\nSignificanceCOVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is a global pandemic. To better understand the first phase of virus spread in metropolitan Houston, Texas, we sequenced the genomes of 320 SARS-CoV-2 strains recovered from COVID-19 patients early in the Houston viral arc. We identified no evidence that a particular strain or its progeny causes more severe disease, underscoring the connection between severe disease, underlying health conditions, and host genetics. Some amino acid replacements in the spike protein suggest positive immune selection is at work in shaping variation in this protein. Our analysis traces the early molecular architecture of SARS-CoV-2 in Houston, and will help us to understand the origin and trajectory of future infection spikes.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a widespread outbreak of highly pathogenic COVID-19. It is therefore important and timely to characterize interactions between the virus and host cell at the molecular level to understand its disease pathogenesis. To gain insights, we performed high-throughput sequencing that generated time-series data simultaneously for bioinformatics analysis of virus genomes and host transcriptomes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our analysis results showed that the rapid growth of the virus was accompanied by an early intensive response of host genes. We also systematically compared the molecular footprints of the host cells in response to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Upon infection, SARS-CoV-2 induced hundreds of up-regulated host genes hallmarked by a significant cytokine production followed by virus-specific host antiviral responses. While the cytokine and antiviral responses triggered by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were only observed during the late stage of infection, the host antiviral responses during the SARS-CoV-2 infection were gradually enhanced lagging behind the production of cytokine. The early rapid host responses were potentially attributed to the high efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, underscored by evidence of a remarkably up-regulated gene expression of TPRMSS2 soon after infection. Taken together, our findings provide novel molecular insights into the mechanisms underlying the infectivity and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.",

It has been observed that SARS-CoV-2 patients show a rather long and asymptomatic incubation time. We characterized the abilities to induce and to response to IFN{beta}/IFN{lambda}1 of two or our clinical isolates, SARS-CoV-2/NTU01/TWN/human/2020 and SARS-CoV-2/NTU02/TWN/human/2020, which exhibit only two amino acid differences over the [~]30kb viral genome. We found that both isolates may infect Huh7, A549 and Calu-3 cells, yet the RIG-I-like receptor-dependent antiviral signaling was poorly induced in these cells in the early infections. Unexpectedly, we found that the intracellular vRNA levels of these isolates were sustained upon to type I/III IFN treatments, and this phenotype was more pronounced in the Taiwan/NTU01/2020 isolate. The type I/III IFN responses are antiviral but partially proviral in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infections. Poor induction and response to innate immunity may contribute to destitute neutralization index of the antibody produced, and indeed we found that the patient serum could not efficiently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 virions. With better understandings of the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and the host antiviral innate immunity, our report may provide new insights for the regimen of therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients.",

    "abstract": "Most of the biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) found in filamentous fungi are silent under standard laboratory cultivation conditions due to the lack of expression triggering stimuli, representing a considerable drawback in drug discovery. To access the full biosynthetic potential of these microbes, studies towards the activation of cryptic BGCs are essential. Histone acetylation status is an important regulator of chromatin structure which impacts in cell physiology and, therefore, expression of biosynthetic gene clusters in filamentous fungi. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyl-transferases (HATs) are responsible for maintaining and controlling this process under different cell conditions. In this study, clr3, a gene encoding a histone deacetylase in Penicillium brasilianum was deleted and associated phenotypic and metabolic changes evaluated. Results indicate reduced growth under oxidative stress conditions in the {Delta}clr3 knockout strain. Also, the production of several secondary metabolites including austin-related meroterpenoids, brasiliamides, mycotoxins such as verruculogen and penicillic acid, as well as cyclodepsipeptides was reduced in the {Delta}clr3 strain when compared to wild-type strain. Accordingly, addition of epigenetic modulators responsible for HDAC inhibition such as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and nicotinamide (NAA) to P. brasilianum growth media also culminated in reduction of secondary metabolite production. Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) was applied to compare metabolite production and spatial distribution on the colony. Results suggest that Clr3 plays an important role in secondary metabolite biosynthesis in P. brasilianum, thus offering new strategies for regulation of natural product synthesis by assessing chromatin modification in P. brasilianum.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThis paper aims to show the scientific research and technological development trends of antineoplastics targeting PD-1/PD-L1 based on scientometrics and patentometrics.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsPublications and patents related to antineoplastics targeting PD-1/PD-L1were searched and collected from the Web of Science (WoS) and the Derwent Innovation Index (DII) respectively. Totally, 11244 publications and 5501 patents were obtained. The publications were analyzed from the annual number, the top countries/regions and organizations to describe the scientific research trends in this field. The patents were analyzed from the annual number, the top priority countries and patent assignees to reveal the characteristics and status of technological development. As well as the identification of scientific research focus and technological development focus was based on the title and abstract of the publications and patents, using the freely available computer program VOSviewer for clustering and visualization analysis. The number of scientific publications and patent applications showed obvious increase of 29.84% and 33.46% in recent ten years (2009-2018), respectively. Results suggested that the most productive countries/regions publishing on antineoplastics targeting PD-1/PD-L1 were USA and China, and the top three productive organizations were all from USA, including Harvard University, VA Boston Healthcare System (VA BHS) and University Of California System. There were four scientific research focus: (1) immune escape mechanism, (2) biomarkers related to efficacy and prognosis, (3) immune-related adverse event, and (4) drug design and preparation, and five technological development focus: (1) testing methods and apparatus, (2) indications related to carcinoma, (3) biomarkers related to diagnosis and prognosis, (4) small molecule inhibitors, and (5) indications other than carcinoma.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThe results of this study presents an overview of the characteristics of research status and trends of antineoplastics targeting PD-1/PD-L1, which could help readers broaden innovative ideas and discover new technological opportunities, and also serve as important indicators for government policymaking.",

    "abstract": "Prions are self-replicative protein particles lacking nucleic acids. Originally discovered for causing infectious neurodegenerative disorders, they have also been found to play several physiological roles in a variety of species. Functional and pathogenic prions share a common mechanism of replication, characterized by the ability of an amyloid conformer to propagate by inducing the conversion of its physiological, soluble counterpart. In this work, we focus on the propagation of the prion forming domain of HET-s, a physiological fungal prion for which high-resolution structural data are available. Since time-resolved biophysical experiments cannot yield a full reconstruction of prion replication, we resort to computational methods. To overcome the computational limitations of plain Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we adopt a special type of biased dynamics called ratchet-and-pawl MD (rMD). The accuracy of this enhanced path sampling protocol strongly depends on the choice of the collective variable (CV) used to define the biasing force. Since for prion propagation a reliable reaction coordinate (RC) is not yet available, we resort to the recently developed Self-Consistent Path Sampling (SCPS). Indeed, in such an approach the CV where the biasing force is applied is not heuristically postulated but is calculated through an iterative refinement procedure. Our atomistic reconstruction of the HET-s replication shows remarkable similarities with a previously reported mechanism of mammalian PrPSc propagation obtained with a different computational protocol. Together, these results indicate that the propagation of prions generated by evolutionary distant proteins shares common features. In particular, in both these cases, prions propagate their conformation through a very similar templating mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) multi-subunit signaling complex is highly conserved within eukaryotes. In fungi, STRIPAK controls multicellular development, morphogenesis, pathogenicity, and cell-cell recognition, while in humans, certain diseases are related to this signaling complex. To date, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation targets of STRIPAK are still widely unknown in microbial as well as animal systems. Here, we provide an extended global proteome and phosphoproteome study using the wild type as well as STRIPAK single and double deletion mutants from the filamentous fungus Sordaria macrospora. Notably, in the deletion mutants, we identified the differential phosphorylation of 129 proteins, of which 70 phosphorylation sites were previously unknown. Included in the list of STRIPAK targets are eight proteins with RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) including GUL1. Knockout mutants and complemented transformants clearly show that GUL1 affects hyphal growth and sexual development. To assess the role of GUL1 phosphorylation on fungal development, we constructed phospho-mimetic and -deficient mutants of GUL1 residues S180, S216, and S1343. While the S1343 mutants were indistinguishable from wildtype, phospho-deficiency of S180 and S216 resulted in a drastic reduction in hyphal growth and phospho-deficiency of S216 also affects sexual fertility. These results thus suggest that differential phosphorylation of GUL1 regulates developmental processes such as fruiting body maturation and hyphal morphogenesis. Moreover, genetic interaction studies provide strong evidence that GUL1 is not an integral subunit of STRIPAK. Finally, fluorescence microcopy revealed that GUL1 co-localizes with endosomal marker proteins and shuttles on endosomes. Here, we provide a new mechanistic model that explains how STRIPAK-dependent and - independent phosphorylation of GUL1 regulates sexual development and asexual growth.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn eukaryotes, the striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase (STRIPAK) multi-subunit signaling complex controls a variety of developmental processes, and the lack of single STRIPAK subunits is associated with severe developmental defects and diseases. However, in humans, animals, as well as fungal microbes, the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation targets of STRIPAK are still largely unknown. The filamentous fungus Sordaria macrospora is a well-established model system used to study the function of STRIPAK, since a collection of STRIPAK mutants is experimentally accessible. We previously established an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based proteomic and phosphoproteomic analysis to identify targets of STRIPAK. Here, we investigate mutants that lack one or two STRIPAK subunits. Our analysis resulted in the identification of 129 putative phosphorylation targets of STRIPAK including GUL1, a homolog of the RNA-binding protein SSD1 from yeast. Using fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that GUL1 shuttles on endosomes. We also investigated deletion, phospho-mimetic, and -deletion mutants and revealed that GUL1 regulates sexual and asexual development in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Collectively, our comprehensive genetic and cellular analysis provides new fundamental insights into the mechanism of how GUL1, as a STRIPAK target, controls multiple cellular functions.",

    "abstract": "Levels of protein translation by ribosomes are governed both by features of the translation machinery as well as sequence properties of the mRNAs themselves. We focus here on a striking three-nucleotide periodicity, characterized by overrepresentation of GCN codons and underrepresentation of G at the second position of codons, that is observed in Open Reading Frames (ORFs) of mRNAs. Our examination of mRNA sequences in Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that this periodicity is particularly pronounced in the initial codons--the ramp region--of ORFs of genes with high protein expression. It is also found in mRNA sequences immediately following non-standard AUG start sites, located upstream or downstream of the standard annotated start sites of genes. To explore the possible influences of the ramp GCN periodicity on translation efficiency, we tested edited ramps with accentuated or depressed periodicity in two test genes, SKN7 and HMT1. Greater conformance to (GCN)n was found to significantly depress translation, whereas disrupting conformance had neutral or positive effects on translation. Our recent Molecular Dynamics analysis of a subsystem of translocating ribosomes in yeast revealed an interaction surface that H-bonds to the +1 codon that is about to enter the ribosome decoding center A site. The surface, comprised of 16S/18S rRNA C1054 and A1196 (E. coli numbering) and R146 of ribosomal protein Rps3, preferentially interacts with GCN codons, and we hypothesize that modulation of this mRNA-ribosome interaction may underlie GCN-mediated regulation of protein translation. Integration of our expression studies with large-scale reporter studies of ramp sequence variants suggests a model in which the C1054-A1196-R146 (CAR) interaction surface can act as both an accelerator and braking system for ribosome translation.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has a zoonotic origin and was transmitted to humans via an undetermined intermediate host, leading to infections in humans and other mammals. To enter host cells, the viral spike protein (S-protein) binds to its receptor, ACE2, and is then processed by TMPRSS2. Whilst receptor binding contributes to the viral host range, S-protein:ACE2 complexes from other animals have not been investigated widely. To predict infection risks, we modelled S-protein:ACE2 complexes from 215 vertebrate species, calculated changes in the energy of the complex caused by mutations in each species, relative to human ACE2, and correlated these changes with COVID-19 infection data. We also analysed structural interactions to better understand the key residues contributing to affinity. We predict that mutations are more detrimental in ACE2 than TMPRSS2. Finally, we demonstrate phylogenetically that human SARS-CoV-2 strains have been isolated in animals. Our results suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can infect a broad range of mammals, but few fish, birds or reptiles. Susceptible animals could serve as reservoirs of the virus, necessitating careful ongoing animal management and surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Developing cultivars with superior performance in different cultivation environments is one of the main challenges of breeding programs. The current adaptability and stability analyses have limitations, especially when used with trials with genetic or statistical imbalances, heterogeneity of residual variances, and genetic covariance. Thus, adaptability and stability analyses based on mixed model approaches are an effective alternative in such cases. We propose a new methodology for genotypic adaptability and stability analyses, based on Legendre polynomials and genotype-ideotype distances aiming at greater precision when recommending cultivars. We applied the methodology to a set of common bean cultivars throughout a multi-environment trial. We used a set of 13 trials, where they were classified in unfavorable or favorable environments, depending on the average of the cultivars in these trials. The results showed that the methodology allows to predict the genotypic values of cultivars in environments where they were not evaluated with high accuracy values, therefore circumventing the imbalance of the experiments. From these values, it was possible to measure the genotypic adaptability according to ideotypes. The stability of the cultivars was quantified as the invariance of their behavior throughout the trials. The use of ideotypes based on real data allowed a better comparison of the performance of cultivars across environments.",

    "abstract": "The conserved O-GlcNAc transferase OGT O-GlcNAcylates serine and threonine residues of intracellular proteins to regulate their function. OGT is required for viability in mammalian cells, but its specific roles in cellular physiology are poorly understood. Here we describe a conserved requirement for OGT in an essential aspect of cell physiology: the hypertonic stress response. Through a forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered OGT is acutely required for osmoprotective protein expression and adaptation to hypertonic stress. Gene expression analysis shows that ogt-1 functions through a post-transcriptional mechanism. Human OGT partially rescues the C. elegans phenotypes, suggesting that the osmoregulatory functions of OGT are ancient. Intriguingly, mutations that ablate O-GlcNAcylation activity in either human or C. elegans OGT rescue the hypertonic stress response phenotype. Our findings are among the first to demonstrate a specific physiological role for OGT at the organismal level and demonstrate that OGT engages in important molecular functions outside of its well described roles in post-translational O-GlcNAcylation of intracellular proteins.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe ability to sense and adapt to changes in the environment is an essential feature of cellular life. Changes in environmental salt and water concentrations can rapidly cause cell volume swelling or shrinkage and, if left unchecked, will lead to cell and organismal death. All organisms have developed similar physiological strategies for maintaining cell volume. However, the molecular mechanisms that control these physiological outputs are not well understood in animals. Using unbiased genetic screening in C. elegans, we discovered that a highly conserved enzyme called O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) is essential for regulating physiological responses to increased environmental solute levels. A human form of OGT can functionally substitute for worm OGT, showing that this role is conserved across evolution. Surprisingly, the only known enzymatic activity of OGT was not required for this role, suggesting this enzyme has important undescribed molecular functions. Our studies reveal a new animal-specific role for OGT in the response to osmotic stress and show that C. elegans is an important model for defining the conserved molecular mechanisms that respond to alterations in cell volume.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria require high efficiency uptake systems to survive and proliferate in nutrient limiting environments, such as those found in the host. The ABC transporters at the bacterial plasma membrane provide a mechanism for transport of many substrates. We recently demonstrated that an AfuABC operon, previously annotated as encoding a ferrous iron uptake system, is in fact a cyclic hexose/heptose-phosphate transporter with high selectivity and specificity for these metabolites. In this study, we examine a second operon containing a periplasmic binding protein discovered in Actinobacillus for its potential role in nutrient acquisition. Using electron density obtained from the crystal structure of the periplasmic binding protein we modeled a pyridoxal-5-phosphate (P5P/PLP/Vitamin B6) ligand into the atomic resolution electron density map. The identity of the Vitamin B6 bound to this periplasmic binding protein was verified by isothermal titration calorimetry, microscale thermophoresis, and mass spectrometry, leading us to name the protein P5PA and the operon P5PAB. To illustrate the functional utility of this uptake system, we introduced the P5PAB operon from A. pleuropneumoniae into an E. coli K-12 strain that was devoid of a key enzyme required for Vitamin B6 synthesis. The growth of this strain at low levels of Vitamin B6 supports the role of this newly identify operon in Vitamin B6 uptake.",

    "abstract": "The core planar polarity proteins are essential mediators of tissue morphogenesis, controlling both the polarised production of cellular structures and polarised tissue movements. During development the core proteins promote planar polarisation by becoming asymmetrically localised to opposite cell edges within epithelial tissues, forming intercellular protein complexes that coordinate polarity between adjacent cells. Here we describe a novel protein complex that regulates the asymmetric localisation of the core proteins in the Drosophila pupal wing. DAnkrd49 (an ankyrin repeat protein) and Bride of Doubletime (Bdbt, a non-canonical FK506 binding protein family member) physically interact, and regulate each others levels in vivo. Loss of either protein results in a reduction in core protein asymmetry and disruption of the placement of trichomes at the distal edge of pupal wing cells. Post-translational modifications are thought to be important for the regulation of core protein behaviour and their sorting to opposite cell edges. Consistent with this, we find that loss of DAnkrd49 or Bdbt leads to reduced phosphorylation of the core protein Dishevelled and to decreased Dishevelled levels both at cell junctions and in the cytoplasm. Bdbt has previously been shown to regulate activity of the kinase Discs Overgrown (Dco, also known as Doubletime or Casein Kinase I{varepsilon}), and Dco itself has been implicated in regulating planar polarity by phosphorylating Dsh as well as the core protein Strabismus. We demonstrate that DAnkrd49 and Bdbt act as dominant suppressors of Dco activity. These findings support a model whereby Bdbt and DAnkrd49 act together to modulate the activity of Dco during planar polarity establishment.\n\nAuthor summaryIn many animal tissues, sheets of cells are polarised in the plane of the tissue, which is evident by the production of polarised structures, such as hairs on the fly wing that point in the same direction or cilia that beat in the same direction. One group of proteins controlling this coordinated polarity are the core planar polarity proteins, which localise asymmetrically within cells such that some core proteins localise to one cell end and others to the opposite cell end. It is thought that modifications such as phosphorylation may locally regulate core protein stability, and this promotes sorting of proteins to different cell ends. We identify two proteins, DAnkrd49 and Bdbt, that form a complex and regulate core protein asymmetry. Loss of either protein causes a reduction in overall levels of the core protein Dishevelled (Dsh), and a reduction in its phosphorylation. We provide evidence that the effect on core protein asymmetry is mediated via regulation of the kinase activity of Discs overgrown (Dco, also known as Doubletime/Casein Kinase I{varepsilon}) by DAnkrd49 and Bdbt. We propose that modulation of Dco activity by DAnkrd49 and Bdbt is a key step in the sorting of core proteins to opposite cell ends.",

    "abstract": "Pollen is the main food for honeybee broods and young workers and so colony development and reproduction rely heavily on pollen availability, both spatially and temporally, in the environment. Intensification of agriculture and climate seasonality are known to alter honeybee foraging patterns and pollen intake through changes in resource availability in temperate regions; however, little is known about how honeybees respond to such environmental factors in tropical regions.\n\nPollen species collected by honeybees in a Neotropical agricultural region of Colombia were identified. The effects of landscape structure (landscape Shannon Diversity Index, forest area in 1000 m around the apiary) and climate seasonality (mean monthly precipitation) on the amount, richness and diversity of pollen collected by the honeybees were evaluated for all pollen species together and pollen species segregated according to forest and anthropic areas (croplands, grasslands, woodlands, urban areas).\n\nHoneybees were found to be much more associated with anthropic than forest pollen species regardless of landscape structure or precipitation. However, the amount, richness and diversity of pollen from all species and forest species responded positively to landscape diversity and forest area, suggesting an advantage for honeybees in obtaining small quantities of pollen from forest species, in spite of being well-adapted to forage in anthropic areas. Precipitation was found not to be related to the overall amount and overall richness of pollen collected by honeybees, suggesting that climate seasonality was not an important factor for pollen foraging. Nonetheless, overall pollen diversity was negatively affected by precipitation in less diverse landscapes, while anthropic pollen diversity was negatively affected in more forested landscapes. These findings are compared with those from temperate regions, and the implications for honeybee productivity and survival, and their interactions with Neotropical native species, are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic intracellular organelles critical for lipid metabolism. Dynamic alterations in the configurations and functions of LDs during innate immune response to bacterial infections and the underlying mechanisms however, remain largely unknown. Herein, we trace the time-course morphology of LDs in fat bodies of Drosophila after transient bacterial infection. Detailed analysis shows that perilipin1 (plin1), a core gene regulating lipid metabolism of LDs is suppressed by IMD/Relish, an innate immune signaling. During immune activation, downregulated plin1 promotes the enlargement of LDs, which in turn alleviates immune reaction-associated reactive oxygen species (ROS) stress. Thus, the growth of LDs is likely an active adaptation to maintain redox homeostasis in response to IMD activation. Therefore, our study provides evidence that plin1 serves as a modulator on LDs reconfiguration in regulating infection-induced pathogenesis, and Plin1 might be a potential therapeutic target for coordinating inflammation resolution and lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD) caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons are accompanied by movement disorders, including tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and akinesia. Non-human primate (NHP) models with PD play an essential role in the analysis of PD pathophysiology and behavior symptoms. As impairments of hand dexterity function can affect activities of daily living in patients with PD, research on hand dexterity function in NHP models with chronic PD is essential. Traditional rating scales previously used in the evaluation of animal spontaneous behavior were insufficient due to factors related to subjectivity and passivity. Thus, experimentally designed applications for an appropriate apparatus are necessary. In this study, we aimed to longitudinally assess hand dexterity function using hand dexterity task (HDT) in NHP-PD models. To validate this assessment, we analyzed an alteration in Parkinsonian tremor symptoms, loss of dopaminergic neuron, and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of dopamine transporters (DAT) in these models. HDT latency significantly increased in NHP-PD models. In addition, a significant inverse correlation between HDT and DAT was identified, but no local bias was found. The correlation with intention tremor symptoms was lower than the resting tremor. In conclusion, the evaluation of HDT may reflect behavioral symptoms of NHP-PD models. Furthermore, HDT was effectively used to experimentally distinguish intention tremors from other tremors.",

    "abstract": "Spiking information of individual neurons is essential for functional and behavioral analysis in neuroscience research. Calcium imaging techniques are generally employed to obtain activities of neuronal populations. However, these techniques result in slowly-varying fluorescence signals with low temporal resolution. Estimating the temporal positions of the neuronal action potentials from these signals is a challenging problem. In the literature, several generative model-based and data-driven algorithms have been studied with varied levels of success. This article proposes a neural network-based signal-to-signal conversion approach, where it takes as input raw-fluorescence signal and learns to estimate the spike information in an end-to-end fashion. Theoretically, the proposed approach formulates the spike estimation as a single channel source separation problem with unknown mixing conditions. The source corresponding to the action potentials at a lower resolution is estimated at the output. Experimental studies on the spikefinder challenge dataset show that the proposed signal-to-signal conversion approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art-methods in terms of Pearsons correlation coefficient and Spearmans rank correlation coefficient and yields comparable performance for the area under the receiver operating characteristics measure. We also show that the resulting system: (a) has low complexity with respect to existing supervised approaches and is reproducible; (b) is layer-wise interpretable; and (c) has the capability to generalize across different calcium indicators.\n\nAuthor summaryInformation processing by a population of neurons is studied using two-photon calcium imaging techniques. A neuronal spike results in an increased intracellular calcium concentration. Fluorescent calcium indicators change their brightness upon a change in the calcium concentration, and this change is captured in the imaging technique. The task of estimating the actual spike positions from the brightness variations is formally referred to as spike estimation. Several signal processing and machine learning-based algorithms have been proposed in the past to solve this problem. However, the task is still far from being solved. Here we present a novel neural network-based data-driven algorithm for spike estimation. Our method takes the fluorescence recording as the input and synthesizes the spike information signal, which is well-correlated with the actual spike positions. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard evaluation framework. We further analyze different components of the model and discuss its benefits.",

    "abstract": "Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2), a member of the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), mediates neutrophil migration, a response that has been linked to {beta}-arrestin recruitment. {beta}-Arrestin regulates GPCR endocytosis and can also elicit non-canonical receptor signaling. To determine the poorly understood role of {beta}-arrestin in FPR2 endocytosis and in NADPH-oxidase activation in neutrophils, Barbadin was used as a research tool in this study. Barbadin has been shown to bind the clathrin adaptor protein (AP2) and thereby prevent {beta}- arrestin/AP2 interaction and {beta}-arrestin-mediated GPCR endocytosis. In agreement with this, AP2/{beta}-arrestin interaction induced by an FPR2-specific agonist was inhibited by Barbadin. Unexpectedly, however, Barbadin did not inhibit FPR2 endocytosis, indicating that a mechanism independent of {beta}-arrestin/AP2 interaction may sustain FPR2 endocytosis. This was confirmed by the fact, that FPR2 also underwent agonist-promoted endocytosis in {beta}-arrestin deficient cells, albeit at a diminished level as compared to wild type cells. Dissection of the Barbadin effects on FPR2-mediated neutrophil functions including NADPH-oxidase activation mediated release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and chemotaxis reveled that Barbadin had no effect on chemotactic migration whereas the release of ROS was potentiated/primed. The effect of Barbadin on ROS production was reversible, independent of {beta}-arrestin recruitment, and similar to that induced by latrunculin A. Taken together, our data demonstrate that endocytic uptake of FPR2 occurs independently of {beta}-arrestin, while Barbadin selectively augments FPR2-mediated neutrophil ROS production independently of receptor endocytosis. Given that Barbadin binds to AP2 and prevents the AP2/{beta}-arrestin interaction, our results indicate a role for AP2 in FPR2-mediated ROS release from human neutrophils.",

Nearly seven thousand publications, which comprise the entirety of retractions visible through PubMed as of August 2019, were used. This work involved sophisticated data collection and analysis techniques to use data from PubMed, Wikipedia, and WikiData, and study it with respect to the above mentioned axes. Importantly, I employ state-of-the-art analysis and visualization techniques from natural language processing (NLP) to understand the topics in retracted literature. To highlight a few results, the analyses demonstrate an increasing rate of retraction over time and noticeable differences in the publication quality (as measured by journal impact factor) among top countries. Moreover, while molecular biology and cancer dominate retractions, we also see a number of retractions not related to biology. The methods and results of this study can be applied to continuously understand the nature and evolution of retractions in life sciences, thus contributing to the health of this research ecosystem.",

Here, we demonstrated that MutS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa associates with primed DNA replication substrates. The predicted structure of this MutS-DNA complex revealed a new DNA binding site, in which Asn 279 and Arg 272 appeared to directly interact with the 3-OH terminus of primed DNA. Mutation of these residues resulted in a noticeable defect in the interaction of MutS with replication DNA substrates. Remarkably, MutS interaction with a mismatch within primed DNA induced a compaction of the protein structure and impaired the formation of an ATP-bound sliding clamp.

    "abstract": "Cell vertices in epithelia comprise specialized tricellular junctions (TCJs) that seal the paracellular space between three adjoining cells [1, 2]. Although TCJs play fundamental roles in tissue homeostasis, pathogen defense, and in sensing tension and cell shape [3-5], how they are assembled, maintained and remodeled is poorly understood. In Drosophila the transmembrane proteins Anakonda (Aka [6]) and Gliotactin (Gli [7]) are TCJ components essential for epithelial barrier formation. Additionally, the conserved four-transmembrane-domain protein M6, the only myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) family member in Drosophila, localizes to TCJs [8, 9]. PLPs associate with cholesterol-rich membrane domains and induce filopodia formation [10, 11] and membrane curvature [12], and Drosophila M6 acts as a tumor suppressor [8], but its role in TCJ formation remained unknown. Here we show that M6 is essential for the assembly of tricellular, but not bicellular occluding junctions, and for barrier function in embryonic epithelia. M6 and Aka localize to TCJs in a mutually dependent manner and are jointly required for TCJ localization of Gli, whereas Aka and M6 localize to TCJs independently of Gli. Aka acts instructively and is sufficient to direct M6 to cell vertices in the absence of septate junctions, while M6 is required permissively to maintain Aka at TCJs. Furthermore, M6 and Aka are mutually dependent for their accumulation in a low-mobility pool at TCJs. These findings suggest a hierarchical model for TCJ assembly, where Aka and M6 promote TCJ formation through synergistic interactions that demarcate a distinct plasma membrane microdomain at cell vertices.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhile significant advances have been made in uncovering the aetiology of Alzheimers disease and related dementias at the genetic level, molecular events at the epigenetic level remain largely undefined. Emerging evidence indicates that small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) and their associated RNA modifications are important regulators of complex physiological and pathological processes, including aging, stress responses, and epigenetic inheritance. However, whether small RNAs and their modifications are altered in dementia is not known.\n\nMethodsWe performed LC-MS/MS-based, high-throughput assays of small RNA modifications in post-mortem samples of the prefrontal lobe cortices of Alzheimers disease (AD) and control individuals. We noted that some of the AD patients has co-occurring vascular cognitive impairment-related pathology (VaD).\n\nFindingsWe report altered small RNA modifications in AD samples compared with normal controls. The 15-25-nucleotide (nt) RNA fraction of these samples was enriched for microRNAs, whereas the 30-40-nt RNA fraction was enriched for tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs), rRNA-derived small RNAs (rsRNAs), and YRNA-derived small RNAs (ysRNAs). Interestingly, most of these altered RNA modifications were detected both in the AD and AD with co-occurring vascular dementia subjects. In addition, sequencing of small RNA in the 30-40-nt fraction from AD cortices revealed reductions in rsRNA-5S, tsRNA-Tyr, and tsRNA-Arg.\n\nInterpretationThese data suggest that sncRNAs and their associated modifications are novel signals that may be linked to the pathogenesis and development of Alzheimers disease.\n\nFundingNIH grants (R01HL122770, R01HL091905, 1P20GM130459, R01HD092431, P50HD098593, GM103440), AHA grant (17IRG33370128), Sigmund Gestetner Foundation Fellowship to P Kehoe.\n\nResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSAlzheimers disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) are marked by cognitive impairment and neuropathologies caused by significant neuronal death. Associated gene mutations are rare in subjects with dementia, and the aetiology of these diseases is still not completely understood. Recent emerging evidence suggests that epigenetic changes are risk factors for the development of dementia. However, studies assessing small RNA modifications--one of the features of epigenetics--in dementia are lacking.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe used high-throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and small RNA sequencing to profile small RNA modifications and the composition of small RNAs in post-mortem samples of the prefrontal cortex of AD and control subjects. We detected and quantified 16 types of RNA modifications and identified distinct small non-coding RNAs and modification signatures in AD subjects compared with controls.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThis study identified novel types and compositions of small RNA modifications in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients compared with control subjects in post-mortem samples. The cellular locations of these RNA modifications and whether they are drivers or outcomes of AD are still not known. However, results from the present study may open new possibilities for dissecting the dementia pathology.",

In the context of the intestinal tract, brush border microvilli drive functions that are critical for physiological homeostasis, including nutrient uptake and host defense. However, cytoskeletal mechanisms that regulate the assembly and morphology of these protrusions are poorly understood. The parallel actin bundles that support microvilli have their pointed-end rootlets anchored in a highly crosslinked filamentous meshwork referred to as the \"terminal web\". Although classic EM studies revealed complex ultrastructure, the composition, organization, and function of the terminal web remains unclear. Here, we identify non-muscle myosin-2C (NM2C) as a major component of the brush border terminal web. NM2C is found in a dense, isotropic layer of puncta across the sub-apical domain, which transects the rootlets of microvillar actin bundles. Puncta in this network are separated by [~]210 nm, dimensions that are comparable to the expected size of filaments formed by NM2C. In primary intestinal organoid cultures, the terminal web NM2C network is highly dynamic and exhibits continuous remodeling. Using pharmacological and genetic perturbations to disrupt NM2C activity in cultured intestinal epithelial cells, we found that this motor controls the length of growing microvilli by regulating actin turnover in a manner that requires a fully active motor domain. Our findings answer a decades old question on the function of terminal web myosin and hold broad implications for understanding apical morphogenesis in diverse epithelial systems.",

    "abstract": "Recently submitted 784 SARS-nCoV2 whole genome sequences from NCBI Virus database were taken for constructing phylogenetic tree to look into their similarities. Pakistani strain MT240479 (Gilgit1-Pak) was found in close proximity to MT184913 (CruiseA-USA), while the second Pakistani strain MT262993 (Manga-Pak) was neighboring to MT039887 (WI-USA) strain in the constructed cladogram in this article. Afterward, four whole genome SARS-nCoV2 strain sequences were taken for variant calling analysis, those who appeared nearest relative in the earlier cladogram constructed a week time ago. Among those two Pakistani strains each of 29,836 bases were compared against MT263429 from (WI-USA) of 29,889 bases and MT259229 (Wuhan-China) of 29,864 bases. We identified 31 variants in both Pakistani strains, (Manga-Pak vs USA=2del+7SNPs, Manga-Pak vs Chinese=2del+2SNPs, Gilgit1-Pak vs USA=10SNPs, Gilgit1-Pak vs Chinese=8SNPs), which caused alteration in ORF1ab, ORF1a and N genes with having functions of viral replication and translation, host innate immunity and viral capsid formation respectively. These novel variants are assumed to be liable for low mortality rate in Pakistan with 385 as compared to USA with 63,871 and China with 4,633 deaths by May 01, 2020. However functional effects of these variants need further confirmatory studies. Moreover, mutated N & ORF1a proteins in Pakistani strains were also analyzed by 3D structure modelling, which give another dimension of comparing these alterations at amino acid level. In a nutshell, these novel variants are assumed to be linked with reduced mortality of COVID-19 in Pakistan along with other influencing factors, these novel variants would also be useful to understand the virulence of this virus and to develop indigenous vaccines and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic of SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has motivated an intensive analysis of its molecular epidemiology following its worldwide spread. To understand the early evolutionary events following its emergence, a dataset of 985 complete SARS-CoV-2 sequences was assembled. Variants showed a mean 5.5-9.5 nucleotide differences from each other, commensurate with a mid-range coronavirus substitution rate of 3x10-4 substitutions/site/year. Almost half of sequence changes were C->U transitions with an 8-fold base frequency normalised directional asymmetry between C->U and U->C substitutions. Elevated ratios were observed in other recently emerged coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) and to a decreasing degree in other human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, -OC43, -229E and -HKU1) proportionate to their increasing divergence. C->U transitions underpinned almost half of the amino acid differences between SARS-CoV-2 variants, and occurred preferentially in both 5U/A and 3U/A flanking sequence contexts comparable to favoured motifs of human APOBEC3 proteins. Marked base asymmetries observed in non-pandemic human coronaviruses (U>>A>G>>C) and low G+C contents may represent long term effects of prolonged C->U hypermutation in their hosts.\n\nImportanceThe evidence that much of sequence change in SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses may be driven by a host APOBEC-like editing process has profound implications for understanding their short and long term evolution. Repeated cycles of mutation and reversion in favoured mutational hotspots and the widespread occurrence of amino acid changes with no adaptive value for the virus represents a quite different paradigm of virus sequence change from neutral and Darwinian evolutionary frameworks that are typically used in molecular epidemiology investigations.",

To gain insight into pathological mechanisms and lay the potential groundwork for developing targeted therapies, we characterized the neurophysiologic and cell-type-specific transcriptomic consequences of a mouse model of HNRNPU haploinsufficiency. Heterozygous mutants demonstrated neuroanatomical abnormalities, global developmental delay, impaired ultrasonic vocalizations and increased seizure susceptibility, thus modeling aspects of the human disease. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of hippocampal and neocortical cells revealed widespread, yet modest, dysregulation of gene expression across mutant neuronal subtypes. We observed an increased burden of differentially-expressed genes in mutant excitatory neurons of the subiculum--a region of the hippocampus implicated in temporal lobe epilepsy. Evaluation of transcriptomic signature reversal as a therapeutic strategy highlights the potential importance of generating cell-type-specific signatures. Overall, this work provides insight into HNRNPU-mediated disease mechanisms, and provides a framework for using single-cell RNA-sequencing to study transcriptional regulators implicated in disease.",

    "abstract": "Prohibitin is an evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed protein in eukaryocyte. It mediate many important roles in cell survival, apoptosis, autophagy and senescence. In the present study, we aimed to explore the role of prohibitin in cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced apoptosis of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). For this purpose, HPMECs were trasfected with prohibitin and challenged with CSE. Our results showed that CSE exposure inhibited prohibitin expression in a dose-dependent manner in HPMECs. Overexpression of prohibitin could protect cell from CSE-induced injury by inhibiting CSE-induced cell apoptosis, inhibiting reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, increase mitochondrial membrane potential, increase the content of mitochondrial transcription factor A (mtTFA), IKK/{beta} phosphorylation and I{kappa}B- degradation. CSE decreases prohibitin expression in endothelial cells and restoration of prohibitin expression in these cells can protect against the deleterious effects of CSE on mitochondrial and cells. We identified prohibitin is a novel regulator of endothelial cell apoptosis and survival in the context of cigarette smoke exposure.",

The development of the optimal combinatorial or sequential approach is hindered by the lack of comprehensive data regarding TKI-induced immunomodulation and its kinetics. Through the use of orthogonal transcriptomic and phenotyping platforms combined with functional analytic pipelines, we demonstrated that the anti-angiogenic TKI pazopanib induces a dramatic and coherent reshaping of systemic immunity in mRCC patients, downsizing the myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) compartment in favor of a strong enhancement of cytotoxic T and Natural Killer (NK) cell effector functions. The intratumoral expression level of a MDSC signature here generated was strongly associated with poor prognosis in mRCC patients. The marked but transient nature of this immunomodulation, peaking at the 3rd month of treatment, provides the rationale for the use of TKIs as a preconditioning strategy to improve the efficacy of ICB.",

    "abstract": "Wind-driven upwelling followed by relaxation results in cycles of cold nutrient-rich water fueling intense phytoplankton blooms followed by nutrient-depletion, bloom decline, and sinking of cells. Surviving cells at depth can then be vertically transported back to the surface with upwelled waters to seed another bloom. As a result of these cycles, phytoplankton communities in upwelling regions are transported through a wide range of light and nutrient conditions. Diatoms appear to be well-suited for these cycles, but their responses to them remain understudied. To investigate the bases for diatoms ecological success in upwelling environments, we employed laboratory simulations of a complete upwelling cycle with a common diatom, Chaetoceros decipiens, and coccolithophore, Emiliania huxleyi. We show that while both organisms exhibited physiological and transcriptomic plasticity, the diatom displayed a distinct response enabling it to rapidly shift-up growth rates and nitrate assimilation when returned to light and available nutrients following dark, nutrient-deplete conditions. As observed in natural diatom communities, C. decipiens highly expresses before upwelling, or frontloads, key transcriptional and nitrate assimilation genes coordinating its rapid response to upwelling conditions. Low iron simulations showed that C. decipiens is capable of maintaining this response when iron is limiting to growth, whereas E. huxleyi is not. Differential expression between iron treatments further revealed specific genes used by each organism under low iron availability. Overall, these results highlight the responses of two dominant phytoplankton groups to upwelling cycles, providing insight into the mechanisms fueling diatom blooms during upwelling events.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPreviously, we identified missense mutations in CCNF that are causative of familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). CCNF encodes for the protein cyclin F, a substrate recognition component of the E3-ubiquitin ligase, SCFcyclin F. We have previously shown that mutations in CCNF cause disruptions to overall protein homeostasis; causing a build-up of ubiquitylated proteins (1) as well as defects in autophagic machinery (2).\n\nMethodsHere, we have used an unbiased proteomic screening workflow using BioID, as well as standard immunoprecipitations to identify novel interaction partners of cyclin F, identifying the interaction between cyclin F and a series of paraspeckle proteins. The homeostasis of these new cyclin F interaction partners, RBM14, NONO and SFPQ were monitored in primary neurons using immunoblotting. In addition, the homeostasis of RBM14 was compared between control and ALS/FTD patient tissue using standard IHC studies.\n\nResultsUsing BioID, we found over 100 putative interaction partners of cyclin F and demonstrated that cyclin F closely associates with a number of essential paraspeckle proteins, which are stress-responsive proteins that have recently been implicated in ALS pathogenesis. We further demonstrate that the turnover of these novel binding partners are defective when cyclin F carries an ALS/FTD-causing mutation. In addition the analysis of RBM14 levels in ALS patient post-mortem tissue revealed that RBM14 levels were significantly reduced in post-mortem ALS patient motor cortex and significantly reduced in the neurons of spinal cord tissue.\n\nConclusionOverall, our data demonstrate that the dysregulation of paraspeckle components may be contributing factors to the molecular pathogenesis of ALS/FTD.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPreviously, we identified missense mutations in CCNF that are linked to Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/Frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD) and have shown that a single mutation in cyclin F can cause defects to major protein degradation systems in dividing cells.\nC_LIO_LICyclin F has very few known interaction partners, many of which have roles in cell cycle progression. Accordingly, we used BioID and mass spectrometry to identify novel binding partners of cyclin F that may reveal insight into the role of cyclin F in neurodegeneration.\nC_LIO_LIMass spectrometry and bioinformatic studies demonstrate that cyclin F interacts with several RNA binding proteins. This includes the essential paraspeckle proteins, RBM14. Notably, this interaction could be validated by standard immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting. Cyclin F could also be found to interact with a series of essential proteins which form the paraspeckle complex.\nC_LIO_LIWe further evaluated the effect of cyclin F(S621G) on the homeostasis of these novel interaction partners in primary neurons in response to a known paraspeckle inducer, MG132. Notably, we demonstrate significant defects in the homeostasis of RBM14 and SFPQ, but not NONO, when cyclin F carries an S621G mutation.\nC_LIO_LIUnlike other paraspeckle proteins, RBM14 levels have not previously been reported in the post-mortem brain and spinal cord of ALS patient post-mortem tissue. Here, we note significant defects in the homeostasis of RBM14 in the post-mortem tissue of ALS patients.\nC_LI",
