    "abstract": "The capacity of ectotherms to cope with rising temperatures associated with climate change is a significant conservation concern as the rate of warming is likely too fast for adaptation to occur in some populations. Transgenerational plasticity, if present, could potentially buffer some of the negative impacts of warming on future generations. We examined transgenerational plasticity in lake trout to assess their inter-generational potential to cope with anticipated warming. We acclimated adult lake trout to cold or warm temperatures for several months, then bred them to produce offspring from parents of matched and mismatched temperatures. At the fry stage, offspring were also acclimated to cold or warm temperatures and their thermal performance was assessed by measuring their critical thermal maximum and metabolic rate during an acute temperature challenge. Overall, transgenerational plasticity was evident: thermal performance of offspring reflected both maternal and paternal environmental conditions, and offspring performed better when their environment matched that of their parents. There was little variation in offspring critical thermal maximum or peak metabolic rate, although cold-acclimated offspring from warm-acclimated parents exhibited elevated standard metabolic rates, suggesting that transgenerational effects can be detrimental when parent and offspring environments mismatch. These results demonstrate both the occurrence and limitations of transgenerational plasticity in a coldwater salmonid in response to elevated temperature, as well as potential ecological risks associated with transgenerational plasticity when an environmental change experienced by the parents does not persist with the next generation.",

    "abstract": "Despite many attempts to introduce evolutionary models that permit substitutions that instantly alter more than one nucleotide in a codon, the prevailing wisdom remains that such changes are rare and generally negligible (or are reflective of non-biological artifacts, such as alignment errors), and codon models continue to posit that only single nucleotide change have non-zero rates. We develop and test a simple hierarchy of codon-substitution models with non-zero evolutionary rates for only one-nucleotide (1H), one- and two-nucleotide (2H), or any (3H) codon substitutions. Using 35,000 empirical alignments, we find widespread statistical support for multiple hits: 58% of alignments prefer models with 2H allowed, and 22% - with 3H allowed. Analyses of simulated data suggest that these results are not likely to be due to simple artifacts such as model misclassification or alignment errors. Further modeling revealed that synonymous codon island jumping among codons encoding serine, especially along short branches, contributes significantly to this 3H signal. While serine codons were prominently involved in multiple-hit substitutions, there were other common exchanges contributing to better model fit. It appears that a small subset of sites in most alignments have unusual evolutionary dynamics not well explained by existing model formalisms, and that commonly estimated quantities, such as dN/dS ratios may be biased by model misspecification. Our findings highlight the need for continued evaluation of assumptions underlying workhorse evolutionary models and subsequent evolutionary inference techniques. We provide a software implementation for evolutionary biologists to assess the potential impact of extra base hits in their data in the HyPhy package.",

    "abstract": "Cellular responses to environmental stress are frequently mediated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Here, we examined global RBP dynamics in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in response to glucose starvation and heat shock. Each stress induced rapid remodeling of the RNA-protein interactome, without corresponding changes in RBP abundance. Consistent with general translation shutdown, ribosomal proteins contacting the mRNA showed decreased RNA-association. Among translation components, RNA-association was most reduced for initiation factors involved in 40S scanning (eIF4A, eIF4B, and Ded1), indicating a common mechanism of translational repression. In unstressed cells, eIF4A, eIF4B, and Ded1 primarily targeted the 5'-ends of mRNAs. Following glucose withdrawal, 5-binding was abolished within 30sec, explaining the rapid translation shutdown, but mRNAs remained stable. Heat shock induced progressive loss of 5 RNA-binding by initiation factors over [~]16min. Translation shutoff provoked selective 5'-degradation of mRNAs encoding translation-related factors, mediated by Xrn1. These results reveal mechanisms underlying translational control of gene expression during stress.\n\nHighlightsA quantitative proteomic approach reveals rapid stress-induced changes in RNA-binding Translation shutdown is driven by loss of mRNA binding by scanning initiation factors eIF4B and Ded1 have key but separate roles in driving the stress response Heat shock invokes rapid RNA degradation by Xrn1, selective for translation machinery",

    "abstract": "How junctional proteins regulate the mechanics of the plasma membrane and how actin and myosin isoforms are selectively localized at epithelial cell-cell junctions is poorly understood. Here we show by atomic force indentation microscopy, immunofluorescence analysis and FLIM membrane tension imaging that the tight junction (TJ) protein cingulin maintains apical surface stiffness and TJ membrane tortuosity and down-regulates apico-lateral membrane tension in MDCK cells. KO of cingulin in MDCK, mCCD and Eph4 cells results in a decrease in the juxta-membrane accumulation of labeling for cytoplasmic myosin-2B (NM2B), {gamma}-actin, phalloidin and ARHGEF18, but no detectable effect on myosin-2A (NM2A) and {beta}-actin. Loss of paracingulin leads to weaker mechanical phenotypes in MDCK cells, correlating with no detectable effect on the junctional accumulation of myosins and actins. Cingulin and paracingulin form biomolecular condensates, bind to the ZU5 domain of ZO-1, and are recruited as clients into ZO-1 condensates in a ZU5-dependent manner. Cingulin binding to ZO-1 promotes the unfolding of ZO-1, as determined by interaction with DbpA in cells lacking ZO-2 and in vitro. Cingulin promotes the accumulation of a pool of ZO-1 at the TJ and is required in a ZU5-dependent manner for the recruitment of phalloidin-labelled actin filaments into ZO-1 condensates, suggesting that ZU5-cingulin interaction promotes ZO-1 interaction with actin filaments. Our results indicate that cingulin tethers the juxta-membrane and apical branched {gamma}-actin-NM2B network to TJ to modulate ZO-1 conformation and the TJ assembly of a pool of ZO-1 and fine-tune the distribution of forces to apical and TJ membranes.",

    "abstract": "O_LIA time-consuming challenge faced by camera trap practitioners all over the world is the extraction of meaningful data from images to inform ecological management. The primary methods of image processing used by practitioners includes manual analysis and citizen science. An increasingly popular alternative is automated image classification software. However, most automated solutions are not sufficiently robust to be deployed on a large scale. Key challenges include limited access to images for each species and lack of location invariance when transferring models between sites. This prevents optimal use of ecological data and results in significant expenditure of time and resources to annotate and retrain deep learning models.\nC_LIO_LIIn this study, we aimed to (a) assess the value of publicly available non-iconic FlickR images in the training of deep learning models for camera trap object detection, (b) develop an out-of-the-box location invariant automated camera trap image processing solution for ecologist using deep transfer learning and (c) explore the use of small subsets of camera trap images in optimisation of a FlickR trained deep learning model for high precision ecological object detection.\nC_LIO_LIWe collected and annotated a dataset of images of \"pigs\" (Sus scrofa and Phacochoerus africanus) from the consumer image sharing website FlickR. These images were used to achieve transfer learning using a RetinaNet model in the task of object detection. We compared the performance of this model to the performance of models trained on combinations of camera trap images obtained from five different projects, each characterised by 5 different geographical regions. Furthermore, we explored optimisation of the FlickR model via infusion of small subsets of camera trap images to increase robustness in difficult images.\nC_LIO_LIIn most cases, the mean Average Precision (mAP) of the FlickR trained model when tested on out of sample camera trap sites (67.21-91.92%) was significantly higher than the mAP achieved by models trained on only one geographical location (4.42-90.8%) and rivalled the mAP of models trained on mixed camera trap datasets (68.96-92.75%). The infusion of camera trap images into the FlickR training further improved AP by 5.10-22.32% to 83.60-97.02%.\nC_LIO_LIEcology researchers can use FlickR images in the training of automated deep learning solutions for camera trap image processing to significantly reduce time and resource expenditure by allowing the development of location invariant, highly robust out-of-the-box solutions.

No vaccine to boost mucosal immunity or as a therapeutic has yet been developed to SARS-CoV-2. In this study we discover and characterize a cross-reactive human IgA monoclonal antibody, MAb362. MAb362 binds to both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins and competitively blocks hACE2 receptor binding, by completely overlapping the hACE2 structural binding epitope. Furthermore, MAb362 IgA neutralizes both pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in human epithelial cells expressing hACE2.

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a global testing supply shortage. In response, pooled testing has emerged as a promising strategy that can immediately increase testing capacity. Here, we provide support for the adoption of sample pooling with the point-of-care Cepheid Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 molecular assay. Corroborating previous findings, the Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay limit of detection was comparable to central laboratory reverse-transcription quantitative PCR tests with observed SARS-CoV-2 detection below 100 copies/mL. The Xpert(R) Xpress assay detected SARS-CoV-2 after samples with minimum viral loads of 461 copies/mL were diluted into six sample pools. Based on these data, we recommend the adoption of pooled testing with the Xpert(R) Xpress SARS-CoV-2 assay where warranted by population public health needs. The suggested number of samples per pool, or pooling depth, is unique for each point-of-care test site and should be determined by assessing positive test rates. To statistically determine appropriate pooling depth, we have calculated the pooling efficiency for numerous combinations of pool sizes and test rates. This information is included as a supplemental dataset that we encourage public health authorities to use as a guide to make recommendations that will maximize testing capacity and resource conservation.",

    "abstract": "To verify whether Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can form circRNA, the circRNA sequencing results of the HBV-positive HepG 2.2.15 hepatocarcinoma cell line were compared with the HBV genome. A novel circRNA, named as HBV_circ_1, was mapped to the 489-2985 nt region of the HBV genome (GenBank accession No. KU668446.1), which was derived from HBV pgRNA and has two junction sites. A partial fragment of the pgRNA (corresponding to HBV DNA genome 489-3,182-2,985nt) was resected and then connected to form a junction site of HBV_circ_1 (corresponding to HBV DNA genome 489/2985nt). The 5-terminal region (corresponding to HBV DNA genome 1,820-1,932nt) of pgRNA was repeated with the region of pgRNA at the 3-terminal region. Another junction site of HBV_circ_1 (corresponding to HBV DNA genome 1820nt) was formed in a manner similar to DNA homologous recombination mediated by repeats of pgRNA. Moreover, this RNA homologous recombination mediated by the repeats of pgRNA does not have tissue specificity and genus specificity. Reverse transcription PCR, northern blotting, and tissue in situ hybridization confirmed the existence of HBV_circ_1 in HepG2.2.15 cells and HBV related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissue. This study expands our understanding of circRNA generation mechanisms, and provide a new perspective for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of the virus.",

For revealing the underlying mechanism, we construct a mathematical model depicting the interactions among CD4+ regulatory T cells (Treg cells), CD4+ effect T cells (Teff cells) and IL-2 in SLE patients to simulate and reproduce the development of SLE. Through our analysis, one possible pathogenesis is that the activation point and deactivation point of Teff in SLE patients produced a forward shift compared to the normal Teff. According to our simulation, a therapeutic window existed in the treatment of lupus with exogenous IL-2, which means there is a strict limit to the dose of IL-2 in clinic. Finally, we study three different dosing strategies and reveal that specific dosing regimens can better exert the effects of IL-2 and relieve the possible side effect of high dose IL-2. It is possible to promote the study of autoimmune diseases through our efforts and assist the development of precision medical treatment.",

    "abstract": "Spiroplasma are wall-less bacteria which belong to the phylum Tenericutes that evolved from Firmicutes including Bacillus subtilis. Spiroplasma swim by a mechanism unrelated to widespread bacterial motilities, such as flagellar motility, and caused by helicity switching with kinks traveling along the helical cell body. The swimming force is likely generated by five classes of bacterial actin homolog MreBs (SMreBs 1-5) involved in the helical bone structure. We analyzed sequences of SMreBs to clarify their phylogeny and sequence features. The maximum likelihood method based on around 5,000 MreB sequences showed that the phylogenetic tree was divided into several radiations. SMreBs formed a clade adjacent to the radiation of MreBH, an MreB isoform of Firmicutes. Sequence comparisons of SMreBs and Bacillus MreBs were also performed to clarify the features of SMreB. Catalytic glutamic acid and threonine were substituted to aspartic acid and lysine, respectively, in SMreB3. In SMreBs 2 and 4, amino acids involved in inter- and intra-protofilament interactions were significantly different from those in Bacillus MreBs. A membrane-binding region was not identified in most SMreBs 1 and 4 unlike many walled-bacterial MreBs. SMreB5 had a significantly longer C-terminal region than the other MreBs, which possibly forms a protein-protein interaction. These features may support the functions responsible for the unique mechanism of Spiroplasma swimming.",

    "abstract": "The mechanics of fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix regulate cell physiology in a number of diseases, prompting efforts to elucidate cell mechanosensing mechanisms at the molecular and cellular scale. Here, the use of fibronectin-functionalized silicone elastomers that exhibit considerable frequency-dependence in viscoelastic properties unveiled the presence of two cellular processes that respond discreetly to substrate mechanical properties. Soft elastomers supported efficient focal adhesion maturation and fibroblast spreading due to an apparent stiff surface layer. However, soft elastomers did not enable cytoskeletal and fibroblast polarization; elastomers with high cross-linking and low deformability were required for polarization. The underlying reason for this behavior was the inability of soft elastomeric substrates to resist traction forces, rather than a lack of sufficient traction force generation; accordingly, mild inhibition of actomyosin contractility rescued fibroblast polarization even on the softer elastomers. Our findings help reconcile previously proposed local and global models of cell mechanosensing by demonstrating the differential dependence of substrate mechanics on distinct cellular processes.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe mechanisms cells employ to sense and respond to the mechanical properties of their surroundings remain incompletely understood. In this study we used a commercial silicone elastomer formulation to prepare compliant, fibronectin-coated substrates and investigate the adhesion and polarization of human fibroblasts. Our results suggest the existence of at least two discrete mechanosensing processes regulated at different time and length (force) scales. Focal adhesion assembly and cell spreading were promoted by a stiff surface layer independent from bulk viscoelasticity, whereas effective cell polarization required elevated elastomer stiffness, sufficient to resist applied cell traction. The results presented here have implications on the use of elastomeric substrates as biomaterials for mechanosensing studies or clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of a novel strain of betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has led to a pandemic that has been associated with hundreds of thousands of deaths. Research is ongoing around the world to create vaccines and therapies to minimise rates of disease spread and mortality. Crucial to these efforts are molecular characterisations of neutralising antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Such antibodies would be valuable for measuring vaccine efficacy, diagnosing exposure, and developing effective biotherapeutics. Here, we describe our new database, CoV-AbDab, which already contains data on over 380 published/patented antibodies and nanobodies known to bind to at least one betacoronavirus. This database is the first consolidation of antibodies known to bind SARS-CoV-2 and other betacoronaviruses such as SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV. We supply relevant metadata such as evidence of cross-neutralisation, antibody/nanobody origin, full variable domain sequence (where available) and germline assignments, epitope region, links to relevant PDB entries, homology models, and source literature. Our preliminary analysis exemplifies a spectrum of potential applications for the database, including identifying characteristic germline usage biases in receptor-binding domain antibodies and contextualising the diagnostic value of the SARS-CoV binding CDRH3s through comparison to over 500 million antibody sequences from SARS-CoV serologically naive individuals. Community submissions are invited to ensure CoV-AbDab is efficiently updated with the growing body of data analysing SARS-CoV-2.

    "abstract": "Polyploidy is present in many cancer types and is increasingly recognized as an important factor in promoting chromosomal instability, genome evolution, and heterogeneity in cancer cells. However, the mechanisms that trigger polyploidy in cancer cells are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the origin of polyploidy in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a highly heterogenous cancer, using a combination of genomics and cell biology approaches in EAC cell lines, organoids, and tumors. We found the EAC cells and organoids present specific mitotic defects consistent with problems in the attachment of chromosomes to the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. Time-lapse analyses confirmed that EAC cells have problems in congressing and aligning their chromosomes, which can ultimately culminate in mitotic slippage and polyploidy. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing, RNA-seq, and quantitative immunofluorescence analyses revealed alterations in the copy number, expression, and cellular distribution of several proteins known to be involved in the mechanics and regulation of chromosome dynamics during mitosis. Together, these results provide evidence that an imbalance in the amount of proteins implicated in the attachment of chromosomes to spindle microtubules is the molecular mechanism underlying mitotic slippage in EAC. Our findings that the likely origin of polyploidy in EAC is mitotic failure caused by problems in chromosomal attachments not only improves our understanding of cancer evolution and diversification, but may also aid in the classification and treatment of EAC and possibly other highly heterogeneous cancers.",

    "abstract": "The term micro-heterogeneity refers to non-genetic cell to cell variability observed in a bell-shaped distribution of the expression of a trait within a population. The contribution of micro-heterogeneity to physiology and pathology remains largely uncharacterised. To address such an issue, we investigated the impact of heterogeneity in skeletal muscle fibro/adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) isolated from an animal model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the mdx mouse. FAPs play an essential role in muscle homeostasis. However, in pathological conditions or ageing, they are the source of intramuscular infiltrations of fibrotic or adipose tissue. By applying a multiplex flow cytometry assay, we characterised and purified from mdx muscles two FAP cell states expressing different levels of SCA-1. The two cell states are morphologically identical and repopulate each other after several growth cycles. However, they differ in their in vitro behaviour. Cells expressing higher levels of SCA-1 (SCA1-High-FAPs) differentiate more readily into adipocytes while, when exposed to a fibrogenic stimulation, increase the expression of COL1A1 mRNA. In addition, SCA1-High-FAPs proliferate more extensively ex vivo and display more proliferating cells in dystrophic muscles. Adipogenesis of FAP cell states is inhibited in vitro by leukocytes from young dystrophic mice, while leukocytes isolated from aged dystrophic mice are less effective in limiting the adipogenesis of SCA1-High-FAPs suggesting a differential regulatory effect of the microenvironment on micro-heterogeneity. Our data suggest that FAP micro-heterogeneity is modulated in pathological conditions and that this heterogeneity in turn may impact on the behaviour of mesenchymal cells in genetic diseases.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Formaldehyde (FA) is a ubiquitous endogenous and environmental metabolite that is thought to exert cytotoxicity through DNA and DNA-protein crosslinking. We show here that FA can cause cellular damage beyond genotoxicity by triggering oxidative stress, which is prevented by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5/GSNOR). Mechanistically, we determine that endogenous FA reacts with the redox-active thiol group of glutathione (GSH) forming S-hydroxymethyl-GSH, which is metabolized by ADH5 yielding reduced GSH thus preventing redox disruption. We identify the ADH5-ortholog gene in Caenorhabditis elegans and show that oxidative stress also underlies FA toxicity in nematodes. Moreover, we show that endogenous GSH can protect cells lacking the Fanconi Anemia DNA repair pathway from FA, which might have broad implications for Fanconi Anemia patients and for healthy BRCA2-mutation carriers. We thus establish a highly conserved mechanism through which endogenous FA disrupts the GSH-regulated cellular redox homeostasis that is critical during development and aging.",

    "abstract": "Phagocytes engulf unwanted particles into phagosomes that then fuse with lysosomes to degrade the enclosed particles. Ultimately, phagosomes must be recycled to help recover membrane resources that were consumed during phagocytosis and phagosome maturation, a process referred to as phagosome resolution. Little is known about phagosome resolution, which may proceed through exocytosis or membrane fission. Here, we show that bacteria-containing phagolysosomes in macrophages undergo fragmentation through vesicle budding, tubulation, and constriction. Phagosome fragmentation requires cargo degradation, the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons, and clathrin. We provide evidence that lysosome reformation occurs during phagosome resolution since the majority of phagosome-derived vesicles displayed lysosomal properties. Importantly, we show that clathrin-dependent phagosome resolution is important to maintain the degradative capacity of macrophages challenged with two waves of phagocytosis. Overall, our work suggests that phagosome resolution contributes to lysosome recovery and to maintain the degradative power of macrophages to handle multiple waves of phagocytosis.\n\nSummaryPhagocytes engulf particles into phagolysosomes for degradation. However, the ultimate fate of phagolysosomes is undefined. Lancaster, Fountain et al. show that phagosomes fragment to reform lysosomes in a clathrin-dependent manner. This process helps maintain the degradative capacity of phagocytes for subsequent rounds of phagocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic environmental degradation has led to an increase in the frequency and prevalence of aquatic hypoxia (low dissolved-oxygen concentration, DO), which may affect habitat quality for water-breathing fishes. The weakly electric black ghost knifefish, Apteronotus albifrons, is typically found in well-oxygenated freshwater habitats in South America. Using a shuttle-box design, we exposed juvenile A. albifrons to a stepwise decline in DO from normoxia (>95% air saturation) to extreme hypoxia (10% air saturation) in one compartment and chronic normoxia in the other. Below 22% air saturation, A. albifrons actively avoided the hypoxic compartment. Hypoxia avoidance was correlated with upregulated swimming activity. Following avoidance, fish regularly ventured back briefly into deep hypoxia. Hypoxia did not affect the frequency of their electric organ discharges. Our results show that A. albifrons is able to sense hypoxia at non-lethal levels and uses active avoidance to mitigate its adverse effects.\n\nSummaryThe weakly electric knifefish, Apteronotus albifrons, avoids hypoxia below 22% air saturation. Avoidance correlates with increased swimming activity, but not with a change in electric organ discharge frequency.",

Here we have systematically investigated the preparation of three macromolecular complexes using three different vitrification devices (Vitrobot, chameleon and a time-resolved cryoEM device) on various timescales, including grids made within 6 ms, (the fastest reported to date), to interrogate particle behaviour at the air-water interface for different timepoints. Results demonstrate that different macromolecular complexes can respond to the thin film environment formed during cryoEM sample preparation in highly variable ways, shedding light on why cryoEM sample preparation can be difficult to optimise.

    "abstract": "Several related human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are endemic in the human population, causing mild respiratory infections1. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is a recent zoonotic infection that has quickly reached pandemic proportions2,3. Zoonotic introduction of novel coronaviruses is thought to occur in the absence of pre-existing immunity in the target human population. Using diverse assays for detection of antibodies reactive with the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, we demonstrate the presence of pre-existing humoral immunity in uninfected and unexposed humans to the new coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive antibodies were readily detectable by a sensitive flow cytometry-based method in SARS-CoV-2-uninfected individuals and were particularly prevalent in children and adolescents. These were predominantly of the IgG class and targeted the S2 subunit. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced higher titres of SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive IgG antibodies, targeting both the S1 and S2 subunits, as well as concomitant IgM and IgA antibodies, lasting throughout the observation period of 6 weeks since symptoms onset. SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor sera also variably reacted with SARS-CoV-2 S and nucleoprotein (N), but not with the S1 subunit or the receptor binding domain (RBD) of S on standard enzyme immunoassays. Notably, SARS-CoV-2-uninfected donor sera exhibited specific neutralising activity against SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotypes, according to levels of SARS-CoV-2 S-binding IgG and with efficiencies comparable to those of COVID-19 patient sera. Distinguishing pre-existing and de novo antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 will be critical for our understanding of susceptibility to and the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Changes in trabecular micro-architecture are key to our understanding of osteoporosis. Previous work focusing on structure model index (SMI) measurements have concluded that disease progression entails a shift from plates to rods in trabecular bone, but SMI is heavily biased by bone volume fraction. As an alternative to SMI, we proposed the Ellipsoid Factor (EF) as a continuous measure of local trabecular shape between plate-like and rod-like extremes. We investigated the relationship between EF distributions, SMI and bone volume fraction of the trabecular geometry in a murine model of disuse osteoporosis as well as from human vertebrae of differing bone volume fraction. We observed a moderate shift in EF median (at later disease stages in mouse tibia) and EF mode (in the vertebral samples with low bone volume fraction) towards a more rod-like geometry, but not in EF maximum and minimum. These results support the notion that the plate to rod transition does not coincide with the onset of bone loss and is considerably more moderate, when it does occur, than SMI suggests. A variety of local shapes not straightforward to categorise as rod or plate exist in all our trabecular bone samples.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a fundamental catabolic process essential for development, homeostasis and proper immune function 1. During autophagy, a cascade of ATG proteins target intracellular cargoes for lysosomal degradation and recycling 2. This pathway utilises a unique post-translational modification, the conjugation of ATG8 proteins to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) at autophagosomes, which modulates cargo selection and maturation. ATG8 lipidation also occurs during non-canonical autophagy, a parallel pathway involving Single Membrane ATG8 Conjugation (SMAC) to endolysosomal compartments, which plays a key role in phagocytosis and other processes 3. It has been widely assumed that SMAC involves the same lipidation of ATG8 to PE, but this has yet to be formally tested. Here, we show that ATG8 undergoes alternative lipidation to phosphatidylserine (PS) during non-canonical autophagy/SMAC. Using mass spectrometry, we find that activation of SMAC, by pharmacological agents 4,5, or during non-canonical autophagy processes such as LC3-associated phagocytosis 6,7 and Influenza A virus infection 8, induces the covalent conjugation of ATG8 to PS, as well as PE. This alternative lipidation event is dependent on the ATG16L1 WD40 domain, and occurs at PS enriched endolysosomal membranes. Importantly, we find that the ATG8-PS and ATG8-PE adducts are differentially delipidated by isoforms of the ATG4 family, indicating significant molecular distinctions and mechanisms between these two species.\n\nTogether, these results provide an important new insight into autophagy signalling, revealing an alternative form of the hallmark ATG8-lipidation event, so widely used to define and assay autophagy. Furthermore, ATG8-PS lipidation provides a specific  molecular signature for non-canonical autophagy, uncovering a novel means of detecting and monitoring this emerging pathway.",

    "abstract": "ARHGAP36 is a Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) family member that contributes to spinal cord development and tumorigenesis. This multidomain protein is composed of splicing-dependent N-terminal sequences, the GAP-like region, and a unique C-terminal domain, and an N-terminal arginine-rich region has been shown to suppress protein kinase A (PKA) and activate Gli transcription factors. To understand how these structural elements act in concert, we have mapped the ARHGAP36 structure-activity landscape with domain- and amino-acid-level resolution. ARHGAP36-mediated Gli activation can be repressed by N-terminal sequences that regulate subcellular ARHGAP36 localization and PKA targeting. The GAP-like and C-terminal domains counteract this autoinhibitory mechanism and promote ARHGAP36 trafficking to the plasma membrane and primary cilium, respectively. The GAP-like domain may also conditionally suppress the arginine-rich region, and it modulates ARHGAP36 binding to the prolyl oligopeptidase-like protein PREPL and the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRAJA2. These domain-dependent activities provide a potential means for tissue-specific ARHGAP36 functions.",

Cxcl10-/- mice had the same viremia as wild-type animals, but fewer immune infiltrates and lower viral loads in footpads at the peak of arthritic disease (6-8 days post infection). Macrophages constituted the largest immune cell population in footpads following infection, which were significantly reduced in Cxcl10-/- mice. The viral RNA loads in neutrophils and macrophages were reduced in Cxcl10-/- compared to wild-type mice.

    "abstract": "BackgroundMorbidity and mortality from COVID-19 caused by novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is accelerating worldwide and novel clinical presentations of COVID-19 are often reported. The range of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, its potential receptors and associated regulating factors are still largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID-19.\n\nMethodsWe performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA-Seq databases to study gene expression and co-expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and plasmablasts. We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID-19 risk factor status.\n\nResultsACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA and PPIB), CD26 (DPP4) and related molecules were expressed in both, epithelium and in immune cells. We also observed a distinct age-related expression profile of these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults. Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL or blood. Additionally, CD147-related genes correlated positively with age and BMI. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis.\n\nConclusionsOur data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells. Altered expression of these receptors related with age, gender, obesity and smoking, as well as with the disease status might contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and severity patterns.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) is essential to viral replication and cleaves highly specific substrate sequences, making it an obvious target for inhibitor design. However, as for any virus, SARS-CoV-2 is subject to constant selection pressure, with new Mpro mutations arising over time. Identification and structural characterization of Mpro variants is thus critical for robust inhibitor design. Here we report sequence analysis, structure predictions, and molecular modeling for seventy-nine Mpro variants, constituting all clinically observed mutations in this protein as of April 29, 2020. Residue substitution is widely distributed, with some tendency toward larger and more hydrophobic residues. Modeling and protein structure network analysis suggest differences in cohesion and active site flexibility, revealing patterns in viral evolution that have relevance for drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that exposure to chronically induced intraocular pressure (IOP) leads to neurodegenerative changes in the inner retina. This study aimed to determine retinal proteomic alterations in a rat model of glaucoma and compared findings with human retinal proteomics changes in glaucoma reported previously. We developed an experimental glaucoma rat model by subjecting the rats to increased IOP (9.3{+/-}0.1 vs 20.8{+/-}1.6 mm Hg) by weekly microbead injections into the eye (8 weeks). The retinal tissues were harvested from control and glaucomatous eyes and protein expression changes analysed using multiplexed quantitative proteomics approach. Immunofluorescence was performed for selected protein markers for data validation. Our study identified 4304 proteins in the rat retinas. Out of these, 139 proteins were downregulated ([&le;]0.83) while expression of 109 proteins was upregulated ([&ge;]1.2-fold change) under glaucoma conditions (p[&le;]0.05). Computational analysis revealed reduced expression of proteins associated with glutathione metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction/oxidative phosphorylation, cytoskeleton and actin filament organisation, along with increased expression coagulation cascade, apoptosis, oxidative stress and RNA processing markers. Further functional network analysis highlighted the differential modulation of nuclear receptor signalling, cellular survival, protein synthesis, transport and cellular assembly pathways. Alterations in crystallin family, glutathione metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction associated proteins shared similarities between the animal model of glaucoma and the human disease condition. In contrast, the activation of the classical complement pathway and upregulation of cholesterol transport proteins, were exclusive to the human glaucoma. These findings provide insights into the neurodegenerative mechanisms that are specifically affected in the retina in response to chronically elevated IOP.",

    "abstract": "The sensitivity to volatile carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by humans and other animals is a critical component in the host preference behaviors of the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles coluzzii. The molecular receptors responsible for the ability to sense CO2 are encoded by three putative gustatory receptor (Gr) genes (Gr22,23,24) which are expressed in a distinctive array of sensory neurons housed in maxillary palp capitate peg sensilla of An. coluzzii. Despite the identification of these components and subsequent studies, there is a paucity of understanding regarding the respective roles of these three GRs in the mosquitos CO2 transduction process. To address this, we have used CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing techniques combined with in vivo electrophysiological recordings to directly examine the role of Gr22,23,24 in detecting CO2 in An. coluzzii. These studies reveal that both Gr23 and Gr24 are absolutely required to maintain in vivo CO2 sensitivity while, in contrast, Gr22 knock out mutants are still able to respond to CO2 stimuli albeit with significantly weaker sensitivity. Our data supports a model in which Gr22 plays a modulatory role to enhance the functionality of Gr23/24 complexes that are responsible for CO2 sensitivity of mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "Denitrifying phosphorus removal is a cost and energy efficient treatment technology that relies on polyphosphate accumulating organisms (DPAOs) utilizing nitrate or nitrite as terminal electron acceptor. Denitrification is a multistep process and many organisms do not possess the complete pathway, leading to the accumulation of intermediates such as nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas and ozone depleting substance. Candidatus Accumulibacter organisms are prevalent in denitrifying phosphorus removal processes and, according to genomic analyses, appear to vary in their denitrification abilities based on their lineage. Yet, denitrification kinetics and nitrous oxide accumulation by Accumulibacter after long-term exposure to either nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptor have never been compared. We investigated the preferential use of the nitrogen oxides involved in denitrification and nitrous oxide accumulation in two enrichments of Accumulibacter and a competitor - the glycogen accumulating organism Candidatus Competibacter. A metabolic model was modified to predict phosphorus removal and denitrification rates when nitrate, nitrite or N2O were added as electron acceptors in different combinations. Unlike previous studies, no N2O accumulation was observed for Accumulibacter in the presence of multiple electron acceptors. Electron competition did not affect denitrification kinetics or N2O accumulation in Accumulibacter or Competibacter. Despite the presence of sufficient internal storage polymers (polyhydroxyalkanoates, or PHA) as energy source for each denitrification step, the extent of denitrification observed was dependent on the dominant organism in the enrichment. Accumulibacter showed complete denitrification and N2O utilization, whereas for Competibacter denitrification was limited to reduction of nitrate to nitrite. These findings indicate that DPAOs can contribute to lowering N2O emissions in the presence of multiple electron acceptors under partial nitritation conditions.",

    "abstract": "SummaryCircadian (approximately daily) rhythms are a pervasive property of mammalian cells, tissues, and behaviour, ensuring physiological and metabolic adaptation to solar time. Models of daily cellular timekeeping revolve around transcriptional feedback repression, whereby CLOCK and BMAL1 activate the expression of  clock proteins PERIOD (PER) and CRYPTOCHROME (CRY), which in turn repress CLOCK/BMAL1 activity. CRY proteins are thus considered essential negative regulators of the oscillation; a function supported by behavioural arrhythmicity of CRY-deficient mice when kept under constant conditions. Challenging this interpretation, however, we find evidence for persistent circadian rhythms in mouse behaviour and cellular PER2 levels when CRY is absent. CRY-less oscillations are variable in their expression and have a shorter period than wild type controls. Importantly, we find classic circadian hallmarks such as temperature compensation and determination of period by casein kinase 1{delta}/{varepsilon} activity to be maintained. In the absence of CRY-mediated transcriptional feedback repression and rhythmic Per2 transcription, PER2 protein rhythms are sustained for several cycles, accompanied by circadian variation in protein stability. We suggest that, whereas circadian transcriptional feedback imparts robustness and functionality onto biological clocks, the core timekeeping mechanism is post-translational. Our findings suggest that PER proteins normally act as signalling hubs that transduce timing information to the nucleus, imparting daily rhythms upon the activity of transcriptional effectors.\n\nHighlights[tpltrtarr] PER/CRY-mediated negative feedback is dispensable for mammalian circadian timekeeping\n[tpltrtarr]Circadian variation in PER2 levels persists in the absence of rhythmic Per2 transcription\n[tpltrtarr]CK1 and GSK3 are plausible mechanistic components of a  cytoscillator mechanism\n[tpltrtarr]CRY-mediated feedback repression imparts robustness to biological timekeeping\n\n\nIn briefCircadian turnover of mammalian clock protein PERIOD2 persists in the absence of canonical transcriptional feedback repression and rhythmic clock gene activity, demanding a re-evaluation of cellular clock function and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Background Anosmia is a frequent symptom in patients with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) driven by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and mostly recovers within weeks. This clinical figure is significantly different from that of anosmia after upper respiratory infection, which occurs in only a small proportion of patients and does not recover or requires months to recover. The background mechanisms of COVID-19 induced olfactory dysfunction have not been elucidated.Methods To address the unique pathophysiology of olfactory dysfunction associated with COVID-19, we examined the existence and distribution of ACE2 (virus binding receptor), TMPRSS2 and Furin (proteases to facilitate virus entry) in the nasal mucosa, composed of the respiratory mucosa (RM) and olfactory mucosa (OM), and the olfactory bulb (OB) in mouse and human tissues by immunohistochemistry and gene analyses.Results Ace2, Tmprss2, and Furin gene expressions were confirmed in the nasal mucosa and OB. ACE2 was widely expressed all in the RM, OM and OB. Co-expression of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and Furin was observed in the RM including the RE and subepithelial glands and in the OM, especially in the supporting cells on the olfactory epithelium and the Bowman\u2019s glands. Notably, the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) in the OM were positive for ACE2 but almost negative for TMPRSS2 and Furin. The cells in the OB expressed ACE2 strongly and Furin weakly and did not express TMPRSS2.Conclusions ACE2 was widely expressed in the RM, OM and OB, but TMPRSS2 and Furin were expressed in certain types of cells and were absent in the ORNs. These findings, together with clinically reported ones, suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural and central dysfunction and, to some extent, conductive olfactory dysfunction. That the ORNs express ACE2 but not TMPRSS2 or Furin may explain the early recovery of anosmia.Short Summary Protein expression patterns of ACE2, TMPRSS, and Furin suggest that COVID-19 related anosmia can occur due to mainly sensorineural dysfunction without olfactory neuronal damage.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Here, we reported that serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase1 (SGK1) is activated by administering a chronic high-fat diet (HFD), which increases the risk of T2DM, and thus promotes Tau pathology via the phosphorylation of tau at Ser214 and the activation of a key tau kinase, namely, GSK-3{beta}, forming SGK1-GSK-3{beta}-tau complex. SGK1 was activated under conditions of elevated glucocorticoid and hyperglycemia associated with HFD, but not of fatty acid-mediated insulin resistance. Elevated expression of SGK1 in the mouse hippocampus led to neurodegeneration and impairments in learning and memory. Upregulation and activation of SGK1, SGK1-GSK-3{beta}-tau complex were also observed in the hippocampi of AD cases. Our results suggest that SGK1 is a key modifier of tau pathology in AD, linking AD to corticosteroid effects and T2DM.",

    "abstract": "MotivationWith an increasing number of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models being created and subsequently sequenced to study tumor heterogeneity and to guide therapy decisions, there is a similarly increasing need for methods to separate reads originating from the graft (human) tumor and reads originating from the host species (mouse) surrounding tissue. Two kinds of methods are in use: On the one hand, alignment-based tools require that reads are mapped and aligned (by an external mapper/aligner) to the host and graft genomes separately first; the tool itself then processes the resulting alignments and quality metrics (typically BAM files) to assign each read or read pair. On the other hand, alignment-free tools work directly on the raw read data (typically FASTQ files). Recent studies compare different approaches and tools, with varying results.\n\nResultsWe show that alignment-free methods for xenograft sorting are superior concerning CPU time usage and equivalent in accuracy. We improve upon the state of the art sorting by presenting a fast lightweight approach based on three-way bucketed quotiented Cuckoo hashing. Our hash table requires memory comparable to an FM index typically used for read alignment and less than other alignment-free approaches. It allows extremely fast lookups and uses less CPU time than other alignment-free methods and alignment-based methods at similar accuracy.\n\nAvailabilityOur software xengsort is available under the MIT license at http://gitlab.com/genomeinformatics/xengsort. It is written in numba-compiled Python and comes with Snakemake workflows for hash table construction and dataset processing.\n\nContactSven.Rahmann@uni-due.de",

Optimal configurations of sensors give better representations of the process of interest, maximising its exploration while minimising the need for costly infrastructure. By modelling the monitored process, we can identify gaps in its representation, i.e. uncertain predictions, where additional sensors should be located. Here, with data collected from the Rothamsted Insect Survey network, we train an artificial neural network to predict the seasonal aphid arrival from environmental variables. We focus on estimating prediction uncertainty across the UK to guide the addition of a sensor to the network. We first illustrate how to estimate uncertainty in neural networks, hence making them relevant for model-based monitoring network optimisation. Then we highlight critical areas of agricultural importance where additional traps would improve decision support and crop protection in the UK. Possible applications include most ecological monitoring and surveillance activities, but also the weather or pollution monitoring.",

    "abstract": "The functions carried out by macrophages are essential in the processes of repairing skin injury. However, the mechanism of the M2 macrophage and its role in cutaneous wound healing remain elusive. B cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31) plays an important role in the immune system, and its function in connection with macrophages has yet to be determined. The present study demonstrates that the process of cutaneous wound healing slowed down in bone marrow-specific BAP31 knock down Lyz2-cre-BAP31flox/flox mice. In addition, further studies show that various kinds of macrophage M2 polarization related factors were regulated by BAP31. Among these molecules C/EBP {beta} was significantly affected. However, IL-4 but not IFN-{gamma}, is able to recover the expression levels of C/EBP {beta} and its downstream transcript factors induced by BAP31. Then, we demonstrated that BAP31 regulated macrophage M2 polarization by negative regulation of IL-4R and positive influence on Egr-2 to affect C/EBP {beta}. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism of BAP31 in regulating M2 macrophage, and provide novel targets for the prevention and treatment of chronic wounds.",

    "abstract": "Visual field defects in chronic hemianopia can improve through visual restitution training, yet not all patients benefit equally from this long and exhaustive process. Here, we asked if resting-state functional connectivity prior to visual restitution could predict training success. In two training sessions of eight weeks each, 20 patients with chronic hemianopia performed a visual discrimination task by directing spatial attention towards stimuli presented in either hemifield, while suppressing eye movements. We examined two effects: a sensitivity change in the attended (trained) minus the unattended (control) hemifield (i.e., a training-specific improvement), and an overall improvement (i.e., a total change in sensitivity after both sessions). We then identified five visual resting-state networks and evaluated their functional connectivity in relation to both training effects. We found that the functional connectivity strength between the anterior Precuneus and the Occipital Pole Network was positively related to the attention modulated (i.e., training-specific) improvement. No such relationship was found for the overall improvement or for the other visual networks of interest. Our finding suggests that the anterior Precuneus plays a role in training-induced visual field improvements. The resting-state functional connectivity between the anterior Precuneus and the Occipital Pole Network may thus serve as an imaging-based biomarker that quantifies a patients potential capacity to direct spatial attention. This may help to identify hemianopia patients that are most likely to benefit from visual restitution training.",

    "abstract": "The ribosomal RNA-encoding gene (rDNA) has a characteristic genomic nature: tens to thousands of copies in a genome, tandemly repeated structure, and intragenomic sequence homogeneity. These features contribute to ribosome productivity via physiological and evolutionary processes. We reported previously the exceptional absence of these features in the model arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. Here we examine the phylogenetic distribution of the exceptional rDNA features in the genus Rhizophagus via improving the genome sequence of R. clarus. Cross-species comparison indicated similarity of their rDNAs not only in the genomic features but also in the distribution of intragenomic polymorphic sites on the paralogs. Ribosomal RNA comprises multiple domains with different functions. The two Rhizophagus species commonly exhibited a variation enrichment site, ES27L, which is related to translational fidelity and antibiotic sensitivity. Variation enrichment on ES27L has not been observed in other organisms lacking the three rDNA features such as malaria parasites and Cyanidioschyzon merolae. Expression profiling of rDNAs in R. irregularis revealed that rDNA paralogs are expressed differently in association with host plant species. Our results suggest a broad distribution of the disarranged rDNA across AM fungi and its involvement in the successful association with the broad range of host species.",

Critical to their development is a deeper understanding of cross-neutralizing antibody responses induced by natural human coronavirus (HCoV) infections. Here, we mined the memory B cell repertoire of a convalescent SARS donor and identified 200 SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies that target multiple conserved sites on the spike (S) protein. A large proportion of the antibodies display high levels of somatic hypermutation and cross-react with circulating HCoVs, suggesting recall of pre-existing memory B cells (MBCs) elicited by prior HCoV infections. Several antibodies potently cross-neutralize SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and the bat SARS-like virus WIV1 by blocking receptor attachment and inducing S1 shedding. These antibodies represent promising candidates for therapeutic intervention and reveal a new target for the rational design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.",

When formulated with Alhydrogel\u00ae, RBD219-N1 induced high-level neutralizing antibodies against both pseudotyped virus and a clinical (mouse-adapted) isolate of SARS-CoV. Here, we report that mice immunized with RBD219-N1/Alhydrogel\u00ae were fully protected from lethal SARS-CoV challenge (0% mortality), compared to \u223c 30% mortality in mice when immunized with the SARS S protein formulated with Alhydrogel\u00ae, and 100% mortality in negative controls.

Specifically, a formulation with a 1:25 ratio of RBD219-N1 to Alhydrogel\u00ae provided high neutralizing antibody titers, 100% protection with non-detectable viral loads with minimal or no eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates. As a result, this vaccine formulation is under consideration for further development against SARS-CoV and potentially other emerging and re-emerging beta-CoVs such as SARS-CoV-2.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "We present an approach to investigate SARS-CoV-2 virus sequences based on alignment-free methods for RNA sequence comparison. In particular, we verify a given clustering result for the GISAID data set, which was obtained analyzing the molecular differences in coronavirus populations by phylogenetic trees. For this purpose, we use alignment-free dissimilarity measures for sequences and combine them with learning vector quantization classifiers for virus type discriminant analysis and classification. Those vector quantizers belong to the class of interpretable machine learning methods, which, on the one hand side provide additional knowledge about the classification decisions like discriminant feature correlations, and on the other hand can be equipped with a reject option. This option gives the model the property of self controlled evidence if applied to new data, i.e. the models refuses to make a classification decision, if the model evidence for the presented data is not given. After training such a classifier for the GISAID data set, we apply the obtained classifier model to another but unlabeled SARS-CoV-2 virus data set. On the one hand side, this allows us to assign new sequences to already known virus types and, on the other hand, the rejected sequences allow speculations about new virus types with respect to nucleotide base mutations in the viral sequences.\n\nAuthor summaryThe currently emerging global disease COVID-19 caused by novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses requires all scientific effort to investigate the development of the viral epidemy, the properties of the virus and its types. Investigations of the virus sequence are of special interest. Frequently, those are based on mathematical/statistical analysis. However, machine learning methods represent a promising alternative, if one focuses on interpretable models, i.e. those that do not act as black-boxes. Doing so, we apply variants of Learning Vector Quantizers to analyze the SARS-CoV-2 sequences. We encoded the sequences and compared them in their numerical representations to avoid the computationally costly comparison based on sequence alignments. Our resulting model is interpretable, robust, efficient, and has a self-controlling mechanism regarding the applicability to data. This framework was applied to two data sets concerning SARS-CoV-2. We were able to verify previously published virus type findings for one of the data sets by training our model to accurately identify the virus type of sequences. For sequences without virus type information (second data set), our trained model can predict them. Thereby, we observe a new scattered spreading of the sequences in the data space which probably is caused by mutations in the viral sequences.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal protein aggregation within neurons is a key pathologic feature of Parkinsons disease (PD). The spread of protein aggregates in the brain is associated with clinical disease progression, but how this occurs remains unclear. Mutations in the gene glucosidase, beta acid 1 (GBA), which encodes the lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are the most penetrant common genetic risk factor for PD and dementia with Lewy bodies, and also associate with faster disease progression. To explore the mechanism by which mutations in GBA influence pathogenesis of these diseases, we previously created a Drosophila model of GBA deficiency (Gba1b) that manifests neurodegeneration, motor and cognitive deficits, and accelerated protein aggregation. Proteomic analysis of Gba1b mutants revealed dysregulation of proteins involved in extracellular vesicle (EV) biology, and we found altered protein composition of EVs from Gba1b mutants. To further investigate this novel mechanism, we hypothesized that GBA may influence the spread of pathogenic protein aggregates throughout the brain via EVs. We found that protein aggregation is reduced cell-autonomously and non-cell-autonomously by expressing wildtype GCase in specific tissues. In particular, accumulation of insoluble ubiquitinated proteins and Ref(2)P in the brains of Gba1b flies are reduced by ectopic expression of GCase in muscle tissue. Neuronal expression of GCase also cell-autonomously rescued protein aggregation in brain as well as non-cell-autonomously rescued protein aggregation in muscle. Muscle-specific GBA expression rescued the elevated levels of EV-intrinsic proteins and Ref(2)P found in EVs from Gba1b flies. Genetically perturbing EV biogenesis in specific tissues in the absence of GCase revealed differential cell-autonomous effects on protein aggregation but could not replicate the non-cell-autonomous rescue observed with tissue-specific GBA expression. Additionally, we identified ectopically expressed GCase within isolated EVs. Together, our findings suggest that GCase deficiency mediates accelerated spread of protein aggregates between cells and tissues via dysregulated EVs, and EV-mediated trafficking of GCase may partially account for the reduction in aggregate spread.\n\nAuthors SummaryParkinsons disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease characterized by abnormal clumps of proteins (aggregates) within the brain and other tissues which can lead to cellular dysfunction and death. Mutations in the gene GBA, which encodes glucocerebrosidase (GCase), are the strongest genetic risk factor for PD, and are associated with faster disease progression. GCase-deficient mutant flies display features suggestive of PD including increased protein aggregation in brain and muscle. We found that restoring GCase protein in the muscle of mutant flies reduced protein aggregation in muscle and the brain, suggesting a mechanism involving interaction between tissues. Previous work indicated that GBA influences extracellular vesicles (EVs) - small membrane-bound structures released by cells to communicate and/or transport cargo from cell to cell. Here, we found increased aggregated proteins within EVs of mutant flies, which was reduced by restoring GCase in muscle. In addition, we found GCase within the EVs, possibly explaining how GCase in one tissue such as muscle could reduce protein aggregation in a distant tissue like the brain. Our findings suggest that GCase influences proteins within EVs, affecting the spread of protein aggregation. This may be important to understanding PD progression and could uncover new targets to slow neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, starting in 2019, has challenged the speed at which labs perform science, ranging from discoveries of the viral composition to handling health outcomes in humans. The small ~30kb single-stranded RNA genome of Coronaviruses makes them adept at cross species spread and drift, increasing their probability to cause pandemics. However, this small genome also allows for a robust understanding of all proteins coded by the virus. We employed protein modeling, molecular dynamic simulations, evolutionary mapping, and 3D printing to gain a full proteome and dynamicome understanding of SARS-CoV-2. The Viral Integrated Structural Evolution Dynamic Database (VIStEDD) has been established (prokoplab.com/vistedd), opening future discoveries and educational usage. In this paper, we highlight VIStEDD usage for nsp6, Nucleocapsid (N), and Spike (S) surface glycoprotein. For both nsp6 and N we reveal highly conserved surface amino acids that likely drive protein-protein interactions. In characterizing viral S protein, we have developed a quantitative dynamics cross correlation matrix insight into interaction with the ACE2/SLC6A19 dimer complex. From this quantitative matrix, we elucidated 47 potential functional missense variants from population genomic databases within ACE2/SLC6A19/TMPRSS2, warranting genomic enrichment analyses in SARS-CoV-2 patients. Moreover, these variants have ultralow frequency, but can exist as hemizygous in males for ACE2, which falls on the X-chromosome. Two noncoding variants (rs4646118 and rs143185769) found in ~9% of African descent individuals for ACE2 may regulate expression and be related to increased susceptibility of African Americans to SARS-CoV-2. This powerful database of SARS-CoV-2 can aid in research progress in the ongoing pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first identified in December 2019 and has quickly become a worldwide pandemic. In response, many diagnostic manufacturers have developed molecular assays for SARS-CoV-2 under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) pathway. This study compared three of these assays: the Hologic Panther Fusion SARS-CoV-2 assay (Fusion), the Hologic Aptima SARS-CoV-2 assay (Aptima) and the BioFire Diagnostics COVID-19 test (BioFire), to determine analytical and clinical performance, as well as workflow. All three assays showed a similar limit of detection (LOD) using inactivated virus, with 100% detection ranging from 500-1,000 genome equivalents/ml, whereas use of a quantified RNA transcript standard showed the same trend, but had values ranging from 62.5 to 125 copies/ml, confirming variability in absolute quantification of reference standards. The clinical correlation found that the Fusion and BioFire assays had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 98.7%, followed by the Aptima assay at 94.7% when compared to the consensus result. All three assays exhibited 100% negative percent agreement (NPA). Analysis of discordant results revealed that all four samples missed by the Aptima assay had Ct values >37 on the Fusion assay.\n\nIn conclusion, while all three assays showed similar relative LODs, we showed differences in absolute LODs depending on which standard was employed. In addition, the Fusion and BioFire assays showed better clinical performance, while the Aptima assay showed a modest decrease in overall PPA. These findings should be kept in mind when making platform testing decisions.",

Vessel skeleton density (VSD) and vessel diameter index (VDI) were calculated for each gas condition for the superficial retinal layer (SRL) and deep retinal layer (DRL). The superficial layer analysis excluded regions of arterioles and venules. Data analysis was performed using mixed factorial analysis of covariance stratified by diabetic status. All models were adjusted for age, gender, and hypertension.\n\nResultsAmong controls, there was a significant difference in capillary VSD between all gas conditions (p<0.001). This difference was present in both the SRL and DRL. Among diabetics, there was no significant difference in response to CO2 conditions in the SRL (p=0.072), and a blunted response to both CO2 and O2 in the DRL. A significant gas effect was detected in the capillary VDI in the SRL of controls (p=0.001), which was driven by higher VDI in the oxygen condition compared to that of carbon dioxide.\n\nConclusionsImpairment in RVR in diabetic subjects is driven largely by a decrease in the magnitude of the capillary response to O2 in the DRL as well as almost complete attenuation of capillary CO2 response in all layers. These layer and gas specific impairments in diabetics seem to occur early in the disease and to be driven primarily at the capillary level.",

Sediment, biofilms/mats, and inland water exhibited the most variation in community composition among geographic locations (beta-diversity). Within soils, agricultural lands, hot deserts, grasslands, and shrublands contained the highest richness, while forests, cold deserts, and tundra biomes consistently harbored fewer bacterial species. Surprisingly, agricultural soils encompassed similar levels of beta-diversity as other soil biomes. These patterns were robust to the alpha- and beta-diversity metrics used and the taxonomic binning approach. Overall, the results support the idea that spatial environmental heterogeneity is an important driver of bacterial diversity.",

    "abstract": "The immune system can recognize microbes and sterile tissue damage. Among the damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), uric acid is considered a major component which can trigger inflammation. It represents a breakpoint in the evolutionary history of humans as our ancestors lost the uricase gene, the enzyme responsible for its cleavage. High soluble uric acid (sUA) concentration is able to increase IL-1{beta} in murine, but not human macrophages. We observed that sUA increased the mRNA expression of Naip1 in murine macrophages, and, therefore, we hypothesized that the recognition of sUA can be made by a Naip1-Nlrp3 inflammasome platform. Additionally, we used genome-wide transcriptome analysis, functional analyses and structural modeling predictions and observed that virus-transduction of murine Naip1 into human macrophages induced IL-1{beta} after sUA stimulus, besides leading to fatty acid production and an inflammation-related response. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition and genetic loss of Nlrp3 led to decreased IL-1{beta} production upon sUA stimulus. Surface plasmon resonance and quartz crystal microbalance showed that sUA is able to interact with Naip1. Naip could be a lost receptor for sUA in the evolutionary process and a better understanding of the immune modulatory function of sUA could lead to design rational novel anti-hyperuricemic therapies.",

    "abstract": "Unicellular eukaryotes are an integral part of many microbial ecosystems communities where they are known to interact with their surrounding prokaryotic community - either as predators or as a mutualistic habitat. Within the rumen, one of the most complex host-associated microbial habitats, ciliate protozoa represent the main micro-eukaryotes, accounting for up to 50% of the microbial biomass. Nonetheless, the extent of the ecological effect of protozoa on the microbial community and on the rumen metabolic output remains largely understudied. To assess the role of protozoa on the rumen ecosystem, we established an ex-vivo system in which distinct protozoa sub-communities were introduced to native rumen prokaryotic community. We show that the different protozoa communities exert a strong and differential impact on the composition of the prokaryotic community, as well as its function including methane production. Furthermore, the presence of protozoa increases prokaryotic diversity with a differential effect on specific bacterial populations such as Gammaproteobacteria, Prevotella and Spirochetes. Our results suggest that protozoa mitigate the effect of competitive exclusion between bacterial species, thereby contributing to the maintenance of prokaryotic diversity in the rumen. Our findings put forward the rumen protozoa populations as potentially important ecosystem engineers for future microbiome modulation strategies.",

    "abstract": "Adenoviruses (AdVs) are prevalent and give rise to chronic and recurrent disease. The human AdV (HAdV) species B and C, such as HAdV-C2, C5 and B14, cause respiratory disease, and constitute a health threat for immuno-compromised individuals. HAdV-Cs are well known for lysing cells, owing to the E3 CR1-{beta}-encoded adenovirus death protein (ADP). We previously reported a high-throughput image-based screening framework and identified an inhibitor of HAdV-C2 multi-round infection, Nelfinavir Mesylate. Nelfinavir is the active ingredient of Viracept, an FDA-approved inhibitor of the human immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) aspartyl protease, and used to treat acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). It is not effective against single round HAdV infections. Here, we show that Nelfinavir inhibits the lytic cell-free transmission of HAdV, indicated by the suppression of comet-shaped infection foci in cell culture. Comet-shaped foci occur upon convection-based transmission of cell-free viral particles from an infected cell to neighbouring uninfected cells. HAdV lacking ADP was insensitive to Nelfinavir, but gave rise to comet-shaped foci indicating that ADP enhances but is not required for cell lysis. This was supported by the notion that HAdV-B14 and B14p1 lacking ADP were highly sensitive to Nelfinavir, although HAdV-A31, B3, B7, B11, B16, B21, D8, D30 or D37 were less sensitive. Conspicuously, Nelfinavir uncovered slow-growing round-shaped HAdV-C2 foci, independent of neutralizing antibodies in the medium, indicative of non-lytic cell-to-cell transmission. Our study demonstrates the repurposing potential of Nelfinavir with post-exposure efficacy against different HAdVs, and describes an alternative non-lytic cell-to-cell transmission mode of HAdV.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=181 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/098061v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (85K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8aa32corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dea943org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13aa2fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a23352_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Here, we describe SR7, a dual-function antisense RNA from the Bacillus subtilis chromosome. This RNA was earlier published as the SigB-dependent regulatory RNA S1136 and reported to reduce the amount of the small ribosomal subunit under ethanol stress. We found that the 5 portion of SR7 encodes a small protein composed of 39 amino acids which we designated SR7P. It is translated from a 185 nt SigB-dependent mRNA under five different stress conditions and a longer SigB-independent RNA constitutively. Two- to three-fold higher amounts of SR7P were detected in B. subtilis cells exposed to salt, ethanol or heat stress. Co-elution experiments with SR7PC-FLAG and Far-Western blotting demonstrated that SR7P interacts with the glycolytic enzyme enolase. Enolase is a scaffolding component of the B. subtilis degradosome where it interacts with RNase Y and phosphofructokinase PfkA. We found that SR7P increases the amount of RNase Y bound to enolase without affecting PfkA. RNA does not bridge the SR7P-enolase-RNase Y interaction. In vitro-degradation assays with the known RNase Y substrates yitJ and rpsO mRNA revealed enhanced enzymatic activity of enolase-bound RNase Y in the presence of SR7P. Northern blots showed a major effect of enolase and a minor effect of SR7P on the half-life of rpsO mRNA indicating a fine-tuning role of SR7P in RNA degradation. Moreover, SR7P impacts survival of B. subtilis under stress conditions. We suggest that the SR7P-dependent modification of the degradosome affects targets in different physiological pathways.",

    "abstract": "In vitro studies from transgenic Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis models have suggested an increased excitability of spinal motoneurones. However, in vivo intracellular recordings from adult ALS mice models have produced conflicting findings. Previous publications using barbiturate anaesthetised G93A SOD1 mice suggested that some motoneurones are hypo-excitable, defined by deficits in repetitive firing. Our own previous recordings in G127X SOD1 mice using different anaesthesia, however, showed no repetitive firing deficits, and increased persistent inward currents at symptom onset. These discrepancies may be due to differences between models, symptomatic stage, anaesthesia or technical differences. To investigate this, we repeated our original experiments, but in adult male G93A mice at both presymptomatic and symptomatic stages, under barbiturate anaesthesia.\n\nIn vivo intracellular recordings from antidromically identified spinal motoneurones revealed no significant differences in the ability to fire repetitively in the G93A SOD1 mice. Motoneurones in G93A SOD1 mice fired significantly more spontaneous action potentials. Rheobase was significantly lower and the input resistance and input-output gain were significantly higher in both presymptomatic and symptomatic G93A SOD1 mice. This was despite a significant increase in the duration of the post-spike after-hyperpolarisation (AHP) in both presymptomatic and symptomatic G93A SOD1 mice. Finally, evidence of increased activation of persistent inward currents was seen in both presymptomatic and symptomatic G93A SOD1 mice. Our results do not confirm previous reports of hypo-excitability of spinal motoneurones in the G93A SOD1 mouse and demonstrate that the motoneurones do in fact show an increased response to inputs.\n\nKey Point SummaryO_LIAlthough in vitro recordings using neonatal preparations from mouse models of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) suggest increased motoneurone excitability, in vivo recordings in adult ALS mouse models have been conflicting.\nC_LIO_LIIn adult G93A SOD1 models, spinal motoneurones have previously been shown to have deficits in repetitive firing, in contrast to the G127X SOD1 mouse model.\nC_LIO_LIOur in vivo intracellular recordings in barbiturate-anaesthetised adult male G93A SOD1 mice reveal no deficits in repetitive firing either prior to or after symptom onset.\nC_LIO_LIWe show that deficits in repetitive firing ability can be a consequence of experimental protocol and should not be used alone to classify otherwise normal motoneurones as hypo-excitable.\nC_LIO_LIMotoneurones in the G93A SOD1 mice showed an increased response to inputs, with lower rheobase, higher input-output gains and increased activation of persistent inward currents.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Fatty acid synthases (FASs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) iteratively elongate and often reduce two-carbon ketide units in de novo fatty acid and polyketide biosynthesis. Cycles of chain extensions in FAS and PKS are initiated by an acyltransferase (AT), which loads monomer units onto acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), small, flexible proteins that shuttle covalently linked intermediates between catalytic partners. Formation of productive ACP-AT interactions is required for catalysis and specificity within primary and secondary FAS and PKS pathways. Here, we use the Escherichia coli FAS AT, FabD, and its cognate ACP, AcpP, to interrogate type II FAS ACP-AT interactions. We utilize a covalent crosslinking probe to trap transient interactions between AcpP and FabD to elucidate the first x-ray crystal structure of a type II ACP-AT complex. Our structural data are supported using a combination of mutational, crosslinking, and kinetic analyses, and long timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Together, these complementary approaches reveal key catalytic features of FAS ACP-AT interactions. These mechanistic inferences suggest that AcpP adopts multiple, productive conformations at the AT binding interface, allowing the complex to sustain high transacylation rates. Furthermore, MD simulations support rigid body subdomain motions within the FabD structure that may play a key role in AT activity and substrate selectivity.\n\nSignificance StatementThe essential role of acyltransferases (ATs) in fatty acid synthase (FAS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) pathways, namely the selection and loading of starter and extender units onto acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), relies on catalytically productive ACP-AT interactions. Here, we describe and interrogate the first structure of a type II FAS malonyl-CoA:ACP-transacylase (MAT) in covalent complex with its cognate ACP. We combine structural, mutational, crosslinking and kinetic data with molecular dynamics simulations to describe a highly flexible and robust protein-protein interface, substrate-induced active site reorganization, and key subdomain motions that likely govern FAS function. These findings strengthen a mechanistic understanding of molecular recognitions between ACPs and partner enzymes and provide new insights for engineering AT-dependent biosynthetic pathways.",

    "abstract": "Evidence on the effectiveness of low-cost, sustainable biological vector control tools for Aedes mosquitoes is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this trial is to estimate the impact of guppy fish, in combination with the use of the larvicide Pyriproxyfen (Sumilarv(R) 2MR), and Communication for Behavioral Impact (COMBI) activities to reduce entomological indices in Cambodia.\n\nIn this cluster randomized, controlled superiority trial, 30 clusters comprising of one or more villages each (with approximately 170 households) will be allocated, in a 1:1:1 ratio, to receive either a) three interventions (guppies, Sumilarv(R) 2MR, and COMBI activities), b) two interventions (guppies and COMBI activities), or c) control (standard vector control).\n\nHouseholds were invited to participate, and entomology surveys among 40 randomly selected households per cluster were carried out quarterly. The primary outcome was the population density of adult female Aedes mosquitoes (i.e. number per house) trapped using adult resting collections. Secondary outcome measures include the House index, Container index, Breteau index, Pupae Per House, Pupae Per Person, mosquito infection rate, guppy fish coverage, Sumilarv(R) 2MR coverage, and percentage of respondents with knowledge about Aedes mosquitoes causing dengue. In the primary analysis, adult female Aedes density and mosquito infection rates was aggregated over follow-up time points to give a single rate per cluster. This was analyzed by negative binomial regression, yielding density ratios.\n\nThe number of Aedes females was reduced by roughly half compared to the control in both the guppy and PPF arm (Density Ratio (DR)=0.54 [95% CI 0.34-0.85], p=0.0073), and guppy arm (DR=0.49 [95% CI 0.31-0.77], p=0.0021). The extremely low cost of including guppy rearing in community-based health structures along with the effectiveness demonstrated suggest guppies should be considered as a vector control tool as long as the benefits outweigh any potential environmental concerns. PPF was also highly accepted and preferred over current vector control tools used in Cambodia, however product costs and availability are still unknown.\n\nAuthor SummaryDengue is one of the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral diseases in the world, is caused by bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes, and can sometimes lead to death. Cambodia has one of the highest per-capita incidence rates in Asia. Without a cure or routinely available efficacious vaccine, dengue control relies largely on reduction and avoidance of mosquitoes. In Cambodia, dengue mosquito control activities are focused on larviciding with temephos and pyrethroid based adulticide sprays to which Aedes have been shown to be increasingly resistant. This study was designed to evaluate novel biological vector control tools (guppy fish and a controlled release larvicidal matrix) utilizing an integrated vector management approach with community-based methods tailored to the local context. The results indicate that the tools resulted in a statistically significant reduction in immature and adult Aedes mosquito density. The interventions were accepted by and communities were willing to pay for them. The results suggest guppies are an ideal vector control tool as long as the benefits outweigh any potential environmental concerns. PPF was also highly accepted and preferred over current vector control tools used in Cambodia, however product costs and availability are still unknown.",

    "abstract": "In water, transparency seems an ideal concealment strategy, as testified by the variety of transparent aquatic organisms. By contrast, transparency is nearly absent on land, with the exception of insect wings, and knowledge is scarce about its functions and evolution, with fragmentary studies and no comparative perspective. Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) represent an outstanding group to investigate transparency on land, as species typically harbour opaque wings covered with coloured scales, a key multifunctional innovation. Yet, many Lepidoptera species have evolved partially or fully transparent wings. At the interface between physics and biology, the present study investigates transparency in 123 Lepidopteran species (from 31 families) for its structural basis, optical properties and biological relevance in relation to thermoregulation and vision. Our results establish that transparency has likely evolved multiple times independently. Efficiency at transmitting light is largely determined by clearwing microstructure (scale shape, insertion, colouration, dimensions and density) and macrostructure (clearwing area, species size or wing area). Microstructural traits - density, dimensions - are tightly linked in their evolution, with different constraints according to scale shape, insertion, and colouration. Transparency appears highly relevant for vision, especially for camouflage, with size-dependent and activity-rhythm dependent variations. Links between transparency and latitude are consistent with an ecological relevance of transparency in thermoregulation, and not so for protection against UV radiation. Altogether, our results shed new light on the physical and ecological processes driving the evolution of transparency on land and underline that transparency is a more complex than previously thought colouration strategy.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have implicated both zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) and oligoadenylate synthetase 3 (OAS3)/RNASeL in the attenuation of RNA viruses with elevated CpG and UpA dinucleotides. Mechanisms and inter-relationships between these two pathways were investigated using an echovirus 7 (E7) replicon with compositionally modified sequences inserted into the 3untranslated region. ZAP and OAS3 immunoprecipitation (IP) assays provided complementary data on dinucleotide composition effects on binding. Elevated frequencies of alternative pyrimidine/purine (CpA and UpG) and reversed (GpC and ApU) dinucleotides showed no attenuating effect nor specific binding to ZAP by IP. However, the bases 3 and 5 to CpG motifs influenced replication and ZAP binding; UCGU enhanced CpG-mediated attenuation and ZAP-binding while A residues shielded CpGs from ZAP recognition. Attenuating effects of elevated frequencies of UpA on replication occurred independently of CpG dinucleotides and bound non-competitively with CpG-enriched RNA consistent with a separate recognition site from CpG. Remarkably, immunoprecipitation with OAS3 antibody reproduced the specific binding to CpG- and UpA-enriched RNA sequences. However, OAS3 and ZAP were coimmunoprecipitated in both ZAP and OAS3 IP, and colocalised with E7 and stress granules (SGs) by confocal microscopy analysis of infected cells. ZAPs association with larger cellular complexes may mediate the recruitment of OAS3/RNAseL, KHNYN and other RNA degradation pathways.\n\nImportanceWe have recently discovered that the OAS3/RNAseL antiviral pathway is essential for restriction of CpG- and UpA-enriched viruses, in addition to the requirement for zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP). The current study provides evidence for the specific dinucleotide and wider recognition contexts associated with virus recognition and attenuation. It further documents the association of ZAP and OAS3 and association with stress granules and a wider protein interactome that may mediate antiviral effects in different cellular compartments. The study provides a striking re-conceptualisation of the pathways associated with this aspect of antiviral defence.",

    "abstract": "The nucleolus is a sub-nuclear compartment whose primary function is the biogenesis of ribosomal subunits. Certain viral infections affect the morphology and composition of the nucleolar compartment and influence ribosomal RNA (rRNA) transcription and maturation. However, no description of nucleolar morphology and function during infection with Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is available to date. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we documented extensive destruction of the nuclear and nucleolar architecture during lytic reactivation of KSHV. This was manifested by redistribution of key nucleolar proteins, including the rRNA transcription factor, UBF, the essential pre-rRNA processing factor Fibrillarin, and the nucleolar multifunctional phosphoproteins Nucleophosmin (NPM1) and Nucleolin. Distinct delocalization patterns were evident; certain nucleolar proteins remained together whereas others dissociated, implying that nucleolar proteins undergo nonrandom programmed dispersion. Of note, neither Fibrillarin nor UBF colocalized with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies or with the viral protein LANA-1, and their redistribution was not dependent on viral DNA replication or late viral gene expression. No significant changes in pre-rRNA levels and no accumulation of pre-rRNA intermediates were found by RT-qPCR and Northern blot analysis, respectively. Furthermore, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), combined with immunofluorescence, revealed an overlap between Fibrillarin and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1), which represents the primary product of the pre-rRNA, suggesting that the processing of rRNA proceeds during lytic reactivation. Finally, small changes in the levels of pseudouridylation were documented across the rRNA. Taken together, our results suggest that rRNA transcription and processing persist during lytic reactivation of KSHV, yet they may become uncoupled. Whether the observed nucleolar alterations favor productive infection or signify cellular anti-viral responses remains to be determined.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe describe the extensive destruction of the nuclear and nucleolar architecture during lytic reactivation of KSHV. Distinct delocalization patterns are illustrated: certain nucleolar proteins remained associated with each other whereas others dissociated, implying that nucleolar proteins undergo nonrandom programmed dispersion. Of note, no significant changes in pre-rRNA levels and no accumulation of pre-rRNA intermediates were found, suggesting that pre-RNA transcription and processing continue and could be uncoupled during lytic reactivation. Small changes in the levels of pseudouridylation were documented across the rRNA. Previous studies showed that the different forms of KSHV infection are controlled through cellular and viral functions, which reprogram host epigenetic, transcriptomic, post-transcriptomic and proteomic landscapes. The ability of KSHV to affect the nucleolus and rRNA modifications constitutes a novel interaction network between viral and cellular components. The study of rRNA modifications is still in its infancy; however, the notion of altering cell fate by regulating rRNA modifications has recently begun to emerge, and its significance in viral infection is intriguing.",

    "abstract": "Homology-directed repair (HDR), a critical DNA repair pathway in mammalian cells, is complex, leading to multiple outcomes with different impacts on genomic integrity. However, the factors that control these different outcomes are often not well understood. Here we show that SWS1-SWSAP1-SPIDR controls distinct types of HDR. Despite their requirement for stable assembly of RAD51 recombinase at DNA damage sites, these proteins are not essential for intra-chromosomal HDR, providing insight into why patients and mice with mutations are viable. However, SWS1-SWSAP1-SPIDR is critical for inter-homolog HDR, the first mitotic factor identified specifically for this function. Furthermore, SWS1-SWSAP1-SPIDR drives the high level of sister-chromatid exchange, promotes long-range loss of heterozygosity often involved with cancer initiation, and impels the poor growth of BLM helicase-deficient cells. The relevance of these genetic interactions is evident as SWSAP1 loss prolongs Blm-mutant embryo survival, suggesting a possible druggable target for the treatment of Bloom syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Flaviviruses, including Dengue and Zika, are widespread human pathogens, however, no broadly active therapeutics exist to fight infection. Here, we establish the recently discovered pharmacologic modulator of ER proteostasis 147 as an effective host-centered antiviral strategy. Compound 147 reduces infection by attenuating viral replication without causing toxicity in host cells. 147 is a preferential activator of the ATF6 pathway of the unfolded protein response, which requires targeting of cysteine residues primarily on protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). We find that the antiviral activity of 147 is independent of ATF6 induction but does require modification of reactive thiols on protein targets. Targeting PDIs using RNAi and other PDI small molecule inhibitors was unable to recapitulate the antiviral effects, suggesting additional identified protein targets of 147 may mediate the activity. Importantly, 147 can impair infection of multiple strains of Dengue and Zika virus, indicating that it is suitable as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas loci encode for highly diversified prokaryotic adaptive defense systems that have recently become popular for their applications in gene editing and beyond. The increasing demand for bioinformatic tools that systematically detect and classify CRISPR-Cas systems has been largely challenged by their complex dynamic nature and rapidly expanding classification. Here, we developed CRISPRCasTyper, a new automated software tool with improved capabilities for identifying and typing CRISPR arrays and cas loci across prokaryotic sequences, based on the latest classification and nomenclature (39 subtypes/variants) (Makarova et al. 2020; Pinilla-Redondo et al. 2019). As a novel feature, CRISPRCasTyper uses a machine learning approach to subtype CRISPR arrays based on the sequences of the direct repeats. This allows the typing of orphan and distant arrays which, for example, are commonly observed in fragmented metagenomic assemblies. Furthermore, the tool provides a graphical output, where CRISPRs and cas operon arrangements are visualized in the form of colored gene maps, thus aiding annotation of partial and novel systems through synteny. Moreover, CRISPRCasTyper can resolve hybrid CRISPR-Cas systems and detect loci spanning the ends of sequences with a circular topology, such as complete genomes and plasmids. CRISPRCasTyper was benchmarked against a manually curated set of 31 subtypes/variants with a median accuracy of 98.6%. Altogether, we present an up-to-date and freely available software pipeline for significantly improved automated predictions of CRISPR-Cas loci across genomic sequences.\n\nImplementationCRISPRCasTyper is available through conda and PyPi under the MIT license (https://github.com/Russel88/CRISPRCasTyper), and is also available as a web server (http://cctyper.crispr.dk).",

    "abstract": "Glutamate delta (GluD) receptors belong to the ionotropic glutamate receptor family, yet whether they actually form functional and physiologically-relevant ion channels in neurons remains a debated question. Here we used a chemo-genetic approach to engineer specific and photo-reversible pharmacology in the orphan GluD2 receptor. We incorporated a cysteine mutation in the cavity located above the putative ion channel pore, for site-specific conjugation with a photoswitchable ligand. We first showed that, in the constitutively-open GluD2 Lurcher mutant, current could be rapidly and reversibly decreased with light. We then transposed the cysteine mutation to the native receptor, to demonstrate with absolute pharmacological specificity that metabotropic glutamate receptor signaling opens the GluD2 ion channel in heterologous expression system. Our results assess the functional relevance of GluD2 ion channel and introduce an optogenetic tool that will provide a novel and powerful means for probing GluD2 ionotropic contribution to neuronal physiology.",

We found that certain shuffled repeats were stronger than any of the natural repeats, suggesting balancing of relative properties in BRC repeats. Surprisingly, the contribution from the two modules was poorly correlated with affinities of natural repeats, with weak BRC8 repeat containing the most effective N-terminal module. The binding of the strongest chimera, BRC8-2, to RAD51 was improved by -2.44 kCal/mol compared to the strongest natural repeat, BRC4. Crystal structure of RAD51:BRC8-2 complex shows an improved interface fit and an extended {beta}-hairpin in this repeat.

    "abstract": "Microbial community members exhibit various forms of interactions. Taking advantage of the increasing availability of microbiome data, many computational approaches have been developed to infer bacterial interactions from the co-occurrence of microbes across diverse microbial communities. Additionally, the introduction of genome-scale metabolic models have also enabled the inference of metabolic interactions, such as competition and cooperation, between bacterial species. By nature, phylogenetically similar microbial species are likely to share common functional profiles or biological pathways due to their genomics similarity. Without properly factoring out the phylogenetic relationship, any estimation of the competition and cooperation based on functional/pathway profiles may bias downstream applications.\n\nTo address these challenges, we developed a novel approach for estimating the competition and complementarity indices for a pair of microbial species, adjusted by their phylogenetic distance. An automated pipeline, PhyloMint, was implemented to construct competition and complementarity indices from genome scale metabolic models derived from microbial genomes. Application of our pipeline to 2,815 human-gut bacteria showed high correlation between phylogenetic distance and metabolic competition/cooperation indices among bacteria. Using a discretization approach, we were able to detect pairs of bacterial species with cooperation scores significantly higher than the average pairs of bacterial species with similar phylogenetic distances. A network community analysis of high metabolic cooperation but low competition reveals distinct modules of bacterial interactions. Our results suggest that niche differentiation plays a dominant role in microbial interactions, while habitat filtering also plays a role among certain clades of bacterial species.\n\nAuthor summaryMicrobial communities, also known as microbiomes, are formed through the interactions of various microbial species. Utilizing genomic sequencing, it is possible to infer the compositional make-up of communities as well as predict their metabolic interactions. However, because some species are more similarly related to each other, while others are more distantly related, one cannot directly compare metabolic relationships without first accounting for their phylogenetic relatedness. Here we developed a computational pipeline which predicts complimentary and competitive metabolic relationships between bacterial species, while normalizing for their phylogenetic relatedness. Our results show that phylogenetic distances are correlated with metabolic interactions, and factoring out such relationships can help better understand microbial interactions which drive community formation.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial branching morphogenesis drives the development of organs such as the lung, salivary gland, kidney and the mammary gland. It involves cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell migration. An elaborate network of chemical and mechanical signals between the epithelium and the surrounding mesenchymal tissues regulates the formation and growth of branching organs. Surprisingly, when cultured in isolation from mesenchymal tissues, many epithelial tissues retain the ability to exhibit branching morphogenesis even in absence of proliferation. In this work, we propose a simple, experimentally-plausible mechanism that can drive branching morphogenesis in absence of proliferation and cross-talk with the surrounding mesenchymal tissue. The assumptions of our mathematical model derive from in vitro observations of the behavior of mammary epithelial cells. These data show that autocrine secretion of the growth factor TGF{beta}1 inhibits the formation of cell protrusions, leading to curvature dependent inhibition of sprouting. Our hybrid cellular Potts and partial-differential equation model correctly reproduces the experimentally observed tissue-geometry dependent determination of the sites of branching, and it suffices for the formation of self-avoiding branching structures in absence and also in presence of cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are vital organelles that coordinate cellular energy homeostasis and have important roles in cell death. Therefore, the removal of damaged or excessive mitochondria is critical for maintaining proper cellular function. The PINK1-Parkin pathway removes acutely damaged mitochondria through a well-characterized mitophagy pathway, but basal mitochondrial turnover occurs via distinct and less well-understood mechanisms. Here we report that the MEKK3-MEK5-ERK5 kinase cascade is required for mitochondrial degradation in the absence of exogenous damage. We demonstrate that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the MEKK3-MEK5-ERK5 pathway increases mitochondrial content by reducing lysosome-mediated degradation of mitochondria under basal conditions. We show that the MEKK3-MEK5-ERK5 pathway plays a selective role in basal mitochondrial degradation but is not required for non-selective bulk autophagy, damage-induced mitophagy, or restraint of mitochondrial biogenesis. This illuminates the MEKK3-MEK5-ERK5 pathway as a positive regulator of mitochondrial degradation that acts independently of exogenous mitochondrial stressors.",

    "abstract": "Congenital retinal dystrophies are a major cause of unpreventable and incurable blindness worldwide. Mutations in CDHR1, a retina specific cadherin, are associated with cone-rod dystrophy. The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for mediating orderly and precise targeting of protein degradation to maintain biological homeostasis and coordinate proper development, including retinal development. Recently, our lab uncovered that the seven in absentia (Siah) family of E3 ubiquitin ligases play a role in optic fissure fusion, and identified Cdhr1a as a potential target of Siah. Using two-color whole mount in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we detected siah1 and cdhr1a co-expression as well as protein co-localization in the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL), and more precisely in the connecting cilium of rods and cones between 3-5 days post fertilization (dpf). We confirmed that Siah1 targets Cdhr1a for proteasomal degradation by co-transfection and co-immunoprecipitation in cell culture. To analyze the functional importance of this interaction, we created two transgenic zebrafish lines that express siah1 or an inactive siah1 (siah1{Delta}RING) under the control of the heat shock promoter to modulate Siah activity during photoreceptor development. Overexpression of siah1, but not siah1{Delta}RING, resulted in a decrease in the number of rods and cones at 72 hours post fertilization (hpf). The number of retinal ganglion cells, amacrine and bipolar was not affected by Siah1 overexpression, and there was no significant reduction of proliferating cells in the Siah1 overexpressing retina. We did however detect increased cell death, confirmed by an increase in the number of TUNEL+ cells in the ONL, which was proteasome-dependent, as MG132 treatment rescued the cell death phenotype. Lastly, reduction in rods and cones resulting from increased Siah1 expression was rescued by injection of cdhr1 mRNA, and to an even greater extent by injection of a Siah1-insensitive cdhr1a variant mRNA. Taken together, our work provides the first evidence that Cdhr1a plays a role during early photoreceptor development and that Cdhr1a is regulated by Siah1 via the UPS. This work provides new avenues for investigation into the roles of CDHR1, and now also Siah1, in the predisposition and pathogenesis of inherited cone-rod dystrophy.",

    "abstract": "Chickens and guinea fowl are commonly reared in Gambian homes as affordable sources of protein. Using standard microbiological techniques, we obtained 68 caecal isolates of Escherichia coli from ten chickens and nine guinea fowl in rural Gambia. After Illumina whole-genome sequencing, 28 sequence types were detected in the isolates (four of them novel), of which ST155 was the most common (22/68, 32%). These strains span four of the eight main phylogroups of E. coli, with phylogroups B1 and A being most prevalent. Nearly a third of the isolates harboured at least one antimicrobial resistance gene, while most of the ST155 isolates (14/22, 64%) encoded resistance to [&ge;]3 classes of clinically relevant antibiotics, as well as putative virulence factors, suggesting pathogenic potential in humans. Furthermore, hierarchical clustering revealed that several Gambian poultry strains were closely related to isolates from humans. Although the ST155 lineage is common in poultry from Africa and South America, the Gambian ST155 isolates belong to a unique cgMLST cluster comprised of closely related (38-39 alleles differences) isolates from poultry and livestock from sub-Saharan Africa--suggesting that strains can be exchanged between poultry and livestock in this setting. Continued surveillance of E. coli and other potential pathogens in rural backyard poultry from sub-Saharan Africa is warranted.\n\nAuthor notesAll supporting data and protocols have been provided within the article or as supplementary data files.

Many households in Sub-Saharan Africa rear free-range chickens and guinea fowl, which are often left to scavenge for feed in and around the family compound, where they are frequently exposed to humans, other animals and the environment. Such proximity between backyard poultry and humans is likely to facilitate transmission of pathogens such as Escherichia coli or antimicrobial resistance between the two host species. Little is known about the population structure of E. coli in rural chickens and guinea fowl, although this information is needed to contextualise the potential risks of transmission of bacterial strains between humans and rural backyard poultry. Thus, we sought to investigate the genomic diversity of E. coli in backyard poultry from rural Gambia.",

    "abstract": "High-dimensional datasets, where the number of variables  p is much larger compared to the number of samples  n, are ubiquitous and often render standard classification and regression techniques unreliable due to overfitting. An important research problem is feature selection -- ranking of candidate variables based on their relevance to the outcome variable and retaining those that satisfy a chosen criterion. In this article, we propose a computationally efficient variable selection method based on principal component analysis. The method is very simple, accessible, and suitable for the analysis of high-dimensional datasets. It allows to correct for population structure in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) which otherwise would induce spurious associations and is less likely to overfit. We expect our method to accurately identify important features but at the same time reduce the False Discovery Rate (FDR) (the expected proportion of erroneously rejected null hypotheses) through accounting for the correlation between variables and through de-noising data in the training phase, which also make it robust to outliers in the training data. Being almost as fast as univariate filters, our method allows for valid statistical inference. The ability to make such inferences sets this method apart from most of the current multivariate statistical tools designed for todays high-dimensional data. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method through extensive simulations. A semi-real gene-expression dataset, a challenging childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (CALL) gene expression study, and a GWAS that attempts to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the rice grain length further demonstrate the usefulness of our method in genomic applications.\n\nAuthor summaryAn integral part of modern statistical research is feature selection, which has claimed various scientific discoveries, especially in the emerging genomics applications such as gene expression and proteomics studies, where data has thousands or tens of thousands of features but a limited number of samples. However, in practice, due to unavailability of suitable multivariate methods, researchers often resort to univariate filters when it comes to deal with a large number of variables. These univariate filters do not take into account the dependencies between variables because they independently assess variables one-by-one. This leads to loss of information, loss of statistical power (the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis) and potentially biased estimates. In our paper, we propose a new variable selection method. Being computationally efficient, our method allows for valid inference. The ability to make such inferences sets this method apart from most of the current multivariate statistical tools designed for todays high-dimensional data.",

    "abstract": "The lack of a widely accessible method for expressing genes of interest in wild-type embryos is the fundamental obstacle in understanding genetic regulation during embryonic development. In particular, only a few methods are available for introducing gene expression vectors into cells prior to neural tube closure, a period for the drastic development of many tissues. In this study, we present a simple technique for transferring vectors into the endo- and ectodermal cells of mouse embryos at E7.0 or E8.0 via in utero injection, without any specialized equipment. Using this technique, introduction of retroviruses can facilitate the labeling of cells in various tissues, including the brain, spinal cord, epidermis, and digestive and respiratory organs. As such, this technique can aid in analyzing the roles of genes of interest during endo- and ectodermal development prior to neural tube closure.",

    "abstract": "Diplonemids are considered marine protists and have been reported among the most abundant and diverse eukaryotes in the world oceans. Recently we detected the presence of freshwater diplonemids in Lake Biwa, Japan. However, their distribution and abundances in freshwater ecosystems remain unknown. We assessed abundance and diversity of diplonemids from several geographically distant deep freshwater lakes of the world by amplicon-sequencing, shotgun metagenomics and CARD-FISH. We found diplonemids in all the studied lakes, albeit with low abundances and diversity. We assembled long 18S rRNA sequences from freshwater diplonemids and showed that they form a new lineage distinct from the diverse marine clades. Freshwater diplonemids are a sister-group to marine isolates from coastal and bay areas, suggesting a recent habitat transition from marine to freshwater habitats. Images of CARD-FISH targeted freshwater diplonemids suggest they feed on bacteria. Our analyses of 18S rRNA sequences retrieved from single cell genomes of marine diplonemids shows they encode multiple rRNA copies that may be very divergent from each other, suggesting that marine diplonemid abundance and diversity both have been overestimated. These results have wider implications on assessing eukaryotic abundances in natural habitats by using amplicon-sequencing alone.",
