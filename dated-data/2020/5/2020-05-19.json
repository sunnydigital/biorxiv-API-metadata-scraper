    "abstract": "GABAA receptors mediate most inhibitory synaptic transmission in the brain of vertebrates. Following GABA binding and fast activation, these receptors undergo a slower desensitization, whose conformational pathway remains largely elusive. To explore the mechanism of desensitization, we used concatemeric 1{beta}2{gamma}2 GABAA receptors to selectively introduce gain-of-desensitization mutations one subunit at a time. A library of twenty-six mutant combinations was generated and their bi-exponential macroscopic desensitization rates measured. Introducing mutations at the different subunits shows a strongly asymmetric pattern with a key contribution of the {gamma}2 subunit, and combining mutations results in marked synergistic effects indicating a non-concerted mechanism. Kinetic modelling indeed suggests a pathway where subunits move independently, the desensitization of two subunits being required to occlude the pore. Our work thus hints towards a very diverse and labile conformational landscape during desensitization, with potential implications in physiology and pharmacology.",

    "abstract": "Talin is a mechanosensitive adapter protein which couples integrins to the cytoskeleton and regulates integrin-mediated adhesion. Talin rod domain-containing protein-1 (TLNRD1) shares 22% homology with the R7R8 domains of talin, and is highly conserved throughout vertebrate evolution, however little is known about its function. Here we show that TLNRD1 is an -helical protein which shares the same atypical topology as talin R7R8, but forms a novel antiparallel dimer arrangement. Actin co-sedimentation assays and electron microscopy reveal TLNRD1 is an actin-bundling protein that forms tight actin bundles. In addition, TLNRD1 binds to the same LD-motif containing proteins, RIAM and KANK, as talin, and thus may act in competition with talin. Filopodia are cell protrusions supported by tightly bundled actin filaments and TLNRD1 localises to filopodia tips, increases filopodia number and promotes cell migration in 2D. Together our results suggest that TLNRD1 has similar functionality to talin R7R8, serving as a nexus between the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons independent of adhesion complexes.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear lamina bridges mechanical forces from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus, to initiate nuclear mechanotransduction. The concentration of nuclear Lamin proteins, particularly Lamin A/C is crucial for the mechanical properties of the nucleus and nuclear mechanotransduction. Recent studies in mesenchymal tissues show that the concentration of Lamin A/C scales with stiffness and concentration of the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM). But in epithelial tissues, that lack a strong cell-ECM interaction, it is still unclear how Lamin A/C is regulated. Here, we show that concentration of Lamin A/C in epithelial tissues scales with apico-basal compression of cells and is independent of ECM concentration. But, ectopically altering the concentration of Lamin A/C does not influence cell shapes in epithelial tissues. Using genetic perturbations in Drosophila epithelial tissues, we reveal that apico-basal cell compression regulates the concentration of Lamin A/C by deforming the nucleus. We observe a similar mechanism of Lamin A/C regulation in mammalian Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells suggesting that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Taken together, our results reveal a unidirectional mechanical coupling between cell mechanics and nuclear mechanics via the regulation of Lamin A/C. We anticipate that mechanism of Lamin A/C regulation that we revealed, could form the basis for understanding nuclear mechanotransduction in epithelial tissues.",

    "abstract": "Hair graying is a universal hallmark of aging believed to be linked to psychological stress. Here we develop a novel approach to quantitatively profile natural graying events along individual human hair shafts, resulting in a quantifiable physical timescale of hair pigmentation patterns (HPPs). Using this approach, we quantify rare events of white/gray hairs that naturally regain pigmentation within days to weeks, thereby quantitatively defining the reversibility of graying in healthy, unmedicated individuals. Proteomic analysis shows that graying is marked by the upregulation of proteins related to energy metabolism, mitochondria, and antioxidant defenses. Combining hair pigmentation profiling and proteomics at the single hair level, we also report hair graying and its reversal occurring in parallel with behavioral and psychological stressors. A computational simulation suggests a threshold-based mechanism for the temporary reversibility of graying. Quantitatively mapping HPPs in humans provides an opportunity to longitudinally examine the influence of life exposures on biological aging.",

    "abstract": "Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), functioning in the de novo synthesis of dNTPs, is crucial for DNA replication and cell cycle progression. However, the knowledge about the RNR in plants is still limited. In this study, we isolated ylc1 (young leaf chlorosis 1) mutant, which exhibited many development defects such as dwarf stature, chlorotic young leaf, and smaller fruits. Map-based cloning, complementation, and knocking-out experiments confirmed that YLC1 encodes a large subunit of RNR (SlRNRL1), an enzyme involved in the de novo biosynthesis of dNTPs. Physiological and transcriptomic analyses indicate that SlRNRL1 plays a crucial role in the regulation of cell cycle, chloroplast biogenesis, and photosynthesis in tomato. In addition, we knocked out SlRNRL2 (a SlRNRL1 homolog) using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in the tomato genome, and found that SlRNRL2, possessing a redundant function with SlRNRL1, played a weak role in the formation of RNR complex due to its low expression intensity. Genetic analysis reveals that SlRNRL1 and SlRNRL2 are essential for tomato growth and development as the double mutant slrnrl1slrnrl2 is lethal. This also implies that the de novo synthesis of dNTPs is required for seed development in tomato. Overall, our results provide a new insight for understanding the SlRNRL1 and SlRNRL2 functions and the mechanism of de novo biosynthesis of dNTPs in plants.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRapid and practical DNA-sequencing processing has become essential for modern biomedical laboratories, especially in the field of cancer, pathology and genetics. While sequencing turn-over time has been, and still is, a bottleneck in research and diagnostics, the field of bioinformatics is moving at a rapid pace - both in terms of hardware and software development. Here, we benchmarked the local performance of three of the most important Spark-enabled Genome analysis toolkit 4 (GATK4) tools in a targeted sequencing workflow: Duplicate marking, base quality score recalibration (BQSR) and variant calling on targeted DNA sequencing using a modest hyperthreading 12-core single CPU and a high-speed PCI express solid-state drive.\n\nResultsCompared to the previous GATK version the performance of Spark-enabled BQSR and HaplotypeCaller is shifted towards a more efficient usage of the available cores on CPU and outperforms the earlier GATK3.8 version with an order of magnitude reduction in processing time to analysis ready variants, whereas MarkDuplicateSpark was found to be thrice as fast. Furthermore, HaploTypeCallerSpark and BQSRPipelineSpark were significantly faster than the equivalent GATK4 standard tools with a combined [~]86% reduction in execution time, reaching a median rate of ten million processed bases per second, and duplicate marking was reduced [~]42%. The called variants were found to be in close agreement between the Spark and non-Spark versions, with an overall concordance of 98%. In this setup, the tools were also highly efficient when compared execution on a small 72 virtual CPU/18-node Google Cloud cluster.\n\nConclusionIn conclusion, GATK4 offers practical parallelization possibilities for DNA sequence processing, and the Spark-enabled tools optimize performance and utilization of local CPUs. Spark utilizing GATK variant calling is several times faster than previous GATK3.8 multithreading with the same multi-core, single CPU, configuration. The improved opportunities for parallel computations not only hold implications for high-performance cluster, but also for modest laboratory or research workstations for targeted sequencing analysis, such as exome, panel or amplicon sequencing.",

    "abstract": "We introduce pleiotropic association test (PAT) for joint analysis of multiple traits using GWAS summary statistics. The method utilizes the decomposition of phenotypic covariation into genetic and environmental components to create a likelihood ratio test statistic for each genetic variant. Though PAT does not directly interpret which trait(s) drive the association, a per trait interpretation of the omnibus p-value is provided through an extension to the meta-analysis framework, m-values. In simulations, we show PAT controls the false positive rate, increases statistical power, and is robust to model misspecifications of genetic effect.\n\nAdditionally, simulations comparing PAT to two multi-trait methods, HIPO and MTAG show PAT having a 43.0% increase in the number of omnibus associations over the other methods. When these associations are interpreted on a per trait level using m-values, PAT has 52.2% more per trait interpretations with a 0.57% false positive assignment rate. When analyzing four traits from the UK Biobank, PAT identifies 22,095 novel associated variants. Through the m-values interpretation framework, the number of total per trait associations for two traits are almost tripled and are nearly doubled for another trait relative to the original single trait GWAS.",

    "abstract": "Orangutans (Pongo spp.) occur at low densities and therefore large areas are necessary to sustain viable metapopulations, defined here as sets of conspecific units of individuals linked by dispersal. Historically, orangutans lived in large contiguous areas of intact rainforest, but are now increasingly found in agricultural and other landscapes modified by people. Here we collate evidence of orangutans utilizing isolated forest fragments (< 500 ha) within multiple-use landscapes dominated by oil palm monoculture across Borneo. Orangutan signs (i.e. nests) were evident in 76 fragments surveyed by helicopter, and in 50 of 70 additional fragments surveyed on the ground; on average 63 ha in size. This includes presence of adult resident females with dependent young confirmed in 40% of the fragments assessed by ground survey. Our study revealed some resident females are raising offspring in isolated forest patches within mature oil palm stands. This not only confirms that some forest patches can sustain orangutans, but indicates migratory males are capable of reaching these fragments scattered throughout the multiple-use landscape. Therefore, orangutans that use or live in even small isolated forest patches are an essential part of the overall metapopulation by maintaining gene flow between, and genetic connectivity within, populations distributed across larger multiple-use landscapes. Orangutan survival is commonly thought to be low in small, isolated forest patches, and the customary management strategy is to remove (translocate) these individuals and release them in larger forests. In some cases, translocations may be necessary, i.e. in case of fire or when the animals are in eminent danger of being killed and have no other refuge. However, the small amount of data available indicates that mortality rates during and after translocations are high, while the impacts of removing animals from spatially dispersed metapopulations are unknown. Therefore, we argue the current policy of routine translocation rather than conserving the species within human-modified landscapes could inadvertently decrease critical metapopulation functionality necessary for long-term viability. It is clear that orangutans need natural forest to survive, but our findings show that fragmented agricultural landscapes can also serve as complementary conservation areas in addition to fully protected areas if they are well designed with ecological connections, and if orangutan killing can be prevented. To achieve this, we call for a paradigm shift from the traditional large single forest model to one that emphasizes metapopulation functionality in the fragmented forest - human use matrix characteristic of the Anthropocene.\n\nVersion 2 (20 May 2020): this manuscript is a non-peer reviewed preprint shared via the BiorXiv server while being considered for publication in a peer-reviewed academic journal.

We observed that chromatin from disrupted virions, but not minichromosomes, was efficiently bound by HIS-tagged SP1 in vitro, while the opposite was true for the presence of endogenous SP1 introduced in vivo. Using ChIP-Seq to compare the location of SP1 to nucleosomes carrying modified histones, we found that SP1 could occupy its whole binding site in virion chromatin but only the early side of its binding site in most of the minichromosomes carrying modified histones due to the presence of overlapping nucleosomes. The results suggest that during the initiation of an SV40 infection, SP1 binds to an open region in SV40 virion chromatin but quickly triggers chromatin reorganization and its own removal by a hit and run mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The physical basis of consciousness remains one of the most elusive concepts in current science. One influential conjecture is that consciousness is to do with some form of causality, measurable through information. The integrated information theory of consciousness (IIT) proposes that conscious experience, filled with rich and specific content, corresponds directly to a hierarchically organised, irreducible pattern of causal interactions; i.e. an integrated informational structure among elements of a system. Here, we tested this conjecture in a simple biological system (fruit flies), estimating the information structure of the system during wakefulness and general anesthesia. Consistent with this conjecture, we found that integrated interactions among populations of neurons during wakefulness collapsed to isolated clusters of interactions during anesthesia. We used classification analysis to quantify the accuracy of discrimination between wakeful and anesthetised states, and found that informational structures inferred conscious states with greater accuracy than a scalar summary of the structure, a measure which is generally championed as the main measure of IIT. In stark contrast to a view which assumes feedforward architecture for insect brains, especially fly visual systems, we found rich information structures, which cannot arise from purely feedforward systems, occurred across the fly brain. Further, these information structures collapsed uniformly across the brain during anesthesia. Our results speak to the potential utility of the novel concept of an \"informational structure\" as a measure for level of consciousness, above and beyond simple scalar values.\n\nAuthor summaryThe physical basis of consciousness remains elusive. Efforts to measure consciousness have generally been restricted to simple, scalar quantities which summarise the complexity of a system, inspired by integrated information theory, which links a multi-dimensional, informational structure to the contents of experience in a system. Due to the complexity of the definition of the structure, assessment of its utility as a measure of conscious arousal in a system has largely been ignored. In this manuscript we evaluate the utility of such an information structure in measuring the level of arousal in the fruit fly. Our results indicate that this structure can be more informative about the level of arousal in a system than even the single-value summary proposed by the theory itself. These results may push consciousness research towards the notion of multi-dimensional informational structures, instead of traditional scalar summaries.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSowing time is commonly used as the temporal reference for Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) experiments in high throughput plant phenotyping (HTPP) systems. This relies on the assumption that germination and seedling establishment are uniform across the population. However, individual seeds have different development trajectories even under uniform environmental conditions. This leads to increased variance in quantitative phenotyping approaches. We developed the Digital Adjustment of Plant Development (DAPD) normalization method. It normalizes time-series HTPP measurements by reference to an early developmental stage and in an automated manner. The timeline of each measurement series is shifted to a reference time. The normalization is determined by cross-correlation at multiple time points of the time-series measurements, which may include rosette area, leaf size, and number.\n\nResultsThe DAPD method improved the accuracy of phenotyping measurements by decreasing the statistical dispersion of quantitative traits across a time-series. We applied DAPD to evaluate the relative growth rate in A. thaliana plants and demonstrated that it improves uniformity in measurements, permitting a more informative comparison between individuals. Application of DAPD decreased variance of phenotyping measurements by up to 2.5 times compared to sowing-time normalization. The DAPD method also identified more outliers than any other central tendency technique applied to the non-normalized dataset.",

    "abstract": "Individuals, who score high in self-reported intolerance of uncertainty (IU), tend to find uncertainty anxiety-provoking. IU has been reliably associated with disrupted threat extinction. However, it remains unclear whether IU would be related to disrupted extinction to other arousing stimuli that are not threatening (i.e., rewarding). We addressed this question by conducting a reward associative learning task with acquisition and extinction training phases (n = 58). Throughout the associative learning task, we recorded valence ratings (i.e. liking), skin conductance response (SCR) (i.e. sweating), and corrugator supercilii activity (i.e. brow muscle indicative or negative and positive affect) to learned reward and neutral cues. During acquisition training with partial reward reinforcement, higher IU was associated with greater corrugator supercilii activity to neutral compared to reward cues. IU was not related to valence ratings or SCRs during the acquisition or extinction training phases. These preliminary results suggest that IU-related deficits during extinction may be limited to situations with threat. The findings further our conceptual understanding of IUs role in the associative learning and extinction of reward, and in relation to the processing of threat and reward more generally.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWEpilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, with about 30% of cases being drug-resistant and requiring surgical intervention. To localize the epileptogenic zone (EZ), the pathological area that has to be surgically removed, brain regions are inspected for the presence of spikes during the interictal periods. This procedure maps irritative zones where spikes are present, but it is still challenging to determine which of the irritative zones generate seizures. To localize the source of seizures more precisely, a large-scale approach could be applied where the causal relationship is assessed between the signals recorded in a finite number of irritative zones [27]. This method however, does not reveal the fine-grained spatiotemporal patterns of spikes, which could provide valuable information regarding EZ location and increase the likelihood of surgery success [33].\n\nHere we present a framework to noninvasively investigate the fine patterns of interictal spikes present in magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data. We use a traveling wave model, previously employed in the analysis of cortical alpha oscillations [16], to regularize the MEG inverse problem and to determine the cortical paths of spike traveling waves. Our algorithm represents spike propagation patterns as a superposition of local waves traveling along radial paths stemming from a single origin. With the help of the positively constrained LASSO technique we scan over wave onset moment and propagation velocity parameters to determine their combination that yields the best fit to the MEG sensor data of each spike.\n\nWe first used realistically simulated MEG data to validate the algorithm ability to successfully track interictal activity on a millimeter-millisecond scale. Next, we examined MEG data from three patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Wave-like spike patterns with clear propagation dynamics were found in a fraction of spikes, whereas the other fraction could not be explained by the wave propagation model with a small number of propagation directions. Moreover, in agreement with the previous work [33], the spike waves with clear propagation dynamics exhibited spatial segregation and matched the clinical records on seizure onset zones (SOZs) available for two patients out of three.",

This research is to investigate the antidiarrheal, antimicrobial, and antioxidant possibilities of the methanol soluble extract of Colocasia gigantea.\n\nMethodsAntidiarrheal investigation was performed by using in vivo castor oil induced diarrheal method where as in vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant investigation have been implemented by disc diffusion and DPPH scavenging method respectively. Moreover, in silico studies were followed by molecular docking analysis of several secondary metabolites were appraised with Schrodinger-Maestro v 11.1.\n\nResultsThe induction of plant extract (200 and 400 mg/kg, b.w, p.o), the castor oil mediated diarrhea has been minimized 19.05 % (p < 0.05) and 42.86 % (p < 0.001) respectively. The methanolic extract of C. gigantea showed mild sensitivity against almost all the tested strains but it shows high consistency of phenolic content and furthermore yielded 67.68 g/mL of IC50 value in the DPPH test. The higher and lower binding affinity was shown in beta-amyrin and monoglyceryl stearic acid against the kappa-opioid receptor (PDB ID: 4DJH) with a docking score of -3.28 kcal/mol and -6.64 kcal/mol respectively. In the antimicrobial investigation, Penduletin and Beta-Amyrin showed the highest and lowest binding affinity against the selected receptors with the docking score of -8.27 kcal/mol and -1.66 kcal/mol respectively.\n\nConclusionThe results of our scientific research reflect that the methanol soluble extract of C. gigantea is safe which may provide possibilities of alleviation of diarrhea and as a potential wellspring of antioxidants which can be considered as an alternate source for exploration of new medicinal products.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in minor spliceosome components are linked to diseases such as Roifman syndrome, Lowry-Wood syndrome, and early-onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA). Here we report that besides increased minor intron retention, Roifman syndrome and EOCA can also be characterized by elevated alternative splicing (AS) around minor introns. Consistent with the idea that the assembly/activity of the minor spliceosome informs AS in minor intron-containing genes (MIGs), inhibition of all minor spliceosome snRNAs led to upregulated AS. Notably, alternatively spliced MIG isoforms were bound to polysomes in the U11-null dorsal telencephalon, which suggested that aberrant MIG protein expression could contribute to disease pathogenesis. In agreement, expression of an aberrant isoform of the MIG Dctn3 by in utero electroporation, affected radial glial cell divisions. Finally, we show that AS around minor introns is executed by the major spliceosome and is regulated by U11-59K of the minor spliceosome, which forms exon-bridging interactions with proteins of the major spliceosome. Overall, we extend the exon-definition model to MIGs and postulate that disruptions of exon-bridging interactions might contribute to disease severity and pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "In plants, phosphate (Pi) homeostasis is regulated by the interaction of Pi starvation response transcription factors (PHRs) with stand-alone SPX proteins, which act as sensors for inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs). Recently, ITPK1 was shown to generate the PP-InsP InsP7 from InsP6 in vitro, but the importance of this activity in Pi signaling remained unknown. Here, we show that uncontrolled Pi accumulation in ITPK1-deficient plants is accompanied by impaired Pi-dependent InsP7 and InsP8 synthesis. Reciprocal grafting demonstrates that Pi starvation responses are mainly controlled by ITPK1 activity in shoots. Nuclear magnetic resonance assays and PAGE analyses with recombinant protein reveal that besides InsP6 phosphorylation, ITPK1 is also able to catalyze ATP synthesis using 5-InsP7 but not any other InsP7 isomer as a P-donor when ATP is low. Additionally, we show that the dynamic changes in InsP7 and InsP8 to cellular Pi are conserved from land plant species to human cells, suggesting that Pi-dependent PP-InsP synthesis is a common component of Pi signaling across kingdoms. Together, our study demonstrates how Pi-dependent changes in nutritional and energetic states modulate ITPK1 activities to fine-tune the synthesis of PP-InsPs.",

    "abstract": "Carbon fixation is one of the most important biochemical processes. Most natural carbon fixation pathways are thought to have emerged from enzymes that originally performed other metabolic tasks. Can we recreate the emergence of a carbon fixation pathway in a heterotrophic host by recruiting only endogenous enzymes? In this study, we address this question by systematically analyzing possible carbon fixation pathways composed only of Escherichia coli native enzymes. We identify the GED (Gnd-Entner-Doudoroff) cycle as the simplest pathway that can operate with high thermodynamic driving force. This autocatalytic route is based on reductive carboxylation of ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gnd), followed by reactions of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. We demonstrate the in vivo feasibility of this new-to-nature pathway by constructing E. coli gene deletion strains whose growth on pentose sugars depends on the GED shunt, a linear variant of the GED cycle which does not require the regeneration of Ru5P. Several metabolic adaptations, most importantly the increased production of NADPH, assist in establishing sufficiently high flux to sustain this growth. Our study exemplifies a trajectory for the emergence of carbon fixation in a heterotrophic organism and demonstrates a synthetic pathway of biotechnological interest.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological studies of obesity, Type-2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular diseases and several common cancers have revealed an increased risk in Native Hawaiians compared to European- or Asian-Americans living in the Hawaiian islands. However, there remains a gap in our understanding of the genetic factors that affect the health of Native Hawaiians. To fill this gap, we studied the genetic risk factors at both the chromosomal and sub-chromosomal scales using genome-wide SNP array data on [~]4,000 Native Hawaiians from the Multiethnic Cohort. We estimated the genomic proportion of Native Hawaiian ancestry (\"global ancestry,\" which we presumed to be Polynesian in origin), as well as this ancestral component along each chromosome (\"local ancestry\") and tested their respective association with binary and quantitative cardiometabolic traits. After attempting to adjust for non-genetic covariates evaluated through questionnaires, we found that per 10% increase in global Polynesian genetic ancestry, there is a respective 8.6%, and 11.0% increase in the odds of being diabetic (P = 1.65 10-4) and having heart failure (P = 2.18 10-4), as well as a 0.059 s.d. increase in BMI (P = 1.04 10-10). When testing the association of local Polynesian ancestry with risk of disease or biomarkers, we identified a chr6 region associated with T2D. This association was driven by an uniquely prevalent variant in Polynesian ancestry individuals. However, we could not replicate this finding in an independent Polynesian cohort from Samoa due to the small sample size of the replication cohort. In conclusion, we showed that Polynesian ancestry, which likely capture both genetic and lifestyle risk factors, is associated with an increased risk of obesity, Type-2 diabetes, and heart failure, and that larger cohorts of Polynesian ancestry individuals will be needed to replicate the putative association on chr6 with T2D.\n\nAuthor SummaryNative Hawaiians are one of the fastest growing ethnic minority in the U.S., and exhibit increased risk for metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. However, they are generally understudied, especially from a genetic perspective. To fill this gap, we studied the association of Polynesian genetic ancestry, at genomic and subgenomic scale, with quantitative and binary traits in self-identified Native Hawaiians. We showed that Polynesian ancestry, which likely capture both genetic and non-genetic risk factors related to Native Hawaiian people and culture are associated with increased risk for obesity, type-2 diabetes, and heart failure. While we do not endorse utilizing genetic information to supplant current standards of defining community membership through self-identity or genealogical records, our results suggest future studies could identify population-specific genetic susceptibility factors that may be useful in suggesting underlying biological mechanisms and reducing the disparity in disease interventions in Polynesian populations.",

    "abstract": "Variants close to the VPS13C/C2CD4A/C2CD4B locus are associated with altered risk of type 2 diabetes in genome-wide association studies. Whilst previous functional work has suggested roles for VPS13C and C2CD4A in disease development, none has explored the role of C2CD4B. Here, we show that systemic inactivation of C2cd4b in mice leads to marked, but highly sexually dimorphic, changes in body weight and glucose homeostasis. Female C2cd4b mice display unchanged body weight but abnormal glucose tolerance and defective in vivo, but not in vitro, insulin secretion, associated with a marked decrease in follicle stimulating hormone levels. In sharp contrast, male C2cd4b null mice displayed normal glucose tolerance but an increase in body weight and fasting glycemia after maintenance on high fat diet. No metabolic disturbances were observed after global inactivation of C2cd4a in mice, or in pancreatic {beta} cell function at larval stages in C2cd4ab null zebrafish. These studies suggest that C2cd4b may act centrally to influence sex-dependent circuits which control pancreatic {beta} cell function and glucose tolerance in rodents. However, the absence of sexual dimorphism in the impact of diabetes risk variants argues for additional roles for C2CD4A or VPS13C in the control of glucose homeostasis in man.",

We have developed a non-linear randomized Haseman-Elston (RHE) regression method applicable when many environmental variables have been measured on each individual. The method (GPLEMMA) simultaneously estimates a linear environmental score (ES) and its GxE heritability. We compare the method via simulation to a whole-genome regression approach (LEMMA) for estimating GxE heritability. We show that GPLEMMA is computationally efficient and produces results highly correlated with those from LEMMA when applied to simulated data and real data from the UK Biobank.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a growing societal scourge responsible for approximately 4 million deaths worldwide. Recent studies have uncovered that paternal excessive weight induced by an unbalanced diet affects the metabolic health of offspring. These reports mainly employed single-generation male exposure. However, the consequences of multigenerational unbalanced diet feeding on the metabolic health of progeny remain largely unknown. Here, we show that maintaining paternal western diet feeding for five consecutive generations in mice induces a gradual enhancement in fat mass and related metabolic diseases over generations. Strikingly, chow-diet-fed progenies from these multigenerational western-diet-fed males develop a \"healthy\" overweight phenotype that is not reversed after 4 subsequent generations. Mechanistically, sperm RNA microinjection experiments into zygotes suggest that sperm RNAs are sufficient for establishment but not for long-term maintenance of epigenetic inheritance of metabolic pathologies. Progressive and permanent metabolic deregulation induced by successive paternal western-diet-fed generations may contribute to the worldwide epidemic of metabolic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Genebanks harbor original landraces carrying many original favorable alleles for mitigating biotic and abiotic stresses. Their genetic diversity remains however poorly characterized due to their large within genetic diversity. We developed a high-throughput, cheap and labor saving DNA bulk approach based on SNP Illumina Infinium HD array to genotype landraces. Samples were gathered for each landrace by mixing equal weights from young leaves, from which DNA was extracted. We then estimated allelic frequencies in each DNA bulk based on fluorescent intensity ratio (FIR) between two alleles at each SNP using a two step-approach. We first tested either whether the DNA bulk was monomorphic or polymorphic according to the two FIR distributions of individuals homozygous for allele A or B, respectively. If the DNA bulk was polymorphic, we estimated its allelic frequency by using a predictive equation calibrated on FIR from DNA bulks with known allelic frequencies. Our approach: (i) gives accurate allelic frequency estimations that are highly reproducible across laboratories, (ii) protects against false detection of allele fixation within landraces. We estimated allelic frequencies of 23,412 SNPs in 156 landraces representing American and European maize diversity. Modified Rogers genetic Distance between 156 landraces estimated from 23,412 SNPs and 17 SSRs using the same DNA bulks were highly correlated, suggesting that the ascertainment bias is low. Our approach is affordable, easy to implement and does not require specific bioinformatics support and laboratory equipment, and therefore should be highly relevant for large-scale characterization of genebanks for a wide range of species.",

    "abstract": "The Cleveland Bay horse is one of the oldest equines in the United Kingdom, with pedigree data going back almost 300 years. The studbook is essentially closed and because of this, there are concerns about loss of genetic variation across generations. The breed is one of five equine breeds listed as \"critical\" (<300 registered adult breeding females) by the UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust in their annual Watchlist. Due to their critically endangered status, the current breadth of their genetic diversity is of concern, and assessment of this can lead to improved breed management strategies. Herein, both genealogical and molecular methods are combined in order to assess founder representation, lineage, and allelic diversity. Data from 16 microsatellite loci from a reference population of 402 individuals determined a loss of 91% and 48% of stallion and dam lines, respectively in the reference population. Only 3 ancestors determine 50% of the genome in the living population, with 70% of maternal lineage being derived from 3 founder females, and all paternal lineages traced back to a single founder stallion. Methods and theory are described in detail in order to demonstrate the scope of this analysis for wider conservation strategies. We quantitatively demonstrate the critical nature of the genetic resources within the breed, and offer a perspective on implementing this data in considered breed management strategies.",

    "abstract": "Vector population control using insecticides is a key element of current strategies to prevent malaria transmission in Africa. The introduction of effective insecticides, such as the organophosphate pirimiphos-methyl, is essential to overcome the recurrent emergence of resistance driven by the highly diverse Anopheles genomes. Here, we use a population genomic approach to investigate the basis of pirimiphos-methyl resistance in the major malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae and A. coluzzii. A combination of copy number variation and a single non-synonymous substitution in the acetylcholinesterase gene, Ace1, provides the key resistance diagnostic in an A. coluzzii population from Cote dIvoire that we used for sequence-based association mapping, with replication in other West African populations. The Ace1 and substitution and duplications occur on a unique resistance haplotype that evolved in A. gambiae and introgressed into A. coluzzii, and is now common in West Africa probably due to cross-resistance with previously used insecticides. Our findings highlight the phenotypic value of this complex resistance haplotype and clarify its evolutionary history, providing tools to understand the current and future effectiveness of pirimiphos-methyl based interventions.",

    "abstract": "The measurement of RNA abundance derived from massively parallel sequencing experiments is an essential technique. Methods that reduce ribosomal RNA levels are usually required prior to sequencing library construction because ribosomal RNA typically comprises the vast majority of a total RNA sample. For some experiments, ribosomal RNA depletion is favored over poly(A) selection because it offers a more inclusive representation of the transcriptome. However, methods to deplete ribosomal RNA are generally proprietary, complex, inefficient, applicable to only specific species, or compatible with only a narrow range of RNA input levels. Here, we describe Ribo-Pop (ribosomal RNA depletion for popular use), a simple workflow and antisense oligo design strategy that we demonstrate works over a wide input range and can be easily adapted to any organism with a sequenced genome. We provide a computational pipeline for probe selection, a streamlined 20-minute protocol, and ready-to-use oligo sequences for several organisms. We anticipate that our simple and generalizable \"open source\" design strategy would enable virtually any lab to pursue full transcriptome sequencing in their organism of interest with minimal time and resource investment.",

    "abstract": "The diatom, Cyclotella cryptica, is a well-established experimental model for physiological studies and, more recently, biotechnology applications of diatoms. To further facilitate its use as a model diatom species, we report an improved reference genome assembly and annotation for C. cryptica strain CCMP332. We used a combination of long- and short-read sequencing to assemble a high-quality and contaminant-free genome. The genome is 171 Mb in size and consists of 662 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 494 kb. This represents a 176-fold decrease in scaffold number and 41-fold increase in scaffold N50 compared to the previous assembly. The genome contains 21,250 predicted genes, 75% of which were assigned putative functions. Repetitive DNA comprises 59% of the genome, and an improved classification of repetitive elements indicated that a historically steady accumulation of transposable elements has contributed to the relatively large size of the C. cryptica genome. The high-quality C. cryptica genome will serve as a valuable reference for ecological, genetic, and biotechnology studies of diatoms.\n\nData available fromNCBI BioProjects PRJNA628076 and PRJNA589195",

    "abstract": "Genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk affect gene regulation in metabolically relevant tissues, such as pancreatic islets. Here, we investigated contributions of regulatory programs active during pancreatic development to T2D risk. Generation of chromatin maps from developmental precursors throughout pancreatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) identifies enrichment of T2D variants in pancreatic progenitor-specific stretch enhancers that are not active in islets. Genes associated with progenitor-specific stretch enhancers are predicted to regulate developmental processes, most notably tissue morphogenesis. Through gene editing in hESCs, we demonstrate that progenitor-specific enhancers harboring T2D-associated variants regulate cell polarity genes LAMA1 and CRB2. Knockdown of lama1 or crb2 in zebrafish embryos causes a defect in pancreas morphogenesis and impairs islet cell development. Together, our findings reveal that a subset of T2D risk variants specifically affects pancreatic developmental programs, suggesting that dysregulation of developmental processes can predispose to T2D.",

    "abstract": "Tracking active transcription with the nuclear run-on (NRO) assays has been instrumental in uncovering mechanisms of gene regulation. The coupling of NROs with high-throughput sequencing has facilitated the discovery of previously unannotated or undetectable RNA classes genome-wide. Precision run-on sequencing (PRO-seq) is a run-on variant that maps polymerase active sites with nucleotide or near-nucleotide resolution. One main drawback to this and many other nascent RNA detection methods is the somewhat intimidating multi-day workflow associated with creating the libraries suitable for high-throughput sequencing. Here, we present an improved PRO-seq protocol where many of the enzymatic steps are carried out while the biotinylated NRO RNA remains bound to streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. These adaptations reduce time, sample loss and RNA degradation, and we demonstrate that the resulting libraries are of the same quality as libraries generated using the original published protocol. The assay is also more sensitive which permits reproducible, high-quality libraries from 104-105 cells instead of 106-107. Altogether, the improved protocol is more tractable allows for nascent RNA profiling from small samples, such as rare samples or FACS sorted cell populations.",

Of the 24 investigated individuals, 15 were involved in kinship relationships of varying degrees, including 3 parent-offspring relationships. All observed parent-offspring pairs were mother and son. In addition to the absence of biological daughters, we observed a number of young women and girls with no biological relatives in our sample. These observations, together with the high mitochondrial diversity in our sample, are consistent with the practice of female exogamy in the population served by Mokrin. However, moderate-to-high Y-chromosomal diversity suggests a degree of male mobility greater than that expected under strict patrilocality. Individual status differences at Mokrin, as indicated by grave goods, support the inference that females could inherit status, but could not transmit status to all their sons. The case of a son whose grave good richness outstrips that of his biological mother suggests that sons had the possibility to acquire status during their lifetimes. The Mokrin sample resembles a genetically unstructured population, suggesting that the communitys social hierarchies were not accompanied by strict marriage barriers.",

We present the first study evaluating gut microbiome composition in transitioning South African populations using short- and long-read sequencing. We analyzed stool samples from adult females (age 40 - 72) living in rural Bushbuckridge municipality (n=118) or urban Soweto (n=51) and find that these microbiomes are taxonomically intermediate between those of individuals living in high-income countries and traditional communities. We demonstrate that reference collections are incomplete for characterization of microbiomes of individuals living outside high-income countries, resulting in artificially low species-level beta diversity measurements. To improve reference databases, we generated complete genomes of undescribed taxa, including Treponema, Lentisphaerae, and Succinatimonas species.

Each gRNA expression cassette in the library is precisely integrated into a genomic landing pad thus reducing the clonal variation.

    "abstract": "Metabolic networks undergo gene expression regulation in response to external nutrient signals. In microbes, the synthesis of enzymes that are used to transport and catabolize less preferred carbon sources is repressed in the presence of a preferred carbon source. For most microbes, glucose is a preferred carbon source, and it has long been believed that as long as glucose is present in the environment, the expression of genes related to the metabolism of alternative carbon sources is shut down, due to catabolite repression. However, recent studies have shown that the induction of the galactose (GAL) metabolic network does not solely depend on the exhaustion of glucose. Instead, the GAL genes respond to the external concentration ratio of galactose to glucose, a phenomenon of unknown mechanism that we termed ratio-sensing. Using mathematical modeling, we found that ratio-sensing is a general phenomenon that can arise from competition between two carbon sources for shared transporters, between transcription factors for binding to communal regulatory sequences of the target genes, or a combination of the aforementioned two levels of competition. We analyzed how the parameters describing the competitive interaction influenced ratio-sensing behaviors in each scenario and found that the concatenation of both layers of signal integration can expand the dynamical range of ratio-sensing. Finally, we investigated the influence of circuit topology on ratio-sensing and found that incorporating negative auto-regulation and/or coherent feedforward loop motifs to the basic signal integration unit can tune the sensitivity of the response to the external nutrient signals. Our study not only deepened our understanding of how ratio-sensing is achieved in yeast GAL metabolic regulation, but also elucidated design principles for ratio-sensing signal processing that can be used in other biological settings, such as being introduced into circuit designs for synthetic biology applications.\n\nAuthor summaryMicrobes make sophisticated choices about the uptake and metabolism of nutrients depending on the variety of nutrient choices available to them in their environment. In the well-studied yeast galactose utilization network, a recent study has shown that galactose metabolic genes respond to the external concentration ratio of galactose to glucose. Using computational models, we showed that this type of phenomenon could arise from a competition between galactose and glucose for transporters, a competition between transcription factors for promoters, or a combination of these two mechanisms. We further revealed the controlling parameters that determined the system sensitivity towards competing input signals and that determined the concentration ratio required to induce the metabolic network in each scenario. Combining competition inhibition at both the transporter level and the transcriptional level can enlarge the ratio-sensing regime, resulting a robust signal integration module. We suspect that modules of this kind may be common in many areas of biology.",

    "abstract": "The Shumiya cataract rat (SCR) is a model for hereditary cataract. Two-third of these rats develop lens opacity within 10-11-weeks. Onset of cataract is attributed to the synergetic effect of lanosterol synthase (Lss) and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (Fdft1) mutant alleles that lead to cholesterol deficiency in the lenses, which in turn adversely affects lens biology including the growth and differentiation of lens epithelial cells (LECs). Nevertheless, the molecular events and changes in gene expression associated with the onset of lens opacity in SCR is poorly understood. In the present study, a microarray-based approach was employed to analyze comparative gene expression changes in LECs isolated from the pre-cataractous and cataractous stages of lenses of 5-, 8- and 10-week-old SCRs. The changes in gene expression observed in microarray results in the LECs were further validated using real-time PCR and western blot analyses. Lens opacity was not observed in 5-week-old rats. However, histological analysis revealed mild dysplasia in the anterior suture and poorly differentiated fiber cells at the bow region. Expression of approximately 100 genes, including major intrinsic protein of lens fiber (MIP and Aquaporin0), deoxyribonuclease II beta (Dnase2b), heat shock protein B1 (Hspb1), and crystallin {gamma} ({gamma}Cry) B, C, and F were found to be significantly downregulated (0.07-0.5 fold) in rat LECs derived from cataract lenses compared to that in noncataractous lenses (control). Thus, our study aimed to identify the gene expression patterns during cataract formation in SCRs, which may be responsible for cataractogenesis in SCR. We proposed that mutation in lanosterol synthase was responsible for the downregulation of genes associated with lens fiber differentiation, which in turn leads to the formation of cataract in these rats. Our findings may have wider implications in understanding the effect of cholesterol deficiency and the role of cholesterol-lowering therapeutics on cataractogenesis.",

Quantitative metrics previously proposed in literature are not always effective in discriminating the success or failure of an experiment, thus hampering objectivity and reproducibility of quality control. Here we introduce ChIC, a new framework for ChIP-seq data quality assessment that overcomes the limitations of previous solutions. ChIC is the first method for ChIP-seq quality control directly considering the enrichment profile shape, thus achieving good performances on ChIP targets yielding sharp and broad peaks alike. We integrate a comprehensive set of quality control metrics into one single score reliably summarizing the sample quality. The ChIC score is based on a machine learning classifier trained on a compendium with thousands of ChIP-seq profiles, which can also be used as a reference for easier evaluation of new datasets. ChIC is implemented as a user-friendly R/Bioconductor package.",

To offer fast isolation and shortened early development, a large human naive phage display antibody library, was built and used to screen specific nAbs to the receptor-binding domain, RBD, the key for Covid-19 virus entry through a human receptor, ACE2. The obtained RBD-specific antibodies were characterized by epitope mapping, FACS and neutralization assay. Some of the antibodies demonstrated spike-neutralizing property and ACE2-competitiveness.

An increasing number of evidence indicate a relatively high prevalence of superinfections associated with COVID-19, including invasive aspergillosis, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be characterized. In the present study, to better understand the biological impact of superinfection we sought to determine and compare the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 versus Aspergillus superinfection, using a model of reconstituted humain airway epithelium. Our analyses reveal that both simple infection and superinfection induce a strong deregulation of core components of innate immune and inflammatory responses, with a stronger response to superinfection in the bronchial epithelial model compared to its nasal counterpart. Our results also highlight unique transcriptional footprints of SARS-CoV-2 Aspergillus superinfection, such as an imbalanced type I/type III IFN, and an induction of several monocyte- and neutrophil associated chemokines, that could be useful for the understanding of Aspergillus-associated COVID-19 and but also management of severe forms of aspergillosis in this specific context.",

    "abstract": "Considering the current status of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, sequence variations and possibly structural changes in the rapidly evolving SARS-CoV-2 is highly expected in the coming months. The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is responsible for mediating viral attachment and fusion with cell membranes. Mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S-protein occur at the most variable part of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, and specific sites of S-protein have undergone positive selection impacting the viral pathogenicity. In the present work, we used high-throughput computation to design 100,000 mutants in RBD interfacial residues and identify novel affinity-enhancing and affinity-weakening mutations. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can establish a higher rate of infectivity and pathogenesis when it acquires combinatorial mutations at the interfacial residues in RBD. Mapping of the mutational landscape of the interaction site suggests that a few of these residues are the hot-spot residues with a very high tendency to undergo positive selection. Knowledge of the affinity-enhancing mutations may guide the identification of potential cold-spots for this mutation as targets for developing a possible therapeutic strategy instead of hot-spots, and vice versa. Understanding of the molecular interactions between the virus and host protein presents a detailed systems view of viral infection mechanisms. The applications of the present research can be explored in multiple antiviral strategies, including monoclonal antibody therapy, vaccine design, and importantly in understanding the clinical pathogenesis of the virus itself. Our work presents research directions for the exploitation of non-conventional solutions for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Since spilling over into humans, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe, accumulating significant genetic diversity. The structure of this genetic diversity, and whether it reveals epidemiological insights, are fundamental questions for understanding the evolutionary trajectory of this virus. Here we use a recently developed phylodynamic approach to uncover phylogenetic structures underlying the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We find support for three SARS-CoV-2 lineages co-circulating, each with significantly different demographic dynamics concordant with known epidemiological factors. For example, Lineage C emerged in Europe with a high growth rate in late February, just prior to the exponential increase in cases in several European countries. Mutations that characterize Lineage C in particular are non-synonymous and occur in functionally important gene regions responsible for viral replication and cell entry. Even though Lineages A and B had distinct demographic patterns, they were much more difficult to distinguish. Continuous application of phylogenetic approaches to track the evolutionary epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 lineages will be increasingly important to validate the efficacy of control efforts and monitor significant evolutionary events in the future.",

    "abstract": "The need for antiviral drugs is real and relevant. Broad spectrum antiviral drugs have a particular advantage when dealing with rapid disease outbreaks, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic. Since viruses are completely dependent on internal cell mechanisms, they must cross cell membranes during their lifecycle, creating a dependence on processes involving membrane dynamics. Thus, in this study we examined whether the synthesis of glycosphingolipids, biologically active components of cell membranes, can serve as an antiviral therapeutic target. We examined the antiviral effect of two specific inhibitors of GlucosylCeramide synthase (GCS); (i) Genz-123346, an analogue of the FDA-approved drug Cerdelga(R), (ii) GENZ-667161, an analogue of venglustat which is currently under phase III clinical trials. We found that both GCS inhibitors inhibit the replication of four different enveloped RNA viruses of different genus, organ-target and transmission route: (i) Neuroinvasive Sindbis virus (SVNI), (ii) West Nile virus (WNV), (iii) Influenza A virus, and (iv) SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, GCS inhibitors significantly increase the survival rate of SVNI-infected mice. Our data suggest that GCS inhibitors can potentially serve as a broad-spectrum antiviral therapy and should be further examined in preclinical and clinical trial. Analogues of the specific compounds tested have already been studied clinically, implying they can be fast-tracked for public use. With the current COVID-19 pandemic, this may be particularly relevant to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAn analogue of Cerdelga(R), an FDA-approved drug, is effective against a broad range of RNA-viruses including the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2.",

The present investigation comprised of sixty-one genotypes of basil was undertaken to characterize the genotypes based on morphological and phenological features, herbs and essential oil yield of genotypes. A wide range of variations for traits like days to first cutting (56.92-101.6), plant height (13.67-71.90 cm), branch number (3.28-19.43 number/plant), fresh herb yields (12.94-274.11 g/plant), and essential oil yield (0.04-1.71%) were observed and can be useful for breeding purposes.

Importantly, all these 13 antibodies could block pseudoviral entry into HEK293T cells overexpressing ACE2, with the best ones showing IC50s around 2-3 nM. We further identified 8 neutralizing antibodies against authentic virus with IC50s within 10 nM. Among these, 414-1 blocked authentic viral entry at IC50 of 1.75 nM and in combination with 105-38 could achieve IC50 as low as 0.45 nM. Meanwhile, we also found that 3 antibodies could cross-react with the SARS-CoV spike protein. Altogether, our study provided a panel of potent human neutralizing antibodies for COVID19 as therapeutics candidates for further development.",

    "abstract": "Current mouse models for evaluating the efficacy of live oral cholera vaccines (OCVs) have important limitations. Conventionally raised adult mice are resistant to intestinal colonization by Vibrio cholerae, but germ-free mice can be colonized and have been used to study OCV immunogenicity. However, germ free animals have impaired immune systems and intestinal physiology; also, live OCVs colonize germ free mice for many months, which does not mimic the clearance kinetics of live OCVs in humans. Here, we leverage antibiotic-treated, conventionally raised adult mice to study the effects of transient intestinal colonization by a live OCV V. cholerae strain. In a single dose vaccination regimen, we found that HaitiV, a live-attenuated OCV candidate, was cleared by streptomycin treated adult mice within a week after oral inoculation. This transient colonization elicited far stronger adaptive immune correlates of protection against cholera than did inactivated whole-cell HaitiV. Infant mice from HaitiV vaccinated dams were also significantly protected from choleric disease than pups from inactivated-HaitiV dams. Our findings establish the benefits of antibiotic treated mice for live OCV studies as well as its limitations and underscore the immunogenicity of HaitiV.\n\nImportanceOral cholera vaccines (OCVs) are being deployed to combat cholera but current killed OCVs require multiple doses and show little efficacy in young children. Live OCVs have the potential to overcome these limitations but small animal models for testing OCVs have shortcomings. We used an antibiotic treatment protocol for conventional adult mice to study the effects of short-term colonization by a single dose of HaitiV, a live OCV candidate. Vaccinated mice developed vibriocidal antibodies against V. cholerae and delivered pups that were resistant to cholera, whereas mice vaccinated with inactivated HaitiV did not. These findings demonstrate HaitiVs immunogenicity and suggest that this antibiotic treatment protocol will be useful for evaluating the efficacy of live OCVs.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila extensively modulates the host ubiquitin network to create the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) for its replication. Many of its virulence factors function as ubiquitin ligases or deubiquitinases (DUBs). Here we identified Lem27 as a DUB that displays a preference for diubiquitin formed by K6, K11 or K48. Lem27 is associated with the LCV where it regulates Rab10 ubiquitination in concert with SidC and SdcA, two bacterial E3 ubiquitin ligases. Structural analysis of the complex formed by an active fragment of Lem27 and the substrate-based suicide inhibitor ubiquitin-propargylamide (PA) reveals that it harbors a fold resembling those in the OTU1 DUB subfamily with a Cys-His catalytic dyad and that it recognizes ubiquitin via extensive hydrogen bonding at six contact sites. Our results establish Lem27 as a deubiquitinase that functions to regulate protein ubiquitination on L. pneumophila phagosomes by counteracting the activity of bacterial ubiquitin E3 ligases.",

    "abstract": "The segmented 18.5-kB dsRNA genome of rotavirus expresses 6 structural and 6 nonstructural proteins. We investigated the possibility of using the recently-developed plasmid-based rotavirus reverse genetics (RG) system to generate recombinant viruses that express a separate foreign protein, in addition to the 12 viral proteins. To address this, we replaced the NSP3 open-reading-frame (ORF) of the segment 7 (pT7/NSP3) transcription vector used in the RG system with an ORF encoding NSP3 fused to a fluorescent reporter protein (i.e., UnaG, mRuby, mKate, or TagBFP). Inserted at the fusion junction was a teschovirus 2A-like self-cleaving element designed to direct the separate expression of NSP3 and the fluorescent protein. Recombinant rotaviruses made with the modified pT7/NSP3 vectors were well growing, generally genetically stable, and expressed NSP3 and a separate fluorescent protein detectable by live cell imaging. NSP3 made by the recombinant viruses was functional, inducing nuclear accumulation of cellular poly(A)-binding protein. Further modification of the NSP3 ORF showed that it was possible to generate recombinant viruses encoding 2 foreign proteins (mRuby and UnaG) in addition to NSP3. Our results demonstrate that, through modification of segment 7, the rotavirus genome can be increased in size to at least 19.8 kB and can be used to produce recombinant rotaviruses expressing a full complement of viral proteins and multiple foreign proteins. The generation of recombinant rotaviruses expressing fluorescent proteins will be valuable for the study of rotavirus replication and pathogenesis by live cell imagining and suggest that rotaviruses may prove useful as expression vectors.\n\nImportanceRotaviruses are a major cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children. Recently, a highly efficient reverse genetics system was developed that allows genetic manipulation of the rotavirus segmented double-stranded RNA genome. Using the reverse genetics system, we show that it is possible to modify one of the rotavirus genome segments (segment 7) such that virus gains the capacity to express a separate foreign protein, in addition to the full complement of viral proteins. Through this approach, we have generated wildtype-like rotaviruses that express various fluorescent reporter proteins, including UnaG (green), mRuby (far red), mKate (red), and TagBFP (blue). Such strains will be of value in probing rotavirus biology and pathogenesis by live-cell imagining techniques. Notably, our work indicates that the rotavirus genome is remarkably flexible and able to accommodate significant amounts of foreign RNA sequence, raising the possibility of using the virus as vaccine expression vector.",

    "abstract": "Potential rate assays are used in soil microbial ecology to determine the rates of a functional process in environmental samples under a defined set of conditions. While they can be used appropriately to provide mechanistic insights, potential rates are also often used to estimate the abundance of specific taxonomic groups and their in situ activity. These estimates incorrectly assume that all contributing organisms in a community are active at a maximum rate under one set of  optimal incubation conditions and that potential rates reflect activity in the soil. While investigators now recognise that populations within communities are physiologically diverse, they often ignore the consequent suboptimal activity, or even inactivity, of the majority of community members performing that function. In this short perspective article, we discuss when potential assays can be informative and highlight the underlying conceptual problems under circumstances where potential assays are misused, using potential nitrification rate (PNR) as an example. PNR was originally developed to estimate the size of active ammonia oxidising communities in environmental samples. It is routinely determined in short-term shaken slurry incubations by measuring assumed maximum rates of nitrate or nitrite production under optimal, non-substrate-limiting conditions. As with other functional processes, it is now recognised that a broad diversity of organisms contribute to aerobic ammonia oxidation in terrestrial and other habitats, and this diversity represents a substantial range of physiologies, including variation in substrate affinity, ammonia tolerance, cell specific activity and substrate preference. Despite this, PNR, and other potential rate assays, are often inappropriately used in an attempt to determine an ecologically relevant measurement of activity in soil. As with any potential assay, PNR has inherent biases towards particular functional groups and its use in investigating the ecology of ammonia oxidisers in natural systems should be carefully considered.",

    "abstract": "The Serine Incorporator (SERINC) proteins are multipass transmembrane proteins that affect sphingolipid and phosphatidylserine synthesis. Human SERINC5 and SERINC3 were recently shown to possess antiretroviral activity to a number of retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), murine leukemia virus (MLV) and equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV). In the case of MLV, the glycosylated Gag (glyco-Gag) protein was found to counteract SERINC5-mediated restriction in in vitro experiments and that the viral envelope determines virion sensitivity or resistance to SERINC5. However, nothing is known about the in vivo function of SERINC5. Antiretroviral function of a host factor in vitro is not always associated with antiretroviral function in vivo. Using SERINC5-/- mice we generated, we show that mouse SERINC5 (mSERINC5) restriction of MLV infection in vivo is dependent not only on glyco-Gag, but also on the retroviral envelope. Finally, we also examined the in vivo function of the other SERINC gene with known antiretroviral functions, SERINC3. By using SERINC3-/- mice, we found that the murine homologue, mSERINC3, had no antiretroviral role both in vivo and in vitro. This report provides the first data showing that SERINC5 restricts retrovirus infection in vivo and that restriction of retrovirus infectivity in vivo is dependent on both the presence of glyco-Gag and the viral envelope.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis study examines for the first time the in vivo function of the Serine Incorporator (SERINC) proteins during retrovirus infection. SERINC3/5 restrict a number of retroviruses including human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and murine leukemia virus (MLV) by blocking their entry into cells. Nevertheless, HIV-1 and MLV encode factors, Nef and glycosylated Gag respectively, that counteract SERINC3/5 in vitro. We recently developed SERINC3 and SERINC5 knockout mice to examine the in vivo function of these genes. We found that SERINC5 potently restricted retrovirus infection in a glycosylated Gag and envelope dependent manner. On the other hand, SERINC3 had no antiviral function. Our findings have implication in the development of therapeutics that target SERINC5 during retrovirus infection.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial flagellar motor is a remarkable nanomachine that can rapidly rotate in both counter-clockwise (CCW) and clockwise (CW) senses. The transitions between CCW and CW rotation are critical for chemotaxis, and they are controlled by a signaling protein (CheY-P) that interacts with a switch complex at the cytoplasmic side of the flagellar motor. However, the exact molecular mechanism by which CheY-P controls the motor rotational switch remains enigmatic. Here, we use the Lyme disease spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, as the model system to dissect the mechanism underlying flagellar rotational switching. We first determined high resolution in situ motor structures in the cheX and cheY3 mutants in which motors are genetically locked in CCW or CW rotation. The structures showed that the CheY3 protein of B. burgdorferi interacts directly with the FliM protein of the switch complex in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. The binding of CheY3-P to FliM induces a major remodeling of the switch protein FliG2 that alters its interaction with the torque generator. Because the remodeling of FliG2 is directly correlated with the rotational direction, our data lead to a model for flagellar function in which the torque generator rotates in response to an inward flow of H+ driven by the proton motive force. Rapid conformational changes of FliG2 allow the switch complex to interact with opposite sides of the rotating torque generator, thereby facilitating rotational switching between CW and CCW.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms and burrowing animals exert a pronounced impact on the cycling of redox sensitive metals in coastal sediments. Sedimentary metal cycling is likely controlled by seasonal processes including changes in temperature, animal feeding behavior due to food availability, and availability of organic matter in sediments. We hypothesized that the iron biogeochemical cycle and associated sedimentary microbial community will respond to seasonal changes in a bioturbated intertidal mudflat. In this study, we monitored the spatiotemporal dynamics of porewater and highly reactive solid phase iron with the corresponding prokaryotic and eukaryotic sedimentary microbial communities over one annual cycle from November 2015 to November 2016. Continuous and seasonally variable pools of both porewater Fe(II) and highly reactive iron (FeHR) were observed throughout the season with significant increases of Fe(II) and FeHR in response to increased sediment temperature in summer months. Maximum concentrations of Fe(II) and FeHR were predominantly confined to the upper 5 cm of sediment throughout the season. Iron-oxidizing and -reducing microorganisms were present and stable throughout the season, and exhibited strong depth-dependent stratification likely due to availability of Fe(II) and FeHR pools, respectively. Otherwise, the community was dominated by Deltaproteobacteria, which are involved in sulfur and potentially iron cycling, as well as Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The microbial community was relatively stable throughout the seasonal cycle, but showed strong separation with depth, probably driven by changes in oxygen availability and organic matter. The relative abundance of diatoms revealed a noticeable seasonal signature, which we attribute to spring and fall blooms recorded in the sediments. Macro-, meio, and microfauna were detected throughout the season with some seasonal variations that may influence sedimentary iron transformations by active microbial grazing. The seasonal dynamics of the sedimentary iron cycle are controlled by numerous, interdependent processes, with macrobiota-microbiota relationships and depth stratification comprising primary components. Deciphering these processes in natural ecosystems is essential to understand how they might respond to future environmental perturbations, such as anthropogenic nutrient release to coastal systems.",

The pipeline identified 119 microbial genera per HPP sample on average with 65 genera present in all samples.

    "abstract": "The major human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes shares an intimate evolutionary history with mobile genetic elements, which in many cases, carry genes encoding bacterial virulence factors. During recent whole genome sequencing of a longitudinal sample of S. pyogenes isolates in the United Kingdom, we identified a lineage within emm4 that clustered with the reference genome MEW427. Like MEW427, this lineage was characterised by substantial gene loss within all three prophage regions, compared to MGAS10750 and isolates outside of the MEW427-like lineage. Gene loss primarily affected lysogeny, replicatory and regulatory modules, and to a lesser and more variable extent, structural genes. Importantly, prophage-encoded superantigen and DNase genes were retained in all isolates. In isolates where the prophage elements were complete, like MGAS10750, they could be induced experimentally, but not in MEW427-like isolates with degraded prophages. We also found gene loss within the chromosomal island SpyCIM4 of MEW427-like isolates, although surprisingly, the SpyCIM4 element could not be experimentally induced in either MGAS10750-like or MEW427-like isolates. This did not, however, appear to abolish expression of the mismatch repair operon, within which this element resides. The inclusion of further emm4 genomes in our analyses ratified our observations and revealed an international emm4 lineage characterised by prophage degradation. Intriguingly, the USA population of emm4 S. pyogenes appeared to constitute predominantly MEW427-like isolates, whereas the UK comprised both MEW427-like and MGAS10750-like strains. The degradation and cryptic nature of these elements may have important phenotypic ramifications for emm4 S. pyogenes and the geographical distribution of this lineage raises interesting questions on the population dynamics of the genotype.\n\nData summaryAll raw sequence data used in this study has been previously published and was obtained from NCBI short read archive.

This study focuses on the dissemination of plasmid-borne carbapenemase genes in Gram-negative bacteria in Tamil Nadu, India. A total of 151 non-repetitive isolates belonging to 11 genera were collected from a diagnostic center in Tamil Nadu. E. coli (n=57) isolates were classified as, Enteropathogenic (n=12), Enteroaggregative (n=9), Enterohemorrhagic (n=8), Enterotoxigenic (n=3), Enteroinvasive (n=1) and unclassified E. coli (n=24). Of the 45 Klebsiella species, 14 were K1 whereas 11 were K2 serotype and in 20 Klebsiella serotype could not be determined. Other isolates (n=49) consisted of P. aeruginosa, S. typhi, E. cloacae, A. baumannii, S. marcescens, A. xylosoxidans, P. mirabilis and E. meningoseptica. Of the 151 isolates, 71% (n=107) and 68% (n=103) were found to be resistant to meropenem and imipenem respectively. The most prevalent beta-lactamase gene was blaNDM-1 (21%, 12/57) followed by blaOXA-181 (16%, 9/57), blaGES-9 (n=8), blaOXA-23 (n=7), blaIMP-1 (n=3), blaGES-1 (n=11) and blaOXA-51 (n=9). The unusual presence of blaOXA-23 was seen in E. coli (n=4), and blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-51 (IncA/C) in K. pneumoniae (n=3). Plasmid incompatibility (inc/rep) typing results showed that the plasmids carrying resistance genes (n=11) belonged to IncX, IncA/C, IncFIA-FIB and IncFIIA groups.

    "abstract": "Bacteria encompass three types of structurally related SMC complexes referred to as condensins. Smc-ScpAB is present in most bacteria while MukBEF is found in enterobacteria and MksBEF is scattered over the phylogenic tree. The contributions of these condensins to chromosome management were characterized in Pseudomonas aeruginosa that carries both Smc-ScpAB and MksBEF. In this bacterium, SMC-ScpAB controls chromosome disposition by juxtaposing chromosome arms. In contrast, MksBEF is critical for chromosome segregation in the absence of the main segregation system and affects the higher-order architecture of the chromosome by promoting DNA contacts in the megabase range. Strikingly, our results reveal a prevalence of Smc-ScpAB over MksBEF involving a coordination of their activities with the DNA replication process. They also show that E. coli MukBEF can substitute for MksBEF in P. aeruginosa while prevailing over Smc-ScpAB. Altogether, our results reveal a hierarchy between activities of bacterial condensins on the same chromosome.",

    "abstract": "Lactobacillus reuteri is a model symbiont colonizing the guts of vertebrates used for studies on host adaptation of the gut symbiont. Previous studies investigated host-specific phylogenetic and functional properties by isolating its genomic sequence. This dependency on genome isolation is a significant bottleneck. Here we propose a method to study the association between L. reuteri and its hosts directly from metagenomic reads without strain isolation by using pan-genomes.\n\nWe characterized the host-specificity of L. reuteri in metagenomic samples not only in the previously studied organisms (mice and pigs) but additionally in dogs. For each sample, two types of profiles were generated: (1) genome-based strain type abundance profiles and (2) gene composition profiles. Our profiles showed host-association of L. reuteri in both phylogenetic and functional aspects without depending on the host-specific genome isolation. We could observe not only the presence of host-specific lineages but also the dominant lineages associated with the different hosts.\n\nFurthermore, we show that metagenome-assembled genomes provide detailed insights into the host-specificity of L. reuteri. We could infer evolutionary trajectories of host-associative L. reuteri strains in the metagenomic samples by placing the metagenome-assembled genomes into a phylogenetic tree and identify novel host-specific genes which were unannotated in existing pan-genome databases.\n\nOur pan-genomic approach drops the need for time-consuming and expensive host-specific genome isolation while producing consistent results with previous host-association findings in mice and pigs. Additionally, we could predict associations that have not yet been studied in dogs.",

    "abstract": "Most clinical drugs are based on microbial natural products, with compound classes including polyketides (PKS), non-ribosomal peptides (NRPS), fluoroquinones and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). While variants of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for known classes of natural products are easy to identify in genome sequences, BGCs for new compound classes escape attention. In particular, evidence is accumulating that for RiPPs, subclasses known thus far may only represent the tip of an iceberg. Here, we present decRiPPter (Data-driven Exploratory Class-independent RiPP TrackER), a RiPP genome mining algorithm aimed at the discovery of novel RiPP classes. DecRiPPter combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies candidate RiPP precursors with pan-genomic analyses to identify which of these are encoded within operon-like structures that are part of the accessory genome of a genus. Subsequently, it prioritizes such regions based on the presence of new enzymology and based on patterns of gene cluster and precursor peptide conservation across species. We then applied decRiPPter to mine 1,295 Streptomyces genomes, which led to the identification of 42 new candidate RiPP families that could not be found by existing programs. One of these was studied further and elucidated as a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides, designated Class V. Two previously unidentified modifying enzymes are proposed to create the hallmark lanthionine bridges. Taken together, our work highlights how novel natural product families can be discovered by methods going beyond sequence similarity searches to integrate multiple pathway discovery criteria.\n\nCode and data availabilityThe source code of DecRiPPter is freely available online at https://github.com/Alexamk/decRiPPter.

    "abstract": "Pulmonary damage by Pseudomonas aeruginosa during cystic fibrosis lung infection and ventilator-associated pneumonia is mediated both by pathogen virulence factors and host inflammation. Impaired immune function due to tissue damage and inflammation, coupled with pathogen multidrug resistance, complicates management of these deep-seated infections. Therefore, preservation of lung function and effective immune clearance may be enhanced by selectively controlling inflammation. Pathological inflammation during P. aeruginosa pneumonia is driven by interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}). This proinflammatory cytokine is canonically regulated by caspase-family inflammasome proteases, but we report that plasticity in IL-1{beta} proteolytic activation allows for its direct maturation by the pseudomonal protease LasB. LasB promotes IL-1{beta} activation, neutrophilic inflammation, and destruction of lung architecture characteristic of severe P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection. Discovery of this IL-1{beta} regulatory mechanism provides a distinct target for anti-inflammatory therapeutics, such that matrix metalloprotease inhibitors blocking LasB limit inflammation and pathology during P. aeruginosa pulmonary infections.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIL-1{beta} drives pathology during pulmonary infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.\nC_LIO_LIThe Pseudomonas protease LasB cleaves and activates IL-1{beta} independent of canonical and noncanonical inflammasomes\nC_LIO_LIMetalloprotease inhibitors active against LasB limit inflammation and bacterial growth\nC_LI\n\nResearch in ContextInflammation is highly damaging during lung infections by the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Sun et al. demonstrate that the Pseudomonas LasB protease directly activates IL-1{beta} in an inflammasome-independent manner. Inhibition of IL-1{beta} conversion by LasB protects against neutrophilic inflammation and destruction of the lung. Adjunctive therapeutics that limit pathological inflammation induced by infection would be beneficial for the treatment of pulmonary infections when used with conventional antibiotics.",

    "abstract": "Major efforts on pooled library CRISPR knockout screening across hundreds of cell lines have identified genes whose disruption leads to fitness defects, a critical step in identifying candidate cancer targets. However, the number of essential genes detected from these monogenic knockout screens are very low compared to the number of constitutively expressed genes in a cell, raising the question of why there are so few essential genes. Through a systematic analysis of screen data in cancer cell lines generated by the Cancer Dependency Map, we observed that half of all constitutively-expressed genes are never hits in any CRISPR screen, and that these never-essentials are highly enriched for paralogs. We investigated paralog buffering through systematic dual-gene CRISPR knockout screening by testing algorithmically defined ~400 candidate paralog pairs with the enCas12a multiplex knockout system in three cell lines. We observed 24 synthetic lethal paralog pairs which have escaped detection by monogenic knockout screens at stringent thresholds. Nineteen of 24 (79%) synthetic lethal interactions were present in at least two out of three cell lines and 14 of 24 (58%) were present in all three cell lines tested, including alternate subunits of stable protein complexes as well as functionally redundant enzymes. Together these observations strongly suggest that paralogs represent a targetable set of genetic dependencies that are systematically under-represented among cell-essential genes due to genetic buffering in monogenic CRISPR-based mammalian functional genomics approaches.",
