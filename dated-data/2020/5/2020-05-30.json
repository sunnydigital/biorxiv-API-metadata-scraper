    "abstract": "We measured the dynamics of decision-making by a minimal bistable gene network integrated in a synthetic cell model, free of external perturbations. Reducing the number of gene copies from 105 to about 10 per cell revealed a transition from deterministic and slow computation to a fuzzy and rapid regime dominated by singleprotein fluctuations. Fuzzy computation appeared at DNA and protein concentrations 100-fold lower than necessary in equilibrium, suggesting rate enhancement by co-expressional localization. Whereas the high-copy regime was characterized by a sharp transition, hysteresis and robust memory, the low-copy limit showed incipient strong fluctuations, switching between states, and a signature of cellular individuality across the decision-making point. Our work establishes synthetic cells operating rapidly at the single molecule level to integrate gene regulatory networks with metabolic pathways for sustained survival with low energetic cost.One Sentence Summary Decision-making in a synthetic cell can be slow and precise or rapid and probabilistic by reducing the number of computing molecules by five decades down to single-molecule fluctuations.Competing Interest StatementThe Noireaux laboratory receives research funds from Arbor Biosciences, a distributor of the myTXTL cell-free protein synthesis kit.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Environmental impacts of the 1986 Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident are much debated, but the effects of radiation on host microbiomes has received little attention to date. We present the first analysis of small mammal gut microbiome from the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in relation to total absorbed dose rate and including caecum as well as faeces sample. The associations between microbiome communities and radiation exposure varied between host species. Associations between microbiome and radiation was different for analyses based on ambient versus total weighted absorbed dose rates. We found considerable variation between patterns for faecal and gut samples of bank voles, suggesting faecal samples are not an accurate indicator of gut composition. For bank vole guts, associations between radiation and bacterial community composition were robust against geographical and habitat variation. We found limited associations between radiation and fungal communities. Host physiological mechanisms or environmental factors may be driving these patterns.",

    "abstract": "The human fallopian tube harbors the cell-of-origin for the majority of high-grade serous  ovarian cancers (HGSCs), but its cellular composition, particularly the epithelial component, is poorly characterized. We performed single-cell transcriptomic profiling in 12 primary fallopian specimens from 8 patients, analyzing around 53,000 individual cells to map the major immune, fibroblastic and epithelial cell types present in this organ. We identified 10 epithelial sub-populations, characterized by diverse transcriptional programs including SOX17 (enriched in secretory epithelial cells), TTF3 and RFX3 (enriched in ciliated cells) and NR2F2 (enriched in early, partially differentiated secretory cells). Based on transcriptional signatures, we reconstructed a trajectory whereby secretory cells differentiate into ciliated cells via a RUNX3high intermediate. Computational deconvolution of the cellular composition of advanced HGSCs based on epithelial subset signatures identified the  early secretory population as a likely precursor state for the majority of HGSCs. The signature of this rare population of cells comprised both epithelial (EPCAM, KRT) and mesenchymal (THY1, ACTA2) features, and was enriched in mesenchymal-type HGSCs (P = 6.7 x 10-27), a group known to have particularly poor prognoses. This cellular and molecular compendium of the human fallopian tube in cancer-free women is expected to advance our understanding of the earliest stages of fallopian epithelial neoplasia.",

This study investigated whether aged mice express behavioural and physiological changes indicative of an apathy phenotype. Using measures of motivation to work for reward, we found deficits in the progressive ratio task related to rate of responding. In an effort for reward task, aged mice were less willing to exert effort for high value reward. Aged mice exhibited reduced reward sensitivity and expressed lower measures of anxiety in the novelty supressed feeding test. In a test of cognition (novel object recognition) aged mice showed no impairments but activity was lower in a measure of exploration in a novel environment. Aged mice also showed an attenuated response to restraint stress with lower corticosterone and reduced paraventricular nucleus c-fos activation. Together, these data suggest aged mice show reduced goal-directed behaviour and reduced reward sensitivity and stress reactivity, reflective of emotional blunting and may be a suitable model for pre-clinical apathy research.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsBLAbasolateral amygdalaCeAcentral amygdalaCORTcorticosteroneEBDMeffort-based decision makingEfReffort for rewardESElectrosprayHLPChigh performance liquid chromatographyMSmass spectrometryNORTnovel object recognition testNSFTnovelty supressed feeding testPRprogressive ratioPVNparaventricular nucleus of the hypothalamusSPTsucrose preference testView Full Text",

The foundation of this design process is an integration of computer aided design (CAD) tools that allow rapid geometric modifications with robust simulation tools to guide design iterations (i.e. computer-aided engineering, CAE). Recently, DNA has been used to make nanodevices for a myriad of applications across fields including medicine, nanomanufacturing, synthetic biology, biosensing, and biophysics. However, currently these self-assembled DNA nanodevices rely primarily on geometric design, and hence, they have not demonstrated the same sophistication as real-life products. We present an iterative design pipeline for DNA assemblies that integrates CAE based on coarse-grained molecular dynamics with a versatile CAD approach that combines top-down automation with bottom-up control over geometry. This intuitive framework redefines the scope of structural complexity and enhances mechanical and dynamic design of DNA assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Homologous proteins are often compared by pairwise sequence alignment, and structure superposition if the atomic coordinates are available. Unification of sequence and structure data is an important task in structural biology. Here, we present Sequence Similarity 3D (SS3D), a new method for integrating sequence and structure information for comparison of homologous proteins. SS3D quantifies the spatial similarity of residues within a given radius of homologous through-space contacts. The spatial alignments are scored using native BLOSUM and PAM substitution matrices. This work details the SS3D approach and demonstrates its utility through case studies comparing members of several protein families: GPCR, p53, kelch, SUMO, and SARS coronavirus spike protein. We show that SS3D can more clearly highlight biologically important regions of similarity and dissimilarity compared to pairwise sequence alignments or structure superposition alone. SS3D is written in C++, and is available with a manual and tutorial at https://github.com/0x462e41/SS3D/.",

With this approach, we could rapidly and accurately cluster a set of DNA sequenced isolates, with a known epidemiological relationship to confirm the clustering. Functions were built to allow for both high-accuracy methylation-aware base-called MinION reads (hac_m Q10) and fast generated lower-quality reads (fast Q8) to be used, also in combination with Illumina data. With fast Q8 reads a higher number of base pairs were excluded from the calculated distance matrix, compared to the high-accuracy methylation-aware Q10 base-calling of ONT data. Nonetheless, when using different qualities of ONT data with corresponding input parameters, the clustering of isolates were nearly identical.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAging is a multifactorial process that affects multiple tissues and is characterized by changes in homeostasis over time, leading to increased morbidity. Whole blood gene expression signatures have been associated with aging and have been used to gain information on its biological mechanisms, which are still not fully understood. However, blood is composed of many cell types whose proportions in blood vary with age. As a result, previously observed associations between gene expression levels and aging might be driven by cell type composition rather than intracellular aging mechanisms. To overcome this, previous aging studies already accounted for major cell types, but the possibility that the reported associations are false positives driven by less prevalent cell subtypes remains.\n\nResultsHere, we compared the regression model from our previous work to an extended model that corrects for 33 additional white blood cell subtypes. Both models were applied to whole blood gene expression data from 3165 individuals belonging to the general population (age range of 18-81 years). We evaluated that the new model is a better fit for the data and it identified fewer genes associated with aging (625, compared to the 2808 of the initial model; P [&le;] 2.5 x 10-6). Moreover, 511 genes ([~]18% of the 2,808 genes identified by the initial model) were found using both models, indicating that the other previously reported genes could be proxies for less abundant cell types. In particular, functional enrichment of the genes identified by the new model highlighted pathways and GO terms specifically associated with platelet activity.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that gene expression analyses in blood strongly benefit from correction for both common and rare blood cell types, and recommend using blood-cell count estimates as standard covariates when studying whole blood gene expression.",

    "abstract": "We report on the contributions of model factors that appear in fatal cancer risk projection models to the overall uncertainty in cancer risks predictions for exposures to galactic cosmic ray (GCR) in deep space. Annual GCR exposures to astronauts at solar minimum are considered. Uncertainties in low LET risk coefficients, dose and dose-rate modifiers, quality factors (QFs), space radiation organ doses, non-targeted effects (NTE) and increased tumor lethality at high LET compared to low LET radiation are considered. For the low LET reference radiation parameters we use a revised assessment of excess relative risk (ERR) and excess additive risk (EAR) for radiation induced cancers in the Life-Span Studies (LSS) of the Atomic bomb survivors that was recently reported, and also consider ERR estimates for males from the International Study of Nuclear Workers (INWORKS). For 45-y old females at mission age the risk of exposure induced death (REID) per year and 95% confidence intervals is predicted as 1.6% [0.71, 1.63] without QF uncertainties and 1.64% [0.69, 4.06] with QF uncertainties. However, fatal risk predictions increase to 5.83% [2.56, 9.7] with non-targeted effects. For males a comparison application to GCR using LSS or INWORKS lead to predictions of 1.24% [0.58, 3.14] and 2.45% [1.23, 5.9] without NTEs. The major conclusion of our report is that high LET risk prediction uncertainties due to QFs parameters, NTEs, and possible increase lethality at high LET are dominant contributions to GCR uncertainties and should be the focus of space radiation research.",

    "abstract": "Defining traits of platinum tolerant cancer cells could expose new treatment vulnerabilities. Here, new markers associated with platinum tolerant cells and tumors were identified by using in vitro and in vivo ovarian cancer (OC) models treated repetitively with carboplatin and validated in human specimens. Platinum-tolerant cells and tumors were found to be enriched in ALDH (+) cells, formed more spheroids, and expressed increased levels of stemness-related transcription factors compared to parental cells. Additionally, platinum-tolerant cells and tumors highly expressed the Wnt receptor, Frizzled 7 (FZD7). FZD7 knock down improved sensitivity to platinum, decreased spheroid formation, and delayed tumor initiation. The molecular signature distinguishing FZD7(+) from FZD7(-) cells included epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT), stemness, and oxidative phosphorylation enriched gene sets. Overexpression of FZD7 activated the oncogenic factor Tp63, driving upregulation of glutathione metabolism pathways, including glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which protects cells from chemotherapy-induced oxidative stress. FZD7(+) platinum-tolerant OC cells were more sensitive and underwent ferroptosis after treatment with GPX4 inhibitors. FZD7, Tp63 and glutathione metabolism gene sets were strongly correlated in the OC Tumor Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and in human OC specimens residual after chemotherapy. These results support the existence of a platinum-tolerant cell population with partial stem cell features, characterized by FZD7 expression and dependent on FZD7-{beta}-catenin-Tp63-GPX4 pathway for survival. The findings reveal a novel therapeutic vulnerability of platinum tolerant cancer cells and provide new insight into a potential \"persister cancer cell\" phenotype.",

A new technique for quantifying carbon exchange shows that CES comprised of an alga and diverse bacteria self-organize to robustly cycle carbon. Comparing a library of CES, we find that carbon cycling does not depend strongly on the taxonomy of the bacteria present. Metabolic profiling reveals functional redundancy across CES: despite strong taxonomic differences, self-organized CES exhibit a conserved set of metabolic capabilities.\n\nSummaryClosed microbial communities of algae and bacteria self-organize to robustly cycle carbon via emergent metabolite exchange.",

    "abstract": "Assessing the status and distribution of fish populations in rivers is essential for management and conservation efforts in these dynamic habitats. Currently, methods detecting environmental DNA (eDNA) are being established as an alternative and/or complementary approach to the traditional monitoring of fish species. In lotic systems, a sound understanding of hydrological conditions and their influence on the local target detection probability and DNA quantity is key for the interpretation of eDNA-based results. However, the effect of seasonal and diurnal changes in discharge and the comparability of semi-quantitative results between species remain hardly addressed. We conducted a cage experiment with four fish species (three salmonid and one cyprinid species) in a glacier-fed, fish-free river in Tyrol (Austria) during summer, fall, and winter discharge situations (i.e. 25-fold increase from winter to summer). Each season, water samples were obtained on three consecutive days at 13 locations downstream of the cages including lateral sampling every 1-2 m across the wetted width. Fish eDNA was quantified by species-specific endpoint PCR followed by capillary electrophoresis. Close to the cages, lateral eDNA distribution was heterogenous and mirrored cage placement within the stream. In addition to the diluting effect of increased discharge, longitudinal signal changes within the first 20 m were weakest at high discharge. For downstream locations with laterally homogenous eDNA distribution, the signals decreased significantly with increasing distance and discharge. Generally, the eDNA of the larger-bodied salmonid species was less frequently detected, and signal strengths were lower compared to the cyprinid species. This study exemplifies the importance of hydrological conditions for the interpretation of eDNA-based data across seasons. To control for heterogenous eDNA distribution and enable comparisons over time, sampling schemes in lotic habitats need to incorporate hydrological conditions and species traits.",

    "abstract": "The sea anemone Nematostella vectensis (Anthozoa, Cnidaria) is a powerful model system for characterizing the evolution of genes functioning in venom and nervous systems. Despite being an example for evolutionary novelty, the evolutionary origin of most toxins remains unknown. Here we report the first bona fide case of protein recruitment from the cnidarian nervous to venom system. The ShK-like1 peptide has ShKT cysteine motif, is lethal for fish larvae and packaged into nematocysts, the cnidarian venom-producing stinging capsules. Thus, ShK-like1 is a toxic venom component. Its paralog, ShK-like2, is a neuropeptide localized to neurons and is involved in development. Interestingly, both peptides exhibit similarities in their functional activities: both of them provoke contraction in Nematostella polyps and are toxic to fish. Because ShK-like2 but not ShK-like1 is conserved throughout sea anemone phylogeny, we conclude that the two paralogs originated due to a Nematostella-specific duplication of a ShK-like2 ancestor, a neuropeptide-encoding gene, followed by diversification and partial functional specialization. Strikingly, ShK-like2 is represented by two gene isoforms controlled by alternative promoters conferring regulatory flexibility throughout development. Additionally, we characterized the expression patterns of four other peptides with structural similarities to studied venom components, and revealed their unexpected neuronal localization. Thus, we employed genomics, transcriptomics and functional approaches to reveal one new venom component, five neuropeptides with two different cysteine motifs and an evolutionary pathway from nervous to venom system in Cnidaria.",

NTM infections are surging in recent years due to an increase in an immune-suppressed population, medical interventions, and patients with underlying lung diseases. Host regulators of innate immune responses, frontiers for controlling infections and dissemination, are poorly defined during NTM infections. Here, we describe the role of CBLB, an E3-ubiquitin ligase, for innate immune responses and disease progression in a mouse model of NTM infection under compromised T-cell immunity. We found that CBLB thwarted NTM growth and dissemination in a time- and infection route- dependent manner. Mechanistically, we uncovered defects in many innate immune cells in the absence of Cblb, including poor responses of NK cells, inflammatory monocytes, and conventional dendritic cells. Strikingly, Cblb-deficient macrophages were competent to control NTM growth in vitro. Histopathology suggested the lack of early formation of granulomatous inflammation in the absence of CBLB. Collectively, CBLB is essential to mount productive innate immune responses and help prevent the dissemination during an NTM infection under T-cell deficiency.",

A key target of these efforts is the spike (S) protein, a large trimeric class I fusion protein that is metastable and difficult to produce recombinantly in large quantities. Here, we designed and expressed over 100 structure-guided spike variants based upon a previously determined cryo-EM structure of the prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike. Biochemical, biophysical and structural characterization of these variants identified numerous individual substitutions that increased protein yields and stability. The best variant, HexaPro, has six beneficial proline substitutions leading to [~]10-fold higher expression than its parental construct and is able to withstand heat stress, storage at room temperature, and multiple freeze-thaws. A 3.2 [A]-resolution cryo-EM structure of HexaPro confirmed that it retains the prefusion spike conformation. High-yield production of a stabilized prefusion spike protein will accelerate the development of vaccines and serological diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "RNA polymerase (RNAP) encounters various roadblocks during transcription. These obstacles can impede RNAP movement, influence transcription, ultimately necessitating the activity of RNAP associated factors. One such factor is the bacterial protein Mfd; a highly conserved DNA translocase and evolvability factor that interacts with RNAP. Although Mfd is thought to function primarily in the repair of DNA lesions that stall RNAP, increasing evidence suggests that it may also be important for transcription regulation. However, this is yet to be fully characterized.\n\nTo shed light on Mfds in vivo functions, we identified the chromosomal regions where it associates. We analyzed Mfds impact on RNAP association and transcription regulation genome-wide. We found that Mfd represses RNAP association at many chromosomal regions. We found that these regions show increased RNAP pausing, suggesting that they are hard-to-transcribe. Interestingly, we noticed that the majority of the regions where Mfd regulates transcription contain highly structured regulatory RNAs. The RNAs identified regulate a myriad of biological processes, ranging from metabolism, to tRNA regulation, to toxin-antitoxin (TA) functions. We found that transcription regulation by Mfd, at least at some TA loci, is critical for cell survival. Lastly, we found that Mfd promotes mutagenesis in at least one toxin gene, suggesting that its function in regulating transcription may promote evolution of certain TA systems, and other regions containing strong RNA secondary structures. We conclude that Mfd is an RNAP co-factor that is important, and at times critical, for transcription regulation at hard-to-transcribe regions, especially those that express structured regulatory RNAs.\n\nSignificanceThe bacterial DNA translocase Mfd binds to stalled RNAPs and is generally thought to facilitate transcription-coupled DNA repair. Most of our knowledge about Mfd is based on data from biochemical studies. However, little is known about Mfds function in living cells, especially in the absence of exogenous DNA damage. Here, we show that Mfd modulates RNAP association and alters transcription at a variety of chromosomal loci, especially those containing highly structured, regulatory RNAs. As such, this work improves our understanding of Mfds function in living cells, and assigns it a new function as a transcription regulator.",

    "abstract": "Error-based and reward-based processes are critical for motor learning, and are thought to be mediated via distinct neural pathways. However, recent behavioral work in humans suggests that both learning processes are supported by cognitive strategies and that these contribute to individual differences in motor learning ability. While it has been speculated that medial temporal lobe regions may support this strategic component to learning, direct evidence is lacking. Here we first show that faster and more complete learning during error-based visuomotor adaptation is associated with better learning during reward-based shaping of reaching movements. This result suggests that strategic processes, linked to faster and better learning, drive individual differences in both error-based and reward-based motor learning. We then show that right entorhinal cortex volume was larger in good learning individuals--classified across both motor learning tasks--compared to their poorer learning counterparts. This suggests that strategic processes underlying both error- and reward-based learning are linked to neuroanatomical differences in entorhinal cortex.\n\nSignificance StatementWhile it is widely appreciated that humans vary greatly in their motor learning abilities, little is known about the processes and neuroanatomical bases that underlie these differences. Here, using a data-driven approach, we show that individual variability in error-based and reward-based motor learning is tightly linked, and related to the use of cognitive strategies. We further show that structural differences in entorhinal cortex predict this intersubject variability in motor learning, with larger entorhinal volumes being associated with better overall error-based and reward-based learning. Together, these findings provide support for the notion that the ability to recruit strategic processes underlies intersubject variability in both error-based and reward-based learning, which itself may be linked to structural differences in medial temporal regions.",

Higher-order learning mechanisms like second-order conditioning (SOC) may allow stimuli that were never experienced together with reinforcement to acquire motivational value. Despite its explanatory potential for real-world learning, surprisingly little is known about the neural mechanism underlying such associative transfer of value in SOC. Here, we used multivariate cross-session, cross-modality searchlight classification on functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from humans during SOC. We show that visual first-order conditioned stimuli (CS) reinstate cortical patterns representing previously paired gustatory outcomes in the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). During SOC, this OFC region showed increased functional covariation with amygdala, where neural pattern similarity between second-order CS and outcomes increased from early to late stages of SOC. Our data suggest a mechanism by which motivational value is conferred to stimuli that were never paired with reinforcement.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus has been extensively studied in various neuropsychiatric disorders throughout the lifespan. However, inconsistent results have been reported with respect to which subfield volumes are most related to age. Here, we investigate whether these discrepancies may be explained by experimental design differences that exist between studies. Multiple datasets were used to collect 1690 magnetic resonance scans from healthy individuals aged 18-95 years old. Standard T1-weighted (T1w; MPRAGE sequence, 1 mm3 voxels), high-resolution T2-weighted (T2w; SPACE sequence, 0.64 mm3 voxels) and slab T2-weighted (Slab; 2D turbo spin echo, 0.4 x 0.4 x 2 mm3 voxels) images were acquired. The MAGeT Brain algorithm was used for segmentation of the hippocampal grey matter (GM) subfields and peri-hippocampal white matter (WM) subregions. Linear mixed-effect models and Akaike information criterion were used to examine linear, second or third order natural splines relationship between hippocampal volumes and age. We demonstrated that stratum radiatum/lacunosum/moleculare and fornix subregions expressed the highest relative volumetric decrease, while the cornus ammonis 1 presented a relative volumetric preservation of its volume with age. We also found that volumes extracted from slab images were often underestimated and demonstrated different age-related relationships compared to volumes extracted from T1w and T2w images. The current work suggests that although T1w, T2w and slab derived subfield volumetric outputs are largely homologous, modality choice plays a meaningful role in the volumetric estimation of the hippocampal subfields.",

We administered a pre- and post-anesthetic battery of neurocognitive tests, recorded continuous electroencephalography to assess cortical dynamics, and monitored sleep-wake activity before and following anesthetic exposure. We hypothesized that cognitive reconstitution would be a process that evolved over time in the following sequence: attention, complex scanning and tracking, working memory, and executive function. Contrary to our hypothesis, executive function returned first and electroencephalographic analyses revealed that frontal cortical dynamics recovered faster than posterior cortical dynamics. Furthermore, actigraphy indicated normal sleep-wake patterns in the post-anesthetic period. These recovery patterns of higher cognitive function and arousal states suggest that the healthy human brain is resilient to the effects of deep general anesthesia.",

The clinical and epidemiologic utilities of antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 testing are under debate. Characterizing these assays helps to understand the disease and provides scientific basis for deciding how to best use these assays. The study assessed one chemiluminescent assay (Abbott COVID-2 IgG) and two lateral flow assays (STANDARD Q [SQ] IgM/IgG Duo and Wondfo Total Antibody Test). Validation included 113 blood samples from 71 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients and 1182 samples from negative controls with potential interferences/cross-reactions, including 1063 pre-pandemic samples. IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected as early as post-symptom onset days 3-4. IgG antibodies were first detected post-onset days 5-6 by SQ assays. The detection rates increased gradually, and SQ IgG, Abbott IgG and Wondfo Total detected antibodies from all the PCR-confirmed patients 14 days after symptom onset. Overall agreements between SQ IgM/IgG and Wondfo Total was 88.5% and between SQ IgG and Abbott IgG was 94.6% (Kappa = 0.75, 0.89). No cross-reaction with other endemic coronavirus infections were identified. Viral hepatitis and autoimmune samples were the main cross-reactions observed. However, the interferences/cross-reactions were low. The specificities were 100% for SQ IgG and Wondfo Total and 99.62% for Abbott IgG and 98.87% for SQ IgM. These findings demonstrate high sensitivity and specificity of appropriately validated antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 assays with implications for clinical use and epidemiological seroprevalence studies.View Full Text",

Finally, NICEdrug.ch suggests over 1,300 drugs and food molecules to target COVID-19 and explains their inhibitory mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most common type of chronic liver disease in developed nations, affecting around 25% of the population. Elucidating the factors causing NAFLD in individual patients to progress in different rates and to different degrees of severity, is a matter of active medical research. Here, we aim to provide evidence that the intra-hepatic heterogeneity of rheological, metabolic and tissue-regenerating capacities plays a central role in disease progression. We developed a generic mathematical model that constitutes the liver as ensemble of small liver units differing in their capacities to metabolize potentially cytotoxic free fatty acids (FFAs) and to repair FFA-induced cell damage. Transition from simple steatosis to more severe forms of NAFLD is described as self-amplifying process of cascading liver failure, which to stop depends essentially on the distribution of functional capacities across the liver. Model simulations provided the following insights: (1) A persistently high plasma level of FFAs is sufficient to drive the liver through different stages of NAFLD; (2) Presence of NAFLD amplifies the deleterious impact of additional tissue-damaging hits; and (3) Coexistence of non-steatotic and highly steatotic regions is indicative for the later occurrence of severe NAFLD stages.",

    "abstract": "Despite the epidemics of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this disease are far from being understood. Here, we characterize and classify the cellular composition within the alveolar space and peripheral blood of COPD patients and control donors using a clinically applicable single-cell RNA-seq technology corroborated by advanced computational approaches for: machine learning-based cell-type classification, identification of differentially expressed genes, prediction of metabolic changes, and modeling of cellular trajectories within a patient cohort. These high-resolution approaches revealed: massive transcriptional plasticity of macrophages in the alveolar space with increased levels of invading and proliferating cells, loss of MHC expression, reduced cellular motility, altered lipid metabolism, and a metabolic shift reminiscent of mitochondrial dysfunction in COPD patients. Collectively, single-cell omics of multi-tissue samples was used to build the first cellular and molecular framework for COPD pathophysiology as a prerequisite to develop molecular biomarkers and causal therapies against this deadly disease.",

    "abstract": "The use of cell factories to convert sugars from lignocellulosic biomass into chemicals in which oleochemicals and food additives, such as carotenoids, is essential for the shift towards sustainable processes. Rhodotorula toruloides is a yeast that naturally metabolises a wide range of substrates, including lignocellulosic hydrolysates, and converts them into lipids and carotenoids. In this study, xylose, the main component of hemicellulose, was used as the sole substrate for R. toruloides, and a detailed physiology characterisation combined with absolute proteomics and genome-scale metabolic models was carried out to understand the regulation of lipid and carotenoid production. To improve these productions, oxidative stress was induced by hydrogen peroxide and light irradiation and further enhanced by adaptive laboratory evolution. Based on the online measurements of growth and CO2 excretion, three distinct growth phases were identified during batch cultivations. The intracellular flux estimations correlated well with the measured protein levels and demonstrated improved NADPH regeneration, phosphoketolase activity and reduced beta-oxidation, correlating with increasing lipid yields. Light irradiation resulted in 70% higher carotenoid and 40% higher lipid yields. The presence of hydrogen peroxide did not affect the carotenoid yield but culminated in the highest lipid yield of 0.65 g/gDCW. The adapted strain showed improved fitness and 2.3-fold higher carotenoid yield than the parental strain. This work presented a holistic view of xylose conversion into microbial oil and carotenoids by R. toruloides for further cost-effective and renewable production of these molecules.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of diverse types of omics data on schizophrenia (SCZ) requires a systems approach to jointly modeling the interplay between genome, transcriptome and proteome. Proteome dynamics, as the definitive cellular machinery in human body, has been lagging behind the research on genome/transcriptome in the context of SCZ, both at tissue and single-cell resolution. We introduce a Markov Affinity-based Proteogenomic Signal Diffusion (MAPSD) method to model intra-cellular protein trafficking paradigms and tissue-wise single-cell protein abundances. MAPSD integrates multi-omics data to amplify the signals at SCZ risk loci with small effect sizes, and reveal convergent disease-associated gene modules in the brain interactome as well as more than 130 tissue/cell-type combinations. We predicted a set of high-confidence SCZ risk genes, the majority of which are not directly connected to SCZ susceptibility risk genes. We characterized the subcellular localization of proteins encoded by candidate SCZ risk genes in various brain regions, and illustrated that most are enriched in neuronal and Purkinje cells in cerebral cortex. We demonstrated how the identified gene set may be involved in different developmental stages of the brain, how they alter SCZ-related biological pathways, and how they can be effectively leveraged for drug repurposing. MAPSD can be applied to other polygenic diseases, yet our case study on SCZ signifies how tissue-adjusted protein-protein interaction networks can assist in generating deeper insights into the orchestration of polygenic diseases.",
