    "abstract": "As most species live in seasonal environments, considering varying conditions is essential to understand species dynamics in both geographic and ecological spaces. Both resident and migratory species need to contend with seasonality, and balance settling in favorable areas with tracking favorable environmental conditions during the year. We present an exploratory framework to jointly investigate a species niche in geographic and ecological spaces, applied to wood storks (Mycteria americana), which are partially migratory wading birds, in the southeastern U.S. We concurrently described monthly geographic distributions and climatic niches based on temperature and precipitation. Geographic distributions of wood storks were more similar throughout the year than were climatic niches, suggesting that birds stay within specific areas seasonally, rather than tracking areas of similar climate. However, wood storks expressed consistent selection of warm areas during the winter, and wet areas during the summer, indicating that the selection of seasonal ranges may be directly related to environmental conditions across the entire range. Our flexible framework, which simultaneously considered geographic and ecological spaces, suggested that tracking climate alone did not explain seasonal distributions of wood storks in breeding and non-breeding areas.",

    "abstract": "Cognition involves using attended information, maintained in working memory (WM), to guide action. During a cognitive task, a correct response requires flexible, selective gating so that only the appropriate information flows from WM to downstream effectors that carry out the response. In this work, we used biophysically-detailed modeling to explore the hypothesis that network oscillations in prefrontal cortex (PFC), leveraging local inhibition, can independently gate responses to items in WM. The key role of local inhibition was to control the period between spike bursts in the outputs, and to produce an oscillatory response no matter whether the WM item was maintained in an asynchronous or oscillatory state. We found that the WM item that induced an oscillatory population response in the PFC output layer with the shortest period between spike bursts was most reliably propagated. The network resonant frequency (i.e., the input frequency that produces the largest response) of the output layer can be flexibly tuned by varying the excitability of deep layer principal cells. Our model suggests that experimentally-observed modulation of PFC beta-frequency (15-30 Hz) and gamma-frequency (30-80 Hz) oscillations could leverage network resonance and local inhibition to govern the flexible routing of signals in service to cognitive processes like gating outputs from working memory and the selection of rule-based actions. Importantly, we show for the first time that nonspecific changes in deep layer excitability can tune the output gates resonant frequency, enabling the specific selection of signals encoded by populations in asynchronous or fast oscillatory states. More generally, this represents a dynamic mechanism by which adjusting network excitability can govern the propagation of asynchronous and oscillatory signals throughout neocortex.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-EM Single Particle Analysis workflows require from tens of thousands of high-quality particle projections to unveil the three-dimensional structure of macromolecules. Conventional methods for automatic particle picking tend to suffer from high false-positive rates, hurdling the reconstruction process. One common cause of this problem is the presence of carbon and different types of high-contrast contaminations. In order to overcome this limitation, we have developed MicrographCleaner, a deep learning package designed to discriminate which regions of micrographs are suitable for particle picking and which are not in an automatic fashion. MicrographCleaner implements a U-net-like deep learning model trained on a manually curated dataset compiled from over five hundred micrographs. The benchmarking, carried out on about one hundred independent micrographs, shows that MicrographCleaner is a very efficient approach for micrograph preprocessing. MicrographCleaner (micrograph_cleaner_em) package is available at PyPI and Anaconda Cloud and also as a Scipion/Xmipp protocol.

    "abstract": "Especially for the high-dimensional data collected in neuroscience, nonparametric statistical tests are an excellent alternative for parametric statistical tests. Because of the freedom to use any function of the data as a test statistic, nonparametric tests have the potential for a drastic increase in sensitivity by making a biologically-informed choice for a test statistic. In a companion paper (Geerligs & Maris, 2020), we demonstrate that such a drastic increase is actually possible. This increase in sensitivity is only useful if, at the same time, the false alarm (FA) rate can be controlled. However, for some study types (e.g., within-participant studies), nonparametric tests do not control the FA rate (see Eklund, Nichols, & Knutsson, 2016). In the present paper, we present a family of nonparametric randomization and permutation tests of which we prove exact FA rate control. Crucially, these proofs hold for a much larger family of study types than before, and they include both within-participant studies and studies in which the explanatory variable is not under experimental control. The crucial element of this statistical innovation is the adoption of a novel but highly relevant null hypothesis: statistical independence between the biological and the explanatory variable.",

A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-replicating viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_ST_ABSMotivationC_ST_ABSThe binding of small molecules to RNAs is an important mechanism which can stabilize 3D structures or activate key molecular functions. To date, computational and experimental efforts toward small molecule binding prediction have primarily focused on protein targets. Considering that a very large portion of the genome is transcribed into non-coding RNAs but only few regions are translated into proteins, successful annotations of RNA elements targeted by small-molecule would likely uncover a vast repertoire of biological pathways and possibly lead to new therapeutic avenues.\n\nResultsOur work is a first attempt at bringing machine learning approaches to the problem of RNA drug discovery. RNAmigos takes advantage of the unique structural properties of RNA to predict small molecule ligands for unseen binding sites. A key feature of our model is an efficient representation of binding sites as augmented base pairing networks (ABPNs) aimed at encoding important structural patterns. We subject our ligand predictions to two virtual screen settings and show that we are able to rank the known ligand on average in the 73rd percentile, showing a significant improvement over several baselines. Furthermore, we observe that graphs which are augmented with non-Watson Crick (a.k.a non-canonical) base pairs are the only representation which is able to retrieve a significant signal, suggesting that non-canonical interactions are an necessary source of binding specificity in RNAs. We also find that an auxiliary graph representation task significantly boosts performance by providing efficient structural embeddings to the low data setting of ligand prediction. RNAmigos shows that RNA binding data contains structural patterns with potential for drug discovery, and provides methodological insights which can be applied to other structure-function learning tasks.\n\nAvailabilityCode and data is freely available at http://csb.cs.mcgill.ca/RNAmigos.\n\nContactjerome@cs.mcgill.ca",

    "abstract": "Breathing air is a fundamental human need, yet its safety, when challenged by various harmful or lethal substances, is often not properly guarded. For example, air toxicity is currently monitored only for single or limited number of known toxicants, thus failing to fully warn against possible hazardous air. Here, we discovered that within minutes living rats emitted distinctive profiles of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) via breath when exposed to various airborne toxicants such as endotoxin, O3, ricin, and CO2. Compared to background indoor air, when exposed to ricin or endotoxin aerosols breath-borne VOC levels, especially that of carbon disulfide, were shown to decrease; while their elevated levels were observed for O3 and CO2 exposures. A clear contrast in breath-borne VOCs profiles of rats between different toxicant exposures was observed with a statistical significance. Differences in MicroRNA regulations such as miR-33, miR-146a and miR-155 from rats blood samples revealed different mechanisms used by the rats in combating different air toxicant challenges. Similar to dogs, rats were found here to be able to sniff against toxic air by releasing a specific breath-borne VOC profile. The discovered science opens a new arena for online monitoring air toxicity and health effects of pollutants.\n\nTOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/739003v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f419cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ca1582org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4a35ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@128b6f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Complex behaviors are often driven by an internal model, which integrates sensory information over time and facilitates long-term planning to reach subjective goals. We interpret behavioral data by assuming an agent behaves rationally -- that is, they take actions that optimize their subjective reward according to their understanding of the task and its relevant causal variables. We apply a new method, Inverse Rational Control (IRC), to learn an agents internal model and reward function by maximizing the likelihood of its measured sensory observations and actions. This thereby extracts rational and interpretable thoughts of the agent from its behavior. We also provide a framework for interpreting encoding, recoding and decoding of neural data in light of this rational model for behavior. When applied to behavioral and neural data from simulated agents performing suboptimally on a naturalistic foraging task, this method successfully recovers their internal model and reward function, as well as the computational dynamics within the neural manifold that represents the task. This work lays a foundation for discovering how the brain represents and computes with dynamic beliefs.",

Hotspots of turbidity within the lake were in particular highlighted. Moreover both submerged and riparian vegetation showed harmful impacts due to sediment deposition. A partial loss of submerged macrophyte cover was found, with delayed growth and a possible community shift in favor of species adapted to inorganic substrates. Satellite-derived seasonal dynamics showed that exceptional sediment load can overwrite climatic factors in controlling phenology of riparian reed beds, resulting in two consecutive years with shorter than normal growing season, and roughly 20% drop in productivity according to spectral proxies: compared to 2016, senescence came earlier by around 20 days on average in 2017 season, and green-up was delayed by up to 50 days (20 days, on average) in 2018, following the landslide.\n\nThe approach presented could be easily implemented for continuous monitoring of similar ecosystems subject to external pressures with periods of high sediment loads.",

    "abstract": "Despite the homogenising effect of strong gene flow between two populations, adaptation under symmetric divergent selection pressures results in partial reproductive isolation: adaptive substitutions act as local barriers to gene flow, and if divergent selection continues unimpeded, this will result in complete reproductive isolation of the two populations, i.e. speciation. However, a key issue in framing the process of speciation as a tension between local adaptation and the homogenising force of gene flow is that the mutation process is blind to changes in the environment and therefore tends to limit adaptation. Here we investigate how globally beneficial mutations (GBMs) affect divergent local adaptation and reproductive isolation. When phenotypic divergence is finite, we show that the presence of GBMs limits local adaptation, generating a persistent genetic load at the loci which contribute to the trait under divergent selection and reducing genome-wide divergence. Furthermore, we show that while GBMs cannot prohibit the process of continuous differentiation, they induce a substantial delay in the genome-wide shutdown of gene flow.",

    "abstract": "Dimethylformamidase (DMFase) breaks down the human-made synthetic solvent N,N-dimethyl formamide(DMF) used extensively in industry(1). DMF is not known to exist in nature and was first synthesized in 1893. In spite of the recent origin of DMF, certain bacterial species such as Paracoccus, Pseudomonas, and Alcaligenes have evolved pathways to breakdown DMF and use them as carbon and nitrogen source for growth(2, 3). The work presented here provides a molecular basis for the ability of DMFase from Paracoccus to function in exacting conditions of high solvent concentrations, temperature and ionic strength to catalyze the hydrolysis of a stable amide bond. The structure reveals a multimeric complex of the 2{beta}2 type or (2{beta}2)2 type. One of the three domains of the large subunit and the small subunit are hitherto undescribed folds and as yet of unknown evolutionary origin. The active site is made of a distinctive mononuclear iron that is coordinated by two tyrosine residues and a glutamic acid residue. The hydrolytic cleavage of the amide bond is catalyzed at the Fe3+ site with a proximal glutamate probably acting as the base. The change in the quaternary structure is salt dependent with high salt resulting in the larger oligomeric state. Kinetic characterization reveals an enzyme that shows cooperativity between subunits and the structure provides clues on the interconnection between the active sites.\n\nSignificance StatementN,N-dimethyl formamide(DMF) is a commonly used industrial solvent that was first synthesized in 1893. The properties that make DMF a highly desired solvent also makes it a difficult compound to breakdown. Yet, certain bacteria have evolved to survive in environments polluted by DMF and have enzymes that breakdown DMF and use it as their carbon and nitrogen source. The molecular structure of the enzyme that breaks down the stable amide bond in these bacteria, reveals two new protein folds and a unique mononuclear iron active site. The work reported here provides the structural and biochemical framework to query the evolutionary origins of the protein, as well as in engineering this enzyme for use in bioremediation of a human made toxic solvent.",

Autism affects males more frequently than females and sex-related mechanisms (e.g., X-linked genes, androgen hormones) can influence E:I balance. This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveChinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the leading cell factories for producing recombinant proteins in the biopharmaceutical industry. In this regard, constraint-based metabolic models are useful platforms to perform computational analysis of cell metabolism. These models need to be regularly updated in order to include the latest biochemical data of the cells, and to increase their predictive power. Here, we provide an update to iCHO1766, the metabolic model of CHO cells.\n\nResultsWe expanded the existing model of Chinese hamster metabolism with the help of four gap-filling approaches, leading to the addition of 773 new reactions and 335 new genes. We incorporated these into an updated genome-scale metabolic network model of CHO cells, named iCHO2101. In this updated model, the number of reactions and pathways capable of carrying flux is substantially increased.\n\nConclusionsThe present CHO model is an important step towards more complete metabolic models of CHO cells.",

    "abstract": "The release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from human multipotent stromal cells (MSC) has been proposed as a mechanism by which MSC mediate regenerative functions in vivo. Our recent work has characterized MSC derived from human pancreatic tissues (Panc-MSC) that generated a tissue regenerative secretome. Despite these advancements, it remains unknown whether regenerative stimuli are released independent or within extracellular vesicles. Herein, this study demonstrates ultrafiltration is a simple method to enrich for EVs which can be injected in murine models of tissue regeneration. The enrichment of EVs from Panc-MSC conditioned media (CM) was validated using nanoscale flow cytometry and atomic force microscopy; in addition to the exclusive detection of classical EV-markers CD9, CD81, CD63 using label-free mass spectrometry. Additionally, we identified several pro-regenerative stimuli, such as WNT5A or ANGPT1, exclusive to EV-enriched CM. Endothelial cell tubule formation was enhanced in response to both Panc-MSC CM fractions in vitro yet only intramuscular injection of EV-enriched CM demonstrated vascular regenerative functions in NOD/SCID mice with unilateral hind-limb ischemia (*<p<0.05). Furthermore, both EV-depleted and EV-enriched CM reduced hyperglycemia following intrapancreatic injection in hyperglycemic mice (**p<0.01). Collectively, understanding the functional synergy between compartments of the secretome is required to advance cell-free biotherapeutics into applications of regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Acute inflammation is a protective reaction by the immune system in response to invading pathogens or tissue damage. Ideally, the response should be localized, self-limited, and returning to homeostasis. If not resolved, acute inflammation can result in organ pathologies leading to chronic inflammatory phenotypes. Acute inflammation and inflammation resolution are complex coordinated processes, involving a number of cell types, interacting in space and time. The biomolecular complexity and the fact that several biomedical fields are involved, make a multi and interdisciplinary approach necessary.\n\nThis Atlas of Inflammation Resolution (AIR) is a web-based resource capturing the state-of-the-art in acute inflammation and inflammation resolution research. The AIR provides an interface for users to search thousands of interactions, arranged in inter-connected multi-layers of process diagrams, covering a wide range of clinically relevant phenotypes. The AIR serves as an open access knowledgebase, including a gateway to numerous public databases. It is furthermore possible for the user to map experimental data onto the molecular interaction maps of the AIR, providing the basis for bioinformatics analyses and systems biology approaches. By mapping experimental data onto the Atlas, it can be used to elucidate drug action as well as molecular mechanisms underlying different disease phenotypes. For the visualization and exploration of information, the AIR uses the Minerva platform, which is a well-established tool for the presentation of disease maps. The molecular details of the AIR are encoded using international standards.\n\nThe Atlas of Inflammation Resolution was created as a freely accessible resource, supporting research and education in the fields of acute inflammation and inflammation resolution. The AIR connects research communities, facilitates clinical decision making, and supports research scientists in the formulation and validation of hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "Viruses evolve extremely quickly, so reliable methods for viral host prediction are necessary to safeguard biosecurity and biosafety alike. Novel human-infecting viruses are difficult to detect with standard bioinformatics workflows. Here, we predict whether a virus can infect humans directly from next-generation sequencing reads. We show that deep neural architectures significantly outperform both shallow machine learning and standard, homology-based algorithms, cutting the error rates in half and generalizing to taxonomic units distant from those presented during training. Further, we develop a suite of interpretability tools and show that it can be applied also to other models beyond the host prediction task. We propose a new approach for convolutional filter visualization to disentangle the information content of each nucleotide from its contribution to the final classification decision. Nucleotide-resolution maps of the learned associations between pathogen genomes and the infectious phenotype can be used to detect regions of interest in novel agents, for example the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, unknown before it caused a COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication (WGD) occurs across kingdoms and can promote adaptation. However, a sudden increase in chromosome number, as well as changes in physiology, are traumatic to conserved processes. Previous work in Arabidopsis arenosa revealed a coordinated genomic response to WGD, involving physically interacting meiosis proteins, as well as changes related to cell cycle and ion homeostasis. Here we ask: is this coordinated shift in the same processes repeated in another species following WGD? To answer this, we resequenced and cytologically assessed replicated populations from a diploid/autotetraploid system, Cardamine amara, and test the hypothesis that gene and process-level convergence will be prevalent between these two WGDs adaptation events. Interestingly, we find that gene-level convergence is negligible, with no more in common than would be expected by chance. This was most clear at meiosis-related genes, consistent with our cytological assessment of somewhat lower meiotic stability in C. amara, despite establishment and broad occurrence of the autotetraploid in nature. In contrast, obvious convergence at the level of functional processes, including meiotic cell cycle, chromosome organisation and stress signalling was evident. This indicates that the two autotetraploids survived challenges attendant to WGD via contrasting solutions, modifying different players from similar processes. Overall, this work gives the first insight into the salient adaptations required to cope with a genome-doubled state and brings the first genomic evidence that autopolyploids can utilize multiple trajectories to achieve adaptation to WGD. We speculate that this flexibility increases the likelihood a nascent polyploid overcomes early stringent challenges to later access the spectrum of evolutionary opportunities of polyploidy.\n\nSignificance statementWhole genome duplication (WGD) is a tremendous mutation and an important evolutionary force. It also presents immediate changes to meiosis and cell physiology that nascent polyploids must overcome to survive. Given the dual facts that WGD adaptation is difficult, but many lineages nevertheless survive WGD, we ask: how constrained are the evolutionary responses to a genome-doubled state? We previously identified candidate genes for WGD adaptation in Arabidopsis arenosa, which has natural diploid and tetraploid variants. Here we test for evolutionary convergence in adaptation to WGD in a species 17 million years distant, Cardamine amara. This work gives the first genomic insight into of how autopolyploids utilize multiple adaptive trajectories to manage a genome-doubled state.",

    "abstract": "Individuals of the same chronological age display different rates of biological ageing. A number of measures of biological age have been proposed which harness age-related changes in DNA methylation profiles. These include methylation-based predictors of chronological age (HorvathAge, HannumAge), all-cause mortality (DNAm PhenoAge, DNAm GrimAge) and telomere length (DNAm Telomere Length). In this study, we test the association between these epigenetic markers of ageing and the prevalence and incidence of the leading causes of disease burden and mortality in high-income countries. Furthermore, we test the clocks relationships with phenotypic measures associated with these conditions, including spirometric and biochemical traits. We carry out these analyses in 9,537 individuals from the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study. We find that DNAm GrimAge outperforms other epigenetic clocks in its associations with self-report disease prevalence and related clinical traits. DNAm GrimAge associates with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prevalence (Odds Ratio = 3.29, P = 3.0 x 10-4) and pulmonary spirometry tests ({beta} = [-0.10 to -0.15], P = [1.4 x 10-4 to 1.4 x 10-6]) at study baseline after adjusting for possibly confounding risk factors including alcohol, body mass index, deprivation, education and smoking. After adjusting for these confounding risk factors, DNAm GrimAge, DNAm PhenoAge and DNAm Telomere Length, measured at study baseline, predict incidence of ICD-10-coded disease states including COPD, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease after thirteen years of follow-up (Hazard Ratios = [0.80 (telomere length) to 2.19 (GrimAge)], P = [9.9 x 10-4, 1.9 x 10-14]). Our data show that despite accounting for several possible confounding variables, epigenetic markers of ageing predict incidence of common disease. This may have significant implications for their potential utility in clinical settings to complement gold-standard methods of clinical assessment and management.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has demonstrated its predictive power in modeling complex biological phenomena such as gene expression. The value of these models hinges not only on their accuracy, but also on the ability to extract biologically relevant information from the trained models. While there has been much recent work on developing feature attribution methods that discover the most important features for a given sequence, inferring cooperativity between regulatory elements, which is the hallmark of phenomena such as gene expression, remains an open problem. We present SATORI, a Self-ATtentiOn based model to detect Regulatory element Interactions. Our approach combines convolutional layers with a self-attention mechanism that helps us capture a global view of the landscape of interactions between regulatory elements in a sequence. A comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the ability of SATORI to identify numerous statistically significant TF-TF interactions, many of which have been previously reported. Our method is able to detect higher numbers of experimentally verified TF-TF interactions than existing methods, and has the advantage of not requiring a computationally expensive post-processing step. Finally, SATORI can be used for detection of any type of feature interaction in models that use a similar attention mechanism, and is not limited to the detection of TF-TF interactions.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces a hierarchical model to estimate haplotype effects based on phylogenetic relationships between haplotypes and their association with observed phenotypes. In a population there are usually many, but not all possible, distinct haplotypes and few observations per haplotype. Further, haplotype frequencies tend to vary substantially - few haplotypes have high frequency and many haplotypes have low frequency. Such data structure challenge estimation of haplotype effects. However, haplotypes often differ only due to few mutations and leveraging these similarities can improve the estimation of haplotype effects. There is extensive literature on this topic. Here we build on these observations and develop an autoregressive model of order one that hierarchically models haplotype effects by leveraging phylogenetic relationships between the haplotypes described with a directed acyclic graph. The phylogenetic relationships can be either in a form of a tree or a network and we therefore refer to the model as the haplotype network model. The haplotype network model can be included as a component in a phenotype model to estimate associations between haplotypes and phenotypes. The key contribution of this work is that by leveraging the haplotype network structure we obtain a sparse model and by using hierarchical autoregression the flow of information between similar haplotypes is estimated from the data. We show with a simulation study that the hierarchical model can improve estimates of haplotype effects compared to an independent haplotype model, especially when there are few observations for a specific haplotype. We also compared it to a mutation model and observed comparable performance, though the haplotype model has the potential to capture background specific effects. We demonstrate the model with a case study of modeling the effect of mitochondrial haplotypes on milk yield in cattle.",

It allows to statistically test for the presence or absence of sex chromosomes, and to infer sex-linked genes based on the posterior probabilities in the model. Furthermore, for gametologous sequences, the haplotype and level of nucleotide polymorphism of each copy can be inferred, as well as the divergence between both. We test the method using simulated and human sequencing data, and show that, for most cases, robust predictions are obtained with 5 to 10 individuals per sex.",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial binding of transcription factors to regulatory DNA underpins gene regulation in all organisms. Genetic variation in regulatory regions has been connected with diseases and diverse phenotypic traits1, yet it remains challenging to distinguish variants that impact regulatory function2. Genomic DNase I footprinting enables quantitative, nucleotide-resolution delineation of sites of transcription factor occupancy within native chromatin3-5. However, to date only a small fraction of such sites have been precisely resolved on the human genome sequence5. To enable comprehensive mapping of transcription factor footprints, we produced high-density DNase I cleavage maps from 243 human cell and tissue types and states and integrated these data to delineate at nucleotide resolution ~4.5 million compact genomic elements encoding transcription factor occupancy. We map the fine-scale structure of ~1.6 million DHS and show that the overwhelming majority is populated by well-spaced sites of single transcription factor:DNA interaction. Cell context-dependent cis-regulation is chiefly executed by wholesale actuation of accessibility at regulatory DNA versus by differential transcription factor occupancy within accessible elements. We show further that the well-described enrichment of disease- and phenotypic trait-associated genetic variants in regulatory regions1,6 is almost entirely attributable to variants localizing within footprints, and that functional variants impacting transcription factor occupancy are nearly evenly partitioned between loss- and gain-of-function alleles. Unexpectedly, we find that the global density of human genetic variation is markedly increased within transcription factor footprints, revealing an unappreciated driver of cis-regulatory evolution. Our results provide a new framework for both global and nucleotide-precision analyses of gene regulatory mechanisms and functional genetic variation.",

Moreover, recent evidence shows increasing functional over-redundancy towards the tropics, suggesting that the extent to which functional traits confer species fitness and thus impact community structuring differs across latitudes. Here, we develop a new method: comparing the frequencies of trait categories in the species-rank abundance distributions of local communities versus their frequencies in the regional average species pool. We contrasted subarctic versus subtropical copepod communities for six important traits. In subarctic communities, medium-sized and cold-water species are selected to dominate, thus traits affect relative fitness as predicted by classic niche theory. In subtropical communities, most species are small and warm-water, but these categories are not selected to dominate, suggesting that greater diversity towards the tropics results from lesser trait-based fitness differences allowing more species to coexist.",

    "abstract": "AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSEcological diversity in fungi is largely defined by metabolic traits, including the ability to produce secondary or \"specialized\" metabolites (SMs) that mediate interactions with other organisms. Fungal SM pathways are frequently encoded in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), which facilitate the identification and characterization of metabolic pathways. Variation in BGC composition reflects the diversity of their SM products. Recent studies have documented surprising diversity of BGC repertoires among isolates of the same fungal species, yet little is known about how this population-level variation is inherited across macroevolutionary timescales.\n\nResultsHere, we applied a novel linkage-based algorithm to reveal previously unexplored dimensions of diversity in BGC composition, distribution, and repertoire across 101 species of Dothideomycetes, which are considered to be the most phylogenetically diverse class of fungi and are known to produce many SMs. We predicted both complementary and overlapping sets of clustered genes compared with existing methods and identified novel gene pairs that associate with known secondary metabolite genes. We found that variation in BGC repertoires is due to non-overlapping BGC combinations and that several BGCs have biased ecological distributions, consistent with niche-specific selection. We observed that total BGC diversity scales linearly with increasing repertoire size, suggesting that secondary metabolites have little structural redundancy in individual fungi.\n\nConclusionsWe project that there is substantial unsampled BGC diversity across specific families of Dothideomycetes, which will provide a roadmap for future sampling efforts. Our approach and findings lend new insight into how BGC diversity is generated and maintained across an entire fungal taxonomic class.",

The toxicity of the DPRs has been shown to depend on their length, but the underlying molecular mechanism of this length dependence is not well understood. To address this, a one-bead-per-amino-acid (1BPA) coarse-grained molecular dynamics model is used to study the single-molecule and phase separation properties of the DPRs. We find a strong dependence of the phase separation behavior on both DPR length and concentration, with longer DPRs having a higher propensity to phase separate and form condensed phases with higher concentrations. The critical lengths required for phase separation (25 for poly-PR and 50 for poly-GA) are comparable to the toxicity threshold limit of 30 repeats found for the expansion mutation in patient cells, suggesting that phase separation could play an important role in DPR toxicity.",

    "abstract": "We used whole exome sequencing (WES) to determine the genetic etiology of a patient with a multi-system disorder characterized by a seizure phenotype. WES identified a heterozygous de novo missense mutation in the GABRA1 gene (c.875C>T). GABRA1 encodes the alpha subunit of the Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid receptor A (GABAAR). The GABAAR is a ligand gated ion channel that mediates the fast inhibitory signals of the nervous system and mutations in the sub-units that compose the GABAAR have been previously associated with human disease. To understand the mechanisms by which GABRA1 regulates brain development, we developed a zebrafish model of gabra1 deficiency. gabra1 expression is restricted to the nervous system and behavioral analysis of morpholino injected larvae suggests that the knockdown of gabra1 results in hypoactivity and defects in the expression of other sub-units of the GABAAR. Expression the human GABRA1 protein in morphants partially restored the hypomotility phenotype. In contrast, the expression of the c.875C>T variant did not restore these behavioral deficits. Collectively, these results represent a functional approach to understand the mechanisms by which loss of function alleles cause disease.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic bidirectional transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is critical for the regulation of many transcription factors, whose levels inside the nucleus must be tightly controlled. Efficient shuttling across the nuclear membrane is especially crucial with regard to the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, where the transcriptional signal depends on the fine balance between the amounts of Gli protein activator and repressor forms in the nucleus. The nuclear export machinery prevents the unchecked nuclear accumulation of Gli proteins, but the mechanistic insight into this process is limited. We show that the atypical exportin Xpo7 functions as a major nuclear export receptor that actively excludes Gli2 from the nucleus and controls the outcome of Hh signaling. We show that Xpo7 interacts with several domains of Gli2 and that this interaction is dependent on SuFu, a key negative regulator of Hh signaling. Our data pave the way for a more complete understanding of the nuclear shuttling of Gli proteins and the regulation of their transcriptional activity.",

We hypothesize that dosage compensation of critical genes could arise from systems-level properties of complex networks of microRNAs (miRNA) and transcription factors (TF) as a way for cancer cells to withstand the negative effects of aneuploidy. We studied gene dosage compensation at the transcriptional level on data of the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel with the aid of computational models to identify candidate genes with low tolerance to variation in gene expression despite high variation in copy numbers. We identified a network of TF and miRNAs validated interactions with those genes to construct a mathematical model where the property of dosage compensation emerged for MYC and STAT3. Compensation was mediated by feedback and feed-forward motifs with 4 miRNAs and was dependent on the kinetic parameters of these TF-miRNA interactions, indicating that network analysis was not enough to identify this emergent property. The inhibition of miRNAs compensating MYC suggest a therapeutic potential of targeting gene dosage compensation against aneuploid cancer.",

We show that Osh6 localization to contact sites depends on its interaction with the cytosolic tail of the ER-PM tether Ist2, a homologue of TMEM16 proteins. We identify a motif in the Ist2 tail, conserved in yeasts, as the Osh6-binding region, and we map an Ist2-binding surface on Osh6. Mutations in the Ist2 tail phenocopy osh6{Delta} osh7{Delta} deletion: they decrease cellular PS levels, and block PS transport to the PM.

Here, we show that the mitochondria proteome is enriched for proteins smaller than 100 a.a. (defined as SEPs). Using a mitochondrial prediction and validation pipeline for small open-reading-frame (sORF)-encoded peptides (SEPs), we report the discovery of 16 endogenous mitochondrial SEPs (mito-SEPs) associated with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Through functional prediction, proteomics, metabolomics and metabolic flux modeling, we demonstrate that BRAWNIN (BR), a 71 amino acid peptide encoded by the C12orf73 gene, is essential for respiratory chain complex III (CIII) assembly. In human cells, BR is induced by the energy-sensing AMPK pathway, and its depletion impairs mitochondrial ATP production. In vivo, BR is enriched in muscle tissues and its maternal zygotic deletion in zebrafish causes complete CIII loss, resulting in severe growth retardation, lactic acidosis and early death. Our findings demonstrate that BR is essential for oxidative phosphorylation across vertebrate species. We propose that mito-SEPs are an untapped resource for essential regulators of oxidative metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whopping cough, produces an adenylate cyclase toxin (CyaA) that plays a key role in the host colonization by targeting innate immune cells which express CD11b/CD18, the cellular receptor of CyaA. CyaA is also able to invade non-phagocytic cells, via a unique entry pathway consisting in a direct translocation of its catalytic domain across the cytoplasmic membrane of the cells. Within the cells, CyaA is activated by calmodulin to produce high levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and alter cellular physiology. In this study, we explored the effects of CyaA toxin on the cellular and molecular structure remodeling of A549 alveolar epithelial cells. Using classical imaging techniques, biochemical and functional tests, as well as advanced cell mechanics method, we quantify the structural and functional consequences of the massive increase of intracellular cyclic AMP induced by the toxin: cell shape rounding associated to adhesion weakening process, actin structure remodeling for the cortical and dense components, increase in cytoskeleton stiffness, and inhibition of migration and repair. We also show that, at the low concentrations that may be found in vivo during B. pertussis infection, CyaA impairs the migration and wound healing capacities of the intoxicated alveolar epithelial cells. Our results suggest that the CyaA, beyond its major role in disabling innate immune cells, might also contribute to the local alteration of the epithelial barrier of the respiratory tract, that is an hallmark of pertussis.",

    "abstract": "Cellular translation is essential to all life on earth and in recent years we have reported on the discovery of a unique dual translation system in zebrafish. In this system, a maternal-type variant shows absolute expression in eggs and is progressively replaced during embryogenesis by a somatic-type variant. There are several translation system components, all with a non-coding RNA part, that show this dual characteristic: snRNA, snoRNA, rRNA, RNaseP, tRNA, and SRP-RNA.\n\nTo produce sufficient ribosomes during oogenesis, zebrafish amplify their 45S locus (18S-5.8S-28S tandem repeat) by means of extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) organized in extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs). Although this cellular process is discovered quite some time ago, still little is known about the mechanisms involved. Yet, because only the 45S maternal-type (45S-M) rRNA is expressed during oogenesis, the zebrafish genome provides a rare opportunity to compare an ERC 45S locus to a non-ERC 45S locus.\n\nIn this study, we analyzed the genomic composition of the 45S-M and 45S-S (somatic-type) loci in combination with ultra-long read Nanopore sequencing of ERCs present in total DNA isolated from zebrafish eggs.\n\nWe discovered 45S-M flanking sequences that were absent in the 45S-S locus and showed high homology to immunoglobulin (Ig) switch regions. Also, several other unique G-quadruplex DNA containing regions were found in the 45S-M locus. Some of those auxiliary regions showed different sizes in the sequenced ERCs, although within each ERC they appear to have identical sizes. These results point to a two-step system for ERC synthesis in zebrafish oogenesis: first the 45S-M repeat is excised from the chromosome into an ERC by recombination that uses the flanking Ig switch-like regions, after which the initial ECR is multiplied and extended into many ECRs with a varying number of 45S-M repeats.",

Here, we present a formal framework and a web-based tool, the SensorOverlord, that predicts the input range of two-state ratiometric biosensors given the experimental error in measuring their signal. We demonstrate the utility of this tool by predicting the range of values that can be measured accurately by biosensors that detect pH, NAD+, NADH, NADPH, histidine, and glutathione redox potential. The SensorOverlord enables users to compare the predicted accuracy of biochemical measurements made with different biosensors, and subsequently select biosensors that are best suited for their experimental needs.",

    "abstract": "Proliferating cells must synthesize a wide variety of macromolecules while progressing through the cell cycle, but the coordination between cell cycle progression and cellular metabolism is still poorly understood. To identify metabolic processes that oscillate over the cell cycle, we performed comprehensive, non-targeted liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) based metabolomics of HeLa cells isolated in the G1 and SG2M cell cycle phases, capturing thousands of diverse metabolite ions. When accounting for increased total metabolite abundance due to cell growth throughout the cell cycle, 18% of the observed LC-HRMS peaks were at least 2-fold different between the stages, consistent with broad metabolic remodeling throughout the cell cycle. While most amino acids, phospholipids, and total ribonucleotides were constant across cell cycle phases, consistent with the view that total macromolecule synthesis does not vary across the cell cycle, certain metabolites were oscillating. For example, ribonucleotides were highly phosphorylated in SG2M, indicating an increase in energy charge, and several phosphatidylinositols were more abundant in G1, possibly indicating altered membrane lipid signaling. Within carbohydrate metabolism, pentose phosphates and methylglyoxal metabolites were associated with the cycle. Interestingly, hundreds of yet uncharacterized metabolites similarly oscillated between cell cycle phases, suggesting previously unknown metabolic activities that may be synchronized with cell cycle progression, providing an important resource for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Background: Prior research suggests that the amount of experience an individual has with an action influences the degree to which the sensorimotor systems of their brain are involved in the subsequent perception of those actions. Less is known about how action experience and conceptual understanding impact sensorimotor involvement during imitation. We sought to explore this question by comparing a group of sign language users to a group of non-signers. We pitted the following two hypotheses against each other: 1) Deaf signers will show increased sensorimotor activity during sign imitation, and greater differentiation between sign types, due to greater prior experience and conceptual understanding of the signs; versus 2): Deaf signers will show less sensorimotor system activity and less differentiation of sign types in the sensorimotor system, because for those individuals sign imitation involves language systems of the brain more robustly than sensorimotor systems. We collected electroencephalograms (EEG) while the two groups imitated videos showing one-handed and two-handed ASL signs. Time-frequency data analysis was performed on alpha- and beta-range oscillations while they watched signs with the intent to imitate, and imitated the signs. During observation, deaf signers showed early differentiation in alpha/beta power between the one- and two-handed sign conditions, whereas hearing non-signers did not discriminate between the sign categories this way. Significant differences between groups were seen during sign imitation, wherein deaf signers showed desynchronization of alpha/beta EEG signals, and hearing non-signers showed increased power. The study suggests that in an imitative context, deaf signers engage anticipatory motor preparation in advance of action production, while hearing non-signers engage slower, more memory-related processes to help them complete with the complex task.",

    "abstract": "Connectomics has demonstrated that synaptic networks and their topologies are precise and directly correlate with physiology and behavior. The next extension of connectomics is pathoconnectomics: to map neural network synaptology and circuit topologies corrupted by neurological disease in order to identify robust targets for therapeutics. In this report, we characterize the first pathoconnectome, in this case, generated from a retina with photoreceptor degeneration. We observe aberrant connectivity in the rod-network pathway and novel synaptic connections deriving from neurite sprouting. These observations reveal principles of neuron responses to the loss of network components and can be extended to other neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "Studies of cortical function-recovery require a comparison between normal and post-stroke conditions that lead to changes in cortical metaplasticity. Focal cortical stroke impairs experience-dependent plasticity (ExDP) in the neighboring somatosensory cortex and usually evokes periinfarct depolarizations (PiDs) - a spreading depression-like waves. Experimentally induced spreading depressions (SDs) affect gene expression and some of these changes persist for at least 30 days. However, such changes are not stroke-specific: migraine patients had prolonged protein changes after a single SD episode during migraine aura. This study investigates whether non-stroke depolarizations impair cortical ExDP similarly to the stroke.\n\nExDP was induced in rates with SDs or PiDs by a month of contralateral partial whiskers deprivation. Cortical activity was mapped by [14C]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) incorporation during stimulation of spared and contralateral homotopic whiskers. We found that whiskers deprivation after SDs resulted in normal cortical representation enlargement suggesting that SDs and PiDs depolarization have no influence on ExDP cortical map reorganization. PiDs and the MMP-9, -3, -2 or COX-2 proteins which are assumed to influence metaplasticity in rats after stroke were compared between the SDs induced by high osmolarity KCl solution and the PiDs following cortical photothrombotic stroke (PtS). We found that none of these factors directly caused cortical post-stroke metaplasticity changes. The only significant difference between stoke and induced SD was a greater imbalance in interhemispheric activity equilibrium after stroke. The interhemispheric interactions modified by stroke may therefore be a promising target for future studies of post-stroke ExDP and for convalescence studies.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPost-stroke metaplasticity changes in an injured hemisphere are not a consequence of spreading depolarizations\nC_LIO_LINone of the monitored proteins (MMP-2, -3, -9; COX-2) cause modifications in poststroke cortical plasticity\nC_LIO_LISpreading depressions have a prolonged, global influence on the functioning of both hemispheres and of the thalamus\nC_LIO_LIImpaired interhemispheric interactions may underlie the post-stroke metaplasticity changes in the injured hemisphere\nC_LI",
