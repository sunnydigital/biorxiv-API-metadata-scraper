    "abstract": "Naive CD8+ T cell activation results in an autonomous program of cellular proliferation and differentiation. However, the mechanisms that underpin this process are unclear. Here we profiled genome-wide changes in chromatin accessibility, gene transcription and the deposition of a key chromatin modification (H3K27me3) early after naive CD8+ T cell activation. Rapid upregulation of the histone demethylase, KDM6B, prior to first cell division was required for initiating H3K27me3 removal at genes essential for subsequent T cell differentiation and proliferation. Inhibition of KDM6B-dependent H3K27me3 demethylation limited the magnitude of an effective primary virus-specific CD8+ T cell response and the formation of memory CD8+ T cell populations. Accordingly, we define the early spatio-temporal events underpinning early lineage-specific epigenetic reprogramming that is necessary for autonomous CD8+ T cell proliferation and differentiation.",

Neural representations in the hippocampal, entorhinal and head direction (HD) networks during spatial navigation have been clearly documented, while the representational properties of the Subicular Complex (SC) network is rather unexplored, even though it has extensive anatomical connections with various brain regions involved in spatial information processing. Here, we report a global cue controlled highly coherent representation of the cue-conflict environment in the SC network, along with strong coupling between HD cells and Spatial cells. We propose that the attractor dynamics in the SC network might play a critical role in orientation of the spatial representations, thus providing a \"reference map\" of the environment for further processing at other networks.",

Specifically, we investigated the association between a papers posting time to bioR{chi}iv, a preprints server, and journal articles peer-review and acceptance time for PLOS ONE. So far, of the total papers published in 1,626 academic journals, the average publication rate of those posted in bioR{chi}iv is 40.67%. Meanwhile, PLOS ONE was the journal that published more papers. Analysis of peer-review and acceptance time of papers published in journals via preprints showed the time these papers are posted in relation to these intervals. The median of the peer-review and acceptance time of the journal submission date that was later than the date of first posting to bioR{chi}iv was 110.00 days, and in the reverse case, it was 139.50 days. Posting to the preprint server before journal submission shows a better order than vice versa. This study provides us a good understanding of the peer-review process. It also gives us good insights into optimizing this process, which would then facilitate paper publication and knowledge dissemination.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRNAs perform many functions in addition to supplying coding templates, such as binding proteins. RNA-protein interactions are important in multiple processes in all domains of life, and the discovery of additional protein-binding RNAs expands the scope for studying such interactions. To find such RNAs, we exploited a form of ribosomal regulation. Ribosome biosynthesis must be tightly regulated to ensure that concentrations of rRNAs and ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) match. One regulatory mechanism is a ribosomal leader (r-leader), which is a domain in the 5' UTR of an mRNA whose genes encode r-proteins. When the concentration of one of these r-proteins is high, the protein binds the r-leader in its own mRNA, reducing gene expression and thus protein concentrations. To date, 35 types of r-leaders have been validated or predicted.\n\nResultsBy analyzing additional conserved RNA structures on a multi-genome scale, we identified 20 novel r-leader structures. Surprisingly, these included new r-leaders in the highly studied organisms Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Our results reveal several cases where multiple unrelated RNA structures likely bind the same r-protein ligand, and uncover previously unknown r-protein ligands. Each r-leader consistently occurs upstream of r-protein genes, suggesting a regulatory function. That the predicted r-leaders function as RNAs is supported by evolutionary correlations in the nucleotide sequences that are characteristic of a conserved RNA secondary structure. The r-leader predictions are also consistent with the locations of experimentally determined transcription start sites.\n\nConclusionsThis work increases the number of known or predicted r-leader structures by more than 50%, providing additional opportunities to study structural and evolutionary aspects of RNA-protein interactions. These results provide a starting point for detailed experimental studies.",

    "abstract": "Yellow fever virus (YFV) is an RNA virus primarily targeting the liver. Severe YF cases are responsible for hemorrhagic fever, plausibly precipitated by excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs), such as the cytoplasmic RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and the viral RNA sensor PKR are known to initiate a pro-inflammatory response upon recognition of viral genomes. Here, we sought to reveal the main determinants responsible for the acute cytokine expression occurring in human hepatocytes following YFV infection. Using a RIG-I-defective human hepatoma cell line, we found that RIG-I largely contributes to cytokine secretion upon YFV infection. In infected RIG-I-proficient hepatoma cells, RIG-I was localized in stress granules. These granules are large aggregates of stalled translation preinitiation complexes known to concentrate RLRs and PKR, and are so far recognized as hubs orchestrating RNA virus sensing. Using PKR-deficient hepatoma cells, we found that PKR contributes to both stress granule formation and cytokine induction upon YFV infection. However, stress granules disruption did not affect the cytokine response to YFV infection, as assessed by siRNA-knockdown-mediated inhibition of stress granule assembly. Finally, no viral RNA was detected in stress granules using a fluorescence in situ hybridization approach coupled with immunofluorescence. Our findings suggest that both RIG-I and PKR mediate pro-inflammatory cytokine induction in YFV-infected hepatocytes, in a stress granule-independent manner. Therefore, by showing the uncoupling of the early cytokine response from the stress granules formation, our model challenges the current view by which stress granules are required for the mounting of the acute antiviral response.\n\nImportanceYellow fever is a mosquito-borne acute hemorrhagic disease caused by yellow fever virus (YFV). The mechanisms responsible for its pathogenesis remain largely unknown, although increased inflammation has been linked to worsened outcome. YFV targets the liver, where it primarily infects hepatocytes. We found that two RNA-sensing proteins, RIG-I and PKR, participate in the induction of pro-inflammatory mediators in human hepatocytes infected with YFV. We show that YFV infection promotes the formation of cytoplasmic structures, termed stress granules, in a PKR-, but not RIG-I-dependent manner. Whilst stress granules were previously postulated to be essential platforms for immune activation, we found that they are not required for pro-inflammatory mediators production upon YFV infection. Collectively, our work uncovered molecular events triggered by the replication of YFV, which could prove instrumental in clarifying the pathogenesis of the disease, with possible repercussions on disease management.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of criticism in everyday social situations, and its empirically demonstrated association with psychopathology, highlight the importance of understanding neural mechanisms underlying the perception and response of individuals to criticism. However, neuroimaging studies to date have been limited largely to maternal criticism. The present study aims to investigate neural responses to criticism originating from three different relationship types: romantic partners, friends, and parents. Perceived criticism ratings for these relationships from 49 participants were collected. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy was used to measure changes in oxygenated haemoglobin levels in the prefrontal cortex when participants read vignettes describing three different scenarios of criticism. Participants were randomly assigned to 3 groups where the given description of the relationship of the protagonist to the source of criticism for each vignette was randomised. A significant interaction between relationship type and perceived criticism ratings for mothers was found in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Compared to low perceived criticism, high perceived criticism individuals showed increased activation reading vignettes describing criticism from romantic partners and parents but decreased activation for those from friends. Findings contribute to understanding neural responses to criticism as observed from a third-party perspective. Future studies can look into differentiating neural responses of personalised experiences of criticism and third-party observations.",

    "abstract": "In order to evaluate the inhibitory effects of drug on the growth of babesia parasite, relative quantification real-time PCR method was developed in this study. The 18S rRNA gene was used as target gene for the 2-{Delta}{Delta}Ct method analysis. Meanwhile, Chicken RNA was added into the parasitized blood for total RNA extraction. The {beta}-actin gene of chicken was selected as internal control gene for the 2-{Delta}{Delta}Ct method analysis. Parasitized blood 100 L, 50 L, 25L, 12.5 L, 6.25 L was prepared for B. gibsoni relative quantification. Regression analysis results revealed that significant linear relationships between the relative quantification value and parasitemia. The 18S rRNA gene expression was significantly decreased after the treatment of Diminazene aceturate and Artesunate in vitro drug sensitivity test. It suggested that this relative quantification real-time PCR method can be used in evaluating the effects of inhibitory of drug.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the splicing machinery have been implicated in a number of human diseases. Most notably, the U2 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP) component SF3b1 has been found to be frequently mutated in blood cancers such as myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). SF3b1 is a highly conserved HEAT repeat (HR)-containing protein and most of these blood cancer mutations cluster in a hot spot located in HR4-8. Recently, a second mutational hotspot has been identified in SF3b1 located in HR9-12 and is associated with acute myeloid leukemias, bladder urothelial carcinomas, and uterine corpus endometrial carcinomas. The consequences of these mutations on SF3b1 functions during splicing have not yet been tested. We incorporated the corresponding mutations into the yeast homolog of SF3b1 and tested their impact on splicing. We find that all of these HR9-12 mutations can support splicing in yeast, and this suggests that none of them are loss of function alleles in humans. The Hsh155V502F mutation alters splicing of several pre-mRNA reporters containing weak branch sites as well as a genetic interaction with Prp2 and physical interactions with Prp5 and Prp3. The ability of a single allele of Hsh155 to perturb interactions with multiple factors functioning at different stages of the splicing reaction suggests that some SF3b1-mutant disease phenotypes may have a complex origin on the spliceosome.",

    "abstract": "Human activities are changing landscape structure and function globally, affecting wildlife space use, and ultimately increasing human-wildlife conflicts and zoonotic disease spread. Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a conflict species that has been implicated in the spread and amplification of the most lethal tick-borne disease in the world, the Brazilian spotted fever (BSF). Even though essential to understand the link between capybaras, ticks and the BSF, many knowledge gaps still exist regarding the effects of human disturbance in capybara space use. Here, we analyzed diurnal and nocturnal habitat selection strategies of capybaras across natural and human-modified landscapes using resource selection functions (RSF). Selection for forested habitats was high across human- modified landscapes, mainly during day- periods. Across natural landscapes, capybaras avoided forests during both day- and night periods. Water was consistently selected across both landscapes, during day- and nighttime. This variable was also the most important in predicting capybara habitat selection across natural landscapes. Capybaras showed slightly higher preferences for areas near grasses/shrubs across natural landscapes, and this variable was the most important in predicting capybara habitat selection across human-modified landscapes. Our results demonstrate human-driven variation in habitat selection strategies by capybaras. This behavioral adjustment across human-modified landscapes may be related to BSF epidemiology.",

    "abstract": "MotivationA common but critical task in genomic data analysis is finding features that separate and thereby help explain differences between two classes of biological objects, e.g., genes that explain the differences between healthy and diseased patients. As lower-cost, high-throughput experimental methods greatly increase the number of samples that are assayed as objects for analysis, computational methods are needed to quickly provide insights into high-dimensional datasets with tens of thousands of objects and features.\n\nResultsWe develop an interactive exploration tool called GO_SCPLOWENVISAGEC_SCPLOW that rapidly discovers the most discriminative feature pairs that best separate two classes in a dataset, and displays the corresponding visualizations. Since quickly finding top feature pairs is computationally challenging, especially when the numbers of objects and features are large, we propose a suite of optimizations to make GO_SCPLOWENVISAGEC_SCPLOW more responsive and demonstrate that our optimizations lead to a 400X speedup over competitive baselines for multiple biological data sets. With this speedup, GO_SCPLOWENVISAGEC_SCPLOW enables the exploration of more large-scale datasets and alternate hypotheses in an interactive and interpretable fashion. We apply GO_SCPLOWENVISAGEC_SCPLOW to uncover pairs of genes whose transcriptomic responses significantly discriminate treatments of several chemotherapy drugs.\n\nAvailabilityFree webserver at http://genvisage.knoweng.org:443/ with source code at https://github.com/KnowEnG/Genvisage",
