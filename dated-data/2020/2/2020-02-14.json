    "abstract": "Targeted amplicon sequencing methods, such as genotyping-in-thousands by sequencing (GT-seq), facilitate rapid, accurate, and cost-effective analysis of hundreds of genetic loci in thousands of individuals, but studies describing detailed workflows of GTseq panel development are rare. Here, we develop a dual-purpose GT-seq panel for walleye (Sander vitreus) and discuss trade-offs associated with different development and genotyping approaches. Our GT-seq panel was developed using restriction site-associated DNA data from 954 individuals sampled from 23 populations in Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA. We then conducted simulations to test the utility of loci for parentage analysis and genetic stock identification and designed 600 primer pairs to maximize joint accuracy for these analyses. We conducted three rounds of primer optimization to remove loci that overamplified and our final panel consisted of 436 loci. Optimization focused on reducing variation in amplification rate among loci and minimizing the proportion of off-target sequence, both of which are important considerations for developing large GT-seq panels. We also explored different approaches for DNA extraction, multiplexed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and cleanup steps during the GT-seq process and discovered the following: (1) inexpensive Chelex extractions performed well for genotyping, (2) the exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (ExoSAP) procedure included in some current protocols did not improve results substantially and was likely unnecessary, and (3) it was possible to PCR amplify panels separately and combine them prior to adapter ligation. Well-optimized GT-seq panels are valuable resources for conservation genetics and our findings should aid in their construction in myriad taxa.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence indicates that viral components of the microbiota can contribute to intestinal homeostasis and protection from local inflammatory or infectious insults. However, host-derived mechanisms that maintain tolerance to the virome remain largely unknown. Here, we use colonization with the model commensal murine norovirus (MNV CR6) to interrogate host-directed mechanisms of viral tolerance, and show that STAT1 is a central coordinator of tolerance following CR6 colonization. STAT1 restricts CR6 replication to the intestinal tract, prevents systemic viral-induced tissue damage and disease, and regulates antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. In contrast to systemic viral pathogens that drive T cell mediated immunopathology in STAT1-deficient mice, our data indicates that loss of CD4+ or CD8+ T cells and their associated effector functions has no effect on CR6-induced disease. However, therapeutic administration of an antiviral compound to limit viral replication prevented viral-induced tissue damage and death despite ongoing dysregulated antiviral T cell responses. Collectively, our data uncouple the requirement for STAT1-mediated regulation of antiviral T cell responses from innate immune-mediated restriction of viral replication that is necessary for intestinal viral tolerance.",

    "abstract": "There is growing evidence that phages with unusually large genomes are common across various natural and human microbiomes, but little is known about their genetic inventories or potential ecosystem impacts. Here, we reconstructed large phage genomes from freshwater lakes known to contain bacteria that oxidize methane. Twenty-two manually curated genomes (18 are complete) ranging from 159 to 527 kbp in length were found to encode the pmoC gene, an enzymatically critical subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase, the predominant methane oxidation catalyst in nature. The phage-associated PmoC show high similarity (> 90%) and affiliate phylogenetically with those of coexisting bacterial methanotrophs, and their abundance patterns correlate with the abundances of these bacteria, supporting host-phage relationships. We suggest that phage PmoC has similar functions to additional copies of PmoC encoded in bacterial genomes, thus contribute to growth on methane. Transcriptomics data from one system showed that the phage-associated pmoC genes are actively expressed in situ. Augmentation of bacterial methane oxidation by pmoC-phages during infection could modulate the efflux of this powerful greenhouse gas into the environment.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic de-regulation of -synuclein plays a key role in Parkinsons disease (PD). Analysis of the SNCA promoter using the ENCODE database revealed the presence of important histone posttranslational modifications (PTMs) including transcription-promoting marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, and repressive mark, H3K27me3. We investigated these histone marks in postmortem brains of controls and PD patients and observed that only H3K4me3 was significantly elevated at the SNCA promoter of the substantia nigra (SN) of PD patients both in punch biopsy as well as in NeuN positive neuronal nuclei samples. To understand the importance of H3K4me3 in regulation of -synuclein, we developed CRISPR/dCas9-based locus-specific H3K4me3 demethylating system where the catalytic domain of JARID1A was recruited to the SNCA promoter. This CRISPR/dCas9 SunTag-JARID1A significantly reduced H3K4me3 at SNCA promoter and concomitantly decreased -synuclein both in the neuronal cell line SH-SY5Y and idiopathic PD-iPSC derived dopaminergic neurons. In sum, this study indicates that -synuclein expression in PD is controlled by SNCAs histone PTMs and modulation of the histone landscape of SNCA can reduce -synuclein expression.",

    "abstract": "The neurotransmitter dopamine is implicated in diverse functions, including reward processing, reinforcement learning and cognitive control. The tendency to discount future rewards in value over time has long been discussed in the context of potential dopaminergic modulation. Here we examined the effect of a single dose of the D2 receptor antagonist Haloperidol (2mg) on temporal discounting. Our approach extends previous human pharmacological studies in two ways. First, we applied state-of-the-art computational modeling based on the drift diffusion model to comprehensively examine choice dynamics. Second, we examined dopaminergic modulation of reward magnitude effects on temporal discounting. Drift diffusion modeling revealed reduced temporal discounting and substantially faster non-decision times under Haloperidol. Temporal discounting was substantially increased for low vs. high reward magnitudes, but this magnitude effect was largely unaffected by Haloperidol. These results were corroborated by model-free analyses as well as modeling via more standard approaches using softmax action selection. We previously reported elevated caudate activation under Haloperidol in this sample of participants, supporting the idea that Haloperidol elevated dopamine neurotransmission, e.g. by blocking inhibitory feedback via presynaptic D2 autoreceptors. The present modeling results show that during inter-temporal choice, this leads to attenuated temporal discounting and increased response vigor (shorter non-decision times).",

    "abstract": "For decades, researchers have debated whether mental representations are symbolic or grounded in sensory inputs and motor programs. Certainly, aspects of mental representations are grounded. However, does the brain also contain abstract concept representations that mediate between perception and action in a flexible manner not tied to the details of sensory inputs and motor programs? Such conceptual pointers would be useful when concept remain constant despite changes in appearance and associated actions. We evaluated whether human participants acquire such representations using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants completed a probabilistic concept learning task in which sensory, motor, and category variables were not perfectly coupled nor entirely independent, making it possible to observe evidence for abstract representations or purely grounded representations. To assess how the learned concept structure is represented in the brain, we examined brain regions implicated in flexible cognition (e.g., prefrontal and parietal cortex) that are most likely to encode an abstract representation removed from sensory-motor details. We also examined sensory-motor regions that might encode grounded sensory-motor based representations tuned for categorization. Using a cognitive model to estimate participants category rule and multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data, we found left prefrontal cortex and MT coded for category in absence of information coding for stimulus or response. Because category was based on the stimulus, finding an abstract representation of category was not inevitable. Our results suggest that certain brain areas support categorization behaviour by constructing concept representations in a format akin to a symbol that differs from stimulus-motor codes.",

A similar improvement in insulin secretion was observed in regular chow and HFD rats in vivo. Insulin secretion and cytosolic Ca2+ during PK activation were dependent on PCK2.

    "abstract": "The use of microalgal biomass for metal pollutant bioremediation might be improved by genetic engineering to modify the selectivity or capacity of metal biosorption. A plant cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn) transporter (AtHMA4) was used as a transgene to increase the ability of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to tolerate 0.2 mM Cd and 0.3 mM Zn exposure. The transgenic cells showed increased accumulation and internalisation of both metals compared to wild type. AtHMA4 was expressed either as the full-length protein or just the C-terminal tail, which is known to have metal binding sites. Similar Cd and Zn tolerance and accumulation was observed with expression of either the full-length protein or C-terminal domain, suggesting that enhanced metal tolerance was mainly due to increased metal binding rather than metal transport. The effectiveness of the transgenic cells was further examined by immobilisation in calcium alginate to generate microalgal beads that could be added to a metal contaminated solution. Immobilisation maintained metal tolerance, while AtHMA4-expressing cells in alginate showed a concentration-dependent increase in metal biosorption that was significantly greater than alginate beads composed of wild type cells. This demonstrates that expressing AtHMA4 full-length or C-terminus has great potential as a strategy for bioremediation using microalgal biomass.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

The AUC-ROC curve corresponding to the \"Neural Network\" algorithm is slightly steeper implying higher \"true positive percentage\" achieved with this model.

    "abstract": "The Wnt pathway is a key intercellular signaling cascade that regulates development, tissue homeostasis, and regeneration. However, gaps remain in our understanding of the molecular events that take place between ligand-receptor binding and target gene transcription. Here we used a novel tool for quantitative, real-time assessment of endogenous pathway activation, measured in single cells, to answer an unresolved question in the field - whether receptor endocytosis is required for Wnt signal transduction. We combined knockdown or knockout of essential components of Clathrin-mediated endocytosis with quantitative assessment of Wnt signal transduction in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Disruption of Clathrin-mediated endocytosis did not affect accumulation and nuclear translocation of {beta}-catenin, as measured by single-cell live imaging of endogenous {beta}-catenin, and subsequent target gene transcription. Disruption of another receptor endocytosis pathway, Caveolin-mediated endocytosis, did not affect Wnt pathway activation either. These results, confirmed in multiple cell lines, suggest that endocytosis is not a general requirement for Wnt signal transduction. We show that off-target effects of a drug used to inhibit endocytosis may be one source of the discrepancy among reports on the role of endocytosis in Wnt signaling.",

Although the bacterial composition of the nasal passages have been well characterized in healthy and diseased cohorts, the role of prolonged environmental exposures and exercise in shaping the nasal microbiome in healthy adults is poorly understood.

Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we evaluated the longitudinal dynamics of the nasal microbiome pre-, during-, and at the end of the athletic season.\n\nResultsThe nasal microbiota of the Swim/Dive and Basketball teams were distinct from each other at each time point sampled, driven by either low abundance (Jaccard, PERMANOVA p<0.05) or high-abundance changes in composition (Bray-Curtis, PERMANOVA p<0.05). The rate of change of microbial communities were greater in the Swim/Dive team compared to the Basketball team characterized by an increase in Staphylococcus in Swim/Dive and a decrease in Corynebacterium in both teams over time.\n\nConclusionsThis is the first study that has evaluated the nasal microbiome in athletes. We obtained longitudinal nasal swabs from two gender-matched teams with similar age distributions (18-22 years old) over a 6 month period. Differences in the microbiota between teams and over time indicate that chlorine exposure, and potentially athletic training, induced changes in the nasal microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Disorders of bile acids (BAs) are closely related to the development of liver and intestinal diseases, including acute pancreatitis (AP). However, the mechanism underlying the involvement of BAs in AP development remains unclear. We used intraperitoneal injection of cerulein to construct AP mouse models. These mice had significantly reduced tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and an imbalance of intestinal microbiota, based on 16S rDNA gene sequencing. To explore the role of AP-induced intestinal microbiota changes in the development of AP, we transplanted stool obtained from AP mice to antibiotic-treated, microbiota-depleted healthy mice. Microbiota-depleted mice presented injury to the intestinal barrier function and pancreas. Additionally, microbiota depletion reduced AP-associated pancreatic injury. This indicated that the gut microbiota may worsen AP. As TUDCA was deficient in AP mice, we gavaged AP mice with it, and evaluated subsequent expression changes in the bile acid signaling receptors farnesoid-x-receptor (FXR) and its target gene fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 15. These were downregulated, and pancreatic and intestinal barrier function injury were mitigated. Similar results were found in microbiota-depleted AP without BA treatment. However, we did not observe further downregulation of the FXR signaling pathway in microbiota-depleted AP mice given TUDCA, indicating that improvement of pancreatitis by TUDCA may be associated with gut microbiota. Our analysis of changes to the gut microbiota in AP indicated that Lactobacilli may be the key contributors. Taken together, our study shows that supplementation with BAs could improve bile acid-FXR-FGF15 signaling, and reduce pancreatic and intestinal injury, and that this effect may be associated with the gut microbiota.",

    "abstract": "Lipid droplets (LDs) are dynamic cytoplasmic organelles present in most eukaryotic cells. The appearance of LDs in neurons is not usually observed under physiological conditions, but is associated with neural diseases. It remains unclear how LD dynamics is regulated in neurons and how the appearance of LDs affects neuronal functions. We discovered that mutations of two key lipolysis genes atgl-1 and lid-1 lead to LD appearance in neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans. This neuronal lipid accumulation protects neurons from hyperactivation-triggered neurodegeneration, with a mild decrease in touch sensation. We also discovered that reduced biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) causes similar effects, synergistically with decreased lipolysis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these changes in lipolysis and PUFA biosynthesis increase PUFA partitioning toward triacylglycerol, and reduced incorporation of PUFAs into phospholipids increases neuronal protection. Together, these results suggest the crucial role of neuronal lipolysis in regulating neural functions and neurodegeneration cell-autonomously.\n\nHighlightsO_LINeuronal lipolysis prevents LD accumulation in neurons.\nC_LIO_LIDefective neuronal lipolysis leads to touch sensation defect.\nC_LIO_LIBlocking neuronal lipolysis alleviates neurodegeneration.\nC_LIO_LINeuronal lipolysis and de novo PUFA biosynthesis have a synergistic effect in neurodegeneration.\nC_LIO_LIThe incorporation of PUFAs into phospholipids promotes neurodegeneration.\nC_LI",

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other organisms, functional screens have generated rich lists of phenotypes associated with individual genes. However, it is often challenging to identify sets of phenotypes and genes that are most closely associated with a given biological process. Here, we focused on the 166 phenotypes arising from loss-of-function and the 86 phenotypes from gain-of-function mutations in 571 genes currently assigned to cell cycle-related ontologies in S. cerevisiae. To reduce this complexity, we applied unbiased, computational approaches of correspondence analysis to identify a minimum set of phenotypic variables that accounts for as much of the variability in the data as possible. Loss-of-function phenotypes can be reduced to 20 dimensions, while gain-of-function ones to 14 dimensions. We also pinpoint the contributions of phenotypes and genes in each set. The approach we describe not only simplifies the categorization of phenotypes associated with cell cycle progression but can also serve as a discovery tool for gene function.",

Multiple competing technologies have been developed to improve the quality and robustness of genome assemblies during the last decade. The two widely-used long read sequencing providers - Pacbio (PB) and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) - have recently updated their platforms: PB enable high throughput HiFi reads with base-level resolution with >99% and ONT generated reads as long as 2 Mb. We applied the two up-to-date platforms to one single rice individual, and then compared the two assemblies to investigate the advantages and limitations of each. The results showed that ONT ultralong reads delivered higher contiguity producing a total of 18 contigs of which 10 were assembled into a single chromosome compared to that of 394 contigs and three chromosome-level contigs for the PB assembly. The ONT ultralong reads also prevented assembly errors caused by long repetitive regions for which we observed a total 44 genes of false redundancies and 10 genes of false losses in the PB assembly leading to over/under-estimations of the gene families in those long repetitive regions. We also noted that the PB HiFi reads generated assemblies with considerably less errors at the level of single nucleotide and small InDels than that of the ONT assembly which generated an average 1.06 errors per Kb assembly and finally engendered 1,475 incorrect gene annotations via altered or truncated protein predictions.",

    "abstract": "Cytokine signaling is challenging to study and therapeutically exploit as the effects of these protein are often pleiotropic. A subset of cytokines can, however, exert signal specificity via association with latency-inducing proteins which cage the cytokine until disrupted by discreet biological stimuli. Inspired by this precision, here we describe a strategy for synthetic induction of cytokine latency via modification with photo-labile polymers that mimic latency while attached, then restore protein activity in response to light, thus controlling the magnitude, duration, and location of cytokine signals. We characterize the high dynamic range of latent cytokine activity modulation and find that polymer-induced latency, alone, can prolong in vivo circulation and bias receptor subunit binding. We further show that protein de-repression can be achieved with near single-cell resolution and demonstrate the feasibility of transcutaneous photoactivation. Future extensions of this approach could enable multicolor, optical reprogramming of cytokine signaling networks and more precise immunotherapies.",

We show that CSOmap can successfully recapitulate the spatial organization of tumor microenvironments for multiple cancers and reveal molecular determinants of cellular interactions. Further, CSOmap readily simulates perturbation of genes or cell types to gain novel biological insights, especially into how immune cells interact in the tumor microenvironment. CSOmap can be widely applicable to interrogate cellular organizations based on scRNA-seq data for various tissues in diverse systems.",

    "abstract": "Soil microorganisms influence a variety of processes in plant communities. Many the-oretical and empirical studies have shown that dynamic feedbacks between plants and soil microbes can stabilize plant coexistence by generating negative frequency-dependent plant population dynamics. However, inferring the net effects of soil microbes on plant coexistence requires also quantifying the degree to which they provide one species an average fitness advantage, an effect that has received little empirical attention. We conducted a greenhouse study to quantify microbially mediated stabilization and fitness differences among fifteen pairs of annual plants that co-occur in southern California grasslands. We found that although soil microbes frequently generate negative frequency-dependent dynamics that stabilize plant interactions, they simultaneously mediate large average fitness differences between species. The net result is that if the plant species are otherwise competitively equivalent, the impact of plant-soil feedbacks is often to favor species exclusion over coexistence, a result that only becomes evident by quantifying the microbially mediated fitness difference. Our work highlights that comparing the stabilizing effects of plant-soil feedbacks to the fitness difference they generate is essential for understanding the influence of soil microbes on plant diversity.",

Most eQTM methylation probes were distant from their target genes, and more likely located in enhancer regions of their target genes in lung tissue than control probes. The top 500 eQTM genes were enriched in pathways for immune processes and epithelial integrity, and also more likely to be differentially expressed in atopic asthma. Moreover, we identified 5,934 paths through which methylation probes could affect atopic asthma through gene expression.

Evidence suggests that these functions of CGGBP1 manifest through binding to GC-rich regions in the genome and regulation of interspersed repeats. Recent works show that CGGBP1 is needed for cytosine methylation homeostasis and genome-wide occupancy patterns of the epigenome regulator protein CTCF. It has remained unknown if cytosine methylation regulation and CTCF occupancy regulation by CGGBP1 are independent or interdependent processes. By sequencing immunoprecipitated methylated DNA, we have found that some transcription factor-binding sites resist stochastic changes in cytosine methylation. Of these, we have analyzed the CTCF-binding sites thoroughly and show that cytosine methylation regulation at CTCF-binding DNA sequence motifs by CGGBP1 is deterministic. These CTCF-binding sites are positioned at locations where the spread of cytosine methylation in cis depends on the levels of CGGBP1. Our findings suggest that CTCF occupancy and functions are determined by CGGBP1-regulated cytosine methylation patterns.",

However, no study has examined such antibodies in etiologically-relevant periods before diagnosis.

We examined associations to any ASD diagnosis and considering common comorbidities (i.e. intellectual disability [ID] and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD]). We compared 206 ASD cases to their unaffected siblings to examine the potential for confounding by shared familial factors.\n\nResultsHigh levels ([&ge;]90th percentile) of maternal AGA were associated with decreased odds of ASD, particularly ASD with comorbid ID, when measured in NDBS (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.30-0.87) with a similar trend in maternal sera (0.55, 0.24-1.29).

Validated QTL for all three collocate on chromosome 3A in the Avalon x Cadenza population. We asked if these are linked or pleiotropic effects. The region was dissected using recombinants derived from Near Isogenic Lines. It was shown that Ht and Hd are controlled by independent genes. The newly defined Ht QTL interval contained a gene cluster involved in cell wall growth and displaying high levels of differential transcript expression. The Hd locus is much larger and rearranged compared to the reference genome but FT2 is a candidate of particular interest. The Hd effect was shown to act independently of photoperiod and vernalization but did exhibit genotype x environment interaction suggesting a role in ambient temperature sensitivity. It was the Hd locus that was most associated with increased GY of Cadenza alleles, supporting physiological studies proposing that  late alleles at this locus increase spike fertility and grain number. The work has uncoupled height from heading and yield and shown that one of very few validated GY QTL in wheat is probably mediated by phenological variation.\n\nHighlightThere only are three validated wheat yield QTL.

    "abstract": "Fungal diseases are responsible for the deaths of over 1.5 million people worldwide annually. Antifungal peptides represent a useful source of antifungals with novel mechanisms-of-action, and potentially provide new methods of overcoming resistance. Here we investigate the mode-of-action of the small, rationally designed synthetic antifungal peptide PAF26 using the model fungus Neurospora crassa. Here we show that the cell killing activity of PAF26 is dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and the presence of fully functioning fungal Ca2+ homeostatic/signalling machinery. In a screen of mutants with deletions in Ca2+-signalling machinery, we identified three mutants more tolerant to PAF26. The Ca2+ ATPase NCA-2 was found to be involved in the initial interaction of PAF26 with the cell envelope. The vacuolar Ca2+ channel YVC-1 was shown to be essential for its accumulation and concentration within the vacuolar system. The Ca2+ channel CCH-1 was found to be required to prevent the translocation of PAF26 across the plasma membrane. In the wild type, Ca2+ removal from the medium resulted in the peptide remaining trapped in small vesicles as in the{Delta} yvc-1 mutant. It is therefore apparent that cell killing by PAF26 is complex and unusually dependent on extracellular Ca2+ and components of the Ca2+-regulatory machinery.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLife threatening diseases can be caused when fungi invade human tissues. These invasions often occur when a persons immune defences are down, often due to treatments for cancer or transplantation. These infections are commonly buried deep within the body and as such are difficult to access and treat. Current medications are often highly toxic to the patient. There is also a worrying rise in drug resistance seen in fungi sampled from patients, with infections effectively untreatable - a death sentence. Antifungal peptides such as PAF26 provide a possible solution by offering a cheap and rapidly produced alternative to conventional drugs. However, unlike antibacterial peptides, little is known about how these small molecules mostly exert their effects and cause death. Using live-cell imaging and deletion mutants, this study provides an analysis of the important roles that Ca2+-homeostasis and Ca2+-signalling, and possible accompanying vacuolar fusion, play during the dynamic internalization and interaction with and within the fungal cell following PAF26 treatment.",

Moreover, the effects of these mutations have been shown to differ across sexes and environments. The mechanisms that explain the manifold array of mitochondrial genotypic effects on organismal function, and their context-dependency, have however remained a mystery. Here, we present evidence that mitochondria are involved in nuclear gene regulation via RNA interference; transcribing mitochondrial (mt-)miRNAs that may repress the transcription of nuclear genes that previously had no known involvement in mitochondrial function. Our findings uncover a new mechanism by which mitochondria may shape the expression of animal life-histories and health components; implying that the influence of the mitochondria in regulating organismal function extends well beyond the process of energy production.",

    "abstract": "The antibacterial efficacy of the tetracycline antibiotics has been greatly reduced by the development of resistance, hence a decline in their clinical use as antibiotics. The hok/sok locus is a type I toxin/antitoxin plasmid stability element, often associated with multi-drug resistance plasmids, especially ESBL-encoding plasmids. It enhances host cell survivability and pathogenicity in stressful growth conditions, and particularly increases bacterial tolerance to {beta}-lactam antibiotics. The hok/sok locus forms dsRNA by RNA:RNA interactions of the toxin and antitoxin, and doxycycline has been reported to bind and inhibit dsRNA cleavage/processing. This study investigated the antibacterial efficacy of doxycycline in hok/sok host bacteria cells, the effect on hok/sok-induced growth changes and the potential mechanism of the observed changes. Different strains of E. coli with growth characteristics affected by the hok/sok locus were transformed with hok/sok plasmids, and assessed for doxycycline susceptibility and growth changes. The results show that the hok/sok locus increases bacterial susceptibility to doxycycline, especially in strains with more pronounced hok/sok growth effects. The increased doxycycline susceptibility occurs despite {beta}-lactam resistance imparted by hok/sok. Doxycycline was found to induce bacterial death in a manner phenotypically characteristic of Hok toxin expression, suggesting that it inhibits the toxin/antitoxin dsRNA degradation, leading to Hok toxin expression and cell death. In this way, doxycycline could be used to counteract the multi-drug resistance plasmid maintenance/propagation and pathogenicity mechanisms associated with the hok/sok locus. This has great potentials in the global war to contain the rise in antimicrobial resistance.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions are biased towards previous decisions. Previous research suggests that this choice repetition bias is increased after previous decisions of high confidence, as inferred from response time measures (Urai et al., 2017), but also when previous decisions were based on weak sensory evidence (Akaishi et al., 2014). As weak sensory evidence is typically associated with low confidence, these previous findings appear conflicting. To resolve this conflict, we set out to investigate the effect of decision confidence on choice repetition more directly by measuring explicit confidence ratings in a motion coherence discrimination task. Moreover, we explored how choice and stimulus history jointly affect subsequent perceptual choices. We found that participants were more likely to repeat previous choices of high subjective confidence, as well as previous fast choices, confirming the boost of choice repetition with decision confidence. Furthermore, we discovered that current choices were biased away from the previous evidence direction, not previous choice, and that this effect grew with previous evidence strength. These findings point towards simultaneous biases of choice repetition, modulated by decision confidence, and adaptation, modulated by the strength of evidence, which bias current perceptual decisions in opposite directions.",

    "abstract": "Training can improve motor skills and modify neural activity at rest and during movement execution. Learning-related modulations may also concern motor preparation but the neural correlates and the potential behavioral relevance of such adjustments remain unclear. In humans, preparatory processes have been largely investigated using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with several studies reporting decreased corticospinal excitability (CSE) relative to a baseline measure; a phenomenon called preparatory suppression. Here, we investigated the effect of motor training on preparatory suppression of CSE in humans, as compared to modulatory changes at rest. We trained participants to initiate quick movements in an instructed-delay reaction time (RT) task and used TMS to investigate changes in CSE over the practice blocks. Training on the task speeded up RTs, with no repercussion on error rates. Training also increased baseline CSE at rest. Most interestingly, we found that motor activity during action preparation did not mirror the training-related rise in resting CSE. Rather, the degree of preparatory suppression from the rising baseline strengthened with practice. This training-related change in preparatory suppression predicted RT gains (but not the changes in baseline CSE): subjects showing a stronger expansion of preparatory suppression were also those exhibiting larger gains in RTs. Finally, such relationship between RTs and preparatory suppression was also evident at the single-trial level: RTs were generally faster in trials where preparatory suppression was deeper. These findings suggest that training induces changes in motor preparatory processes that are linked to an enhanced ability to initiate fast movements.\n\nNew and NoteworthyAny movement is preceded by a period of preparation, which involves a broad suppression of the corticospinal pathway, a phenomenon called preparatory suppression. Here, we show that motor training strengthens preparatory suppression and that this strengthening is associated with an acceleration of movement initiation. Our findings yield an extension of former work, highlighting a key role of preparatory suppression in training-driven behavioral improvements.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive performance in children is predictive of academic and social outcomes; therefore, understanding neurobiological mechanisms underlying individual differences in cognition during development may be important for improving quality of life. The belief that a single, psychological construct underlies many cognitive processes is pervasive throughout society. However, it is unclear if there is a consistent neural substrate underlying many cognitive processes. Here we show that a distributed configuration of cortical surface area and apparent thickness, when controlling for global imaging measures, is differentially associated with cognitive performance on different types of tasks in a large sample (N=10,145) of 9-11 year old children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) study. The minimal overlap in these regionalization patterns of association has implications for competing theories about developing intellectual functions. Surprisingly, not controlling for sociodemographic factors increased the similarity between these regionalization patterns. This highlights the importance of understanding the shared variance between sociodemographic factors, cognition and brain structure, particularly with a population-based sample such as ABCD.",

    "abstract": "Language is one of the most defining human capabilities, involving the coordination of brain networks that generalise the meaning of linguistic units of varying complexity. On a neural level, neocortical slow oscillations and thalamic spindles during sleep facilitate the reactivation of newly encoded memory traces, manifesting in distinct oscillatory activity during retrieval. However, it is currently unknown if the effect of sleep on memory extends to the generalisation of the mechanisms that subserve sentence comprehension. We address this question by analysing electroencephalogram data recorded from 35 participants during an artificial language learning task and an 8hr nocturnal sleep period. We found that a period of sleep was associated with increased alpha/beta power and improved behavioural performance. Phase amplitude coupling analyses also revealed that spindle-slow oscillation coupling predicted the consolidation of sequence-based word orders, which was associated with distinct patterns of oscillatory activity during sentence processing. Taken together, this study presents converging behavioural and neurophysiological evidence for a role of sleep in the consolidation of higher order language learning and associated oscillatory neural activity.",

    "abstract": "In temporal lobe epilepsy, the ability of the dentate gyrus to limit excitatory cortical input to the hippocampus breaks down, leading to seizures. The dentate gyrus is also thought to help discriminate between similar memories by performing pattern separation, but whether epilepsy leads to a breakdown in this neural computation, and thus to mnemonic discrimination impairments, remains unknown. Here we show that temporal lobe epilepsy is characterized by behavioral deficits in mnemonic discrimination tasks, in both humans (females and males) and mice (C57Bl6 males, systemic low-dose kainate model). Using a recently developed assay in brain slices of the same epileptic mice, we reveal a decreased ability of the dentate gyrus to perform certain forms of pattern separation. This is due to a subset of granule cells with abnormal bursting that can develop independently of early EEG abnormalities. Overall, our results linking physiology, computation and cognition in the same mice advance our understanding of episodic memory mechanisms and their dysfunction in epilepsy.\n\nSignificance StatementPeople with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) often have learning and memory impairments, sometimes occurring earlier than the first seizure, but those symptoms and their biological underpinnings are poorly understood. We focused on the dentate gyrus, a brain region that is critical to avoid confusion between similar memories and is anatomically disorganized in TLE. We show that both humans and mice with TLE experience confusion between similar situations. This impairment coincides with a failure of the dentate gyrus to disambiguate similar input signals because of pathological bursting in a subset of neurons. Our work bridges seizure-oriented and memory-oriented views of the dentate gyrus function, suggests a mechanism for cognitive symptoms in TLE and supports a long-standing hypothesis of episodic memory theories.",

The xylem vessels are supported by strong cell walls that are assembled in intricate patterns. Cortical microtubules direct wall deposition and need to rapidly re-organize during xylem cell development. We established long-term live-cell imaging of single Arabidopsis cells undergoing proto-xylem trans-differentiation, resulting in spiral wall patterns, to investigate the microtubule re-organization. The initial disperse microtubule array rapidly readjusted into well-defined microtubule bands, which required local de-stabilization of individual microtubules in band-interspersing gap regions. Using extensive microtubule simulations, we could recapitulate the process in silico and found that local recruitment of microtubule-bound nucleation is critical for pattern formation, which we confirmed in vivo. Our simulations further indicated that the initial microtubule alignment impact microtubule band patterning. We confirmed this prediction using katanin mutants, which have microtubule organization defects, and uncovered active KATANIN recruitment to the forming microtubule bands. Our combination of quantitative microscopy and modelling outlines a framework towards a comprehensive understanding of microtubule re-organization during wall pattern formation.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a conserved intracellular degradation pathway that has recently emerged as an integral part of plant responses to virus infection. The elucidated mechanisms of autophagy range from the selective degradation of viral components to a more general attenuation of disease symptoms. In addition, several viruses are able to manipulate the autophagy machinery and counteract autophagy-dependent resistance. Despite these findings, the complex interplay of autophagy activities, viral pathogenicity factors, and host defence pathways in disease development remains poorly understood. In the current study, we analysed the interaction between autophagy and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that autophagy is induced during CMV infection and promotes the turnover of the major CMV virulence protein and RNA silencing suppressor 2b. Intriguingly, 2b itself dampens plant autophagy. In accordance with 2b degradation, we found that autophagy provides resistance against CMV by reducing viral RNA accumulation in an RNA silencing-dependent manner. Moreover, autophagy and RNA silencing pathways contribute to plant longevity and fecundity of CMV infected plants in an additive manner, uncoupling it from resistance. In addition to reduced fecundity, autophagy-deficient plants also failed to support seed transmission of the virus. We propose that autophagy attenuates CMV virulence via 2b degradation and thereby increases both plant and virus fitness with a trade-off penalty arising from increased RNA silencing-mediated resistance.\n\nAuthor summaryThe capacity of plants to fight pathogenic viruses in order to survive and minimize damage relies on profound cellular reprogramming events. These include the synthesis of new as well as the degradation of pre-existing cellular components, together shifting cellular homeostasis towards a better tolerance of disease and fortification of antiviral defence mechanisms. Autophagy is a prominent and highly conserved cellular degradation pathway that supports plant stress resilience. Autophagy functions vary broadly and range from rather unspecific renewal of cytoplasm to highly selective degradation of a wide collection of specific substrates. Autophagy is well established to be involved during virus infections in animals, and its importance has also recently emerged in virus diseases of plants. However, we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of the complexity of autophagy activities in host-virus interactions and how autophagy pathway engineering could be applied against viruses. Here, we have analyzed one of the traditional model plant viruses, Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), and its interactions with autophagy. Our study revealed that autophagy is tightly integrated into CMV disease, influencing processes from plant health to CMV epidemiology.",

    "abstract": "One of the major goals in large-scale genomic studies is to identify genes with a prognostic impact on time-to-event outcomes which provide insight into the diseases process. With rapid developments in high-throughput genomic technologies in the past two decades, the scientific community is able to monitor the expression levels of tens of thousands of genes and proteins resulting in enormous data sets where the number of genomic features is far greater than the number of subjects. Methods based on univariate Cox regression are often used to select genomic features related to survival outcome; however, the Cox model assumes proportional hazards (PH), which is unlikely to hold for each feature. When applied to genomic features exhibiting some form of non-proportional hazards (NPH), these methods could lead to an under- or over-estimation of the effects. We propose a broad array of marginal screening techniques that aid in feature ranking and selection by accommodating various forms of NPH. First, we develop an approach based on Kullback-Leibler information divergence and the Yang-Prentice model that includes methods for the PH and proportional odds (PO) models as special cases. Next, we propose R2 indices for the PH and PO models that can be interpreted in terms of explained randomness. Lastly, we propose a generalized pseudo-R2 measure that includes PH, PO, crossing hazards and crossing odds models as special cases and can be interpreted as the percentage of separability between subjects experiencing the event and not experiencing the event according to feature expression. We evaluate the performance of our measures using extensive simulation studies and publicly available data sets in cancer genomics. We demonstrate that the proposed methods successfully address the issue of NPH in genomic feature selection and outperform existing methods. The proposed information divergence, R2 and pseudo-R2 measures were implemented in R (www.R-project.org) and code is available upon request.",

    "abstract": "How the noisy expression of regulatory proteins affects timing of intracellular events is an intriguing fundamental problem that influences diverse cellular processes. Here we use the bacteriophage {lambda} to study event timing in individual cells where cell lysis is the result of expression and accumulation of a single protein (holin) in the Escherchia coli cell membrane up to a critical threshold level. Site-directed mutagenesis of the holin gene was used to generate phage variants that vary in their timing of lysis from 30 to 190 min. Observation of the lysis times of single cells reveals an intriguing finding - the noise in lysis timing first decreases with increasing lysis time to reach a minimum, and then sharply increases at longer longer lysis times. A mathematical model with stochastic expression of holin together with dilution from cell growth was sufficient to explain the non-monotonic noise profile, and identify holin accumulation thresholds that generate precision in lysis timing.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of genomic stability during the cell cycle of progenitor cells is essential for the faithful transmission of genetic information. Mutations in genes that ensure genome stability lead to human developmental syndromes. Mutations in Ataxia Telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) or in ATR-interacting protein (ATRIP) lead to Seckel syndrome, which is characterized by developmental malformations and short life expectancy. While the roles of ATR in replicative stress response and chromosomal segregation are well established, it is unknown how ATRIP contributes to maintaining genomic stability in progenitor cells in vivo. Here, we generated the first mouse model to investigate ATRIP function. Conditional inactivation of Atrip in progenitor cells of the CNS and eye led to microcephaly, microphthalmia and postnatal lethality. To understand the mechanisms underlying these malformations, we used lens progenitor cells as a model and found that ATRIP loss promotes replicative stress and TP53-dependent cell death. Trp53 inactivation in Atrip-deficient progenitor cells rescued apoptosis but increased mitotic DNA damage and mitotic defects. Our findings demonstrate an essential role of ATRIP in preventing DNA damage accumulation during unchallenged replication.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInborn errors of cholesterol metabolism occur as a result of mutations in the cholesterol synthesis pathway (CSP). Although mutations in the CSP cause a multiple congenital anomaly syndrome, craniofacial abnormalities are a hallmark phenotype associated with these disorders. Previous studies have established that mutation of the zebrafish hmgcs1 gene (Vu57 allele), which encodes the first enzyme in the CSP, causes defects in craniofacial development and abnormal neural crest cell (NCC) differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the products of the CSP disrupt NCC differentiation are not completely known. Cholesterol is known to regulate the activity of WNT signaling, an established regulator of NCC differentiation. We hypothesized that defects in cholesterol synthesis reduce WNT signaling, consequently resulting in abnormal craniofacial development.\n\nMethodsTo test our hypothesis we performed a combination of pharmaceutical inhibition, gene expression assays, and targeted rescue experiments to understand the function of CSP and WNT signaling during craniofacial development.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate reduced expression of axin2, a WNT downstream target gene in homozygous carriers of the Vu57 allele and in larvae treated with Ro-48-8071, which inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol. Moreover, activation of WNT signaling via treatment with a WNT agonist completely restored the craniofacial defects present in the Vu57 allele.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, these data suggest interplay between the CSP and WNT signaling during craniofacial development.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEEG is the oldest tool for studying human cognitive function, but it is blamed to be useless because its poor spatial resolution despite it excellent temporal discrimination. Such comments arise from a reductionist point of view about the cerebral function. However, if the brain is assumed to be a distributed processing system recruiting different types of cells widely distribute over the cortex, then EEG temporal resolution and the many different tools available for its analysis, turn it the tool of choice to investigate human cognition.\n\nProposalTo better understand the different types of information encoded in the recorded cortical electrical activity, a clear model of the cortical structure and function of the different cortical column layers is presented and discussed. Taking this model into consideration, different available techniques for EEG analysis are discussed, under the assumption that tool combination is a necessity to provide a full comprehension of dynamics of the cortical activity supporting human cognition.\n\nMethodologyThe present approach combines many of the existing methods of analysis to extract better and richer information from the EEG, and proposes additional analysis to better characterize many of the EEG components identified by these different methods.\n\nAnalysisData on language understanding published elsewhere are used to illustrate how to use this combined and complex EEG analysis to disclose important details of cognitive cerebral dynamics, which reveal that cognitive neural circuits are scale free networks supporting entrainment of a large number of cortical column assemblies distributed all over the cortex.\n\nConclusionsReasoning is then assumed to result from a well orchestrated large scale entrainment",

Although the SoA has been associated with mental health and well-being, it is still unknown how interindividual variability in the SoA is embedded in the intrinsic brain organization. We hypothesized that the prospective component of an implicit SoA is associated with brain networks related to SoA and sensorimotor predictions on multiple spatial scales. We replicated previous findings by showing a significant prospective SoA as indicated by intentional binding effects. Then, using task-free functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and graph analysis, we analyzed associations between intentional binding effects and the intrinsic brain organization at regional, modular, and whole-brain scales. The results showed that inter-modular connections of a fronto-parietal module including the premotor cortex, supramarginal gyrus, and dorsal precuneus are associated with individual differences in prospective intentional binding. Notably, prospective intentional binding effects were also related to global brain modularity within a specific structural resolution range. These findings suggest that an implicit SoA generated through sensorimotor predictions relies on the intrinsic organization of the brain connectome on both local and global scales.",

    "abstract": "Sixty years ago, bacterial cell size was found as an exponential function of growth rate. Fifty years ago, a more general relationship was proposed, in which the cell mass was equal to the initiation mass multiplied by the ratio of the total time of the C and D periods to the doubling time. This relationship has recently been experimentally confirmed by perturbing doubling time, C period, D period or the initiation mass. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we developed a mechanistic and kinetic model to describe how the initiator protein DnaA mediates the initiation of DNA replication in E. coli. In the model, we introduced an initiation probability function involving competitive binding of DnaA-ATP (active) and DnaA-ADP (inactive) at replication origin to determine the initiation of replication. In addition, we considered RNAP availability, ppGpp inhibition, DnaA autorepression, DnaA titration by chromosomal sites, hydrolysis of DnaA-ATP along with DNA replication, reactivation of DnaA-ADP and established a kinetic description of these DnaA regulatory processes. We simulated DnaA kinetics and obtained a self-consistent cell size and a regular DnaA oscillation coordinated with the cell cycle at steady state. The relationship between the cell size obtained by the simulation and the growth rate, C period, D period or initiation mass reproduces the results of the experiment. This model also predicts how the number of DnaA and the initiation mass vary with the perturbation parameters (including those reflecting the mutation or interference of DnaA regulatory processes), which is comparable to experimental data. The results suggest that the regulatory mechanisms of DnaA level and activity are associated with the invariance of initiation mass and the cell size general relationship for matching frequencies of replication initiation and cell division. This study may provide clues for concerted control of cell size and cell cycle in synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "The number, position, and configuration of double bonds in lipid acyl chains affects membrane packing, fluidity, and recruitment of signalling proteins. Studies on mammalian sphingolipids have focused on those with a saturated sphinganine or mono-unsaturated sphingosine long chain base. Sphingolipids with a diunsaturated sphingadiene base have been reported but are poorly characterised. Employing high-resolution untargeted mass spectrometry, we observed marked accumulation of lipids containing a sphingadiene base, but not those with a more common sphingosine backbone, in the hippocampus of mice lacking the metabolic enzyme sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2). Applying ultraviolet photodissociation tandem mass spectrometry (UVPD-MS/MS) the double bonds were confidently assigned to the C4-C5 and C14-C15 positions of the sphingoid base. Sphingosine kinases are involved in lysosomal catabolism of all sphingolipids, producing sphingoid base phosphates that are irreversibly degraded by sphingosine 1-phosphate lyase. Both SphK1 and SphK2 phosphorylated sphinga-4,14-diene as efficiently as sphingosine, however deuterated tracer experiments demonstrated that ceramides with a sphingosine base are more rapidly metabolised in cultured cells than those with a sphingadiene base. SphK2 silencing significantly impeded the catabolism of both sphingosine- and sphingadiene-based sphingolipids. Since SphK2 is the dominant sphingosine kinase in brain, we propose that accumulation of sphingadiene lipids in SphK2-deficient brains results from the intrinsically slower catabolism of sphingadiene lipids, combined with a bottleneck in the catabolic pathway created by the absence of SphK2. We speculate that accumulation of these lipids in the absence of SphK2 function may affect the fluidity and signalling properties of cell membranes.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWLow-energy deammonification under mainstream conditions is a technology that has received significant attention in recent years as the water industry drives towards long-term sustainability goals. Simultaneous partial nitritation-Anammox (PN/A) is one process that can provide substantial energy reduction and lower sludge yields. Mathematical modelling of such a process offers engineers insights into the conditions for maximising the potential of PN/A. Laureni et al., Water Res. (2019) have recently published a reduced mechanistic model of the process in a sequencing batch reactor, which indicates the effect of three key operating parameters (Anammox biofilm activity, dissolved oxygen concentration and fraction of solids wasted) on performance. The analysis of the model is limited, however, to simulation with relatively few discrete parameter sets. Here, we demonstrate through the use of bifurcation theory applied to an impulsive system, that a phase space can be generated describing the continuous separation of system equilibria. Mapping process performance data onto these spaces allows engineers to target suitable operating regimes for specific objectives. Here, for example, we note that the nitrogen removal efficiency is maximised close to the trans-critical bifurcation curve denoting nitrite oxidising bacteria washout, but control of solids washout and Anammox biofilm activity can also reduce oxygen requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate Hydraulic Retention Time. The approach taken is significant given the possibility for using such a methodology for models of increasing complexity, which will enable engineers to probe the entire parameter space of systems of higher dimensionality and realism in a consistent manner.",

    "abstract": "Axon guidance is a critical process in forming the connections between a neuron and its target. The growth cone steers the growing axon towards the appropriate direction by integrating extracellular guidance cues and initiating intracellular signal transduction pathways downstream of these cues. The growth cone generates these responses by remodeling its cytoskeletal components. Regulation of microtubule dynamics within the growth cone is important for making guidance decisions. TACC3, as a microtubule plus-end binding protein, modulates microtubule dynamics during axon outgrowth and guidance. We have previously shown that embryos depleted of TACC3 displayed spinal cord axon guidance defects, while TACC3-overexpressing spinal neurons showed increased resistance to Slit2-induced growth cone collapse. Here, in order to investigate the mechanism behind TACC3-mediated axon guidance, we studied the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation induced by Abelson tyrosine kinase. We find that the phosphorylatable tyrosines within the TACC domain are important for the microtubule plus-end tracking behavior of TACC3. Moreover, TACC domain phosphorylation impacts axon outgrowth and guidance, and it also regulates microtubule extension into the growth cone periphery. Together, our results suggest that phosphorylation of TACC3 is a key regulatory mechanism by which TACC3 controls axon outgrowth and pathfinding decisions of neurons during embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 infection is frequently associated with low bone density, which can progress to osteoporosis leading to a high risk of fractures. Only a few mechanisms have been proposed to explain the enhanced osteolysis in the context of HIV-1 infection. As macrophages are involved in bone homeostasis and are critical cell hosts for HIV-1, we asked whether HIV-1-infected macrophages could participate in bone degradation. Upon infection, human macrophages acquired some osteoclast features: they became multinucleated, upregulated the osteoclast markers RhoE and {beta}3 integrin, and organized their podosomes as ring superstructures resembling osteoclast sealing zones. However, HIV-1 infected macrophages were not fully differentiated in osteoclasts as they did not upregulate NFATc-1 transcription factor and were unable to degrade bone. Investigating whether infected macrophages participate indirectly to virus-induced osteolysis, we showed that they produce RANKL, the key osteoclastogenic cytokine. RANK-L secreted by HIV-1-infected macrophages was not sufficient to stimulate multinucleation, but promoted the protease-dependent migration of osteoclast precursors. In conclusion, we propose that, by stimulating RANKL secretion, HIV-1-infected macrophages contribute to create a microenvironment that favors the recruitment of osteoclasts, participating to bone disorders observed in HIV-1+ patients.",

    "abstract": "Beyond the haploid genome, mammalian sperm contribute a payload of epigenetic information which can modulate offspring phenotypes. Recent studies have shown that the small RNA payload of sperm undergoes extensive remodeling during post-testicular maturation in the epididymis. Intriguingly, epididymal maturation has also been linked to changes in the sperm methylome, suggesting that the epididymis might play a broader role in remodeling the sperm epigenome. Here, we build on prior studies of the maturing sperm methylation landscape, further characterizing the genome-wide methylation landscape in seven germ cell populations collected from throughout the male reproductive tract. Overall, we find very few changes in the cytosine methylation landscape between testicular germ cell populations and cauda epididymal sperm, demonstrating that the sperm methylome is largely stable throughout post-testicular maturation. Intriguingly, although our sequencing data suggested that caput epididymal sperm exhibit a highly unusual methylome, follow-up studies revealed that this resulted from contamination of caput sperm by extracellular DNA. Extracellular DNA formed web-like structures that ensnared sperm, was present only in the caput epididymis of virgin males, where it was associated with citrullinated histone H3 and presumably resulted from a PAD-driven genome decondensation process. Taken together, our data emphasize the stability of the cytosine methylation landscape in mammalian sperm, and identify a surprising but transient period during which immature sperm are associated with extracellular DNA.",

    "abstract": "Cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) are majestic carnivores and the fastest land animals; yet, they are quickly heading towards an uncertain future. Threatened by habitat loss, human-interactions and illegal trafficking, there are only approximately 7,100 individuals remaining in the wild. Cheetahs used to roam large parts of Africa, and Western and Southern Asia. Today they are confined to about 9% of their original distribution. To investigate their genetic diversity and conservation status, we generated genome-wide data from historical and modern samples of all four currently recognized subspecies, along with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and major histo-compatibility complex (MHC) data. We found clear genetic differentiation between the sub-species, thus refuting earlier assumptions that cheetahs show only little population differentiation. Our genome-wide nuclear data indicate that cheetahs from East Africa may be more closely related to A. j. soemmeringii than they are to A. j. jubatus. This supports the need for further research on the classification of cheetah subspecies, as East African cheetahs are currently included in the Southern Africa subspecies, A. j. jubatus. We detected stronger inbreeding in individuals of the Critically Endangered A. j. venaticus (Iran) and A. j. hecki (Northwest Africa), and show that overall genome-wide heterozygosity in cheetah is lower than that reported for other threatened and endangered felids, such as tigers and lions. Furthermore, we show that MHC class II diversity in cheetahs is generally higher than previously reported, but still lower than in other felids. Our results provide new and important information for efficient genetic monitoring, subspecies assignments and evidence-based conservation policy decisions.",

We grew ancestors and descendants from northern-edge, central, and southern-edge populations across eight temperatures. Despite recent climate anomalies, populations showed limited evolution of thermal performance curves. However, one southern population evolved a narrower thermal performance breadth by 1.25 {degrees}C, which matches the direction and magnitude of the average decrease in seasonality experienced. Consistent with the climate variability hypothesis, thermal performance breadth increased with temperature seasonality across the species geographic range. Inconsistent with performance trade-offs between low and high temperatures across populations, we did not detect a positive relationship between thermal optimum and mean temperature. These findings fail to support the hypothesis that evolutionary response to climate change is greatest at the leading edge, and suggest that the evolution of thermal performance is unlikely to rescue most populations from the detrimental effects of rapidly changing climate.",

    "abstract": "Tissue resident memory CD8 T (TRM) cells are a unique immune memory subset that develops and remains in peripheral tissues at the site of infection, providing future host resistance upon re-exposure to that pathogen. In the pulmonary system, TRM are identified through S1P antagonist CD69 and expression of integrins CD103/{beta}7 and CD49a/CD29({beta}1). Contrary to the established role of CD69 on CD8 T cells, the functions of CD103 and CD49a on this population are not well defined. This study examines the expression patterns and functions of CD103 and CD49a with a specific focus on their impact on T cell motility during influenza virus infection. We show that the TRM cell surface phenotype develops by two-weeks post-infection and that each integrin contributes a distinct function regulating CD8 T cell motility both in vitro and in vivo, with CD49a facilitating migration and CD103 limiting motility through tethering. These results demonstrate for the first time how CD103 and CD49a differentially impact adherence and migration in the tissue, likely affecting overall retention, maintenance of TRM, and host protection.\n\nSignificance StatementCurrent influenza vaccination strategies require annual immunizations, with fairly low efficacy rates. One technique to improve protection against a greater breadth of influenza viruses is to elicit broadly cross-reactive cell-mediated immunity and generate a local population of cytotoxic T cells to respond to conserved regions of circulating viruses. However, this approach requires improved understanding of how these cells migrate within and attach to the tissue, in order to persist and offer long-term immunity. This study investigates how receptors on the T cell surface impact the cells ability to interact with the tissue and provide evidence for which of these receptors are essential for protection. Furthermore, these studies reveal functional in vivo mechanisms of cellular markers used to characterize TRM.",

    "abstract": "The misfolding and aggregation of proteins is often implicated in the development and progression of degenerative diseases. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), such as the ubiquitously expressed Type II Hsp40 molecular chaperone, DNAJB6, assist in protein folding and disaggregation. Historically, mutations within the DNAJB6 G/F domain have been associated with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy type 1D, now referred to as LGMDD1, a dominantly inherited degenerative disease. Recently, novel mutations within the J domain of DNAJB6 have been reported in patients with LGMDD1. Since novel myopathy-causing mutations in the Hsp40 J domain have yet to be characterized and both the function of DNAJB6 in skeletal muscle and the clients of this chaperone are unknown, we set out to assess the effect of these mutations on chaperone function using the genetically tractable yeast system. The essential yeast Type II Hsp40, Sis1, is homologous to DNAJB6 and is involved in the propagation of yeast prions. Using phenotypic, biochemical, and functional assays we found that homologous mutations in the Sis1 J domain differentially alter the processing of specific yeast prion strains, as well as a non-prion substrate. These data suggest that the newly-identified mutations in the J domain of DNAJB6 cause aberrant chaperone function that leads to the pathogenesis in LGMDD1.",

Most known biomolecular condensates are sphere-like, but TIS granules have a mesh-like morphology. Through in vivo and in vitro reconstitution experiments we discovered that this shape is generated by extensive intermolecular RNA-RNA interactions. They are mostly accomplished by mRNAs with large unstructured regions in their 3'UTRs that we call intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). As AU-rich RNA is a potent chaperone that suppresses protein aggregation and is overrepresented in mRNAs with IDRs, our data suggests that TIS granules concentrate mRNAs that assist protein folding. In addition, the proximity of translating mRNAs in TIS granule networks may enable co-translational protein complex formation.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism underlying the geometrical patterning of axon and dendrite wiring remains elusive, despite its critical importance in the formation of functional neural circuits. Cerebellar Purkinje cell (PC) arborizes a typical planar dendrite, which forms an orthogonal network with granule cell (GC) axons. By using electrospun nanofiber substrates, we reproduce the perpendicular contacts between PC dendrites and GC axons in culture. In the model system, PC dendrites show preference to grow perpendicular to aligned GC axons, which presumably contribute to the planar dendrite arborization in vivo. We show that {beta}III spectrin, a causal gene for spinocerebellar ataxia type 5 (SCA5), is required for the biased growth of dendrites. {beta}III spectrin deficiency causes actin mislocalization and excessive microtubule invasion in dendritic protrusions, resulting in abnormally oriented branch formation. Furthermore, disease-associated mutations affect the ability of {beta}III spectrin to control dendrite orientation. These data indicate that {beta}III spectrin organizes the dendritic cytoskeleton and thereby regulates the oriented growth of dendrites with respect to the afferent axons.\n\nSummary statement{beta}III spectrin suppress the microtubule dynamics at the neuronal dendrite to inhibit the abnormal lateral branching, which causes misoriented branch formation.",

To reach the fullest potential, however, this approach requires further development in many aspects, a key one being regulating the community composition. Here we leverage well established mechanisms in ecology which govern the relative abundance of multi-species ecosystems and develop a new tool for programming the composition of synthetic microbial communities. Using a simple model system consisting of two microorganisms Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida, which occupy different but partially overlapping thermal niches, we demonstrate that temperature regulation can be used to enable coexistence and program the community composition. We first investigate a constant temperature regime and show that different temperatures lead to different community compositions. Next, we invent a new cycling temperature regime and show that it can dynamically tune the microbial community, achieving a wide range of compositions depending on parameters that are readily manipulatable. Our work provides conclusive proof of concept that temperature regulation is a versatile and powerful tool capable of programming compositions of synthetic microbial communities.",

Attention is both influenced through bottom-up stimulus properties as well as top-down task demands. The interaction of these two attention mechanisms is not yet fully understood.

We propose a recurrent generative neural network model that predicts a visual scene based on foveated glimpses. The model shifts its attention in order to minimize the uncertainty in its predictions. We show that the proposed model produces naturalistic eye movements focusing on informative stimulus regions.

While some experiments show a role of the ophthalmic nerve in magnetic sensing, others show that effects of light on processes in the retina are involved. According to these inconclusive and puzzling findings, the scientific community has yet to reach an agreement concerning the underlying mechanism behind animal magnetic sensing. Recently, the symbiotic magnetotaxis hypothesis has been forwarded as a mechanistic explanation for the phenomenon of animal magnetoreception. It suggests a symbiotic relationship between magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) and the navigating host. Here we show that in contrast to the control group, antibiotic treatment caused a lack of clear directionality in an Emlen funnel experiment. Accordingly, the antibiotics treatment group showed a significant increase in directional variance.

Expansion and contraction of these repeats can strongly impact protein function as was shown for KNL1 and PRDM9. However, these known cases could only be identified manually and were previously incorrectly reported as conserved in large-scale analyses, because signatures of repeat evolution are difficult to resolve automatically.\n\nWe developed PhyRepID to compare protein domain repeat evolution and analysed 4939 groups of orthologous proteins (OGs) from 14 vertebrate species. Our main contributions are 1) detecting a wide scope of repeats consisting of Pfam structural domains and motifs, 2) improving sensitivity and precision of repeat unit detection through optimization for the OGs, 3) using phylogenetic analysis to detect evolution within repeat regions. From these phylogenetic signals, we derived a \"protein repeat duplication\" (PRD) score that quantifies evolution in repeat regions and thereby enables large-scale comparison of protein families. Zinc finger repeats show remarkably fast evolution, comprising 25 of 100 fastest evolving proteins in our dataset, whilst cooperatively-folding domain repeats like beta-propellers are mostly conserved. Motif repeats have a similar PRD score distribution as domain repeats and also show a large diversity in evolutionary rates. A ranking based on the PRD score reflects previous manual observations of both highly conserved (CDC20) and rapidly evolving repeats (KNL1, PRDM9) and proposes novel candidates (e.g. AHNAK, PRX, SPATA31) showing previously undescribed rapid repeat evolution.

    "abstract": "Previous studies from our laboratory established that pUL16 and pUL21 are required for efficient nuclear egress of herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2) capsids. To better understand the role of these proteins in nuclear egress, we wished to establish whether nuclear egress complex (NEC) localization and/or function was altered in the absence of either pUL16 or pUL21. We used antiserum raised against HSV-2 NEC components pUL31 and pUL34 to examine NEC localization by immunofluorescence microscopy. NEC localization in cells infected with pUL16 deficient viruses was indistinguishable from that observed in cells infected with wild type viruses. By contrast, NEC localization was found to be aberrant in cells infected with pUL21 deficient virus and, instead, showed some similarity to the aberrant NEC localization pattern observed in cells infected with pUs3 deficient virus. These results indicated that pUL16 plays a role in nuclear egress that is distinct from that of pUL21 and pUs3. Higher resolution examination of nuclear envelope ultrastructure in cells infected with pUL21 deficient viruses by transmission electron microscopy showed different types of nuclear envelope perturbations, including some that were not observed in cells infected with pUs3 deficient virus. The formation of the nuclear envelope perturbations observed in pUL21 deficient virus infections was found to be dependent on a functional NEC, revealing a novel role for pUL21 in regulating NEC activity. The results of comparisons of nuclear envelope ultrastructure in cells infected with viruses lacking pUs3, pUL16 or both pUs3 and pUL16 were consistent with a role for pUL16 upstream of primary capsid envelopment and shed new light on how pUs3 functions in nuclear egress.\n\nAuthor summaryThe membrane deformation activity of the herpesvirus nuclear egress complex (NEC), allows viral capsids to transit from their site of assembly in the nucleus through both nuclear membranes into the cytoplasm. The timing, extent and directionality of NEC activity must be precisely controlled during viral infection, yet our knowledge of how NEC activity is controlled is incomplete. To determine how pUL16 and pUL21, two viral proteins required for nuclear egress of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) capsids, function to promote nuclear egress, we examined how the lack of each protein impacted NEC localization. These analyses revealed a function of pUL16 in nuclear egress that is distinct from that of pUL21, uncovered a novel role for pUL21 in regulating NEC activity and shed new light on how a viral kinase, pUs3, regulates nuclear egress. Nuclear egress of viral capsids is a common feature of the replicative cycle of all herpesviruses. A complete understanding of all aspects of nuclear egress, including how viral NEC activity is controlled, may yield strategies to disrupt this process that could be applied to the development of herpes-specific antiviral drugs.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between genetic variants - epistasis - is pervasive in model systems and can profoundly impact evolutionary adaption, population disease dynamics, genetic mapping, and precision medicine efforts. In this work we develop a model for structured polygenic epistasis, called Coordinated Interaction (CI), and prove that several recent theories of genetic architecture fall under the formal umbrella of CI. Unlike standard polygenic epistasis models that assume interaction and main effects are independent, in the CI model, sets of SNPs broadly interact positively or negatively, on balance skewing the penetrance of main genetic effects. To test for the existence of CI we propose the even-odd (EO) test and prove it is calibrated in a range of realistic biological models. Applying the EO test in the UK Biobank, we find evidence of CI in 14 of 26 traits spanning disease, anthropometric, and blood categories. Finally, we extend the EO test to tissue-specific enrichment and identify several plausible tissue-trait pairs. Overall, CI is a new dimension of genetic architecture that can capture structured, systemic interactions in complex human traits.",

WMNE was calculated from reconstructed cerebral white matter networks for each individual. Mixed linear effects models were estimated to investigate the association of higher resilience to cognitive decline with higher WMNE and the modulation of this association by increased cerebral amyloid, CSF tau or WMHV. For the majority of cognitive outcome measures, higher WMNE was associated with higher resilience to cognitive decline independently of pathology measures (beta: .074 - .098; p: .011 - .039). Additionally, WMNE was consistently associated with higher resilience to cognitive decline in subjects with higher cerebral amyloid burden (beta: .024 - .276; p: .000 - .036) and with lower CSF tau (beta: -.030 - -.074; p: .015 - .002) across all cognitive outcome measures.

Resistance to chemistries used in these programs is now widespread and represents a significant threat to the gains seen in reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality. Recently, disruption of the 20-hydroxyecdysone steroid hormone pathway was shown to reduce Plasmodium development time and significantly reduce both longevity and egg production in a laboratory susceptible Anopheles gambiae population. Here, we demonstrate that disruption of this pathway by application of methoxyfenozide (MET) to insecticide resistant An. coluzzii, An. gambiae sl and An. funestus populations significantly reduces egg production in both topical and tarsal application. Moreover, MET reduces adult longevity when applied topically, and tarsally after blood feeding. As the cytochrome p450s elevated in pyrethroid resistant Anopheles only bind MET very weakly, this compound is unlikely to be subject to cross-resistance in a field-based setting. Manipulation of this hormonal signalling pathway therefore represents a potential complementary approach to current malaria control strategies, particularly in areas where high levels of insecticide resistance are compromising existing tools.",

    "abstract": "The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) complex comprises seven phylogenetically distinct human-adapted lineages exhibiting different geographical distribution and degrees of pathogenicity. Among these, Lineage 1 (L1) has been associated with low virulence whereas Lineage 2 (L2) has been linked to hyper-virulence, enhanced transmission and drug resistance. Here, we conducted multi-layer comparative analyses using whole genome sequencing data combined with quantitative transcriptomic and proteomic profiling of a set of L1 and L2 clinical strains, each grown under two different conditions in vitro. Our data revealed different degrees of correlation between transcript and protein abundances across clinical strains and functional gene categories, indicating variable levels of post-transcriptional regulation in the tested lineages. Contrasting genomic and gene expression data showed that the magnitude of the transcriptional and translational changes was proportional to the phylogenetic distance between strains, with one out of three single nucleotide polymorphisms leading to a transcriptional and/or translational change on average. We devised a new genome-scale transcriptional regulatory model and identified several master transcription factors, strongly linked to the sigma factor network, whose targets were differentially regulated between the two lineages. These differences resulted in a higher basal expression of DosR proteins and a stronger response to nitric oxide (NO) exposure in L2 compared to L1. These patterns are most likely responsible for the shorter NO-induced growth arrest in L2 observed. Given the limited genetic variation between strains, it appears that phenotypic differences in Mtb are substantially driven by differences in the regulation of biochemical networks through master transcriptional regulators.\n\nHighlightsO_LIProteomic and transcriptomic characterization of fully sequenced diverse L1 and L2 clinical isolates of Mtb.\nC_LIO_LIPost-transcriptional control mechanisms for regulatory and virulence genes are mitigated in Mtb L2.\nC_LIO_LIBy applying a genome-scale transcriptional framework, DosR, Rv1985c, Lsr2 and Rv0691c are identified as master transcription factors responsible for differential target gene expression in L2 strains compared to L1.\nC_LIO_LIL1 and L2 DosR proteins respond differently to nitric oxide stress, thus determining a relevant phenotype.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "IntroductionHormones signal through various receptors and cascades of biochemical reactions to expand beta cell mass during pregnancy. Harnessing this phenomenon to treat beta cell dysfunction requires quantitative understanding of the signaling at the molecular level. This study explores how different regulatory elements impact JAK-STAT signaling through the prolactin receptor in pancreatic beta cells.\n\nMethodsA mechanistic computational model was constructed to describe the key reactions and molecular species involved in JAK-STAT signaling in response to the hormone prolactin. The effect of including and excluding different regulatory modules in the model structure was explored through ensemble modeling. A Bayesian approach for likelihood estimation was used to parametrize the model to experimental data from the literature.\n\nResultsReceptor upregulation, combined with either inhibition by SOCS proteins, receptor internalization, or both, was required to obtain STAT5 dynamics matching experimental results for INS-1 cells treated with prolactin. Multiple model structures could fit the experimental data, and key findings were conserved across model structures, including faster dimerization and nuclear import rates of STAT5B compared to STAT5A. The model was validated using experimental data from rat primary beta cells not used in parameter estimation. Probing the fitted, validated model revealed possible strategies to modulate STAT5 signaling.\n\nConclusionsJAK-STAT signaling must be tightly controlled to obtain the biphasic response in STAT5 activation seen experimentally. Receptor up-regulation, combined with SOCS inhibition, receptor internalization, or both is required to match experimental data. Modulating reactions upstream in the signaling can enhance STAT5 activation to increase beta cell mass.",

    "abstract": "The human diseases caused by the fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii are associated with high indices of mortality, and toxic and/or cost-prohibitive therapeutic protocols. The need for affordable antifungals to combat cryptococcal disease is unquestionable. Previous studies suggested benzimidazoles as promising anti-cryptococcal agents combining low cost and high antifungal efficacy, but their therapeutic potential has not been demonstrated so far. In this study, we investigated the antifungal potential of fenbendazole, the most effective anti-cryptococcal benzimidazole. Fenbendazole was inhibitory against 30 different isolates of C. neoformans and C. gattii at a low concentration. The mechanism of anti-cryptococcal activity of fenbendazole involved microtubule disorganization, as previously described for human parasites. In combination with fenbendazole, the concentrations of the standard antifungal amphotericin B required to control cryptococcal growth were lower than those required when this antifungal was used alone. Fenbendazole was not toxic to mammalian cells. During macrophage infection, the anti-cryptococcal effects of fenbendazole included inhibition of intracellular proliferation rates and reduced phagocytic escape through vomocytosis. Fenbendazole deeply affected the cryptococcal capsule. In a mice model of cryptococcosis, the efficacy of fenbendazole to control animal mortality was similar to that observed for amphotericin B. These results indicate that fenbendazole is a promising candidate for the future development of an efficient and affordable therapeutic tool to combat cryptococcosis.",

Screening for protein interaction partners of the previously characterized polar growth factors RgsP and RgsM, we identified the inner membrane components of the Tol-Pal system (TolQ and TolR) and novel Rgs (rhizobial growth and septation) proteins with unknown functions. TolQ, Pal and all Rgs proteins, except for RgsE, were indispensable for S. meliloti cell growth. Six of the Rgs proteins, TolQ and Pal localized to the growing cell pole in the cell elongation phase and to the septum in pre-divisional cells, and three Rgs proteins localized to growing cell pole only. The FtsN-like protein RgsS contains a conserved SPOR domain and is indispensable at the early stages of cell division. The components of the Tol-Pal system were required at the late stages of cell division. RgsE, a homolog of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens growth pole ring protein GPR, has an important role in maintaining the normal growth rate and rod cell shape. RgsD is a novel periplasmic protein with the ability to bind peptidoglycan. Analysis of the phylogenetic distribution of novel Rgs proteins showed that they are conserved in Rhizobiales and mostly absent from other -proteobacterial orders, suggesting a conserved role of these proteins in polar growth.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacterial cell proliferation involves cell growth and septum formation followed by cell division. For cell growth, bacteria have evolved different complex mechanisms. The most prevalent growth mode of rod shaped bacteria is cell elongation by incorporating new peptidoglycan in a dispersed manner along the sidewall. A small share of rod-shaped bacteria, including the -proteobacterial Rhizobiales, grow unipolarly. Here, we identified and initially characterized a set of Rgs (rhizobial growth and septation) proteins, which are involved in cell division and unipolar growth of Sinorhizobium meliloti and highly conserved in Rhizobiales. Our data expand the knowledge of components of the polarly localized machinery driving cell wall growth and suggest a complex of Rgs proteins with components of the divisome, differing in composition between the polar cell elongation zone and the septum.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe emergence and spread of tick-borne arboviruses pose an increased challenge to human and animal health. In Europe this is demonstrated by the increasingly wide distribution of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV, Flavivirus, Flaviviridae), which has recently been found in the UK. However, much less is known about other tick-borne flaviviruses (TBFV), such as the closely related louping ill virus (LIV), an animal pathogen which is endemic to the UK and Ireland but which has been detected in other parts of Europe including Scandinavia and Russia. The emergence and potential spatial overlap of these viruses necessitates improved understanding of LIV genomic diversity, geographic spread and evolutionary history.\n\nMethodology/principal findingsWe sequenced a virus archive composed of 22 LIV isolates which had been sampled throughout the UK over a period of over 80 years. Combining this dataset with published virus sequences, we detected no sign of recombination and found low diversity and limited evidence for positive selection in the LIV genome. Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of geographic clustering as well as long-distance movement, including movement events that appear recent. However, despite genomic data and an 80-year time span, we found that the data contained insufficient temporal signal to reliably estimate a molecular clock rate for LIV. Additional analyses revealed that this also applied to TBEV, albeit to a lesser extent, pointing to a general problem with phylogenetic dating for TBFV.\n\nConclusions/significanceThe 22 LIV genomes generated during this study provide a more reliable LIV phylogeny, improving our knowledge of the evolution of tick-borne flaviviruses. Our inability to estimate a molecular clock rate for both LIV and TBEV suggests that temporal calibration of tick-borne flavivirus evolution should be interpreted with caution and highlight a unique aspect of these viruses which may be explained by their reliance on tick vectors.\n\nAuthor SummaryTick-borne pathogens represent a major emerging threat to public health and in recent years have been expanding into new areas. LIV is a neglected virus endemic to the UK and Ireland (though it has been detected in Scandinavia and Russia) which is closely related to the major human pathogen TBEV, but predominantly causes disease in sheep and grouse. The recent detection of TBEV in the UK, which has also emerged elsewhere in Europe, requires more detailed understanding of the spread and sequence diversity of LIV. This could be important for diagnosis and vaccination, but also to improve our understanding of the evolution and emergence of these tick-borne viruses. Here we describe the sequencing of 22 LIV isolates which have been sampled from several host species across the past century. We have utilised this dataset to investigate the evolutionary pressures that LIV is subjected to and have explored the evolution of LIV using phylogenetic analysis. Crucially we were unable to estimate a reliable molecular clock rate for LIV and found that this problem also extends to a larger phylogeny of TBEV sequences. This work highlights a previously unknown caveat of tick-borne flavivirus evolutionary analysis which may be important for understanding the evolution of these important pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The quest for genome-wide signatures of selection in populations using SNP data has proven efficient to uncover genes involved in conserved or adaptive molecular functions, but none of the statistical methods were designed to identify interacting genes as targets of selective processes. Here, we propose a straightforward statistical test aimed at detecting epistatic selection, based on a linkage disequilibrium (LD) measure accounting for population structure and heterogeneous relatedness between individuals. SNP-based (Trv) and window-based (TcorPC1v) statistics fit a Student distribution, allowing to easily and quickly test the significance of correlation coefficients in the frame of Genome-Wide Epistatic Selection Scans (GWESS) using candidate genes as baits. As a proof of concept, use of SNP data from the Medicago truncatula symbiotic legume plant uncovered a previously unknown gene coadaptation between the MtSUNN (Super Numeric Nodule) receptor and the MtCLE02 (CLAVATA3-Like) signalling peptide, and experimental evidence accordingly supported a MtSUNN-dependent negative role of MtCLE02 in symbiotic root nodulation. Using human HGDP-CEPH SNP data, our new statistical test uncovered strong LD between SLC24A5 and EDAR worldwide, which persists after correction for population structure and relatedness in Central South Asian populations. This result suggests adaptive genetic interaction or coselection between skin pigmentation and the ectodysplasin pathway involved in the development of ectodermal organs (hairs, teeth, sweat glands), in some human populations. Applying this approach to genome-wide SNP data will foster the identification of evolutionary coadapted gene networks.\n\nAuthor summaryPopulation genomic methods have allowed to identify many genes associated with adaptive processes in populations with complex histories. However, they are not designed to identify gene coadaptation between genes through epistatic selection, in structured populations. To tackle this problem, we developed a straightforward LD-based statistical test accounting for population structure and heterogeneous relatedness between individuals, using SNP-based (Trv) or windows-based (TcorPC1v) statistics. This allows easily and quickly testing for significance of correlation coefficients between polymorphic loci in the frame of Genome Wide Epistatic Selection Scans (GWESS). Following detection of gene coadaptation using SNP data from human and the model plant Medicago truncatula, we report experimental evidence of genetic interaction between two receptors involved in the regulation of root nodule symbiosis in Medicago truncatula. This test opens new avenues for exploring the evolution of genes as interacting units and thus paves the way to infer new networks based on evolutionary coadaptation between genes.",

    "abstract": "While interacting with objects during every-day activities, e.g. when sliding a glass on a counter top, people obtain constant feedback whether they are acting in accordance with physical laws. However, classical research on intuitive physics has revealed that peoples judgements systematically deviate from predictions of Newtonian physics. Recent research has explained these deviations not as consequence of misconceptions about physics but instead as the consequence of the probabilistic interaction between inevitable perceptual uncertainties and prior beliefs. How intuitive physical reasoning relates to visuomotor actions is much less known. Here, we present an experiment in which participants had to slide pucks under the influence of naturalistic friction in a simulated virtual environment. The puck was controlled by the duration of a button press, which needed to be scaled linearly with the pucks mass and with the square-root of initial distance to reach a target. Over four phases of the experiment, uncertainties were manipulated by altering the availability of sensory feedback and providing different degrees of knowledge about the physical properties of pucks. A hierarchical Bayesian model of the visuomotor sliding task incorporating perceptual uncertainty and press-time variability found substantial evidence that subjects adjusted their button-presses so that the sliding was in accordance with Newtonian physics. After observing collisions between pucks, subjects transferred the relative masses inferred perceptually to adjust subsequent sliding actions. Crucial in the modeling was the inclusion of a cost function, which quantitatively captures participants implicit sensitivity to errors due to their motor variability. Taken together, in the present experiment we find evidence that our participants transferred their intuitive physical reasoning to a subsequent visuomotor control task in accordance with Newtonian physics and weigh potential outcomes with cost functions based on their knowledge about their own variability.\n\nAuthor summaryDuring our daily lives we interact with objects around us governed by Newtonian physics. While people are known to show multiple systematic errors when reasoning about Newtonian physics, recent research has provided evidence that this is the consequence of perceptual uncertainties and partial knowledge about object properties. Here, we carried out an experiment to investigate whether people transfer their intuitive physical reasoning to how they interact with objects. Using a simulated virtual environment in which participants had to slide different pucks into a target region by the length of a button press, we found evidence that they could do so in accordance with the underlying physical laws. Moreover, our participants watched movies of colliding pucks and subsequently transferred their beliefs about the relative masses of the observed pucks to the sliding task. Remarkably, this transfer was consistent with Newtonian physics and could well be explained by a computational model that takes participants perceptual uncertainty, action variability, and preferences into account.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are complex biomolecules which perform critical tasks in living organisms. Knowledge of a proteins structure is essential for understanding its physiological function in detail. Despite the incredible progress in experimental techniques, protein structure determination is still expensive, time-consuming, and arduous. That is why computer simulations are often used to complement or interpret experimental data. Here, we explore how in silico protein structure determination based on replica exchange molecular dynamics can benefit from including contact information derived from theoretical and experimental sources, such as direct coupling analysis or NMR spectroscopy. To reflect the influence from erroneous and noisy data we probe how false-positive contacts influence the simulated ensemble. Specifically, we integrate varying numbers of randomly selected native and non-native contacts and explore how such a bias can guide simulations towards the native state. We investigate the number of contacts needed for a significant enrichment of native-like conformations and show the capabilities and limitations of this method. Adhering to a threshold of approximately 75% true-positive contacts within a simulation, we obtain an ensemble with native-like conformations of high quality. We find that contact-guided REX MD is capable of delivering physically reasonable models of a proteins structure.\n\nAuthor summaryProtein structure prediction, that is obtaining a protein structure starting from a sequence using any computational method, is a great challenge. Over the past years a broad variety of methods evolved, ranging from algorithms for \"blind\" or de novo predictions using Monte-Carlo or physics-based biomolecular simulation methods to algorithms transferring structure information obtained from known homologous proteins. Recently, purely data-driven approaches using neural networks have shown to be capable of predicting high-quality structures. However, some local structural motifs are only poorly resolved and need further refinement. Here, we explore to what extent contact information helps guiding replica exchange molecular dynamics towards the native fold. By adding a contact pair bias potential to the energy function, we effectively guide the search towards the target structure by narrowing the conformational space to be sampled. We find that such an energetic bias, even if containing false-positive contacts to a certain extent, greatly enhances the refinement process and improves the chance of finding the native state in a single run.",

    "abstract": "Calcium oscillations and waves are often behind instances of extra depolarization in cardiac cells, eventually giving rise to life-threatening arrhythmias. In this work, we study the conditions for the appearance of calcium oscillations in both a detailed subcellular model of calcium dynamics and a minimal model that takes into account just the minimal ingredients of the calcium toolkit. To avoid the effects of homeostatic changes and the interaction with the action potential we consider the somewhat artificial condition of a cell without pacing and with no calcium exchange with the extracellular medium. This permits us to isolate the main reasons responsible for the oscillations by controlling externally the total calcium content of the cell. We find that as the calcium content is increased, the system transitions between two stationary states, corresponding to one with closed ryanodine receptors (RyR) and most calcium in the cell stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and another, with open RyRs and a depleted SR. In between these states, calcium oscillations may appear. This transition depends very sensitively in the amount of buffering in the cell. We find, for instance, that at high values of calsequestrin (CSQ) oscillations disappear, while they are present for a broad range of parameters at low values of CSQ. Using the minimal model, we can relate the stability of the oscillating state to the nullcline structure of the system, and find that its range of existence is bounded by a homoclinic and a Hopf bifurcation.\n\nAuthor summaryIn cardiac cells, calcium plays a very important role. An increase in calcium levels is the trigger used by the cell to initiate contraction. Besides, calcium modulates several transmembrane currents, affecting the cell transmembrane potential. Thus, dysregulations in calcium handling have been associated with the appearance of arrhythmias. Often, this dysregulation results in the appearance of periodic calcium waves or global oscillations, providing a pro-arrhythmic substrate. In this paper, we study the onset of calcium oscillations in cardiac cells using both a detailed subcellular model of calcium dynamics and a minimal model that takes into account just the minimal ingredients of the calcium toolkit. Both reproduce the main experimental results and link this behavior with the presence of different steady-state solutions and bifurcations that depend on the total amount of calcium in the cell and in the level of buffering present. We expect that this work will help to clarify the conditions under which calcium oscillations appear in cardiac myocytes and, therefore, will represent a step further in the understanding of the origin of cardiac arrhythmias.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral cortical size and organization are critical features of neurodevelopment and human evolution, for which genetic investigation in model organisms can provide insight into developmental mechanisms and the causes of cerebral malformations. However, some abnormalities in cerebral cortical proliferation and folding are challenging to study in laboratory mice due to the absence of gyri and sulci in rodents. We report an autosomal recessive allele in domestic cats associated with impaired cerebral cortical expansion and folding, giving rise to a smooth, lissencephalic brain, and that appears to be caused by homozygosity for a frameshift in PEA15 (phosphoprotein expressed in astrocytes-15). Notably, previous studies of a Pea15 targeted mutation in mice did not reveal structural brain abnormalities. Affected cats, however, present with a non-progressive hypermetric gait and tremors, develop dissociative behavioral defects and aggression with age, and exhibit profound malformation of the cerebrum, with a 45% average decrease in overall brain weight, and reduction or absence of the ectosylvian, sylvian and anterior cingulate gyrus. Histologically, the cerebral cortical layers are disorganized, there is substantial loss of white matter in tracts such as the corona radiata and internal capsule, but the cerebellum is relatively spared. RNA-seq and immunohistochemical analysis reveal astrocytosis. Fibroblasts cultured from affected cats exhibit increased TNF-mediated apoptosis, and increased FGFb-induced proliferation, consistent with previous studies implicating PEA15 as an intracellular adapter protein, and suggesting an underlying pathophysiology in which increased death of neurons accompanied by increased proliferation of astrocytes gives rise to abnormal organization of neuronal layers and loss of white matter. Taken together, our work points to a new role for PEA15 in development of a complex cerebral cortex that is only apparent in gyrencephalic species.\n\nSummaryGyrification is the neurodevelopmental process in certain mammalian species during which the cerebral cortex expands and folds resulting in the classic wrinkled appearance of the brain. Abnormalities in this process underlie many congenital malformations of the brain. However, unlike many other human malformations, genetic insight into gyrification is not possible in laboratory mice because rodents have a lissencephalic or smooth cerebral cortex. We identified a mutation in domestic cats that likely causes failure of the cerebral cortex to expand and fold properly, and discovered that the mutation impairs production of a protein, PEA15 (phosphoprotein expressed in astrocytes-15), involved in intracellular signaling. Affected cats have profound abnormalities in brain development, with minimal changes in their superficial behavior and neurologic function. Additional studies of tissue and cultured cells from affected animals suggest a pathophysiologic mechanism in which increased death of neurons accompanied by increased cell division of astrocytes gives rise to abnormal organization of neuronal layers and loss of white matter. These results provide new insight into a developmental process that is unique to animals with gyrencephalic brains.",

A major challenge is to now determine which of these variants contribute to diseases as a result of their effect on gene function. Here we describe a generic approach using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to quickly develop gene-specific in vivo assays that can be used to quantify the level of function of a genetic variant. Using Synthetic Dosage Lethality screening, \"sentinel\" yeast strains are identified that are sensitive to overexpression of a human disease gene. Variants of the gene can then be functionalized in high-throughput fashion through simple growth assays using either solid or liquid media.

    "abstract": "The morphology and physiology of the oogenesis have been well studied in the vector of Chagas disease Rhodnius prolixus. However, the molecular interactions that regulate the process of egg formation, key for the reproductive cycle of the vector, is still largely unknown. In order to understand the molecular and cellular basis of the oogenesis we examined the function of the gene Bicaudal C (BicC) during oogenesis and early development of R. prolixus. We show that R. prolixus BicC (Rp-BicC) gene is expressed in the germarium, with cytoplasmic distribution, as well as in the follicular epithelium of the developing oocytes. RNAi silencing of Rp-BicC resulted in sterile females that lay few, small, non-viable eggs. The ovaries are reduced in size and show a disarray of the follicular epithelium. This indicates that Rp-BicC has a central role in the regulation of oogenesis. Although the follicular cells are able to form the chorion, the uptake of vitelline by the oocytes is compromised. We show evidence that the polarity of the follicular epithelium and the endocytic pathway, which is crucial for the proper yolk deposition, are affected. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying oocyte development and show that Rp-BicC is important for de developenta of the egg and, therefore, a key player in the reproduction of this Chagas disease vector.\n\nAuthor summaryThe oogenesis is the process of egg formation. It is essential to guarantee transgenerational inheritance. It implies the differentiation of the gamete (oocyte) from a niche of stem cells in the germ line, the accumulation of yolk, and the formation of the chorion. These events are entangled in a regulated manner by the concerted communication between the different cell types that form the ovary. It is regulated by endogenous gene networks and linked to the physiological state of the insect by hormonal clues. This timely orchestrated process represents the interaction of gene networks. The genetic regulation behind the oogenesis is largely unknown in Rhodnius prolixus. Here we identified a gene required for egg formation that interferes the uptake of the yolk by affecting the functional integrity of the follicular epithelium. Our results are of interest for a better understanding of a complex process essential for the survival of vector populations and provide knowledge to envisage and design new strategies for vector control.",

    "abstract": "Grainyhead like 2 (GRHL2) is one of three mammalian homologues of the grainyhead (GRH) gene. It suppresses the oncogenic epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), acting as a tumor suppressor. On the other hand, GHRL2 promotes cell proliferation by increasing human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) activity, serving as a tumor promoter. According to gene expression profiling, breast cancer can be divided into basal-like (basal A and basal B), luminal-like, HER2 enriched, claudin-low and normal-like subtypes. To identify common and subtype-specific genomic binding sites of GRHL2 in breast cancer, GRHL2 ChIP-seq was performed in three luminal-like and three basal A human breast cancer cell lines. Most binding sites of GRHL2 were found in intergenic and intron regions. 13,351 common binding sites were identified in basal A cells, which included 551 binding sites in gene promoter regions. For luminal-like cells, 6,527 common binding sites were identified, of which 208 binding sites were found in gene promoter regions. Basal A and luminal-like breast cancer cells shared 4711 GRHL2 binding sites, of which 171 binding sites were found in gene promoter regions. The identified GRHL2-binding motifs are all identical to a motif reported for human ovarian cancer, indicating conserved GRHL2 DNA-binding among human cancer cells. Notably, no binding sites of GRHL2 were detected in the promoter regions of several established EMT-related genes, including CDH1, ZEB1, ZEB2 and CDH2 genes. Collectively, this study provides a comprehensive overview of interactions of GRHL2 with DNA and lays the foundation for further understanding of common and subtype-specific signaling pathways regulated by GRHL2 in breast cancer.",
