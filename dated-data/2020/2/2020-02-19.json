    "abstract": "BackgroundThe need of digital tools for integrative analysis is today important in most scientific areas. It leads to several community-driven initiatives to standardize the sharing of data and computational workflows. However, there exists no open agnostic framework to model and implement computation workflows, in particular in bioinformatics. It is therefore difficult for data scientists to share transparently and integrate heterogeneous analysis processes coming from different scientific domains, programing languages, projects or teams.\n\nResultsWe present here BioTracs, a transversal framework for computational workflow standardization and traceability. It is based on PRISM architecture (Process Resource Interfacing SysteM), an agnostic open architecture we introduce here to standardize the way processes and resources can be modelled and interfaced in computational workflows to ensure traceability, reproducibility and facilitate sharing. BioTracs is today implemented in MATLAB and available under open source license on GitHub. Several BioTracs-derived applications are also available online. They were successfully applied to large-scale metabolomics and clinical studies and demonstrated flexibility and robustness.\n\nConclusionsAs an implementation of the PRISM architecture, BioTracs paved the way to an open framework in which bioinformatics could specify ad model workflows. PRISM architecture is designed to provide scalability and transparency from the code to the project level we less efforts. It could also be implemented using open object-oriented languages such as Python, C++ or java.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=106 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/951624v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3775deorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b5672org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c87ff7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@495f2d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is the leading cause of mortality in breast cancer patients, with brain metastases becoming increasingly prevalent. Studying this disease is challenging due to the limited experimental models and methods available. Here, we used iron-based cellular MRI to track the fate of a mammary carcinoma cell line (MDA-MB-231-BR) in vivo to characterize the growth of brain metastases in the nude and severely immune-compromised NOD/SCID/ILIIrg-/- (NSG) mouse.\n\nNude and NSG mice received injections of iron-labeled MDA-MB-231-BR cells. Images were acquired with a 3T MR system and assessed for signal voids and metastases. The percentage of signal voids and the number and volume of metastases were quantified. Ex vivo imaging of the liver, histology, and immunofluorescence labeling was performed.\n\nOn day 0, iron-labeled cells were visualized as signal voids throughout the brain. The percentage of voids decreased significantly between day 0 and endpoint. At endpoint, there was no difference in the number of brain metastases or tumour burden in NSG mice compared to nudes. Tumour volumes in nude mice were significantly larger than in NSG mice. Body images indicated that the NSG mice had metastases in the liver, lungs, and lymph nodes.\n\nCharacterization of the NSG and nude mouse is necessary to study breast cancer brain metastasis in vivo. Here, we show that the 231BR cell line grew differently in NSG mice compared to nude mice. This work demonstrates the role that imaging can play toward credentialing these models that cannot be done with other in vitro or histopathologic methods alone.",

    "abstract": "The Extended Evolutionary Synthesis invokes a role for development in shaping adaptive evolution, which in population genetics terms corresponds to mutation-biased adaptation. Critics have claimed that clonal interference makes mutation-biased adaptation rare. We consider the behavior of two simultaneously adapting traits, one with larger mutation rate U, the other with larger selection coefficient s, using asexual traveling wave models. We find that adaptation is dominated by whichever trait has the faster rate of adaptation v in isolation, with the other trait subject to evolutionary stalling. Reviewing empirical claims for mutation-biased adaptation, we find that not all occur in the \"origin-fixation\" regime of population genetics where v is only twice as sensitive to s as to U. In some cases, differences in U are at least ten to twelve times larger than differences in s, as needed to cause mutation-biased adaptation even in the \"multiple mutations\" regime. Surprisingly, when U > s in the \"diffusive-mutation\" regime, the required sensitivity ratio is also only two, despite pervasive clonal interference. Given two traits with identical v, the benefit of having higher s is surprisingly small, occurring largely when one trait is at the boundary between the origin-fixation and multiple mutations regimes.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance in microbial communities reflects a combination of processes operating at different scales. The molecular mechanisms underlying antibiotic resistance are increasingly understood, but less is known about how these molecular events give rise to spatiotemporal behavior on longer length scales. In this work, we investigate the population dynamics of bacterial colonies comprised of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cells undergoing range expansion under antibiotic stress. Using the opportunistic pathogen E. faecalis with plasmid-encoded ({beta}-lactamase) resistance as a model system, we track colony expansion dynamics and visualize spatial pattern formation in fluorescently labeled populations exposed to ampicillin, a commonly-used {beta}-lactam antibiotic. We find that the radial expansion rate of mixed communities is approximately constant over a wide range of drug concentrations and initial population compositions. Fluorescence imaging of the final populations shows that resistance to ampicillin is cooperative, with sensitive cells surviving in the presence of resistant cells even at drug concentrations lethal to sensitive-only communities. Furthermore, despite the relative invariance of expansion rate across conditions, the populations exhibit a diverse range of spatial segregation patterns, with both the spatial structure and the population composition depending on drug concentration, initial composition, and initial population size. Agent based models indicate that the observed dynamics are consistent with long-range cooperation, despite the fact that {beta}-lactamase remains cell-associated in E. faecalis, and experiments confirm that resistant colonies provide a protective effect to sensitive cells on length scales multiple times the size of a single colony. Furthermore, in the limit of small inoculum sizes, we experimentally show that populations seeded with (on average) no more than a single resistant cell can produce mixed communities in the presence of drug. While biophysical models of diffusion-limited drug degradation suggest that individual resistant cells offer only short-range protection to neighboring sensitive cells, we show that long-range protection may arise from synergistic effects of multiple resistant cells, even when they represent only a small fraction of a colonys surface area. Our results suggest that {beta}-lactam resistance can be cooperative even in spatially extended systems where genetic segregation typically disfavors exploitation of locally produced public goods.",

    "abstract": "Prochlorococcus cells are the numerically dominant phototrophs in the open ocean. Cyanophages that infect them are thus a notable fraction of the total viral population in the euphotic zone, and, as vehicles of horizontal gene transfer, appear to drive their evolution. Here we examine the propensity of three cyanophages - a podovirus, a siphovirus, and a myovirus - to mispackage host DNA in their capsids while infecting Prochlorococcus, the first step in phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer. We find the mispackaging frequencies are distinctly different among the three phages. Myoviruses mispackage host DNA at low and stable frequencies, while podo- and siphoviruses vary in their mispackaging frequencies by orders of magnitude depending on growth light intensity. We attribute this difference to the concentration of intracellular reactive oxygen species and protein synthesis rates. Based on our findings, we propose a model of mispackaging frequency determined by the imbalance between the production of capsids and the number of phage genome copies during infection.",

    "abstract": "A classic example of an all-protein natural nano-bioreactor, the bacterial microcompartments are a special kind of prokaryotic organelles that confine enzymes within a small volume enveloped by an outer layer of shell proteins. This arrangement provides conditional metabolic aid to the bacteria. The outer shell allows selective diffusion of small molecules and sequesters toxic metabolites. In this work we use 1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartment as a model to study the effect of molecular confinement on the stability and catalytic activity of native enzymes in microcompartment. We observe a 50% decrease in the activity of free enzyme PduCDE at 45{degrees}C, while PduMCP retains its optimum activity till 50{degrees}C followed by more than 40% reduced activity at 55{degrees}C. PduBB, the major component of the outer shell contributes to the increased catalytic activity of PduCDE. PduBB also prevents the unfolding and aggregation of PduCDE under thermal stress. Using a combination of experimental and theoretical studies we probe the interactions of the shell proteins PduBB, N-terminal truncated PduB and single mutant PduBM38L with PduCDE. We observe that all the three variants of PduB* shell proteins interact with the enzyme in vitro, but only PduBB influences its activity and stability, underscoring the significance of the unique combination of PduB and PduB in PduMCP assembly.",

    "abstract": "In the context of human disease, the mechanisms whereby transcription factors reprogram gene expression in response to injury are not well understood. This is particularly true in kidney podocytes, injury to which is the common and initial event in many processes that lead End Stage Kidney Disease. WT1 is a master regulator of gene expression in podocytes, binding nearly all genes known to be crucial for maintenance of the glomerular filtration barrier. Here, using purified populations of podocytes and glomeruli, we investigated WT1-mediated transcriptional reprogramming during the course of podocyte injury. Using the Adriamycin murine model of Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis, we discovered that podocyte injury led to increased intensity of WT1 binding and to the acquisition of new WT1 binding sites, both at previously identified target genes and at newly bound target genes, providing mechanistic insight on the transcriptional response to injury. We also observed a previously unrecognized transient increase in expression of WT1 target genes in both mice and human kidney organoids. Together, these features appear to constitute an attempt to repair the glomerular filtration barrier after podocyte injury. At later stages of injury, when proteinuria became severe, there was greatly decreased WT1 binding to most target genes. Furthermore, WT1 appeared to be required to maintain active chromatin marks at its target genes. These active marks were converted to repressive marks after loss of WT1 or Adriamycin-induced injury. This response to injury suggests that there may be a potential window of opportunity for repairing podocyte injury as a treatment for glomerular disease in humans.",

    "abstract": "Arabidopsis REIL proteins are cytosolic ribosomal 60S-biogenesis factors. After shift to 10{degrees}C, reil mutants deplete and slowly replenish non-translating eukaryotic ribosome complexes of root tissue, while tightly controlling the balance of non-translating 40S- and 60S-subunits. Reil mutations compensate by hyper-accumulation of non-translating subunits at steady-state temperature; after cold-shift, a KCl-sensitive 80S sub-fraction remains depleted. We infer that Arabidopsis buffers fluctuating translation by pre-existing non-translating ribosomes before de novo synthesis meets temperature-induced demands. Reil1 reil2 double mutants accumulate 43S-preinitiation and pre-60S-maturation complexes and have altered paralog composition of ribosomal proteins in non-translating complexes. With few exceptions, e.g. RPL3B and RPL24C, these changes are not under transcriptional control. Our study suggests requirement of de novo synthesis of eukaryotic ribosomes for long-term cold acclimation, feedback control of NUC2 and eIF3C2 transcription and links new proteins, AT1G03250, AT5G60530, to plant ribosome biogenesis. We propose that Arabidopsis requires biosynthesis of specialized ribosomes for cold acclimation.\n\nHighlight of this studyREIL proteins affect paralog composition of eukaryotic ribosomes and suppress accumulation of 43S-preinitiation and pre-60S-maturation complexes, suggesting functions of ribosome heterogeneity and biogenesis in plant cold acclimation.",

We examine the alternative hypothesis that stimuli are encoded with noise, then optimally decoded. Under a model of efficient coding, the amount of noise should vary across stimuli, and depend on statistics of the stimuli. We investigate these predictions through a task in which participants are asked to compare the averages of two series of numbers, each sampled from a prior distribution that varies across blocks of trials. Subjects encode numbers with a bias and a noise that both depend on the number. Infrequently occurring numbers are encoded with more noise. We show how an efficient-coding, Bayesian-decoding model accounts for these patterns, and best captures subjects behaviour. Finally, our results suggest that Wei and Stockers \"law of human perception\", which relates the bias and variability of sensory estimates, also applies to number cognition.",

For 90 days, 28 participants that received standard treatment for 37 CVUs were monitored.

Mass spectrometry analysis of all the inflammatory exudates showed four proteins differentially expressed and related to favorable or unfavorable evolution of the healing process. Complement C3 and ceruloplasmin were identified in all the lesions analyzed and were expressed differentially in lesions that presented diminished area in the studied period. Apoliprotein A1 and neutrophil defensin-1 presented differential expression in ulcers that either did not diminish or augmented their wound area through 90 days.

To advance their understanding we tested several assumptions and predictions of trait driver theory (TDT). We quantified the shape of trait distributions related to tree carbon, nutrient economics and stem hydraulics across a small-scale but steep gradient of soil water availability.\nC_LIO_LIWe utilized a unique and steep environmental gradient in the coastal Brazilian Atlantic forest (restinga) communities that spans a very short distance (207 {+/-}60 meters).

Furthermore, to detect if species directionally shift in niche space, we analyzed species composition in multidimensional hypervolume space.\nC_LIO_LIDespite short geographic distances, we observed large shifts in species replacement and intraspecific variation reflected by a directional shift in plant function. Consistent with TDT, we observe (i) trait distributions that are skewed in directions consistent with a forest responding to recent hotter and drier; (ii) peaked trait distributions, indicating strong functional convergence; and (iii) conditions decreasing means and variances of several leaf carbon and nutrient economic traits as well as stem hydraulic traits.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis.

Similarly, species that span the entire water availability gradient are characterized by directional intraspecific shifts in multi-trait space that mirror interspecific shifts. Strong environmental gradients across short spatial scales provide unique systems to accurately assess assembly processes and address long-held assumptions and timely hypothesis predicted by trait driver theory.\nC_LI",

Increasing the capacity of detecting Y chromosomal polymorphisms will drastically narrow down the matching number of genealogy populations or pedigrees. In this study, we developed a system containing 17 Y-STRs that are complementary to the current commercially available Y-STR kits. This system was constructed by multiplex PCR with expected sizes of 126-400 bp labeled by different fluorescence molecules (DYS715, DYS709, DYS716, DYS713 and DYS607 labeled by FAM; DYS718, DYS723, DYS708 and DYS714 labeled by JOE; DYS712, DYS717, DYS721 and DYS605 labeled by TAMRA; and DYS719, DYS726, DYS598 and DYS722 labeled by ROX). The system was extensively tested for sensitivity, male specificity, species specificity, mixture, population genetics and mutation rates following the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (SWGDAM) guidelines. The genetic data were obtained from eight populations with a total of 1260 individuals. Our results showed that all the 17 Y-STRs are human- and male-specific and include only one copy of the Y-chromosome. The 17 Y-STR system detects 143 alleles and has a high discrimination power (0.996031746). Mutation rates were different among the 17 Y-STRs, ranging from 0.30% to 3.03%. In conclusion, our study provides a robust, sensitive and cost-effective genotyping method for human identification, which will be beneficial for narrowing the search scope when applied to genealogy searching with the Y-STR DNA databank.",

    "abstract": "Expected Utility Theory (EUT), the first axiomatic theory of risky choice, describes choices as a utility maximization process: decision makers assign a subjective value (utility) to each choice option and choose the one with the highest utility. The continuity axiom, central to EUT and its modifications, is a necessary and sufficient condition for the definition of numerical utilities. The axiom requires decision makers to be indifferent between a gamble and a specific probabilistic combination of a more preferred and a less preferred gamble. While previous studies demonstrated that monkeys choose according to combinations of objective reward magnitude and probability, a concept-driven experimental approach for assessing the axiomatically defined conditions for maximizing subjective utility by animals is missing. We experimentally tested the continuity axiom for a broad class of gamble types in four male rhesus macaque monkeys, showing that their choice behavior complied with the existence of a numerical utility measure as defined by the economic theory. We used the numerical quantity specified in the continuity axiom to characterize subjective preferences in a magnitude-probability space. This mapping highlighted a trade-off relation between reward magnitudes and probabilities, compatible with the existence of a utility function underlying subjective value computation. These results support the existence of a numerical utility function able to describe choices, allowing for the investigation of the neuronal substrates responsible for coding such rigorously defined quantity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTA common assumption of several economic choice theories is that decisions result from the comparison of subjectively assigned values (utilities). This study demonstrated the compliance of monkey behavior with the continuity axiom of Expected Utility Theory, implying a subjective magnitude-probability trade-off relation which supports the existence of numerical subjective utility directly linked to the theoretical economic framework. We determined a numerical utility measure able to describe choices, which can serve as a correlate for the neuronal activity in the quest for brain structures and mechanisms guiding decisions.",

    "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is an embryonic tumor that represents the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. Resistance to therapy is attributed, in part, to the persistence of a subpopulation of slowly dividing cancer stem cells (CSCs) within those tumors. Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3{beta} is an active proline-directed serine/threonine kinase, well-known to be involved in different signaling pathways entangled in the pathophysiology of neuroblastoma. This study aims to assess the potency of an irreversible GSK-3{beta} inhibitor drug, Tideglusib (TDG), in suppressing proliferation, viability, and migration of human neuroblastoma cell lines, as well as its effects on their CSCs subpopulation in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that treatment with TDG significantly reduced cell proliferation, viability, and migration of SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y cells. TDG also significantly inhibited neurospheres formation capability in both cell lines, eradicating the self-renewal ability of highly resistant CSCs. Importantly, TDG potently inhibited neuroblastoma tumor growth and progression in vivo. In conclusion, TDG proved to be an effective in vitro and in vivo treatment for neuroblastoma cell lines and may hence serve as a potential adjuvant therapeutic agent for this aggressive nervous system tumor.",

    "abstract": "Mutations affecting the RAS-MAPK pathway occur frequently in relapsed neuroblastoma tumors and are associated with response to MEK inhibition in vitro. However, these inhibitors alone do not lead to tumor regression in vivo, indicating the need for combination therapy. Through high throughput combination screening we identify Trametinib and inhibitors of the BCL2 family (Navitoclax and Venetoclax) as a promising combination in neuroblastoma cells with RAS-MAPK mutations. In these lines, inhibiting the RAS-MAPK pathway leads to Bim stabilization and increased sensitivity to compounds inhibiting Bim binding to Bcl2 family members. Combining Trametinib with BCL2 inhibitors causes increased growth inhibition compared to Trametinib only in NRAS mutant SKNAS xenografts, while BCL2 inihibitors alone do not affect growth of these tumors. These results show that MEK inhibitors and specific Bcl2 family member inhibitors are a potent combination for RAS-MAPK mutated neuroblastoma tumors.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs), short non-coding RNAs, which act post-transcriptionally to regulate gene expression, are of widespread significance during development and disease, including muscle disease. Advances in sequencing technology and bioinformatics led to the identification of a large number of miRNAs in vertebrates and other species, however, for many of these miRNAs specific roles have not yet been determined. LNA in situ hybridisation has revealed expression patterns of somite-enriched miRNAs, here we focus on characterising the functions of miR-128. We show that antagomir-mediated knock-down (KD) of miR-128 in developing chick somites has a negative impact on skeletal myogenesis. Computational analysis identified the transcription factor EYA4 as a candidate target consistent with the observation that miR-128 and EYA4 display similar expression profiles. Luciferase assays confirmed that miR-128 interacts with the EYA4 3UTR. Furthermore, in vivo experiments suggest that EYA4 is regulated by miR-128, as EYA4 expression is derepressed after antagomir-mediated inhibition of miR-128. EYA4 is a member of the PAX-SIX-EYA-DACH (PSED) network of transcription factors. Therefore, we identified additional candidate miRNA binding sites in the 3UTR of SIX1/4, EYA1/2/3 and DACH1. Using the miRanda algorithm, we found sites for miR-128, as well as for other myogenic miRNAs, miR-1a, miR-206 and miR-133a, some of these were experimentally confirmed as functional miRNA-target sites. Our results reveal that miR-128 is involved in regulating skeletal myogenesis by targeting EYA4 transcripts and moreover that the PSED network of transcription factors is co-regulated by multiple muscle-enriched microRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Spotted owls (SO, Strix occidentalis) are a keystone species inhabiting old-growth forests in Western North America. In recent decades, their populations have declined due to ongoing reductions in suitable habitat caused by logging, wildfires, and competition with the congeneric barred owl (BO, Strix varia). The northern spotted owl (subspecies S. o. caurina) has been listed as \"threatened\" under the Endangered Species Act since 1990. Here we present a comprehensive look at genetic variation to elucidate the population histories of SO and invading western BO. Specifically, we present an improved SO genome assembly, based on 10x and Bionano Genomics data, along with 51 high-coverage whole-genome sequences including 11 SO from two subspecies (caurina and occidentalis), 25 BO, 2 confirmed and 13 potential hybrids. We identified potential hybrids based on intermediate morphology and found them to be a mixture of pure BO, F1 hybrids, and F1 x BO backcrosses. Unlike previous studies reporting asymmetries in the species-specific genders of the parents of F1 hybrids, we did not observe any significant asymmetry. Within species, we found that Western BO genetic variation is not simply a subset of the genetic variation in Eastern BO, suggesting that the two groups have been genetically isolated for longer (thousands of years) than previously suspected (80-130 years). Similarly, we found evidence of substantial genetic differentiation between the two SO subspecies. Finally, our analyses suggest that Northern SO experienced a moderate population bottleneck around the end of the last glaciation, while BO population sizes have always been large.",

The identity and mechanism of many effectors remain unknown. We characterized a Salmonella SPI-6 T6SS antibacterial effector called Tae5STM (type VI amidase effector 5). Tae5STM is toxic in target-cell periplasm and is neutralized by its cognate immunity protein (Tai5STM). Microscopy analysis revealed that cells expressing the effector stop dividing and lose cell envelope integrity. Bioinformatic analysis uncovered similarities between Tae5STM and the catalytic domain of L,D-transpeptidase. Point mutations on conserved catalytic histidine and cysteine residues abrogated toxicity. Biochemical assays revealed that Tae5STM displays L,D-carboxypeptidase activity, cleaving peptidoglycan tetrapeptides between meso-diaminopimelic acid3 and D-alanine4. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Tae5STM homologs constitutes a new superfamily of T6SS-associated amidase effectors distributed among -, {beta}- and {gamma}-proteobacteria.

    "abstract": "Nanopore sequencing provides a great opportunity for direct detection of chemical DNA modification. However, existing computational methods were either trained for detecting a specific form of DNA modification from one, or a few, specific sequence contexts (e.g. 5-methylcytosine from CpG dinucleotides) or for allowing de novo detection without effectively differentiating between different forms of DNA modifications. As a result, none of these methods supports de novo, systematic study of unknown bacterial methylomes. In this work, by examining three types of DNA methylation in a large diversity of sequence contexts, we observed that nanopore sequencing signal displays complex heterogeneity across methylation events of the same type. To capture this complexity and enable nanopore sequencing for broadly applicable methylation discovery, we generated a training dataset from an assortment of bacterial species and developed a novel method that couples the identification and fine mapping of the three forms of DNA methylation into a multi-label classification design. We evaluated the method and then applied it to individual bacteria and mouse gut microbiome for reliable methylation discovery. In addition, we demonstrated in the microbiome analysis the use of DNA methylation for binning metagenomic contigs, associating mobile genetic elements with their host genomes, and for the first time, identifying misassembled metagenomic contigs. This novel method has broad utility for discovering different forms of DNA methylation from bacteria, assisting functional studies of epigenetic regulation in bacteria, and exploiting bacterial epigenomes for more effective metagenomic analyses.",

    "abstract": "The brains response to sensory input is modulated by prediction. For example, sounds that are produced by ones own actions, or those that are strongly predicted by environmental cues, are perceived as less salient and elicit an attenuated N1 component in the auditory evoked potential. Here we examined whether the neural response to direct stimulation of the brain is attenuated by prediction in a similar manner. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied over primary motor cortex can be used to gauge the excitability of the motor system. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs), elicited by TMS and measured in peripheral muscles, are larger when actions are being prepared and smaller when actions are voluntarily suppressed. We tested whether the amplitude of MEPs was attenuated under circumstances where the TMS pulse can be reliably predicted, even though control of the relevant motor effector was never required. Self-initiation of the TMS pulse and reliable cuing of the TMS pulse both attenuated MEP amplitudes, compared to MEPs generated programmatically in an unpredictable manner. These results suggest that predictive coding may be governed by domain-general mechanisms responsible for all forms predictive learning.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a preferential involvement of both upper and lower motor neurons. Evidence from neuroimaging and post-mortem studies confirms additional involvement of brain regions extending beyond the motor cortex. The aim of this study was to assess the extent of cerebral disease in ALS cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and to compare the findings with a recently proposed disease-staging model of ALS pathology. Deformation-based morphometry (DBM) was used to identify the patterns of brain atrophy associated with ALS and to assess their relationship with clinical symptoms. Longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data and clinical measures were acquired at baseline, 4 months, and 8 months, from 66 ALS patients and 43 age-matched controls who participated in the Canadian ALS Neuroimaging Consortium (CALSNIC) study. Whole brain voxel-wise mixed-effects modelling analysis showed extensive atrophy patterns differentiating ALS patients from the normal controls. Cerebral atrophy was present in the motor cortex and corticospinal tract, involving both GM and WM, and to a lesser extent in non-motor regions. More specifically, the results showed significant bilateral atrophy in the motor cortex, the corticospinal tract including the internal capsule and brainstem, with an overall pattern of ventricular enlargement; along with significant progressive longitudinal atrophy in the precentral gyrus, frontal and parietal white matter, accompanied by ventricular and sulcal enlargement. Atrophy in the precentral gyrus was significantly associated with greater disability as quantified with the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) (p<0.0001). The pattern of atrophy observed using DBM was consistent with the Brettschneiders four stage pathological model of the disease. Deformation based morphometry provides a sensitive indicator of atrophy in ALS, and has potential as a biomarker of disease burden, in both gray and white matter.",

Evaluating the significance of these findings requires establishing statistical expectations under a null hypothesis of interest. Through generative modeling of synthetic data that instantiate a specific null hypothesis, quantitative benchmarks can be derived for arbitrarily complex statistical measures. Here, we present a generative null model, provided as an open-access software platform, that generates surrogate maps with spatial autocorrelation (SA) matched to SA of a target brain map. SA is a prominent and ubiquitous property of brain maps that violates assumptions of independence in conventional statistical tests. Our method can simulate surrogate brain maps, constrained by empirical data, that preserve the SA of cortical, subcortical, parcellated, and dense brain maps. We characterize how SA impacts p-values in pairwise brain map comparisons. Furthermore, we demonstrate how SA-preserving surrogate maps can be used in gene ontology enrichment analyses to test hypotheses of interest related to brain map topography. Our findings demonstrate the utility of SA-preserving surrogate maps for hypothesis testing in complex statistical analyses, and underscore the need to disambiguate meaningful relationships from chance associations in studies of large-scale brain organization.",

    "abstract": "\"Lipotoxicity\" induced by excessive accumulation of free fatty acids (FFAs) in the liver, especially saturated FAs and their toxic metabolites, is closely related to metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a novel gaseous signaling molecule, has been reported to have lipid-lowering effects, but its effect on FAs metabolism remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanisms of anethole dithiolethione (ADT, a sustained-release H2S donor) on hepatic FAs metabolism. ADT was administered daily for 4 weeks in male Syrian golden hamsters fed a high fat diet (HFD), and FAs profiles of liver tissues were analyzed using GC-MS. The results showed that in HFD-fed hamsters, ADT treatment significantly reduced the accumulation of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids (C16:0, C18:0, C16:1, and C18:1n9), while increased the content of n-6 and n-3 series polyunsaturated fatty acids (C20:3n6, C20:4n6, and C22:6n3). Mechanistically, ADT obviously inhibited the overexpression of ACC1, FAS and SCD1, and up-regulated the levels of FATPs, L-FABP, CPT1, FADS1 and FADS2. Notably, ADT evidently induced Mitofusin1 to facilitate mitochondrial fusion and optimize {beta}-oxidation. These findings suggest that ADT plays a beneficial role by regulating the synthesis, desaturation, {beta}-oxidation, uptake, binding/isolation, and transport of FAs. In conclusion, ADT is effective in improving liver FAs metabolic disorders and liver injuries caused by HFD.",

    "abstract": "Understanding metabolic function requires knowledge of the dynamics, interdependence, and regulation of biochemical networks. However, current approaches are not optimal to develop the needed mechanistic understanding, and misconceptions about biological processes persist even after graduation. To address these issues, we developed a computational modeling and simulation approach that employs scaffolded learning to teach biochemistry students about the regulation of metabolism. The power of the approach lies in students abilities to alter any component or connection in a modeled system and instantly observe the effects of their changes. We find that students who use our approach perform better on biochemistry metabolism questions compared to students in a course that did not use this approach. We also investigated performance by gender and found that our modules may have the potential to increase equity in education. We noted that students are generally positive about the approach and appreciate its benefits. Our modules provide life science instructors with a dynamic and systems-driven approach to teach metabolic regulation and control that improves learning and also equips students with important technical skills.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are abundant in the tumor microenvironment (TME), serving as accomplices to cancer cells for their invasion. Studies have explored the biochemical mechanisms that drive pro-tumor macrophage functions, however the role of TME interstitial flow (IF) is often disregarded. Therefore, we developed a three-dimensional microfluidic-based model with tumor cells and macrophages to study how IF affects macrophage migration and its potential contribution to cancer invasion. The presence of either tumor cells or IF individually increased macrophage migration directedness and speed. Interestingly, there was no additive effect on macrophage migration directedness and speed under the simultaneous presence of tumor cells and IF. Further, we present an in silico model that couples chemokine-mediated signaling with mechanosensing networks to explain our in vitro observations. The model proposes IL-8, CCL2 and {beta}-integrin as key pathways that commonly regulate various Rho GTPases. In agreement, in vitro macrophage migration remained elevated when exposed to a saturating concentration of recombinant IL-8 or CCL2, or to the co-addition of a sub-optimal concentration of both cytokines. Moreover, antibody blockade against IL-8 and/or CCL2 inhibited migration that could be restored by IF, indicating cytokine-independent mechanisms of migration induction. Importantly, we demonstrate the utility of an integrated in silico and 3D in vitro approach to aid the design of tumor-associated macrophage-based immunotherapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The spatial organization of microbial communities arises from a complex interplay of biotic and abiotic interactions and is a major determinant of ecosystem functions. We design a microfluidic platform to investigate how the spatial arrangement of microbes impacts gene expression and growth. We elucidate key biochemical parameters that dictate the mapping between spatial positioning and gene expression patterns. We show that distance can establish a low-pass filter to periodic inputs, and can enhance the fidelity of information processing. Positive and negative feedback can play disparate roles in the synchronization and robustness of a genetic oscillator distributed between two strains to spatial separation. Quantification of growth and metabolite release in an amino-acid auxotroph community demonstrates that the interaction network and stability of the community are highly sensitive to temporal perturbations and spatial arrangements. In sum, our microfluidic platform can quantify spatiotemporal parameters influencing diffusion-mediated interactions in microbial consortia.",

Estimates of statistical confidence in lipid identification are essential for downstream data interpretation in a biological context. In the related field of proteomics, a variety of methods for estimating false-discovery are available, and understanding the statistical confidence of identifications is typically required for data analysis and hypothesis testing. However, there is no current method for estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) or statistical confidence for MS-based lipid identifications. This has slowed the adoption of MS-based lipidomics research, as all identifications require manual inspection and validation to ensure their accuracy. We present here the first generalizable method for FDR estimation, a target/decoy approach, that allows those conducting MS-based lipidomics research to confidently adjust spectral score thresholds to minimize false discovery and to enable full automation of data analysis.",

    "abstract": "Abscisic acid (ABA) transport plays important role in systematic plant responses to environmental factors. Here, we showed that C-terminally encoded peptide receptor 2 (CEPR2) directly interacted with the ABA transporter NRT1.2. Using transgenic seedlings, we demonstrated that NRT1.2 positively regulated the ABA response, and that CEPR2 acted on NRT1.2 epistatically and negatively. Under normal conditions, CEPR2 phosphorylated NRT1.2 at least at serine 292 to promote the degradation of NRT1.2. However, ABA and serine 292 nonphospharylation strongly inhibited the degradation of NRT1.2, indicating that ABA-inhibited the phosphorylation of NRT1.2. Transport assays in yeast and Xenopus oocytes showed that nonphosphorylated NRT1.2 had high levels of ABA-import activity, but phosphorylated NRT1.2 did not import ABA. Analyses of complement nrt1.2 mutants by mimicking nonphospharylated and phospharylated NRT1.2 confirmed that nonphospharylated NRT1.2S292A had high stability and ABA import activity in planta. Further experiments indicated that NRT1.2 was degraded via the 26S proteasome and vacuolar degradation pathways. UBC32, UBC33, and UBC34 interacted with, and mediated the ubiquitination of NRT1.2. UBC32, UBC33, and UBC34 acted on NRT1.2 epistatically and negatively in planta. Thus, our results suggested the existence of novel plant mechanisms regulating NRT1.2 stability and ABA import activity in response to environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Duplication 15q syndrome (Dup15q) is a rare neurogenetic disorder characterized by autistic features and difficult to control (pharmacoresistant) epileptic seizures. Most individuals with isodicentric (idic15) have been on multiple medications to control their seizures and some are still seizing after years of treatment. We recently developed a model of Dup15q in Drosophila by elevating levels of fly Dube3a in glial cells, not neurons. Unlike other Dup15q models, these flies develop seizures that worsen as flies age. Here we used this new model to screen for previously approved compounds from the Prestwick Chemical Library which are able to suppress seizures in flies over-expressing Dube3a in glia using the pan glial driver repo-GAL4. We identified 17 out of 1280 compounds in the library that could suppress a bang sensitive (seizure) phenotype. Eight of these compounds were able to suppress seizures significantly in both males and females by at least 50%. Half of these strong seizure suppressors regulated either serotoninergic or dopaminergic signaling and subsequent experiments confirmed that seizure suppression occurs through stimulation of serotonin receptor 5-HT1A but can be further suppressed with the addition of L-Dopa (Levodopa). We provide further support for a seizure model where Dube3a regulation of the Na+/K+ exchanger ATP in glia can also be modulated by serotonin/dopamine signaling. Finally, based on these pharmacological and genetic studies, we present an argument for the use of 5-HT1A agonists in the treatment of Dup15q epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are associated with defects in neuronal connectivity and are highly heritable. Genetic findings suggest that there is an overrepresentation of chromatin regulatory genes among the genes associated with ASD. ASH1 like histone lysine methyltransferase (ASH1L) was identified as a major risk factor for autism. ASH1L methylates Histone H3 on Lysine 36, which is proposed to result primarily in transcriptional activation. However, how mutations in ASH1L lead to deficits in neuronal connectivity associated with autism pathogenesis is not known. We report that ASH1L regulates neuronal morphogenesis by counteracting the catalytic activity of Polycomb Repressive complex 2 group (PRC2) in stem cell-derived human neurons. Depletion of ASH1L decreases neurite outgrowth and decreases expression of the gene encoding the neurotrophin receptor TrkB whose signaling pathway is linked to neuronal morphogenesis. This is overcome by inhibition of PRC2 activity, indicating a balance between the Trithorax group protein ASH1L and PRC2 activity determines neuronal morphology and connectivity. Thus, ASH1L epigenetically regulates neuronal connectivity by modulating the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway, which likely contributes to the neurodevelopmental pathogenesis associated with ASD in patients with ASH1L mutations.\n\neTOC BLURBCheon et al. report a novel epigenetic mechanism that implicates the counteracting activities of the evolutionarily conserved Trithorax (ASH1L) and Polycomb (PRC2) chromatin regulators, in the modulation of human neuronal connectivity by regulating the developmentally important TrkB-BDNF signaling pathway.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=105 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/954586v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@738ee5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@aa8085org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dbc315org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e4bfa2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIASH1L regulates neuronal morphogenesis by modulating neurotrophin signaling\nC_LIO_LICounteracting activities of Trithorax (ASH1L) and Polycomb (PRC2) affect neuronal arborization\nC_LIO_LILoss of ASH1L modulates growth cone size in human neurons\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is considerable interest in identifying peripheral biomarkers that reflect neuropathological changes in schizophrenia. Extracellular vesicles, including exosomes can cross the blood brain barrier with their contents intact and their cargo, including lipids, proteins and genetic materials can be assayed peripherally. Circulating exosomes have been studied in other neurodegenerative disorders, but there is scarce data in schizophrenia.\n\nMethodsWe examined neuropathology relevant protein biomarkers in circulating exosomes from patients with schizophrenia and age and gender matched healthy controls using methods consistent with the recommended \"Minimal information for studies of extracellular vesicles 2018\" (MISEV2018) guidelines. Nanoparticle tracking analysis was used to determine the size and concentration of exosomes. Exosomal membrane marker (CD9) and specific target cargo proteins (glial fibrillary acid protein[GFAP], synaptophysin and -II-spectrin) immunopositivity was examined using Western blot analyses and band intensity quantified.\n\nResultsNo group differences were observed between schizophrenia and control samples in plasma exosomal concentration and size or in CD9 or calnexin positivity. Exosomal GFAP concentration was significantly higher and -II-spectrin expression significantly lower in schizophrenia samples and there were no group differences observed for exosomal synaptophysin concentration.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate for the first time, a differential pattern of exosomal protein expression in schizophrenia compared to matched healthy controls, consistent with the hypothesized astro-glial pathology in this disorder. These results warrant further examination of circulating exosomes as vehicles of novel peripheral biomarkers of disease in schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disorders.",

However, the neural constituents and their interactions that allow us to identify written words are not well understood. Using direct intracranial recordings in a large cohort of humans, we comprehensively isolated the spatiotemporal dynamics of visual word recognition across the entire left ventral occipitotemporal cortex. The mid-fusiform cortex is the first region that is sensitive to word identity and to both sub-lexical and lexical frequencies. Its activation, response latency and amplitude, are highly dependent on the statistics of natural language. Information about lexicality and word frequency propagates posteriorly from this region to traditional visual word form regions and to earlier visual cortex. This unique sensitivity of mid-fusiform cortex to the lexical characteristics of written words points to its central role as an orthographic lexicon, which accesses the long-term memory representations of visual word forms.",

    "abstract": "Current treatments for obesity are unable to reliably reduce weight over time and alternative treatments need to address this challenge. New interventions that target the nervous system could manipulate brain networks underlying reward, metabolic rate and behavior. Here, the ventral pallidum was evaluated as a target of manipulation due to its established role in the networks underlying motivation, pleasure and behavioral output. Chronic inhibitory or excitatory chemogenetic activation was used to modulate the activity of ventral pallidum (VP) targeted neurons in rats on an obesogenic diet. We hypothesized that inhibition of VP activity would decrease the salience of the rats high-sugar, high-fat diet and lead to reduced food consumption and weight gain over time. Paradoxically, measurements of weight, water and food consumption revealed significantly increased weight gain in both groups receiving VP targeted manipulation that was not readily explained by food or water consumption. We theorize that the complex reciprocal feedback between ventral striatal structures (e.g., VP) and metabolic centers of the hypothalamus and brainstem, demonstrated by prior research, likely underpin our findings. This study suggests that the treatment of appetitive disorders (e.g., obesity) with chronic neuromodulation-based interventions could be burdened by the delayed onset of outcomes that are difficult to predict from related prior studies that used acute interventions.",

Previous work suggests that these behavioral modes are controlled separately, but it is unknown whether the cerebral cortex represents them differently. Here, we investigated this question by recording high-density electrocorticography from the motor and premotor cortices of seven human subjects performing a sequential movement-force motor task. We decoded finger movement (0.7{+/-}0.3 fractional variance account for; FVAF) and force (0.7{+/-}0.2 FVAF) with high accuracy, yet found different spatial representations. We also found clear distinctions in electrocorticographic activity by using deep learning methods to uncover state-space representations, and by developing a new metric, the neural vector angle. Thus, state-space techniques can help to investigate broad cortical networks. Finally, we were able to classify the behavioral mode from neural signals with high accuracy (90{+/-}6%). Thus, finger movement and force have distinct representations in motor/premotor cortices. This will inform our understanding of the neural control of movement as well as the design of grasp brain-machine interfaces.",

    "abstract": "RationaleRadiation induced heart disease (RIHD) is a significant delayed/late effect of ionizing radiation exposure.\n\nObjectiveTo determine the cardiac effects of total body irradiation (TBI) in male rhesus macaques, a translational non-human primate (NHP) model.\n\nMethods and ResultsEchocardiography was performed on survivors of a single dose (6.4-8.5 Gy) of TBI (n=34) and non-irradiated controls (n=26) divided into longer (LT IRR) and shorter term (ST IRR) survivors and controls to assess the effects of time since TBI on phenotypes. LT IRR had increased Doppler transmitral early filling velocities (E), decreased early mitral annular descent velocities (e), and higher E/e ratio compared to LT CTL (all p[&le;]0.05), indicating left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction. Echocardiographic stroke volume, cardiac output, and end-diastolic and systolic volumes were also lower in LT IRR than controls (all p [&le;] 0.05). ST IRR had similar alterations in LV diastolic function but not in cardiac volumetric measures. Analyses of LV, interventricular septum (IVS), and right ventricle (RV) myocardium from deceased irradiated animals (n=17) exposed to a single dose (6.9-8.05 Gy) TBI and non-irradiated controls (n=12) showed that IRR animals had decreased LV and IVS capillary density, and increased LV fibrosis, pan-cardiac fibroblast and macrophage staining, LV and IVS M2 macrophages, and pan-cardiac M1 macrophages (all p<0.05). While M2 predominated over M1 macrophages in both groups, M1 showed greater increases than M2 in IRR.\n\nConclusionsLV diastolic dysfunction due to radiation exposure may be due to a combination of capillary rarefication, activation and expansion of fibroblasts, and increased accumulation of both pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory macrophages, all of which lead to increased myocardial stiffness due to fibrosis. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the delayed effects of acute ionizing radiation exposure and suggest that therapies targeting macrophage regulation of fibrosis may mitigate radiation induced heart disease.",

    "abstract": "Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most common form of chronic liver disease in adults and children. It is characterized by excessive accumulation of lipids in the hepatocytes of patients without any excess alcohol intake. With a global presence of 24% and limited therapeutic options, the disease burden of NAFLD is increasing. Thus, it becomes imperative to attempt to understand the dynamics of disease progression at a systems-level. Here, we decode the emergent dynamics of underlying gene regulatory networks that have been identified to drive the initiation and progression of NAFLD. We have developed a mathematical model to elucidate the dynamics of the HNF4-PPAR{gamma} gene regulatory network. Our simulations reveal that this network can enable multiple co-existing phenotypes under certain biological conditions: an adipocyte, a hepatocyte, and a \"hybrid\" adipocyte-like state of the hepatocyte. These phenotypes may also switch among each other, thus enabling phenotypic plasticity and consequently leading to simultaneous deregulation of the levels of molecules that maintain a hepatic identity and/or facilitate a partial or complete acquisition of adipocytic traits. These predicted trends are supported by the analysis of clinical data, further substantiating the putative role of phenotypic plasticity in driving NAFLD. Our results unravel how the emergent dynamics of underlying regulatory networks can promote phenotypic plasticity, thereby propelling the clinically observed changes in gene expression often associated with NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetics can control specific molecular events in living systems, but the penetration depth of light is typically limited at hundreds of micrometers. Focused ultrasound (FUS), on the other hand, can deliver energy safely and noninvasively into tissues at depths of centimeters. Here we have developed an acoustogenetic approach using short-pulsed FUS to remotely and directly control the genetics and cellular functions of engineered mammalian cells for therapeutic purposes. We applied this acoustogenetic approach to control chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells with high spatiotemporal precision, aiming to mitigate the potentially lethal \"on-target off-tumor\" effects of CAR T cell therapy. We first verified the controllability of our acoustogenetic CAR T cells in recognizing and killing tumor cells in vitro, and then applied this approach in vivo to suppress tumor growth of both lymphoma and prostate cancers. The results indicate that FUS-based acoustogenetics can allow the noninvasive and remote activation, without any exogenous cofactor, of different types of CAR T cells for cancer therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for analyzing complex tissues with recent advances enabling the transcriptomic profiling of thousands to tens-of-thousands of individual cells. Although scRNA-seq provides unprecedented insights into the biology of heterogeneous cell populations, analyzing such data on a gene-by-gene basis is challenging due to the large number of tested hypotheses, high level of technical noise and inflated zero counts. One promising approach for addressing these challenges is gene set testing, or pathway analysis. By combining the expression data for all genes in a pathway, gene set testing can mitigate the impacts of sparsity and noise and improve interpretation, replication and statistical power. Unfortunately, statistical and biological differences between single cell and bulk expression measurements make it challenging to use gene set testing methods originally developed for bulk tissue on scRNA-seq data and progress on single cell-specific methods has been limited. To address this challenge, we have developed a new gene set testing method, variance-adjusted Mahalanobis (VAM), that seamlessly integrates with the Seurat framework and is designed to accommodate the technical noise, sparsity and large sample sizes characteristic of scRNA-seq data. The VAM method computes cell-specific pathway scores to transform a cell-by-gene matrix into a cell-by-pathway matrix that can be used for both exploratory data visualization and statistical gene set enrichment analysis. Because the distribution of these scores under the null of uncorrelated technical noise has an accurate gamma approximation, inference can be performed at both the population and single cell levels. As we demonstrate using both simulation studies and real data analyses, the VAM method provides superior classification accuracy at a lower computation cost relative to existing single sample gene set testing approaches.",

RAFS detects positive signals in common patterns of primary sequence conservation in absence of any covariation. To illustrate the severity of the problem, we show that Tavares analysis reports \"significantly covarying base pairs\" in 100% identical sequence alignments with no variation or covariation. We use Tavares sequence alignment of HOTAIR domain 1 as an example to show that the base pairs they identify as significantly covarying actually arise from primary sequence conservation patterns. Their analysis still reports similar numbers of \"significant covarying\" base pairs in a negative control in which we permute residues in independent alignment columns to destroy covariation. There remains no significant covariation support for evolutionarily conserved RNA structure in the HOTAIR lncRNA or other lncRNA structures and alignments we have analyzed.",

    "abstract": "In animal communication, receivers benefit from signals providing reliable information on signallers traits of interest. Individuals involved in conflicts, such as competition between rivals, should pay particular attention to cues that are  unfakeable by the senders due to the intrinsic properties of the production process. In bioacoustics, the best-known example of such  index signals is the relationship between a senders body size and the dominant frequency of their vocalizations. Dominant frequency may however not only depend on an animals morphology but also on the interaction between the sound production system and its immediate environment. Here, we experimentally altered the environment surrounding calling frogs and assessed its impact on the signal produced. More specifically, we altered water level, which forced frogs to float on the surface and tested how this manipulation affected the shuttling of air between the lungs and the vocal sac, and how this in turn impacted the calls dominant frequency. Our results show that frogs that are floating are able to fully inflate their lungs and vocal sacs, and that the associated change in airflow or air pressure is correlated with a decrease of call dominant frequency.",

Our analyses reveal a metazoan-typical genome architecture, with highly shared synteny across Metazoa, and suggest that adaptation to the extreme temperatures and conditions found in freshwater often involves gene duplication. The pancontinental distribution and ready laboratory culture of E. muelleri make this a highly practical model system, which with RNAseq, DNA methylation and bacterial amplicon data spanning its development and range allows exploration of genomic changes both within sponges and in early animal evolution.",

We then use genome editing to disrupt the coding sequence of a S. rosetta C-type lectin gene, rosetteless, and thereby demonstrate its necessity for multicellular rosette development.

A comprehensive understanding of gene activity in the context of the disease is crucial to identify etiological components and their potential interplay. So far, this understanding is lacking, primarily due to the scarcity of samples and suitable tissue.\n\nIn order to close this gap, we profiled endometrial tissue of uterus rudiments in a large cohort of MRKH patients using RNA-seq and thereby provide a genome-wide view on the altered transcription landscape of the MRKH syndrome. Differential and co-expression analyses of the data identified cellular processes and candidate genes that converge on a core network of interconnected regulators that emerge as pivotal for the perturbed expression space.

    "abstract": "Hippo signalling regulates eye growth during embryogenesis through its effectors YAP and TAZ. Taking advantage of a Yap heterozygous mouse line, we here sought to examine its function in adult neural retina, where YAP expression is restricted to Muller glia. We first discovered an unexpected temporal dynamic of gene compensation. At post-natal stages, Taz upregulation occurs, leading to a gain of function-like phenotype characterized by EGFR signalling potentiation and delayed cell cycle exit of retinal progenitors. In contrast, Yap+/- adult retinas no longer exhibit TAZ-dependent dosage compensation. In this context, Yap haploinsufficiency in aged individuals results in Muller glia dysfunction, late-onset cone degeneration and reduced cone-mediated visual response. Alteration of glial homeostasis and altered patterns of cone opsins were also observed in Muller cell specific conditional Yap knockout mice. Together, this study highlights a novel YAP function in Muller cells for the maintenance of retinal tissue homeostasis and the preservation of cone integrity. It also suggests that YAP haploinsufficiency should be considered and explored as a cause of cone dystrophies in human.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/953943v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@166de41org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@898b74org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@22ad92org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b189dc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Main Points O_LIThis study finds unsuspected dynamics of YAP compensatory mechanisms in the retina of Yap+/- mice\nC_LIO_LIYap haploinsufficiency results in Muller glia dysfunction in aged mice, leading to late-onset cone dystrophy\nC_LI",

We also used FIB-SEM, a three-dimensional electron microscopy technique, to calculate the actual numbers of synapses in the same area. We then estimated the ratio between the three-dimensional densities obtained with FIB-SEM (synapses/m3) and the bi-dimensional densities obtained with SDM (puncta/100 m2). Given that it is impractical to use FIB-SEM brain-wide, we used previously available SDM data from other brain regions and we applied this ratio as a conversion factor to estimate the minimum density of synapses in those regions. We found the highest densities of synapses in the isocortex, olfactory areas, hippocampal formation and cortical subplate. Low densities were found in the pallidum, hypothalamus, brainstem and cerebellum. Finally, the striatum and thalamus showed a wide range of synapse densities.",

    "abstract": "We present a description of a system that uses a compact binary representation to describe and trace sulci on a reconstructed human cortical surface, based on a set of human-generated targets. The inputs to the system were manually created on a training set of 20 normal subjects (11 females, 9 males) with ages 22 - 40 years. T1 weighted MPRAGE images were collected on a Siemens 3T Trio scanner, with TR/TE = 2530/3.3, matrix = 256x256, FOV = 256mm, slice thickness 1.33mm. The resultant images were reconstructed with Freesurfer, and 10 sulci on each hemisphere were traced by an expert human operator and independently assessed for accuracy. Presented with these input trajectories in its training phase, the system attempted to determine a compact binary feature vector of each sulcus on each subject using as descriptor a binary parametrized function of several surface-geometry variables (such as mean curvature, sulcal depth, edge length, etc.). This function was optimized in a supervised learning fashion using a Dijkstra-based graph theory formulation, in which the binary weights were used to define graph edge costs. In the setup phase, the system was presented with sulcal trajectories already defined on surfaces, and then adjusted its parametrized weights in a binary fashion to minimize differences between the training input path and its Dijkstra-generated output path. Once the setup phase was complete and sulci had been described in a per-sulcus, per-subject manner, we generalized the per-sulcus description across all the subjects to construct a template binary word for each specific sulcus. The performance of the system for each subject and each sulcus, and for each template sulcus group was measured against the original human reference in both a quantitative and qualitative manner. Individual subjects generally showed very good optimization to their manually traced training samples across all sulci, with 91% average overlap within 4mm of the human target. Generalized group results, as expected, showed less overlap with the original human targets, but still performed on average with 80% overlap. Quantitatively, the group results were nonetheless for the most part quite acceptable to an independent human evaluator. The parametrized binary weight description that drives the Dijkstra path optimization is presented as a mechanism to succinctly and compactly describe individual human sulci and groups of sulci.",

We demonstrate that an endosomal ubiquitin ligase CARP2 associates with damaged mitochondria, and this association precedes that of Parkin. CARP2 interacts with Parkin, and stable recruitment of Parkin to damaged mitochondria was substantially reduced in CARP2 KO cells. Our study unravels a novel role of endosomes in modulating upstream pathways of Parkin-dependent mitophagy initiation.",

    "abstract": "Exon markers have a long history of use in phylogenetics of ray-finned fishes, the most diverse clade of vertebrates with more than 35,000 species. As the number of published genomes increases, it has become easier to test exons and other genetic markers for signals of ancient duplication events and filter out paralogs that can mislead phylogenetic analysis. We present seven new probe sets for current target-capture phylogenomic protocols that capture 1,104 exons explicitly filtered for paralogs using gene trees. These seven probe sets span the diversity of teleost fishes, including four sets that target five hyper-diverse percomorph clades which together comprise ca. 17,000 species (Carangaria, Ovalentaria, Eupercaria, and Syngnatharia + Pelagiaria combined). We additionally included probes to capture exon markers that have been commonly used in fish phylogenetics, despite some being flagged for paralogs, to facilitate integration of old and new molecular phylogenetic matrices. We tested these probes and merged new exon-capture sequence data into an existing data matrix of 1,105 exons and 300 ray-finned fish species. We provide an optimized bioinformatics pipeline to assemble exon capture data from raw reads to alignments for downstream analysis. We show that loci with known paralogs are at risk of assembling duplicated sequences with target-capture, but we also assembled many useful orthologous sequences. These probe sets are a valuable resource for advancing fish phylogenomics because they can be easily extracted from increasingly available whole genome and transcriptome datasets, and also may be integrated with existing PCR-based exon and mitochondrial datasets.",

    "abstract": "Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the primary causative agent of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). UPEC fitness and virulence determinants have been evaluated in a variety of laboratory settings that include a well-established mouse model of UTI. However, the extent to which bacterial physiology differs between experimental models and human infections remains largely understudied. To address this important question, we compared the transcriptomes of three different UPEC isolates in human infection and a variety of laboratory conditions including LB culture, filter-sterilized urine culture, and the UTI mouse model. We observed high correlation in gene expression between the mouse model and human infection in all three strains examined (Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.86-0.87). Only 175 of 3,266 (5.4%) genes shared by all three strains had significantly different expression levels, with the majority of them (145 genes) down-regulated in patients. Importantly, gene expression of both canonical virulence factors and metabolic machinery were highly similar between the mouse model and human infection, while the in vitro conditions displayed more substantial differences. Interestingly, comparison of gene expression between the mouse model and human infection hint at differences in bladder oxygenation as well as nutrient composition. In summary, our work strongly validates the continued use of this mouse model for the study of the pathogenesis of human UTI.\n\nImportanceDifferent experimental models have been used to study UPEC pathogenesis including in vitro cultures in different media, tissue culture, as well as mouse models of infection. The latter is especially important since it allows evaluation of mechanisms of pathogenesis and potential therapeutic strategies against UPEC. Bacterial physiology is greatly shaped by environment and it is therefore critical to understand how closely bacterial physiology in any experimental model relates to human infection. In this study, we found a very strong correlation in bacterial gene expression between the mouse model and human UTI using identical strains, suggesting that the mouse model accurately mimics human infection, definitively supporting its continued use in UTI research.",

    "abstract": "G-quadruplexes (G4), non-canonical DNA structures, are involved in several essential processes. Stabilization of G4 structures by small compounds (G4 ligands) affects almost all DNA transactions, including telomere maintenance and genomic stability. Here, thanks to a powerful and unbiased genetic approach, we identify topoisomerase 2-alpha (TOP2A) as the main effector of cell cytotoxicity induced by CX5461, a G4 ligand currently undergoing phase I/II clinical trials. This approach also allowed to identify new point mutations affecting TOP2A activity without compromising cell viability. Moreover, based on cross-resistance studies and siRNA-based protein depletion we report that TOP2A plays a major role in cell cytotoxicity induced by two unrelated clastogenic G4 ligands, CX5461 and pyridostatin (PDS). We also report that cytotoxic effects induced by both compounds are associated with topoisomerase 2-mediated DNA breaks production. Finally, we show that TOP2-mediated DNA breaks production is strongly associated with RNA Pol II-dependent transcription and is countered by topoisomerase 1 (TOP1). Altogether our results indicate that clastogenic G4 ligands act as DNA structure-driven TOP2-poisons at transcribed regions bearing G-quadruplex structures.",

We used automated training procedures to facilitate comparisons across mice. Training times varied, but most transgenic mice learned the task. Motivation levels also varied across mice. To compare mice in similar motivational states we subdivided sessions into over-, under-, and optimally motivated periods. When motivated, the pattern of perceptual decisions were highly correlated across transgenic lines, although overall d-prime was lower in one line labeling somatostatin inhibitory cells.

Several algorithms have been designed to identify the most influential regulatory points, or hub nodes, within a network. However, none of the current methods correct for inherent positional biases which limits their applicability. In addition, none of the currently available hub detection algorithms effectively combine network centrality measures together. To overcome this computational deficit, we undertook a statistical assessment of 200 real-world and simulated networks to decipher associations between centrality measures, and developed a novel algorithm termed \"integrated hubness score\" (IHS), which integrates the most important and commonly used network centrality measures, namely degree centrality, betweenness centrality and neighbourhood connectivity, in an unbiased way. When compared against the four most commonly used hub identification methods on four independent validated biological networks, the IHS algorithm outperformed all other assessed methods. Using this novel and universal method, researchers of any discipline can now identify the most influential network nodes.",

    "abstract": "Non-shivering thermogenesis occurs in brown adipose tissue to generate heat in response to cold temperatures. Thioesterase superfamily member 1 (Them1) is transcriptionally upregulated in brown adipose tissue upon cold exposure and suppresses thermogenesis to conserve energy reserves. Them1 hydrolyzes long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs, preventing their use as fuel for thermogenesis. Them1 contains a C-terminal StAR-related lipid transfer domain (StarD) with unknown ligand or function. By complementary biophysical approaches, we show that StarD binds to long-chain fatty acids, products of Them1s enzymatic reaction, as well lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which activate thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. Certain fatty acids stabilize the StarD and allosterically enhance Them1 catalysis of acyl-CoA, whereas 18:1 LPC destabilizes and inhibits activity, which we verify in cell culture. Additionally, we demonstrate that the StarD functions to localize Them1 near lipid droplets. These findings define the role of the StarD as a lipid sensor that allosterically regulates Them1 activity and localization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVitamin D exerts regulatory roles via vitamin D receptor (VDR) in mucosal immunity, host defense, and inflammation involving host factors and microbiome. Human Vdr gene variation shapes the microbiome and VDR deletion leads to dysbiosis. Low VDR expression and diminished vitamin D/VDR signaling are observed in colon cancer. Nevertheless, how intestinal epithelial VDR is involved in tumorigenesis through gut microbiota remains unknown. We hypothesized that intestinal VDR protects mice against dysbiosis via modulating the JAK/STAT pathway in tumorigenesis. To test our hypothesis, we used an azoxymethane/Dextran Sulfate Sodium-induced cancer model in intestinal VDR conditional knockout (VDR{Delta}IEC) mice, cell cultures, stem-cell derived colonoids, and human colon cancer samples.\n\nResultsVDR{Delta}IEC mice have higher numbers of tumors with location shifted from distal to proximal colon. Fecal microbiota analysis showed that VDR deletion leads to bacterial profile shift from normal to susceptible carcinogenesis. We found enhanced bacterial staining in mouse and human tumors. Microbial metabolites from VDR{Delta}IEC mice showed elevated secondary bile acids, consistent with the observations in human CRC. We further identified that VDR protein bound to the Jak2 promoter, suggesting that VDR transcriptionally regulated Jak2. The JAK/STAT pathway is critical in intestinal and microbial homeostasis. Fecal samples from VDR{Delta}IEC mice activate the STAT3 activation in human and mouse organoids. Lack of VDR led to hyperfunction of Jak2 in respond to intestinal dysbiosis. A JAK/STAT inhibitor abolished the microbiome-induced activation of STAT3.\n\nConclusionWe provide insights into the mechanism of VDR dysfunction leading to dysbiosis and tumorigenesis. It indicates a new target -- microbiome and VDR for prevention of cancer.",

    "abstract": "A goal of the genomic era is to infer the evolutionary dynamics at play during the process of speciation by analysing the genomic landscape of divergence. However, empirical assessments of genomic landscapes under varying evolutionary scenarios are few, limiting the ability to achieve this goal. Here we combine RAD-sequencing and individual-based simulations to evaluate the genomic landscape in the silvereye (Zosterops lateralis). Using comparisons matched for divergence timeframe and gene flow context, we document how genomic patterns accumulate along the speciation continuum. In contrast to previous predictions, our results provide limited support for the idea that divergence accumulates around loci under divergent selection or that genomic islands widen with time. While a small number of genomic islands were found in populations diverging with and without gene flow, in few cases were SNPs putatively under selection tightly associated with genomic islands. Furthermore, we modelled the transition from localised to genome-wide levels of divergence using individual-based simulations that considered only neutral processes. Our results challenge the ubiquity of existing verbal models that explain the accumulation of genomic differences across the speciation continuum and instead support the idea that divergence both within and outside of genomic islands is important during the speciation process.\n\nDATA ACCESSION NUMBERSResequencing data from this study have been submitted to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) under accession number PRJNA489169.",

LRR-RKs can sense small molecule, peptide or protein ligands, and may be activated by ligand-induced interaction with a shape complementary SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) co-receptor kinase. We have previously shown that SERKs can also form constitutive, ligand-independent complexes with the LRR ectodomains of BAK1-interacting receptor-like kinase 3 (BIR3) receptor pseudokinases, negative regulators of LRR-RK signaling. Here we report that receptor chimaera in which the extracellular LRR domain of BIR3 is fused to the cytoplasmic kinase domains of the SERK-dependent LRR-RKs BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1, HAESA and ERECTA form tight complexes with endogenous SERK co-receptors in the absence of ligand stimulus. Expression of these chimaera under the control of the endogenous promoter of the respective LRR-RK leads to strong gain-of-function brassinosteroid, floral abscission and stomatal patterning phenotypes, respectively. Importantly, a BIR3-GSO1/SGN3 chimera can partially complement sgn3 Casparian strip formation phenotypes, suggesting that GSO1/SGN3 receptor activation is also mediated by SERK proteins.

Here we investigate genome-scale chromatin remodeling in response to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) oncometabolite using single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin with sequencing (scATAC-seq). We find that 2HG enantiomers differentially disrupt exquisite control of epigenome integrity by limiting -ketoglutarate (KG)-dependent DNA and histone demethylation, while enhanced cell-to-cell variability in the chromatin regulatory landscape is most evident upon exposure to L2HG enantiomer. Despite the highly heterogeneous responses, 2HG largely recapitulates two prominent hallmarks of the breast cancer epigenome, i.e., global loss of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) and promoter hypermethylation, particularly at tumor suppressor genes involved in DNA damage repair and checkpoint control. Single-cell mass cytometry further demonstrates downregulation of BRCA1, MSH2 and MLH1 in 2HG-responsive subpopulations, along with acute reversal of chromatin remodeling upon withdrawal.

To date, the neurobiological basis of these deficits remains elusive. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, 17 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, and 18 matched controls watched videos of an actor speaking, gesturing (unimodal), and both speaking and gesturing (bimodal) about social or non-social events in a naturalistic way. Participants were asked to judge whether each video contains person-related (social) or object-related (non-social) information. When processing social-abstract content, patients showed reduced activation in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) only in the gesture but not in the speech condition. For non-social-concrete content, remarkably, reduced neural activation for patients in the left postcentral gyrus and the right insula was observed only in the speech condition. Moreover, in the bimodal conditions, patients displayed improved task performance and comparable activation to controls in both social and non-social content. To conclude, patients with schizophrenia displayed modality-specific aberrant neural processing of social and non-social information, which is not present for the bimodal conditions. This finding provides novel insights into dysfunctional multimodal communication in schizophrenia, and may have potential therapeutic implications.",

The divergence of S. baicalensis and S. barbata occurred far earlier than previously reported, and a whole-genome duplication event was identified.

The comparative genome analysis of congeneric species elucidated the species-specific evolution of chrysin and apigenin biosynthetic genes, such as the S. baicalensis-specific tandem duplication of the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and chalcone synthase (CHS) genes, and the S. barbata-specific duplication of 4-CoA ligase (4CL) genes. In addition, the paralogous duplication, collinearity, and expression diversity of CYP82D subfamily members revealed the functional divergence of flavone hydroxylase genes between S. baicalensis and S. barbata.

    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications play an essential role in chromatin architecture and dynamics. The role of epigenetic modification in chromatin organization has been studied by Hi-C from population cells, but imaging techniques to study their correlation and regulation in single living cells are lacking. Here we develop a CRISPR-based EpiGo (Epigenetic perturbation induced Genome organization) system to track epigenetic modification-mediated relocation, interaction or reorganization of genomic regions in living cells. EpiGo-KRAB is sufficient to induce the relocation of genomic loci to HP1 condensates and trigger genomic interactions. EpiGo-KRAB also triggers the induction of H3K9me3 at large genomic regions, which decorate on the surface of HP1 condensates possibly driven by phase separation.",

    "abstract": "Latent sensitization is a long-term model of chronic pain in which hyperalgesia is continuously suppressed by opioid receptors. This is demonstrated by the induction of mechanical allodynia by opioid antagonists. Different intracellular signals may mediate the initiation, maintenance and expression of latent sensitization. Our criterion for the involvement of a signal in the maintenance of latent sensitization is that it inhibitors should permanently eliminate the allodynia produced by an opioid antagonist. We hypothesized that Src family kinases (SFKs) maintain latent sensitization and tested this hypothesis in rats with latent sensitization induced by complete Freunds adjuvant (CFA) or by spared nerve injury. After measures of mechanical allodynia returned to baseline, the SFK inhibitor PP2 or vehicle were injected intrathecally. The opioid antagonist naltrexone injected intrathecally 15 min later produced allodynia in control rats but not in rats injected with PP2. PP2 or vehicle were injected daily for two more days and naltrexone was injected five days later. Again, naltrexone induced allodynia in the control rats but not in the rats injected with PP2. Results were similar when latent sensitization was induced either with CFA or spared nerve injury. We concluded that an SFK, likely Fyn, maintains latent sensitization induced by inflammation or nerve injury.\n\nPerspectiveThis article presents evidence that a Src family kinase, likely Fyn, maintains latent sensitization induced by inflammation or nerve injury. If latent sensitization is a valid model of chronic pain, inhibiting its maintenance with Src family kinase inhibitors may cure chronic pain.",

    "abstract": "Pigs are an important translational research model for biomedical imaging studies, and especially for modeling diseases of the liver. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MRI is experimentally used to measure liver function in humans, but has never been characterized in pig liver. Here we performed DCE-MRI of pig liver following the delivery of two FDA approved hepato-specific MRI contrast agents, Gd-EOB-DTPA (Eovist) and Gd-BOPTA (Multihance), and the non-hepatospecific agent Magnevist, and optimized the anesthesia and animal handling protocol to acquire robust data. A single pig underwent 5 scanning sessions over six weeks, each time injected at clinical dosing either with Eovist (twice), Multihance (twice) or Magnevist (once). DCE-MRI was performed at 1.5T for 60 minutes. DCE-MRI showed rapid hepatic MRI signal enhancement following IV injection of Eovist or Multihance. Efflux of contrast agent from liver exhibited kinetics similar to that in humans, except for one hyperthermic animal where efflux was very fast. As expected, Magnevist was non-enhancing in the liver. The hepatic signal enhancement from Eovist matched that seen in humans and primates, while the hepatic signal enhancement from Multihance was different, similar to rodents and dogs, likely the result of differential hepatic organic anion transport polypeptides. This first experience with these agents in pigs provides valuable information on contrast agent dynamics in normal pig liver. Given the disparity in contrast agent uptake kinetics with humans for Multihance, Eovist should be used in porcine models for biomedical imaging. Proper animal health maintenance, especially temperature, seems essential for accurate and reproducible results.",

    "abstract": "Backgrounds & AimsAs the bile acid (BA) pool composition is of major impact on liver pathophysiology, we studied its regulation by the BA receptor TGR5, promoting hepatoprotection against BA overload.\n\nMethodsWT, total and hepato-specific TGR5-KO, and TGR5-overexpressing mice were used in: partial and 90% extended hepatectomies (EH) upon normal, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)- or cholestyramine (CT)-enriched diet, bile duct ligation (BDL), cholic acid (1%)-enriched diet, and TGR5 agonist (RO) treatments. We thereby studied TGR5 impact on: BA pool composition, liver injury, regeneration and survival. Particular focus was made on gut microbiota (GM) and gallbladder (GB) function analysis. BA pool composition was analyzed in patients undergoing major hepatectomy.\n\nResultsThe TGR5-KO hyperhydrophobic BA pool was not related to BA synthesis alteration, nor to the TGR5-KO GM dysbiosis, as supported by hepatocyte-specific KO mice and cohousing experiments. The TGR5-dependent control of GB dilatation was crucial for BA pool composition, as determined by experiments including RO treatment +/- cholecystectomy. The poor TGR5-KO post-EH survival rate, related with exacerbated peribiliary necrosis and BA overload, was improved by shifting the BA pool towards a more hydrophilic composition (CT and UDCA treatments). After either BDL or CA-enriched diet +/- cholecystectomy, we found that GB dilatation had strong TGR5-dependent hepatoprotective properties. In patients, a more hydrophobic BA pool was correlated with an unfavorable outcome after hepatectomy.\n\nConclusionBA pool composition is crucial for hepatoprotection in mice and humans. We point TGR5 as a key regulator of BA profile and thereby as a potential hepatoprotective target under BA overload conditions.\n\nLay summaryThrough multiple in vivo experimental approaches in mice, together with a patients study, this work brings some new light on the relationships between biliary homeostasis, gallbladder function and liver protection. We showed that the bile acid pool composition is crucial for optimal liver repair, not only in mice but also in human patients undergoing major hepatectomy.",

COM1 specifies branch-inhibition in Triticeae (barley) versus branch-formation in non-Triticeae grasses. Analyses of cell size, cell walls and transcripts revealed barley COM1 regulates cell growth, affecting cell wall properties and signaling specifically in meristematic boundaries to establish identity of adjacent meristems. COM1 acts upstream of the boundary gene Liguleless1 and confers meristem identity partially independent of the COM2 pathway. Furthermore, COM1 is subject to purifying natural selection, thereby contributing to specification of the spike inflorescence shape. This meristem identity pathway has conceptual implications for both inflorescence evolution and molecular breeding in Triticeae.",

We report here that TERT directly binds to the TCF binding elements (TBE) located upstream the oncomiR MIR500A inducing its expression and promoting cancer invasiveness. This function is independent of telomerase activity, since catalytic inactive TERT also induces MIR500A expression and telomerase inhibitors directed against TERT, but not to its RNA component TERC, inhibit telomerase-induced MIR500A expression and cancer invasiveness. Mechanistically, telomerase-induced MIR500A down-regulates key genes of the Hedgehog signaling pathway, namely patched 1 (PTCH1), Gli family zinc finger 3 (GLI3) and cullin 3 (CUL3), increasing tumor invasiveness.

This turns out to be closely related to the ratio of realized species diversity to the number of resources. This ratio is set by competition, through the balance between species being pushed out and invading. When this ratio is smaller than one, dynamics will reach stable equilibria. When this ratio is larger than one, fixed-points are either unstable or marginally stable, as expected by the competitive exclusion principle. If they are unstable, the system is repelled from fixed points, and abundances forever fluctuate. While marginally-stable fixed points are in principle allowed and predicted by some models, they become structurally unstable at high diversity. This means that even small changes to the model, such as non-linearities in how resources combine to generate species growth, will result in persistent abundance fluctuations.",

    "abstract": "Human observers can reliably report their confidence in the choices they make. An influential framework conceptualizes decision confidence as the probability of a decision being correct, given the choice made and the evidence on which it was based. This framework accounts for three diagnostic signatures of human confidence reports, including an opposite dependence of confidence on evidence strength for correct and error trials. However, the framework does not account for the temporal evolution of these signatures, because it only describes the transformation of a static representation of evidence into choice and the associated confidence. Here, we combine this framework with another influential framework: dynamic accumulation of evidence over time, and build on the notion that confidence reflects the probability of being correct, given the choice and accumulated evidence up until that point. Critically, we show that such a dynamic model predicts that the diagnostic signatures of confidence depend on time; most critically, it predicts a stronger opposite dependence of confidence on evidence strength and choice correctness as a function of time. We tested, and confirmed, these predictions in human behaviour during random dot motion discrimination, in which confidence judgments were queried at different points in time. We conclude that human confidence reports reflect the dynamics of the probability of being correct given the accumulated evidence and choice.",

    "abstract": "RNA knockdown in vivo carries significant potential for disease modelings and therapies. Despite the emerging approaches of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated permanent knock out of targeted genes, strategies targeting RNA for disruption are advantageous in the treatment of acquired metabolic disorders when permanent modification of the genome DNA is not appropriate, and RNA virus infection diseases when pathogenic DNA is not available (such as SARS-Cov-2 and MERS infections). Recently, Cas13d, a family of RNA-targeting CRISPR effectors, has been shown to accomplish robust down-regulation of cellular RNAs in mammalian cells in vitro. Among the various Cas13d subtypes, CasRx (RfxCas13d) showed the most potent RNA knockdown efficiency in HEK293T cells. However, the RNA-targeting activity of Cas13d still needs to be verified in vivo. In this study, the CasRx system was demonstrated to efficiently and functionally knock down genes related to metabolism functions, including Pten, Pcsk9 and lncLstr, in mouse hepatocytes. CasRx-mediated simultaneous knockdown of multiple genes was also achieved by sgRNA arrays, providing a useful strategy to modulate complex metabolism networks. Moreover, the AAV (adeno-associated virus)-mediated delivery of CasRx and Pcsk9 sgRNAs into mouse liver successfully decreased serum PCSK9, resulting in significant reduction of serum cholesterol levels. Importantly, CasRx-mediated knockdown of Pcsk9 is reversible and Pcsk9 could be repeatedly down-regulated, providing an effective strategy to reversibly modulate metabolic genes. The present work supplies a successful proof-of-concept trial that suggests efficient and regulatory knockdown of target metabolic genes for a designed metabolism modulation in the liver.",

    "abstract": "Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) is a major biothreat agent that naturally causes outbreaks in humans and horses particularly in tropical areas of the western hemisphere, for which no antiviral therapy is currently available. The host response to VEEV and the cellular factors this alphavirus hijacks to support its effective replication or evade cellular immune responses are largely uncharacterized. We have previously demonstrated tremendous cell-to-cell heterogeneity in viral RNA (vRNA) and cellular transcript levels during flaviviral infection using a novel virus-inclusive single-cell RNA-Seq approach. Here, we used this unbiased, genome-wide approach to simultaneously profile the host transcriptome and vRNA in thousands of single cells during infection of human astrocytes with the live-attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV (TC-83). Host transcription was profoundly suppressed, yet \"superproducer cells\" with extremely high vRNA abundance emerged during the first viral life cycle and demonstrated an altered transcriptome relative to both uninfected cells and cells with high vRNA abundance harvested at later time points. Additionally, cells with increased structural-to-nonstructural transcript ratio exhibited upregulation of intracellular membrane trafficking genes at later time points. Loss- and gain-of-function experiments confirmed pro- and antiviral activities in both vaccine and virulent VEEV infections among the products of transcripts that positively or negatively correlated with vRNA abundance, respectively. Lastly, comparison with single cell transcriptomic data from other viruses highlighted common and unique pathways perturbed by infection across evolutionary scales. This study provides a high-resolution characterization of the VEEV (TC-83)-host interplay, identifies candidate targets for antivirals, and establishes a comparative single-cell approach to study the evolution of virus-host interactions.\n\nAuthor SummaryLittle is known about the host response to Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis Virus (VEEV) and the cellular factors this alphavirus hijacks to support effective replication or evade cellular immune responses. Monitoring dynamics of host and viral RNA (vRNA) during viral infection at a single-cell level can provide insight into the virus-host interplay at a high resolution. Here, a single-cell RNA sequencing technology that detects host and viral RNA was used to investigate the interactions between TC-83, the vaccine strain of VEEV, with the human host during the course of infection of U-87 MG cells (human astrocytoma). Virus abundance and host transcriptome were heterogeneous across cells from the same culture. Subsets of differentially expressed genes, positively or negatively correlating with vRNA abundance, were identified and subsequently in vitro validated as candidate proviral and antiviral factors, respectively, in TC-83 and/or virulent VEEV infections. In the first replication cycle, \"superproducer\" cells exhibited rapid increase in vRNA abundance and unique gene expression patterns. At later time points, cells with increased structural-to-nonstructural transcript ratio demonstrated upregulation of intracellular membrane trafficking genes. Lastly, comparing the VEEV dataset with published datasets on other RNA viruses revealed unique and overlapping responses across viral clades. Overall, this study improves the understanding of VEEV-host interactions, reveals candidate targets for antiviral approaches, and establishes a comparative single-cell approach to study the evolution of virus-host interactions.",

    "abstract": "The essential biological cofactor heme is synthesized in cells in the Fe(II) form. Oxidized Fe(III) heme is specifically required for processing primary transcripts of microRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by the RNA-binding protein DGCR8, a core component of the Microprocessor complex. It is unknown how readily available Fe(III) heme is in the largely reducing environment in human cells and how changes in cellular Fe(III) heme availability alter microRNA (miRNA) expression. Here we address the first question by characterizing DGCR8 mutants with various degrees of deficiency in heme-binding. We observed a strikingly simple correlation between Fe(III) heme affinity in vitro and the Microprocessor activity in HeLa cells, with the heme affinity threshold for activation estimated to be between 0.6-5 pM under typical cell culture conditions. The threshold is strongly influenced by cellular heme synthesis and uptake. We suggest that the threshold reflects a labile Fe(III) heme pool in cells. Based on our understanding of DGCR8 mutants, we reanalyzed recently reported miRNA sequencing data and conclude that heme is generally required for processing canonical pri-miRNAs, that heme modulates the specificity of Microprocessor, and that cellular heme level and differential DGCR8 heme occupancy alter the expression of distinct groups of miRNAs in a hierarchical fashion. Overall, our study provides the first glimpse of a labile Fe(III) heme pool important for a fundamental physiological function and reveal principles governing how Fe(III) heme modulates miRNA maturation at a genomic scale. We also discuss potential states and biological significance of the labile Fe(III) heme pool.",

    "abstract": "The epigenome defines the cell type, but also shows plasticity that enables cells to tune their gene expression potential to the context of extracellular cues. This is evident in immune sentinel cells such as macrophages, which can respond to pathogens and cytokines with phenotypic shifts that are driven by epigenomic reprogramming1. Recent studies indicate that this reprogramming arises from the activity of transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF{kappa}B), which binds not only to available enhancers but may produce de novo enhancers in previously silent areas of the genome2. Here, we show that NF{kappa}B reprograms the macrophage epigenome in a stimulus-specific manner, in response only to a subset of pathogen-derived stimuli. The basis for these surprising differences lies in the stimulus-specific temporal dynamics of NF{kappa}B activity. Testing predictions of a mathematical model of nucleosome interactions, we demonstrate through live cell imaging and genetic perturbations that NF{kappa}B promotes open chromatin and formation of de novo enhancers most strongly when its activity is non-oscillatory. These de novo enhancers result in the activation of additional response genes. Our study demonstrates that the temporal dynamics of NF{kappa}B activity, which encode ligand identity3, can be decoded by the epigenome through de novo enhancer formation. We propose a mechanistic paradigm in which the temporal dynamics of transcription factors are a key determinant of their capacity to control epigenomic reprogramming, thus enabling the formation of stimulus-specific memory in innate immune sentinel cells.",

    "abstract": "Upon target RNA recognition, type III CRISPR-Cas systems produce cyclic oligoadenylate second messengers to activate downstream effectors including Csm6-family ribonucleases via their CARF domains. Here we show that Enteroccocus italicus Csm6 (EiCsm6) degrades its cognate cyclic hexa-AMP (cA6) activator and report the crystal structure of EiCsm6 bound to a cA6 mimic. The structure, combined with biochemical and in vivo functional assays, reveal how cA6 recognition by the CARF domain activates the Csm6 HEPN domains for collateral RNA degradation, and how CARF domain-mediated cA6 cleavage provides an intrinsic off-switch to limit Csm6 activity in the absence of ring nucleases. These mechanisms facilitate rapid invader clearance and ensure termination of CRISPR interference to limit self-toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the study was to analyse the structure of the population, kinship coefficients and inbreeding trend taking into account the sex, breeding system: champions (CH) and non-champions (nCH), breeding country: Poland (PL) and foreign country (Z) and the inbreeding degree of Tatra Shepherd dogs. Out of the currently registered 587 Tatra Shepherd dogs, 41.9% have been qualified for breeding. In the past decade, 1961 puppies were born, which corresponds to an average litter of 5.8 puppies. The breeds inbreeding rate amounted to 6.34%, and for a 4-generation population was 6.68%. The highest inbreeding rate was found in nCH and PL groups consisting of both male and female dogs. The inbreeding rate was significantly higher in 2005-2014 compared to the years 1994-2004. The limit value FX was exceeded for 25.65% of Shepherd dogs, and the critical value was exceeded for 11.52%. An increasing ancestor loss coefficient (AVK) was found, which may result in an increased number of inbred animals. In particular, it referred to female dogs in the nCH, PL, and F group, whereas a significant increase of AVK was observed in the group of male dogs from foreign kennels. The resulting COR values, respectively 55.58% for males and 55.44% for females, testify to insignificant inbreeding and suggest that breeders look for male inbreds. Studies have shown that there is no risk of inbred depression yet; however, the gene pool of the Tatra Shepherd dog breed has become noticeably restricted. In addition, leaving the stud book for the breed open must be considered due to an increase in the popularity of the breed, and thus an increase in mating.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) represents a global public health threat and is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Effective control of TB is complicated with the emergence of multidrug resistance. Yet, there is still a fundamental gap in understanding the complex and dynamic interactions between different Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and the host. In this project, we investigated the host immune response to different M. tuberculosis strains, including avirulent or virulent and rifampin-resistant or isoniazid-resistant strains in THP-1 cells. We identified major differences in the gene response profiles in response to infection with these strains. The expression of IDO1 and IL-1{beta} in the infected cells was stronger in all virulent M. tuberculosis strains. The most striking result was the overexpression of many interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in cells infected with the isoniazid-resistant strain, compared to the rifampin-drug resistant strain and the drug-sensitive strain. A transcription regulation analysis of the differentially expressed genes in infected THP-1 cells implicated two major transcription factors, NF-{kappa}B and STAT1. The differentially expressed ISGs in response to the isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis strain were associated with STAT1 signaling, while the expression of many cytokines, such IL-1{beta}, was associated with NF-{kappa}B signaling. Our data suggest that the isoniazid-resistant M. tuberculosis strain preferentially activates STAT1 in response to cGAS-STING activation and induces a host immune response signature that is characteristic of isoniazid resistance. This study has a potential to provide important new insights into TB pathogenesis and to characterize host gene signatures specifically involved in isoniazid-resistant TB.",

    "abstract": "Cataglyphis ants are known for their outstanding navigational abilities. They return to their inconspicuous nest after far-reaching foraging trips using path integration, and whenever available, learn and memorize visual features of panoramic sceneries. To achieve this, the ants combine directional visual information from celestial cues and panoramic scenes with distance information from an intrinsic odometer. The largely vision-based navigation in Cataglyphis requires sophisticated neuronal networks to process the broad repertoire of visual stimuli. Although Cataglyphis ants have been subject to many neuroethological studies, little is known about the general neuronal organization of their central brain and the visual pathways beyond major circuits. Here, we provide a comprehensive, three-dimensional neuronal map of synapse-rich neuropils in the brain of Cataglyphis nodus including major connecting fiber systems. In addition, we examined neuronal tracts underlying the processing of visual information in more detail. This study revealed a total of 33 brain neuropils and 30 neuronal fiber tracts including six distinct tracts between the optic lobes and the cerebrum. We also discuss the importance of comparative studies on insect brain architecture for a profound understanding of neuronal networks and their function.",

    "abstract": "Crop diversification is a promising climate change adaptation strategy for food production stability. However, without quantitative assessments of where, with which crop mixes and to what extent diversification is possible now and under future climatic conditions, efforts to expand crop diversification under Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Action Plans (NAP) are unsystematic. In this study, we used extreme gradient boosting, a machine learning approach to model the current climatic suitability for maize, sorghum, cassava and groundnut in Ghana using yield data and agronomically important variables. We then used multi-model future climate projections for the 2050s and two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) to predict changes in the suitability range of these crops. We achieved a good model fit in determining suitability classes for all crops (AUC=0.81-0.87). Precipitation-based factors are suggested as most important in determining crop suitability, though the importance is crop-specific. Under projected climatic conditions, optimal suitability areas will decrease for all crops except for groundnuts under RCP8.5 (no change: 0%), with greatest losses for maize (12% under RCP2.6 and 14% under RCP8.5). Under current climatic conditions, 18% of Ghana has optimal suitability for two crops, 2% for three crops with no area having optimal suitability for all the four crops. Under projected climatic conditions, areas with optimal suitability for producing two and three crops will decrease by 12% as areas having moderate and marginal conditions for multiple crops increase. We also found that although diversification opportunities are spatially distinct, cassava and groundnut will be more simultaneously suitable for the south while groundnut and sorghum will be more suitable for the northern parts of Ghana under projected climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Aerobic composting is a sustainable method for recycling of chicken manure, while its unsuitable porosity and carbon to nitrogen ratio limit the oxygen supply, which must result in high nitrogen loss because of anaerobic micro-zones in the materials. Treatments with five carbon-based additives and two ventilation rates (0.18 and 0.36 L{middle dot}min-1{middle dot}kg-1 DM) were set in chicken manure composting, to investigate their effects on biodegradation process, ammonia (NH3) emission, nitrogen loss, physiochemical properties and microbial community. The additives and ventilation rates influenced the CO2 production from the 2nd week, meanwhile varied the physiochemical parameters all the process. No inhibitory effect on the maturity were observed in all treatments. With woody peat as additive, the NH3 emission amount and nitrogen loss rate were shown as 15.86 mg and 4.02 %, when compared with 31.08-80.13 mg and 24.26-34.24 % in other treatments. The high aeration rate increased the NH3 emission and nitrogen loss, which were varied with different additives. The T-RFLP results showed that the additives and the ventilation rates changed the microbial community, while the prominent microbial clones belonged to the class of Bacilli and Clostridia (in the phylum of Firmicutes), and Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria (in the phylum of Proteobacteria). Bacillus spp. was observed to be the most dominant bacteria in all the composting stages and treatments. We concluded that woody peat could improve chicken manure composting more than other additives, especially on controlling nitrogen loss. 0.18 L{middle dot}min-1{middle dot}kg-1 DM was suitable for chicken manure composting with different additives.",

    "abstract": "During blood stage development, malaria parasites are challenged with the detoxification of enormous amounts of haem released during the proteolytic catabolism of erythrocytic haemoglobin. They tackle this problem by sequestering haem into bioinert crystals known as haemozoin. The mechanisms underlying this biomineralization process remain enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that both rodent and human malaria parasite species secrete and internalize a lipocalin-like protein, PV5, to control haem crystallization. Transcriptional deregulation of PV5 in the rodent parasite Plasmodium berghei results in inordinate elongation of haemozoin crystals, while conditional PV5 inactivation in the human malaria agent Plasmodium falciparum causes excessive multi-directional crystal branching. Although haemoglobin processing remains unaffected, PV5-deficient parasites generate less haemozoin. Electron diffraction analysis indicates that despite the distinct changes in crystal morphology neither the crystalline order nor unit cell of haemozoin are affected by impaired PV5 function. Deregulation of PV5 expression renders P. berghei hypersensitive to the antimalarial drugs artesunate, chloroquine, and atovaquone, resulting in accelerated parasite clearance following drug treatment in vivo. Together, our findings demonstrate the Plasmodium-tailored role of a lipocalin family member in haemozoin formation and underscore the haem biomineralization pathway as an attractive target for therapeutic exploitation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEDuring blood stage development, the malaria parasite replicates inside erythrocytes of the vertebrate host, where it engulfs and digests most of the available haemoglobin. This results in release of the oxygen-binding prosthetic group haem, which is highly toxic in its unbound form. The parasite crystallizes the haem into an insoluble pigment called haemozoin, a process that is vital for parasite survival and which is exploited in antimalarial therapy. We demonstrate that the parasite uses a protein called PV5 in haemozoin formation and that interfering with PV5 expression can increase the parasites sensitivity to antimalarial drugs during blood infection. An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying haem sequestration will provide valuable insights for future drug development efforts.",
