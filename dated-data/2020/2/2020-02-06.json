    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that latently infects hematopoietic cells and has the ability to reactivate when triggered by immunological stress. This reactivation causes significant morbidity and mortality in immune-deficient patients, who are unable to control viral dissemination. While a competent immune system helps prevent clinically detectable viremia, a portrait of the factors that induce reactivation following the proper cues remains incomplete. Our understanding of the complex molecular mechanisms underlying latency and reactivation continue to evolve. We previously showed the HCMV-encoded G-protein coupled receptor US28 is expressed during latency and facilitates latent infection by attenuating the activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor subunit, c-fos, expression and activity. We now show AP-1 is a critical component for HCMV reactivation. Pharmacological inhibition of c-fos significantly attenuates viral reactivation. In agreement, infection with a virus in which we disrupted the proximal AP-1 binding site in the major immediate early (MIE) enhancer results in inefficient reactivation compared to wild type. Concomitantly, AP-1 recruitment to the MIE enhancer is significantly decreased following reactivation of the mutant virus. Further, AP-1 is critical for de-repression of MIE-driven transcripts and downstream early and late genes, while immediate early genes from other loci remain unaffected. Our data also reveal MIE transcripts driven from the MIE promoter, the distal promoter, and the internal promoter, iP2, are dependent upon AP-1 recruitment, while iP1-driven transcripts are AP-1-independent. Collectively, our data demonstrate AP-1 binding to and activation of the MIE enhancer is a key molecular process controlling reactivation from latency.\n\nSignificance StatementHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common pathogen that infects the majority of the population for life. This infection poses little threat in immunologically healthy individuals, but can be fatal in people with compromised immune systems. Our understanding of the mechanisms underlying latency and reactivation remains incomplete. Here, we show the cellular transcription factor, AP-1, is a key to regulating HCMV reactivation. Our findings reveal AP-1 binding to the major immediate early enhancer/promoter is critical for switching this locus from one that is repressed during latency to one that is highly active following reactivation. Our work provides a novel mechanism HCMV exploits to reactivate, highlighting AP-1 as a potential target to prevent HCMV reactivation.",

They are traditionally found to be involved in primary metabolism, where they act as electron transporters, but specialized isoprenoid quinones are also produced by all domains of life. Here, we report the engineering of a bakers yeast strain, Saccharomyces cerevisiae EPYFA3, for the production of isoprenoid quinones. Our yeast strain was developed through overexpression of the shikimate pathway in a well-established recipient strain (S. cerevisiae EPY300) where the mevalonate pathway is overexpressed. As a proof of concept, our new host strain was used to overproduce the endogenous isoprenoid quinone coenzyme Q6, resulting in a final four-fold production increase. EPYFA3 represents a valuable platform for the heterologous production of high value isoprenoid quinones. EPYFA3 will also facilitate the elucidation of isoprenoid quinone biosynthetic pathways.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=67 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/932020v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dcb86borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf9a11org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18c00aaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7fd429_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Additionally the UP element dyad symmetry suggests that the two polymerase  subunits, which bind to the UPs, should have two-fold dyad axis of symmetry on the polymerase and this is indeed observed in an X-ray crystal structure. Curiously the CTDs should compete for overlapping UP elements. In vitro experiments confirm that{sigma} 38 recognizes the rrnB P1 promoter, requires a -10, UP elements and no -35.

    "abstract": "Peri-event time histograms (PETH) are widely used to study correlations between experimental events and neuronal firing. The accuracy of firing rate estimate using a PETH depends on the choice of binsize. We show that the optimal binsize for a PETH depends on factors such as the number of trials and the temporal dynamics of the firing rate. These factors argue against the use of a one-size-fits-all binsize when making PETHs for an inhomogeneous population of neurons. Here we propose a binsize selection method by adapting the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Simulations show that optimal binsizes estimated by AIC closely match the optimal binsizes using mean squared error (MSE). Furthermore, using real data, we find that optimal binning improves detection of responses and their dynamics. Together our analysis strongly supports optimal binning of PETHs and proposes a computationally efficient method for this optimization based on AIC approach to model selection.",

    "abstract": "Placenta-mediated pregnancy complications are a major challenge in the management of maternal-fetal health. Maternal thrombophilia is a suspected risk factor but the role of thrombotic processes in these complications and the potential for antithrombotic treatment have remained unclear. Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR) is an anticoagulant protein highly expressed in the placenta. EPCR autoantibodies and specific gene variants of EPCR are associated with poor pregnancy outcomes. In mice, fetal EPCR deficiency results in placental failure and in utero death. Adult EPCR-deficient mice generated by maintaining placental expression exhibit plasma markers of thrombophilia without overt thrombosis. We demonstrate that inactivation of clotting factor VIII or Protease Activated Receptor 4 (Par4), Par3 or integrin IIb in the mother allows placental development and intrauterine survival of murine embryos lacking EPCR. Rescued EPCR-deficient embryos exhibit thrombosis in placental venous sinuses at late gestation and a high rate of neonatal lethality. In contrast to fetal EPCR deficiency, maternal deficiency of EPCR results in frequent stillbirths and maternal death accompanied by pathological findings that resemble placental abruption and consumptive coagulopathy. Inactivation of Par4, but not clotting factor VIII, prevents maternal death and restores normal pregnancy outcomes. These observations establish a cause-effect relationship between maternal thrombophilia and placental abruption. They demonstrate that sites of uteroplacental thrombosis and the potential response to antithrombotic intervention may differ with gestational age and maternal versus fetal origin of thrombophilia. Our findings highlight the potential for therapeutic inhibition of thrombin-mediated platelet activation in a subset of pregnancy complications.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LIMurine model establishes a cause-effect relationship between maternal thrombophilia, retroplacental hemorrhage and severe pregnancy complications.\nC_LIO_LIThrombin-mediated activation of maternal platelets is a key event in thrombophilia-associated pregnancy complications and a potential target of therapeutic intervention.\nC_LIO_LIMaternal venous channels in uteroplacental circulation are additional sites of thrombotic pathology associated with adverse neonatal outcomes.\nC_LI",

At1g77960 transcripts accumulate to very high levels in plants ectopically overexpressing the Golden2-like1 (GLK1) transcription factor and is designated as a Response to GLK1 Overexpression (RGO) gene. RGO encodes a protein with domains of tandem QH and QN repeats. Transcripts and promoter GUS reporter analyses indicated that RGO is expressed in roots, leaves, stems, floral and siliques tissues but not in seeds. Expression of the RGO:YFP fusion protein demonstrated that RGO is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum. MicroRNA mediated silencing of RGO resulted in severe reductions in vegetative and root growth, delayed flowering and reduced seed yield and viability, suggesting that RGO is essential for plant development. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of RGO resulted in enhanced vegetative growth including increased axillary bud formation and a 20% higher seed yield. Stable overexpression of RGO in Brassica napus also produced a similar increase in seed yield. Cytokinin (CK) response assays including root growth, green calli formation from excised hypocotyls and chlorophyll retention during dark-induced senescence suggest that one role of RGO is to mediate CK responses in plant development. These results suggest that RGO could be a target gene for increasing crop seed yields.\n\nOne-sentence summaryRGO, a novel gene from Arabidopsis, is essential for plant development, mediates CK signaling and increases seed yield in Arabidopsis and rapeseed when overexpressed.",

Due to its sustainability, such induced resistance is highly valuable for disease management in agriculture. Here we study an example of resistance against wheat-leaf rust induced by Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 (CHA0) and {beta}-aminobutyric acid (BABA), respectively. Seed dressing with CHA0 reduced the number of sporulating pustules on the leaves and the expression of resistance was visible as necrotic or chlorotic flecks. Moreover, a beneficial effect of CHA0 on growth was observed in wheat seedlings challenged or not with leaf rust. BABA was tested at 10, 15 and 20 mM and a dose-dependent reduction of leaf rust infection was observed with the highest level of protection at 20 mM. However, BABA treatment repressed plant growth at 20 mM. Balancing between BABA-impact on plant growth and its protective capacity, we selected 15 mM as suitable concentration to protect wheat seedlings against leaf rust with the least impact on vegetative growth. To understand the mechanisms behind the observed resistance, we have studied the histological aspects of the fungal infection process. Our results showed that the p re-entry process was not affected by the two resistance inducers. However, both treatments reduced fungal penetration and haustoria formation. The timing and the amplitude of the resistance reactions was different after bacterial or chemical induction, leading to different levels of resistance to leaf rust. During fungal colonization of the tissues, a high deposition of callose and the accumulation of H2O2 in both CHA0-and BABA-treated plants pointed to an important contribution to resistance.",

We find that upon encountering the ribosome, the stem-loops strongly inhibit A-site tRNA binding and ribosome intersubunit rotation that accompanies translation elongation. Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) reveals that the HIV stem-loop docks into the A site of the ribosome.

    "abstract": "PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) target transcripts by sequence complementarity serving as guides for RNA slicing in animal germ cells. The piRNA pathway is increasingly recognized as critical for essential cellular functions such as germline development and reproduction. In the Anopheles gambiae ovary, as much as 11% of piRNAs map to protein-coding genes. Here we show that ovarian mRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are processed into piRNAs that can direct other transcripts into the piRNA biogenesis pathway. Targeting piRNAs fuel transcripts either into the ping-pong cycle of piRNA amplification or into the machinery of phased piRNA biogenesis, thereby creating networks of inter-regulating transcripts. RNAs of the same network share related genomic repeats. These repeats give rise to piRNAs, which target other transcripts and lead to a cascade of concerted RNA slicing. While ping-pong networks are based on repeats of several hundred nucleotides, networks that rely on phased piRNA biogenesis operate through short [~]40-nucleotides long repeats, which we named snetDNAs. Interestingly, snetDNAs are recurring in evolution from insects to mammals. Our study brings to light a new type of a conserved regulatory pathway, the snetDNA-pathway, by which short sequences can include independent genes and lncRNAs in the same biological pathway.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYSmall RNA molecules are essential actors in silencing mobile genetic elements in animal germ cells. The 24-29-nucleotide-long Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) target transcripts by sequence complementarity serving as guides for RNA slicing. Mosquitoes of the Anopheles gambiae species complex are the principal vectors of malaria, and research on their germline is essential to develop new strategies of vector control by acting on reproduction. In the Anopheles gambiae ovary as much as 11% of piRNAs originate from protein-coding genes. We identified piRNAs which are able to target transcripts from several distinct genes or long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), bringing together genic transcripts and lncRNAs in a same regulation network. piRNA targeting induces transcript slicing and production of novel piRNAs, which then target other mRNAs and lncRNAs leading again to piRNA processing, thus resulting in a cascade of RNA slicing and piRNA production. Each network relies on piRNAs originating from repeated genetic elements, present in all transcripts of the same network. Some of these repeats are very short, only [~]40-nucleotides long. We identified similar repeats in all 43 animal species that we analysed, including mosquitoes, flies, arachnidae, snail, mouse, rat and human, suggesting that such regulation networks are recurrent, possibly conserved, in evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "The question of how natural evolution acts on DNA and protein sequences to ensure mutational robustness and evolvability has been asked for decades without definitive answer. We tackled this issue through a structurome-scale computational investigation, in which we estimated the change in folding free energy upon all possible single-site mutations introduced in more than 20,000 protein structures. The validity of our results are supported by a very good agreement with experimental mutagenesis data. At the amino acid level, we found the protein surface to be more robust to mutations than the core, in a protein length-dependent manner. About 4% of all mutations were shown to be stabilizing, and a majority of mutations on the surface and in the core to be neutral and destabilizing, respectively. At the nucleobase level, single base substitutions were shown to yield on average less destabilizing amino acid mutations than multiple base substitutions. More precisely, the smallest average destabilization occurs for substitutions of base III in the codon, followed by base I, bases I+III, and base II. This ranking highly anticorrelates with the frequency of codon-anticodon mispairing, and suggests that the standard genetic code is optimized more to limit translation errors than the impact of random mutations. Moreover, the codon usage also appears to be optimized for minimizing the errors at the protein level, especially for surface residues that evolve faster and have therefore been under stronger selection, and for biased codons, suggesting that the codon usage bias also partly aims to optimize protein mutational robustness.",

    "abstract": "The re-emergence of a neural crest transcriptional program, including Sox10 upregulation, is a key step in melanoma initiation in humans and zebrafish. We hypothesize that epigenetic regulation of sox10 modulates melanoma initiation. ATAC-Seq analysis of zebrafish melanoma tumors identifies recurrently open chromatin domains near sox10. Reporter constructs for each putative sox10 enhancer were examined in zebrafish embryos for neural crest activity and in stable transgenic lines for melanoma activity. One element, peak5 (23 kilobases upstream of sox10), drives EGFP reporter expression in a subset of neural crest cells, Kolmer-Agduhr neurons, and early melanoma patches and tumors with high specificity. A [~]200 bp region, conserved across the Cyprinidae family (fish), is required for peak5 activity in neural crest and melanoma, and contains dimeric SoxE binding sites essential for neural crest activity. Our work identifies a novel melanoma transcriptional enhancer, expanding our knowledge of epigenetic regulation of neural crest identity in melanoma.",

    "abstract": "Protection of peri-centromeric REC8 cohesin from separase and sister kinetochore attachment to microtubules emanating from the same spindle pole (co-orientation) ensure that sister chromatids remain associated after meiosis I. Both features are lost during meiosis II, when sister kinetochores bi-orient and lose peri-centromeric REC8 protection, resulting in sister chromatid disjunction and the production of haploid gametes. By transferring spindle-chromosome complexes (SCCs) between meiosis I and II cells, we have discovered that both sister kinetochore co-orientation and peri-centromeric cohesin protection depend on the SCC and not the cytoplasm. Moreover, the catalytic activity of separase at meiosis I is necessary not only for converting kinetochores from a co-to a bi-oriented state but also for deprotection of peri-centromeric cohesin and that cleavage of REC8 may be the key event. Crucially, we show that selective cleavage of REC8 in the vicinity of kinetochores is sufficient to destroy co-orientation in univalent chromosomes, albeit not in bivalents where resolution of chiasmata through cleavage of Rec8 along chromosome arms may also be required.",

    "abstract": "Profilin2 (PFN2) is a target of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) enriched miR-290 family of miRNAs and an actin/dynamin binding protein implicated in endocytosis. Here, we show that the miR-290-PFN2 pathway regulates many aspects of ESC biology. In the absence of microRNAs, PFN2 is upregulated in ESCs, with a resulting decrease in endocytosis. Reintroduction of miR-290, knockout of PFN2, or disruption of the PFN2 dynamin interacting domain in miRNA deficient cells reverses the endocytosis defect. The loss of miRNA suppression of PFN2 and associated reduction in endocytosis impairs ERK signaling, which in turn inhibits ESC cell cycle progression and differentiation from a naive to formative state. Mutagenesis of the single canonical conserved 3UTR miR-290 binding site of PFN2 in otherwise wild-type cells recapitulates these phenotypes. Together, these findings define an axis of post-transcriptional control, endocytosis, and signal transduction that is essential for ESC self-renewal and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The first metastable assembly intermediate of the eukaryotic ribosomal small subunit (SSU) is the SSU Processome, a large complex of RNA and protein factors that is thought to represent an early checkpoint in the assembly pathway. Transition of the SSU Processome towards continued maturation requires the removal of the U3 snoRNA and biogenesis factors as well as ribosomal RNA processing. While the factors that drive these events are largely known, how they do so is not well understood. The methyltransferase Bud23 has a role during this transition, but its function, beyond the nonessential methylation of 18S rRNA, is not characterized. Here, we have carried out a comprehensive genetic screen to understand Bud23 function. We identified 67 unique extragenic bud23{Delta}-suppressing mutations that mapped to genes encoding the SSU Processome factors DHR1, IMP4, UTP2 (NOP14), BMS1 and the SSU protein RPS28A. These factors form a physical interaction network that links the binding site of Bud23 to the U3 snoRNA and many of the suppressing mutations weaken protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. Importantly, this network links Bud23 to the GTPase Bms1 and the RNA helicase Dhr1. Bms1 is thought to drive conformational changes to promote rRNA cleavage, and we previously showed that Dhr1 is required for unwinding the U3 snoRNA. Moreover, particles isolated from cells lacking Bud23 accumulated late SSU Processome factors and pre-rRNAs not cleaved at sites A1 and A2. We propose a model in which Bud23 dissociates factors surrounding its binding site to promote SSU Processome progression.\n\nAuthor summaryRibosomes are the molecular machines that synthesize proteins and are composed of a large and a small subunit which carry out the essential functions of polypeptide synthesis and mRNA decoding, respectively. Ribosome production is tightly linked to cellular growth as cells must produce enough ribosomes to meet their protein needs. However, ribosome assembly is a metabolically expensive pathway that must be balanced with other cellular energy needs and regulated accordingly. In eukaryotes, the small subunit (SSU) Processome is a metastable intermediate that ultimately progresses towards a mature SSU through the release of biogenesis factors. The decision to progress the SSU Processome is thought to be an early checkpoint in the SSU assembly pathway, but what drives this checkpoint is unknown. Previous studies suggest that Bud23 plays an uncharacterized role during SSU Processome progression. Here, we used a genetic approach to understand its function and found that Bud23 is connected to a network of factors that stabilize the particle. Interestingly, two of these factors are enzymes that facilitate structural rearrangements needed for progression. We conclude that Bud23 promotes the release of factors surrounding its binding site to drive rearrangements during the progression of the SSU Processome.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing problem is how cells that lack one of the highly similar ribosomal proteins (RPs) often display distinct phenotypes. Some may reflect general effects due to lower growth rate and ribosome levels, but a number of diverse phenotypes cannot be explained through this mechanism. Yeast and other organisms live longer when they lack specific ribosomal proteins, especially of the large 60S subunit of the ribosome. However, longevity is neither associated with the generation time of RP deletion mutants nor with bulk inhibition of protein synthesis. Here, we comprehensively queried actively dividing RP paralog mutants through the cell cycle. Our data link transcriptional, translational, and metabolic changes to phenotypes associated with the loss of paralogous RPs. We uncovered specific translational control of transcripts encoding enzymes of methionine and serine metabolism, which are part of one-carbon (1C) pathways. Cells lacking Rpl22Ap, which are long-lived, have lower levels of metabolites associated with 1C metabolism. Loss of 1C enzymes, such as the serine hydroxymethyltransferase Shm2p increased the longevity of wild type cells. These results provide a molecular basis for paralog-specific phenotypes in ribosomal mutants and underscore the significance of 1C metabolic pathways in mechanisms of cell division and cellular aging. 1C pathways exist in all organisms, including humans, and targeting the relevant enzymes could represent longevity interventions.",

    "abstract": "The conserved Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has a well-established role in animal development, however its function during adulthood remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated whether the Hh signaling pathway is active during adult life in Drosophila melanogaster and uncovered a protective function for Hh signaling in coordinating correct proteostasis in glial cells. Adult-specific depletion of Hh reduces lifespan, locomotor activity and dopaminergic neuron integrity. Conversely, increased expression of Hh extends lifespan and improves fitness. Moreover, Hh pathway activation in glia rescues the lifespan and age-associated defects of hedgehog (hh) mutants. At the molecular level, the Hh pathway regulates downstream chaperones, principally hsp40 and hsp68, whose overexpression in glial cells rescues the shortened lifespan and proteostasis defects of hh mutants. Finally, we demonstrate the protective ability of Hh signalling in a Drosophila Alzheimers disease model expressing human Amyloid Beta (A{beta}1-42) in the glia. Overall, we propose that Hh signalling is requisite for lifespan determination and correct proteostasis in glial cells and may have potential in ameliorating a wide range of degenerative diseases.",

The tapejarids represent the most representative group of pterosaurs from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of the Araripe Basin (Northeastern Brazil). The holotype of the large tapejarid Tupandactylus imperator Campos and Kellner, 1997 is known by two main slabs from the New Olinda Member of the Crato Formation, however, only one of the slabs containing the sagittally bipartite skull is referred to the holotype of Tupandactylus imperator, remain the counter-slab be properly described. The cotype is fragmented in several broken pieces and presents a significative number of cranial elements. A medial internasal septum completely preserved inside the nasoantorbital fenestra is reported for the first time for pterosaurs. The exceptional preservation of a collagenous septum and other integumentary structures visible in the cotype specimen is extremely rare and supports the concept of the unusual pattern of soft tissue observed in the fossils from the Crato Konservat-Lagerst\u00e4tte, specially pterosaurs. Herein is presented the description of the cotype of Tupandactylus imperator, in complementation to the previously designated slab of the holotype of this tapejarid species. The occurrence of casques in pterosaurs is supported by comparative anatomy with the bird galliform Pauxi (Cracidae). Besides that, it is discussed on the skull with extravagant cranial crests of Tupandactylus imperator and the significance of the associated soft tissues and other cranial integuments, which indicates an expressive morphological and taxonomic diversity among the tapejarid pterosaurs.View Full Text",

Here, we applied the two chemical inducers {beta}-aminobutyric acid (BABA) and benzo-(1,2,3)-thiadiazole-7-carbothioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) and the two biotic inducers Pseudomonas protegens CHA0 (CHA0) and P. chlororaphis PCL1391 (PCL) on the roots of wheat seedlings in order to test their ability to induce resistance against STB. At 21 days after inoculation, only plants treated with BABA showed a smaller area covered by lesions and less pycnidia compared to the untreated control plants. We evaluated spore germination and fungal development on inoculated wheat leaves at early infection stages using calcofluor white staining. Overall, spores of Z. tritici germinated less on plants soil-drenched with BABA and BTH and their hyphal growth was significantly delayed. On the contrary, CHA0 and PCL seed treatments did not affect fungal growth in wheat leaves. In conclusion, BABA efficiently enhanced plant resistance to Z. tritici, BTH delayed fungal development at early stages while the two biotic inducers did not enhance resistance against STB disease.",

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction AMOS-PCR and quantitative Real-Time PCR (qPCR) targeting the genus specific surface protein bcsp31 gene and the insertion sequence IS711 element downstream of the alkB gene for B. abortus and BMEI1162 gene for B. melitensis were employed on the samples.\n\nResultsResults indicated that out of 189 samples examined, 12 (6.4%) and 22 (11.6%) contained Brucella DNA as detected by AMOS-PCR and qPCR, respectively. Most of the positive samples were from lions (52.6%) and buffaloes (19.6%). Other animals that were positive included wildebeest, impala, zebra and hyena. Out of 22 positive samples, 16 (66.7%) were identified as B. abortus and the rest were B. melitensis.\n\nConclusionDetection of zoonotic Brucella species in wildlife suggests that livestock and humans at the interface areas where there is high interaction are at risk of acquiring the infection.

    "abstract": "We report the earliest and the most abundant archaeobotanical assemblage of southwest Asian grain crops from Early Bronze Age Central Asia, recovered from the Chap II site in Kyrgyzstan. The archaeobotanical remains consist of thousands of cultivated grains dating to the mid-late 3rd millennium BCE. The recovery of cereal chaff, which is rare in archaeobotanical samples from Central Asia, allows for the identification of some crops to species and indicates local cultivation at 2000 m.a.s.l., as crop first spread to the mountains of Central Asia. The sites inhabitants cultivated two types of free-threshing wheats, glume wheats, and hulled and naked barleys. Highly compact morphotypes of wheat and barley grains represent a special variety of cereals adopted to highland environments. Moreover, glume wheats recovered at Chap II represent their most eastern distribution in Central Asia so far identified. Based on the presence of weed species, we argue that the past environment of Chap II was characterized by an open mountain landscape, where animal grazing likely took place, which may have been further modified by people irrigating agricultural fields. This research suggests that early farmers in the mountains of Central Asia cultivated a high diversity of southwest Asian crops during the initial eastward dispersal of agricultural technologies, which likely played a critical role in shaping montane adaptations and dynamic interaction networks between farming societies across highland and lowland cultivation zones.",

We measured a series of physiological and biochemical indexes for drought-treated plants, and analyzed the expression of drought-responsive genes in Asplenium nidus by RT-qPCR. The results show that the Asplenium nidus is a species with drought tolerance. Asplenium nidus inhibits plant photosynthesis and reduces life activities by limiting stomatal opening to adapt to drought. To resist drought stress, the Asplenium nidus changes the osmotic potential by increasing the proline content to maintain normal metabolic activities and prevents the damage of active oxygen by increasing the enzyme activities of SOD and POD. Based on the analysis of the relative expression levels of genes, AVP1-2 and AVP1-4 may be drought-resistant genes in Asplenium nidus.

We apply a novel method that uses a theoretical relation between the time-lagged cross-covariance and the equal-time cross-covariance to reveal directed effective connectivity and synaptic weights of cortical neuron cultures at different days in vitro from multielectrode array recordings. Using a stochastic leaky-integrate-and-fire model, we show that the simulated spiking activity of the reconstructed networks can well capture the measured network bursts. The neuronal networks are found to be highly nonrandom with an over-representation of bidirectionally connections as compared to a random network of the same connection probability, with the fraction of inhibitory nodes comparable to the measured fractions of inhibitory neurons in various cortical regions in monkey, and have small-world topology with basic network measures comparable to those of the nematode C. elegans chemical synaptic network. Our analyses further reveal that (i) the excitatory and inhibitory incoming degrees have bimodal distributions the excitatory and inhibitory incoming degrees have bimodal distributions, which are that distributions that have been indicated to be optimal against both random failures and attacks in undirected networks; (ii) the distribution of the physical length of excitatory incoming links has two peaks indicating that excitatory signal is transmitted at two spatial scales, one localized to nearest nodes and the other spatially extended to nodes millimeters away, and the shortest links are mostly excitatory towards excitatory nodes and have larger synaptic weights on average; (iii) the average incoming and outgoing synaptic strength is non-Gaussian with long tails and, in particular, the distribution of outgoing synaptic strength of excitatory nodes with excitatory incoming synaptic strength is lognormal, similar to the measured excitatory postsynaptic potential in rat cortex.\n\nAuthor summaryTo understand how the brain processes signal and carries out its function, it is useful to know the connectivity of the underlying neuronal circuits. For large-scale neuronal networks, it is difficult to measure connectivity directly using electron microscopy techniques and methods that can estimate connectivity from electrophysiological recordings are thus highly desirable. Existing methods focus mainly on estimating functional connectivity, which is defined by statistical dependencies between neuronal activities but the relevant direct casual interactions are captured by effective connectivity. Here we apply a novel covariance-relation based method to estimate the directed effective connectivity and synaptic weights of cortical neuron cultures from recordings of multielectrode array of over 4000 electrodes taken at different days in vitro. The neuronal networks are found to be nonrandom, small-world, excitation/inhibition balanced as measured in monkey cortex, and with feeder hubs. Our analyses further suggest some form of specialisation of nodes in receiving excitatory and inhibitory signals and the transmission of excitatory signals at two spatial scales, one localized to nearest nodes and the other spatially extended to nodes millimeters away, and reveal that the distributions of the average incoming and outgoing synaptic strength are skewed with long tails.",

    "abstract": "For most antivenoms there is little information from clinical studies to infer the relationship between dose and efficacy or dose and toxicity. Antivenom dose-finding studies usually recruit too few patients (e.g. less than 20) relative to clinically significant event rates (e.g. 5%). Model based adaptive dose-finding studies make efficient use of accrued patient data by using information across dosing levels, and converge rapidly to the contextually defined  optimal dose. Adequate sample sizes for adaptive dose-finding trials can be determined by simulation studies.\n\nWe propose a model based, Bayesian phase 2 type, adaptive clinical trial design for the characterisation of optimal initial antivenom doses in contexts where both efficacy and toxicity are measured as binary endpoints. This design is illustrated in the context of dose-finding for Daboia siamensis (Eastern Russells viper) envenoming in Myanmar. The design formalises the optimal initial dose of antivenom as the dose closest to that giving a pre-specified desired efficacy, but resulting in less than a pre-specified maximum toxicity. For Russells viper efficacy is defined as the restoration of blood coagulability within six hours, and toxicity is defined as anaphylaxis. Comprehensive simulation studies compared the expected behaviour of the model based design to a simpler rule based design (a modified  3+3 design). The model based design can identify the optimal dose after fewer patients than the rule based design. Open source code for the simulations can be used to calculate sample sizes under a priori beliefs of efficacy and toxicity.\n\nAntivenom dose-finding trials would benefit from using standard model based adaptive designs. Dose-finding trials where rare events (e.g. 5% occurrence) are of clinical importance necessitate larger sample sizes than current practice. We will apply the model based design to determine a safe and efficacious dose for a novel lyophilised antivenom to treat Daboia siamensis envenoming in Myanmar.\n\nAuthor summarySnakebite envenoming is one of the most neglected tropical diseases relative to its mortality and morbidity. Antivenoms are the only known effective treatment for snake-bite envenoming but are frequently responsible for high rates of adverse reactions. Clinical development of antivenoms rarely follows the iterative phases of clinical development applied to other drugs. Dosing is typically based on pre-clinical testing.\n\nHere we propose a Bayesian model based adaptive design for clinical trials aiming to determine the optimal dose of antivenom needed. Optimality is defined using safety and efficacy thresholds contextual to the study. This design can be applied to all antivenoms which have binary efficacy and toxicity endpoints. Our design formally specifies a desired efficacy and a maximum tolerated toxicity. We use simulation studies to characterise the sample size necessary to determine the optimal dose in different scenarios. The simulation studies highlight the advantages of a model based design over simpler rule based alternatives. We intend to use this design to determine an effective and safe dose of the new lyophilised viper antivenom currently in use to treat Russells viper envenoming in Myanmar.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and it is one of the main causes of death for women worldwide. To attain an optimum medical treatment for breast cancer, an early breast cancer detection is crucial. This paper proposes a multistage feature selection method that extracts statistically significant features for breast cancer size detection using proposed data normalization techniques. Ultra-wideband (UWB) signals, controlled using microcontroller are transmitted via an antenna from one end of the breast phantom and are received on the other end. These ultra-wideband analogue signals are represented in both time and frequency domain. The preprocessed digital data is passed to the proposed multi-stage feature selection algorithm. This algorithm has four selection stages. It comprises of data normalization methods, feature extraction, data dimensional reduction and feature fusion. The output data is fused together to form the proposed datasets, namely, 8-HybridFeature, 9-HybridFeature and 10-HybridFeature datasets. The classification performance of these datasets is tested using the Support Vector Machine, Probabilistic Neural Network and Naive Bayes classifiers for breast cancer size classification. The research findings indicate that the 8-HybridFeature dataset performs better in comparison to the other two datasets. For the 8-HybridFeature dataset, the Naive Bayes classifier (91.98%) outperformed the Support Vector Machine (90.44%) and Probabilistic Neural Network (80.05%) classifiers in terms of classification accuracy. The finalized method is tested and visualized in the MATLAB based 2D and 3D environment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAcute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a growing global health problem, and precision medicine techniques hold promise for the development of diagnostic indicators of ACS. In this pilot, we sought to assess the utility of an integrated analysis of metabolomic and microRNA data in peripheral blood to distinguish patients with abnormal cardiac stress testing from matched controls.\n\nMethodsWe used prospectively collected samples from emergency department (ED) patients placed in an ED-based observation unit who underwent stress testing for ACS. We isolated microRNA and quantified metabolites from plasma collected before and after stress testing in patients with myocardial ischemia on stress testing versus those with normal stress tests. The combined metabolomic and microRNA data were analyzed jointly for case (ischemia) and 1:1 matched control patients in a supervised, dimension-reducing discriminant analysis. Two integrative models were implemented: a baseline model utilizing data collected prior to stress-testing (T0) and a stress-delta model, which included the difference between post-stress test (T1) and pre-stress test (T0).\n\nResultsSeven case patients with myocardial ischemia on ED cardiac stress testing (6 females, 85% Caucasian, mean Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction Score=3, 4 patients ultimately received percutaneous coronary intervention) were 1:1 age and sex-matched to controls. Several metabolites and microRNAs were differentially expressed between cases and controls. Integrative analysis of the baseline levels of metabolites and microRNA expression showed modest performance for distinguishing cases from controls with an overall error rate of 0.143. The stress-delta model showed worse performance for distinguishing cases from controls, with an overall error rate of 0.500.\n\nConclusionsGiven our small sample size, results are hypothesis-generating. However, this pilot study shows a potential method for a precision medicine approach to cardiac stress testing in patients undergoing workup for ACS.",
