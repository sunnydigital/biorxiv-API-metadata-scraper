    "abstract": "Prospection (mentally simulating future events) generates emotionally charged mental images that guide social decision-making. Positive and negative social expectancies - imagining new social interactions to be rewarding vs. threatening - are core components of social approach and avoidance motivation, respectively. Stable individual differences in such positive and negative future-related cognitions may be underpinned by distinct neuroanatomical substrates. Here, we asked 100 healthy adults to vividly imagine themselves in a novel self-relevant social scenario that was ambiguous with regards to possible social acceptance or rejection. During this task we measured their expectancies for social reward (e.g. anticipated feelings of social connection) or threat (e.g. anticipated feelings of rejection). On a separate day they underwent structural MRI; voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was used to explore the relation between their social reward and threat expectancies and regional grey matter volumes (rGMV). Increased rGMV in key regions involved in prospection, subjective valuation and emotion regulation (including ventromedial prefrontal cortex), correlated with both higher social reward and lower social threat expectancies. In contrast, social threat expectancies were uniquely linked with rGMV of regions involved in social attention (posterior superior temporal sulcus) and interoception (somatosensory cortex). These findings provide novel insight into the neurobiology of future-oriented cognitive-affective processes critical to adaptive social functioning.",

The problem is reduced to that of determining the eigenvalues of a suitable class of sparse random matrices, randomness being a consequence of the network structure.

    "abstract": "LPA1 is one of the six known receptors (LPA1-6) for lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Constitutive Lpar1 null mutant mice have been instrumental in identifying roles for LPA-LPA1 signaling in neurobiological processes, brain development, and behavior as well as modelling human neurological diseases like neuropathic pain. Constitutive Lpar1 null mutant mice are protected from partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSNL)-induced neuropathic pain, however Lpar1 expressing cell types that are functionally responsible for mediating this protective effect are unknown. Here we report generation of a Lpar1flox/flox conditional null mutant mouse that allows cre-mediated conditional deletion combined with its use in a PSNL pain model. Lpar1flox/flox mice were crossed with cre transgenic lines driven by neural gene promoters for nestin (all neural cells), synapsin (neurons), or P0 (Schwann cells). CD11b-cre transgenic mice were also used to delete Lpar1 in microglia. PSNL-initiated pain responses were reduced following cre-mediated Lpar1 deletion with all 3 neural promoters but not the microglial promoter, supporting involvement of Schwann cells and central and/or peripheral neurons in mediating pain. Interestingly, rescue responses that were due to conditional deletion were non-identical, implicating distinct roles for Lpar1-expressing cell types. Our results with a new Lpar1 conditional mouse mutant expand an understanding of LPA1 signaling in the PSNL model of neuropathic pain.",

    "abstract": "Hop (Humulus lupulus L.) is known for its use as a bittering agent in beer and has a rich history of cultivation, beginning in Europe and now spanning the globe. There are five wild varieties worldwide, which may have been introgressed with cultivated varieties. As a dioecious species, its obligate outcrossing, non-Mendelian inheritance, and genomic structural variability have confounded directed breeding efforts. Consequently, understanding genome evolution in Humulus represents a considerable challenge, requiring additional resources, including integrated genome maps. In order to facilitate cytogenetic investigations into the transmission genetics of hop, we report here the identification and characterization of 17 new and distinct tandem repeat sequence families. A tandem repeat discovery pipeline was developed using k-mer filtering and dot plot analysis of PacBio long-read sequences from the hop cultivar Apollo. We produced oligonucleotide FISH probes from conserved regions of HuluTR120 and HulTR225 and demonstrated their utility to stain meiotic chromosomes from wild hop, var. neomexicanus. The HuluTR225 FISH probe hybridized to several loci per nucleus and exhibited irregular, non-Mendelian transmission in male meiocytes of wild hop. Collectively, these tandem repeat sequence families not only represent unique and valuable new cytogenetic reagents but also have the capacity to inform genome assembly efforts and support comparative genomic analyses.",

    "abstract": "MotivationA common strategy to infer and quantify interactions between components of a biological system is to deduce them from the networks response to targeted perturbations. Such perturbation experiments are often challenging and costly. Therefore, optimising the experimental design is essential to achieve a meaningful characterisation of biological networks. However, it remains difficult to predict which combination of perturbations allows to infer specific interaction strengths in a given network topology. Yet, such a description of identifiability is necessary to select perturbations that maximize the number of inferable parameters.\n\nResultsWe show analytically that the identifiability of network parameters can be determined by an intuitive maximum flow problem. Furthermore, we used the theory of matroids to describe identifiability relationships between sets of parameters in order to build identifiable effective network models. Collectively, these results allowed to device strategies for an optimal design of the perturbation experiments. We benchmarked these strategies on a database of human pathways. Remarkably, full network identifiability was achieved with on average less than a third of the perturbations that are needed in a random experimental design. Moreover, we determined perturbation combinations that additionally decreased experimental effort compared to single-target perturbations. In summary, we provide a framework that allows to infer a maximal number of interaction strengths with a minimal number of perturbation experiments.\n\nAvailabilityIdentiFlow is available at github.com/GrossTor/IdentiFlow.\n\nContactnils.bluethgen@charite.de",

    "abstract": "Multimodal data fusion is a topic of great interest. Several fusion methods have been proposed to investigate coherent patterns and corresponding linkages across modalities, such as joint independent component analysis (jICA), multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA), mCCA+jICA, disjoint subspace using ICA (DS-ICA) and parallel ICA. JICA exploits source independence but assumes shared loading parameters. MCCA maximizes correlation linkage across modalities directly but is limited to orthogonal features. While there is no theoretical limit to the number of modalities analyzed together by jICA, mCCA, or the two-step approach mCCA+jICA, these approaches can only extract common features and require the same number of sources/components for all modalities. On the other hand, DS-ICA and parallel ICA can identify both common and distinct features but are limited to two modalities. DS-ICA assumes shared loading parameters among common features, which works well when links are strong. Parallel ICA simultaneously maximizes correlation between modalities and independence of sources, while allowing different number of sources for each modality. However, only a very limited number of modalities and linkage pairs can be optimized. To overcome these limitations, we propose aNy-way ICA, a new model to simultaneously maximize the independence of sources and correlations across modalities. aNy-way ICA combines infomax ICA and Gaussian independent vector analysis (IVA-G) via a shared weight matrix model without orthogonality constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that aNy-way ICA not only accurately recovers sources and loadings, but also the true covariance/linkage patterns, whether different modalities have the same or different number of sources. Moreover, aNy-way ICA outperforms mCCA and mCCA+jICA in terms of source and loading recovery accuracy, especially under noisy conditions.\n\nClinical RelevanceThis establishes a model for N-way data fusion of any number of modalities and linkage pairs, allowing different number of non-orthogonal sources for different modalities.",

Indeed, contemporary technologies such as single-molecule and digital measurements have challenged, or even rendered obsolete, core aspects of the conventional wisdom related to binding assay design. Here, we explore the fundamental principles underlying molecular recognition systems, which we consider in terms of signals generated through concentration-dependent shifts in equilibrium. We challenge certain orthodoxies related to binding-based detection assays, including the primary importance of a low KD and the extent to which this parameter constrains dynamic range and limit of detection.

    "abstract": "Concepts from dynamical systems theory, including multi-stability, oscillations, robustness and stochasticity, are increasingly implicated in the control of gene expression during cell fate decisions, inflammation and stem cell heterogeneity. However, the prevalence of the underlying structures within gene networks which drive these dynamical behaviours, such as direct autoregulation or feedback by microRNAs, is unknown.\n\nWe integrate transcription factor binding site (TFBS) and microRNA target data to generate a gene interaction network across 28 human tissues. This network was interrogated to identify network motifs capable of driving dynamical gene expression, in particular oscillations. Autoregulatory motifs were identified in 56% of transcription factors (TFs) investigated, 89% of which were also found in dual feedback motifs with a microRNA. Both the autoregulatory and dual feedback motifs were enriched in the network. TFs that autoregulate were found to be highly conserved between tissues. Dual feedback motifs with microRNAs were also conserved, but less so. Such dual feedback motifs were conserved between tissues, although TFs regulate different combinations of microRNAs in a tissue-dependent manner.\n\nTFs which autoregulate are prevalent among human TFs and have more interactions with microRNAs than non-autoregulatory genes. The enrichment of such motifs within the human transcriptional network indicates that more genes may have interesting expression dynamics than previously thought. These data provide a resource for the identification of TFs which regulate the dynamical properties of human gene expression. These findings support the development of dynamical conceptual frameworks for the study of fundamental biological processes.",

To investigate the underlying neural mechanisms of this process, we developed a model of stabilized neoHebbian correlative learning which is augmented by an eligibility signal and a temporal trace of activations. This 3-component learning algorithm facilitates stable, yet flexible, formation of spatially registered auditory space maps composed of conductance-based topographically organized neu- ral units. Spatially aligned maps are learned for visual and auditory input stimuli that arrive in temporal and spatial registration. The reliability of visual sensory inputs can be used to regulate the learning rate in the form of an eligibility trace. We show that by shifting visual sensory inputs at the onset of learning the topography of auditory space maps is shifted accordingly. Simulation results explain why a shift of auditory maps in mature animals is possible only if corrections are induced in small steps. We conclude that learning spatially aligned auditory maps is flexibly controlled by reliable visual sensory neurons and can be formalized by a biological plausible unsupervised learning mechanism.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, biosynthesis of many extracellular matrix glycans occurs in the Golgi apparatus. These proteins include glycosyltransferases, modifying enzymes and nucleotide-sugar conversion enzymes, many of which possess a type II membrane topology. Growing evidence indicates that both the function and Golgi localization of many of these proteins are regulated through protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Given the essential nature and conservation of extracellular matrix polysaccharides, it is likely that PPIs are more prevalent among biosynthetic enzymes. However the identification of PPIs among Golgi proteins has been technically challenging due to the generally low abundance and unique membrane topology of these proteins. The aim of this article is to explore the feasibility of cDNA library screening by a yeast-based modified split ubiquitin system as a mean for unbiased screening for PPIs involving a Golgi-localized type II membrane. As a test case, a galacturonosyltransferase1 (GAUT1), involved in pectin biosynthesis in the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana, was used as the bait. Construction and screening of Arabidopsis cDNA libraries using GAUT1 as the bait successfully led to identification of GAUT7, a previously reported interaction partner of GAUT1, which validates the method. Furthermore, 25 novel candidate interaction partners were identified. The results contribute to shape a field guide for identifying PPIs involving glycan biosynthetic enzymes in eukaryotic cells.",

    "abstract": "Controlling our own thoughts is central to mental wellbeing and its failure is at the crux of a number of mental disorders. Paradoxically, behavioural evidence shows that thought-suppression often fails. Despite the broad importance of understanding the mechanisms of thought control, little is known about the fate of neural representations of suppressed thoughts. Using functional MRI, we investigated the brain areas involved in controlling visual thoughts and tracked suppressed thought representations using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA). Participants were asked to either visualize a vegetable/fruit or suppress any visual thoughts about those objects. Surprisingly, the content (object identity) of successfully suppressed thoughts was still decodable in visual and executive areas with algorithms trained on perception or imagery. This suggests that pictorial representations of the suppressed thoughts are still present despite individuals reporting they are not. Thought generation was associated with the left hemisphere, whereas thought suppression with right hemisphere engagement. Further, GLM analyses showed that subjective success in thought suppression was correlated with engagement of executive areas, while thought-suppression failure was associated with engagement of visual and memory related areas. These results reveal that the content of suppressed thoughts exist hidden from awareness, seemingly without an individuals knowledge, providing a compelling reason why thought suppression is so ineffective. These data inform models of unconscious thought production and could be used to develop new treatment approaches to disorders involving maladaptive thoughts.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state brain activity is characterized by the presence of neuronal avalanches showing absence of characteristic size. Such evidence has been interpreted in the context of criticality and associated with the normal functioning of the brain. At criticality, a crucial role is played by long-range power-law correlations. Thus, to verify the hypothesis that the brain operates close to a critical point and consequently assess deviations from criticality for diagnostic purposes, it is of primary importance to robustly and reliably characterize correlations in resting-state brain activity. Recent works focused on the analysis of narrow band electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) signal amplitude envelope, showing evidence of long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) in neural oscillations. However, this approach is not suitable for assessing long-range correlations in broadband resting-state cortical signals. To overcome such limitation, here we propose to characterize the correlations in the broadband brain activity through the lens of neuronal avalanches. To this end, we consider resting-state EEG and long-term MEG recordings, extract the corresponding neuronal avalanche sequences, and study their temporal correlations. We demonstrate that the broadband resting-state brain activity consistently exhibits long-range power-law correlations in both EEG and MEG recordings, with similar values of the scaling exponents. Importantly, although we observe that avalanche size distribution depends on scale parameters, scaling exponents characterizing long-range correlations are quite robust. In particular, they are independent of the temporal binning (scale of analysis), indicating that our analysis captures intrinsic characteristics of the underlying dynamics. Because neuronal avalanches constitute a fundamental feature of neural systems with universal characteristics, the proposed approach may serve as a general, systems- and experiment-independent procedure to infer the existence of underlying long-range correlations in extended neural systems, and identify pathological behaviors in the complex spatio-temporal interplay of cortical rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Group living organisms rely on intra-group communication to adjust individual and collective behavioural decisions. Complex communication systems are predominantly multimodal and combine modulatory and information bearing signals. The honey bee waggle dance, one of the most elaborate forms of communication in invertebrates, stimulates nestmates to search for food and communicates symbolic information about the location of the food source. Previous studies on the dance behaviour in diverse honey bee species demonstrated distinct differences in the combination of visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile signals produced by the dancer. We now studied the behaviour of the receivers of the dance signals, the dance followers, to explore the significance of the different signals in the communication process. In particular, we ask whether there are differences in the behaviour of dance followers between the 3 major Asian honey bee species, A. florea, A. dorsata and A. cerana, and whether these might correlate with the differences in the signals produced by the dancing foragers. Our comparison demonstrates that the behaviour of the dance followers is highly conserved across all 3 species despite the differences in the dance signals. The highest number of followers was present lateral to the dancer throughout the waggle run, and the mean body orientation of the dance followers with respect to the waggle dancer was close to 90{degrees} throughout the run for all 3 species. These findings suggest that dance communication might be more conserved than implied by the differences in the signals produced by the dancer. Along with studies in A. mellifera, our results indicate that all honey bee species rely on tactile contacts between the dancer and follower to communicate spatial information. The cues and signals that differ between the species may be involved in attracting the followers towards the dancer in the different nest environments.",

    "abstract": "Yield from fisheries is a tangible benefit of ecosystem services and sustaining or restoring a fish stock level to achieve a maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Snow crab (Chionoecetes opilio) off Tohoku has been managed by a total allowable catch since 1996, although their abundance has not increased even after 2011, when fishing pressure rapidly decreased because of the Great East Japan Earthquake. This implies that their biological characteristics, such as recruits, natural mortality coefficient (M), and terminal molting probabilities (p), might have changed. We developed \"just another state-space stock assessment model (JASAM)\" to estimate the MSY of the snow crab off Tohoku, Japan, considering interannual variations in M and p. The multi-model inference revealed that M increased from 0.2 in 1997 to 0.59 in 2018, although it was not different among the instars, sex, nor terminal molt of crabs. The parameter p also increased by 1.34-2.46 times depending on the instar growth stages from 1997 to 2018. We estimated the MSYs in three scenarios, which drastically changed if M and p were set as they were in the past or at the current values estimated from this study. This result indicated that the MSY of snow crab would also be time-varying based on their time-varying biological characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Connectivity among habitat patches in both natural and disturbed landscapes needs to be accounted for in conservation planning for biodiversity maintenance. Yet methods to assess connectivity are often limited, because simulating the dispersal of many species is computationally prohibitive, and current simulations make simplifying assumptions about movement that are potentially erroneous. Here we show how these limits can be circumvented and propose a novel framework for the assessment of omnifunctional and omnidirectional connectivity in a 28000 km2 area in the Laurentian region of Quebec, Canada. Our approach relies on (i) the use of Omniscape, an improved version of Circuitscape which allows omnidirectional simulations that better emulate animal movement and (ii) the synthesis of large volume of species-level dispersal simulations through a posteriori clustering of the current intensity. Our analysis reveals that the movement of 93 species evaluated can be clustered into three functional dispersal guilds, corresponding to mostly aquatic species, terrestrial species able to use aquatic environments, and strictly terrestrial species. These functional guilds do not share connectivity hotspots, suggesting that corridor planning would need to account for the multiplicity of dispersal strategies. Although this approach requires a large volume of computing resources, it provides richer information on which landscape features are critical to maintain or need to be regenerated for broader biodiversity maintenance goals.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal densities vary enormously across sites within a brain. Does the density of the capillary bed accompany the presumably larger energy requirement of sites with more neurons, or with larger neurons, or is energy supply constrained by a mostly homogeneous capillary bed? Here we find evidence for the latter across various sites in the mouse brain and show that as a result, the ratio of capillary cells per neuron, and thus presumably blood and energy supply per neuron, decreases uniformly with increasing neuronal density and therefore smaller average neuronal size across sites. Additionally, we find that local capillary density is also not correlated with local synapse densities, although there is a small but significant correlation between lower neuronal density (and therefore larger neuronal size) and more synapses per neuron within the restricted range of 6,500-9,500 across cortical sites. Further, local variations in the glial/neuron ratio are also not correlated with local variations in number of synapses per neuron or local synaptic densities. These findings suggest that it is not that larger neurons, neurons with more synapses, or even sites with more synapses demand more energy, but simply that larger (and thus fewer) neurons have more energy available per cell, and to its synapses as a whole, than smaller (and thus more numerous) neurons due to competition for limited resources supplied by a capillary bed of fairly homogeneous density throughout the brain.\n\nSignificance StatementThe brain is an expensive organ and at rest already uses nearly as much energy as during sensory activation. To ultimately determine whether the high energy cost of the brain is driven by an unusually high energy demand by neurons or constrained by capillary density in the organ, we examine whether sites in the mouse brain with more neurons, larger neurons, or more synapses have more capillary supply, and find instead that capillary density is mostly homogeneous across brain structures. We propose that neurons are constrained to using what energy is available, with little evidence for adjustments according to local demand, which explains its high risk of ischemia and vulnerability to states of compromised metabolism, including normal aging.",

    "abstract": "Linkage mapping has been widely used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) in many plants and usually requires a time-consuming and labor-intensive fine mapping process to find the causal gene underlying the QTL. Previously, we described QTG-Finder, a machine-learning algorithm to rationally prioritize candidate causal genes in QTLs. While it showed good performance, QTG-Finder could only be used in Arabidopsis and rice because of the limited number of known causal genes in other species. Here we tested the feasibility of enabling QTG-Finder to work on species that have few or no known causal genes by using orthologs of known causal genes as training set. The model trained with orthologs could recall about 64% of Arabidopsis and 83% of rice causal genes when the top 20% ranked genes were considered, which is similar to the performance of models trained with known causal genes. We further extended the algorithm to include polymorphisms in conserved non-coding sequences and gene presence/absence variation as additional features. Using this algorithm, QTG-Finder2, we trained and cross-validated Sorghum bicolor and Setaria viridis models. The S. bicolor model was validated by causal genes curated from the literature and could recall 70% of causal genes when the top 20% ranked genes were considered. In addition, we applied the S. viridis model and public transcriptome data to prioritize a plant height QTL and identified 13 candidate genes. QTL-Finder2 can accelerate the discovery of causal genes in any plant species and facilitate agricultural trait improvement.",

To date MYB family genes have not yet been comprehensively identified in the major staple fruit crop banana. In this study, we present a comprehensive, genome-wide analysis of the MYB genes from Musa acuminata DH-Pahang (A genome). A total of 285 R2R3-MYB genes as well as genes encoding three other classes of MYB proteins containing multiple MYB repeats were identified and characterised with respect to structure and chromosomal organisation. Organ- and development-specific expression patterns were determined from RNA-seq data. For 280 M. acuminata MYB genes for which expression was found in at least one of the analysed samples, a variety of expression patterns were detected. The M. acuminata R2R3-MYB genes were functionally categorised, leading to the identification of seven clades containing only M. acuminata R2R3-MYBs. The encoded proteins may have specialised functions that were acquired or expanded in Musa during genome evolution. This functional classification and expression analysis of the MYB gene family in banana establishes a solid foundation for future comprehensive functional analysis of MaMYBs and can be utilized in banana improvement programmes.",

Previously, we have shown that cannabinoid exposure via lactation during the early postnatal period disrupts early developmental trajectories of prefrontal cortex maturation and induces behavioral abnormalities during the first weeks of life in male and female rat progeny. Here, we investigated the lasting consequences of this postnatal cannabinoid exposure on synaptic and behavioral parameters in the adult offspring of {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-treated dams. At adulthood, these perinatally THC-exposed rats exhibits deficits in social discrimination accompanied by an overall augmentation of social exploratory behavior. These behavioral alterations were further correlated with multiple abnormalities in synaptic plasticity in the prefrontal cortex, including lost endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression (LTD), lost long-term potentiation and augmented mGlu2/3-LTD. Finally, basic parameters of intrinsic excitability at prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons were similarly altered by the perinatal THC exposure. Thus, perinatal THC exposure via lactation induces lasting deficits in behavior and synaptic function which persist into adulthood life in male and female progeny.",

    "abstract": "Feature-based attention can select relevant features such as colors or directions of motion from the visual field irrespective of the spatial position. In visual cortex not only do we see feature-specific attention affecting responses in neurons with receptive fields at an attended location, but that effect also spreads to neurons with receptive fields beyond the spatially relevant location. When only one feature is task relevant, the spread of activity across space can act to facilitate perception of behaviorally relevant stimuli. However, when multiple features are relevant, what is the effect on behavior and brain activity? We tested this question by having observers divide attention between two patches (left and right of fixation) of moving dot stimuli, each containing overlapping upward and downward motion fields. In one condition, subjects performed a task on motion fields moving in the same direction in both patches. In another condition attention was divided between opposite directions of motion. Replicating a previous behavioral study, we found that observers showed better performance when dividing attention to the same directions of motion than opposing directions of motion. We analyzed the BOLD responses while observers performed this task using an inverted encoding model approach that provides estimates of responses to each of the four component dot fields. We found larger responses to the attended components, replicating previous studies of spatial and feature-based attention. However, these effects were much larger when attention was divided to between the same directions of motion than to opposing directions. Our fMRI results in area hMT+ predict our behavioral results by extending the normalization model of attention to include a global feature-based attention component in that leads to suppressed responses to attended stimulus components when attention is directed to opposing directions of motion.",

    "abstract": "Patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) have difficulties controlling alcohol cravings and thus exhibit increased use and earlier relapse. Although patients tend to respond more strongly to alcohol-related images compared with non-alcohol-related images, few researchers examined the factors that modulate cravings. Here, we examined whole-brain blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to behavioural cues in individuals with AUD and healthy controls (HCs). The participants included 24 patients with severe AUD and 15 HCs. We presented four beverage images (juice, drinking juice, sake, and drinking sake) and compared participant BOLD responses between the two groups. Multiple comparisons revealed that the AUD group had lower BOLD responses compared with the HC group to images of drinking juice in the left precuneus (p = 0.036) and the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (p = 0.044) and higher BOLD responses to images of drinking sake in the left PCC (p = 0.044). Furthermore, compared to the HCs, the AUD patients had decreased BOLD responses associated with cue reactivity to drinking juice in the left precuneus during the period from 15 to 18 s (p = 0.004, df = 37) and 18 to 21 s (p = 0.002, df = 37). Using the Spearman correlation, we found a significant negative correlation between BOLD responses in the left PCC of the AUD patients and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores (r = -0.619, p = 0.001). Our findings suggest that HCs and severe AUD patients differ in their responses not to images of alcoholic beverages but those related to alcohol drinking behavior. Thus, these patients appear to have different patterns of brain activity. This information may aid clinicians in developing treatments for patients with AUD.",

We designed specific siRNA for down-regulation of OP18 in both cell lines. Phenotypes were characterized by cell viability, proliferation, and expression of apoptosis-related genes. Besides, sensitivity to cisplatin treatment was evaluated.\n\nResultsAnalysis of urine samples from patients with urothelial BCa revealed a significant correlation of the RNA-ratio oncoprotein 18:uroplakin 1A with bladder cancer. High urinary ratios were mainly found in moderately to poorly differentiated tumors (grade G2-3) that were muscle invasive (stage T2-3), whereas samples from patients with more differentiated non-invasive BCa (G1) showed low OP18:UPK1A RNA ratios. Down-regulation of OP18 expression in ECV-304 shifted its phenotype towards G1 state.
