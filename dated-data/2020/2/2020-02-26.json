    "abstract": "We introduce a new approach to modelling decision confidence, with the aim of enabling computationally cheap predictions while taking into account, and thereby exploiting, trial-by-trial variability in dynamic stimuli. Using the framework of the drift diffusion model of decision making, along with time-dependent thresholds and the idea of a Bayesian confidence readout, we derive expressions for the probability distribution over confidence reports. In line with current models of confidence, the derivations allow for the accumulation of \"pipeline\" evidence that has been received but not processed by the time of response, the effect of drift rate variability, and metacognitive noise. The expressions are valid for stimuli that change over the course of a trial with normally-distributed fluctuations in the evidence they provide. A number of approximations are made to arrive at the final expressions, and we test all approximations via simulation. The derived expressions contain only a small number of standard functions, and require evaluating only once per trial, making trial-by-trial modelling of confidence data in dynamic stimuli tasks more feasible. We conclude by using the expressions to gain insight into the confidence of optimal observers, and empirically observed patterns.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbial metabolism is associated with host longevity. However, because it requires direct manipulation of microbial metabolism in situ, establishing a causal link between these two processes remains challenging. We demonstrate an optogenetic method to control gene expression and metabolite production from bacteria residing in the host gut. We genetically engineer an Escherichia coli strain that synthesizes and secretes colanic acid (CA) under the quantitative control of light. Using this optogenetically-controlled strain to induce CA production directly in the Caenorhabditis elegans gut, we reveal the local effect of CA in protecting intestinal mitochondria from stress-induced hyper-fragmentation. We also exploit different intensities of light to determine that the lifespan-extending effect of CA is positively correlated with its levels produced from bacteria. Our results show that optogenetic control offers a rapid, reversible and quantitative way to fine-tune gut bacterial metabolism and uncover its local and systemic effects on host health and aging.",

    "abstract": "Homeostasis in adult tissues relies on the replication dynamics of stem cells, their progenitors and the spatial balance between them. This spatial and kinetic coordination is crucial to the successful maintenance of tissue size and its replenishment with new cells. However, our understanding of the role of cellular replicative lifespan and spatial correlation between cells in shaping tissue integrity is still lacking. We developed a mathematical model for the stochastic spatial dynamics that underlie the rejuvenation of corneal epithelium. Our model takes into account different spatial correlations between cell replication and cell removal. We derive the tradeoffs between replicative lifespan, spatial correlation length, and tissue rejuvenation dynamics. We determine the conditions that allow homeostasis and are consistent with biological timescales, pattern formation, and mutants phenotypes. Our results can be extended to any cellular system in which spatial homeostasis is maintained through cell replication.",

    "abstract": "Natural environments are seldom static and therefore it is important to ask how a population adapts in a changing environment. We consider a finite, diploid population with intermediate dominance evolving in a periodically changing environment and study how the fixation probability of a rare mutant depends on its dominance coefficient and the rate of environmental change. We find that in slowly changing environments, the dominance patterns are the same as in the static environment, that is, if a mutant is beneficial (deleterious) when it arrives, it is more (less) likely to fix if it is dominant. But in fast changing environments, these patterns depend on the mutants fitness on arrival as well as that in the time-averaged environment. We find that in a rapidly varying environment that is neutral or deleterious on-average, an initially beneficial (deleterious) mutant that arises while selection is decreasing (increasing) has a fixation probability lower (higher) than that for a neutral mutant leading to a reversal in the standard dominance patterns. We also find that recurrent mutations decrease the phase lag between the environment and the allele frequency, irrespective of the level of dominance.",

    "abstract": "Many broadly-dispersing marine taxa are species-rich, show genetic heterogeneity on small spatial scales, and are locally adapted to their environmental conditions. How such genetic subdivisions can emerge despite the potential for high gene flow continues to be the major paradox of evolution in the sea. One understudied process potentially contributing to genetic structuring in marine populations is variation in larval recruitment. Here, we report an unusual recruitment pattern in the broadcast-spawning coral species Acropora hyacinthus on Yap Island, Micronesia. Reduced representation genotyping of 275 individuals of varying size classes on this isolated reef system demonstrated general island-wide panmixia but also identified a genetically divergent group of juvenile corals at one out of the four sites sampled, showing elevated inbreeding and relatedness, including two pairs of siblings. Notably, adult corals as well as the majority of juveniles at the same site belong to the panmictic gene pool, suggesting that representatives of the inbred lineage of juveniles co-recruited and may be partially reproductively isolated from the rest of the island population. Reproductive isolation is suggested by the discovery of distinct genomic regions of greatly reduced genetic diversity in the inbred lineage, encompassing genes involved in sperm-egg recognition and fertilization that may serve as reproductive barrier loci. We propose that co-recruitment of genetic relatives via cohesive dispersal, a process that was previously unrecognized in broadcast-spawning corals, can generate familial genetic structure and might be important for the emergence of genetically distinct, locally adapted ecomorphs and cryptic species.",

    "abstract": "Recent research posits that the cognitive system samples target stimuli in a rhythmic fashion, characterized by target detection fluctuating at frequencies of ~3-8 Hz. Besides prioritized encoding of targets, a key cognitive function is the protection of working memory from distractor intrusion. Here, we test to which degree the vulnerability of working memory to distraction is rhythmic. In an Irrelevant-Speech Task, N = 23 human participants had to retain the serial order of nine numbers in working memory while being distracted by task-irrelevant speech with variable temporal onsets. The magnitude of the distractor-evoked N1 component in the event-related potential as well as behavioural recall accuracy, both measures of memory distraction, were periodically modulated by distractor onset time in approximately 2-4 cycles per second (Hz). Critically, an underlying 2.5-Hz rhythm explained variation in both measures of distraction such that stronger phasic distractor encoding mediated lower phasic memory recall accuracy. In a behavioural follow-up experiment, we tested whether these results would replicate in a task design without rhythmic presentation of target items. Participants (N = 6 with on average >2,500 trials, each) retained two line-figures in memory while being distracted by acoustic noise of varying onset across trials. In agreement with the main experiment, the temporal onset of the distractor periodically modulated memory performance. These results suggest that during working memory retention, the human cognitive system implements distractor suppression in a temporally dynamic fashion, reflected in ~400-ms long cycles of high versus low distractibility.",

    "abstract": "Transcription and translation are at the heart of metabolism and signal transduction. In this study, we developed an effective biophysical modeling approach to simulate transcription and translation processes. We tested this approach by simulating the dynamics of two cell free synthetic circuits. First, we considered a simple circuit in which sigma factor 70 induced the expression of green fluorescent protein. This relatively simple case was then followed by a more complex negative feedback circuit in which two control genes were coupled to the expression of a third reporter gene, green fluorescent protein. While many of the model parameters were estimated from previous biophysical literature, the remaining unknown model parameters for each circuit were estimated from messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein measurements using multi-objective optimization. In particular, either the literature parameter estimates were used directly in the model simulations, or characteristic literature values were used to establish feasible ranges for the multiobjective parameter search. Next, global sensitivity analysis was used to determine the influence of individual model parameters on the expression dynamics. Taken together, the effective biophysical modeling approach captured the expression dynamics, including the transcription dynamics, for the two synthetic cell free circuits. While we considered only two circuits here, this approach could potentially be extended to simulate other genetic circuits in both cell free and whole cell biomolecular applications.

Herein, we report production of active and soluble MTG in E. coli by using a chimeric protein of tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease and MTG zymogen. A chimera of TEV protease and MTG zymogen with native propeptide resulted in active MTG contaminated with cleaved propeptide due to the strong interaction between the propeptide and catalytic domain of MTG. Introduction of mutations of K9R and Y11A to the propeptide facilitated dissociation of the cleaved propeptide from the catalytic domain of MTG and active MTG without any contamination of the propeptide was obtained. The specific activity of the active MTG was 22.7{+/-}2.6 U/mg. The successful expression and purification of active MTG by using the chimera protein of TEV protease and MTG zymogen with mutations in the propeptide can advance the use of MTG and the researches using MTG mediated cross-linking reactions.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation can be favored through the green-beard mechanism, where a set of linked genes encodes both a cooperative trait and a phenotypic marker (green beard), which allows carriers of the trait to selectively direct cooperative acts to other carriers. In theory, the green-beard mechanism should favor cooperation even when interacting partners are totally unrelated at the genome level. Here, we explore such an extreme green-beard scenario between two unrelated bacterial species - Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia, which share a cooperative locus encoding the public good pyochelin (a siderophore) and its cognate receptor (green beard) required for iron-pyochelin uptake. We show that pyochelin, when provided in cell-free supernatants, can be mutually exchanged between species and provide fitness benefits under iron limitation. However, in co-culture we observed that these cooperative benefits vanished and communities were dominated by P. aeruginosa, regardless of strain background and species starting frequencies. Our results further suggest that P. aeruginosa engages in interference competition to suppress B. cenocepacia, indicating that inter-species conflict arising from dissimilarities at the genome level overrule the aligned cooperative interests at the pyochelin locus. Thus, green-beard cooperation is subdued by competition, indicating that inter-specific siderophore cooperation is difficult to evolve and to be maintained.",

Previous studies focus on signaling mechanisms of hair cell regeneration, such as Wnt and Notch signals but seldom on the fact that the beginning of regeneration is accompanied by a large number of inflammatory responses. The detailed role of this inflammation in hair cell regeneration is still unknown. In addition, there is no appropriate behavioral method to quantitatively evaluate the functional recovery of lateral line hair cells after regeneration.\n\nResultsIn this study, we found that when inflammation was suppressed, the regeneration of lateral line hair cells and the recovery of the rheotaxis of the larvae were significantly delayed. Calcium imaging showed that the function of the neuromasts in the inflammation-inhibited group was weaker than that in the non-inflammation-inhibited group at the Early Stage of regeneration, and returned to normal at the Late Stage. Calcium imaging also revealed the cause of the mismatch between the function and quantity during regeneration.\n\nConclusionsOur results, meanwhile, suggest that suppressing inflammation delays hair cell regeneration and functional recovery when hair cells are damaged. This study may provide a new knowledge for how to promote hair cell regeneration and functional recovery in adult mammals.",

    "abstract": "Doggerland was a land mass occupying an area currently covered by the North Sea until marine inundation took place during the mid-Holocene, ultimately separating the British land mass from the rest of Europe. The Storegga Slide, which triggered a tsunami reflected in sediment deposits in the Northern North Sea, North East coastlines of the British Isles and across the North Atlantic, was a major event during this transgressive phase. The spatial extent of the Storegga tsunami however remains unconfirmed because to date no direct evidence for the event has been recovered from the southern North Sea. We present evidence that Storegga associated deposits occur in the southern North Sea. Palaeo-river systems have been identified using seismic survey in the southwestern North Sea and sedimentary cores extracted to track the Mid Holocene inundation. At the head of one palaeo-river system near the Outer Dowsing Deep, the Southern River, we observed an abrupt and catastrophic inundation stratum. Based on lithostratigraphic, macro and microfossils and sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) evidence, supported by optical stimulation luminescence (OSL) and radiocarbon dating, we conclude these deposits were a result of the Storegga event. Seismic identification of this stratum to adjacent cores indicated diminished traces of the tsunami, largely removed by subsequent erosional processes. Our results demonstrate the catastrophic impact of Storegga within this area of the Southern North Sea, but indicate that these effects were temporary and likely localized and mitigated by the dense woodland and topography of the area. We conclude clear physical remnants of the wave are likely to be restricted to inland basins and incised river valley systems.",

The fiber courses in the tendon have profound effects on the distribution of stress along and across the insertion. We tracked fibers of the Achilles tendon in mice in micro-computed tomographies and extracted virtual transversal sections. The fiber tracks and shapes were analyzed from a position in the free tendon to the insertion with regard to their mechanical consequences. The fiber number was found to stay about constant along the tendon. But the fiber cross-sectional areas decrease towards the insertion. The fibers mainly interact due to tendon twist, while branching only creates small branching clusters with low levels of divergence along the tendon. The highest fiber curvatures were found within the unmineralized entheseal fibrocartilage. The fibers inserting at a protrusion of the insertion area form a distinct portion within the tendon. Tendon twist is expected to contribute to a homogeneous distribution of stress among the fibers. According to the low cross-sectional areas and the high fiber curvatures, tensile and compressive stress are expected to peak at the insertion. These findings raise the question whether the insertion is reinforced in terms of fiber strength or by other load-bearing components besides the fibers.",

    "abstract": "Recently developed silicon probes have large numbers of recording electrodes on long linear shanks. Specifically, Neuropixels probes have 960 recording electrodes distributed over 9.6 mm shanks. Because of their length, Neuropixels probe recordings in rodents naturally span multiple brain areas. Typical studies collate recordings across several recording sessions and animals. Neurons recorded in different sessions and animals have to be aligned to each other and to a standardized brain coordinate system. Here we report a workflow for accurate localization of individual electrodes in standardized coordinates and aligned across individual brains. This workflow relies on imaging brains with fluorescent probe tracks and warping 3-dimensional image stacks to standardized brain atlases. Electrophysiological features are then used to anchor particular electrodes along the reconstructed tracks to specific locations in the brain atlas and therefore to specific brain structures. We performed ground-truth experiments, in which motor cortex outputs are labelled with ChR2 and a fluorescence protein. Recording from brain regions targeted by these outputs reveals better than 100 m accuracy for electrode localization.",

    "abstract": "Strictly maternal inheritance and lack of intermolecular recombination of the human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) are the assumed preconditions for molecular evolution studies, phylogenetic reconstruction and population genetic analyses. This hypothesis, however, has been challenged by investigations providing evidence for genetic recombination of mtDNA, thus sparking controversy. Using single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology, we sequenced the entire mtDNA from blood and fibroblast cells from five individuals with biparental mtDNA transmission in three separate, multiple-generation families. After phasing the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes of mtDNA, no intermolecular recombination between paternal and maternal mtDNA was found when the mtDNA was transmitted in either biparental or maternal mode. Our study provides support for the argument that intermolecular mtDNA recombination is absent or extremely rare in humans. As a consequence, these results support the feasibility of mtDNA-based molecular evolution studies and phylogenetic and population genetic analyses for humans, while also avoiding inaccurate phylogenetic inferences and incorrect rejection of the molecular clock.",

    "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) entry into cells is mediated by its spike glycoprotein (GP). Following attachment and internalization, virions traffic to late endosomes where GP is cleaved by host cysteine proteases. Cleaved GP then binds its cellular receptor, Niemann-Pick C1. In response to an unknown cellular trigger, GP undergoes conformational rearrangements that drive fusion of viral and endosomal membranes . The temperature-dependent stability (thermostability) of the pre-fusion conformers of  Class I viral fusion glycoproteins, including those of filovirus GPs, has provided insights into their propensity to undergo fusion-related rearrangements. However, previously described assays have relied on soluble glycoprotein ectodomains. Here, we developed a simple ELISA-based assay that uses the temperature-dependent loss of conformational epitopes to measure thermostability of GP embedded in viral membranes. The base and glycan cap subdomains of all filovirus GPs tested suffered a concerted loss of pre-fusion conformation at elevated temperatures, but did so at different temperature ranges, indicating virus-specific differences in thermostability. Despite these differences, all of these GPs displayed reduced thermostability upon cleavage to GPCL. Surprisingly, acid pH enhanced, rather than decreased, GP thermostability, suggesting it could enhance viral survival in hostile endo/lysosomal compartments. Finally, we confirmed and extended previous findings that some small-molecule inhibitors of filovirus entry destabilize EBOV GP and uncovered evidence that the most potent inhibitors act through multiple mechanisms. We establish the epitope-loss ELISA as a useful tool for studies of filovirus entry, engineering of GP variants with enhanced stability for use in vaccine development, and discovery of new stability-modulating antivirals.\n\nImportanceThough a vaccine for Ebola virus has been approved by the FDA within the past year, no FDA-approved therapeutics are available to treat infections by Ebola virus or other filoviruses. The development of such countermeasures is challenged by our limited understanding of the mechanism by which Ebola virus enters cells, especially at the final step of membrane fusion. The sole surface-exposed viral protein, GP, mediates key steps in virus entry, including membrane fusion, and undergoes major structural rearrangements during this process. The stability of GP at elevated temperatures (thermostability) can provide insights into its capacity to undergo these structural rearrangements. Here, we describe a new assay that uses GP-specific antibodies to measure GP thermostability under a variety of conditions relevant to viral entry. We show that proteolytic cleavage and acid pH have significant effects on GP thermostability that shed light on their respective roles in viral entry. We also show that the assay can be used to study how small-molecule entry inhibitors affect GP stability. This work provides a simple and readily accessible assay to engineer forms of GP with enhanced stability that could be useful as part of an antiviral vaccine and to discover and improve drugs that act by modulating the stability of GP.",

    "abstract": "Oxytocin orchestrates social and emotional behaviors through modulation of neural circuits in brain structures such as the central amygdala (CeA). The long-standing dogma is that oxytocin signaling in the central nervous system occurs exclusively via direct actions on neurons. However, several findings over the last decades showed that astrocytes actively participate in the modulation of neuronal circuits. Here, we investigate the degree of astrocytes involvement in oxytocin functions. Using astrocyte specific gain and loss of function approaches, we demonstrate that CeA astrocytes not only directly respond to oxytocin, but are actually necessary for its effects on neuronal circuits and ultimately behavior. Our work identifies astrocytes as a crucial cellular substrate underlying the promotion of a positive emotional state by oxytocin. These results further corroborate that astrocytes are key regulators of neuronal circuits activity by responding to specific neuropeptidergic inputs, and opens up new perspectives to understand how neuromodulators gate brain functions.",

Actual effort exertion correlates with activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and noradrenergic pupil dilation, but little is known about how these neurophysiological processes guide decisions about future efforts: They may either provide anticipatory energization helping to accept the challenge, or a cost representation weighted against expected rewards. Here we provide evidence for the former, by measuring pupil and fMRI brain responses while humans chose whether to exert efforts to obtain rewards. Pupil-dilation rate and dMPFC fMRI activity related to anticipated effort level, with stronger correlations when participants chose to accept the challenge. These choice-dependent effort representations were stronger in participants whose behavioral choices were more sensitive to effort. Our results identify a process involving the peripheral and central human nervous system that guides decisions to exert effort by simulating the required energization.",

    "abstract": "Standard diffusion MRI model with intra- and extra-axonal water pools offers a set of microstructural parameters describing brain white matter architecture. However, a non-linearity of the general model and diffusion data contamination by noise and imaging artefacts make estimation of diffusion metrics challenging. In order to develop reproducible and reliable diffusion approaches and to avoid computational model degeneracy, one needs to devise additional theoretical assumptions allowing a stable numerical implementation. As a result, it is possible to estimate intra-axonal water fraction (AWF) representing one of the important structural parameters. AWF can be treated as an indirect measure of axon density and has a strong potential as useful clinical biomarker. A few diffusion approaches such as white matter tract integrity, neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging, and spherical mean technique, allow one to evaluate AWF in the frame of their theoretical assumptions. In the present study, we considered the compatibility of axon density metrics obtained from different diffusion models and the influence of the diffusion metric on a brain asymmetry estimation in UK Biobank sample consisting of 182 subjects. We found AWF derived from a spherical mean technique is the most statistically representative measure. As a result, we revealed that brain asymmetry indecies derived from intra-axonal water fraction weakly decrease along the lifespan, reducing the left-right hemisphere difference within increased age.",

Some parents experiences may not only affect the phenotype of parents but also alter the reaction to environmental impacts in the offspring. The aim of this study is to investigate consequences of maternal separation stress in female first generation of mice whose parents were exposed to maternal separation stress. Maternal separation in pups was performed during post-natal days (PND) 2 to 14. Then, female pups of the first-generation were used in present study. The histological changes in ovaries, ROS production (using DCFH-DA assay), mRNA expression of NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1, TLR4, BAX, BCL2 and TNF genes (using RT-PCR), levels of IL-18, IL-1{beta}, ATP and GPx (using ELISA) and also protein expression of caspase-3 and NLRP3 (using immunocytochemistry) were assessed. Our findings showed that maternal separation stress experienced by parents significantly affects the numbers of primordial and primary follicles. Furthermore, ROS production increased and concentrations of ATP and GPx reduced in the first generation. Also, expression of cytokines and genes involved in inflammation and apoptosis including NLRP3, caspase-1, TLR4, TNF, IL-1{beta}, IL-18 and BCL2 were significantly affected in the first generation. Our results also showed that this stress significantly increased percentage of caspase-3 and NLRP3 positive cells in the ovarian tissue of the first generation. Our findings suggest that maternal separation stress experienced by parents may influence activation of inflammatory response in the ovarian tissue of their first generation which may induce apoptosis and consequently disturb folliculogenesis process.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionOxidative stress is considered an essential mechanism in ICU-acquired weakness. The roles of oxidative stress in autophagy/mitophagy dysfunction remains elusive. Microtubule serves as an essential guide rail for auto/mitophagosome trafficking required for proper maturation of auto/mitophagosomes in normal circumstances, and microtubules network formation is regulated by signal transduction mechanisms involving Akt, GSK3{beta}, and the microtubule plus-end tracking molecule, EB1. We have investigated (1) whether oxidative stress affects this pathway, leading to the defective mitophagy response, and (2) whether trehalose, an auto/mitophagy modulator, can ameliorate these pathological conditions.\n\nMethodsBy stably transfecting markers for auto/mitophagy or MT synthesis, we have established a few new C2C12 myocyte cell lines, expressing, GFP-LC3, EB1-GFP, and/or tandem-fluorescence LC3 (tfLC3). To monitor microtubule network, the cells were stained by SiR-tubulin. The cells were cultured in the presence or absence of oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and treated with or without trehalose. The response of mitophagy parameters including vesicle motion and the maturation status was monitored by stimulating the cells with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), an established mitophagy inducer, under a time-lapse confocal microscopy. Signal transduction mechanisms linking mitophagy to microtubule formation was analyzed by Western Blotting against Akt and GSK3{beta}.\n\nResultsCells under the oxidative stress, showed abolished MT network formation, decreased microtubule synthesis by EB1, and a decrease in CCCP-invoked response of mitophagosome motion, perturbed mitophagosome maturation, and increased superoxide production. Signal resistance of Akt/GSK3{beta} pathway to mitophagic stimulation, was documented. Trehalose treatment reversed signal resistance, diminished MT synthesis, ameliorated the disturbed MT network, and improved maturation defects, suppressing the production of superoxide.\n\nConclusionsOxidative stress decreases the response of mitophagy and abolishes microtubule network. Trehalose improves the synthetic ability of microtubule and normalized the disturbed microtubule network, resulting in the improvement of the perturbed mitophagosomes maturation under the oxidative stress.",

    "abstract": "Old-growth forests play a major role in conserving biodiversity, protecting water resources, sequestrating carbon, and these forests are indispensable resources for indigenous societies. To preserve the ecosystem services provided by these boreal ecosystems, it becomes necessary to develop novel silvicultural practices capable of emulating the natural dynamics and structural attributes of old-growth forests. The success of these forest management strategies depends on developing an accurate understanding of natural regeneration dynamics. Our goal was therefore to identify the main patterns and the drivers involved in the regeneration dynamics of old-growth forests, placing our focus on boreal stands dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (L.) Mill.) and balsam fir (Balsam fir (L.) Mill.) in eastern Canada. We sampled 71 stands in a 2200 km2 study area located within Quebecs boreal region. For each stand, we noted tree regeneration (seedlings and saplings), structural attributes (diameter distribution, deadwood volume, etc.), and abiotic (topography and soil) factors. We observed that secondary disturbance regimes and topographic constraints were the main drivers of balsam fir and black spruce regeneration. Furthermore, the regeneration dynamics of black spruce appeared more complex than those of balsam fir. We observed distinct phases of seedling production first developing within the understory, then seedling growth when gaps opened in the canopy, followed by progressive canopy closure. Seedling density, rather than the sapling density, had a major role in explaining the ability of black spruce to fill the canopy following a secondary disturbance. The density of balsam fir seedlings and saplings was also linked to the abundance of balsam fir trees at the stand level. This research helps explain the complexity of old-growth forest dynamics where many ecological factors interact at multiple temporal and spatial scales. This study also improves our understanding of ecological processes within native old-growth forests and identifies the key factors to consider when ensuring the sustainable management of old-growth boreal stands.",

    "abstract": "Conservation efforts are increasingly being challenged by a rapidly changing environment, and for some aquatic species the use of captive rearing or selective breeding is an attractive option. However, captivity itself can impose unintended artificial selection known as domestication selection (adaptation to culture conditions). For most marine species, it is not known to what degree domestication selection affects traits related to fitness in the wild. To test for domestication selection in a marine bivalve, we focused on a fitness-related trait (larval starvation resistance) that could be altered under artificial selection. Using larvae produced from a wild population of Crassostrea virginica and a selectively bred, disease-resistant line we measured growth and survival during starvation versus standard algal diet (control) conditions. Larvae from both lineages showed a remarkable resilience to food limitation, possibly mediated by an ability to uptake and utilize dissolved organic matter for somatic maintenance. Water chemistry analysis showed dissolved organic carbon in filtered tank water to be at concentrations similar to natural river water. We observed that survival in larvae produced from the aquaculture line was significantly lower compared to larvae produced from wild broodstock (8 {+/-} 3% and 21 {+/-} 2%, respectively) near the end of a 10-day period with no food (phytoplankton). All larval cohorts had arrested growth during the starvation period and took at least two days to recover once food was reintroduced before resuming growth. Phenotypic differences between the wild and aquaculture lines suggest potential differences in the capacity to sustain extended food limitation, but this work requires replication with multiple selection lines and wild populations to make more general inferences about domestication selection. With this contribution we explore the potential for domestication selection in bivalves, discuss the physiological and fitness implications of reduced starvation tolerance, and aim to inspire further research on the topic.",

We evaluated 254 elderly patients; all the participants underwent tongue ultrasonography and tongue pressure measurement. To determine tongue thickness, we measured the vertical distance from the surface of the mylohyoid muscle to the tongue dorsum using ultrasonography. Result analyses revealed that tongue thickness was linearly associated with tongue pressure in both sexes. In male participants, dyslipidemia, lower leg circumference, and tongue pressure were independently significantly associated with tongue thickness. In female participants, body mass index and tongue pressure were independently significantly associated with tongue thickness. Tongue thickness was significantly decreased by age for both men and women. The optimal cutoff for tongue thickness to predict the tongue pressure of < 20 kPa was 41.3 mm in males, and 39.3 mm in females. In the Japanese elderly, tongue thickness using ultrasonography is associated with tongue pressure. Tongue thickness and tongue pressure, which are sensitive markers for oral frailty, decrease in aging.

Genotypes WGI 126, TT-1 and MS 841B responded positively towards high temperature stress for transcript accumulation for both Pgcp 70 and Pghsf and also had better growth under heat stress, whereas PPMI 69 showed the least responsiveness to transcript induction supporting the membrane stability index data for scoring thermotolerance, suggesting the efficacy of transcript expression profiling as a molecular based screening technique for identification of thermotolerant genes and genotypes at particular crop growth stages. As to demonstrate this, a full length cDNA of Pghsp 16.97 was cloned from the thermotolerant cultivar, WGI 126 and characterized for thermotolerance. The results of demonstration set forth the transcript profiling for heat tolerant genes can be a very useful technique for high throughput screening of tolerant genotypes at molecular level from large cultivar collections at seedling stage.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 300 different types of blood groups are identified so far, the ABO and Rh antigens are still the clinically most significant and genetically most polymorphic of all human blood group systems to date. A total of 200 unrelated individuals from Uttar Pradesh were studied for the phenotype and allele frequency distribution of ABO and Rh (D) blood groups. In total 200 samples analyzed, phenotype B blood type has the highest frequency 36.5% (n=73), followed by O (34.5%; n=69), A (20.5%; n=41) and AB (8.5%; n=17). The O, A and B frequencies were 0.5849, 0.1571 and 0.2580 respectively. The overall phenotypic frequencies of ABO blood groups were B>O>A>AB. The variation in phenotypic frequencies between male and female might be due to small sample size of male sample. The allelic frequency of Rh-negative was 0.2.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe identification of immune receptors in crop plants is time-consuming but important for disease control. Previously, resistance gene enrichment sequencing (RenSeq) was developed to accelerate mapping of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) genes. However, resistances mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) remain less utilised.\nC_LIO_LIHere, our pipeline shows accelerated mapping of PRRs. Effectoromics leads to precise identification of plants with target PRRs, and subsequent RLP/K enrichment sequencing (RLP/KSeq) leads to detection of informative SNPs that are linked to the trait.\nC_LIO_LIUsing Phytophthora infestans as a model, we identified Solanum microdontum plants that recognize the apoplastic effectors INF1 or SCR74. RLP/KSeq in a segregating Solanum population confirmed the localization of the INF1 receptor on chromosome 12, and lead to the rapid mapping of the response to SCR74 to chromosome 9. By using markers obtained from RLP/KSeq in conjunction with additional markers, we fine-mapped the SCR74 receptor to a 43-kbp G-LecRK locus.\nC_LIO_LIOur findings show that RLP/KSeq enables rapid mapping of PRRs and is especially beneficial for crop plants with large and complex genomes. This work will enable the elucidation and characterisation of the non-NLR plant immune receptors and ultimately facilitate informed resistance breeding.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The Drug Toxicity Signature Generation Center (DToxS) at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is one of the centers of the NIH Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) program. A key aim of DToxS is to generate both proteomic and transcriptomic signatures that can predict adverse effects, especially cardiotoxicity, of kinase inhibitors approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Towards this goal, high throughput shot-gun proteomics experiments (317 cell line/drug combinations + 64 control lysates) have been conducted at the Center for Advanced Proteomics Research at Rutgers University - New Jersey Medical School. Using computational network analyses, these proteomic data can be integrated with transcriptomic signatures generated in tandem to identify cellular signatures of cardiotoxicity that may predict kinase inhibitor-induced toxicity and possible mitigation. Both raw and processed proteomics data have been carefully screened for quality and made publicly available via the PRIDE database. As such, this broad protein kinase inhibitor-stimulated cardiomyocyte proteomic data and signature set is valuable for the prediction of drug toxicities.\n\nLinks to: Metadata Tables\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cda9f8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1520e05org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16a35borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3ee6e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a98664_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",
