    "abstract": "Plants are colonised by millions of microorganisms representing thousands of species with varying effects on plant growth and health. The microbial communities found on plants are compositionally consistent and their overall positive effect on the plant is well known. However, the effects of individual microbiota members on plant hosts and vice versa, as well as the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we describe  Litterbox, a highly controlled system to investigate plant-microbe interactions. Plants were grown gnotobiotically on zeolite-clay, an excellent soil replacement that retains enough moisture to avoid subsequent watering. Plants grown on zeolite phenotypically resemble plants grown under environmental conditions. Further, bacterial densities on leaves in the Litterbox system resembled those in temperate environments. A PDMS sheet was used to cover the zeolite, thereby significantly lowering the bacterial load in the zeolite and rhizosphere. This reduced the likelihood of potential systemic responses in leaves induced by microbial rhizosphere colonisation. We present results of example experiments studying the transcriptional responses of leaves to defined microbiota members and the spatial distribution of bacteria on leaves. We anticipate that this versatile and affordable plant growth system will promote microbiota research and help in elucidating plant-microbe interactions and their underlying mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Spreading dynamics analysis is an important and interesting topic since it has many applications such as rumor or disease controlling, viral marketing and information recommending. Many state-of-the-art researches focus on predicting infection scale or threshold. Few researchers pay attention to the predicting of infection nodes from a snapshot. With developing of precision marketing, recommending and, controlling, how to predict infection nodes precisely from snapshot becomes a key issue in spreading dynamics analysis. In this paper, a probability based prediction model is presented so as to estimate the infection nodes from a snapshot of spreading. Experimental results on synthetic and real networks demonstrate that the model proposed could predict the infection nodes precisely in the sense of probability.",

    "abstract": "Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease which kills 300,000 people every year in developing countries and there is no vaccine. Recently, we have shown that cholinesterases (ChEs) - enzymes that regulate neurotransmission - from Schistosoma mansoni are expressed on the tegument and present in the excretory/secretory products of schistosomula and adult worms, and are essential for parasite survival in the definitive host, highlighting their utility as potential schistosomiasis vaccine targets. When treated in vitro with anti-SmChE IgG, both schistosomula and adult worms displayed significantly decreased ChE activity, which eventually resulted in parasite death. Vaccination with individual SmChEs, or a combination of all three SmChEs, significantly reduced worm burdens in two independent trials compared to controls. Liver egg burdens were significantly decreased for all vaccinated mice across both trials (13% - 46%) except for those vaccinated with SmAChE1 in trial 1. Egg viability, as determined by egg hatching from liver homogenates, was significantly reduced in the groups vaccinated with the SmChE cocktail (40%) and SmAChE2 (46%). Further, surviving worms from each vaccinated group were significantly stunted and depleted of glycogen stores, compared to controls. These results suggest that SmChEs could be incorporated into a vaccine against schistosomiasis to reduce the pathology and transmission of this debilitating disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroudHantaan virus (HTNV), as one of the pathogenic hantaviruses of HFRS, has raised serious concerns in Eurasia. China and its neighbors, especially Russia and South Korea, are seriously suffered HTNV infections. Recent studies reported genetic diversity and phylogenetic features of HTNV in different parts of China, but the analyses from the holistic perspective are rare.\n\nMethodology and Principal FindingsTo better understand HTNV genetic diversity and dynamics, we analyzed all available complete sequences derived from the S and M segments with bio-informatic tools. Our study revealed 11 phylogroups and sequences showed obvious geographic clustering. We found 42 significant amino acid variants sites and 18 of them located in immune epitopes. Nine recombination events and seven reassortment isolates were deteced in our study. Sequences from Guizhou were highly genetic divergent, characterized by the emergence of multiple lineages, recombination and reassortment events. We found that HTNV probably emerged in Zhejiang about 1,000 years ago and the population size expanded from 1980s to 1990s. Bayesian stochastic search variable selection analysis revealed that Heilongjiang, Shaanxi and Guizhou played important roles in HTNV evolution and migration.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThese findings reveal the original and evolution features of HTNV which might assist in understanding Hantavirus epidemics and would be useful for disease prevention and control.\n\nAuthor summaryHemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) and Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) are endemic zoonotic infectious diseases caused by hantaviruses that belong to the Family Bunyaviridae. Hantaviruses have gained worldwide attention as etiological agents of emerging zoonotic diseases, with fatality rates ranging from <10% up to 60%. However, our knowledge about the emergence and evolution of HTNV is limited. To get more information about HTNV genetic diversity and phylogenetic features in holistic perspective, we investigated the genetic diversity and spatial distribution of HTNV using all available whole genomic sequences of S and M segments. We also gain insights into the genetic diversity and spatial-temporal dynamics of HTNV. These data can augment traditional approach to infectious disease surveillance and control.",

    "abstract": "In genome evolution, genetic variants are the source of diversity, which natural selection acts upon. Treatment of human tuberculosis (TB) induces a strong selection pressure for the emergence of antibiotic resistance in the infecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) strains. MTB evolution in response to treatment has been intensively studied and mainly attributed to point substitutions. However, the contribution of insertions and deletions (indels) to MTB genome evolution remains poorly understood. Here, we analyzed a multi-drug resistant MTB outbreak for the presence of high-quality indels and substitutions. We find that indels are significantly enriched in genes conferring antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, we show that indels are inherited during the outbreak and follow a molecular clock with an evolutionary rate of 5.37e-9 indels/site/year, which is 23x lower compared to the substitution rate. Inherited indels may co-occur with substitutions in genes along related biological pathways; examples are iron storage and resistance to second-line antibiotics. This suggests that epistatic interactions between indels and substitutions affect antibiotic resistance and compensatory evolution in MTB.\n\nAuthor summaryMycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a human pathogen causing millions of deaths every year. Its genome evolution has been intensively characterized through point substitutions, i.e., nucleotide exchanges that are inherited. Additional mutations are short or long insertions and deletions of nucleotides, termed indels. Short indels in genes might change the reading frame and disrupt the gene product. Here we show that antibiotic treatment has a strong impact on indel evolution in an MTB outbreak. Namely, indels occur frequently in genes causing antibiotic resistance upon disruption. Furthermore, we show that the molecular clock, i.e., the temporal emergence of variants over time, holds for short indels in MTB genomes. Finally, we observe that indels may co-occur with substitutions in genes along related biological pathways. These results support the notion that indels are important contributors to MTB evolution. We anticipate that including indels in the analyses of MTB outbreaks will improve our understanding of antibiotic resistance evolution.",

    "abstract": "Dream reports collected after rapid eye movement sleep (REM) awakenings are, on average, longer, more vivid, bizarre, emotional and story-like compared to those collected after non-REM. However, a comparison of the word-to-word structural organization of dream reports is lacking, and traditional measures that distinguish REM and non-REM dreaming may be confounded by report length. This problem is amenable to the analysis of dream reports as non-semantic directed word graphs, which provide a structural assessment of oral reports, while controlling for individual differences in verbosity. Against this background, the present study had two main aims: Firstly, to investigate differences in graph structure between REM and non-REM dream reports, and secondly, to evaluate how non-semantic directed word graph analysis compares to the widely used measure of report length in dream analysis. To do this, we analyzed a set of 125 dream reports obtained from 19 participants in controlled laboratory awakenings from REM and N2 sleep. We found that: (1) graphs from REM sleep possess a larger connectedness compared to those from N2; (2) measures of graph structure can predict ratings of dream complexity, where increases in connectedness and decreases in randomness are observed in relation to increasing dream report complexity; and (3) measures of the Largest Connected Component of a graph can improve a model containing report length in predicting sleep stage and dream complexity. These results indicate that dream reports sampled after REM awakening have on average a larger connectedness compared to those sampled after N2 (i.e. words recur with a longer range), a difference which appears to be related to underlying differences in dream complexity. Altogether, graph analysis represents a promising method for dream research, due to its automated nature and potential to complement report length in dream analysis.",

    "abstract": "Early branching eukaryotes have been used as models to study the evolution of cellular molecular processes. Strikingly, human parasite of the Trypanosomatidae family (T. brucei, T. cruzi and L. major) conserve the complex machinery responsible for selenocysteine biosynthesis and incorporation in selenoproteins (SELENOK/SelK, SELENOT/SelT and SELENOTryp/SelTryp), although these proteins do not seem to be essential for parasite viability under laboratory controlled conditions. Selenophosphate synthetase (SEPHS/SPS) plays an indispensable role in selenium metabolism, being responsible for catalyzing the formation of selenophosphate, the biological selenium donor for selenocysteine synthesis. We solved the crystal structure of the L. major selenophosphate synthetase and confirmed that its dimeric organization is functionally important throughout the domains of life. We also demonstrated its interaction with selenocysteine lyase (SCLY) and showed that it is not present in other stable complexes involved in the selenocysteine pathway, namely the phosphoseryl-tRNASec kinase (PSTK)-Sec-tRNASec synthase (SEPSECS) and the tRNASec-specific elongation factor (eEFSec)-ribosome. Endoplasmic reticulum stress with ditiothreitol (DTT) or tunicamycin upon selenophosphate synthetase ablation in procyclic T. brucei cells led to a growth defect. On the other hand, only DTT presented a negative effect in bloodstream T. brucei expressing selenophosphate synthetase-RNAi. Although selenoprotein T (SELENOT) was dispensable for both forms of the parasite, SELENOT-RNAi procyclic T. brucei cells were sensitive to DTT. Together, our data suggest a role for the T. brucei selenophosphate synthetase in regulation of the parasites ER stress response.\n\nSynopsisSelenium is both a toxic compound and a micronutrient. As a micronutrient, it participates in the synthesis of specific proteins, selenoproteins, as the amino acid selenocysteine. The synthesis of selenocysteine is present in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. The protozoa parasites of the Trypanosomatidae family, that cause major tropical diseases, conserve the complex machinery responsible for selenocysteine biosynthesis and incorporation in selenoproteins. However, this pathway has been considered dispensable for the protozoa cells. This has intrigued us, and lead to question that if maintained in the cell it should be under selective pressure and therefore be necessary. Also, since the intermediate products of selenocysteine synthesis are toxic to the cell, it has been proposed that these compounds need to be sequestered from the cytoplasm. Therefore, extensive and dynamic protein-protein interactions must happen to deliver those intermediates along the pathway. In this study we have investigated the molecular and structural interactions of different proteins involved in selenocystein synthesis and describe its involvement in the endoplasmic reticulum protection to oxidative stress. Our results also show how the interaction of different proteins leads to the protection of the cell against the toxic effects of seleium compounds during selenocysteine synthesis.",

    "abstract": "The capability of cortical regions to flexibly sustain an \"ignited\" state of activity has been discussed in relation to conscious perception or hierarchical information processing. Here, we investigate how the intrinsic propensity of different regions to get ignited is determined by the specific topological organisation of the structural connectome. More specifically, we simulated the resting-state dynamics of mean-field whole-brain models and assessed how dynamic multi-stability and ignition differ between a reference model embedding a realistic human connectome, and alternative models based on a variety of randomised connectome ensembles. We found that the strength of global excitation needed to first trigger ignition in a subset of regions is substantially smaller for the model embedding the empirical human connectome. Furthermore, when increasing the strength of excitation, the propagation of ignition outside of this initial core -which is able to self-sustain its high activity- is way more gradual than for any of the randomised connectomes, allowing for graded control of the number of ignited regions. We explain both these assets in terms of the exceptional weighed core-shell organisation of the empirical connectome, speculating that this topology of human structural connectivity may be attuned to support an enhanced ignition dynamic.\n\nAuthor summaryThe activity of the cortex in mammals constantly fluctuates in relation to cognitive tasks, but also during rest. The ability of brain regions to display ignition, a fast transition from low to high activity is central for the emergence of conscious perception and decision making. Here, using a biophysically inspired model of cortical activity, we show how the structural organization of human cortex supports and constrains the rise of this ignited dynamics in spontaneous cortical activity. We found that the weighted core-shell organization of the human connectome allows for a uniquely graded ignition. This graded ignition implies a smooth control of the ignition in cortical areas tuned by the global excitability. The smooth control cannot be replicated by surrogate connectomes, even though they conserve key local or global network properties. Indeed, the first trigger of ignition in the human cortex has the lowest global excitability and corresponds with the strongest interconnected areas, the ignition core. Finally, we suggest developmental and evolutionary constraints of the mesoscale organization that support this enhanced ignition dynamics in cortical activity.",

    "abstract": "HIV cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) escape is defined by a concentration of HIV-1 RNA in CSF above the lower limit of quantification of the employed assay and equal to or greater than the plasma HIV-1 RNA level in the presence of treatment-related plasma viral suppression, while CSF discordance is similarly defined by equal or higher CSF than plasma HIV-1 RNA in untreated individuals. During secondary CSF escape or discordance disproportionate CSF HIV-1 RNA develops in relation to another infection in addition to HIV-1. We performed a retrospective review of people living with HIV receiving clinical care at Sahlgrenska Infectious Diseases Clinic in Gothenburg, Sweden who developed uncomplicated herpes zoster (HZ) and underwent a research lumbar puncture (LP) within the ensuing 150 days. Based on treatment status and the relationship between CSF and plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations, they were divided into 4 groups: i) antiretroviral treated with CSF escape (N=4), ii) treated without CSF escape (N=5), iii) untreated with CSF discordance (N=8), and iv) untreated without CSF discordance (N=8). We augmented these with two additional cases of secondary CSF escape related to neuroborreliosis and HSV-2 encephalitis and analyzed these two non-HZ cases for factors contributing to CSF HIV-1 RNA concentrations. HIV-1 CSF escape and discordance were associated with higher CSF white blood cell (WBC) counts than their non-escape (P=0.0087) and non-discordant (P=0.0017) counterparts, and the CSF WBC counts correlated with the CSF HIV-1 RNA levels in both the treated (P=0.0047) and untreated (P=0.002) group pairs. Moreover, the CSF WBC counts correlated with the CSF:plasma HIV-1 RNA ratios of the entire group of 27 subjects (P=<0.0001) indicating a strong effect of the CSF WBC count on the relation of the CSF to plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations across the entire sample set. The inflammatory response to HZ and its augmenting effect on CSF HIV-1 RNA was found up to 5 months after the HZ outbreak in the cross-sectional sample and, was present for one year after HZ in one individual followed longitudinally. We find that HZ provides a  model of secondary CSF escape and discordance. Likely, the inflammatory response to HZ pathology within the CNS provoked local HIV-1 production by enhanced trafficking or activation of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes. Whereas treatment and other systemic factors determined the plasma HIV-1 RNA concentrations, in this setting the CSF WBC counts established the relation of the CSF HIV-1 RNA levels to this plasma set-point.\n\nAuthor summaryHerpes zoster is a neurotropic infection common in people living with HIV. We studied if herpes zoster caused alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid viral (CSF) load when compared with blood levels in patients with and without antiretroviral treatment by studies of the cerebrospinal fluid. HIV-1 CSF escape and discordance were associated with higher CSF white blood cell counts than their non-escape (P=0.0087) and non-discordant (P=0.0017) counterparts, and the CSF white blood cell counts correlated with the CSF HIV-1 RNA levels in both the treated (P=0.0047) and untreated (P=0.002) group pairs. We found that the inflammatory response to herpes zoster pathology within the CSF provoked local HIV-1 production by enhanced trafficking or activation of HIV-1-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes. We suggest that herpes zoster provides a  model of secondary HIV CSF escape and HIV CSF/blood discordance, which increase the understanding of HIV central nervous system infection and might be of importance for eradication trials in sanctuary sites such as the central nervous system.",
