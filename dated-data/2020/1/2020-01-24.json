    "abstract": "Human gremlin-1 is a physiologically versatile signaling molecule that has been associated with several human diseases including cancer. The ability of gremlin-1 to induce fibrosis in organs and transduce angiogenesis makes it a target for cancer therapy. RNAi-based therapy has proven to be very efficient and specific in tumor growth inhibition. The efficacy and specificity of siRNA-mediated gene silencing depends on the designing approaches. Here, empirical guidelines for siRNA design and comprehensive target site availability analysis were used to select effective siRNA from a plethora of potential candidates designed using several computation algorithms. Then, the selected siRNA candidates were subjected to stringent similarity searches in order to obtain siRNA candidates with reduced off-target effects (high specificity). The best candidates were compared to experimentally successful gremlin-1 siRNAs in order to predict the silencing potency of the selected siRNAs. siRNA-6 (sense strand: 5-CCAAGAAAUUCACUACCAU-3), siRNA-7 (sense strand: 5-CCAUGAUGGUCACACUCAA-3) and siRNA-47 (sense strand: 5-GGCCCAGCACAAUGACUCA-3) were predicted to be highly effective siRNA candidates for gremlin-1 silencing. These siRNAs can be considered for RNAi-based therapy because off-target effects are predicted to be minimal.",

    "abstract": "The strength of biotic interactions within an ecological community affects the susceptibility of the community to invasion by introduced taxa. In microbial communities, cross-feeding is a widespread type of biotic interaction that has the potential to affect community assembly and stability. Yet, there is little understanding of how the presence of cross-feeding within a community affects invasion risk. Here, I develop a metabolite-explicit model where native microbial taxa interact through both cross-feeding and competition for metabolites. I use this model to study how the strength of biotic interactions, especially cross-feeding, influence whether an introduced taxon can join the community. I found that stronger cross-feeding and competition led to much lower invasion risk, as both types of biotic interactions lead to greater metabolite scarcity for the invader. I also evaluated the impact of a successful invader on community composition and structure. The effect of invaders on the native community was greatest at intermediate levels of cross-feeding; at this \"critical\" level of cross-feeding, successful invaders generally causing decreased diversity, decreased productivity, greater metabolite availability, and decreased quantities of metabolites exchanged among taxa. Furthermore, these changes resulting from a successful primary invader made communities further susceptible to future invaders. The increase in invasion risk was greatest when the network of metabolite exchange between taxa was minimally redundant. Thus, this model demonstrates a case of invasional meltdown that is mediated by initial invaders disrupting the metabolite exchange networks of the native community.",

    "abstract": "Acetogenic bacteria can convert waste gases into fuels and chemicals. Design of bioprocesses for waste carbon valorization requires quantification of steady-state carbon flows. Here, steady-state quantification of autotrophic chemostats containing Clostridium autoethanogenum grown on CO2 and H2 revealed that captured carbon (460 {+/-} 80 mmol/gDCW/day) had a significant distribution to ethanol (54 {+/-} 3 mol% with a 2.4 {+/-} 0.3 g/L titer). We were impressed with this initial result, but also observed limitations to biomass concentration and growth rate. Metabolic modelling predicted culture performance and indicated significant metabolic adjustments when compared to fermentation with CO as the carbon source. Moreover, modelling highlighted flux to pyruvate, and subsequently reduced ferredoxin, as a target for improving CO2 and H2 fermentation. Supplementation with a small amount of CO enabled co-utilisation with CO2, and enhanced CO2 fermentation performance significantly, while maintaining an industrially relevant product profile. Additionally, the highest specific flux through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway was observed during co-utilization of CO2 and CO. Furthermore, the addition of CO led to superior CO2-valorizing characteristics (9.7 {+/-} 0.4 g/L ethanol with a 66 {+/-} 2 mol% distribution, and 540 {+/-} 20 mmol CO2/gDCW/day). Similar industrial processes are commercial or currently being scaled up, indicating CO-supplemented CO2 and H2 fermentation has high potential for sustainable fuel and chemical production. This work also provides a reference dataset to advance our understanding of CO2 gas fermentation, which can contribute to mitigating climate change.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic causes of evolutionary diversification is challenging because differences across species are complex, often involving many genes. However, cases where single or few genetic loci affect a feature that varies dramatically across a radiation of species would provide tractable opportunities to understand the genetics of diversification. Here, we show the diversification of bioluminescent signals in cypridinid ostracods (\"sea fireflies\") to be strongly influenced by a single gene, cypridinid-luciferase. We find different evolutionary processes, including selection, drift, and constraint, each acted on c-luciferase at different times during evolutionary history and impacted different phenotypes, diversifying behavioral signals across species. In particular, some amino acid sites in c-luciferase evolved under episodic diversifying selection, and are associated significantly with phenotypic changes in both enzyme kinetics and color, which impact signals directly. We also find that multiple other amino acid positions in c-luciferase evolved neutrally or under purifying selection and may have impacted the variation of color of bioluminescent signals across genera. This work provides a rare glimpse into the genetic basis of diversification across many species, showing how multiple evolutionary processes may act at different times during a radiation of species to diversify phenotypes. These results indicate not only selection but also drift and constraint may be important evolutionary drivers of species diversification.\n\nSignificance statementA hallmark of life is its astounding diversity. While we are beginning to understand the drivers of biodiversity, uncovering the genetic basis remains challenging. As such, how different molecular evolutionary processes act to diversify phenotypes is a major question in biology. Here we show a single gene to be important in a riotous diversity of fantastical behaviors - the bioluminescent signals of sea fireflies - allowing us to demonstrate multiple evolutionary forces including selection, drift, and constraint contributed to diversification. Our work highlights that not only selection but also neutral processes and constraint have each worked at different times to shape phenotypic diversity.",

However, comprehensive knowledge of DUB function during hematopoiesis in vivo is lacking. To accomplish this goal, we systematically inactivated DUBs in mouse hematopoietic progenitors using in vivo small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) screens. We found that multiple DUBs may be individually required for hematopoiesis and that the ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) is particularly important for the maintenance of murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, Usp15 knockout mice exhibited a reduced HSC pool. The defect was intrinsic to HSCs, as demonstrated by competitive repopulation assays. Importantly, USP15 is highly expressed in normal human hematopoietic cells and leukemias, and USP15 depletion in murine early progenitors and myeloid leukemia cells impaired in vitro expansion and increased genotoxic stress. Our study underscores the importance of DUBs in preserving normal hematopoiesis and uncovers USP15 as a critical DUB in safeguarding genome integrity in HSC and in leukemia cells.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide profiling of nascent RNA has become a fundamental tool to study transcription regulation. Over the past decade, next-generation sequencing has fostered development of a handful of techniques (i.e. GRO-seq, PRO-seq, TT-seq and NET-seq) that map unprocessed transcripts originating from both the coding and the noncoding portion of the genome. Unlike steady-state RNA sequencing, nascent RNA profiling mirrors the real-time activity of RNA Polymerases and provides an accurate readout of transcriptome-wide variations that occur during short time frames (i.e. response to external stimuli or rapid metabolic changes). Some species of nuclear RNAs, albeit functional, have a short half-life and can only be accurately gauged by nascent RNA techniques (i.e. lincRNAs and eRNAs). Furthermore, these techniques capture uncapped post-cleavage RNA at termination sites or promoter-associated antisense RNAs, providing a unique insight into RNAPII dynamics and processivity.\n\nHere we present a run-on assay with 4s-UTP labelling, followed by reversible biotinylation and affinity purification via streptavidin. Our protocol allows streamlined sample preparation within less than 3 days. We named the technique fastGRO (fast Global Run-On). We show that fastGRO is highly reproducible and yields a more complete and extensive coverage of nascent RNA than comparable techniques. Importantly, we demonstrate that fastGRO is scalable and can be performed with as few as 0.5x10^6 cells.",

We have taken the advantage of high throughput next-generation sequencing technique to sequence the complete mitogenome of Yellow-billed babbler (Turdoides affinis), a species endemic to Peninsular India and Sri Lanka. Both, reference-based and de-novo assemblies of mitogenome were performed and observed that de-novo assembled mitogenome was most appropriate. The complete mitogenome of yellow-billed babbler (assembled de-novo) was 17,671 bp in length with 53.2% AT composition. Thirteen protein-coding genes along with 2 rRNAs and 22 tRNAs were detected along with duplicated control regions. The arrangement pattern of these genes was found conserved among Leiothrichidae family mitogenomes. Downstream bioinformatics analysis revealed the effect of translational efficiency and purifying selection pressure over all the thirteen protein-coding genes in yellow-billed babbler mitogenome. Moreover, genetic distance and variation analysis indicated the dominance of NADH dehydrogenase complex-I in the electron transport system of T. affinis. Evolutionary analysis revealed the conserved nature of all the protein-coding genes across Leiothrichidae family mitogenomes. Our limited phylogenetics results suggest that T. affinis is closer to Garrulax.",

    "abstract": "Viruses require host cell metabolites to productively infect, and the mechanisms by which viruses usurp these molecules is diverse. One group of cellular metabolites important in virus infection is the polyamines, small positively-charged molecules involved in cell cycle, translation, and nucleic acid synthesis, among other cellular functions. Polyamines also support replication of diverse viruses, and they are important for processes such as transcription, translation, and viral protein enzymatic activity. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a negative-sense RNA virus that requires polyamines to produce infectious particles. In polyamine depleted conditions, noninfectious particles are produced that interfere with virus replication and stimulate immune signaling. Here, we find that RVFV relies on virion-associated polyamines to maintain infectivity. We show that RVFV replication is facilitated by any of the three biogenic polyamines; however, we specifically find spermidine associated with purified virions. Using a panel of polyamine homologs, we observe that virions can also associate with (R)-3-methylspermidine and norspermidine, though not with other less homologous molecules. Using polyamine reporter cells, we demonstrate that virion-associated polyamines transmit from one infected cell to another. Finally, we find that virions devoid of polyamines are unstable and cannot be supplemented with exogenous polyamines to regain stability or infectivity. These data highlight a unique role for polyamines, and spermidine in particular, in maintaining virus infectivity, a function not previously appreciated. Further, these studies are the first to identify polyamines associated with RVFV virions. Targeting polyamines represents a promising antiviral strategy, and this work highlights a new mechanism by which we can inhibit virus replication through FDA-approved polyamine depleting pharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "Immune evasion and disease progression of Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum are associated with sequence diversity in the hypervariable, putative outer membrane protein TprK. Previous attempts to study variation within TprK have sequenced at depths insufficient to fully appreciate the hypervariable nature of the protein, failed to establish linkage between the proteins 7 variable regions, or were conducted on strains passed through rabbits. As a consequence, a complete profiling of tprK during infection in the human host is still lacking. Furthermore, prior studies examining how T. pallidum uses its repertoire of genomic donor sites to generate diversity within the V regions of the tprK also yielded a partial understanding of this process, due to the limited number of tprK alleles examined. In this study, we used short- and long-read deep sequencing to directly characterize full-length tprK alleles from T. pallidum collected from early lesions of patients attending two STD clinics in Italy. Our data, combined with recent data available on Chinese T. pallidum strains, show the near complete absence of overlap in TprK sequences among the 41 strains profiled to date. Moreover, our data allowed us to redefine the boundaries of tprK V regions, identify 55 donor sites, and estimate the total number of TprK variants that T. pallidum can potentially generate. Altogether, our results support how T. pallidum TprK antigenic variation system is an unsurmountable obstacle for the human immune system to naturally achieve infection eradication, and reiterate the importance of this mechanism for pathogen persistence in the host.\n\nImportanceSyphilis continues to be a significant public health issue in both low- and high-income nations, including the United States, where the number of infectious syphilis cases has increased dramatically over the past five years. T. pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, encodes an outer membrane protein TprK that undergoes segmental gene conversion to constantly create new sequences. We performed deep TprK profiling to understand full-length TprK diversity in T. pallidum-positive clinical specimens and compared these to all samples for which TprK deep sequencing is available. We found almost no overlap in TprK sequences between different patients. We further estimate that the total baseline junctional diversity of full-length TprK rivals that of current estimates of the human adaptive immune system. These data underscore the immunoevasive ability of TprK that allows T. pallidum to establish lifelong infection.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae emerged over the past decades as an important pathogen causing morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. For infection prevention and control, it is important to track the spread of bacterial strains in humans including the plasmids they contain. However, little is known concerning the plasmid repertoire among K. pneumoniae strains. Therefore, the major aim was to recapitulate the size, contents and diversity of the plasmids of genetically related K. pneumoniae strains harboring the beta-lactamase gene blaKPC-2 or blaKPC-3 to determine their dissemination in the Netherlands and the former Dutch Caribbean islands from 2014-2019. Next-generation sequencing was combined with long-read third-generation sequencing to reconstruct 18 plasmids of K. pneumoniae. wgMLST revealed five genetic clusters (termed KpnClusters) comprised of K. pneumoniae blaKPC-2 isolates and four clusters consisted of blaKPC-3 isolates. Each cluster was characterized by a distinct resistome and plasmidome. KpnCluster-019 blaKPC-2 isolates were found both in the Netherlands and the Caribbean islands. K. pneumoniae blaKPC-3 isolates were found in the collection of the Netherlands. The 18 plasmids were mostly unrelated and varied between K. pneumoniae blaKPC-2 and blaKPC-3 clusters. However, the large and medium sized plasmids contained a variety of antibiotic resistance genes, transposons, insertion sequence elements, conjugal transfer systems, cation transport systems, toxin/antitoxin systems, and prophage-related sequence elements. The small plasmids carried genes implicated in virulence. Thus, implementing long-read plasmid sequencing analysis for K. pneumoniae surveillance provided important insights in the success and understanding of transmission of a KpnCluster-019 blaKPC-2 strain between the Netherlands and the Caribbean.\n\nImportanceCarbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae has spread globally and is of great concern for debilitated patients. K. pneumoniae is notorious for spreading antimicrobial resistance genes by plasmids among Enterobacterales. Combining short and long read sequencing enables reconstruction of plasmids containing antibiotic resistance genes, conjugation machinery, transposons, toxins and/or virulence determinants and thereby enhancing international pathogen surveillance.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveMacrophages have been described in calcific aortic valve disease, but it is unclear if they promote or counteract calcification. We aimed to determine how macrophages are involved in calcification using the Notch1+/- model of calcific aortic valve disease.\n\nApproach and ResultsMacrophages in wild-type and Notch1+/- murine aortic valves were characterized by flow cytometry. Macrophages in Notch1+/- aortic valves had increased expression of MHCII. We then used bone marrow transplants to test if differences in Notch1+/- macrophages drive disease. Notch1+/- mice had increased valve thickness, macrophage infiltration, and M1-like macrophage polarization regardless of transplanted bone marrow genotype. In vitro approaches confirm that Notch1+/- aortic valve cells promote macrophage invasion as quantified by migration index and M1-like polarization quantified by Ly6C and CCR2 positivity regardless of macrophage genotype. Finally, we found that macrophage interaction with aortic valve cells promotes osteogenic, but not dystrophic, calcification by decreasing abundance of the STAT3{beta} isoform.\n\nConclusionsThis study reveals that Notch1+/- aortic valve disease involves increased macrophage recruitment and polarization driven by altered aortic valve cell secretion, and that increased macrophage recruitment promotes osteogenic calcification through STAT3 splicing changes. Further investigation of STAT3 and macrophage-driven inflammation as therapeutic targets in calcific aortic valve disease is warranted.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/919001v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3ee95org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@24ae93org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@41497corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f6c05_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

To achieve this promise of rtfMRI-nf, we introduced and demonstrated a data-driven framework to design a rtfMRI-nf intervention through the discovery of precise target location associated with clinical symptoms and neurofeedback signal optimization. Specifically, we identified the functional connectivity locus associated with rumination symptoms, utilizing a connectome-wide search in resting-state fMRI data from a large cohort of mood and anxiety disorder individuals (N=223) and healthy controls (N=45). Then, we performed a rtfMRI simulation analysis to optimize the online functional connectivity neurofeedback signal for the identified functional connectivity. The connectome-wide search was performed in the medial prefrontal cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus brain regions to identify the precise location of the functional connectivity associated with rumination severity as measured by the ruminative response style (RRS) scale. The analysis found that the functional connectivity between the loci in the precuneus (-6, -54, 48 mm in MNI) and the right temporo-parietal junction (RTPJ; 49, -49, 23 mm) was positively correlated with RRS scores (depressive, p < 0.001; brooding, p < 0.001; reflective, p = 0.002) in the mood and anxiety disorder group. We then performed a rtfMRI processing simulation to optimize the online computation of the precuneus-RTPJ connectivity. We determined that the two-point method without a control region was appropriate as a functional connectivity neurofeedback signal with less dependence on signal history and its accommodation of head motion. The present study offers a discovery framework for the precise location of functional connectivity targets for rtfMRI-nf intervention, which could help directly translate neuroimaging findings into clinical rtfMRI-nf interventions.",

    "abstract": "Cultural and geographical properties of the environment have been shown to deeply influence cognition and mental health[1-6]. While living near green spaces has been found to be strongly beneficial [7-11], urban residence has been associated with a higher risk of some psychiatric disorders [12-14] (although see [15]). However, how the environment one grew up in impacts later cognitive abilities remains poorly understood. Here, we used a cognitive task embedded in a video game[16] to measure non-verbal spatial navigation ability in 397,162 people from 38 countries across the world. Overall, we found that people who grew up outside cities are better at navigation. More specifically, people were better at navigating in environments topologically similar to where they grew up. Growing up in cities with low Street Network Entropy (e.g. Chicago) led to better results at video game levels with a regular layout, while growing up outside cities or in cities with higher Street Network Entropy (e.g. Prague) led to better results at more entropic video game levels. This evidences the impact of the environment on human cognition on a global scale, and highlights the importance of urban design on human cognition and brain function.",

    "abstract": "Marked-point process models have recently been used to capture the coding properties of neural populations from multi-unit electrophysiological recordings without spike sorting. These  clusterless models have been shown in some instances to better describe the firing properties of neural populations than collections of receptive field models for sorted neurons and to lead to better decoding results. To assess their quality, we previously proposed a goodness-of-fit technique for marked-point process models based on time-rescaling, which for a correct model, produces a set of uniform samples over a random region of space. However, assessing uniformity over such a region can be challenging, especially in high dimensions. Here, we propose a set of new transformations both in time and in the space of spike waveform features, which generate events that are uniformly distributed in the new mark and time spaces. These transformations are scalable to multi-dimensional mark spaces and provide uniformly distributed samples in hypercubes, which are well suited for uniformity tests. We discuss properties of these transformations and demonstrate aspects of model fit captured by each transformation. We also compare multiple uniformity tests to determine their power to identify lack-of-fit in the rescaled data. We demonstrate an application of these transformations and uniformity tests in a simulation study. Proofs for each transformation are provided in the Appendix section. We have made the MATLAB code used for the analyses in this paper publicly available through our Github repository at https://github.com/YousefiLab/Marked-PointProcess-Goodness-of-Fit",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo characterize the effects of netarsudil on the aqueous humor outflow tract distal to the trabecular meshwork (TM). We hypothesized that netarsudil increases outflow facility in eyes with and without circumferential ab interno trabeculectomy (AIT) that removes the TM.\n\nMethods64 porcine anterior segment cultures were randomly assigned to groups with (n=32) and without circumferential AIT (n=32). Cultures were exposed to 0.1, 1, and 10 M netarsudil (N= 8 eyes per concentration). For each concentration, IOP and vessel diameters were compared to their respective pretreatment baselines. Outflow tract vessel diameters were assessed by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) and rendered in 4D (XYZ time-series).\n\nResultsNetarsudil at 1 M reduced IOP in both eyes with TM (-0.60{+/-}0.24 mmHg, p = 0.01) and in eyes without TM (-1.79{+/-}0.42 mmHg, p<0.01). At this concentration, vessels of the distal outflow tract dilated by 72%. However, at 0.1 M netarsudil elevated IOP in eyes with TM (1.59{+/-}0.36 mmHg, p<0.001) as well as in eyes without TM (0.23{+/-}0.32 mmHg, p<0.001). Vessels of the distal outflow tract constricted by 31%. Similarly, netarsudil at a concentration of 10 M elevated IOP both in eyes with TM (1.91{+/-}0.193, p<0.001) and in eyes without TM (3.65{+/-}0.86 mmHg, p<0.001). At this concentration, outflow tract vessels constricted by 27%.\n\nConclusionIn the porcine anterior segment culture, the dose-dependent IOP changes caused by netarsudil matched the diameter changes of distal outflow tract vessels. Hyper- and hypotensive properties of netarsudil persisted after TM removal.",

    "abstract": "Freeze-thaw stress is one of the major environmental constraints that limit plant growth and reduces productivity and quality. Plants exhibit a variety of cellular dysfunction following freeze-thaw stress, including accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This means that enhancement of antioxidant capacity by exogenous application of antioxidants could potentially be one of major strategies for improving freezing tolerance (FT) of plants. Exogenous application of ascorbic acid (AsA), as an antioxidant, has been shown to improve plant tolerance against abiotic stresses but its effect on FT has not been investigated. We evaluated the effect of AsA-feeding on FT of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) at whole-plant and excised leaf level, and conducted metabolite profiling of leaves before and after AsA-treatment to explore metabolic explanation for change in FT. AsA-application did not impede leaf-growth; instead slightly promoted it. Temperature-controlled freeze-thaw tests revealed AsA-fed plants were more freezing tolerant as indicated by: 1) less visual damage/mortality; 2) lower ion-leakage; and 3) less oxidative-injury, lower abundance of free radicals (O2 *- and H2O2). Comparative leaf metabolic profiling revealed clear separation of metabolic phenotypes for control vs. AsA-fed leaves. Specifically, AsA-fed leaves had greater abundance of antioxidants (AsA, glutathione, alpha-& gamma-tocopherol) and compatible solutes (proline, galactinol, myo-inositol). AsA-fed leaves also had higher activity of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase). These changes, together, may improve FT via alleviating freeze-induced oxidative stress as well as protecting membranes from freeze-desiccation. Additionally, improved FT by AsA-feeding may potentially include enhanced cell wall/lignin augmentation and bolstered secondary metabolism as indicated by diminished level of phenylalanine and increased abundance of branched amino acids, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Individuals living in dense populations control their behaviors by sensing, integrating and responding to many cues. How can these processes enable the evolution and stability of cooperative behaviors that could easily be exploited by cheaters? Here we shed light on how bacteria regulate cooperation by studying swarming in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a behavior requiring cooperative secretions of rhamnolipid surfactants to facilitate collective movement over surfaces. By combining fluorescent imaging and computational analyses we show, counterintuitively, that rhamnolipid expression peaks at swarming edges. We then show that the integration of competing diffusive cues--quorum sensing signals and growth-limiting nutrients--enables P. aeruginosa to communicate across centimeters and adopt expression patterns unseen in well-mixed liquid culture. Integration of multiple cues enables robustness against cheating even when we experimentally perturb the quorum sensing system. Taken together, these results illuminate how the integration of cues in spatially structured communities can stabilize cooperation.",

    "abstract": "Dendrites of pyramidal neurons integrate different sensory inputs, and non-linear dendritic computations drive feature selective tuning and plasticity. Yet little is known about how dendrites themselves represent the environment, the degree to which they are coupled to their soma, and how that coupling is sculpted with experience. In order to answer these questions, we developed a novel preparation in which we image soma and connected dendrites in a single plane across days using in vivo two-photon microscopy. Using this preparation, we monitored spatially tuned activity in area CA3 of the hippocampus in head-fixed mice running on a linear track. We identified \"place dendrites\", which can stably and precisely represent both familiar and novel spatial environments. Dendrites could display place tuning independent of their connected soma and even their sister dendritic branches, the first evidence for branch-specific tuning in the hippocampus. In a familiar environment, spatially tuned somata were more decoupled from their dendrites as compared to non-tuned somata. This relationship was absent in a novel environment, suggesting an experience dependent selective gating of dendritic spatial inputs. We then built a data-driven multicompartment computational model that could capture the experimentally observed correlations. Our model predicts that place cells exhibiting branch-specific tuning have more flexible place fields, while neurons with homogenous or co-tuned dendritic branches have higher place field stability. These findings demonstrate that spatial representation is organized in a branch-specific manner within dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal cells. Further, spatial inputs from dendrites to soma are selectively and dynamically gated in an experience-dependent manner, endowing both flexibility and stability to the cognitive map of space.\n\nOne sentence summaryHippocampal pyramidal cells show branch-specific tuning for different place fields, and their coupling to their soma changes with experience of an environment.",

    "abstract": "Insect courtship and mating depend on integration of olfactory, visual, and tactile cues. Compared to other insects, Bombyx mori, the domesticated silkworm, has relatively simple sexual behaviors as it cannot fly. Here by using CRISPR/Cas and electrophysiological techniques we found that courtship and mating behaviors are regulated in male silk moths by mutating genes in the sex determination cascade belonging to two conserved pathways. Loss of Bmdsx gene expression significantly reduced the peripheral perception of the major pheromone component bombykol by reducing expression of the product of the BmOR1 gene which completely blocked courtship in adult males. Interestingly, we found that mating behavior was regulated independently by another sexual differentiation gene, Bmfru. Loss of Bmfru completely blocked mating, but males displayed normal courtship behavior. Lack of Bmfru expression significantly reduced the perception of the minor pheromone component bombykal due to the down regulation of BmOR3 expression; further, functional analysis revealed that loss of the product of BmOR3 played a key role in terminating male mating behavior. Our results suggest that Bmdsx and Bmfru are at the base of the two primary pathways that regulate olfactory-based sexual behavior.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe fundamental insect sexual behaviors, courtship and mating, result from successful integration of olfactory, vision, tactile and other complex innate behaviors. In the widely used insect model, Drosophila melanogaster, the sex determination cascade genes fruitless and doublesex are involved in the regulation of courtship and mating behaviors; however, little is known about the function of these sexual differentiation genes in regulating sex behaviors of Lepidoptera. Here we combine genetics and electrophysiology to investigate regulation pathway of sexual behaviors in the model lepidopteran insect, the domesticated silk moth, Bombyx mori. Our results support the presence of two genetic pathways in B. mori, named Bmdsx-BmOR1-bombykol and Bmfru-BmOR3-bombykal, which control distinct aspects of male sexual behavior that are modulated by olfaction. This is the first comprehensive report about the role of sex differentiation genes in the male sexual behavior in the silk moth.",

However, disease associated with BHV1 and BHV5 varies significantly; whereas BHV1 infection is usually associated with rhinotracheitis and abortion, BHV5 causes encephalitis in cattle. BHV5 outbreaks are sporadic and mainly restricted to the South American countries. We report BHV5 infection for the first time from aborted cattle in India. Based on the characteristic cytopathic effects in MDBK cells, amplification of the viral genome in PCR, differential PCR for BHV1/BHV5, nucleotide sequencing and restriction endonuclease patterns, identity of the virus was confirmed as BHV5 subtype A. Serum samples from the aborted cattle strongly neutralized both BHV1 and BHV5 suggesting an active viral infection in the herd. Upon UL27, UL44 and UL54 gene-based sequence and phylogenetic analysis, the isolated virus clustered with BHV5 strains and showed highest similarity with the Brazilian BHV5 strains.\n\nAuthor SummaryBHV5 causes fatal meningoencephalitis that may result in a mortality rate of up to 100% in cattle. BHV5 is rarely associated with abortion and its distribution is restricted to South American countries. Only a few cases of this disease have been reported from other countries. For the first time, we provide a strong evidence of BHV5 infection from aborted cattle in India. The finding may necessitate inclusion of BHV5 test protocol in testing of semen for sexually transmitted diseases. Also, the isolated virus would be useful for developing diagnostic, prophylactic and therapeutic agents to combat BHV5 disease in the country.",

We developed an index finger-based system (termed \"digital manometry\") and tested it in healthy volunteers, patients with chronic constipation, and fecal incontinence. Anorectal pressures were measured in 16 participants with the digital manometry system and a 23-channel high-resolution anorectal manometry system. The results were compared using a Bland-Altman analysis at rest as well as during maximum squeeze and simulated defecation maneuvers. Myoelectric activity of the puborectalis muscle was also quantified simultaneously using the digital manometry system. The limits of agreement between the two methods were -7.1 {+/-} 25.7 mmHg for anal sphincter resting pressure, 0.4 {+/-} 23.0 mmHg for the anal sphincter pressure change during simulated defecation, -37.6 {+/-} 50.9 mmHg for rectal pressure changes during simulated defecation, and -20.6 {+/-} 172.6 mmHg for anal sphincter pressure during the maximum squeeze maneuver. The change in the puborectalis myoelectric activity was proportional to the anal sphincter pressure increment during a maximum squeeze maneuver (slope = 0.6, R2 = 0.4). Digital manometry provided a similar evaluation of anorectal pressures and puborectalis myoelectric activity at an order of magnitude less cost than high-resolution manometry, and with a similar level of patient comfort. Digital Manometry provides a simple, inexpensive, point of service means of assessing anorectal function in patients with chronic constipation and fecal incontinence.",

    "abstract": "Accurate RNA quantification at the single-cell level is critical for understanding the dynamics of gene expression and regulation across space and time. Single molecule FISH (smFISH), such as RNAscope, provides spatial and quantitative measurements of individual transcripts, therefore, can be used to explore differential gene expression among a heterogeneous cell population if combined with cell identify information. However, such analysis is not straightforward, and existing image analysis pipelines cannot integrate both RNA transcripts and cellular staining information to automatically output cell type-specific gene expression. We developed an efficient and customizable analysis method, Single-Molecule Automatic RNA Transcription Quantification (SMART-Q), to enable the analysis of gene transcripts in a cell type-specific manner. SMART-Q efficiently infers cell identity information from multiplexed immuno-staining and quantifies cell type-specific transcripts using a 3D Gaussian fitting algorithm. Furthermore, we have optimized SMART-Q for user experiences, such as flexible parameters specification, batch data outputs, and visualization of analysis results. SMART-Q meets the demands for efficient quantification of single-molecule RNA and can be widely used for cell type-specific RNA transcript analysis.",

    "abstract": "The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing proteins (NOD) 1 and 2 are mammalian cytosolic pattern recognition receptors sensing bacterial peptidoglycan fragments in order to initiate cytokine expression and pathogen host defence. Since endothelial cells are relevant cells for pathogen recognition at the blood/tissue interface, we here analysed the role of NOD1- and NOD2-dependently expressed microRNAs (miRNAs, miR) for cytokine regulation in murine pulmonary endothelial cells. The induction of inflammatory cytokines in response to NOD1 and NOD2 was confirmed by increased expression of tumour necrosis factor (Tnf)- and interleukin (Il)-6. MiRNA expression profiling revealed NOD1- and NOD2-dependently regulated miRNA candidates, of which miR-147-3p, miR-200a-3p, and miR-298-5p were subsequently validated in pulmonary endothelial cells isolated from Nod1/2-deficient mice. In-silico analysis of the two down-regulated candidates miR-147-3p and miR-298-5p revealed predicted binding sites in the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of the murine Tnf- and Il-6 mRNA. Consequently, transfection of endothelial cells with miRNA mimics decreased Tnf- and Il-6 mRNA levels. Finally, a novel direct interaction of miR-298-5p with the 3UTR of the Il-6 mRNA was uncovered by luciferase reporter assays. We here identified a mechanism of miRNA-down-regulation by NOD stimulation thereby enabling the induction of inflammatory gene expression in endothelial cells.",

    "abstract": "The evidence for transgenerational transmission of pathologies in rodents exposed to pesticides is largely based on studies with weaknesses in design and analysis and a lack of transparency in reporting the results. This paper examines these methodological and statistical issues in detail. Its particular focus is on the estimation of  litter effects: the tendency for rodents within a litter to be more alike than rodents in different litters. Appropriate statistical models were fitted to published data from a series of widely reported studies carried out at Washington State University. These studies were amalgamated into a single dataset in order to estimate these litter effects and the associated treatment effects. Litter effects varied by outcome and were often substantial. Consequently, the effective sample size was often substantially less than the number of observations with implications for the power of the studies. Moreover, the reported precision of the estimates of treatment effects was too low. These problems are exacerbated by unexplained missing data across generations. Researchers in the life sciences could be more cognisant of the guidelines established in medicine for reporting randomised controlled trials, particularly cluster randomised trials. More attention should be paid to the design and analysis of multi-generational rodent studies; their imperfections have important implications for assessments of the evidence relating to the risks of pesticides for public health.",

    "abstract": "Similarly to other populations across the Americas, Argentinean populations trace back their genetic ancestry into African, European and Native American ancestors, reflecting a complex demographic history with multiple migration and admixture events in pre- and post-colonial times. However, little is known about the sub-continental origins of these three main ancestries. We present new high-throughput genotyping data for 87 admixed individuals across Argentina. This data was combined to previously published data for admixed individuals in the region and then compared to different reference panels specifically built to perform population structure analyses at a sub-continental level. Concerning the Native American ancestry, we could identify four Native American components segregating in modern Argentinean populations. Three of them are also found in modern South American populations and are specifically represented in Central Andes, Central Chile/Patagonia, and Subtropical and Tropical Forests geographic areas. The fourth component might be specific to the Central Western region of Argentina, and it is not well represented in any genomic data from the literature. As for the European and African ancestries, we confirmed previous results about origins from Southern Europe, Western and Central Western Africa, and we provide evidences for the presence of Northern European and Eastern African ancestries.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe human genetic diversity in Argentina reflects demographic processes during which the European colonists invaded a territory where Native American populations were settled. During the colonial period, the slave trade also prompted many African people to move to Argentina. Little is known about the origins of these three continental ancestry components in Argentinean populations nowadays. Genotyping data for 87 admixed individuals throughout Argentina was generated and data from the literature was re-analyzed to shed light on this question. We confirmed that most of the European genetic ancestry comes from the South, although several individuals are related to Northern Europeans. We confirmed that the African origins in Argentina mainly trace back from Western and Central/Western regions, and we document some proportion of Eastern African origins poorly described before. As for the Native American ancestry, we identified that it can be divided into four main components that correspond to Central Chile/Patagonia, Subtropical and Tropical Forests, Central Andes and Central Western region of Argentina. In order to understand the specificity of the genetic diversity in Argentina, more effort is required to generate specific massive genomic knowledge at the local level.",

    "abstract": "Plant cells undergo two types of cell cycles - the mitotic cycle in which DNA replication is coupled to mitosis, and the endocycle in which DNA replication occurs in the absence of cell division. To investigate DNA replication programs in these two types of cell cycles, we pulse labeled intact root tips of maize (Zea mays) with 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) and used flow sorting of nuclei to examine DNA replication timing (RT) during the transition from a mitotic cycle to an endocycle. Here, we compare sequence-based RT profiles and found that most regions of the maize genome replicate at the same time during S phase in mitotic and endocycling cells, despite the need to replicate twice as much DNA in the endocycle. However, regions collectively corresponding to 2% of the genome displayed significant changes in timing between the two types of cell cycles. The majority of these regions are small, with a median size of 135 kb, and shift to a later RT in the endocycle. However, we found larger regions that shifted RT in centromeres of seven of the ten maize chromosomes. These regions covered the majority of the previously defined functional centromere in each case, which are [~]1-2 Mb in size in the reference genome. They replicate mainly during mid S phase in mitotic cells, but primarily in late S phase of the endocycle. Strikingly, the immediately adjacent pericentromere sequences are primarily late replicating in both cell cycles. Analysis of CENH3 enrichment levels in nuclei of different ploidies suggested that there is only a partial replacement of CENH3 nucleosomes after endocycle replication is complete. The shift to later replication of centromeres and reduced CENH3 enrichment after endocycle replication is consistent with the hypothesis that centromeres are being inactivated as their function is no longer needed.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYIn traditional cell division, or mitosis, a cells genetic material is duplicated and then split between two daughter cells. In contrast, in some specialized cell types, the DNA is duplicated a second time without an intervening division step, resulting in cells that carry twice as much DNA - a phenomenon called an endocycle, which is common during plant development. At each step, DNA replication follows an ordered program, in which highly compacted DNA is unraveled and replicated in sections at different times during the synthesis (S) phase. In plants, it is unclear whether traditional and endocycle programs are the same. Using root tips of maize, we found a small portion of the genome whose replication in the endocycle is shifted in time, usually to later in S phase. Some of these regions are scattered around the genome, and mostly coincide with active genes. However, the most prominent shifts occur in centromeres. This location is noteworthy because centromeres orchestrate the process of separating duplicated chromosomes into daughter cells, a function that is not needed in the endocycle. Our observation that centromeres replicate later in the endocycle suggests there is an important link between the time of replication and the function of centromeres.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitors of bromodomain and extra-terminal motif proteins (\"BET inhibitors\") are emerging epigenetic therapeutics that exert their effects by suppressing the expression of genes that drive cancer and inflammation. The present study examined the anti-inflammatory effects of a quinazoline-based BET inhibitor, CN210, which also inhibits bromodomains of two paralogous histone acetyltransferases (HATs), such as cAMP-responsive element binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300. To assess its effectiveness against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), CN210 was tested in an experimentally-induced murine Crohns disease (CD)-like ileitis model. Ileitis was induced in mice by subcutaneous administration of indomethacin and CN210 was given orally 30 min before and 24 h after the indomethacin administration. Whilst indomethacin produced severe ileitis accompanied by an increase in ileal mucosal myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, administration of CN210 reduced the severity of ileitis in a dose-dependent manner and suppressed the MPO activity. Similarly, upregulation of inflammatory cytokines was observed in ileitis mucosa after indomethacin injection but this response was significantly attenuated by CN210 administration. To further characterize the effects of CN210 on inflammatory pathways, monocyte/macrophage-like cell line RAW264 treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was exposed to CN210. CN210 significantly attenuated the expression of inflammatory cytokines and reversed the activation of NF-{kappa}B and MAP kinases induced by LPS. These findings suggest that CN210 ameliorates indomethacin-induced ileitis due at least in part to the inhibition of inflammatory cytokine expression via attenuation of NF-{kappa}B and MAP kinase pathways, thus representing a new mode of therapy for CD.",

    "abstract": "Due to the severe consequences of climate change, associated risks to global food security, and the contribution of agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions, agriculture must necessarily adapt to meet these challenges. Many studies have therefore sought to investigate agricultural adaptation to climate change, and as key stakeholders in agriculture, farmers play a vital role in this process. There is a rapidly increasing corpus of scholarship on agricultural adaptation to climate change, with many studies beginning to incorporate survey methods to examine farmer perceptions and adaptation responses. Nevertheless, in-depth understanding of farmers worldwide is inadequate due to insufficiently robust methodologies, socio-economic disparities, and unequal geographic distribution. In this study, we searched and reviewed the existing peer-reviewed, English-language scientific articles published between 2008 and 2017 on agricultural adaptation to climate change that have incorporated farmers into their research methodologies. The main findings include the following: (1) a small but increasing number of studies focus on farmers in climate change adaptation; (2) the global geographic distribution of the reviewed studies is uneven, and many of the most vulnerable nations (e.g., lower-income/agricultural-dependent economies) have no representation at all; (3) there were diverse rationales and methods for incorporating farmers into the studies, and many of the methodological differences were due to practical and logistical limitations in lower-income/agricultural-dependent nations; and (4) studies were from multiple academic fields, indicating the need for more interdisciplinary collaboration moving forward because agricultural adaptation to climate change is too complex for a single discipline to fully explore. Although English is increasingly recognized as the \"international language of science,\" due to the challenge of language segmentation limiting broader understanding of global scholarship whenever possible, future reviews should be jointly conducted in both English and non-English languages.",

    "abstract": "Nutritional Programming (NP) has been studied as a means of mitigating the negative effects of dietary plant protein (PP), but the optimal timing and mechanism behind NP are still unknown. The objectives of this study were: 1) To determine whether zebrafish (Danio rerio) can be programmed to soybean meal (SBM) through early feeding and broodstock exposure to improve SBM utilization; 2) To determine if NP in zebrafish affects expression of genes associated with intestinal nutrient uptake; 3) To determine if early stage NP and/or broodstock affects gene expression associated with intestinal inflammation or any morphological changes in the intestinal tract that might improve dietary SBM utilization. Two broodstocks were used to form the six experimental groups. One broodstock group received fishmeal (FM) diet (FMBS), while the other was fed (\"programmed with\") SBM diet (PPBS). The first ((+) Control) and the second group ((-) Control) received FM and SBM diet for the entire study, respectively, and were progeny of FMBS. The last four groups consisted of a non-programmed (FMBS-X-PP and PPBS-X-PP) and a programmed group (FMBS-NP-PP and PPBS-NP-PP) from each of the broodstocks. The programming occurred through feeding with SBM diet during 13-23 dph. The non-control groups underwent a PP-Challenge, receiving SBM diet during 36-60 dph. During the PP-Challenge, both PPBS groups experienced significantly lower weight gains than the (+) Control group. NP in early life stages significantly increased the expression of PepT1 in PPBS-NP-PP, compared to PPBS-X-PP. NP also tended to increase the expression of fabp2 in the programmed vs. non-programmed groups of both broodstocks. The highest distal villus length-to-width ratio was observed in the dual-programmed group, suggesting an increase in surface area for nutrient absorption within the intestine. The results of this study suggest that NP during early life stages may increase intestinal absorption of nutrients from PP-based feeds.",

    "abstract": "Viruses subvert macromolecular pathways in infected host cells to aid in viral gene amplification or to counteract innate immune responses. Roles for host-encoded RNAs, including microRNAs, have been found to provide pro- and anti-viral functions. Recently, circular RNAs (circRNAs), that are generated by a nuclear back-splicing mechanism of pre-mRNAs, have been implicated to have roles in DNA virus-infected cells. This study examines the circular RNA landscape in uninfected and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected liver cells. Results showed that the abundances of distinct classes of circRNAs were up-regulated or down-regulated in infected cells. Identified circRNAs displayed pro-viral effects. One particular up-regulated circRNA, circPSD3, displayed a very pronounced effect on viral RNA abundances in both hepatitis C virus- and Dengue virus-infected cells. Surprisingly, circPSD3 also inhibited the cellular nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway in liver cells. Thus, enhanced abundance of circPSD3 in virus-infected cells aids in viral replication and likely contributes to the known inhibition of NMD in HCV-infected cells. Findings from the global analyses of the circular RNA landscape argue pro-, and likely, anti-viral functions are executed by circRNAs that modulate both viral gene expression as well as host pathways. Because of their long half-lives, circRNAs likely play hitherto unknown, important roles in viral pathogenesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryUsually, cells are infected by one or a few virus particles that carry genomes with limited expression capacity. Thus, the expression of viral genomes has to compete with a sea of cellular components that aid in viral translation, replication and virion production. Depending on their lifestyle, viruses have evolved to avoid or to subvert cellular pathways, especially those that display anti-viral functions. Host-derived circular RNA molecules have recently been discovered in the cytoplasm of cells, although, as-of yet, few functions have been assigned to them. Here, we describe alterations in the circular RNA landscape in hepatitis C virus-infected liver cells. Up-regulated and down-regulated circular RNAs were identified, and three of the upregulated RNAs were shown to promote HCV infection. One of them, circPSD3, inhibited the cellular nonsense-mediated RNA decay that is a powerful antiviral response in infected cells. Because circular RNAs are more stable than linear RNAs, they may have important functions during viral infection, dictating the outcomes of innate immune responses and viral pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "AP-1 proteins are members of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family of dimeric transcription factors, which facilitate a multitude of cellular processes, but are primarily known for their oncogenic potential in several cancer types. The oncogenic transcription factor AP-1 binds a specific DNA target site (5TCA[G/C]TGA), however the physical mechanism of how this is achieved has not been determined. The archetypal AP-1 complex is formed by cFos and cJun, which heterodimerize via their leucine zipper domains. We investigated the DNA-binding bZIP domains of AP-1 interacting with DNA tightropes using real-time single molecule fluorescence imaging in vitro. We find that AP-1 bZIP domains comprising cFos:cJun and cJun:cJun rapidly scan DNA using a 1D diffusional search with average diffusion constants of 0.14 m2s-1 and 0.26 m2s-1 respectively. We also report for the first time that cFos is able to bind to and diffuse on DNA (0.29 m2s-1) as a mixed population of monomers and homodimers, despite previous studies suggesting that it is incapable of independent DNA binding. Additionally, we note increased pause lifetimes for the cFos:cJun heterodimer compared to the cJun:cJun homodimer, and were able to detect distinct pausing behaviours within diffusion data. Understanding how cFos:cJun and other transcription factors identify their targets is highly relevant to the development of new therapeutics which target DNA binding proteins using these search mechanisms.",

Here we developed a tandem tension sensor (TTS) consisting of two coupled tension sensing units which are subject to the same tension and respond with different activation probabilities to the tension. Reported by fluorescence, the activation probability ratio of these two units solely responds to the force level of local integrin tensions, excluding the bias from other non-force factors. We verified the feasibility of TTS in detecting integrin tensions and applied it to study cells on elastic substrates. TTS unambiguously reported that integrin tensions in platelets decrease monotonically with the substrate rigidity, verifying the rigidity-dependence of integrin tensions in live cells.",

    "abstract": "Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a key role in maintaining body temperature as well as glucose and lipid homeostasis by its ability to dissipate energy through mitochondrial uncoupling. To facilitate these tasks BAT needs to adopt its thermogenic activity and substrate utilization to changes in nutrient availability, regulated by a complex network of neuronal, endocrine and nutritional inputs. Amongst this multitude of factors influencing BAT activity changes in the autophagic response of brown adipocytes are an important regulator of its thermogenic capacity and activity. Increasing evidence supports an important role of amino acid transporters in mTORC1 activation and the regulation of autophagy. However, a specific role of amino acid transporters in BAT regulating its function has not been described. Here we show that the brown adipocyte specific proton coupled amino acid transporter PAT2 rapidly translocates from the plasma membrane to the lysosome in response to amino acid withdrawal, where it facilitates the assembly of the lysosomal vATPase. Loss or overexpression of PAT2 therefore impair lysosomal acidification, autophagolysosome formation and starvation induced mTORC1 activation.",

    "abstract": "The ability of stem cells to switch between quiescence and proliferation is crucial for tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Drosophila quiescent neural stem cells (NSCs) extend a primary cellular protrusion from the cell body prior to their reactivation. However, the structure and function of this protrusion are not well established. In this study, we show that in the primary protrusion of quiescent NSCs microtubules are predominantly acentrosomal and oriented plus-end-out, distal to the cell body. We have identified Mini Spindles (Msps)/XMAP215 as a key regulator of NSC reactivation and acentrosomal microtubule assembly in quiescent NSCs. We show that E-cadherin, a cell adhesion molecule, is localized to NSC-neuropil contact points, in a Msps-dependent manner, and is intrinsically required for NSC reactivation. Our study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which Msps-dependent microtubule assembly in the primary protrusion of quiescent NSCs targets E-cadherin to NSC-neuropil contact sites to promote NSC reactivation. We propose that the neuropil functions as a new niche for promoting NSC reactivation, which may be a general paradigm in mammalian systems.",

    "abstract": "The ribosomal DNA (rDNA) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is in one tandem repeat array on Chromosome XII. Two spacer regions within each repetitive element, called non-transcribed spacer 1 (NTS1) and NTS2, are important in nucleolar organization. Smc5/6 localizes to both NTS1 and NTS2 and is involved in the regulation of Sir2 and Cohibin binding at NTS1, whereas Fob1 and Sir2 are required for optimal binding of the complex to NTS1 and NTS2, respectively. We demonstrate that Smc5/6 functions in chromatin silencing at NTS1 independently of its role in homologous recombination (HR) when forks pause at the replication fork barrier (RFB). In contrast, when the complex does not localize to the rDNA in nse3-1 mutants, the shortened lifespan correlates with NTS2 homeostasis independently of FOB1 status. Our data identify the importance of Smc5/6 integrity in NTS2 transcriptional silencing and repeat tethering, which in turn underscores rDNA stability and replicative lifespan.\n\nHighlightsO_LISmc5/6 is important for transcriptional silencing in the rDNA.\nC_LIO_LISmc5/6 tethers the rDNA array to the periphery.\nC_LIO_LITranscriptional silencing of ncRNA at NTS1 and NTS2 is differentially regulated.\nC_LIO_LISmc5/6 has a role in rDNA maintenance independent of HR processing at the RFB.\nC_LIO_LIFob1-independent disruption of Smc5/6 at NTS2 leads to lifespan reduction.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The Tof1-Csm3 fork protection complex has a central role in the replisome - it promotes the progression of DNA replication forks and protects them when they stall, while also enabling cohesion establishment and checkpoint responses. Here, I present the crystal structure of the Tof1-Csm3 complex from Chaetomium thermophilum at 3.1 [A] resolution. The structure reveals that Tof1 is an extended alpha-helical repeat protein which is capped at its C-terminal end by Csm3, a small helical bundle protein. I also characterize the DNA binding properties of the complex and a cancer-associated peptide-binding site. This study provides the molecular basis for understanding the functions of the Tof1-Csm3 complex, its human orthologue the Timeless-Tipin complex and additionally the Drosophila circadian rhythm protein Timeless.",

    "abstract": "Glycogen and starch are the major carbon and energy reserve polysaccharides in nature, providing living organisms with a survival advantage. The evolution of the enzymatic machinery responsible for the biosynthesis and degradation of such polysaccharides, led the development of mechanisms to control the assembly and disassembly rate, to store and recover glucose according to cell energy demands. The tetrameric enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) catalyzes and regulates the initial step in the biosynthesis of both -polyglucans. Importantly, AGPase displays cooperativity and allosteric regulation by sensing metabolites from the cell energy flux. The understanding of the allosteric signal transduction mechanisms in AGPase arises as a long-standing challenge. In this work, we disclose the cryoEM structures of the paradigmatic homotetrameric AGPase from Escherichia coli (EcAGPase), in complex with either positive or negative physiological allosteric regulators, FBP and AMP respectively, both at 3.0 [A] resolution. Strikingly, the structures reveal that FBP binds deeply into the allosteric cleft and overlaps the AMP site. As a consequence, FBP promotes a concerted conformational switch of a regulatory loop, RL2, from a  locked to a  free state, modulating ATP binding and activating the enzyme. This notion is strongly supported by our complementary biophysical and bioinformatics evidence, and a careful analysis of vast enzyme kinetics data on single-point mutants of EcAGPase. The cryoEM structures uncover the residue interaction networks (RIN) between the allosteric and the catalytic components of the enzyme, providing unique details on how the signaling information is transmitted across the tetramer, from which cooperativity emerges. Altogether, the conformational states visualized by cryoEM reveal the regulatory mechanism of EcAGPase, laying the foundations to understand the allosteric control of bacterial glycogen biosynthesis at the molecular level of detail.",

    "abstract": "Polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) have been observed in epithelial ovarian tumors and have the ability to survive to antimitotic drugs. Their appearance can result from paclitaxel treatment or hypoxia, two conditions known to induce unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. PGCCs produced under hypoxia may be formed by cell fusion and can contribute by bursting and budding to the generation of cancer stem-like cells which have a more aggressive phenotype than the parental cells. Despite the fact that PGCCs may contribute to tumor maintenance and recurrence, they were poorly studied. Here, we confirmed that PGCCs could derive, at least in part, from cell fusion. We also observed that PGCCs nuclei were able to fuse. The resulting cells were able to proliferate by mitosis and were more invasive than the parental cancer cells. Using two different ovarian cancer cell lines (COV318 and SKOV3), we showed that UPR activation with chemical inducers increased cell fusion and PGCCs appearance. Down-regulation of the UPR-associated protein PERK expression partially reversed the UPR-induced PGCCs formation, suggesting that the PERK arm of the UPR is involved in ovarian PGCCs onset.",
