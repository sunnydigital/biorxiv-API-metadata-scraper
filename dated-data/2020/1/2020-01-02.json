    "abstract": "Auxin is a crucial plant growth regulator. Forward genetic screens for auxin-related mutants have led to the identification of key genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, transport, and signaling. Loss-of-function mutations in the genes involved in indole glucosinolate biosynthesis, a metabolically-related route that produces defense compounds from indolic precursors shared with the auxin pathway, result in auxin overproduction. We identified an allelic series of fertile, hypomorphic mutants for an essential indole glucosinolate route gene ROOTY (RTY) that show a range of high-auxin defects. Genetic characterization of these lines uncovered phenotypic suppression by cyp79b2 b3, wei2, and wei7 mutants and revealed the phenomenon of interallelic complementation in several RTY transheterozygotes. Structural modeling of RTY shed light on the structure-to-function relations in the RTY homo- and heterodimers and unveiled the likely structural basis of interallelic complementation. This work underscores the importance of employing true null mutants in genetic complementation studies.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin 22 (IL-22) is an epithelial survival cytokine that is at present being explored as therapeutic agents for acute and chronic liver injury. However, its molecular basis of protective activities remains poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that IL-22 inhibits the deteriorating metabolic states induced by stimuli in hepatocytes. Specifically, we provide evidence that IL-22 promotes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis and regulates the metabolic reprogramming related transcriptional responses. IL-22 controls metabolic regulators and enzymes activity through the induction of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), thereby ameliorating mitochondrial. The upstream effector lncRNA H19 also participates in the controlling of these metabolic processes in hepatocytes. Importantly, amelioration of liver injury by IL-22 through activation of metabolism relevant signaling and regulation of mitochondrial function are further demonstrated in cisplatin-induced liver injury and steatohepatitis. Collectively, our results reveal a novel mechanism underscoring the regulation of metabolic profiles of hepatocytes by IL-22 during liver injury, which might provide useful insights from the bench to the clinic in treating and preventing liver diseases.\n\nGraphical AbstractOur works demonstrate a critical role of IL-22 in regulating hepatocellular metabolism to treat liver injury via activating STAT3-lncRNA H19-AMPK-AKT-mTOR axis. These findings describe a novel mechanism underscoring the regulation of metabolic states of hepatocytes by IL-22 during liver injury with potentially broad therapeutic insights.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=194 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/892927v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c6308corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19d6e17org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a6e661org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15f129e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Estimating invasion dynamic is important to the management of invasive species, and geopolitical-unit level data are usually the most abundant and available records of invasive species. Here, for the first time we evaluated performances and similarities of eight common methods to estimate spread pattern and spread dynamic of invasive species with geopolitical-unit level data, and assessed impacts of variations in geopolitical-units on each method using simulated spread data. We also formulated a concave hull boundary displacement method (i.e., CEB) and an area-based regression method (i.e., AER) for estimating spread with geopolitical-unit data. Three regions with different sized counties in the United States (U.S.) were selected to conduct simulations and three spread scenarios were simulated. R2 and root mean square error were used to evaluate the abilities of all methods to estimate spread. Correlation coefficients were used to assess the similarity pattern of all methods. Finally, kudzu bug Megacopta cribraria, an invasive insect in the U.S., was used as a case study to test the generality of some results concluded from the simulated research. We found the CEB and two regression methods consistently estimated the right expansion patterns. Two boundary displacement and two area-based regression methods estimated highly correlated spread and were the best four methods, among which CEB had the best estimation. Distance-based regression methods are sensitive to irregularity and stochasticity in spread, and the minimum spread distance method had low ability to estimate spread. The case study showed consistent results with the simulated research. Both regression and boundary displacement methods can estimate spread patterns, overall rate, and spread dynamics of invasive species. Boundary displacement methods best estimate spread rates and dynamics; however, for spread without clear infestation outlines, area-based regression methods can be good alternatives.",

    "abstract": "The wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides; WEW) yellow (stripe) rust resistance genes Yr15, YrG303 and YrH52 were discovered in natural populations from different geographic locations. They all localize to chromosome 1B but were thought to be non-allelic based on differences in resistance response. We recently cloned Yr15 as a Wheat Tandem Kinase 1 (WTK1) and showed here that these three resistance loci co-segregate in fine-mapping populations and share identical full-length genomic sequence of functional Wtk1. Independent EMS mutagenized susceptible yrG303 and yrH52 lines carried single nucleotide mutations in Wtk1 that disrupted function. A comparison of the mutations for yr15, yrG303 and yrH52 mutants showed that while key conserved residues were intact, other conserved regions in critical kinase subdomains were frequently affected. Thus, we concluded that Yr15-, YrG303- and YrH52-mediated resistances to yellow rust are encoded by a single locus Wtk1. Introgression of Wtk1 into multiple genetic backgrounds resulted in variable phenotypic responses, confirming that Wtk1-mediated resistance is part of a complex immune response network. WEW natural populations subjected to natural selection and adaptation have potential to serve as a good source for evolutionary studies of different traits and multifaceted gene networks.\n\nHighlightWe demonstrate that Yr15, YrG303 and YrH52 resistances are encoded by the Wtk1 locus, but express variable resistance responses to yellow rust in a genetic background dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural water is an important source of foodborne pathogens on produce farms. Managing water-associated risks does not lend itself to one-size-fits-all approaches due to the heterogeneous nature of freshwater environments, and because environmental conditions affect the likelihood of pathogen contamination and the relationship between indicator organism levels (e.g., E. coli) and pathogen presence. To improve our ability to develop location-specific risk management practices, a study was conducted in two produce-growing regions to (i) characterize the relationship between E. coli levels and pathogen presence in agricultural water, and (ii) identify environmental factors associated with pathogen detection. Three AZ and six NY waterways were sampled longitudinally using 10-L grab samples (GS) and 24-h Moore swabs (MS). Regression showed that the likelihood of Salmonella detection (Odds Ratio [OR]=2.18), and eaeA-stx codetection (OR=6.49) was significantly greater for MS compared to GS, while the likelihood of detecting L. monocytogenes was not. Regression also showed that eaeA-stx codetection in AZ (OR=50.2) and NY (OR=18.4), and Salmonella detection in AZ (OR=4.4) were significantly associated with E. coli levels, while Salmonella detection in NY was not. Random forest analysis indicated that interactions between environmental factors (e.g., rainfall, temperature, turbidity) (i) were associated with likelihood of pathogen detection and (ii) mediated the relationship between E. coli levels and likelihood of pathogen detection. Our findings suggest that (i) environmental heterogeneity, including interactions between factors, affects microbial water quality, and (ii) E. coli levels alone may not be a suitable indicator of the food safety risks. Instead, targeted methods that utilize environmental and microbial data (e.g., models that use turbidity and E. coli levels to predict when there is a high or low risk of surface water being contaminated by pathogens) are needed to assess and mitigate the food safety risks associated with preharvest water use. By identifying environmental factors associated with an increased likelihood of detecting pathogens in agricultural water, this study provides information that (i) can be used to assess when pathogen contamination of agricultural water is likely to occur, and (ii) facilitate development of targeted interventions for individual water sources, providing an alternative to existing one-size-fits-all approaches.",

Exploration of spatially unstructured options depends on the neocortex, striatum, and amygdala. In natural environments, however, better options often cluster together, forming structured value distributions. The hippocampus binds reward information into allocentric cognitive maps to support navigation and foraging in such spaces. Using a reinforcement learning task with a spatially structured reward function, we show that human posterior hippocampus (PH) invigorates exploration while anterior hippocampus (AH) supports the transition to exploitation. These dynamics depend on differential reinforcement representations in the PH and AH. Whereas local reward prediction error signals are early and phasic in the PH tail, global value maximum signals are delayed and sustained in the AH body. AH compresses reinforcement information across episodes, updating the location and prominence of the value maximum and displaying goal cell-like ramping activity when navigating toward it.",

Monogenic models allow an opportunity to understand its mechanisms, in particular because the migraine aura is associated with spreading depolarizations that can be measured physiologically. Using fluorescent glutamate imaging in awake mice carrying a familial hemiplegic migraine type 2 mutation, we recorded previously undescribed spontaneous  plumes of glutamate signaling that anatomically overlapped with reduced density of GLT-1a positive astrocyte processes. These events could be mimicked in wild-type animals by inhibition of glutamate clearance, which we show to be slower during sensory processing in FHM2 carriers. Plumes depended on calcium mediated vesicular release from neurons, but not action potentials. Importantly, a rise in both basal glutamate and plume frequency predicted the onset of spreading depolarization in WT and FHM2 animals, providing a novel mechanism in migraine with aura and by extension the many other neurological disorders where spreading depolarizations occur.",

    "abstract": "Speech and music are highly redundant communication systems, with multiple acoustic cues signaling the existence of perceptual categories. This redundancy makes these systems robust to the influence of noise, but necessitates the development of perceptual strategies: listeners need to decide the importance to place on each source of information. Prior empirical work and modeling has suggested that cue weights primarily reflect within-task statistical learning, as listeners assess the reliability with which different acoustic dimensions signal a category and modify their weights accordingly. Here we present evidence that perceptual experience can lead to changes in cue weighting which extend across tasks and across domains, suggesting that perceptual strategies reflect both global biases and local (i.e. task-specific) learning. In two experiments, native speakers of Mandarin (N=45)--where pitch is a crucial cue to word identity--placed more importance on pitch and less importance on other dimensions compared to native speakers of non-tonal languages English (N=45) and Spanish (N=27), during the perception of both second language speech and musical beats. In a third experiment, we further show that Mandarin speakers are better able to attend to pitch and ignore irrelevant variation in other dimensions compared to English and Spanish speakers, and even struggle to ignore pitch when asked to attend to other dimensions. Thus, an individuals idiosyncratic auditory perceptual strategies reflect a complex mixture of congenital predispositions, task-specific learning, and biases instilled by extensive experience in making use of important dimensions in their native language.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence calcium imaging using a range of microscopy approaches, such as 2-photon excitation or head-mounted  miniscopes, is one of the preferred methods to record neuronal activity and glial signals in various experimental settings, including acute brain slices, brain organoids, and behaving animals. Because changes in the fluorescence intensity of genetically encoded or chemical calcium indicators correlate with action potential firing in neurons, data analysis is based on inferring such spiking from changes in pixel intensity values across time within different regions of interest. However, the algorithms necessary to extract biologically relevant information from these fluorescent signals are complex and require significant expertise in programming to develop robust analysis pipelines. For decades, the only way to perform these analyses was for individual laboratories to write their own custom code. These routines were typically not well annotated and lacked intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs), which made it difficult for scientists in other laboratories to adopt them. Although the panorama is changing with recent tools like CaImAn, Suite2P and others, there is still a barrier for many laboratories to adopt these packages, especially for potential users without sophisticated programming skills. As 2-photon microscopes are becoming increasingly affordable, the bottleneck is no longer the hardware, but the software used to analyze the calcium data in an optimal manner and consistently across different groups. We addressed this unmet need by incorporating recent software solutions for motion correction, segmentation, signal extraction and deconvolution of calcium imaging data into an open-source, easy to use, GUI-based, intuitive and automated data analysis software, which we named EZcalcium.",

    "abstract": "AimsAssessment of preclinical models of vascular disease are paramount in the successful translation of novel treatments. The results of these models have traditionally relied on 2-D histological methodologies. Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) is an imaging platform that allows for 3-D visualization of whole organs and tissues. In this study, we describe an improved methodological approach utilizing LSFM for imaging of preclinical vascular injury models while minimizing analysis bias.\n\nMethods and ResultsThe rat carotid artery segmental pressure-controlled balloon injury and mouse carotid artery ligation injury were performed. Arteries were harvested and processed for LSFM imaging and 3-D analysis, as well as for 2-D area histological analysis. Artery processing for LSFM imaging did not induce vessel shrinkage or expansion, and was reversible by rehydrating the artery, allowing for subsequent sectioning and histological staining a posteriori. By generating a volumetric visualization along the length of the arteries, LSFM imaging provided different analysis modalities including volumetric, area, and radial parameters. Thus, LSFM-imaged arteries provided more precise measurements compared to classic histological analysis. Furthermore, LSFM provided additional information as compared to 2-D analysis in demonstrating remodeling of the arterial media in regions of hyperplasia and periadventitial neovascularization around the ligated mouse artery.\n\nConclusionsLSFM provides a novel and robust 3-D imaging platform for visualizing and quantifying arterial injury in preclinical models. When compared with classic histology, LSFM outperformed traditional methods in precision and quantitative capabilities. LSFM allows for more comprehensive quantitation as compared to traditional histological methodologies, while minimizing user bias associated with area analysis of alternating, 2-D histological artery cross-sections.\n\nTranslational PerspectiveA more reproducible and robust quantitation of vascular pathology in preclinical models is necessary to accelerate translational discovery. Current methodology to assess vascular disease has significant limitations. The methodology described herein employs a modern imaging modality, light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), to improve assessment of established preclinical vascular injury models. LSFM provides more comprehensive and precise analysis capabilities than classical histological approaches. Hence, LSFM applied to vascular research has the potential to drive new basic discoveries, and ultimately translation of novel therapies.",

    "abstract": "Viral macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (vMIP-II/vCCL2) binds to multiple chemokine receptors, and vMIP-II based PET tracer (64Cu-DOTA-vMIP-II: vMIP-II tracer) accumulates at atherosclerotic lesions in mice. The magnitude of 64Cu-DOTA-vMIP-II accumulation correlated with monocyte recruitment, as Apoe-/- mice treated with AAV-mApoE showed PET signal declining as monocyte recruitment subsided. Unexpectedly, monocytes themselves were not the major target of the 64Cu-DOTA-vMIP-II tracer. Using fluorescence-tagged vMIP-II tracer, competitive receptor blocking with CXCR4 antagonists, CXCR4-specific tracer 64Cu-DOTA-FC131, or CXCR4 staining during disease progression and regression, endothelial cell expression of CXCR4 proved to be the main target of 64Cu-DOTA-vMIP-II imaging. Expression of CXCR4 was low in non-plaque areas, but strongly detected on endothelium at the edges of progressing plaques, corresponding to a population of proliferating endothelium and to the location in plaques where monocyte recruitment occurred. Thus, endothelial injury status of plaques is marked by CXCR4 expression and that this injury correlates with the tendency of such plaques to recruit monocytes. Furthermore, our findings suggest PET tracers that, through binding CXCR4, may be useful to monitor plaque injury status.",

    "abstract": "Stress signaling in plants is carefully regulated to ensure proper development and reproductive fitness. Overactive defense signaling can result in dwarfism as well as developmental defects. In addition to requiring a significant amount of energy, plant stress responses place a burden upon the cellular machinery, which can result in the accumulation of misfolded proteins and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Negative regulators of stress signaling, such as EDR1, ensure that stress responses are properly suspended when they are not needed. Here, we describe the role of an uncharacterized N-terminal acetyltransferase, NAA50, in the regulation of plant development and stress responses. Our results demonstrate that NAA50, an interactor of EDR1, plays an important role in regulating the tradeoff between plant growth and defense. Plants lacking NAA50 display severe developmental defects as well as induced stress responses. Reduction of NAA50 expression results in arrested stem and root growth and senescence. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that EDR1 and NAA50 are required for suppression of ER stress signaling. This work establishes that NAA50 is essential for plant development and the suppression of stress responses, likely through the regulation of ER stress. These experiments demonstrate a role for N-terminal acetylation in the suppression of ER stress, as well as the tradeoff between stress responses and development.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryKnockout in Arabidopsis of the broadly conserved N-terminal acetyl transferase NAA50 induces ER stress, leading to severe dwarfism and induction of defense responses.",

    "abstract": "Exogenous miRNAs enter the human body through food, and their effects on metabolic processes can be considerable. It is important to determine which miRNAs from plants affect the expression of human genes and the extent of their influence. The binding sites of 738 osa-miRNAs that interact with 17508 mRNAs of human genes were determined using the MirTarget program. The characteristics of the binding of 46 single osa-miRNAs to 86 mRNAs of human genes with a value of free energy ({Delta}G) interaction equal 94% to 100% from maximum {Delta}G were established. The findings showed that osa-miR2102-5p, osa-miR5075-3p, osa-miR2097-5p, osa-miR2919 targeted the largest number of genes at 38, 36, 23, 19 sites, respectively. mRNAs of 86 human genes were identified as targets for 93 osa-miRNAs of all family osa-miRNAs with {Delta}G values equal 94% to 98% from maximum {Delta}G. Each miRNA of the osa-miR156-5p, osa-miR164-5p, osa-miR168-5p, osa-miR395-3p, osa-miR396-3p, osa-miR396-5p, osa-miR444-3p, osa-miR529-3p, osa-miR1846-3p, osa-miR2907-3p families had binding sites in mRNAs of several human target genes. The binding sites of osa-miRNAs in mRNAs of the target genes for each family of osa-miRNAs were conserved when compared to flanking nucleotide sequences. mRNA human genes of osa-miRNAs are candidate genes of cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "CD4+ T cells provide adaptive immunity against pathogens and abnormal cells, and they are also associated with various immune related diseases. CD4+ T cells metabolism is dysregulated in these pathologies and represents an opportunity for drug discovery and development. Genome-scale metabolic modeling offers an opportunity to accelerate drug discovery by providing high-quality information about possible target space in the context of a modeled disease. Here, we develop genome-scale models of naive, Th1, Th2 and Th17 CD4+ T cell subtypes to map metabolic perturbations in rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and primary biliary cholangitis. We subjected these models to in silico simulations for drug response analysis of existing FDA-approved drugs, and compounds. Integration of disease-specific differentially expressed genes with altered reactions in response to metabolic perturbations identified 68 drug targets for the three autoimmune diseases. In vitro experimental validations together with literature-based evidence showed that modulation of fifty percent of identified drug targets has been observed to lead to suppression of CD4+ T cells, further increasing their potential impact as therapeutic interventions. The used approach can be generalized in the context of other diseases, and novel metabolic models can be further used to dissect CD4+ T cell metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, the spotted wing Drosophila, Drosophila suzukii, has invaded Europe and America and has become a major agricultural pest in these areas, thereby prompting intense research activities to better understand its biology. Two draft genome assemblies based on short-read sequencing were released in 2013 for this species. Although valuable, these resources contain pervasive assembly errors and are highly fragmented, two features limiting their values. Our purpose here was to improve the assembly of the D. suzukii genome. For this, we generated PacBio long-read sequencing data at 160X sequence coverage and assembled a novel, contiguous D. suzukii genome. We obtained a high-quality assembly of 270 Mb (with 546 contigs, a N50 of 2.6Mb, a L50 of 15, and a BUSCO score of 95%) that we called WT3-2.0. We found that despite 16 rounds of full-sib crossings the D. suzukii strain that we sequenced has maintained high levels of polymorphism in some regions of its genome (ca. 19Mb). As a consequence, the quality of the assembly of these regions was reduced. We explored possible origins of this high residual diversity, including the presence of structural variants and a possible heterogeneous admixture pattern of North American and Asian ancestry. Overall, our WT3-2.0 assembly provides a higher quality genomic resource compared to the previous one in terms of general assembly statistics, sequence quality and gene annotation. This new D. suzukii genome assembly is therefore an improved resource for high-throughput sequencing approaches, as well as manipulative genetic technologies to study D. suzukii.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic profiling by ChIP-Seq has become a powerful tool for genome-wide identification of regulatory elements, for defining transcriptional regulatory networks and for screening for biomarkers. However, the ChIP-Seq protocol for low-input samples is laborious, time-consuming and suffers from experimental variation, resulting in poor reproducibility and low throughput. Although prototypic microfluidic ChIP-Seq platforms have been developed, these are poorly transferable as they require sophisticated custom-made equipment and in-depth microfluidic and ChIP expertise, while lacking parallelisation. To enable standardized, automated ChIP-Seq profiling of low-input samples, we constructed PDMS-based plates containing microfluidic Integrated Fluidic Circuits capable of performing 24 sensitive ChIP reactions within 30 minutes hands-on time. These disposable plates can conveniently be loaded into a widely available controller for pneumatics and thermocycling, making the ChIP-Seq procedure Plug and Play (PnP). We demonstrate high-quality ChIP-seq on hundreds to few thousands of cells for multiple widely-profiled post-translational histone modifications, together allowing genome-wide identification of regulatory elements. As proof of principle, we managed to generate high-quality epigenetic profiles of rare totipotent subpopulations of mESCs using our platform. In light of the ready-to-go ChIP plates and the automated workflow, we named our procedure PnP-ChIP-Seq. PnP-ChIP-Seq allows non-expert labs worldwide to conveniently run robust, standardized ChIP-Seq, while its high-throughput, consistency and sensitivity paves the way towards large-scale profiling of precious sample types such as rare subpopulations of cells or biopsies.\n\nReviewer link to dataAll sequencing data has been submitted to the NCBI GEO database.
