    "abstract": "Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1 infection is life-long. Stopping therapy typically leads to the reignition of infection and progressive disease. In a major breakthrough, recent studies have shown that early initiation of ART can lead to sustained post-treatment control of viremia, raising hopes of long-term HIV-1 remission. ART, however, elicits post-treatment control in a small fraction of individuals treated. Strikingly, passive immunization with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of HIV-1 early in infection was found recently to elicit long-term control in a majority of SHIV-infected macaques, suggesting that HIV-1 remission may be more widely achievable. The mechanisms underlying the control elicited by bNAb therapy, however, remain unclear. Untreated infection typically leads to progressive disease. We hypothesized that viremic control represents an alternative but rarely realized outcome of the infection and that early bNAb therapy triggers a dynamical switch to this outcome. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a model of viral dynamics with bNAb therapy and applied it to analyse clinical data. The model fit quantitatively the complex longitudinal viral load data from macaques that achieved lasting control. The model predicted, consistently with our hypothesis, that the underlying system exhibited bistability, indicating two potential outcomes of infection. The first had high viremia, weak cytotoxic effector responses, and high effector exhaustion, marking progressive disease. The second had low viremia, strong effector responses, and low effector exhaustion, indicating lasting viremic control. Further, model predictions suggest that early bNAb therapy elicited lasting control via pleiotropic effects. bNAb therapy lowers viremia, which would also limit immune exhaustion. Simultaneously, it can improve effector stimulation via cross-presentation. Consequently, viremia may resurge post-therapy, but would encounter a primed effector population and eventually get controlled. ART suppresses viremia but does not enhance effector stimulation, explaining its limited ability to elicit post-treatment control relative to bNAb therapy.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn a remarkable advance in HIV cure research, a recent study showed that 3 weekly doses of HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) soon after infection kept viral levels controlled for years in most macaques treated. If translated to humans, this bNAb therapy may elicit a functional cure, or long-term remission, of HIV-1 infection, eliminating the need for life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART). How early bNAb therapy works remains unknown. Here, we elucidate the mechanism using mathematical modeling and analysis of in vivo data. We predict that early bNAb therapy suppresses viremia, which reduces exhaustion of cytotoxic effector cells, and enhances antigen uptake and effector stimulation. Collectively, these effects drive infection to lasting control. Model predictions based on these effects fit in vivo data quantitatively. ART controls viremia but does not improve effector stimulation, explaining its weaker ability to induce lasting control post-treatment. Our findings may help improve strategies for achieving functional cure of HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of translation elongation plays a crucial role in determining absolute protein levels and ensuring the correct localization and folding of proteins. Much of our knowledge regarding translation elongation comes from the sequencing of mRNA fragments protected by single ribosomes (ribo-seq). However, larger protected mRNA fragments have been observed, suggesting the existence of an alternative and previously hidden layer of regulation. In this study, we performed disome-seq to sequence mRNA fragments protected by two stacked ribosomes -- a product of translational pauses during which the 5'-ribosome collides with the 3'-paused one. We detected widespread ribosome collisions that are missed in traditional ribo-seq. These collisions are due to 1) slow ribosome release when stop codons are at the A-site, 2) slow peptide bond formation from proline, glycine, asparagine, and cysteine when they are at the P-site, and 3) slow leaving of polylysine from the exit tunnel of ribosomes. The paused ribosomes can continue translating after collisions, as suggested by the structure of disomes obtained by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Collided ribosomes recruit chaperones, which can aid in the co-translational folding of the nascent peptides. Therefore, cells use regulated ribosome collisions to ensure protein homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The occasional reversal of sex-typical behavior suggests that many of the neural circuits underlying behavior are conserved between males and females and can be activated in response to the appropriate social condition or stimulus. Most poison frog species (Family Dendrobatidae) exhibit male uniparental care, but flexible compensation has been observed in some species, where females will take over parental care duties when males disappear. We investigated hormonal and neural correlates of sex-typical and sex-reversed parental care in a typically male uniparental species, the Dyeing Poison Frog (Dendrobates tinctorius). We first characterized hormone levels and whole brain gene expression across parental care stages during sex-typical care. Surprisingly, hormonal changes and brain gene expression differences associated with active parental behavior in males were mirrored in their non-caregiving female partners. To further explore the disconnect between neuroendocrine patterns and behavior, we characterized hormone levels and neural activity patterns in females performing sex-reversed parental care. In contrast to hormone and gene expression patterns, we found that patterns of neural activity were linked to the active performance of parental behavior, with sex-reversed tadpole transporting females exhibiting neural activity patterns more similar to those of transporting males than non-caregiving females. We suggest that parallels in hormones and brain gene expression in active and observing parents are related to females ability to flexibly take over parental care in the absence of their male partners.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=131 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/765503v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (50K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18f4b87org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a7b6ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@da7394org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1da19c8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Replicability, the ability to replicate scientific findings, is a prerequisite for scientific discovery and clinical utility. Troublingly, we are in the midst of a replicability crisis. A key to replicability is that multiple measurements of the same item (e.g., experimental sample or clinical participant) under fixed experimental constraints are relatively similar to one another. Thus, statistics that quantify the relative contributions of accidental deviations--such as measurement error--as compared to systematic deviations--such as individual differences--are critical. We demonstrate that existing replicability statistics, such as intra-class correlation coefficient and fingerprinting, fail to adequately differentiate between accidental and systematic deviations in very simple settings. We therefore propose a novel statistic, discriminability, which quantifies the degree to which an individuals samples are relatively similar to one another, without restricting the data to be univariate, Gaussian, or even Euclidean. Using this statistic, we introduce the possibility of optimizing experimental design via increasing discriminability and prove that optimizing discriminability improves performance bounds in subsequent inference tasks. In extensive simulated and real datasets (focusing on brain imaging and demonstrating on genomics), only optimizing data discriminability improves performance on all subsequent inference tasks for each dataset. We therefore suggest that designing experiments and analyses to optimize discriminability may be a crucial step in solving the replicability crisis, and more generally, mitigating accidental measurement error.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn recent decades, the size and complexity of data has grown exponentially. Unfortunately, the increased scale of modern datasets brings many new challenges. At present, we are in the midst of a replicability crisis, in which scientific discoveries fail to replicate to new datasets. Difficulties in the measurement procedure and measurement processing pipelines coupled with the influx of complex high-resolution measurements, we believe, are at the core of the replicability crisis. If measurements themselves are not replicable, what hope can we have that we will be able to use the measurements for replicable scientific findings? We introduce the \"discriminability\" statistic, which quantifies how discriminable measurements are from one another, without limitations on the structure of the underlying measurements. We prove that discriminable strategies tend to be strategies which provide better accuracy on downstream scientific questions. We demonstrate the utility of discriminability over competing approaches in this context on two disparate datasets from both neuroimaging and genomics. Together, we believe these results suggest the value of designing experimental protocols and analysis procedures which optimize the discriminability.",

    "abstract": "Brain imaging can be used to study how individuals brains are aging, compared against population norms. This can inform on aspects of brain health; for example, smoking and blood pressure can be seen to accelerate brain aging. Typically, a single \"brain age\" is estimated per subject, whereas here we we identified 62 modes of subject variability, from 21,407 subjects multimodal brain imaging data in UK Biobank. The modes represent different aspects of brain aging, showing distinct patterns of functional and structural brain change, and distinct patterns of association with genetics, lifestyle, cognition, physical measures and disease. While conventional brain-age modelling found no genetic associations, 34 modes had genetic associations. We suggest that it is important not to treat brain aging as a single homogeneous process, and that modelling of distinct patterns of structural and functional change will reveal more biologically meaningful markers of brain aging in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Rapid reconfigurations of brain activity support efficient neuronal communication and flexible behaviour. Suboptimal brain dynamics impair this adaptability, possibly leading to functional deficiencies. We hypothesize that impaired flexibility in brain activity can lead to motor and cognitive symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD). To test this hypothesis, we studied the  functional repertoire - the number of distinct configurations of neural activity - using source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography in PD patients and controls. We found stereotyped brain dynamics and reduced flexibility in PD. The intensity of this reduction was proportional to symptoms severity, which can be explained by beta-band hyper-synchronization. Moreover, the basal ganglia were prominently involved in the abnormal patterns of brain activity. Our findings support the hypotheses that: symptoms in PD reflect impaired brain flexibility, this impairment preferentially involves the basal ganglia, and beta-band hypersynchronization is associated with reduced brain flexibility. These findings highlight the importance of extensive functional repertoires for behaviour and motor.",

    "abstract": "RNA structures possess multiple levels of structural organization. Secondary structures are made of canonical (i.e. Watson-Crick and Wobble) helices, connected by loops whose local conformations are critical determinants of global 3D architectures. Such local 3D structures consist of conserved sets of non-canonical base pairs, called RNA modules. Their prediction from sequence data is thus a milestone toward 3D structure modelling. Unfortunately, the computational efficiency and scope of the current 3D module identification methods are too limited yet to benefit from all the knowledge accumulated in modules databases. Here, we introduce BayesPairing 2, a new sequence search algorithm leveraging secondary structure tree decomposition which allows to reduce the computational complexity and improve predictions on new sequences. We benchmarked our methods on 75 modules and 6380 RNA sequences, and report accuracies that are comparable to the state of the art, with considerable running time improvements. When identifying 200 modules on a single sequence, BayesPairing 2 is over 100 times faster than its previous version, opening new doors for genome-wide applications.",

    "abstract": "Intra-cohort cannibalism is an example of a size-mediated priority effect. If early life stages cannibalize slightly smaller individuals, then parents face a trade-off between breeding at the best time for larval growth or development and predation risk from offspring born earlier. This game-theoretic situation among parents may drive adaptive reproductive phenology towards earlier breeding. However, it is not straightforward to quantify how cannibalism affects seasonal egg fitness or to distinguish emergent breeding phenology from alternative adaptive drivers. Here, we devise an age-structured game-theoretic mathematical model to find evolutionary stable breeding phenologies. We predict how size-dependent cannibalism acting on eggs, larvae, or both change emergent breeding phenology, and find that breeding under inter-cohort cannibalism occurs earlier than the optimal match to environmental conditions. We show that emergent breeding phenology patterns at the level of the population are sensitive to the ontogeny of cannibalism, i.e. which life stage is subject to cannibalism. This suggests that the nature of cannibalism among early life stages is a potential driver of the diversity of reproductive phenologies seen across taxa, and may be a contributing factor in situations where breeding occurs earlier than expected from environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Computer-aided detection of brain lesions from volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is in demand for fast and automatic diagnosis of neural diseases. The template-matching technique can provide satisfactory outcome for automatic localization of brain lesions; however, finding the optimal template size that maximizes similarity of the template and the lesion remains challenging. This increases the complexity of the algorithm and the requirement for computational resources, while processing large MRI volumes with three-dimensional (3D) templates. Hence, reducing the computational complexity of template matching is needed. In this paper, we first propose a mathematical framework for computing the normalized cross-correlation coefficient (NCCC) as the similarity measure between the MRI volume and approximated 3D Gaussian template with linear time complexity, [Formula], as opposed to the conventional fast Fourier transform (FFT) based approach with the complexity [Formula], where N is the number of voxels in the image and amax is the number of tried template radii. We then propose a mathematical formulation to analytically estimate the optimal template radius for each voxel in the image and compute the NCCC with the location-dependent optimal radius, reducing the complexity to [Formula]. We test our methods on one synthetic and two real multiple-sclerosis databases, and compare their performances in lesion detection with FFT and a state-of-the-art lesion prediction algorithm. We demonstrate through our experiments the efficiency of the proposed methods for brain lesion detection and their comparable performance with existing techniques.",

Six genes with various expression levels were targeted using lentiviral sgRNA from two libraries in four cell clones with various KRAB-dCas9 expression levels. We determined the knockdown efficiency and the expression level of the dCas9 protein /sgRNA level by flow cytometry. The cell clone with the highest KRAB-dCas9 expression level achieved effective CRISPRi knockdown, and is statistically different from other clones, indicating enough KRAB-dCas9 expression might be a prerequisite for CRISPRi. Utilizing this clone, we modified the expression level of sgRNA by adopting different multiplicity of infection (MOI)in lentiviral transduction and found that the knockdown efficiency was neither affected by the target gene expression level nor does it correlate with KRAB-dCas9 level, which remained relatively constant (CV=2.2%) across knockdown experiments. 74.72%, 72.28%, 39.08% knockdown of mmadhc, rpia, znf148 genes were achieved, and the knockdown efficiency correlated well with the sgRNA expression level. Linear regression modeling of the data revealed that the knockdown efficiency is significantly affected by both KRAB-dCas9 and sgRNA level, and the sgRNA level has a greater impact, based on the standardized coefficient (0.525 for KRAB-dCas9, 0.981 for sgRNA), indicating that sgRNA level is a major factor affecting CRISPRi efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic regulation has emerged as an effective strategy to improve product titers by balancing metabolic networks, which can be implemented by coupling gene expression to pathway-independent regulatory elements, such as quorum-sensing (QS) systems. However, these QS-based circuits are often created on heterologous systems and must be carefully tuned through tedious testing and optimization process to make them work well, which hampers their application in industrial microbes including streptomycetes. In this study, we design a pathway-independent QS circuit by directly integrating an endogenous QS system with CRISPRi (named EQCi) in the industrial rapamycin-producing strain Streptomyces rapamycinicus. EQCi has the advantages of both the QS system and CRISPRi, which enables tunable, fully autonomous and dynamic regulation of multiple targets simultaneously. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we downregulate three key nodes in essential pathways separately to divert metabolic flux toward rapamycin biosynthesis. In each case, significant increases in rapamycin titers are achieved. We further apply EQCi to simultaneously control these three key nodes with proper repression strength by changing sgRNA targeting positions. The final rapamycin titer reaches to 1836{+/-}191 mg/L, which is the highest reported titer. Notably, compared to traditional static engineering strategy, which result in growth arrest and suboptimal rapamycin titers, EQCi regulation substantially promote rapamycin titers without affecting cell growth, which indicates that it can achieve the trade-off between essential pathways and product synthesis. Collectively, this study provides a simple and effective strategy for optimizing product titers and may have the potential to apply to other industrial microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Missense variants in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) gene, SCN8A, are linked to early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy type 13 (EIEE13). EIEE13 patients exhibit a wide spectrum of intractable seizure types, severe developmental delay, movement disorders, and elevated risk of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). The mechanisms by which SCN8A variants lead to epilepsy are poorly understood, although heterologous expression systems and mouse models have demonstrated altered sodium current (INa) properties. To investigate these mechanisms using a patient-specific model system, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from three patients with missense variants in SCN8A: p.R1872>L (P1); p.V1592>L (P2); and p.N1759>S (P3). Using small molecule differentiation into excitatory neurons, iPSC-derived neurons from all three patients displayed altered INa. P1 and P2 had elevated persistent INa, while P3 had increased resurgent INa compared to controls. Further analyses focused on one of the patients with increased persistent INa (P1) and the patient with increased resurgent INa (P3). Excitatory cortical neurons from both patients had prolonged action potential (AP) repolarization and shorter axon initial segment lengths compared to controls, the latter analyzed by immunostaining for ankyrin-G. Using doxycycline-inducible expression of the neuronal transcription factors Neurogenin 1 and 2 to synchronize differentiation of induced excitatory cortical-like neurons (iNeurons), we investigated network activity and response to pharmacotherapies. Both patient neurons and iNeurons displayed similar abnormalities in AP repolarization. Patient iNeurons showed increased burstiness that was sensitive to phenytoin, currently a standard treatment for EIEE patients, or riluzole, an FDA-approved drug used in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and known to block persistent and resurgent INa, at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Patch-clamp recordings showed that riluzole suppressed spontaneous firing and increased the AP firing threshold of patient-derived neurons to more depolarized potentials. Our results indicate that patient-specific neurons are useful for modeling EIEE13 and demonstrate SCN8A variant-specific mechanisms. Moreover, these findings suggest that patient-specific iPSC neuronal disease modeling offers a useful platform for discovering precision epilepsy therapies.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYMost loci identified by GWAS have been found in populations of European ancestry (EA). In trans-ethnic meta-analyses for 15 hematological traits in 746,667 participants, including 184,535 non-EA individuals, we identified 5,552 trait-variant associations at P<5x10-9, including 71 novel loci not found in EA populations. We also identified novel ancestry-specific variants not found in EA, including an IL7 missense variant in South Asians associated with lymphocyte count in vivo and IL7 secretion levels in vitro. Fine-mapping prioritized variants annotated as functional, and generated 95% credible sets that were 30% smaller when using the trans-ethnic as opposed to the EA-only results. We explored the clinical significance and predictive value of trans-ethnic variants in multiple populations, and compared genetic architecture and the impact of natural selection on these blood phenotypes between populations. Altogether, our results for hematological traits highlight the value of a more global representation of populations in genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "Patients with COPD have many anomalies in their airway epithelium, and their basal stem/progenitor cells show a decrease in self-renewal and differentiation potential. The objective of this study was to identify deregulations in the genetic program of COPD bronchial basal stem/progenitor cells that could account for their exhaustion. TGF-{beta} is found at higher levels in the lungs of COPD subjects. It has been shown to play a role in stem/progenitor cell fate and also to regulate the expression of the EMT-inducing transcription factor Slug/Snail2. In contrast to other transcription factors of the Snail family, Slug is highly expressed in basal progenitor cells, the adult stem/progenitors of human airway epithelium. We aimed at identifying genes downstream of Slug that respond to TGF-{beta}, and whose expression is deregulated in COPD airway basal stem/progenitor cells, and could account for the decrease in count and functional ability of these cells observed in COPD. For this, we knocked down Slug in primary bronchial basal progenitor cells from COPD and normal subjects and, among the genes downstream of Slug, we selected those responding to TGF-{beta} and differentiation. We identified 5 genes coding for transcription factors involved in stem cell maintenance that are repressed downstream of Slug and by TGF-{beta} in COPD but not normal basal progenitor cells. Our results bring a molecular perspective to the exhaustion of airway basal stem/progenitor cells observed in COPD by revealing that stem cell maintenance genes are repressed in these cells, with TGF-{beta} and Slug being involved in this deregulation.",

These sequences were combined with 718 whole genome and 1,987 VP1-gene publicly available sequences.\n\nFindingsIn 2018, circulating strains clustered into multiple subgroups in the B3 and A2 subclades, with different phylogenetic origins. Clusters in subclade B3 emerged from strains circulating primarily in the US and Europe in 2016, though some had deeper roots linking to Asian strains, while clusters in A2 traced back to strains detected in East Asia in 2015-2016. In 2018, all sequences from the USA formed a distinct subgroup, containing only three non-US samples. Alongside the varied origins of seasonal strains, we found that diversification of these variants begins up to 18 months prior to the first diagnostic detection during a EV-D68 season. EV-D68 displays strong signs of continuous antigenic evolution and all 2018 A2 strains had novel patterns in the putative neutralizing epitopes in the BC- and DE-loops. The pattern in the BC-loop of the USA B3 subgroup had not been detected on that continent before. Patients with EV-D68 in subclade A2 were significantly older than patients with a B3 subclade virus. In contrast to other subclades, the age distribution of A2 is distinctly bimodal and was found primarily among children and in the elderly.\n\nInterpretationWe hypothesize that EV-D68s rapid evolution of surface proteins, extensive diversity, and high rate of geographic mixing could be explained by substantial reinfection of adults.\n\nFundingUniversity of Basel and Swedish Foundation for Research and Development in Medical Microbiology",

Features of myofiber types can be distinguished by the expression of myosin heavy chain (MyHC) isoforms, indicating contraction properties. In most studies, a local sampling, typically obtained from the median part of the muscle, is used to represent the whole muscle. It remains largely unknown to what extent this local sampling represents the entire muscle. Here we studied myofiber architecture over the entire wild type mouse tibialis anterior muscle, using a high-throughput procedure combining automatic imaging and image processing analyses. We reconstructed myofiber architecture from consecutive cross-sections stained for laminin and MyHC isoforms. The data showed a marked variation in myofiber geometric features, as well as MyHC expression and the distribution of neuromuscular junctions, and suggest that muscle regions with distinct properties can be defined along the entire muscle. We show that in these muscle regions myofiber geometric properties align with biological function and propose that future studies on muscle alterations in pathological or physiological conditions should consider the entire muscle.",

A number of phenotypic variables were found to associate with immune subtypes, such as nonsilent mutation rates, regulation of immunomodulator genes, and cytokine network structures. An ensemble classifier based on XGBoost is introduced with the goal of classifying tumor samples into one of six immune subtypes. Robust performance was accomplished through feature engineering; quartile-levels, binary gene-pair features, and gene-set-pair features were computed for each sample independently. The classifier is robust to software pipeline and normalization scheme, making it applicable to any expression data format from raw count data to TPMs since the classification is essentially based on simple binary gene-gene level comparisons within a given sample.

However, it is not known if the absence in monotremes is secondary to the loss of dentition, or if it is an ancestral absence. We use museum held platypus and echidna histological sections to demonstrate that the developing monotreme jaw joint forms a disc primordium that fails to mature and become separated from the mandibular condyle. We then show that monotreme developmental anatomy is similar to that observed in transgenic mouse mutants with reduced musculature. We therefore suggest that the absence of the disc on monotremes is a consequence of the changes in jaw musculature associated with the loss of adult teeth. Taken together, these data indicate that the ancestors of extant monotremes likely had a jaw joint disc, and that the disc evolved in the last common ancestor or all mammals.",

    "abstract": "Organism abundance is a critical parameter in ecology, but its estimation is often challenging. Approaches utilizing eDNA to indirectly estimate abundance have recently generated substantial interest. However, preliminary correlations observed between eDNA concentration and abundance in nature are typically moderate in strength with significant unexplained variation. Here we apply a novel approach to integrate allometric scaling coefficients into models of eDNA concentration and organism abundance. We hypothesize that eDNA particle production scales non-linearly with mass, with scaling coefficients < 1. Wild populations often exhibit substantial variation in individual body size distributions; we therefore predict that the distribution of mass across individuals within a population will influence population-level eDNA production rates. To test our hypothesis, we collected standardized body size distribution and mark-recapture abundance data using whole-lake experiments involving nine populations of brook trout. We correlated eDNA concentration with three metrics of abundance: density (individuals/ha), biomass (kg/ha), and allometrically scaled mass (ASM) ({sum}(individual mass0.73)/ha). Density and biomass were both significantly positively correlated with eDNA concentration (adj. R2 = 0.59 and 0.63, respectively), but ASM exhibited improved model fit (adj. R2 = 0.78). We also demonstrate how estimates of ASM derived from eDNA samples in  unknown systems can be converted to biomass or density estimates with additional size structure data. Future experiments should empirically validate allometric scaling coefficients for eDNA production, particularly where substantial intraspecific size distribution variation exists. Incorporating allometric scaling may improve predictive models to the extent that eDNA concentration may become a reliable indicator of abundance in nature.",

However, it remains unclear to what degree transport will be recapitulated in the substantially larger and more complex nonhuman primate (NHP) brain. Here, we compared the biodistribution of AAV2.retro with its parent serotype, AAV2, in adult macaques following delivery into the caudate and putamen, brain regions which comprise the striatum. While AAV2 transduction was primarily limited to the injected brain regions, AAV2.retro transduced cells in the striatum and in dozens of cortical and subcortical regions with known striatal afferents. We then evaluated the capability of AAV2.retro to deliver disease-related gene cargo to biologically-relevant NHP brain circuits by packaging a fragment of human mutant HTT, the causative gene mutation in Huntingtons disease. Following intra-striatal delivery, pathological mHTT-positive protein aggregates were distributed widely among cognitive, motor, and limbic cortico-basal ganglia circuits. Together, these studies demonstrate strong retrograde transport of AAV2.retro in NHP brain, highlight its utility in developing novel NHP models of brain disease and suggest its potential for querying circuit function and delivering therapeutic genes in the brain, particularly where treating dysfunctional circuits, versus single brain regions, is warranted.",

We aimed to map deviations from normative ranges of brain structure for individual patients and evaluate whether the loci of individual deviations recapitulated group-average brain maps of schizophrenia pathology.\n\nMethodsFor each of 48 white matter tracts and 68 cortical regions, normative percentiles of variation in fractional anisotropy (FA) and cortical thickness (CT) were established using diffusion-weighted and structural MRI from healthy adults (n=195). Individuals with schizophrenia (n=322) were classified as either within the normative range for healthy individuals of the same age and sex (5-95% percentiles), infra-normal (<5% percentile) or supra-normal (>95% percentile). Repeating this classification for each tract and region yielded a deviation map for each individual.\n\nResultsCompared to the healthy comparison group, the schizophrenia group showed widespread reductions in FA and CT, involving virtually all white matter tracts and cortical regions. Paradoxically, however, no more than 15-20% of patients deviated from the normative range for any single tract or region, whereas 79% of patients showed infra-normal deviations for at least one locus (healthy individuals: 59{+/-}2%, p<0.001). Higher polygenic risk for schizophrenia associated with a greater number of regions with infra-normal deviations in CT (r=-0.17, p=0.006).\n\nConclusionsAnatomical loci of schizophrenia-related changes are highly heterogeneous across individuals to the extent that group-consensus pathological maps are not representative of most individual patients.

Previous research exploring insect brain connectivity has used microscopy techniques, but this methodology is time consuming and cannot be applied to living animals and so cannot be used to understand dynamic physiological processes. The relatively large brain of the desert locust, Schistercera gregaria (Forks[a]l) is ideal for exploring a novel methodology; diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) for the characterization of neuronal connectivity in an insect brain. The diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were acquired on a preclinical system using a customised multi-shell diffusion MRI scheme. Endogenous imaging contrasts from the averaged DWIs and Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) scheme were applied to classify various anatomical features and diffusion patterns in neuropils, respectively. The application of micro-MRI and dMRI modelling to the locust brain provides a novel means of identifying anatomical regions and connectivity in an insect brain. Furthermore, quantitative imaging indices derived from the kurtosis model that include fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD) and kurtosis anisotropy (KA) could, in future, be used to quantify longitudinal structural changes in neuronal connectivity due to environmental stressors or ageing.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) in the resting state (rs) is considered as a correlate of cognitive processing. Describing dFC as a flow across morphing connectivity configurations, our notion of dFC speed quantifies the rate at which FC networks evolve in time. Here we probe the hypothesis that variations of rs dFC speed and cognitive performance are selectively interrelated within specific functional subnetworks.\n\nIn particular, we focus on Sleep Deprivation (SD) as a reversible model of cognitive dysfunction. We found that whole-brain level (global) dFC speed significantly slows down after 24h of SD. However, the reduction in global dFC speed does not correlate with variations of cognitive performance in individual tasks, which are subtle and highly heterogeneous. On the contrary, we found strong correlations between performance variations in individual tasks -including Rapid Visual Processing (RVP, assessing sustained visual attention)- and dFC speed quantified at the level of functional subnetworks of interest. Providing a compromise between classic static FC (no time) and global dFC (no space), modular dFC speed analyses allow quantifying a different speed of dFC reconfiguration independently for sub-networks overseeing different tasks. Importantly, we found that RVP performance robustly correlates with the modular dFC speed of a characteristic frontoparietal module.\n\nHighlightsO_LISleep Deprivation (SD) slows down the random walk in FC space implemented by Dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) at rest.\nC_LIO_LIWhole-brain level slowing of dFC speed does not selectively correlate with fine and taskspecific changes in performance\nC_LIO_LIWe quantify dFC speed separately for different link-based modules coordinated by distinct regional \"meta-hubs\"\nC_LIO_LIModular dFC speed variations capture subtle and task-specific variations of cognitive performance induced by SD.\nC_LI\n\nAuthor summaryWe interpreted dynamic Functional Connectivity (dFC) as a random walk in the space of possible FC networks performed with a quantifiable \"speed\".\n\nHere, we analyze a fMRI dataset in which subjects are scanned and cognitively tested both before and after Sleep Deprivation (SD), used as a reversible model of cognitive dysfunction. While global dFC speed slows down after a sleepless night, it is not a sufficiently sensitive metric to correlate with fine and specific cognitive performance changes. To boost the capacity of dFC speed analyses to account for fine and specific cognitive decline, we introduce the notion of modular dFC speed. Capitalizing on an edge-centric measure of functional connectivity, which we call Meta-Connectivity, we isolate subgraphs of FC describing relatively independent random walks (dFC modules) and controlled by distinct \"puppet masters\" (meta-hubs). We then find that variations of the random walk speed of distinct dFC modules now selectively correlate with SD-induced variations of performance in the different tasks. This is in agreement with the fact that different subsystems - distributed but functionally distinct- oversee different tasks.\n\nThe high sensitivity of modular dFC analyses bear promise of future applications to the early detection and longitudinal characterization of pathologies such as Alzheimers disease.",

The signature can store behavioral representations and is modified in mouse genetic models of human disease. The human synaptome remains unexplored and whether it has any conserved features with the mouse synaptome is unknown.\n\nAs a first step toward creating a human synaptome atlas, we have labelled and imaged synapses expressing the excitatory synapse protein PSD95 in twenty human brain regions in four phenotypically normal individuals. We quantified the number, size and intensity of approximately a billion individual synaptic puncta and compared their regional distributions. We found that each region showed a distinct signature of synaptic puncta parameters. Comparison of brain regions showed the synaptome of cortical and hippocampal structures were similar but distinct to the synaptome of cerebellum and brainstem. Comparison of human and mouse synaptome revealed conservation of synaptic puncta parameters, hierarchical organization of brain regions and network architecture. These data show that the synaptome of humans and mouse share conserved features despite the 1000-fold difference in brain size and 90 million years since a common ancestor. This first draft human synaptome atlas illustrates the feasibility of generating a systematic atlas of the human synaptome in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is considered a dangerous pathogen due to its ability to evade the immune system and resist multiple antibiotics. These evasive strategies lead to difficult-to-treat chronic infections and abscesses in internal organs including kidneys, which are associated with the expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and their suppressive effect on T cells. Here, we developed a mathematical model of chronic S. aureus infection that incorporates the T-cell suppression by MDSCs and suggests therapeutic strategies to eradicate S. aureus. We quantified in silico a therapeutic protocol with heat-killed S. aureus (HKSA), which we tested in vivo. Contrary to conventional administration of heat-killed bacteria as vaccination prior to infection, we administered HKSA as treatment, when the hosts were already chronically infected. Our treatment cured all chronically S. aureus-infected mice, reduced MDSCs, and reversed T-cell dysfunction by inducing acute inflammation during ongoing, chronic infection without any use of standard treatments that involve antibiotics, MDSC-targeting drugs (chemotherapy), or procedures such as abscess drainage. This study is a proof-of-principle for a treatment protocol against chronic S. aureus infection and renal abscesses by repurposing heat-killed treatments, guided and quantified by mathematical modelling. Our mathematical model further explains why previous treatment with inactivated S. aureus administered to long-term infected human patients has not led to cure. Overall, our results can have direct relevance to the design of human therapeutics against chronic S. aureus infections.\n\nIn briefA theory-driven treatment protocol with heat-killed S. aureus eradicates S. aureus, reduces MDSCs, and reverses T-cell dysfunction in vivo.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=157 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/910786v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e2d0c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f97374org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b0235org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bdf2ee_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Columba livia is a wild bird whose domestication has led to a large number of pigeon breeds. The occasional loss or straying of domestic birds determined the origin of feral pigeons, which are now widespread all around the world. In this study, we assumed that the main contribution to feral populations is provided by domestic breeds reared in the same areas. We tested this hypothesis by analysing the variability of 12 microsatellite loci in nine Italian feral populations sampled in areas with different intensities of breeding and selecting domestic breeds. We included in the analysis samples belonging to domestic lineages commonly bred in Italy The pattern of geographic differentiation of feral populations turned out to be rather complex and only partially explained by the geographic distance between populations. This pattern can be understood only when the domestic breeds were included in the analysis. In particular, feral populations located in regions with a long-lasting tradition of pigeon breeding showed a high level of admixture with domestic breeds, in particular with Racing Homer and Piacentino. Ferals from Bolzano, Venice and Sassari were characterized by unique genetic components, almost all of which are not shared by other feral populations and by the considered domestic breeds. Our results further emphasize the complex origin of feral populations which can be properly investigated only by considering the pool of domestic pigeons bred in the considered area and their past and present distribution.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveAvoidance of the adverse electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interface defines the voltage safety window and limits the charge injection capacity (CIC) of an electrode material. For an electrode that is not ideally capacitive, the CIC depends on the waveform of the stimulus. We study the modeling of the charge injection dynamics to optimize the waveforms for efficient neural stimulation within the electrochemical safety limits.\n\nApproachThe charge injection dynamics at the electrode-electrolyte interface is typically characterized by the electrochemical impedance spectrum, and is often approximated by discrete-element circuit models. We compare the modeling of the complete circuit, including a non-linear driver such as a photodiode, based on the harmonic-balance (HB) analysis with the analysis based on various discrete element approximations. To validate the modeling results, we performed experiments with iridium-oxide electrodes driven by a current source with diodes in parallel, which mimics a photovoltaic circuit.\n\nMain resultsApplication of HB analysis based on a full impedance spectrum in frequency domain eliminates the complication of finding the discrete-element circuit model in traditional approaches. HB-based results agree with the experimental data better than the discrete-element circuit analysis. HB technique can be applied not only to demonstrate the circuit response to periodic stimulation, but also to describe the initial transient behavior when a burst waveform is applied.\n\nSignificanceHB-based circuit analysis accurately describes the dynamics of electrode-electrolyte interfaces and driving circuits for all pulsing schemes. This allows optimizing the stimulus waveform to maximize the CIC, based on the impedance spectrum alone.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome shotgun sequencing enables the analysis of microbial communities in unprecedented detail, with major implications in medicine and ecology. Predicting the presence and relative abundances of microbes in a sample, known as \"metagenomic profiling\", is a critical first step in microbiome analysis. Existing profiling methods have been shown to suffer from poor false positive or false negative rates, while alignment-based approaches are often considered accurate but computationally infeasible. Here we present a novel method, Metalign, that addresses these concerns by performing efficient alignment-based metagenomic profiling. We use a containment min hash approach to reduce the reference database size dramatically before alignment and a method to estimate organism relative abundances in the sample by resolving reads aligned to multiple genomes. We show that Metalign achieves significantly improved results over existing methods on simulated datasets from a large benchmarking study, CAMI, and performs well on in vitro mock community data and environmental data from the Tara Oceans project.

    "abstract": "Dynamic co-regulation of the actin and microtubule subsystems enables the highly precise and adaptive remodeling of the cytoskeleton necessary for critical cellular processes, like axonal pathfinding. The modes and mediators of this interpolymer crosstalk, however, are inadequately understood.\n\nWe identify Fmn2, a non-diaphanous related formin associated with cognitive disabilities, as a novel regulator of cooperative actin-microtubule remodeling in growth cones. We show that Fmn2 stabilizes microtubules in the growth cones of cultured spinal neurons and also in vivo. Superresolution imaging revealed that Fmn2 facilitates guidance of exploratory microtubules along actin bundles into the chemosensory filopodia. Using live imaging, biochemistry and single-molecule assays we show that a C-terminal domain in Fmn2 is necessary for the dynamic association between microtubules and actin filaments. In the absence of the cross-bridging function of Fmn2, filopodial capture of microtubules is compromised resulting in de-stabilized filopodial protrusions and deficits in growth cone chemotaxis.\n\nOur results uncover a critical function for Fmn2 in actin-microtubule crosstalk in neurons and demonstrate that modulating microtubule dynamics via associations with F-actin is central to directional motility.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe formin family member, Fmn2, is associated with cognitive impairment and neurodegenerative conditions though its function in neurons is poorly characterized. We report a novel actin-microtubule cross-bridging activity for Fmn2 that facilitates efficient targeting and capture of microtubules in growth cone filopodia. This activity is necessary for accurate pathfinding of axons and may contribute to Fmn2-associated neuropathologies.\n\nThe precision and adaptability of cytoskeleton-driven processes are intimately dependent on the coupled activities of its component systems. Our study identifies a novel modality of co-regulated remodelling of the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons that facilitate critical cellular behaviour like neuronal chemotaxis.",

    "abstract": "Dorsal-ventral patterning of the Drosophila embryo depends on the NF{kappa}B superfamily transcription factor Dorsal (Dl). Toll receptor activation signals for degradation of the I{kappa}B inhibitor Cactus (Cact), leading to a ventral-to-dorsal nuclear Dl gradient. Cact is critical for Dl nuclear import, as it binds to and prevents Dl from entering the nuclei. Quantitative analysis of cact mutants revealed an additional Cact function to promote Dl nuclear translocation in ventral regions of the embryo. To investigate this dual Cact role, we developed a predictive model based on a reaction-diffusion regulatory network. This network considers non-uniform Toll activation as well as Toll-dependent Dl nuclear import and Cact degradation. In addition, it incorporates translational control of Cact levels by Dl, a Toll-independent pathway for Cact regulation and reversible nuclear-cytoplasmic Dl flow. Our model successfully reproduces wild-type data and emulates the Dl nuclear gradient in mutant dl and cact allelic combinations. Our results indicate that the dual role of Cact depends on targeting distinct Dl complexes along the dorsal-ventral axis: In the absence of Toll activation, free Dl-Cact trimers inhibit direct Dl nuclear entry; upon ventral-lateral Toll activation, Dl-Cact trimers are recruited into predominant signaling complexes and promote active Dl nuclear translocation. Simulations suggest that Toll-independent regulatory mechanisms that target Cact are fundamental to reproduce the full assortment of Cact effects. Considering the high evolutionary conservation of these pathways, our analysis should contribute to understand NF{kappa}B/c-Rel activation in other contexts such as in the vertebrate immune system and disease.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection imposes a complex filter on which variants persist in a population resulting in evolutionary patterns that vary greatly along the genome. Some sites evolve close to neutrally, while others are highly conserved, allow only specific states or only change in concert with other sites. Most commonly used evolutionary models, however, ignore much of this complexity and at best account for variation in the rate at which different sites change. Here, we present an efficient algorithm to estimate more complex models that allow for site-specific preferences and explore the accuracy at which such models can be estimated from simulated data. We find that an iterative approximate maximum likelihood scheme uses information in the data efficiently and accurately estimates site-specific preferences from large data sets with moderately diverged sequences. Ignoring site-specific preferences during estimation of branch length of phylogenetic trees - an assumption of most phylogeny software - results in substantial underestimation comparable to the error incurred when ignoring rate variation. However, the joint estimation of branch lengths, site-specific rates, and site-specific preferences can suffer from identifiability problems and is typically unable to recover the correct branch lengths. Site-specific preferences estimated from large HIV pol alignments show qualitative concordance with intra-host estimates of fitness costs. Analysis of site-specific HIV substitution models suggests near saturation of divergence after a few hundred years. Such saturation can explain the inability to infer deep divergence times of HIV and SIVs using molecular clock approaches and time-dependent rate estimates.",

Some chips also had a saturated long-chain fatty acid (hexadecanoic acid, 16:0) added (0.2%) to evaluate its effect on fattiness and liking. We computed the heritability of these measures and conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify regions of the genome that co-segregate with fattiness and liking. Perceived fattiness and liking for the potato chips were reliable (r = 0.31-0.62, p < 0.05) and heritable (up to h2 = 0.29, p < 0.001, for liking). Adding hexadecanoic acid to the potato chips significantly increased ratings of fattiness but decreased liking. Twins with the G allele of rs263429 near GATA3-AS1 or the G allele of rs8103990 within ZNF729 reported more liking for potato chips than did twins with the other allele (multivariate GWAS, p < 1x10-5), with results reaching genome-wide suggestive but not significance criteria. Person-to-person variation in the perception and liking of dietary fat was (a) negatively affected by the addition of a saturated fatty acid and (b) related to inborn genetic variants. These data suggest liking for dietary fat is not due solely to fatty acid content and highlight new candidate genes and proteins within this sensory pathway.",

Several factors trigger biofilm formation including response to competition. Urinary tract infections (UTI) are highly prevalent worldwide and mainly caused by uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), which progresses into chronic form due to the biofilm formation by the pathogen. In this study, we hypothesized that competition for territorial space could occur between species by intervening in the biofilm matrix production, particularly of UPEC, thereby reducing its colonizing ability. UPEC colony displays different morphology in congo red media based on matrix production, which we exploited for screening bacterial isolates capable of inhibiting the matrix. This was validated by using the cell-free supernatants of the isolates to impair UPEC biofilm. Isolates that inhibited matrix production belonged to species of Shigella, Escherichia, Enterobacter, and Salmonella from Enterobacteriaceae family. Competition experiments between the isolates and UPEC revealed spiteful interactions particularly during biofilm formation, indicating fierce competition for territorial space colonization. The isolate Salmonella enterica B1 could competitively exclude UPEC in the biofilm. Altogether, we show that interference competition by matrix inhibition occurs as a strategy by bacteria to colonize territorial space.",

While previous studies using pattern recognition on neuroimaging data have shown differences between various discrete emotions in brain activity patterns, less is known about the differences in functional connectivity. Thus, we employed multivariate pattern analysis on functional magnetic resonance imaging data (i) to develop a pipeline for applying pattern recognition in functional connectivity data, and (ii) to test whether connectivity signatures differ across emotions. Six emotions (anger, fear, disgust, happiness, sadness, and surprise) and a neutral state were induced in 16 participants using one-minute-long emotional narratives with natural prosody while brain activity was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We computed emotion-wise connectivity matrices both for whole-brain connections and for 10 previously defined functionally connected brain subnetworks, and trained an across-participant classifier to categorize the emotional states based on whole-brain data and for each subnetwork separately. The whole-brain classifier performed above chance level with all emotions except sadness, suggesting that different emotions are characterized by differences in large-scale connectivity patterns. When focusing on the connectivity within the 10 subnetworks, classification was successful within the default mode system and for all emotions. We conclude that functional connectivity patterns consistently differ across different emotions particularly within the default mode system.",

    "abstract": "Limited accessibility of retinal neurons to electrophysiology on a cellular scale in-vivo has restricted studies of their signaling to in-vitro preparations and animal models. Physiological changes underlying neural activity are mediated by variations in electrical potential that alter the surface tension of the cell membrane. In addition, physiological processes affect concentration of the cells constituents that results in variation of osmotic pressure. Both these phenomena affect the neurons shape which can be detected using interferometric imaging, thereby enabling non-invasive label-free imaging of physiological activity in-vivo with cellular resolution. Here, we apply high-speed phase-resolved optical coherence tomography in line-field configuration to image the biophysical phenomena associated with phototransduction in human cone photoreceptors in vivo. We demonstrate that individual cones exhibit a biphasic response to light: an early ms-scale fast contraction of the outer segment immediately after the onset of the flash stimulus followed by a gradual (hundreds of ms) expansion. We demonstrate that the contraction can be explained by rapid charge movement accompanying the isomerization of cone opsins, consistent with the early receptor potential observed in the electroretinogram and classical electrophysiology in-vitro. We demonstrate the fidelity of such all-optical recording of light-induced activity in the human retina, namely the optoretinogram, across a range of spatiotemporal scales. This approach incorporates functional evaluation into a routine clinical examination of retinal structure and thus holds enormous potential to serve as a biomarker for early disease diagnosis and monitoring therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The reproducibility crisis in science is a multifaceted problem involving practices and incentives, both in the laboratory and in publication. Fortunately, some of the root causes are known and can be addressed by scientists and authors alike. After careful consideration of the available literature, the National Institutes of Health identified several key problems with the way that scientists conduct and report their research and introduced guidelines to improve the rigor and reproducibility of pre-clinical studies. Many journals have implemented policies addressing these same criteria. We currently have, however, no comprehensive data on how these guidelines are impacting the reporting of research. Using SciScore, an automated tool developed to review the methods sections of manuscripts for the presence of criteria associated with the NIH and other reporting guidelines, e.g., ARRIVE, RRIDs, we have analyzed ~1.6 million PubMed Central papers to determine the degree to which articles were addressing these criteria. The tool scores each paper on a ten point scale identifying sentences that are associated with compliance with criteria associated with increased rigor (5 pts) and those associated with key resource identification and authentication (5 pts). From these data, we have built the Rigor and Transparency Index, which is the average score for analyzed papers in a particular journal. Our analyses show that the average score over all journals has increased since 1997, but remains below five, indicating that less than half of the rigor and reproducibility criteria are routinely addressed by authors. To analyze the data further, we examined the prevalence of individual criteria across the literature, e.g., the reporting of a subject\u2019s sex (21-37% of studies between 1997 and 2019), the inclusion of sample size calculations (2-10%), whether the study addressed blinding (3-9%), or the identifiability of key biological resources such as antibodies (11-43%), transgenic organisms (14-22%), and cell lines (33-39%). The greatest increase in prevalence for rigor criteria was seen in the use of randomization of subjects (10-30%), while software tool identifiability improved the most among key resource types (42-87%). We further analyzed individual journals over time that had implemented specific author guidelines covering rigor criteria, and found that in some journals, they had a big impact, whereas in others they did not. We speculate that unless they are enforced, author guidelines alone do little to improve the number of criteria addressed by authors. Our Rigor and Transparency Index did not correlate with the impact factors of journals.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Network analysis represents a valuable and flexible framework to understand the structure of individual interactions at the population level in animal societies. The versatility of network representations is moreover suited to different types of datasets describing these interactions. However, depending on the data collection method, different pictures of the social bonds between individuals could a priori emerge. Understanding how the data collection method influences the description of the social structure of a group is thus essential to assess the reliability of social studies based on different types of data. This is however rarely feasible, especially for animal groups, where data collection is often challenging. Here, we address this issue by comparing datasets of interactions between primates collected through two different methods: behavioral observations and wearable proximity sensors. We show that, although many directly observed interactions are not detected by the sensors, the global pictures obtained when aggregating the data to build interaction networks turn out to be remarkably similar. Sensors data yield moreover a reliable social network already over short timescales and can be used for long term campaigns, showing their important potential for detailed studies of the evolution of animal social groups.",

    "abstract": "De novo emergence, and emergence of the earliest proteins specifically, demands a transition from disordered polypeptides into structured proteins with well-defined functions. However, can peptides confer evolutionary relevant functions, let alone with minimal abiotic amino acid alphabets? How can such polypeptides evolve into mature proteins? Specifically, while nucleic acids binding is presumed a primordial function, it demands basic amino acids that do not readily form abiotically. To address these questions, we describe an experimentally-validated trajectory from a phase-separating polypeptide to a dsDNA-binding protein. The intermediates comprise sequence-duplicated, functional proteins made of only 10 amino acid types, with ornithine, which can form abiotically, as the only basic amino acid. Statistical, chemical modification of ornithine sidechains to arginine promoted structure and function. The function concomitantly evolved - from phase separation with RNA (coacervates) to avid and specific dsDNA binding - thereby demonstrating a smooth, gradual peptide-to-protein transition with respect to sequence, structure, and function.",

However, even in the most well-studied of organisms, the bacterium Escherichia coli, for {approx} 65% of the promoters we remain completely ignorant of their regulation. Until we have cracked this regulatory Rosetta Stone, efforts to read and write genomes will remain haphazard. We introduce a new method (Reg-Seq) linking a massively-parallel reporter assay and mass spectrometry to produce a base pair resolution dissection of more than 100 promoters in E. coli in 12 different growth conditions. First, we show that our method recapitulates regulatory information from known sequences. Then, we examine the regulatory architectures for more than 80 promoters in the E. coli genome which previously had no known regulation. In many cases, we also identify which transcription factors mediate their regulation. The method introduced here clears a path for fully characterizing the regulatory genome of model organisms, with the potential of moving on to an array of other microbes of ecological and medical relevance.",

Piecewise Joint Latent Class Models allowed to identify patterns of adversity trajectories and test the introduction of breakpoints in life-paths. The classes inferred from the optimal model were compared in terms of socio-demographics, psychopathology and nature of experienced events.\n\nResultsThe most accurate model derived 2 trajectory patterns with a breakpoint in early adolescence. In the first class (n = 43 individuals), the burden of adversity increased steadily from birth to death, which occurred on average at 23 (SE = 1.29). In the second class (n = 259), where individuals died on average at 43 years (SE = 0.96), the burden of adversity followed a similar trajectory during infancy but stabilized between ages 10 and 14 years and rebounded at about 25. The classes differed in terms of childhood family stability, occurrence of dependent events, distal exposure to suicide and intra-family sexual victimization.\n\nConclusionAlthough subject to inherent limitations of the retrospective designs, our results encourage clinicians and researchers to pay greater attention to the diathetic maturation processes occurring during adolescence when considering suicidal behaviors in young people.",

Immunogenicity and therapeutic efficacy was analyzed in BALB/c mice.

EPIT with LamOVA induced significantly higher IgG levels than OVA, matching the levels induced by s.c. injection of OVA/alum (SCIT). EPIT was equally effective as SCIT in terms of blocking IgG induction and suppression of lung inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness, but SCIT was associated with a higher level of therapy induced IgE and TH2 cytokines. EPIT with LamOVA induced significantly lower local skin reactions during therapy compared to unconjugated OVA.\n\nConclusionConjugation of the allergen to laminarin increased its immunogenicity while at the same time reducing local side effects.

    "abstract": "Neuronal networks in rodent primary visual cortex (V1) can generate oscillations in different frequency bands depending on the network state and the level of visual stimulation. High-frequency gamma rhythms, for example, dominate the networks spontaneous activity in adult mice but are attenuated upon visual stimulation, during which the network switches to the beta band instead. The spontaneous LFP of juvenile mouse V1, however, mainly contains beta oscillations and presenting a stimulus does not elicit drastic changes in collective network oscillations. We study, in a spiking neuron network model, the mechanism in adult mice that allows for flexible switches between multiple frequency bands and contrast this to the network structure in juvenile mice that do not posses this flexibility. The model is comprised of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) and two types of inhibitory interneurons: the parvalbumin expressing (PV) interneuron, which produces gamma oscillations, and the somatostatin expressing (SOM) cell, which generates beta rhythms. Our model simulations suggest that both of these oscillations are generated by a pyramidal-interneuron gamma (PING) mechanism. Furthermore, prominent gamma and beta oscillations in, respectively, the spontaneous and visually evoked activity of the simulated network only occurred within the same network configuration when there was a balance between both types of interneurons so that SOM neurons are able to shape the dynamics of the pyramidal-PV cell subnetwork without dominating dynamics. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the effective strengths of PV and SOM cells must be balanced for experimentally observed V1 dynamics in adult mice. Moreover, since spontaneous gamma rhythms emerge during the well-known critical period, our findings support the notion that PV cells become integrated in the circuit of this cortical area during this time window and additionally indicate that this integration comprises an overall increase in their synaptic strength.",

    "abstract": "As the volume of next generation sequencing data increases, an urgent need for algorithms to efficiently process the data arises. Universal hitting sets (UHS) were recently introduced as an alternative to the central idea of minimizers in sequence analysis with the hopes that they could more efficiently address common tasks such as computing hash functions for read overlap, sparse suffix arrays, and Bloom filters. A UHS is a set of k-mers that hit every sequence of length L, and can thus serve as indices to L-long sequences. Unfortunately, methods for computing small UHSs are not yet practical for real-world sequencing instances due to their serial and deterministic nature, which leads to long runtimes and high memory demands when handling typical values of k (e.g. k > 13). To address this bottleneck, we present two algorithmic innovations to significantly decrease runtime while keeping memory usage low: (i) we leverage advanced theoretical and architectural techniques to parallelize and decrease memory usage in calculating k-mer hitting numbers; and (ii) we build upon techniques from randomized Set Cover to select universal k-mers much faster. We implemented these innovations in PASHA, the first randomized parallel algorithm for generating near-optimal UHSs, which newly handles k > 13. We demonstrate empirically that PASHA produces sets only slightly larger than those of serial deterministic algorithms; moreover, the set size is provably guaranteed to be within a small factor of the optimal size. PASHAs runtime and memory-usage improvements are orders of magnitude faster than the current best algorithms. We expect our newly-practical construction of UHSs to be adopted in many high-throughput sequence analysis pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Protein secondary structure prediction remains a vital topic with improving accuracy and broad applications. By using deep learning algorithms, prediction methods not relying on structure templates were recently reported to reach as high as 87% accuracy on 3 labels (helix, sheet or coil). Due to lack of a widely accepted standard in secondary structure predictor development and evaluation, a fair comparison of predictors is challenging. A detailed examination of factors that contribute to higher accuracy is also lacking. In this paper, we present: (1) a new test set, Test2018, consisting of proteins from structures released in 2018 with less than 25% similar to any protein published before 2018; (2) a 4-layer convolutional neural network, SecNet, with an input window of {+/-}14 amino acids which was trained on proteins less than 25% identical to proteins in Test2018 and the commonly used CB513 test set; (3) a detailed ablation study where we reverse one algorithmic choice at a time in SecNet and evaluate the effect on the prediction accuracy; (4) new 4- and 5-label prediction alphabets that may be more practical for tertiary structure prediction methods. The 3-label accuracy of the leading predictors on both Test2018 and CB513 is 81-82%, while SecNets accuracy is 84% for both sets. The ablation study of different factors (evolutionary information, neural network architecture, and training hyper-parameters) suggests the best accuracy results are achieved with good choices for each of them while the neural network architecture is not as critical as long as it is not too simple. Protocols for generating and using unbiased test, validation, and training sets are provided.

In primary oocytes of mouse quiescent primordial follicles, Golgi complexes are organized into a spherical structure, the Balbiani body. Here, we show that the structure of the B-body is maintained by microtubules and actin. The B-body stores mRNA-capping enzyme and 597 mRNAs associated with mRNA-decapping enzyme 1A. Proteins encoded by these mRNAs function in enzyme binding, cellular component organization and packing of telomere ends. Pharmacological disassembly of the B-body triggers translation of stored mRNAs and activates primordial follicles in culture and in vivo mouse model. Thus, primordial follicle quiescence is maintained by the B-body, and translationally inactive B-body-stored mRNAs may be regulated by 5-capping.",

    "abstract": "A functional vertebrate kidney relies on structural units called nephrons, which are epithelial tubules that contain a sequence of segments each expressing a distinct repertoire of solute transporters. To date, the transcriptional codes driving regional specification, solute transporter program activation, and terminal differentiation of segment populations remain poorly understood. We demonstrate for the first time that the KCTD15 paralogs, kctd15a and kctd15b, function in concert to restrict distal early (DE)/thick ascending limb (TAL) segment lineage assignment in the developing zebrafish pronephros by repressing Tfap2a activity. During renal ontogeny, expression of these factors co-localized with tfap2a in distal tubule precursors. kctd15 loss primed nephron cells to adopt distal fates by driving expansions in slc12a1, kcnj1a.1, and stc1 marker expression. These phenotypes were resultant of Tfap2a hyperactivity, where kctd15a/b-deficient embryos exhibited increased abundance of this transcription factor. Interestingly, tfap2a reciprocally promoted kctd15 transcription, unveiling a circuit of autoregulation operating in nephron progenitors. Concomitant kctd15b knockdown with tfap2a overexpression produced genetic synergy and further expanded the DE population. Our study provides strong evidence that a transcription factor-repressor feedback module employs tight regulation of Tfap2a and Kctd15 kinetics to control nephron segment fate choice and differentiation during kidney development.",

A major obstacle is, however, the problem of missing features (e.g., lack of concurrent DTI SC and resting-state fMRI FC measurements for many of the subjects).\n\nWe propose here to address the missing connectivity features problem by introducing strategies based on computational whole-brain network modeling. Using two datasets, the ADNI dataset and a healthy aging dataset, for proof-of-concept, we demonstrate the feasibility of virtual data completion (i.e., inferring \"virtual FC\" from empirical SC or \"virtual SC\" from empirical FC), by using self-consistent simulations of linear and nonlinear brain network models. Furthermore, by performing machine learning classification (to separate age classes or control from patient subjects) we show that algorithms trained on virtual connectomes achieve discrimination performance comparable to when trained on actual empirical data; similarly, algorithms trained on virtual connectomes can be used to successfully classify novel empirical connectomes. Completion algorithms can be combined and reiterated to generate realistic surrogate connectivity matrices in arbitrarily large number, opening the way to the generation of virtual connectomic datasets with network connectivity information comparable to the one of the original data.\n\nSignificance statementPersonalized information on anatomical connectivity (\"structural connectivity\", SC) or coordinated resting state activation patterns (\"functional connectivity, FC) is a source of powerful neuromarkers to detect and track the development of neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are often \"gaps\" in the available information, with only SC (or FC) being known but not FC (or SC). Exploiting whole-brain modelling, we show that gap in databases can be filled by inferring the other connectome through computational simulations. The generated virtual connectomic data carry information analogous to the one of empirical connectomes, so that machine learning algorithms can be trained on them. This opens the way to the release in the future of cohorts of \"virtual patients\", complementing traditional datasets in data-driven predictive medicine.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia and identifying early markers of this disease is important for prevention and treatment strategies. Amyloid - {beta} protein deposition is one of the earliest detectable pathological changes in AD. But in-vivo detection of amyloid - {beta} using positron emission tomography (PET) is hampered by high cost and limited geographical accessibility. These factors can become limiting when PET is used to screen large numbers of subjects into prevention trials when only a minority are expected to be amyloid- {beta} - positive. Structural MRI is advantageous; as it is relatively inexpensive and more accessible. Thus it could be widely used in large studies, even when frequent or repetitive imaging is necessary. We used a machine learning, pattern recognition, approach using intensity-based features from individual and combination of MR modalities (T1 weighted, T2 weighted, T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR], susceptibility weighted imaging) to predict voxel-level amyloid- {beta} in the brain. The MR- amyloid {beta} relation was learned within each subject and generalized across subjects using subject-specific features (demographic, clinical, and summary MR features). When compared to other modalities, combination of T1-weighted, T2-weighted FLAIR, and SWI performed best in predicting the amyloid- {beta} status as positive or negative. T2- weighted performed the best in predicting change in amyloid- {beta} over two timepoints. Overall, our results show feasibility of amyloid- {beta} prediction by MRI.",

To assess the pathogenicity of variants of unknown significance (VUSs) within BRCA2, we developed a novel method, the MANO-B method, for high-throughput functional evaluation utilizing BRCA2-deficient cells and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. The estimated sensitivity and specificity of this assay compared to those of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classification system were 95% and 95%, respectively. We classified the pathogenicity of 186 BRCA2 VUSs with our original computational pipeline, resulting in the classification of 126 mutations as \"neutral/likely neutral\", 23 as \"intermediate\", and 37 as \"deleterious/likely deleterious\". We further invented a simplified, on-demand annotation system, the Accurate BRCA Companion Diagnostic (ABCD) test, as a companion diagnostic for PARP inhibitors in patients with unknown BRCA2 VUSs. The ABCD test classification was reproducible and consistent with that of a large-scale MANO-B method.",

In recent years, as a good material for cancer liquid biopsy, plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has been widely analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) for finding new molecular markers for cancer diagnosis such as size, methylation and end coordinate. However, the current studies did not still involve esophageal cancer (ESCA), a main cancer that seriously threatens human health and life in China. Here we therefore tried to find new biomarkers for this cancer from cfDNA.\n\nMaterials & methodsThirty cfDNA samples from 26 ESCA patients and 4 healthy people were used to construct the NGS libraries and sequenced by using SALP-seq. The sequencing data were analyzed with variant bioinformatics methods for finding ESCA molecular biomarkers.\n\nResults & conclusionWe identified 103 epigenetic markers (including 54 genome-wide and 49 promoter markers) and 37 genetic markers for ESCA. These markers provide new molecular biomarkers for ESCA diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. Importantly, this study provides a new pipeline for finding new molecular markers for cancers from cfDNA by combining SALP-seq and machine learning. Finally, by finding new molecular markers for ESCA from cfDNA, this study sheds important new insights on the clinical worth of cfDNA.",

    "abstract": "Cells have evolved specialized protein disaggregases to reverse toxic protein aggregation and restore protein functionality. In nonmetazoan eukaryotes, the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp78 resolubilizes and reactivates proteins in mitochondria. Curiously, metazoa lack Hsp78. Hence, whether metazoan mitochondria reactivate aggregated proteins is unknown. Here, we establish that a mitochondrial AAA+ protein, Skd3 (human CLPB), couples ATP hydrolysis to protein disaggregation and reactivation. The Skd3 ankyrin-repeat domain combines with conserved AAA+ elements to enable stand-alone disaggregase activity. A mitochondrial inner-membrane protease, PARL, removes an autoinhibitory peptide from Skd3 to greatly enhance disaggregase activity. Indeed, PARL-activated Skd3 dissolves -synuclein fibrils connected to Parkinsons disease. Human cells lacking Skd3 exhibit reduced solubility of various mitochondrial proteins, including anti-apoptotic Hax1. Importantly, Skd3 variants linked to 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, a severe mitochondrial disorder, display diminished disaggregase activity (but not always reduced ATPase activity), which predicts disease severity. Thus, Skd3 is a potent protein disaggregase critical for human health.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common primary malignant brain tumor. The tissue microenvironment adjacent to vasculature, termed the perivascular niche, has been implicated in promoting biological processes involved in glioblastoma progression such as invasion, proliferation, and therapeutic resistance. However, the exact nature of the cues that support tumor cell aggression in this niche are largely unknown. Soluble angiocrine factors secreted by tumor-associated vasculature have been shown to support such behaviors in other cancer types. Here, we exploit macroscopic and microfluidic gelatin hydrogel platforms to profile angiocrine factors secreted by self-assembled endothelial networks and evaluate their relevance to glioblastoma biology. Aggregate angiocrine factors support increases in U87-MG cell number, migration, and therapeutic resistance to temozolomide. We also identify a novel role for TIMP1 in facilitating glioblastoma tumor cell migration. Overall, this work highlights the use of multidimensional hydrogel models to evaluate the role of angiocrine signals in glioblastoma progression.\n\nInsight, Innovation, and IntegrationGlioblastoma progression is linked to interactions between tumor and vascular cells, which can influence invasion and therapeutic response. In co-culture studies to investigate tumor-vascular crosstalk, endothelial cells often are not presented in three-dimensional structures mimicking vasculature and the exact identity of secreted factors is not explored. Here, we use tissue engineering strategies to generate three-dimensional endothelial networks from which to collect soluble angiocrine signals and assess the impact of these signals on glioblastoma behavior. Furthermore, we use secretomic analysis to identify specific factors influencing glioblastoma invasion. We identify a novel role for TIMP1 in supporting glioblastoma migration and demonstrate that soluble angiocrine signals support chemoresistance to temozolomide.",

    "abstract": "To control hand movement, we have both vision and proprioception, or position sense. The brain is known to integrate these to reduce variance. Here we ask whether older adults integrate vision and proprioception in a way that minimizes variance as young adults do, and whether older subjects compensate for an imposed visuo-proprioceptive mismatch as young adults do. Ten healthy older adults (mean age 69) and 10 healthy younger adults (mean age 19) participated. Subjects were asked to estimate the position of visual, proprioceptive, and combined targets, with no direct vision of either hand. After a veridical baseline block, a spatial visuo-proprioceptive misalignment was gradually imposed by shifting the visual component forward from the proprioceptive component without the subjects awareness. Older subjects were more variable than young subjects at estimating both visual and proprioceptive target positions (F1,18 = 6.14, p = 0.023). Older subjects tended to rely more heavily on vision than proprioception compared to younger subjects. However, the weighting of vision vs. proprioception was correlated with minimum variance predictions for both older (r = 0.71, p = 0.021) and younger (r = 0.81, p = 0.0047) adults, suggesting that variance-minimizing mechanisms are present to some degree in older adults. Visual and proprioceptive realignment were similar for young and older subjects in the misalignment block, suggesting older subjects are able to realign as much as young subjects. These results suggest that intact multisensory processing in older adults should be explored as a potential means of mitigating degradation in individual sensory systems.",

    "abstract": "Triterpene saponins (TS) are a structurally diverse group of metabolites that are widely distributed in plants. They primarily serve as defense compounds and their production is often triggered by biotic stresses through signaling cascades that are modulated by phytohormones such as the jasmonates (JA). Two JA-modulated basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs), TRITERPENE SAPONIN BIOSYNTHESIS ACTIVATING REGULATOR 1 (TSAR1) and TSAR2, have been previously identified as direct activators of TS biosynthesis in the model legume Medicago truncatula. Here, we report on the involvement of the core endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress basic leucine zipper (bZIP) TFs bZIP17 and bZIP60 in the regulation of TS biosynthesis. Expression and processing of M. truncatula bZIP17 and bZIP60 proteins was altered in roots with perturbed TS biosynthesis or treated with JA. Accordingly, such roots displayed an altered ER network structure. M. truncatula bZIP17 and bZIP60 proteins were shown to be capable of interfering with the TSAR-mediated transactivation of TS biosynthesis genes, particularly under ER stress conditions, when they translocate from the ER to the nucleus. Furthermore, the inhibitory role of ER stress bZIP TFs in the regulation of JA-dependent terpene biosynthetic pathways appears to be widespread in the plant kingdom, as we demonstrate that it also occurs in the regulation of monoterpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis in the medicinal plant Catharanthus roseus. We postulate that activation of ER stress bZIP TFs provides the plant with a mechanism to balance metabolic activities and thereby adequately govern modulation of growth, development and defense processes in defined stress situations.\n\nOne sentence summaryER stress bZIP transcription factors can interfere with the activity of jasmonate-inducible bHLH transcription factors to modulate the elicitation of plant specialized metabolism in stress conditions.",

In this work, we evaluated how network and gene expression data affect ProTINAs accuracy. Network data predominantly determines the accuracy of ProTINA instead of gene expression, while the size of an interaction network or selecting cell/tissue-specific networks have limited effects on the accuracy. However, we found that protein network betweenness values showed high accuracy in predicting drug targets. Therefore, we suggested a new algorithm, TREAP (https://github.com/ImmuSystems-Lab/TREAP), that combines betweenness values and adjusted p-values for target inference.

While this approach has been a paradigm in treating certain hematological malignancies, efforts to translate this success to solid tumors have proven challenging. In this study we show that activation of PKA drives aberrant mammary differentiation by diminishing the self-renewing potential of the basal compartment. PKA activation results in tumors that are more benign, exhibiting reduced metastatic propensity, loss of tumor-initiating potential and increased sensitivity to chemotherapy. Analysis of tumor histopathology revealed features of overt differentiation with papillary characteristics. Longitudinal single cell profiling at the hyperplasia and tumor stages uncovered an altered path of tumor evolution whereby PKA curtails the emergence of aggressive subpopulations.

This transition begs the question of whether the early enhancement in excitation might be a common driver, across etiologies, of these symptoms. We directly tested this concept by chemogenetically driving neuronal activity in neocortical neurons during postnatal days 4-14. Hyperexcitation of Emx1-, but not dopamine transporter-, parvalbumin-, or Dlx5/6-expressing neurons led to decreased social interaction and increased grooming activity in adult animals. In vivo optogenetic interrogation in adults revealed decreased baseline but increased stimulus-evoked firing rates of pyramidal neurons, impaired recruitment of inhibitory neurons and reduced cortico-striatal communication. These results directly support the prediction that changed firing in developing circuits irreversibly alters adult circuit function that leads to maladaptive changes in behaviors. This experimental approach offers a valuable platform to study the impact of disruption of developmental neural activity on the formation and function of adult neural circuits and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Impulsive behavior is a deleterious component of a number of mental health disorders but has few targeted pharmacotherapies. One contributing factor to the difficulty in understanding the neural substrates of disordered impulsivity is the diverse presentations of impulsive behavior. Defining the behavioral and cognitive processes which contribute to different subtypes of impulsivity is integral to understanding and treating disorders with dysregulated impulsive behavior. Our approach was to first determine what behavioral and cognitive phenotypes are associated with increased impulsive behavior, and then probe if they could causally contribute to increasing impulsivity. We used a mouse model for disordered impulsivity - mice lacking the serotonin 1B receptor (5-HT1BR) which have deficits specific to impulsive action, and not other components of impulsive behavior. Here we report, that in addition to increased impulsive action, mice lacking expression of 5-HT1BR also have increased goal-directed responding and motivation, with no differences in extinction, development of habitual behavior, delay discounting, or effort-based discounting. Interestingly, mice lacking 5-HT1BR expression did show an overall increase in the choice of higher value rewards, increased hedonic responses to sweet rewards, and responded more to cues that predict reward, compared to controls. We developed a novel paradigm to demonstrate that increasing anticipated reward value could directly increase impulsive action. Furthermore, we found that 5-HT1BR KO-induced impulsivity could be ameliorated by decreasing the reward value relative to controls, suggesting that the increased 5-HT1BR-associated impulsive action is a result of increased reward valuation. Taken together, these data show that the effects of serotonin on impulsive action are mediated through the modulation of hedonic value, which may alter the reward representations that motivate action. Additionally this work supports a role for reward valuation as an important substrate in impulsive action which may drive clinically-relevant increases in impulsivity.",

    "abstract": "Strigolactones (SLs) regulate important aspects of plant growth and stress responses. Many diverse types of SL occur in plants, but a complete picture of biosynthesis remains unclear. In Arabidopsis thaliana, we have demonstrated that MAX1, a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, converts carlactone (CL) into carlactonoic acid (CLA), and that LBO, a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, converts methyl carlactonoate (MeCLA) into a metabolite called [MeCLA+16] Da. In the present study, feeding experiments with deuterated MeCLAs revealed that [MeCLA+16] Da is hydroxymethyl carlactonoate (1-HO-MeCLA). Importantly, this LBO metabolite was detected in plants. Interestingly, other related compounds, methyl 4-hydroxycarlactonoate (4-HO-MeCLA) and methyl 16-hydroxycarlactonoate (16-HO-MeCLA) were also found to accumulate in lbo mutants. 3-HO-, 4-HO- and 16-HO-CL were detected in plants, but their expected corresponding metabolites, HO-CLAs, were absent in max1 mutants. These results suggest that HO-CL derivatives are predominant SLs in Arabidopsis, produced through MAX1 and LBO.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe three-dimensional genome organization is critical for gene regulation and can malfunction in diseases like cancer. As a key regulator of genome organization, CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) has been characterized as a DNA-binding protein with important functions in maintaining the topological structure of chromatin and inducing DNA looping. Among the prolific binding sites in the genome, several events with altered CTCF occupancy have been reported as associated with effects in physiology or disease. However, there is no hitherto a comprehensive survey of genome-wide CTCF binding patterns across different human cancers.\n\nResultsTo dissect functions of CTCF binding, we systematically analyze over 700 CTCF ChIP-seq profiles across human tissues and cancers and identify cancer-specific CTCF binding patterns in six cancer types. We show that cancer-specific lost and gained CTCF binding events are associated with altered chromatin interactions in patient samples, but not always with DNA methylation changes or sequence mutations. While lost bindings primarily occur near gene promoters, most gained CTCF binding events are induced by oncogenic transcription factors and exhibit enhancer activities. We validate these findings in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and show that oncogenic NOTCH1 induces specific CTCF binding and they cooperatively activate expression of target genes, indicating transcriptional condensation phenomena.\n\nConclusionsCancer-specific CTCF binding events are not always associated with DNA methylation changes or mutations, but can be induced by other transcription factors to regulate oncogenic gene expression. Our results substantiate CTCF binding alteration as a functional epigenomic signature of cancer.",
