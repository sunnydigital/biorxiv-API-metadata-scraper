    "abstract": "This study investigated the influence of illness on sexual risk behavior in adolescence and the transition to adulthood, both directly and through moderation of the impact of social disadvantage. We hypothesized positive effects for social disadvantages and illness on sexual risk behavior, consistent with the development of faster life history strategies among young people facing greater life adversity. Using the first two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we developed a mixed effects multinomial logistic regression model predicting sexual risk behavior in three comparisons, risky nonmonogamous sex vs. 1) safer nonmonogamous sex, 2) monogamous sex, and 3) abstinence, by social characteristics, illness, interactions thereof, and control covariates. Multiple imputation was used to address a modest amount of missing data. Subjects reporting higher levels of illness had lower odds of having safer nonmonogamous sex (OR = 0.84, p < .001), monogamous sex (OR = 0.82, p < .001), and abstinence (OR = 0.74, p < .001) vs. risky nonmonogamous sex, relative to individuals in better health. Illness significantly moderated the sex (OR = 0.88, p < .01), race/ethnicity (e.g., OR = 1.21, p < .001), and childhood SES (OR = 0.94; p < .01) effects for the abstinent vs. risky nonmonogamous sex comparison. Substantive findings were generally robust across waves and in various sensitivity analyses. These findings offer general support for the predictions of life history theory. Illness and various social disadvantages are associated with increased sexual risk behavior in adolescence and the transition to adulthood. Analyses indicate that the buffering effects of several protective social statuses against sexual risk-taking are substantially eroded by illness.",

    "abstract": "Cellular heterogeneity in gene expression is driven by cellular processes such as cell cycle and cell-type identity, and cellular environment such as spatial location. The cell cycle, in particular, is thought to be a key driver of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, even in otherwise homogeneous cell populations. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitate detailed characterization of gene expression heterogeneity, and can thus shed new light on the processes driving heterogeneity. Here, we combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Using these data, we developed a novel approach to characterize cell cycle progression. While standard methods assign cells to discrete cell cycle stages, our method goes beyond this, and quantifies cell cycle progression on a continuum. We found that, on average, scRNA-seq data from only five genes predicted a cells position on the cell cycle continuum to within 14% of the entire cycle, and that using more genes did not improve this accuracy. Our data and predictor of cell cycle phase can directly help future studies to account for cell-cycle-related heterogeneity in iPSCs. Our results and methods also provide a foundation for future work to characterize the effects of the cell cycle on expression heterogeneity in other cell types.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPopulation genetic approaches may be used to investigate dispersal patterns of species living in highly urbanized environment in order to improve management strategies for biodiversity conservation or pest control. However, in such environment, population genetic structure may reflect both current features of the cityscape and urbanization history. This can be especially relevant when focusing on exotic commensal rodents that have been introduced in numerous primary colonial European settlements. Accounting for spatial and temporal cityscape heterogeneity to determine how past and recent demographic events may interplay to shape current population genetic structure of synanthropic rodents may provide useful insights to manage their populations. In this study, we addressed these issues by focusing on the house mouse, Mus musculus domesticus, in Dakar, Senegal, where the species may have been introduced as soon as Europeans settled in the middle of the nineteenth century. We examined genetic variation at one mitochondrial locus and 15 nuclear microsatellite markers from individuals sampled in 14 sampling sites representing different stages of urbanization history and different socio-economic environments in Dakar. We used various approaches, including model-based genetic clustering and model-free smoothing of pairwise genetic estimates. We further linked observed spatial genetic patterns to historical and current features of Dakar cityscape using random forest and Bayesian conditional autoregressive models. Results are consistent with an introduction of the house mouse at colonial time and the current genetic structure exhibits a gradient-like pattern reflecting the historical process of spatially continuous expansion of the city from the first European settlement. The genetic patterns further suggest that population dynamics of the house mouse is also driven by the spatial heterogeneity of the current cityscape, including socio-economics features, that translate in habitat quality. Our results highlight the potential importance of accounting for past demographic events to understand spatial genetic patterns of nonnative invasive commensal rodents in highly urbanized environment.",

In contrast, direct inhibition of mitochondrial complex I, increase in intracellular calcium concentration or formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), all of which have been associated with mitochondrial stress, did not affect alpha-synuclein pathology.

Both can modify the elemental composition (i.e. stoichiometry) of primary producers and consumers. Yet their combined effect on the stoichiometry, dynamics, and stability of ecological communities remains largely unexplored. To fill this gap, we extended the Rosenzweig-MacArthur consumer-resource model by including thermal dependencies, nutrient dynamics, and stoichiometric constraints on both the primary producer and the consumer. We found that stoichiometric constraints dampen the paradox of enrichment and increased persistence at high nutrient levels. Nevertheless, they also reduced consumer persistence at extreme temperatures. Finally, we also found that stoichiometric constraints can strongly influence biomass distribution across trophic levels by modulating consumer assimilation efficiency and resource growth rates along the environmental gradients. In the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model, consumer biomass exceeded resource biomass for most parameter values whereas, in the stoichiometric model, consumer biomass was strongly reduced and sometimes lower than resource biomass. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for stoichiometric constraints as they can mediate the temperature and nutrient impact on the dynamics and functioning of ecological communities.",

    "abstract": "Although the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung microbiome has been characterized in several studies, little is still known about the functions harboured by those bacteria, and how they change with disease status and antibiotic treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate the taxonomic and functional temporal dynamics of airways microbiome in a cohort of CF patients. Multiple sputum samples were collected over 15 months from 22 patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection, for a total of 79 samples. DNA extracted from samples was subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing allowing either strain-level taxonomic profiling and assessment of the functional metagenomic repertoire. High inter-patient taxonomic heterogeneity was found with short-term compositional changes during exacerbations and following antibiotic treatment. Each patient exhibited distinct sputum microbial communities at the taxonomic level, and strain-specific colonization of traditional CF pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, and emerging pathogens. Sputum microbiome was found to be extraordinarily resilient following antibiotic treatment, with rapid recovery of taxa and metagenome-associated gene functions. In particular, a large core set of genes, including antibiotic resistance genes, were shared across patients despite observed differences in clinical status or antibiotic treatment, and constantly detected in the lung microbiome of all subjects independently from known antibiotic exposure, suggesting an overall microbiome-associated functions stability despite taxonomic fluctuations of the communities.\n\nIMPORTANCEWhile the dynamics of CF sputum microbial composition were highly patient-specific, the overall sputum metagenome composition was stable, showing a high resilience along time and antibiotic exposure. The high degree of redundancy in the CF lung microbiome could testifies ecological aspects connected to the disease that were never considered so far, as the large core-set of genes shared between patients despite observed differences in clinical status or antibiotic treatment. Investigations on the actual functionality (e.g. by metatranscriptomics) of the identified core-set of genes could provide clues on genetic function of the microbiome to be targeted in future therapeutic treatments.",

    "abstract": "The metabolic responses of bacteria to dynamic extracellular conditions drives not only the behavior of single species, but also entire communities of microbes. Over the last decade, genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions have assisted in our appreciation of important metabolic determinants of bacterial physiology. These network models have been a powerful force in understanding the metabolic capacity that species may utilize in order to succeed in an environment. Increasingly, an understanding of context-specific metabolism is critical for elucidating metabolic drivers of larger phenotypes and disease. However, previous approaches to use network models in concert with omics data to better characterize experimental systems have met challenges due to assumptions necessary by the various integration platforms or due to large input data requirements. With these challenges in mind, we developed RIPTiDe (Reaction Inclusion by Parsimony and Transcript Distribution) which uses both transcriptomic abundances and parsimony of overall flux to identify the most cost-effective usage of metabolism that also best reflects the cells investments into transcription. Additionally, in biological samples where it is difficult to quantify specific growth conditions, it becomes critical to develop methods that require lower amounts of user intervention in order to generate accurate metabolic predictions. Utilizing a metabolic network reconstruction for the model organism Escherichia coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 (iJO1366), we found that RIPTiDe correctly identifies context-specific metabolic pathway activity without supervision or knowledge of specific media conditions. We also assessed the application of RIPTiDe to in vivo metatranscriptomic data where E. coli was present at high abundances, and found that our approach also effectively predicts metabolic behaviors of host-associated bacteria. In the setting of human health, understanding metabolic changes within bacteria in environments where growth substrate availability is difficult to quantify can have large downstream impacts on our ability to elucidate molecular drivers of disease-associated dysbiosis across the microbiota. Our results indicate that RIPTiDe may have potential to provide understanding of context-specific metabolism of bacteria within complex communities.\n\nAuthor SummaryTranscriptomic analyses of bacteria have become instrumental to our understanding of their responses to changes in their environment. While traditional analyses have been informative, leveraging these datasets within genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) can provide greatly improved context for shifts in pathway utilization and downstream/upstream ramifications for changes in metabolic regulation. Many previous techniques for GENRE transcript integration have focused on creating maximum consensus with input datasets, but these approaches were recently shown to generate less accurate metabolic predictions than a transcript-agnostic method of flux minimization (pFBA), which identifies the most efficient/economic patterns of metabolism given certain growth constraints. Despite this success, growth conditions are not always easily quantifiable and highlights the need for novel platforms that build from these findings. Our new method, RIPTiDe, combines these concepts and utilizes overall minimization of flux weighted by transcriptomic analysis to identify the most energy efficient pathways to achieve growth that include more highly transcribed enzymes, without previous insight into extracellular conditions. Utilizing a well-studied GENRE from Escherichia coli, we demonstrate that this new approach correctly predicts patterns of metabolism utilizing a variety of both in vitro and in vivo transcriptomes. This platform could be important for revealing context-specific bacterial phenotypes in line with governing principles of adaptive evolution, that drive disease manifestation or interactions between microbes.",

The structure presents two metastable conformations separated by a free energy barrier that is lowered upon omission of four specific DNA staples (defect). In contrast, only one stable conformation is present upon removing eight staples. The metastability is explained in terms of the intrinsic conformations of the three trapezoidal substructures. We computationally modeled the local accessibility to endonucleases, to predict the reactivity of twenty sites, and found good agreement with the experimental data. We showed that global fluctuations affect local reactivity: the removal of the DNA staples increased the computed accessibility to a restriction enzyme, at sites as distant as 40nm, due to an increase in global fluctuation.

Pyramidal cells (PCs) in hippocampal CA3 are necessary for rapid memory encoding, preferentially occurring during exploratory behavior in the high-arousal theta state. However, the relationship between the membrane potential dynamics of CA3 PCs and theta has not been explored. Here, we characterize the changes in the membrane potential of PCs in relation to theta using electrophysiological recordings in awake mice. During theta, most PCs behave in a stereotypical manner, consistently hyperpolarizing time-locked to the duration of theta. Additionally, PCs display lower membrane potential variance and reduced firing rate. In contrast, during large irregular activity, a low-arousal state, PCs show heterogeneous changes in membrane potential. This suggests coordinated hyperpolarization of PCs during theta, possibly caused by increased inhibition. This could lead to higher signal-to-noise ratio in the small population of PCs active during theta as observed in ensemble recordings.",

Yet, almost no artificial FDA-approved products are commercially available today - three decades after the inception of tissue engineering. It is hypothesized here that the major bottlenecks restricting its progress stem from lack of access to the inner pore space of the scaffolds. Specifically, the inability to deliver nutrients to, and clear waste from, the center of the scaffolds limits the size of the products that can be cultured. Likewise, the inability to monitor, and control, the cells after seeding them into the scaffold results in nonviable tissue, with an unacceptable product variability. To resolve these bottlenecks, we present a prototype addressable microfluidics device capable of minimally disruptive fluid and cell manipulations within living cultures. As proof-of-concept, we demonstrate its ability to perform additive manufacturing by seeding cells in spatial patterns (including co-culturing multiple cell types); and subtractive manufacturing by removing surface adherent cells via focused flow of trypsin. Additionally, we show that the device can sample fluids and perform cell \"biopsies\" (which can be subsequently sent for ex-situ analysis), from any location within its Culture Chamber. Finally, the on-chip plumbing is completely automated using external electronics. This opens the possibility to perform long-term computer-driven tissue engineering experiments, where the cell behavior is modulated in response to the minimally disruptive observations (e.g. fluid sampling and cell biopsies) throughout the entire duration of the cultures. It is expected that the proof-of-concept technology will eventually be scaled up to 3D addressable microfluidic scaffolds, capable of overcoming the limitations bottlenecking the transition of tissue engineering technologies to the clinical setting.",

Liquid-liquid phase separation and coacervation have recently been shown to play an important role in the organization of biological systems. Such systems are highly dynamic and under continuous influence of enzymatic and chemical processes. However, it is still unclear how enzymatic and chemical reactions affect the coacervation process. Here, we present and characterize a system of enzymatically active coacervates containing spermine, RNA, free nucleotides, and the template independent RNA (de)polymerase PNPase. We find that these RNA coacervates display transient non-spherical shapes, and we systematically study how PNPase concentration, UDP concentration and temperature affect coacervate morphology. Furthermore, we show that PNPase localizes predominantly into the coacervate phase and that its depolymerization activity in high-phosphate buffer causes coacervate degradation. Our observations of non-spherical coacervate shapes may have broader implications for the relationship between (bio-)chemical activity and coacervate biology.",

    "abstract": "We develop a visuomotor model that implements visual search as a focal accuracy-seeking policy, with the targets position and category drawn independently from a common generative process. Consistently with the anatomical separation between the ventral versus dorsal pathways, the model is composed of two pathways, that respectively infer what to see and where to look. The \"What\" network is a classical deep learning classifier, that only processes a small region around the center of fixation, providing a \"foveal\" accuracy. In contrast, the \"Where\" network processes the full visual field in a biomimetic fashion, using a log-polar retinotopic encoding, which is preserved up to the action selection level. The foveal accuracy is used to train the \"Where\" network. After training, the \"Where\" network provides an \"accuracy map\" that serves to guide the eye toward peripheral objects. The comparison of both networks accuracies amounts to either select a saccade or to keep the eye at the center to identify the target. We test this setup on a simple task of finding a digit in a large, cluttered image. Our simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, increasing by one order of magnitude the radius of the visual field toward which the agent can detect and recognize a target, either through a single saccade or with multiple ones. Importantly, our log-polar treatment of the visual information exploits the strong compression rate performed at the sensory level, providing ways to implement visual search in a sub-linear fashion, in contrast with mainstream computer vision.",

    "abstract": "The full potential of managing microbial communities to support plant health is yet-unrealized, in part because it remains difficult to ascertain which members are most important for the plant. However, microbes that consistently associate with a plant species across varied field conditions and over plant development likely engage with the host or host environment. Here, we applied abundance-occupancy concepts from macroecology to quantify the core membership of bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities in the rhizosphere of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). Our study investigated the microbiome membership that persisted over multiple dimensions important for plant agriculture, including major growing regions, plant development, annual plantings, and divergent genotypes, and also included re-analysis of public data. We found 48 core bacterial taxa that were consistently detected in all samples, inclusive of all datasets and dimensions. This suggests reliable enrichment of these taxa to the plant environment and time-independence of their association with the plant. More generally, this work provides a robust approach for systematically prioritizing core microbiome memberships in any host or system.",

Regardless of experimental aims, fitness assays are a central component of this type of research, and low-throughput often limits the scope and complexity of experimental evolution studies. We created an experimental evolution system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that utilizes genetic barcoding to overcome this challenge.\n\nResultsWe first confirm that barcode insertions do not alter fitness and that barcode sequencing can be used to efficiently detect fitness differences via pooled competition-based fitness assays. Next, we examine the effects of ploidy, chemical stress, and population bottleneck size on the evolutionary dynamics and fitness gains (adaptation) in a total of 76 experimentally evolving, asexual populations by conducting 1,216 fitness assays and analyzing 532 longitudinal-evolutionary samples collected from the evolving populations. In our analysis of these data we describe the strengths of this experimental evolution system and explore sources of error in our measurements of fitness and evolutionary dynamics.\n\nConclusionsOur experimental treatments generated distinct fitness effects and evolutionary dynamics, respectively quantified via multiplexed fitness assays and barcode lineage tracking. These findings demonstrate the utility of this new resource for designing and improving high-throughput studies of experimental evolution. The approach described here provides a framework for future studies employing experimental designs that require high-throughput multiplexed fitness measurements.",

    "abstract": "Suicidal behaviors are strongly linked with mood disorders, but the specific neurobiological and functional gene-expression correlates for this linkage remain elusive. We performed neuroimaging-guided RNA-sequencing in two studies to test the hypothesis that imaging-localized gray matter volume (GMV) loss in mood disorders, harbors gene-expression changes associated with disease morbidity and related suicide mortality in an independent postmortem cohort. To do so, first, we conducted study 1 using an anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) MRI meta-analysis including a total of 47 voxel-based morphometry (VBM) publications (i.e. 26 control>major depressive disorder (MDD) studies, and 21 control>bipolar disorder (BD) studies) in 2387 (living) participants. Study 1 meta-analysis identified a selective anterior insula cortex (AIC) GMV loss in mood disorders. We then used this results to guide study 2 postmortem tissue dissection and RNA-Sequencing of 100 independent donor brain samples with a life-time history of MDD (N=30), BD (N=37) and control (N=33). In study 2, exploratory factor-analysis identified a higher-order factor representing number of Axis-1 diagnoses (e.g. substance use disorders/psychosis/anxiety, etc.), referred to here as morbidity and suicide-completion referred to as mortality. Comparisons of case-vs-control, and factor-analysis defined higher-order-factor contrast variables revealed that the imaging-identified AIC GMV loss sub-region harbors differential gene-expression changes in high morbidity-&-mortality versus low morbidity-&-mortality cohorts in immune, inflammasome, and neurodevelopmental pathways. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis further identified co-activated gene modules for psychiatric morbidity and mortality outcomes. These results provide evidence that AIC anatomical signature for mood disorders are possible correlates for gene-expression abnormalities in mood morbidity and suicide mortality.",

    "abstract": "Many systems in biology and beyond employ collaborative, collective communication strategies for improved efficiency and adaptive benefit. One such paradigm of particular interest is the community estimation of a dynamic signal, when, for example, an epithelial tissue of cells must decide whether to react to a given dynamic external concentration of stress signaling molecules. At the level of dynamic cellular communication, however, it remains unknown what effect, if any, arises from communication beyond the mean field level. What are the limits and benefits to communication across a network of neighbor interactions? What is the role of Poissonian vs. super Poissonian dynamics in such a setting? How does the particular topology of connections impact the collective estimation and that of the individual participating cells? In this letter we construct a robust and general framework of signal estimation over continuous time Markov chains in order to address and answer these questions. Our results show that in the case of Possonian estimators, the communication solely enhances convergence speed of the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of the estimators to their steady-state values while leaving these values unchanged. However, in the super-Poissonian regime, MSE of estimators significantly decreases by increasing the number of neighbors. Surprisingly, in this case, the clustering coefficient of an estimator does not enhance its MSE while reducing total MSE of the population.",

While ecologists have long studied food webs of feeding interactions, recent studies increasingly focus on mutualistic networks including plants that exchange food for reproductive services provided by animals such as pollinators. Here, we synthesize both types of consumer-resource interactions to better understand the controversial effects of mutualism on ecosystems at the species, guild, and whole-community levels. We find that consumer-resource mechanisms underlying plant-pollinator mutualisms can increase the persistence, productivity, abundance, and temporal stability of both mutualists and non-mutualists in food webs. These effects strongly increase with floral reward productivity and are qualitatively robust to variation in the prevalence of mutualism and pollinators feeding upon resources in addition to rewards. This work advances the ability of mechanistic network theory to synthesize different types of interactions and illustrates how mutualism can enhance the diversity, stability, and function of complex ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual spatial suppression is a phenomenon in which the perceived strength of a stimulus in some region of the space is reduced when the stimulus is surrounded by other stimuli. For contrast perception, several studies suggest that spatial suppression is reduced in patients with schizophrenia. For motion perception, only one study has been conducted in a cohort of 16 patients, suggesting that spatial suppression is reduced. It is unknown, however, whether this reduction is related to the lower IQ that schizophrenic patients usually show; as there is evidence that spatial suppression for motion increases with IQ in healthy individuals. Here, we sought to determine the spatial suppression for motion in a larger cohort of 33 patients with schizophrenia controlling for IQ. We found a weakened spatial suppression in patients with schizophrenia, consistent with the previous study (g = 0.47, CI = [0.055, 0.88], combining the previous and our study). For comparison, we performed a meta-analysis on spatial suppression for contrast and found a similar effect size. We found that patients had a lower IQ than controls, but this difference did not explain their weaker spatial suppression. Further, we found that spatial suppression of patients, but not controls increased with their IQ and decreased with age in both groups. Finally, as we estimated lapses of attention, we could estimate motion sensitivity and found that it was decreased in patients. We speculate about possible alterations in neurotransmission that might explain the reduced spatial suppression and sensitivity that we found.",

Using ribosome profiling of the hippocampus, we find that ribosome footprint levels in Fmr1-deficient tissue mostly reflect changes in RNA abundance. Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wildtype tissue reveals a wide range of ribosome translocation rates; on many mRNAs, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that FMRP co-sediments with stalled ribosomes; and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs. One such mRNA encodes SETD2, a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K36me3. ChIP-Seq demonstrates that loss of FMRP alters the deployment of this epigenetic mark on chromatin. H3K36me3 is associated with alternative pre-RNA processing, which we find occurs in an FMRP-dependent manner on transcripts linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders.\n\nHighlights- Loss of FMRP results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs (eg., SETD2)\n- Increased SETD2 protein levels alter H3K36me3 marks in FMRP deficient hippocampus\n- Genome-wide changes in mRNA alternative splicing occur in FMRP deficient hippocampus\n- H3K36me3 marks and alternative splicing changes occur on transcripts linked to autism",

While receiving tonic cold pain, 20 healthy participants were asked to utilise three different pain attenuation strategies.

We related the trial-by-trial variability of the attenuation performance to the trial-by-trial functional connectivity of the cortical data.\n\nAcross all conditions, we found that a higher performance of pain attenuation was predominantly associated with higher functional connectivity. Of note, we observed an association between low pain and high connectivity for regions that belong to the core areas of pain processing, i.e. the insular and cingulate cortices. For one of the cognitive strategies (safe place), the performance of pain attenuation was explained by diffusion tensor imaging metrics of increased white matter integrity.\n\nImpact StatementIn a single trial analysis, the more effective attempts to attenuate pain in three different conditions are associated with general higher functional connectivity across the entire brain.",

    "abstract": "It has been hypothesized that the central nervous system simplifies the production of movement by limiting motor commands to a small set of modules known as muscle synergies. Recently, investigators have questioned whether a low-dimensional controller can produce the rich and flexible behaviors seen in everyday movements. To study this issue, we implemented muscle synergies in a biomechanically realistic model of the human upper extremity and performed computational experiments to determine whether synergies introduced task performance deficits, facilitated the learning of movements, and generalized to different movements. We derived sets of synergies from the muscle excitations our dynamic optimizations computed for a nominal task (reaching in a plane). Then we compared the performance and learning rates of a controller that activated all muscles independently to controllers that activated the synergies derived from the nominal reaching task. We found that a controller based on synergies had errors within 1 cm of a full-dimensional controller and achieved faster learning rates (as estimated from computational time to converge). The synergy-based controllers could also accomplish new tasks-such as reaching to targets on a higher or lower plane, and starting from alternate initial poses-with average errors similar to a full-dimensional controller.",

    "abstract": "Interspecific hybridization and allopolyploidization merges evolutionarily distinct parental genomes (subgenomes) into a single nucleus. A frequent observation is that one subgenome is \"dominant\" over the other subgenome, having a greater number of reatined duplicate genes and being more highly expressed. Which subgenome becomes dominantly expressed in allopolyploids remains poorly understood. Here we \"replayed the evolutionary tape\" with six isogenic resynthesized Brassica napus (rapeseed) allopolyploid lines and investigated subgenome dominance patterns over the first ten generations. We found that the same subgenome was consistently more dominantly expressed in all lines and generations. Furthermore, DNA methylation differences between subgenomes mirrored the observed gene expression bias towards the Brassica oleracea derived  C subgenome in all lines and generations. These differences in gene expression and methylation were also found when comparing the progenitor genomes, suggesting subgenome dominance is related to inherited parental genome differences rather than a byproduct of allopolyploidization. Gene network analyses indicated an enrichment for network interactions and several biological functions for  C subgenome biased pairs, but no enrichment was observed for  A subgenome biased pairs. These findings demonstrate that \"replaying the evolutionary tape\" in allopolyploids results in repeatable and predictable subgenome expression dominance patterns based on preexisting genetic differences among the parental species. These findings have major implications regarding the genotypic and phenotypic diversity observed following plant hybridization in both ecological and agricultural contexts.",

We extracted and sequenced DNA from the blood stain and also from another section of the newspaper, which we used for comparison. Results from the human DNA sequence analyses were compatible with a heterogeneous ancestry of Marat, with his mother being of French origin and his father born in Sardinia. Metagenomic analyses of the non-human reads uncovered the presence of fungal, bacterial and low levels of viral DNA. Relying on the presence/absence of microbial species in the samples, we could cast doubt on several putative infectious agents that have been previously hypothesised as the cause of his condition but for which we detect not a single sequencing read. Conversely, some of the species we detect are uncommon as environmental contaminants and may represent plausible infective agents.

This is largely because of the paucity of detailed free-flight kinematic data, but also because analytical limitations in existing blade element models mean that they cannot incorporate the complex three-dimensional movements of the wings and body that occur during insect flight. Here, we present a blade element model with empirically-fitted aerodynamic force coefficients that incorporates the full three-dimensional wing kinematics of manoeuvring Eristalis hoverflies, including torsional deformation of their wings. The two free parameters were fitted to a large free-flight dataset comprising N = 26, 541 wingbeats, and the fitted model captured approximately 80% of the variation in the stroke-averaged forces in the sagittal plane. We tested the robustness of the model by subsampling the data, and found little variation in the parameter estimates across subsamples comprising 10% of the flight sequences. The simplicity and generality of the model that we present is such that it can be readily applied to kinematic datasets from other insects, and also used for the study of insect flight dynamics.",

Whilst the gels deformed and/or swelled over time in some commonly used solutions, this was overcome by using a previously described custom refractive index matched solution. To validate their use, CUBIC cleared mouse tissues and whole embryos were embedded in hydrogels, stained using fluorescent small molecule dyes, labels and antibodies and successfully imaged using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. In conclusion, the high-water content, high refractive index hydrogels described in this study have a broad applicability to research that delves into pathophysiological processes by stabilising and protecting large and fragile samples.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThere are important molecular information hidden in the ocean of big data could be achieved by recognizing true relationships between different molecules. Human mind is very limited to find all molecular connections. Therefore, we introduced an integrated data mining strategy to find all possible relationships between molecular components in a biological context. To demonstrate how this approach works, we applied it on proto-oncogene c-Src.\n\nResultsHere we applied a data mining scheme on genomic, literature and signaling databases to obtain necessary biological information for pathway inference. Using R programming language, two large edgelists were constructed from KEGG and OmniPath signaling databases. Next, An R script was developed by which pathways were discovered by assembly of edge information in the constructed signaling networks. Then, valid pathways were distinguished from the invalid ones using molecular information in articles and genomic data analysis. Pathway inference was performed on predicted pathways starting with Src and ending with the DEGs whose expression were affected by c-Src overactivation. Moreover, some positive and negative feedback loops were proposed based on the gene expression results. In fact, this simple but practical flowchart will open new insights into interactions between cellular components and help biologists look for new possible molecular relationships that have not been reported neither in signaling databases nor as a signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the major causes of cancer deaths across the world. Patients survival time at time of diagnosis depends largely on stage of the tumor. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms promoting cancer progression from early stages to high-grade stages is essential for implementing therapeutic approaches. To this end, we performed a unique meta-analysis flowchart by identifying differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between normal, primary and metastatic samples in some test datasets. DEGs were employed to construct a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Then, a smaller network containing 39 DEGs were extracted from the PPI network whose nodes expression induction or suppression alone or in combination with each other would inhibit tumor progression or metastasis. A number of these DEGs were then verified by gene expression profiling, survival analysis and a number of validation datasets from different genomic repositories. They were involved in cell proliferation, energy production under hypoxic conditions, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. Multiple combination targeting of these DEGs were proposed to have high potential in preventing cancer progression. Some genes were also presented as diagnostic biomarkers for colorectal cancer. Finally, TMEM131, DARS and SORD genes were identified in this study which had never been associated with any kind of cancer neither as a biomarker nor curative target.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAfter mating, female mosquitoes need animal blood to develop their eggs. In the process of acquiring blood, they may acquire pathogens, which may cause different diseases to humans such as malaria, zika, dengue, and chikungunya. Therefore, knowing the parity status of mosquitoes is useful in control and evaluation of infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, where parous mosquitoes are assumed to be potentially infectious. Ovary dissections, which currently are used to determine the parity status of mosquitoes, are very tedious and limited to very few experts. An alternative to ovary dissections is near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), which can estimate the age in days and the infectious state of laboratory and semi-field reared mosquitoes with accuracies between 80 and 99%. No study has tested the accuracy of NIRS for estimating the parity status of wild mosquitoes.\n\nMethods and resultsIn this study, we train artificial neural network (ANN) models on NIR spectra to estimate the parity status of wild mosquitoes. We use four different datasets: An. arabiensis collected from Minepa, Tanzania (Minepa-ARA); An. gambiae collected from Muleba, Tanzania (Muleba-GA); An. gambiae collected from Burkina Faso (Burkina-GA); and An.gambiae from Muleba and Burkina Faso combined (Muleba-Burkina-GA). We train ANN models on datasets with spectra preprocessed according to previous protocols. We then use autoencoders to reduce the spectra feature dimensions from 1851 to 10 and re-train ANN models. Before the autoencoder was applied, ANN models estimated parity status of mosquitoes in Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA and Muleba-Burkina-GA with out-of-sample accuracies of 81.9 {+/-} 2.8% (N=927), 68.7 {+/-} 4.8% (N=140), 80.3 {+/-} 2.0% (N=158), and 75.7 {+/-} 2.5% (N=298), respectively. With the autoencoder, ANN models tested on out-of-sample data achieved 97.1 {+/-} 2.2%, (N=927), 89.8 {+/-} 1.7% (N=140), 93.3 {+/-} 1.2% (N=158), and 92.7 {+/-} 1.8% (N=298) accuracies for Minepa-ARA, Muleba-GA, Burkina-GA, and Muleba-Burkina-GA, respectively.\n\nConclusionThese results show that a combination of an autoencoder and an ANN trained on NIR spectra to estimate parity status of wild mosquitoes yields models that can be used as an alternative tool to estimate parity status of wild mosquitoes, especially since NIRS is a high-throughput, reagent-free, and simple-to-use technique compared to ovary dissections.",

To unravel their connection, thorough transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional characterization was performed from umbilical cord blood (CB). Unexpectedly, ILC1-like cells lacked Tbet expression and failed to produce IFNg. Moreover, in contrast to previously described ILC1 subsets they could be efficiently differentiated into NK cells. These were characterized by highly diversified KIR repertoires including late stage NKG2A-KIR+ effector cells that are commonly not generated from previously known NK cell progenitor sources. This property was dependent on stroma cell-derived Notch ligands. The frequency of the novel ILC1-like NK cell progenitor (NKP) significantly declined in CB from early to late gestational age. The study supports a model in which circulating fetal ILC1-like NKPs travel to secondary lymphoid tissues to initiate the formation of diversified NK cell repertoires after birth.",

Current treatment regimens are prolonged and costly, and acquired antimicrobial resistance has been reported for all currently used antibiotics.\n\nObjectivesEfforts to develop new treatments for melioidosis are hampered by the risks associated with handling pathogenic B. pseudomallei, which restricts research to facilities with Biosafety Level (BSL) 3 containment. Closely related Burkholderia species that are less pathogenic can be investigated under less stringent BSL 2 containment. We hypothesized that near-neighbour Burkholderia species could be used as model organisms for developing therapies that would also be effective against B. pseudomallei.\n\nMethodsWe used microbroth dilution assays to compare the susceptibility of three Australian B. pseudomallei isolates and five near-neighbour Burkholderia species - B. humptydooensis, B. thailandensis, B. oklahomensis, B territorii and B. stagnalis - to antibiotics currently used to treat melioidosis, and general-use antibacterial agents. We also established the susceptibility profiles of B. humptydooensis and B. territorii to 400 compounds from the Medicines for Malaria Venture Pathogen Box.\n\nResultsFrom these comparisons, we observed a high degree of similarity in the susceptibility profiles of B. pseudomallei and near-neighbour species B. humptydooensis, B. thailandensis, B. oklahomensis and B. territorii.\n\nConclusionsLess pathogenic Australian Burkholderia species B. humptydooensis, B. thailandensis, B. oklahomensis and B. territorii are excellent model organisms for developing potential new therapies for melioidosis.",

However, these models have hardly been linked to the ill-understood neurobiological changes that occur in the aging auditory cortex. Modelling the hemodynamic response to a rich natural sound mixture in N=64 listeners of varying age, we here show that in older listeners auditory cortex, the key feature of temporal rate is represented with a markedly broader tuning. This loss of temporal selectivity is most prominent in primary auditory cortex and planum temporale, with no such changes in adjacent auditory or other brain areas. Amongst older listeners, we observe a direct relationship between chronological age and temporal-rate tuning, unconfounded by auditory acuity or model goodness of fit.

    "abstract": "Diffusion MRI tractography is commonly used to delineate white matter tracts. These delineations can be used for planning neurosurgery or for identifying regions of interest from which microstructural measurements can be taken. Probabilistic tractography produces different delineations each time it is run, potentially leading to microstructural measurements or anatomical delineations that are not reproducible. Generating a sufficiently large number of streamlines is required to avoid this scenario, but what constitutes \"sufficient\" is difficult to assess and so streamline counts are typically chosen in an arbitrary or qualitative manner. This work explores several factors influencing tractography reliability and details two methods for estimating this reliability. The first method automatically estimates the number of streamlines required to achieve reliable microstructural measurements, whilst the second estimates the number of streamlines required to achieve a reliable binarised trackmap than can be used clinically. Using these methods, we calculated the number of streamlines required to achieve a range of quantitative reproducibility criteria for three anatomical tracts in 40 Human Connectome Project datasets. Actual reproducibility was checked by repeatedly generating the tractograms with the calculated numbers of streamlines. We found that the required number of streamlines varied strongly by anatomical tract, image resolution, number of diffusion directions, the degree of reliability desired, the microstructural measurement of interest, and/or the specifics on how the tractogram was converted to a binary volume. The proposed methods consistently predicted streamline counts that achieved the target reproducibility. Implementations are made available to enable the scientific community to more-easily achieve reproducible tractography.",

    "abstract": "A growing number of empirical studies have quantified the degree to which evolution is geometrically parallel, by estimating and interpreting pairwise angles between evolutionary change vectors in multiple replicate lineages. Similar comparisons, of distance in trait space, are used to assess the degree of convergence. These approaches amount to element-by-element interpretation of distance matrices, and can fail to capture the true extent of multivariate parallelism when evolution involves multiple traits sampled across multiple lineages. We suggest an alternative set of approaches, co-opted from evolutionary quantitative genetics, involving eigen analysis and comparison of among-lineage covariance matrices. Such approaches not only allow the full extent of multivariate parallelism to be revealed and interpreted, but also allow for the definition of biologically tenable null hypotheses against which empirical patterns can be tested. Reanalysis of a dataset of multivariate evolution across a replicated lake/stream gradient in threespine stickleback reveals that most of the variation in the direction of evolutionary change can be captured in just a few dimensions, indicating a greater extent of parallelism than previously appreciated. We suggest that applying such multivariate approaches may often be necessary to fully understand the extent and form of parallel and convergent evolution.",

    "abstract": "The Ewing family of sarcomas comprises the fourth most common highly aggressive bone tumor. Four of five Ewing sarcoma chemotherapeutics induce DNA damage, as does radiation therapy. At relapse, two additional DNA-damaging agents are routinely used to re-induce remission, indicating that Ewing sarcoma is intrinsically sensitive to DNA damage. However, current treatment regimens are relatively ineffective, specifically for relapsed or metastatic disease. Several preclinical studies, including our study in the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP), provide evidence for the synthetic lethal combination of PARP1 inhibitor talazoparib with a DNA-methylating agent, temozolomide, for Ewing sarcoma. Nevertheless, in both preclinical studies and clinical trials, doses of temozolomide were significantly reduced because of toxicity of the drug combination. Temozolomide-induced DNA lesions are repaired via poly(ADP) ribose polymerase I (PARP1)-dependent base excision repair and by O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in a single-step adduct removal. Here, we provide evidence that the two DNA repair pathways act in an epistatic manner in lesion removal. Further, we demonstrate that PARP1 and MGMT physically interact, and that this association is stimulated upon DNA damage. Protein co-immunoprecipitation and microscale thermophoresis analyses revealed that PARP1/MGMT complex formation is DNA and PARylation-independent. Collectively, our results show that: 1) DNA damage response pathways mediated by PARP1 and MGMT work epistatically to eliminate temozolomide-induced DNA adducts; 2) PARP1 and MGMT physically interact; and 3) PARP1/MGMT interaction is increased in response to DNA damage. We discuss how our findings may affect therapeutic advancement for Ewing sarcoma and potentially other cancer types.",

    "abstract": "C. elegans is exposed to many different bacteria in its environment, and must distinguish pathogenic from nutritious bacterial food sources. Here, we show that a single exposure to purified small RNAs isolated from pathogenic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) is sufficient to induce pathogen avoidance, both in the treated animals and in four subsequent generations of progeny. The RNA interference and piRNA pathways, the germline, and the ASI neuron are required for bacterial small RNA-induced avoidance behavior and transgenerational inheritance. A single non-coding RNA, P11, is both necessary and sufficient to convey learned avoidance of PA14, and its C. elegans target, maco-1, is required for avoidance. A natural microbiome Pseudomonas isolate, GRb0427, can induce avoidance via its small RNAs, and the wild C. elegans strain JU1580 responds similarly to bacterial sRNA. Our results suggest that this ncRNA-dependent mechanism evolved to survey the worms microbial environment, use this information to make appropriate behavioral decisions, and pass this information on to its progeny.",

    "abstract": "New therapies are necessary to combat increasingly antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. We have developed a technology platform of computational, molecular biology, and microbiology tools which together enable on-demand production of phages that target virtually any given bacterial isolate. Two complementary computational tools that identify and precisely map prophages and other integrative genetic elements (IGEs) in bacterial genomes are used to identify prophage-laden bacteria that are close relatives of the target strain. Phage genomes are engineered to disable lysogeny, through use of long amplicon PCR and Gibson assembly. Finally, the engineered phage genomes are introduced into host bacteria for phage production. As an initial demonstration, we used this approach to produce a phage cocktail against the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Two prophage-laden P. aeruginosa strains closely related to PAO1 were identified, ATCC 39324 and ATCC 27853. Deep sequencing revealed that mitomycin C treatment of these strains induced seven phages that grow on P. aeruginosa PAO1. The most diverse five of these were engineered for non-lysogeny by deleting the integrase gene (int), which is readily identifiable and typically conveniently located at one end of the prophage. The {Delta}int phages, individually and in cocktails, showed killing of P. aeruginosa PAO1 in vitro as well as in a waxworm (Galleria mellonella) model of infection.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe antibiotic-resistance crisis in medicine and agriculture has led to renewed interest in phage therapy as an alternative means of treating infection. However, conventional methods for isolating pathogen-specific phage are slow, labor-intensive, and frequently unsuccessful. We have demonstrated that prophages carried by near-neighbor bacteria can serve as starting material for production of engineered phages that kill the target pathogen. Our approach and technology platform offer new opportunity for rapid development of phage therapies against most, if not all, bacterial pathogens, a foundational advance for use of phage in treating infectious disease.",

    "abstract": "The pulvinar is a higher-order thalamic relay and a central component of the extrageniculate visual pathway, with input from the superior colliculus and visual cortex and output to all of visual cortex. Rodent pulvinar, more commonly called the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), consists of three highly-conserved subdivisions, and offers the advantage of simplicity in its study compared to more subdivided primate pulvinar. Little is known about receptive field properties of LP, let alone whether functional differences exist between different LP subdivisions, making it difficult to understand what visual information is relayed and what kinds of computations the pulvinar might support. Here, we characterized single-cell response properties in two V1 recipient subdivisions of rat pulvinar, the rostromedial (LPrm) and lateral (LPl), and found that a fourth of the cells were selective for orientation, compared to half in V1, and that LP tuning widths were significantly broader. Response latencies were also significantly longer and preferred size more than three times larger on average than in V1; the latter suggesting pulvinar as a source of spatial context to V1. Between subdivisons, LPl cells preferred higher temporal frequencies, whereas LPrm showed a greater degree of direction selectivity and pattern motion detection. Taken together with known differences in connectivity patterns, these results suggest two separate visual feature processing channels in the pulvinar, one in LPl related to higher speed processing which likely derives from superior colliculus input, and the other in LPrm for motion processing derived through input from visual cortex.\n\nSignificance StatementThe pulvinar has a perplexing role in visual cognition as no clear link has been found between the functional properties of its neurons and behavioral deficits that arise when it is damaged. The pulvinar, called the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) in rats, is a higher order thalamic relay with input from the superior colliculus and visual cortex and output to all of visual cortex. By characterizing single-cell response properties in anatomically distinct subdivisions we found two separate visual feature processing channels in the pulvinar, one in lateral LP related to higher speed processing which likely derives from superior colliculus input, and the other in rostromedial LP for motion processing derived through input from visual cortex.",

We here discover that DCT peptides opposedly mediate these two sets of transcription signals, all tunable in accordance to C-terminus mediated inhibition (CMI) of Ca2+/CaV1 influx. By electrophysiology, neurite morphology, and FRET 2-hybrid binding analyses, we systematically examined native and derived DCT peptides across CaV1, unveiling that the overall balance between cytosolic inhibition versus nuclear facilitation is spatially and temporally tuned by CMI of each DCT variant. Our findings not only resolve several controversies existing to DCT variants, but also propose a de novo scheme of CaV1-centric gene regulation: two concurrent routes of transcription signals initiated from either membrane CaV1 channels or nuclear CaV1-encoded peptides are subject to autonomous feedback tuning by peptide/channel interactions.",

    "abstract": "New proteomics methods make it possible to determine protein interaction maps at the proteome scale without the need for genetically encoded tags, opening up new organisms and tissue types to investigation. Current molecular and computational methods are oriented towards protein complexes that are soluble, stable, and discrete. However, the mammalian brain, among the most complicated and most heavily studied tissue types, derives many of its unique functions from protein interactions that are neither discrete nor soluble. Proteomics investigations into the global protein interaction landscape of the brain have therefore leveraged non-proteomics datasets to supplement their experiments. Here, we develop a novel, integrative proteomics pipeline and apply it to infer a global map of functional protein neighborhoods in the mouse brain without the aid of external datasets. By leveraging synaptosome enrichment and interactomics methods that target both soluble and insoluble protein fractions, we resolved protein interactions for key neural pathways, including those from refractory subcellular fractions such as the membrane and cytoskeleton. In comparison to external datasets, our observed interactions perform similarly to hand-curated synaptic protein interactions while also suggesting thousands of novel connections. We additionally employed cleavable chemical cross-linkers to detect direct binding partners and provide structural context. Our combined map suggests new protein pathways and novel mechanisms for proteins that underlie neurological diseases, including autism and epilepsy. Our results show that proteomics methods alone are sufficient to determine global interaction maps for proteins that are of broad interest to neuroscience. We anticipate that our map will be used to prioritize new research avenues and will pave the way towards future proteomics techniques that resolve protein interactions at ever greater resolution.",

    "abstract": "T cell exhaustion limits immune responses against cancer and is a major cause of resistance to CAR-T cell therapeutics. Using a model wherein tonic CAR signaling induces hallmark features of exhaustion, we employed a drug-regulatable CAR to test the impact of transient cessation of receptor signaling (i.e. \"rest\") on the development and maintenance of exhaustion. Induction of rest in exhausting or already-exhausted CAR-T cells resulted in acquisition of a memory-like phenotype, improved anti-tumor functionality, and wholescale transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. Similar results were achieved with the Src kinase inhibitor dasatinib, which reversibly suppresses CAR signaling. The degree of functional reinvigoration was proportional to the duration of rest and was associated with expression of transcription factors TCF1 and LEF1. This work demonstrates that transient cessation of CAR-T cell signaling can enhance anti-tumor potency by preventing or reversing exhaustion and challenges the paradigm that exhaustion is an epigenetically fixed state.",

    "abstract": "SHARPIN, together with RNF31/HOIP and RBCK1/HOIL1, form the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) E3 ligase that catalyzes M1-linked poly-ubiquitination. Mutations in RNF31/HOIP and RBCK/HOIL1 in humans and Sharpin in mice lead to auto-inflammation and immunodeficiency but the mechanism underlying the immune dysregulation remains unclear. We now show that the phenotype of the Sharpin-/- mice is dependent on CYLD, the deubiquitinase that removes K63-linked poly-ubiquitin chains. The dermatitis, disrupted splenic architecture, and loss of Peyers patches in the Sharpin-/- mice were fully reversed in Sharpin-/-Cyld-/- mice. There is enhanced association of RIPK1 with the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) following TNF stimulation in Sharpin-/- cells, and this is dependent on CYLD since it is reversed in Sharpin-/-Cyld-/- cells. Enhanced RIPK1 recruitment to the DISC in Sharpin-/- cells correlated with impaired phosphorylation of CYLD at serine 418, a modification reported to inhibit its enzymatic activity. The dermatitis in the Sharpin-/- mice was also ameliorated by the conditional deletion of Cyld using LysM-cre or Cx3cr1-cre indicating that CYLD-dependent death of myeloid cells is inflammatory. Our studies reveal that under physiological conditions, TNF- and RIPK1-dependent cell death is suppressed by the linear ubiquitin-dependent inhibition of CYLD. The Sharpin-/- phenotype illustrates the pathological consequences when CYLD inhibition fails.\n\nShort SummaryIn the absence of SHARPIN, cells fail to properly regulate the deubiquitinase CYLD, leading to RIPK1-mediated cell death. Deletion of Cyld reverses the sensitivity of Sharpin-/- cells to TNF-induced cell death, as well as the multi-organ inflammation and immune dysfunction observed in Sharpin-/- mice.",

    "abstract": "The ability to modulate gene expression in response to changes in the host environment is essential for survival of the kinetoplastid parasite Leishmania. Unlike most eukaryotes, gene expression in kinetoplastids is predominately regulated post-transcriptionally. Consequently, RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and mRNA-encoded sequence elements serve as primary determinants of gene regulation in these organisms; however, few have been ascribed roles in specific stress-response pathways. Leishmania lack the capacity for de novo purine synthesis and must scavenge these essential nutrients from the host. Leishmania have evolved a robust stress response to withstand sustained periods of purine scarcity during their lifecycle. The purine nucleobase transporter, LdNT3, is among the most substantially upregulated proteins in purine-starved L. donovani. Here we report that the post-translational stability of the LdNT3 protein is unchanged in response to purine starvation. Instead, LdNT3 upregulation is primarily mediated by a 33 nucleotide (nt) sequence in the LdNT3 mRNA 3-untranslated region that is predicted to adopt a stem-loop structure. While this sequence is highly conserved within the mRNAs of orthologous transporters in multiple kinetoplastid species, putative stem-loops from L. donovani and Trypanosoma brucei nucleobase transporter mRNAs are not functionally interchangeable for purine-responsive regulation. Through mutational analysis of the element, we demonstrate that species specificity is attributable to just three variant bases within the predicted loop. Finally, we provide evidence that the abundance of the trans-acting factor that binds the LdNT3 stem-loop in vivo is substantially higher than required for regulation of LdNT3 alone, implying a potential role in regulating other purine-responsive genes.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) share a common hallmark of insulin resistance. Besides Insulin Receptor (IR), two non-canonical RTKs, ALK and RYK, exhibit significant and consistent functional downregulation in post-mortem AD and T2D tissues. Incidentally, both have Grb2 as a common downstream adapter and NOX4 as a common ROS producing factor. Here we show that Grb2 and NOX4 play critical roles in reducing the severity of both the diseases. The study demonstrates that the abundance of Grb2 in degenerative conditions, in conjunction with NOX4, reverse cytoskeletal degradation by counterbalancing the network of small GTPases. PAX4, a transcription factor for both Grb2 and NOX4, emerges as the key link between the common pathways of AD and T2D. Both ALK and RYK downregulation elevate the PAX4 level by reducing its suppressor ARX via Wnt/{beta}-Catenin signaling pathway. For the first time, this study brings together RTKs other than Insulin Receptor (IR), their common transcription factor PAX4 and both AD and T2D pathologies on a common regulatory platform.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, chromatin structure is linked to transcription processes through the regulation of genome organization. Extending across multiple length-scales - from the nucleosome to higher-order three-dimensional structures - chromatin is a dynamic system which evolves throughout the lifetime of a cell. However, no individual technique can fully elucidate the behavior of chromatin organization and its relation to molecular function at all length- and timescales at both a single-cell and a cell population level. Herein, we present a multi-technique nanoscale Chromatin Imaging and Analysis (nano-ChIA) platform that bridges electron tomography and optical superresolution imaging of chromatin conformation and transcriptional processes, with resolution down to the level of individual nucleosomes, with high-throughput, label-free analysis of chromatin packing and its dynamics in live cells. Utilizing nano-ChIA, we observed that chromatin is localized into spatially separable packing domains, with an average diameter of around 200 nm, sub-Mb genomic size, and an internal fractal structure. The chromatin packing behavior of these domains is directly influenced by active gene transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the chromatin packing domain structure is correlated among progenitor cells and all their progeny, indicating that the organization of chromatin into fractal packing domains is heritable across cell division. Further studies employing the nano-ChIA platform have the potential to provide a more coherent picture of chromatin structure and its relation to molecular function.",

Unregulated protease activity is a biomarker of several human diseases. Synthetic peptides that are selectively hydrolyzed by a protease of interest can be used as reporter substrates of unregulated protease activity. We developed an activity-based protease sensor by immobilizing magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) to the surface of a giant magnetoresistive spin-valve (GMR SV) sensor using peptides. Cleavage of these peptides by a protease, releases the magnetic nanoparticles resulting in a time-dependent change in the local magnetic field. Using this approach, we detected a significant release of MNPs after 3.5 minutes incubation using just 4 nM of the cysteine protease, papain. In addition, we show that proteases in healthy human urine do not release the MNPs, however addition of 20 nM of papain to the urine samples resulted in a time-dependent change in magnetoresistance. This study lays the foundation for using GMR SV sensors as a platform for real-time quantitative detection of protease activity in biological fluids.",

Mutations in several genes that encode components of the intraflagellar transport-A ciliary protein complex have been identified in skeletal ciliopathies, including THM1. Here, we report a role for genetic interaction between Thm1 and its paralog, Thm2, in skeletogenesis. THM2 localizes to the ciliary axoneme, but unlike its paralog, Thm2 deficiency does not affect ciliogenesis and Thm2-null mice survive into adulthood. Since paralogs often have redundant functions, we crossed a Thm1 null (aln) allele into the Thm2 colony. After 5 generations of backcrossing the colony onto a C57BL6/J background, we observed that by postnatal day 14, Thm2-/-; Thm1aln/+ mice are smaller than control littermates. Thm2-/-; Thm1aln/+ mice exhibit shortened long bones, narrow ribcage, shortened cranium and mandibular defects. Mutant mice also show aberrant architecture of the tibial growth plate, with an expanded proliferation zone and diminished hypertrophic zone, indicating impaired chondrocyte differentiation. Using microcomputed tomography, Thm2-/-; Thm1aln/+ tibia were revealed to have reduced cortical and trabecular bone mineral density. Deletion of one allele of Gli2, a major transcriptional activator of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, exacerbated the small phenotype of Thm2-/-; Thm1aln/+ mice and caused small stature in Thm2-null mice. Together, these data reveal Thm2 as a novel locus that sensitizes to Hh signaling in skeletal development. Further, Thm2-/-; Thm1aln/+ mice present a new postnatal ciliopathy model of osteochondrodysplasia.",

Our objectives were to characterize the genetic relationships of the 2019-nCoV and to search for putative recombination within the subgenus of sarbecovirus.\n\nMethodsPutative recombination was investigated by RDP4 and Simplot v3.5.1 and discordant phylogenetic clustering in individual genomic fragments was confirmed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods.\n\nResultsOur analysis suggests that the 2019-nCoV although closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 sequence throughout the genome (sequence similarity 96.3%), shows discordant clustering with the Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences. Specifically, in the 5-part spanning the first 11,498 nucleotides and the last 3-part spanning 24,341-30,696 positions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 formed a single cluster with Bat-SARS-like coronavirus sequences, whereas in the middle region spanning the 3-end of ORF1a, the ORF1b and almost half of the spike regions, 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 grouped in a separate distant lineage within the sarbecovirus branch.\n\nConclusionsThe levels of genetic similarity between the 2019-nCoV and RaTG13 suggest that the latter does not provide the exact variant that caused the outbreak in humans, but the hypothesis that 2019-nCoV has originated from bats is very likely. We show evidence that the novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) is not-mosaic consisting in almost half of its genome of a distinct lineage within the betacoronavirus. These genomic features and their potential association with virus characteristics and virulence in humans need further attention.",

We used genome editing to generate isogenic iPSC lines and model HSS in relevant cell types. We show that CHD6 binds a cohort of autophagy and stress response genes across cell types. The HSS-mutation affects CHD6 protein folding and impairs its ability to recruit co-factors in response to DNA damage or autophagy stimulation. This leads to an accumulation of DNA damage burden and to senescence-like phenotypes.

    "abstract": "Caspase-4 directly senses and is activated by cytosolic LPS in conditions of pathogen infection. It is unclear whether and how caspase-4 detects host derived factors for triggering pyroptosis. Here we show that mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) promotes the assembly of a protein complex comprised of Apaf-1 and caspase-4 (caspase-11 in mice), defined herein as pyroptosome, for the execution of facilitated pyroptosis. MPT induced by bile acids and calcium overload, and specifically by an adenine nucleotide translocator 1 (ANT1) activator, triggered pyroptosome assembly. Different from the direct cleavage of GSDMD by LPS-activated caspase-4, caspase-4 activated in the Apaf-1 pyroptosome proceeds to cleave caspase-3 and thereby gasdermin E (GSDME) to induce pyroptosis. Caspase-11 initiated and GSDME executed pyroptosis underlies cholesteric liver failure.

    "abstract": "Background and aimsUpland rice is often grown where water and phosphorus (P) are limited and these two factors interact on P bioavailability. To better understand this interaction, mechanistic models representing small-scale nutrient gradients and water dynamics in the rhizosphere of full-grown root systems are needed.\n\nMethodsRice was grown in large columns using a P-deficient soil at three different P supplies in the topsoil (deficient, suboptimal, non-limiting) in combination with two water regimes (field capacity versus drying periods). Root architectural parameters and P uptake were determined. Using a multiscale model of water and nutrient uptake, in-silico experiments were conducted by mimicking similar P and water treatments. First, 3D root systems were reconstructed by calibrating an architecure model with observed phenological root data, such as nodal root number, lateral types, interbranch distance, root diameters, and root biomass allocation along depth. Secondly, the multiscale model was informed with these 3D root architectures and the actual transpiration rates. Finally, water and P uptake were simulated.\n\nKey resultsThe plant P uptake increased over threefold by increasing P and water supply, and drying periods reduced P uptake at high but not at low P supply. Root architecture was significantly affected by the treatments. Without calibration, simulation results adequately predicted P uptake, including the different effects of drying periods on P uptake at different P levels. However, P uptake was underestimated under P deficiency, a process likely related to an underestimated affinity of P uptake transporters in the roots. Both types of laterals (i.e. S- and L-type) are shown to be highly important for both water and P uptake, and the relative contribution of each type depend on both soil P availability and water dynamics. Key drivers in P uptake are growing root tips and the distribution of laterals.\n\nConclusionsThis model-data integration demonstrates how multiple co-occurring single root phene responses to environmental stressors contribute to the development of a more efficient root system. Further model improvements such as the use of Michaelis constants from buffered systems and the inclusion of mycorrhizal infections and exudates are proposed.",

Assaying the functions of circRNAs is not straightforward as common approaches for circRNA depletion tend to also alter the levels of mRNAs generated from the hosting gene. Here we describe a methodology for specific knockdown of circRNAs in vivo with tissue and cell resolution. We also describe an experimental and computational platform for determining the potential off-target effects as well as for verifying the obtained phenotypes. Briefly, we utilize miRNA-derived shRNAs targeted to the circRNA-specific back-splice junction to specifically downregulate the circRNA. We utilized this methodology to downregulate five circRNAs that are highly expressed in the fly nervous system. There were no effects on levels of the linear RNA or any RNA with complementarity to the expressed shRNA. Interestingly, downregulation of circCtrip resulted in developmental lethality that was recapitulated with a second shRNA. Moreover, we found that downregulation of individual circRNAs caused specific changes in the fly head transcriptome, suggesting roles for these circRNAs in the fly nervous system. Together, our results provide a methodological approach that enables the comprehensive study of circRNAs at the organismal and cell levels.",

    "abstract": "Flavivirus is a genus of emerging and re-emerging arboviruses which include many significant human pathogens. Non-structural protein 3 (NS3), a multifunctional protein with N-terminal protease and C-terminal helicase, is essential in viral replication. The NS3 protease together with NS2B cofactor is an attractive antiviral target. A construct with an artificial glycine linker connecting the NS2B cofactor and NS3 protease has been used for structural, biochemical and drug-screening studies. The effect of this linker on dynamics and enzymatic activity of the protease was studied by several biochemical and NMR methods but the findings remained inconclusive. Here, we designed constructs of NS2B cofactor joined to full length DENV4 NS3 in three different manners, namely bNS2B47NS3 (bivalent), eNS2B47NS3(enzymatically cleavable) and gNS2B47NS3 (glycine-rich G4SG4 linker). We report the first crystal structures of linked and unlinked full-length NS2B-NS3 enzyme in its free state and also in complex with Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI). These structures demonstrate that the NS2B-NS3 protease mainly adopts a closed conformation. BPTI binding is not essential to but favors the closed conformation by interacting with both NS2B and NS3. The artificial linker between NS2B and NS3 tends to induce the open conformation and interfere with the protease activity. This negative impact on the enzyme structure and function is restricted to the protease domain as the ATPase activities of these constructs are not affected.",

    "abstract": "The widely consumed neuroactive compound caffeine has generated much interest due to its ability to override the DNA damage and replication checkpoints. Previously Rad3 and its homologues was thought to be the target of caffeines inhibitory activity. Later findings indicate that the Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1) is the preferred target of caffeine. Effective Cdc2 inhibition requires both the activation of the Wee1 kinase and inhibition of the Cdc25 phosphatase. The TORC1, DNA damage, and environmental stress response pathways all converge on Cdc25 and Wee1. We previously demonstrated that caffeine overrides DNA damage checkpoints by modulating Cdc25 stability. The effect of caffeine on cell cycle progression resembles that of TORC1 inhibition. Furthermore, caffeine activates the Sty1 regulated environmental stress response. Caffeine may thus modulate multiple signalling pathways that regulate Cdc25 and Wee1 levels, localisation and activity. Here we show that the activity of caffeine stabilises both Cdc25 and Wee1. The stabilising effect of caffeine and genotoxic agents on Wee1 was dependent on the Rad24 chaperone. Interestingly, caffeine inhibited the accumulation of Wee1 in response to DNA damage. Caffeine therefore modulates cell cycle progression contextually through increased Cdc25 activity and Wee1 repression following DNA damage via TORC1 inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are often expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), suggesting they are proxies or are themselves regulatory. Across many datasets analyses show that variants often affect multiple genes. Lacking data on many tissue types, developmental time points and homogeneous cell types, the extent of this one-to-many relationship is underestimated. This raises questions on whether a disease eQTL target gene explains the genetic association or is a by-stander and puts into question the direction of expression effect of on the risk, since the many variant - regulated genes may have opposing effects, imperfectly balancing each other. We used two brain gene expression datasets (CommonMind and BrainSeq) for mediation analysis of schizophrenia-associated variants. We confirm that eQTL target genes often mediate risk but the direction in which expression affects risk is often different from that in which the risk allele changes expression. Of 38 mediator genes significant in both datasets 33 showed consistent mediation direction (Chi2 test P=6*10-6). One might expect that the expression would correlate with the risk allele in the same direction it correlates with disease. For 15 of these 33 (45%), however, the expression change associated with the risk allele was protective, suggesting the likely presence of other target genes with overriding effects. Our results identify specific risk mediating genes and suggest caution in interpreting the biological consequences of targeted modifications of gene expression, as not all eQTL targets may be relevant to disease while those that are, might have different than expected directions.",

In the renal tubulo-interstitium specialized dendritic cells help maintain homeostasis and protect tubuli from immune injury. Human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is immunogenic; yet immunotherapies that target T-cell dysfunction show limited clinical efficacy suggesting additional mechanisms of immunoinhibiton. We previously described \"enriched-in-renal cell carcinoma\" (erc)DCs that are often found in tight contact with T cells which are dysfunctional. Here we describe that ercDCs exhibit a distinct polarization state imparted by tissue-specific signals characteristic for RCC and renal tissue homeostasis. The resulting mosaic transcript signature includes features associated with host defense activity, angiogenesis/invasion and T-cell inhibition. An ercDC-specific profile was predictive for patient survival and suggests potential therapeutic targets for improved immunotherapy.\n\nSignificanceImmunotherapies, which re-invigorate T-cell activity, achieve clinical responses in subsets of patients only revealing additional layers of T-cell inhibition. Mononuclear phagocytes can be immunoinhibitory. But, they are highly plastic and repolarization may be possible if key programming molecules can be identified, potentially enabling antitumor responses in tumors refractory to checkpoint blockade. We describe a myeloid cell type with mosaic feature including tumor-promotion and immunoinhibition in human clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Observed tight contacts with T cells may translate into T-cell dysfunction.

Autism affects males more frequently than females and sex-related mechanisms (e.g., X-linked genes, androgen hormones) can influence E:I balance. This suggests that E:I imbalance may affect autism differently in males versus females. With a combination of in-silico modeling and in-vivo chemogenetic manipulations in mice, we first show that a time-series metric estimated from fMRI BOLD signal, the Hurst exponent (H), can be an index for underlying change in the synaptic E:I ratio. In autism we find that H is reduced, indicating increased excitation, in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) of autistic males but not females. Increasingly intact MPFC H is also associated with heightened ability to behaviorally camouflage social-communicative difficulties, but only in autistic females. This work suggests that H in BOLD can index synaptic E:I ratio and that E:I imbalance affects autistic males and females differently.",

It provides a simple, inexpensive and robust means of conducting in-field diagnosis without requiring internet connection and provides real-time results and advice. The present work evaluates the effectiveness of Nuru as an in-field diagnostic tool by comparing the diagnosis capability of Nuru to that of cassava experts (researchers trained on cassava pests and diseases), agricultural extension agents and farmers.\n\nMethodsThe diagnosis capability of Nuru and that of the assessed individuals was determined by inspecting cassava plants in-field and by using the cassava symptom recognition assessment tool (CaSRAT) to score images of cassava leaves.\n\nResultsNurus accuracy for symptom recognition when using six leaves (74 - 88%, depending on the condition) was similar to that of experts, 1.5-times higher than agricultural extension agents and two-times higher than farmers.\n\nDiscussionThese findings suggests that Nuru can be an effective tool for in-field diagnosis of cassava diseases and has a potential of being a quick and cost-effective means of disseminating knowledge from researchers to agricultural extension agents and farmers.",

Here, we performed comprehensive lipidomics to create a lipid network map during ZIKV infection. We found that ZIKV significantly alters host lipid composition, with the most striking changes seen within subclasses of sphingolipids. Ectopic expression of ZIKV NS4B protein resulted in similar changes, demonstrating a role for NS4B in modulating sphingolipid pathways. Disruption of sphingolipid biosynthesis in various cell types, including human neural progenitor cells, blocked ZIKV infection. Additionally, the sphingolipid ceramide redistributes to ZIKV replication sites and increasing ceramide levels by multiple pathways sensitizes cells to ZIKV infection. Thus, we identify a sphingolipid metabolic network with a critical role in ZIKV replication and show that ceramide flux is a key mediator of ZIKV infection.",

The disease is especially difficult in the organic crop, which currently relies on resistant varieties to maintain disease-free crop. Alternative control measures are available, but it is not clear how growers perceive the efficacy of these methods. It is also not clear who growers contact to find out information on spinach downy mildew disease management. In this study, we conducted an online survey of people involved in spinach production, asking about their beliefs in the efficacy of different control methods and who they contact frequently to discuss spinach downy mildew control. We found that respondents were most positive about the efficacy of resistant varieties and synthetic pesticides, with much lower perceived efficacy for the practices of disking diseased fields, roguing diseased plants, and organic pesticides. Growers most frequently contacted pest control advisors (PCAs) about management strategies for spinach downy mildew. These results suggest that respondents are most confident about the efficacy of resistant varieties and synthetic pesticides and may be hesitant to adopt new control strategies like organic pesticides. The results also suggest that future extension efforts can be focused on PCAs to reach the most stakeholders with up to date research on downy mildew control.",

Super-resolution unaffected by optical aberrations, undetectable phototoxicity, fast image acquisition rate and ease of use, altogether, make RIM ideally suited for functional live cell imaging in situ.

Several molecular mechanisms for protein induced membrane curvature have been described in some detail. Contrary, the effect that the physico-chemical properties of the membrane has on these processes is far less well understood. Here, we show that the membrane binding and curvature-inducing ENTH domain of epsin1 is regulated by phosphatidylserine (PS). ENTH binds to membranes in a PI(4,5)P2-dependent manner but only induces curvature in the presence of PS. On PS-containing membranes, the ENTH domain forms rigid homo-oligomers and assembles into clusters. Membrane binding and membrane remodeling can be separated by structure-to-function mutants. Such oligomerization mutants bind to membranes but do not show membrane remodeling activity. In vivo they are not able to rescue defects in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) endocytosis in epsin knock-down cells. Together, these data show that the membrane lipid composition is important for the regulation of protein-dependent membrane deformation during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",

The current work aimed to assess the association of GM composition with AF recurrence (RAF) after ablation, and to construct a GM-based predictive model for RAF. Gut microbial composition and metabolic profiles were assessed based on metagenomic sequencing and metabolomic analyses. Compared with non-AF controls (50 individuals), GM composition and metabolomic profile were significantly altered between patients with recurrent AF (17 individuals) and the non-RAF group (23 individuals). Notably, discriminative taxa between the non-RAF and RAF groups, including the families Nitrosomonadaceae and Lentisphaeraceae, the genera Marinitoga and Rufibacter, and the species Faecalibacterium sp. CAG:82, Bacillus gobiensis, and Desulfobacterales bacterium PC51MH44, were selected to construct a taxonomic scoring system based on LASSO analysis. An elevated area under curve (0.954) and positive net reclassification index (1.5601) for predicting RAF compared with traditional clinical scoring (AUC=0.6918) were obtained. The GM-based taxonomic scoring system theoretically improves the model performance.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWA special class of random walks, so-called Levy walks, has been observed in a variety of organisms ranging from cells, insects, fishes, and birds to mammals, including humans. Although their prevalence is considered to be a consequence of natural selection for higher search efficiency, some findings suggest that Levy walks might also be epiphenomena that arise from interactions with the environment. Therefore, why they are common in biological movements remains an open question. Based on some evidence that Levy walks are spontaneously generated in the brain and the fact that power-law distributions in Levy walks can emerge at a critical point, we hypothesized that the advantages of Levy walks might be enhanced by criticality. However, the functional advantages of Levy walks are poorly understood. Here, we modeled nonlinear systems for the generation of locomotion and showed that Levy walks emerging near a critical point had optimal dynamic ranges for coding information. This discovery suggested that Levy walks could change movement trajectories based on the magnitude of environmental stimuli. We then showed that the high flexibility of Levy walks enabled switching exploitation/exploration based on the nature of external cues. Finally, we analyzed the movement trajectories of freely moving Drosophila larvae and showed empirically that the Levy walks may emerge near a critical point and have the large dynamic range and high flexibility. Our results suggest that the commonly observed Levy walks emerge near a critical point and could be explained on the basis of these functional advantages.",

Popular coalescent inference approaches such as the Bayesian Skyline Plot, Skyride and Skygrid all model these population size changes with a discontinuous, piecewise-constant function but then apply a smoothing prior to ensure that their posterior population size estimates transition gradually with time. These prior distributions implicitly encode extra population size information that is not available from the observed coalescent data i.e., the tree. Here we present a novel statistic, {Omega}, to quantify and disaggregate the relative contributions of the coalescent data and prior assumptions to the resulting posterior estimate precision. Our statistic also measures the additional mutual information introduced by such priors. Using {Omega} we show that, because it is surprisingly easy to over-parametrise piecewise-constant population models, common smoothing priors can lead to overconfident and potentially misleading inference, even under robust experimental designs. We propose {Omega} as a useful tool for detecting when effective population size estimates are overly reliant on prior assumptions and for improving quantification of the uncertainty in those estimates.",

The tree reveals that the Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) possessed at least 92 ePKs, much more than previously thought. The retention of these LECA ePKs in present-day species is highly variable. Fourteen human kinases with unresolved placement in the human kinome tree were found to originate from three known ePK superfamilies. Further analysis of ePK superfamilies shows that they exhibit markedly diverse evolutionary dynamics between the LECA and present-day eukaryotes. The eukaryotic kinome tree thus unveils the evolutionary history of ePKs, but the tree also enables the transfer of functional information between related kinases.",

    "abstract": "Cytosine methylation is an ancient epigenetic modification yet its function and extent within genomes is highly variable across eukaryotes. In mammals, methylation controls transposable elements and regulates the promoters of genes. In insects, DNA methylation is generally restricted to a small subset of transcribed genes, with both intergenic regions and transposable elements (TEs) depleted of methylation. The evolutionary origin and the function of these methylation patterns are poorly understood. Here we characterise the evolution of DNA methylation across the arthropod phylum. While the common ancestor of the arthropods had low levels of TE methylation and did not methylate promoters, both of these functions have evolved independently in centipedes and mealybugs. In contrast, methylation of the exons of a subset of transcribed genes is ancestral and widely conserved across the phylum, but has been lost in specific lineages. Remarkably the same set of genes are likely to be methylated in all species that retained exon-enriched methylation. We show that these genes have characteristic patterns of expression correlating to broad transcription initiation sites and well-positioned nucleosomes, providing new insights into potential mechanisms driving methylation patterns over hundreds of millions of years.\n\nAuthor SummaryAnimals develop from a single cell to form a complex organism with many specialised cells. Almost all of the fantastic variety of cells must have the same sequence of DNA, and yet they have distinct identities that are preserved even when they divide. This remarkable process is achieved by turning different sets of genes on or off in different types of cell using molecular mechanisms known as \"epigenetic gene regulation\".\n\nSurprisingly, though all animals need epigenetic gene regulation, there is a huge diversity in the mechanisms that they use. Characterising and explaining this diversity is crucial in understanding the functions of epigenetic pathways, many of which have key roles in human disease. We studied how one particular type of epigenetic regulation, known as DNA methylation, has evolved within arthropods. Arthropods are an extraordinarily diverse group of animals ranging from horseshoe crabs to fruit flies. We discovered that the levels of DNA methylation and where it is found within the genome changes rapidly throughout arthropod evolution. Nevertheless, there are some features of DNA methylation that seem to be the same across most arthropods-in particular we found that there is a tendency for a similar set of genes to acquire methylation of DNA in most arthropods, and that this is conserved over 350 million years. We discovered that these genes have distinct features that might explain how methylation gets targeted. Our work provides important new insights into the evolution of DNA methylation and gives some new hints to its essential functions.",

    "abstract": "Recent advancements in the field of experimental structural biology have provided high-resolution structures of active and inactive state G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a highly important pharmaceutical target family, but the process of transition between these states is poorly understood. According to the current theory, GPCRs exist in structurally distinct, dynamically interconverting functional states of which populations are shifted upon binding of ligands and intracellular signaling proteins. However, explanation of the activation mechanism on an entirely structural basis gets complicated when multiple activation pathways and active receptor states are considered. Our unbiased, atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the mu-opioid receptor in a physiological environment revealed that external stimulus is propagated to the intracellular surface of the receptor through subtle, concerted movements of highly conserved polar amino acid side chains along the 7th transmembrane helix. To amend the widely accepted theory we suggest that the initiation event of GPCR activation is the shift of macroscopic polarization between the ortho- and allosteric binding pockets and the intracellular G protein-binding interface.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=184 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/920769v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@102f33org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8af6bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14d9192org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1903819_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Table of Contents Graphic\n\nC_FIG",

We incorporated these into an updated genome-scale metabolic network model of CHO cells, named iCHO2101. In this updated model, the number of reactions and pathways capable of carrying flux is substantially increased.\n\nConclusionsThe present CHO model is an important step towards more complete metabolic models of CHO cells.",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of connective tissue integrity is fundamental to sustain function, requiring protein turnover to repair damaged tissue. However, connective tissue proteome dynamics remain largely undefined, as do differences in turnover rates of individual proteins in the collagen and glycoprotein phases of connective tissue extracellular matrix (ECM). Here, we investigate proteome dynamics in the collagen and glycoprotein phases of connective tissues by exploiting the spatially distinct fascicular (collagen-rich) and interfascicular (glycoprotein-rich) ECM phases of tendon. Using isotope labelling, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics, we calculate turnover rates of individual proteins within rat Achilles tendon and its ECM phases. Our results demonstrate complex proteome dynamics in tendon, with ~1000-fold differences in protein turnover rates, and overall faster protein turnover within the glycoprotein-rich interfascicular matrix compared to the collagen-rich fascicular matrix. These data provide insights into the complexity of proteome dynamics in tendon, likely required to maintain tissue homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Wildlife managers are concerned with transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) as they are currently incurable, always fatal, and have the potential to cross species boundaries. Although a wide range of mammals exhibit TSEs, it is currently unclear whether they are evolutionarily clustered or if TSE+ species are randomly distributed phylogenetically. We tested whether mammalian species with TSEs are phylogenetically underdispersed on a tree derived from 102 PRNP sequences obtained from the Orthologous Mammalian Markers database. We determined that the PRNP tree was topologically congruent with a species tree for these same 102 taxa constructed from 20 aligned gene sequences, excluding the PRNP sequence. Searches in Google Scholar were done to determine whether a species is known to have expressed a TSE. TSEs were present in a variety of orders excluding Chiroptera, Eulipotyphyla, and Lagomorpha and no marine mammals (Artiodactyla) were recorded to have a TSE. We calculated the phylogenetic signal of binary traits (D-Value) to infer if the phylogenetic distribution of TSEs are conserved or dispersed. The occurrence of TSEs in both trees is non-random (Species tree D-value = 0.291; PRNP tree D-value = 0.273), and appears to have arisen independently in the recent history of different mammalian groups. Our findings suggest that the evolution of TSEs develops in groups of species irrespective of PRNP genotype. The evolution of TSEs merits continued exploration at a more in-depth phylogenetic level, as well as the search for genetic combinations that might underlie TSE diseases.",

    "abstract": "Mating-type switching is a complex mechanism that promotes sexual reproduction in Ascomycotina. In the model species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mating-type switching is initiated by the Ho endonuclease that performs a site-specific double-strand break (DSB) at MAT, repaired by homologous recombination (HR) using one of the two silent mating type cassettes, HMLalpha and HMRa. The reasons why all the elements of the mating-type switching system have been conserved in some Ascomycotina, that do not show a sexual cycle nor mating-type switching, remain unknown. To gain insight on this phenomenon, we used the opportunistic pathogenic yeast Candida glabrata, phylogenetically close to S. cerevisiae, and for which no spontaneous and efficient mating-type switching has been observed. We have previously shown that expression of S. cerevisiaes HO gene triggers mating-type switching in C. glabrata, but this leads to massive cell death. In addition, we unexpectedly found, that not only MAT but also HML was cut in this species, suggesting the formation of multiple chromosomal DSBs upon HO induction.\n\nWe now report that HMR is also cut by S. cerevisiaes Ho in wild-type strains of C. glabrata. To understand the link between mating-type switching and cell death in C. glabrata, we constructed strains mutated precisely at the Ho recognition sites. By mimicking S. cerevisiaes situation, in which HML and HMR are protected from the cut, we unexpectedly find that one DSB at MAT is sufficient to induce cell death. We demonstrate that mating-type switching in C. glabrata can be triggered using CRISPR-Cas9, without high lethality. We also show that switching is Rad51-dependent, as in S. cerevisiae but that donor preference is not conserved in C. glabrata. Altogether, these results suggest that a DSB at MAT can be repaired by HR in C. glabrata, but that it is prevented by S. cerevisiaes Ho.\n\nAuthor summaryMating-type switching is one of the strategies developed by fungi to promote crossing, sexual reproduction and propagation. This mechanism enables one haploid cell to give rise to a cell of the opposite mating-type so that they can mate together. It has been extensively studied in the model yeast S. cerevisiae in which it relies on a programmed double-strand break performed by the Ho endonuclease at the MAT locus which encodes the key regulators of sexual identity. Little is known about why the mating-type switching components have been conserved in species like C.glabrata, in which neither sexual reproduction nor mating-type switching is observed. We have previously shown that mating-type switching can be triggered, in C. glabrata, by expression of the HO gene from S. cerevisiae but this leads to massive cell death. We report here evidence toward a degeneration of the mating-type switching system in C. glabrata. We demonstrate that the DSB at MAT is only lethal when the Ho endonuclease performs the break, a situation unique to C. glabrata. Finally, we show that mating-type switching in C. glabrata can be triggered by CRISPR-Cas9 and without any high lethality.",

    "abstract": "In our previous study, we demonstrated that hyaluronan induces odontoblastic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells via interactions with CD44. However, it remains unclear whether CD44 expression by dental pulp stem cells is required for odontoblastic differentiation. Therefore, we searched for a compound that induces odontoblastic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells, regardless of the chemical structure and function of hyaluronan, and examined whether CD44 is involved in the induction of odontoblastic differentiation by the compound. Because vitamin K analogues can promote bone formation and tissue calcification, we focused on derivatives of naphthoquinone, the skeleton of vitamin K; we verified whether those compounds could induce odontoblastic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells. We found that dentin sialophosphoprotein, a marker of odontoblasts, was expressed in dental pulp stem cells after treatment with shikonin. The shikonin-induced expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein was inhibited by PI3K, AKT, and mTOR inhibitors. In addition, in dental pulp stem cells transfected with siRNA against CD44, the shikonin-induced expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein was inhibited. Thus, shikonin can stimulate dental pulp stem cells to undergo odontoblastic differentiation through a mechanism involving the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and CD44. Hyaluronan stimulated dental pulp stem cells to undergo CD44-mediated odontoblastic differentiation in our previous study; the present study indicated that CD44 is necessary for dental pulp stem cells to undergo odontoblastic differentiation. Although expression of CD44 is important for inducing odontoblastic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells, the relationship between the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway and CD44 expression, in the context of shikonin stimulation, has not yet been elucidated. This study suggested that shikonin may be useful for inducing odontoblastic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells, and that it may have clinical applications, including protection of dental pulp.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of global transcriptomes using conventional short-read sequencing is challenging because of the insensitivity of these platforms to transcripts isoforms, multigenic RNA molecules, and transcriptional overlaps, etc. Long-read sequencing (LRS) can overcome these limitations by reading full-length transcripts. Employment of these technologies has led to the redefinition of transcriptional complexities in reported organisms. In this study, we applied LRS platforms from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies to profile the dynamic vaccinia virus (VACV) transcriptome and assess the effect of viral infection on host gene expression. We performed cDNA and direct RNA sequencing analyses and revealed an extremely complex transcriptional landscape of this virus. In particular, VACV genes produce large numbers of transcript isoforms that vary in their start and termination sites. A significant fraction of VACV transcripts start or end within coding regions of neighboring genes. We distinguished five classes of host genes according to their temporal responses to viral infection. This study provides novel insights into the transcriptomic profile of a viral pathogen and the effect of the virus on host gene expression.\n\nAuthor SummaryViral transcriptomes that are determined using conventional (first- and second-generation) sequencing techniques are incomplete because these platforms are inefficient or fail to distinguish between types of transcripts and transcript isoforms. In particular, conventional sequencing techniques fail to distinguish between parallel overlapping transcripts, including alternative polycistronic transcripts, transcriptional start site (TSS) and transcriptional end site (TES) isoforms, and splice variants and RNA molecules that are produced by transcriptional read-throughs. Long-read sequencing (LRS) can provide complete sets of RNA molecules, and can therefore be used to assemble complete transcriptome atlases of organisms. Although vaccinia virus (VACV) does not produce spliced RNAs, its transcriptome contains large numbers of TSSs and TESs for individual viral genes and has a high degree of polycistronism, together leading to enormous complexity. In this study, we applied single molecule real-time and nanopore-based cDNA and direct-RNA sequencing methods to investigate transcripts of VACV and the host organism.",

    "abstract": "The conservation of T cell epitopes in human influenza A virus has prompted the development of T cell-inducing influenza vaccines. However, the selection pressure mediated by memory CD8 T cells upon influenza virus has not been directly measured. Using a droplet digital PCR technique to distinguish wild-type and an epitope-mutant PR8 influenza viruses in vivo, this study quantifies the viral replicative fitness of a CD8 T cell-escaping mutation in the immunodominant influenza NP366-374 epitope in C57BL/6 (B6) mice under different settings of cellular immunity. Although this mutation does not result in a viral fitness defect in vitro or during the early stages of in vivo infection in naive B6 mice, it does confer a moderate but consistent advantage to the mutant virus following heterosubtypic challenge of HKx31-immunized mice. In addition, this advantage was maintained under increased MHC diversity but became more substantial when the breadth of epitope recognition is limited. Finally, we showed that lung-resident, but not circulating, memory CD8 T cells are the primary source of cellular immune pressure early during infection, prior to the induction of a secondary effector T cell response. Integrating the data with an established modeling framework, we show that the relatively modest immune pressure mediated by memory CD8 T cells is one of the important factors responsible for the conservation of CD8 T cell epitopes in influenza A viruses that circulate among humans. Thus, a T cell-inducing vaccine that generates lung-resident memory CD8 T cells covering a sufficient breadth of epitopes may transiently protect against severe pathology without driving the virus to rapidly evolve and escape.\n\nAuthor SummarySince the historic Spanish flu in 1918, influenza has caused several pandemics and become an important public health concern. The inactivated vaccines routinely used attempt to boost antibodies, which may not be as effective when antigenic mismatch happens and could drive the virus to evolve and escape due to their high immune pressure. In contrast, the ability of influenza-specific T cells to reduce pathology and the conservation of T-cell epitopes across subtypes have shed light on the development of universal vaccines. In this study, we assessed the CD8 T cell-mediated selection pressure on influenza virus in mouse using a digital PCR technique. Within mice that have influenza-specific systemic and lung-resident memory CD8 T cells established, we found the advantage conferred by an escaping mutation in one of the immunodominant epitopes is around 25%. This advantage becomes much greater when the cellular immunity focuses on the focal epitope, while it is delayed when only systemic cellular immunity is established. Combining the data with our previous modeling work, we conclude that the small selection pressure imposed by CD8 T cells can explain the overall conservation of CD8 T cell epitopes of influenza A virus in addition to functional constraint.",

Adhesion was quantified in a Neubauer chamber, counting the number of yeast cells adhered to the fragments; Biofilm formation was determined by counting the number of colony forming units (CFU). The intensity of biofilm formation adhesion was classified as negative, weak, moderate, strong and very strong. Fifteen compounds were identified in green propolis extract, mainly flavonoids.\n\nResultsAll strains were able to adhere and form biofilm on the surface of the orthodontic materials studied. In steel and resin, the adhesion intensity of the yeast cells was weak at all incubation times, except for C. parapsilosis and C. tropicalis which at 12hs showed moderate intensity. Regarding biofilm formation (24 and 48 hours), it was observed in the steel that C. albicans had moderate intensity at 24 and 48 hours; C. parapsilosis at 24 and 48 hours had very strong intensity; C. tropicalis at 24 hours had strong intensity and at 48 hours very strong. While in the resin, all species at 24 and 48 hours had strong intensity, except for C. tropicalis which at 48 hours had very strong intensity. Green propolis extract showed antifungal activity and was able to inhibit both adhesion and biofilm formation at 2.5 g/mL.\n\nConclusionsThis study reinforces the idea that green propolis has antifungal activity and interferes with virulence factors of Candida species.",

Using purified RecA and a known pH-sensitive mutant variant RecA K250R we show how pH can affect the biochemical activity of a protein central to control of the bacterial DNA damage response system. Finally, two different mutagenesis assays indicate that environmental pH affects antibiotic resistance development.

    "abstract": "Mutations in pitrilysin metallopeptidase 1 (PITRM1), a mitochondrial protease involved in mitochondrial precursor processing and degradation, result in a slow-progressive syndrome, characterized by cerebellar ataxia, psychotic episodes and obsessive behavior as well as cognitive decline. To investigate the pathogenetic mechanisms of mitochondrial presequence processing, we employed cortical neurons and cerebral organoids generated from PITRM1 knockout human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). PITRM1 deficiency strongly induced mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and enhanced mitochondrial clearance in iPSC-derived neurons. Furthermore, we observed increased levels of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid {beta} in PITRM1 knockout neurons. However, neither cell death nor protein aggregates were observed in 2D iPSC-derived cortical neuronal cultures. On the contrary, cerebral organoids generated from PITRM1 knockout iPSCs spontaneously developed over time pathological features of Alzheimers disease (AD), including accumulation of protein aggregates, tau pathology, and neuronal cell death. Importantly, we provide evidence for a protective role of UPRmt and mitochondrial clearance against impaired mitochondrial presequence processing and proteotoxic stress. In summary, we propose a novel concept of PITRM1-linked neurological syndrome whereby defects of mitochondrial presequence processing induce an early activation of UPRmt that, in turn, modulates cytosolic quality control pathways. Thus our work supports a mechanistic link between mitochondrial function and common neurodegenerative proteinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Assessing directional influences between neurons is instrumental to understand how brain circuits process information. To this end, Granger causality, a technique originally developed for time-continuous signals, has been extended to discrete spike trains. A fundamental assumption of this technique is that the temporal evolution of neuronal responses must be due only to endogenous interactions between recorded units, including self-interactions. This assumption is however rarely met in neurophysiological studies, where the response of each neuron is modulated by other exogenous causes such as, for example, other unobserved units or slow adaptation processes.\n\nHere, we propose a novel point-process Granger causality technique that is robust with respect to the two most common exogenous modulations observed in real neuronal responses: within-trial temporal variations in spiking rate and between-trial variability in their magnitudes. This novel method works by explicitly including both types of modulations into the generalized linear model of the neuronal conditional intensity function (CIF). We then assess the causal influence of neuron i onto neuron j by measuring the relative reduction of neuron js point process likelihood obtained considering or removing neuron i. CIFs hyper-parameters are set on a per-neuron basis by minimizing Akaikes information criterion.\n\nIn simulated data, the proposed method recovered with high accuracy the underlying ground-truth connectivity pattern. Application of presently available point-process Granger causality techniques produced instead a significant number of false positive connections. In real spiking responses recorded from neurons in the monkey pre-motor cortex (area F5), our method revealed many causal relationships between neurons as well as the temporal structure of their interactions. Given its robustness our method can be effectively applied to real neuronal data. Furthermore, its explicit estimate of the effects of unobserved causes on the recorded neuronal firing patterns can help decomposing their temporal variations into endogenous and exogenous components.\n\nAuthor summaryModern techniques in Neuroscience allow to investigate the brain at the network level by studying the flow of information between neurons. To this end, Granger causality has been extended to point process spike trains. A fundamental assumption of this technique is that there should be no unobserved causes of temporal variability in the recorded spike trains. This, however, greatly limits its applicability to real neuronal recordings as very often not all the sources of variability in neuronal responses can be concurrently recorded.\n\nWe present here a robust point-process Granger causality technique that overcome this problem by explicitly incorporating unobserved sources of variability into the model of neuronal spiking responses. In synthetic data sets, our new technique correctly recovered the underlying ground-truth functional connectivity between simulated units with a great degree of accuracy. Furthermore, its application to real neuronal recordings revealed many causal relationships between neurons as well as the temporal structure of their interactions.\n\nOur results suggest that our novel Granger causality method is robust and it can be used to study the flow of information in the spiking patterns of simultaneously recorded neurons even in presence of unobserved causes of temporal variability.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain damage (NHIBD) leads to cognitive and memory impairments, and there is no effective clinical treatment. Ferulic acid (FA) is found within members of the genus Angelica, reportedly shows protective effects on neuronal damage; however, the mechanism of the protective effects of FA on rats following NHIBD remains unclear. Using the Morris water maze task, we herein found that the impairment of spatial memory formation in adult rats exposed to NHIBD was significantly reversed by FA treatment and the administration of LNA-miR-9. RT-PCR analyses revealed that miRNA-9 was significantly increased in the hippocampus of neonatal rats and neuronal PC12 cells following NHIBD and that FA and LNA-miR-9 both inhibited the expression of miRNA-9, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of FA was mainly attributed to the inhibition of miRNA-9 expression. Indeed, the silencing of miR-9 by LNA-miR-9 or FA similarly attenuated neuronal damage and cerebral atrophy in the rat hippocampus after NHIBD, which was consistent with the restored expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Therefore, FA treatment may protect against neuronal death through the inhibition of miRNA-9 induction in the rat hippocampus following hypoxic-ischemic damage.",

    "abstract": "The food environment can interact with cognitive processing and influence eating behaviour. Our objective was to characterize the impact of implicit olfactory priming on inhibitory control towards food, in groups with different weight status. Ninety-two adults completed a modified Affective Shifting Task: they had to detect target stimuli and ignore distractor stimuli while being primed with non-attentively perceived odours. We measured reactivity and inhibitory control towards food pictures. Priming effects were observed on reactivity: participants with overweight and obesity were slower when primed with pear and pound cake odour respectively. Common inhibitory control patterns toward foods were observed between groups. We suggest that non-attentively perceived food cues influence bottom-up processing by activating distinguished mental representations according to weight status. Also, our data show that cognitive load influences inhibitory control toward foods. Those results contribute to understanding how the environment can influence eating behaviour in individuals with obesity.",

Mimics(R) software was used to derive total hippocampal volumes and total brain volumes from the MRI studies of 42 aging dogs ([&ge;] 9 years): 16 dogs diagnosed with CCD and 26 successfully aging controls. Total hippocampal volume normalized to total brain volume was significantly less for CCD patients compared with control dogs (p=0.04). The results of this study suggest that-similar to human AD-hippocampal atrophy is a pathological feature of CCD.

Ambient pH has been shown to be critical in different steps of Ggt life cycle such as survival in bulk soil, saprophytic growth, and pathogenicity on plants. There are however intra-specific variations and we previously found two types of Ggt strains that grow preferentially either at acidic pH or at neutral/alkaline pH; gene expression involved in pH-signal transduction pathway and pathogenesis was differentially regulated in two strains representative of these types. To go deeper in the description of the genetic pathways and the understanding of this adaptative mechanism, transcriptome sequencing was achieved on two strains (PG6 and PG38) which displayed opposite growth profiles in two pH conditions (acidic and neutral). PG6, growing better at acidic pH, overexpressed in this condition genes related to energy production and protein deubiquitination. In contrast, PG38, which grew better at neutral pH, overexpressed in this condition genes involved in fatty acids metabolism. This strain also expressed stress resistance mechanisms at both pH, to assert a convenient growth under various ambient pH conditions. These differences in metabolic pathway expression between strains at different pH might buffer the effect of field or soil variation in wheat fields, and explain the success of the pathogen.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionRoutine use of probiotics during antibiotic therapy in children remains a subject of discussion. To facilitate synthesis of individual study results and guideline formulation, it is important to assess predefined, similar, and clinically important outcomes. Core outcome sets are a proposed solution for this issue. Aim of this review was to document choice, design, and heterogeneity of outcomes in studies that assessed the effects of probiotics used for the prevention of antibiotic-associated adverse events in children.\n\nMethodsA systematic literature search covering three major databases was performed. Trials that evaluated oral probiotics use concomitant with antibiotic therapy in children were included. Data on outcome definitions, measurement instruments, and follow-up were extracted. The outcomes were assigned to predefined core areas and domains. Data were analyzed descriptively.\n\nResultsThirty-six trials were included in this review. Diarrhea, the most commonly reported outcome, had diagnostic criteria clearly defined only in 20 trials. In total, sixteen different definitions of diarrhea were identified. Diarrhea duration, severity and etiology were reported in 8, 4 and 6 studies, respectively. Nineteen studies assessed gastrointestinal symptoms other than diarrhea. Seven studies reported outcomes related to resource use or the economic impact of the intervention. Only 2 studies assessed outcomes related to life impact. None of the studies predefined adverse events of probiotic use.\n\nConclusionsIdentified outcomes were characterized by substantial heterogeneity. Majority of outcomes were not designed to evaluate endpoints of real-life relevance. Results from this review suggest the need for a new core outcome set consisting of outcomes important for decision-making.",

We find that compared to EC, Condoms, (plus Pap smear as control), LARC is mentioned less frequently than the others and 73% of schools have no LARC content on their SHC websites. There is no standardization in how the sexual and reproductive health information is organized on SHC websites, which might hinder access.

    "abstract": "Pathological pathways involved in the development of diabetic complications are still unclear. Several studies suggested a pathogenic role of C-peptide deficiency in vascular and neuropathic complications. However, to date, the role of C-peptide on diabetes-related bone loss has not been investigated. The objective of this study was to test the effects of a 6-week regimen of rat C-peptide infusion on bone by combining micro-CT imaging with histological testing.\n\nTwenty-three, four-month-old male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups: Normal control group; Sham diabetic control group; Diabetic plus C-peptide group. Diabetes was induced by injection of streptozotocin. Rat C-peptide was delivered via subcutaneously osmopumps. We assessed several trabecular microarchitectural parameters and cellular and matrix proteins in bone tissue sections.\n\nAt the end of the study, both the normal control and diabetic plus C-peptide groups had a higher tibia weight than the diabetic control group (p = 0.05 and p = 0.02, respectively). C-peptide levels significantly and positively correlated with the trabecular thickness (r= 0.45, p=0.08) and negatively with structure model index (r= -0.40, p=0.09). Furthermore, it positively correlated with one of the histological assessments (i.e. PLIN1 score; p=0.02). Micro-CT evaluation showed significant inter-group differences in trabecular thickness (p=0.02), trabecular space (p = 0.05) and cross-sectional thickness (p=0.05). Diabetic plus C-peptide group showed a higher trabecular thickness (p<0.001), cross-sectional thickness (p=0.03) and a lower trabecular space (p=0.05) than the normal control group. Both the normal control and diabetic plus C-peptide groups had more Runx-2 and PLIN1 positive cells in comparison to the diabetic control group (p = 0.045 and p = 0.034).\n\nFor the first time we demonstrated that the diabetic rats receiving rat C-peptide had higher quality of trabecular bone, than diabetic rats not receiving it.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe sterile insect technique (SIT) is a vector control strategy relying on the mass release of sterile males into wild vector populations. Current sex separation techniques are not fully efficient and could lead to the release of a small proportion of females. It is therefore important to evaluate the effect of irradiation on the ability of released females to transmit pathogens. This study aimed to assess the effect of irradiation on the survival and competence of Anopheles arabiensis females for Plasmodium falciparum in laboratory conditions.\n\nMethodsPupae were irradiated at 95 Gy, a sterilizing dose of gamma-rays from Caesium-137 source, and emerging adult females were challenged with one of 14 natural isolates of P. falciparum. Seven days post-bloodmeal (dpbm), irradiated and unirradiated-control females were dissected to assess the presence of oocysts. On 14 dpbm, oocyst rupture in mosquito midguts and sporozoite dissemination in head/thoraces were also examined. Two assays were performed to gauge the effect of irradiation on An. arabiensis survival. First, the survivorship of irradiated and unirradiated-control mosquitoes exposed to each parasite isolate was monitored. Second, how parasite infection and irradiation interact to influence mosquito lifespan was also assessed by including a group of uninfected unirradiated mosquitoes.\n\nResultsOverall, irradiation reduced the proportion of infected mosquitoes but this effect was inconsistent among parasite isolates. Second, there was no significant effect of irradiation on the number of developing oocysts. Third, the proportion of ruptured oocysts at 14 dpbm was higher in irradiated- than in control-unirradiated females, suggesting that irradiation might speed up parasite development. Fourth, irradiation had varying effects on female survival with either a negative effect (assay 1) or no effect (assay 2).\n\nConclusionCombining these effects into an epidemiological model could help quantifying the net effect of irradiation on malaria transmission in this system. Together, our data indicate that irradiated female An. arabiensis could contribute to malaria transmission, and highlight the need for perfect sexing tools which would prevent the release of females as part of SIT programs.",

    "abstract": "Culex erythrothorax Dyar is a West Nile virus (WNV) vector that breeds in wetland habitats with emergent vegetation. Urbanization and recreational activities near wetlands place humans and birds in close proximity to Cx. erythrothorax, increasing the risk of WNV transmission. High adult Cx. erythrothorax abundance peaked in a marsh bordering the San Francisco Bay of California (USA) during the first 3 hours after sunset (5527 {+/-} 4070 mosquitoes / trap night) during which adult mosquito control efforts are likely most effective. These adult mosquitoes were highly sensitive to permethrin, resmethrin, naled, and etofenprox insecticides when tested in a bottle bioassay (LC50 = 0.35, 0.68, 0.71, and 4.1 {micro}g/bottle, respectively). The synergist piperonyl butoxide increased the sensitivity of the mosquitoes to a low concentration of permethrin (0.5 {micro}g/bottle) while also reducing knock down time, but did not have similar effects with a higher permethrin concentration (2.0 {micro}g/bottle). Biochemical enzyme assays measuring bulk mixed-function oxidase, alpha-esterase, or beta-esterase activities in mosquito homogenates were significantly higher in Cx. erythrothorax relative to a strain of Culex pipiens that is sensitive to permethrin. Larvicide that was applied to the site had limited impact on reducing the abundance of adult Cx. erythrothorax. Subsequent removal of emergent vegetation in concert with reduced daily temperature in the environment substantially reduced Cx. erythrothorax abundance. Land managers who have a need to control Cx. erythrothorax in wetlands should consider vegetation removal over applying larvicide, while vector control agencies are likely to successfully control viremic Cx. erythrothorax that enter nearby neighborhoods by applying insecticides that target the adult stage of the mosquito within 3 h of sunset.",

    "abstract": "Pakistans total estimated snow leopard habitat is about 80,000 km2 of which about half is considered prime. However, this preliminary demarcation was not always in close agreement with the actual distribution--the discrepancy may be huge at the local and regional level. Recent technological developments like camera trapping and molecular genetics allow for collecting reliable presence records that could be used to construct realistic species distribution based on empirical data and advanced mathematical approaches like MaxEnt. Current study followed this approach to construct accurate distribution of the species in Pakistan. Moreover, movement corridors, among different landscapes, were also identified through the circuit theory. The habitat suitability map, generated from 384 presence points and 28 environmental variables, scored the snow leopards assumed range in Pakistan, from 0 to 0.97. A large shear of previously known range represented low-quality habitat, including areas in lower Chitral, Swat, Astore and Kashmir. Conversely, Khunjerab, Misgar, Chapursan, Qurumber, Broghil, and Central Karakoram represented high-quality habitats. Variables with higher contribution in the MaxEnt model were precipitation of driest month (34%), annual mean temperature (19.5%), mean diurnal range of temperature (9.8%), annual precipitation (9.4%) and river density (9.2). The validation texts suggest a good model fit, and strong prediction power.\n\nThe connectivity analysis revealed that the population in the Hindukush landscape appears to be more connected with the population in Afghanistan as compared to other populations in Pakistan. Similarly, the Pamir-Karakoram population is better connected with China and Tajikistan, while the Himalayan population was with the population in India.\n\nCurrent study allows for proposing three model landscapes to be considered under GSLEP agenda as regional priority areas, to safeguard safeguard future of the species in the long run. These landsacpes fall in mountain ranges of the Himalaya, Hindu Kush and Karakoram-Pamir, respectively. We also identified gaps in existing protected areas network, and suggest new protected areas in Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan to protect critical habitats of snow leopard in Pakistan.",
