    "abstract": "The family Natrialbaceae is a member of the class Halobacteria of the archaeal phylum Euryarchaeota. Seventeen genera with validly or effectively published names are currently included within this family. In this study, using pairwise average nucleotide identity and average amino acid identity comparisons in conjunction with phylogenetic analysis, it has been shown that the family Natrialbaceae is highly diverse and contains several potentially novel species and genera that are yet to be fully characterized. The deduced proteome sequence-based phylogenetic tree, constructed using the alignment- and parameter-free method CVTree3, contained six major clades, with Salinarchaeum sp. Harcht-Bsk1 being the only representative within clade 1. Furthermore, Haloterrigena daqingensis was found to be closely related to Natronorubrum sediminis, and it is proposed that these archaea together represent a novel genus. Interestingly, Haloterrigena jeotgali, Haloterrigena thermotolerans, and Natrinema pellirubrum were found to be very closely related to each other, and it is proposed that they be merged into a single species. Notably, the type genus Natrialba itself appeared to be heterogenous and contains species that could be broadly classified among two genera. Likewise, the genus Natrinema is also heterogenous and contains species that could be classified among six genera. Altogether, 19 novel genera have been proposed to be created, and four haloalkaliphilic archaea hitherto recognized only using genus names are confirmed to represent novel species.",

    "abstract": "Gold nanoparticle (AuNP) bioconjugates are increasingly being utilised in biomedicine due to their low toxicity on biological tissues and unique electronic and chemical properties. They have been utilised in several biological applications namely manufacture of nanomaterials, biosensing, electron microscopy and drug delivery systems. Particularly, immuno-assays often employ gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to enhance detection of a biological component. This paper presents a study on the bioconjugation of AuNPs with Horse Radish Peroxidase conjugated Human Papilloma Virus 16/18 Early 6 antibodies (CIP5) against Early 6 (E6) oncoprotein that is overexpressed in cervical carcinoma progression through physical adsorption. This bioconjugate can be employed in diagnostic immunoassay for cervical cancer screening. The study also demonstrated that the antibody pI, gold colloidal solution pH and amount of antibody determine the generation of stable Antibody-AuNPs bioconjugates.",

    "abstract": "Detailed genomic and structure-based analysis of a new coronavirus, namely 2019-nCoV, showed that the new virus is a new type of bat coronavirus and is genetically fairly distant from the human SARS coronavirus. Structure analysis of the spike (S) protein of this new virus showed that its S protein only binds weakly to the ACE2 receptor on human cells whereas the human SARS coronavirus exhibits strongly affinity to the ACE receptor. These findings suggest that the new virus does not readily transmit between humans and should theoretically not able to cause very serious human infection. These data are important to guide design of infection control policy and inform the public on the nature of threat imposed by 2019-nCov when results of direct laboratory tests on this virus are not expected to be available in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Chronic demyelination in the human CNS is characterized by an inhibitory microenvironment that impairs recruitment and differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) leading to failed remyelination and axonal atrophy. By network-based transcriptomics, we identified sulfatase 2 (Sulf2) mRNA in activated human primary OPCs. Sulf2, an extracellular endosulfatase, modulates the signaling microenvironment by editing the pattern of sulfation on heparan sulfate proteoglycans. We found that Sulf2 was increased in demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis and was actively secreted by human OPCs. In experimental demyelination, elevated OPC Sulf1/2 expression directly impaired progenitor recruitment and subsequent generation of oligodendrocytes thereby limiting remyelination. Sulf1/2 potentiates the inhibitory microenvironment by promoting BMP and WNT signaling in OPCs. Importantly, pharmacological sulfatase inhibition using PI-88 accelerated oligodendrocyte recruitment and remyelination by blocking OPC-expressed sulfatases. Our findings define an important inhibitory role of Sulf1/2 and highlight the potential for modulation of the heparanome in the treatment of chronic demyelinating disease.",

    "abstract": "Posttranscriptional repression by microRNA (miRNA) occurs through transcript destabilization or translation inhibition. Whereas RNA degradation explains most miRNA-dependent repression, transcript decay occurs co-translationally, raising questions regarding the requirement of target translation to miRNA-dependent transcript destabilization. To assess the contribution of translation to miRNA-mediated RNA destabilization, we decoupled these two molecular processes by dissecting the impact of miRNA loss of function on cytosolic long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We show, that despite interacting with miRNA loaded RNA-induced silencing complex (miRISC), the steady state abundance and degradation rates of these endogenously expressed non-translated transcripts are minimally impacted by miRNA loss. To validate the requirement of translation for miRNA-dependent decay, we fused a miRISC bound lncRNA, whose levels are unaffected by miRNAs, to the 3end of a protein-coding gene reporter and show that this results in its miRNA-dependent transcript destabilization. Furthermore, analysis of the few lncRNAs whose levels are regulated by miRNAs revealed these tend to associate with translating ribosomes and are likely misannotated micropeptides, further substantiating the necessity of target translation for miRNA-dependent transcript decay. Our analyses reveal the strict requirement of translation for miRNA-dependent transcript destabilization and demonstrate that the levels of coding and noncoding transcripts are differently affected by miRNAs.",

These marks are under the control of maternal effect proteins supplied in the oocyte. Here we report the epigenetic repressor Smchd1 as a novel maternal effect gene that regulates imprinted expression of 16 genes. Most Smchd1-sensitive genes only show loss of imprinting post-implantation, indicating maternal Smchd1s long-lived epigenetic effect. Sm-chd1-sensitive genes include both those controlled by germline polycomb marks and germline DNA methylation imprints; however, Smchd1 differs to other maternal effect genes that regulate the latter group, as Smchd1 does not affect germline DNA methylation imprints. Instead, Smchd1-sensitive genes are united by their reliance on polycomb-mediated histone methylation marks as germline or secondary imprints. We propose that Smchd1 translates these imprints to establish a heritable chromatin state required for imprinted expression later in development, revealing a new mechanism for maternal effect genes.",

    "abstract": "Protected areas are the cornerstones of global biodiversity conservation efforts1,2, but to fulfil this role they must be effective at conserving the ecosystems and species that occur within their boundaries. This is particularly imperative in tropical forest hotspots, regions that concentrate a major fraction of the worlds biodiversity while also being under intense human pressure3-5. But these areas strongly lack adequate monitoring datasets enabling to contrast biodiversity in protected areas with comparable unprotected sites6,7. Here we take advantage of the worlds largest citizen science biodiversity dataset - eBird8 - to quantify the extent to which protected areas in eight tropical forest biodiversity hotspots are effective at retaining bird diversity, and to understand the underlying mechanisms. We found generally positive effects of protection on the diversity of bird species that are forest-dependent, endemic to the hotspots, or threatened or Near Threatened, but not on overall bird species richness. Furthermore, we show that in most of the hotspots examined this is driven by protected areas preventing both forest loss and degradation. Our results support calls for increasing the extent and strengthening the management efforts within protected areas to reduce global biodiversity loss9-11.",

    "abstract": "Advances in digitized video-tracking and behavioral analysis have enabled accurate recording and quantification of mosquito flight and host-seeking behaviors, enabling development of Individual (agent) Based Models at much finer spatial scales than previously possible. We used such quantified behavioral parameters to create a novel virtual testing model, capable of accurately simulating indoor flight behavior by a virtual population of host-seeking mosquitoes as it interacts with and responds to simulated stimuli from a human-occupied bed net. We describe the model, including base mosquito behavior, state transitions, environmental representation and host stimulus representation. In the absence of a bed net and human bait, flight distribution of the model population is relatively uniform in the arena. Introducing an unbaited net induces a change in distribution due to landing events on the net surface, predominantly occurring on the sides and edges of the net. Presence of simulated human baited net strongly impacted flight distribution patterns, exploratory foraging, the number and distribution of net landing sites, depending on the bait orientation. As recorded in live mosquito experiments, contact with baited nets (a measure of exposure to the lethal insecticide) occurred predominantly on the top surface of the net. Number of net contacts and height of contacts decreased with increasing attractant dispersal noise. Results generated by the model are an accurate representation of actual mosquito behavior recorded at and around a human-occupied bed net in untreated and insecticide treated nets. In addition to providing insights into host-seeking behavior of endophilic vectors, this fine-grained model is highly flexible and has significant potential for in silico screening of novel bed net designs, accelerating the deployment of new and more effective tools for protecting against malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, dengue has been rapidly spreading and growing in the tropics and subtropics. Located in southern China, Hong Kongs subtropical monsoon climate may favour dengue vector populations and increase the chance of disease transmissions during the rainy summer season. An increase in local dengue incidence has been observed in Hong Kong ever since the first case in 2002, with an outbreak reaching historically high case numbers in 2018. However, the effects of seasonal climate variability on recent outbreaks are unknown. As the local cases were found to be spatially clustered, we developed a Poisson generalized linear mixed model using pre-summer monthly total rainfall and mean temperature to predict annual dengue incidence (the majority of local cases occur during or after the summer months), over the period 2002-2018 in three pre-defined areas of Hong Kong. Using leave-one-out cross-validation, 5 out of 6 observations of area-specific outbreaks during the major outbreak years 2002 and 2018 were able to be predicted. 42 out of a total of 51 observations (82.4%) were within the 95% confidence interval of the annual incidence predicted by our model. Our study found that the rainfall before and during the East Asian monsoon (pre-summer) rainy season is negatively correlated with the annual incidence in Hong Kong while the temperature is positively correlated. Hence, as mosquito control measures in Hong Kong are intensified mainly when heavy rainfalls occur during or close to summer, our study suggests that a lower-than-average intensity of pre-summer rainfall should also be taken into account as an indicator of increased dengue risk.",

    "abstract": "Many marine species are shifting their distribution poleward in response to climate change. The Barents Sea, as a doorstep to the fast-warming Arctic, is experiencing large scale changes in its environment and its communities. This paper aims at understanding what environmental predictors limit fish species habitats in the Barents Sea and discuss their possible evolution in response to the warming of the Arctic.\n\nSpecies distribution models usually aim at predicting the probability of presence or the average abundance of a species, conditional on environmental drivers. A complementary approach is to determine suitable habitats by modelling the upper limit of a species response to environmental factors. Using quantile regressions, we model the upper limit of biomass for 33 fish species in the Barents Sea in response to 10 environmental predictors. Boreal species are mainly limited by temperatures and most of them are expected to be able to expand their distribution in the Barents Sea when new thermally suitable habitats become available, in the limit of bathymetric constraints. Artic species are often limited by several predictors, mainly depth, bottom and surface temperature and ice cover, and future habitats are hard to predict qualitatively. Widespread species like the Atlantic cod are not strongly limited by the selected variables at the scale of the study, and current and future suitable habitats are harder to predict. These models can be used as input to integrative tools like end-to-end models on the habitat preference and tolerance at the species scale to inform resource management and conservation.",

    "abstract": "Voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels play a central role in the generation and propagation of action potentials in excitable cells such as neurons and muscles. To determine how the phenotypes of Nav-channel mutants are affected by other genes, we performed a forward genetic screen for dominant modifiers of the seizure-prone, gain-of-function Drosophila melanogaster Nav-channel mutant, paraShu. Our analyses using chromosome deficiencies, gene-specific RNA interference, and single-gene mutants revealed that a null allele of glutathione S-transferase S1 (GstS1) dominantly suppresses paraShu phenotypes. Reduced GstS1 function also suppressed phenotypes of other seizure-prone Nav-channel mutants, paraGEFS+ and parabss. Notably, paraShu mutants expressed 50% less GstS1 than wild-type flies, further supporting the notion that paraShu and GstS1 interact functionally. Introduction of a loss-of-function GstS1 mutation into a paraShu background led to up- and down-regulation of various genes, with those encoding cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes most significantly over-represented in this group. Because GstS1 is a fly ortholog of mammalian hematopoietic prostaglandin D synthase, and in mammals CYPs are involved in the oxygenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids including prostaglandins, our results raise the intriguing possibility that bioactive lipids play a role in GstS1-mediated suppression of paraShu phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Zinc cluster transcription factors are essential fungal specific regulators of gene expression. In the dimorphic pathogen Candida albicans, they control processes ranging from metabolism and stress adaptation to mating, virulence, and antifungal resistance. Here, we have identified the gene CaORF19.1604 as encoding a zinc cluster transcription factor that acts as a regulator of filament development. Hyperactivation of CaORF19.1604, which we have named RHA1 for Regulator of Hyphal Activity, leads to a wrinkled colony morphology under non-hyphal growth conditions, to pseudohyphal growth and filament formation, to invasiveness and enhanced biofilm formation. Cells with activated Rha1 are sensitive to cell wall modifying agents such as Congo red and the echinocandin drug caspofungin but show normal sensitivity to fluconazole. RNA-sequencing-based transcriptional profiling of the activated Rha1 strain reveals the up-regulation of genes for core filamentation and cell-wall-adhesion-related proteins such as Als1, Als3, Ece1, and Hwp1. Upregulation is also seen for the genes for the hyphal-inducing transcription factors Brg1 and Ume6 and genes encoding several enzymes involved in arginine metabolism, while downregulation is seen for the hyphal repressor Nrg1. The deletion of BRG1 blocks the filamentation caused by activated Rha1, while null mutants of UME6 result in a partial block. Deletion of RHA1 can partially reduce healthy hyphal development triggered by environmental conditions such as Spider medium or serum at 37{degrees}C.\n\nIn contrast to the limited effect of either single mutant, the double rha1 ume6 deletion strain is totally defective in both serum and Spider medium stimulated hyphal development. While the loss of Brg1 function blocks serum-stimulated hyphal development, this block can be significantly bypassed by Rha1 hyperactivity, and the combination of Rha1 hyperactivity and serum addition can generate significant polarization in even brg1 ume6 double mutants. Our results thus suggest that in response to external signals, Rha1 functions to facilitate the switch from an Nrg1 controlled yeast state to a Brg1/Ume6 regulated hyphal state.\n\nAuthor SummaryCandida albicans is the predominant human fungal pathogen, generating a mortality rate of 40% in systemically infected patients. The ability of Candida albicans to change its morphology is a determinant of its tissue penetration and invasion in response to variant host-related stimuli. The regulatory mechanism for filamentation includes a complex network of transcription factors that play roles in regulating hyphae associated genes. We identify here a new regulator of filamentation from the zinc cluster transcription factor family. We present evidence suggesting that this transcription factor assists the Nrg1/Brg1 switch regulating hyphal development.",

    "abstract": "Although several guidelines for best practices in EEG preprocessing have been released, even those studies that strictly adhere to those guidelines contain considerable variation in the ways that the recommended methods are applied. An open question for researchers is how sensitive the results of EEG analyses are to variations in preprocessing methods and parameters. To address this issue, we analyze the effect of preprocessing methods on downstream EEG analysis using several simple signal and event-related measures. Signal measures include recording-level channel amplitudes, study-level channel amplitude dispersion, and recording spectral characteristics. Event-related methods include ERPs and ERSPs and their correlations across methods for a diverse set of stimulus events. Our analysis also assesses differences in residual signals both in the time and spectral domains after blink artifacts have been removed. Using fully automated pipelines, we evaluate these measures across 17 EEG studies for two ICA-based preprocessing approaches (LARG, MARA) plus two variations of Artifact Subspace Reconstruction (ASR). Although the general structure of the results is similar across these preprocessing methods, there are significant differences, particularly in the low-frequency spectral features and in the residuals left by blinks. These results argue for detailed reporting of processing details as suggested by most guidelines, but also for using a federation of automated processing pipelines and comparison tools to quantify effects of processing choices as part of the research reporting.",

    "abstract": "The molecular processes underlying the ageing-related decline in cognitive performance and memory observed in humans are poorly understood. Studies in rodents have shown a decrease in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) that contain the GluN2B subunit in ageing synapses, and this decrease is correlated with impaired memory functions. However, the age-dependent contribution of GluN2B containing receptors to synaptic transmission in human cortical synapses has not been previously studied. We investigated the synaptic contribution of GluN2A and GluN2B containing NMDARs in adult human neurons using fresh non-pathological temporal cortical tissue resected during neurosurgical procedures. The tissue we obtained fulfilled quality criteria by the absence of inflammation markers and proteomic degradation. We show an age-dependent decline in the NMDA/AMPA receptor ratio in adult human temporal cortical synapses. We demonstrate that GluN2B containing NMDA receptors contribute to synaptic responses in the adult human brain with a reduced contribution in older individuals. With previous evidence demonstrating the critical role of synaptic GluN2B in regulating synaptic strength and memory storage in mice, this progressive reduction of GluN2B in the human brain during ageing may underlie a molecular mechanism in the age-related decline in cognitive abilities and memory observed in humans.",

    "abstract": "Mesopredators face interspecific competition and intraguild predation when sharing resources with apex predators or more dominant mesopredators. We theorize that mesopredators use a variety of tactics to avoid competitively dominant predators at shared locations, such as scavenging and communication sites, that provide a mix of risks and rewards to these smaller predators. We examined whether mesopredator species employed behavioural tactics to reduce risks from dominant pumas when exploiting resources. We monitored carcasses in the Santa Cruz Mountains, CA across a gradient of human development and treated half of the carcasses with puma sign. Bobcats visited treated carcasses significantly later and for less time. Contrary to our expectations, coyotes and grey foxes were more likely to visit treated carcasses, although foxes were significantly less likely to visit a carcass also used by coyotes. Bobcats and foxes were less likely to visit carcasses at higher development levels whereas raccoons exhibited the opposite pattern. At communication sites, we observed temporal segregation among mesopredators and pumas. Coyotes and small predators exhibited the most segregation, followed by coyotes and pumas, and raccoons and pumas. Our results suggest subordinate predators employ a combination of spatial and temporal avoidance to minimize competitive interactions at shared sites.",

    "abstract": "During particular stress conditions, transfer RNAs (tRNAs) become substrates of stress-induced endonucleases, resulting in the production of distinct tRNA-derived small RNAs (tsRNAs). These small RNAs have been implicated in a wide range of biological processes, but how isoacceptor and even isodecoder-specific tsRNAs act at the molecular level is still poorly understood. Importantly, stress-induced tRNA cleavage affects only a few tRNAs of a given isoacceptor or isodecoder, raising the question as to how such limited molecule numbers could exert measurable biological impact. While the molecular function of individual tsRNAs is likely mediated through association with other molecules, addressing the interactome of specific tsRNAs has only been attempted by using synthetic RNA sequences. Since tRNAs carry post-transcriptional modifications, tsRNAs are likely modified but the extent of their modifications remains largely unknown. Here, we developed a biochemical framework for the production and purification of specific tsRNAs using human cells. Preparative scale purification of tsRNAs from biological sources should facilitate experimentally addressing as to how exactly these small RNAs mediate the multitude of reported molecular functions.",

    "abstract": "The recent decline in honey bee (Hymenoptera: Apidae) colony health worldwide has had a significant impact on the beekeeping industry as well as on pollination-dependent crop sectors in North America and Europe. The pollinator crisis has been attributed to many environmental and anthropological factors including less nutrient rich agricultural monocultures, pesticide exposure, new parasite and pathogen infestations as well as beekeeper management and weather. Canadian beekeepers have indicated that issues with honey bee queens are the most significant factor affecting their colony health. In Canada, beekeepers manage colony losses by relying on the importation of foreign bees, particularly queens from warmer climates, to lead new replacement colonies. Unfortunately, the risks associated with imported queens include the introduction of new and potentially resistant pests and diseases, undesirable genetics including bees with limited adaptations to Canadas unique climate and bees negatively affected by transportation. Importing a large proportion of our queens each year also creates an unsustainable dependency on foreign bee sources, putting our beekeeping and pollination sectors at an even greater risk in the case of border closures and restrictions. Increasing the domestic supply of queens is one mitigation strategy that could provide Canadian beekeepers, farmers and consumers with a greater level of agricultural stability through locally bred, healthier queens. Our study is the first rigorous analysis of the economic feasibility of Canadian queen production. We present the costs of queen production for three case study operations across Canada over two years as well as the profitability implications. Our results show that for a small to medium sized queen production operation in Canada, producing queen cells and mated queens can be profitable. Using a mated queen market price ranging from $30 to $50, a producer selling mated queens could earn a profit of between $2 and $40 per queen depending on price and the cost structure of his operation. If the producer chose to rear queens for his own operation, the cost savings would also be significant as imported queen prices continue to rise. Our case studies reveal that there is potential for both skilled labour acquisition over time in queen production as well as cost savings from economies of scale. Our queen producers also reduced their production costs by re-using materials year to year. Domestic queen production could be one viable strategy to help address the current pollinator crisis in Canada.",

    "abstract": "To study brain function, preclinical research relies heavily on animal monitoring and the subsequent analyses of behavior. Commercial platforms have enabled semi high-throughput behavioral analyses by providing accurate tracking of animals, yet they often struggle with the analysis of ethologically relevant behaviors and lack the flexibility to adapt to variable testing environments. In the last couple of years, substantial advances in deep learning and machine vision have given researchers the ability to take behavioral analysis entirely into their own hands. Here, we directly compare the performance of commercially available platforms (Ethovision XT14, Noldus; TSE Multi Conditioning System, TSE Systems) to cross-verified human annotation. To this end, we provide a set of videos - carefully annotated by several human raters - of three widely used behavioral tests (open field, elevated plus maze, forced swim test). Using these data, we show that by combining deep learning-based motion tracking (DeepLabCut) with simple post-analysis, we can track animals in a range of classic behavioral tests at similar or even greater accuracy than commercial behavioral solutions. In addition, we integrate the tracking data from DeepLabCut with post analysis supervised machine learning approaches. This combination allows us to score ethologically relevant behaviors with similar accuracy to humans, the current gold standard, thus outperforming commercial solutions. Moreover, the resulting machine learning approach eliminates variation both within and between human annotators. In summary, our approach helps to improve the quality and accuracy of behavioral data, outperforming commercial systems at a fraction of the cost.",

Here we report the molecular mechanism behind an mechanostable protein complex responsible for resisting high shear forces and adhering bacteria to cellulose fibers in the human gut. Using single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS), single-molecule FRET (smFRET), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we resolved two binding modes and three unbinding reaction pathways of a mechanically ultrastable R. champanellensis (Rc) Dockerin-Cohesin (Doc-Coh) complex. The complex assembles in two discrete binding modes with significantly different mechanical properties, with one breaking at ~500 pN and the other at ~200 pN at loading rates from 1-100 nN/sec. A neighboring X-module domain allosterically regulates the binding interaction and inhibits one of the low-force pathways at high loading rates, giving rise to a new mechanism of catch bonding that manifests under force ramp protocols. Multi-state Monte Carlo simulations show strong agreement with experimental results, validating the proposed kinetic scheme. These results explain mechanistically how gut microbes regulate cell adhesion strength at high shear stress through intricate molecular mechanisms including dual-binding modes, mechanical allostery and catch bonds.",

    "abstract": "Due to their prominent role in development and infamy in cancer and HIV, the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand, CXCL12, have been the subject of numerous structural and functional studies. Nevertheless, a high resolution structure of the CXCR4-CXCL12 complex has not been reported. Even with several alternative computational models of the complex at hand, the relative contributions of different interaction epitopes to ligand binding, ligand selectivity and signaling are not readily apparent. Here, building upon our latest structural model, we employed a systematic mutagenesis strategy to dissect the functional anatomy of the of CXCR4-CXCL12 complex. Key charge swap mutagenesis experiments supported pairwise interactions between oppositely charged residues in the receptor and chemokine, confirming the accuracy of the predicted orientation of the chemokine relative to the receptor, while also providing insight into ligand selectivity. Progressive deletion of N-terminal residues revealed an unexpected contribution of the receptor N-terminus to chemokine signaling; this finding challenges a longstanding \"two-site\" hypothesis about the essential features of the receptor-chemokine interaction where the N-terminus is purported to only contribute to binding affinity. The results suggest that while the interaction of the chemokine N-terminus with the receptor binding pocket is the key driver of signaling, the signaling amplitude depends on the extent to which the receptor N-terminus binds the chemokine. Along with systematic characterization of other epitopes, the current data allow us to propose a comprehensive experimentally-consistent structural model for how the chemokine binds CXCR4 and initiates signal transmission through the receptor TM domain.\n\nOne sentence summaryA systematic structure-guided mutagenesis study of chemokine receptor CXCR4 reveals novel insights into epitopes regulating ligand recognition, ligand specificity and CXCL12-mediated signaling.",

    "abstract": "{gamma}-tubulin is a major protein involved in the nucleation of microtubules in all eukaryotes. It forms two different complexes with proteins of the GCP family (gamma-tubulin complex proteins): {gamma}-tubulin small complexes ({gamma}TuSCs), containing {gamma}-tubulin and GCPs 2 and 3, and {gamma}-tubulin ring complexes ({gamma}TuRCs), containing multiple {gamma}TuSCs, in addition to GCPs 4, 5, and 6. Whereas the structure and assembly properties of {gamma}TuSCs have been intensively studied, little is known about the assembly of {gamma}TuRCs, and about the specific roles of GCPs 4, 5, and 6. Here, we demonstrate that two copies of GCP4 and one copy each of GCP5 and GCP6 form a salt-resistant sub-complex within the {gamma}TuRC that assembles independently of the presence of {gamma}TuSCs. Incubation of this sub-complex with cytoplasmic extracts containing {gamma}TuSCs leads to the reconstitution of full-sized {gamma}TuRCs that are competent to nucleate microtubules. In addition, we investigate sequence extensions and insertions that are specifically found at the amino-terminus of GCP6, and between the GCP6 grip1 and grip2 motifs, and we demonstrate that these are involved in the assembly or stabilization of the {gamma}TuRC.\n\nSummary statement{gamma}-tubulin ring complexes are templates for microtubule nucleation, composed of {gamma}-tubulin and GCP proteins.

    "abstract": "Nester abundance is a key measure of the performance of the worlds largest green turtle rookery at Raine Island, Australia. Abundance surveys have been undertaken in waters adjacent to Raine Island reef using mark-resight counts by surface observer (SO), underwater video (UWV) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (since 1984, 2013 and 2016 respectively). UAV and UWV may provide more cost-effective and less biased alternatives, but estimates must be comparable with the historical estimates. Here we compare the three methods.\n\nThe relative likelihood of resighting a marked turtle was significantly higher by SO than the other methods, which led to lower mark-resight population estimates than by UAV or UWV. Most (96%) variation in resighting probabilities was associated with survey period, with comparatively little variation between consecutive days of sampling or time of day. This resulted in preliminary correction factors of 1.53 and 1.73 from SO-UWV and SO-UAV, respectively. However, the SO and UWV estimates were the most similar when turtle densities were the lowest, suggesting that correction factors need to take into account turtle density and that more data are required.\n\nWe hypothesise that the UAV and UWV methods improved detection rates of marked turtles because they allowed subsequent review and frame-by-frame analysis, thus reducing observer search error. UAVs were the most efficient in terms of survey time, personnel commitment and weather tolerance compared to the SO and UWV methods.\n\nThis study indicates that using UAVs for in-water mark-resight turtle abundance estimation is an efficient and accurate method that can provide an accurate adjustment for historical abundance estimates. Underwater video may continue to be useful as a backup alternative to UAV surveys.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional deformity of the spinal column in otherwise healthy adolescents. The underlying mechanisms associated with the spinal deformity development have been explored which delineated the role of the sagittal curvature of the spine. The patterns of the spinal deformity vary between the AIS patients as shown in several classification systems. It remains to further investigate how variations in sagittal profiles result in different coronal plane deformities in AIS and how these deformation patterns are intrinsically different.\n\nMethodsA total of 71 Lenke 1 and 52 Lenke 5 AIS patients were included retrospectively. The 3D models of the spine were generated from biplanar radiographs to calculate the clinical spinal parameters, vertebral axial rotations, and the 3D centerline of the spinal curvature. A classification based on the centerlines axial plane projection was developed. The 3D curvature of the centerline was calculated at each point. A 2D elastic rod finite element model (FEM) of the sagittal spinal curvature for each axial subtype was developed to calculate the 3D deformity of the spine under gravity and axial torsion. Differences in the axial clusters clinical parameters, curvature of the spine, and the deformation patterns of the FEM were compared. The characteristics of the sagittal curvature of these axial clusters were determined.\n\nResultsLenke1 was divided into two axial groups (I and II) whereas the Lenke 5 cohort all had the same axial projection pattern (loop shape). T5-T12 kyphosis was significantly different between Lenke1-Group I and the other two groups, p=0.04. The vertebral rotation in both Lenke1-Group I and Lenke 5 had only one maximum value and the FEM deformed in a loop shaped whereas Lenke1-group II showed two maximum values for vertebral rotation and the FEM of the centerline deformed in a lemniscate shape. The ratio of the spinal arc lengths above and below the sagittal inflection points for Lenke1-Groups I and II and Lenke 5 were 0.52, 1.16, and 3.24, respectively.\n\nConclusionVariations in the axial plane projection of the curve were observed within Lenke types. Lenke 1- Group I and Lenke 5 showed similar 3D curve characteristics suggesting one 3D curve whereas Lenke1-Group II, with two 3D curves, behaved differently. The length of the spinal arcs above and below the sagittal inflection point related to the patterns of axial deformity.",

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectiveDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations of the gene that encodes the protein dystrophin. Loss of dystrophin leads to severe and progressive muscle-wasting in both skeletal and heart muscles. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and their derivatives offer important opportunities to treat a number of diseases. Here, we investigated whether givinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), could reprogram hiPSCs into muscle progenitor cells (MPC) for DMD treatment.\n\nMethods and ResultsMPC generated by CHIR99021 and givinostat (Givi) small molecules from multiple hiPSCs expressed myogenic makers (Pax7, desmin) and were differentiated into myotubes expressing MF20 upon culture in specific differentiation medium. These MPC exhibited superior proliferation and migration capacity determined by CCK-8, colony and migration assays compared to control-MPC generated by CHIR99021 and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Upon transplantation in hind limb of Mdx/SCID mice with cardiotoxin (CTX) induced injury, these MPC showed higher engraftment and restoration of dystrophin than treatment with control-MPC and human myoblasts. In addition, treated muscle with these MPC showed significantly limited infiltration of inflammatory cells and reduced muscle necrosis and fibrosis. A number of these cells were engrafted under basal lamina expressing Pax7, which were capable of generating new muscle fibers after additional injury. Extracellular vesicles released from these cells promoted angiogenesis after reinjury.\n\nConclusionWe successfully generated integration free MPC from multiple hiPS cell lines using CHIR99021 and Givi. Givinostat induced MPC showed marked and impressive regenerative capabilities and restored dystrophin in injured tibialis muscle compared to control MPC. Additionally, MPC generated by Givi also seeded the stem cell pool in the treated muscle. It is concluded that hiPSCs pharmacologically reprogrammed into MPC with a small molecule, Givi with anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and muscle gene promoting properties might be an effective cellular source for treatment of muscle injury and restoration of dystrophin in DMD.",

    "abstract": "Ecosystem effects of bottom trawl fisheries are a major concern. We analysed whether the replacement of mechanical stimulation by electrical stimulation may reduce the adverse impacts on the benthic ecosystem in the beam trawl fishery for sole. Although the use of electricity is not allowed to catch fish in European Union waters, a number of beam trawlers got derogation and switched to pulse trawling to explore the potential to reduce impacts. We extended a recently developed assessment framework and showed that the switch to pulse trawling substantially reduced benthic impacts when exploiting the Total Allowable Catch of sole in the North Sea. We applied the framework to Dutch beam trawl logbook data from 2009 to 2017 and estimated that the trawling footprint decreased by 23%; the precautionary impact indicator of the benthic community decreased by 39%; the impact on median longevity decreased by 20%; the impact on benthic biomass decreased by 61%; the amount of sediment mobilised decreased by 39%. The decrease is due to the replacement of tickler chains by electrode arrays, a lower towing speed and higher catch efficiency for sole. The effort and benthic impact of the beam trawl fishery targeting plaice Pleuronectes platessa in the central North Sea increased with the recovery of the plaice stock. This study illustrates the usefulness of a standardized methodological framework to assess the differences in time trends and trawling impact between gears.",

    "abstract": "Many genes whose mutations cause, or increase the risk of, Parkinsons disease (PD) have been identified. An inactivating mutation (R258Q) in the Sac inositol phosphatase domain of synaptojanin 1 (SJ1/PARK20), a phosphoinositide phosphatase implicated in synaptic vesicle recycling, results in PD. The gene encoding Sac2/INPP5F, another Sac domain containing protein, was identified as a PD risk locus by GWAS. Knock-In mice carrying the SJ1 patient mutation (SJ1RQKI) exhibit PD features, while Sac2 knockout mice (Sac2KO) do not have obvious neurological defects. We report a \"synthetic\" effect of the SJ1 mutation and the KO of Sac2 in mice. Most mice with both mutations died perinatally. The occasional survivors had stunted growth, died within 3 weeks, and showed abnormalities of striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals at an earlier stage than SJ1RQKI mice. The abnormal accumulation of endocytic factors observed at synapses of cultured SJ1RQKI neurons was more severe in double mutant. Our results suggest that SJ1 and Sac2 have partially overlapping functions and are consistent with a potential role of Sac2 as a PD risk gene.",

Despite implementation on 300 keV cryo-EM instruments, it remains unknown how well beam-image shift data collection affects data quality on 200 keV instruments and how much aberrations can be computationally corrected. To test this, we collected and analyzed a cryo-EM dataset of aldolase at 200 keV using beam-image shift. This analysis shows that beam tilt on the instrument initially limited the resolution of aldolase to 4.9[A]. After iterative rounds of aberration correction and particle polishing in RELION, we were able to obtain a 2.8[A] structure. This analysis demonstrates that software correction of microscope aberrations can provide a significant improvement in resolution at 200 keV.",

    "abstract": "The translocator protein (TSPO), previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, is of longstanding medical interest as both a biomarker for neuroinjury and a potential drug target for neuroinflammation and other disorders. Recently it was shown that ligand residence time is a key factor determining steroidogenic efficacy of TSPO-binding compounds. This spurs interest in simulations of (un)binding pathways of TSPO ligands, which could reveal the molecular interactions governing ligand residence time. In this study, we use a weighted ensemble algorithm to determine the unbinding pathway for different poses of PK-11195, a TSPO ligand used in neuroimaging. In contrast with previous studies, our results show that PK-11195 does not dissociate directly into the solvent but instead dissociates via the lipid membrane by going between the transmembrane helices. We analyze this path ensemble in detail, constructing descriptors that can facilitate a general understanding of membrane-mediated ligand binding. We construct a Markov state model using additional straightforward simulations to determine pose stability and kinetics of ligand unbinding. Together we combine over 40 {micro}s of trajectory data to form a coherent picture of the ligand binding landscape. We find that all poses are able to interconvert before unbinding, leading to single mean first passage time estimate for all starting poses which roughly agrees with the experimental quantity. The ligand binding transition state predicted by our combined model occurs when PK-11195 is already in the membrane and does not involve direct ligand-protein interactions. This has implications for the design of new long residence-time TSPO ligands.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEKinetics-oriented drug design is an emerging objective in drug discovery. However, while ligand binding affinity (or the binding free energy) is purely a function of the bound and unbound states, the binding kinetics depends on the nature of the paths by which the (un)binding occurs. This underscores the importance of approaches that can reveal information about the ensemble of (un)binding paths. Here we used advanced molecular dynamics approaches to study the unbinding of PK-11195 from TSPO and find it dissociates from the protein by dissolving into the membrane, and that the transition state occurs after the PK-11195 molecule has already separated from TSPO. These results motivate the design of future long-residence time TSPO ligands that destabilize the membrane-solvated transition state.",

    "abstract": "The epidermis is a stratified epithelium in which structural and functional features are polarized across multiple cell layers. This type of polarity is essential for establishing the epidermal barrier, but how it is created and sustained is poorly understood. Previous work identified a role for the classical cadherin/filamentous-actin network in establishment of epidermal polarity. However, little is known about potential roles of the most prominent epidermal intercellular junction, the desmosome, in establishing epidermal polarity, in spite of the fact that desmosome constituents are patterned across the apical to basal cell layers. Here, we show that desmosomes and their associated intermediate filaments (IF) are key regulators of mechanical polarization in epidermis, whereby basal and suprabasal cells experience different forces that drive layer-specific functions. Uncoupling desmosomes and IF or specific targeting of apical desmosomes through depletion of the superficial desmosomal cadherin, desmoglein 1, impedes basal stratification in an in vitro competition assay and suprabasal tight junction barrier functions in 3D reconstructed epidermis. Surprisingly, disengaging desmosomes from IF also accelerated the expression of differentiation markers, through precocious activation of the mechanosensitive transcriptional regulator serum response factor (SRF) and downstream activation of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor family member ErbB2 by Src family kinase (SFK) mediated phosphorylation. This Dsg1-SFK-ErbB2 axis also helps maintain tight junctions and barrier function later in differentiation. Together, these data demonstrate that the desmosome-IF network is a critical contributor to the cytoskeletal-adhesive machinery that supports the polarized function of the epidermis.",

    "abstract": "Securing economically and ecologically significant molluscs, as our oceans warm and acidify due to climate change, is a global priority. South eastern Australia receives warm water in a strengthening East Australia Current and so resident species are vulnerable to elevated temperature and marine heat waves. This study tested whether oysters pre exposed to elevated temperature or heat stress enhances resilience to ocean warming later in life. Two Australian species, the flat oyster, Ostrea angasi, and the Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, were given a mild dose of warm water or \"heat shock\" stress in the laboratory and then transferred to elevated temperature conditions where we used the thermal outfall from power generation as a proxy to investigate the impacts of ocean warming. Shell growth, condition index, lipid content and profile and survival of oysters was impacted by elevated temperature in the field, with flat oysters being more impacted than Sydney rock oysters. Flat oysters grew faster than Sydney rock oysters at ambient temperature, but were more sensitive to elevated temperature. Early exposure to heat stress did little to ameliorate the negative effects of increased temperature, although the survival of heat shocked flat oysters was greater than non-heat shocked oysters. Further investigations are required to determine if early exposure to heat stress can act to inoculate oysters to future stress and overall enhance resilience of oysters to ocean warming.",

    "abstract": "The neural circuits responsible for behavior remain largely unknown. Previous efforts have reconstructed the complete circuits of small animals, with hundreds of neurons, and selected circuits for larger animals. Here we (the FlyEM project at Janelia and collaborators at Google) summarize new methods and present the complete circuitry of a large fraction of the brain of a much more complex animal, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Improved methods include new procedures to prepare, image, align, segment, find synapses, and proofread such large data sets; new methods that define cell types based on connectivity in addition to morphology; and new methods to simplify access to a large and evolving data set. From the resulting data we derive a better definition of computational compartments and their connections; an exhaustive atlas of cell examples and types, many of them novel; detailed circuits for most of the central brain; and exploration of the statistics and structure of different brain compartments, and the brain as a whole. We make the data public, with a web site and resources specifically designed to make it easy to explore, for all levels of expertise from the expert to the merely curious. The public availability of these data, and the simplified means to access it, dramatically reduces the effort needed to answer typical circuit questions, such as the identity of upstream and downstream neural partners, the circuitry of brain regions, and to link the neurons defined by our analysis with genetic reagents that can be used to study their functions.\n\nNote: In the next few weeks, we will release a series of papers with more involved discussions. One paper will detail the hemibrain reconstruction with more extensive analysis and interpretation made possible by this dense connectome. Another paper will explore the central complex, a brain region involved in navigation, motor control, and sleep. A final paper will present insights from the mushroom body, a center of multimodal associative learning in the fly brain.",
