    "abstract": "The transmission dynamics of arboviruses like Zika virus (ZIKV) are most often evaluated by vector competence and the related extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which represent the proportion of vectors that become infectious given exposure and the time it takes for a vector to become infectious given exposure, respectively. Thus, EIP is the temporality of vector competence, and these measures have been used to evaluate the relative fitness of arbovirus systems. However, another temporal process critical to assessing arbovirus transmission dynamics is the age-structure of vector populations, as studies have demonstrated how vector mortality interplays with vector competence and EIP to alter transmission system efficiency. These and other parameters are critical to vectorial capacity (VC), a measure of transmission potential of a vector-pathogen system. However, how these three components - EIP, vector competence, and age - affect VC still needs to be addressed. We first compared experimentally how vector competence/EIP and mosquito age at the time of infection acquisition (Ageacquisition) interacted in an Aedes aegypti-ZIKV model system. We found that Ageacquisition did not alter the vector competence/EIP using traditional analyses, except in the context of mortality. To capture and quantify this age-dependent context, we developed an age-structured vectorial capacity framework (VCage) by experimentally determining daily mortality and probability of biting, as well as vector competence/EIP parameterized as EIPMin and EIPMax. Like previous studies, we found that arbovirus phenotypes leading to outbreaks are not straightforward and may follow a tortoise and the hare (TotH), whereby slow and steady is as or better than fast and furious phenotypes. Understanding the contributions of these age-dependent life traits as well as VCage allows for quantification and visualization of both the magnitude and temporality of transmission dynamics in an age-dependent manner, which reveals this TotH model that should change how compare and rank arbovirus phenotypes, and perhaps even how we identify  highly or  negligibly competent vectors.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the chromosomal rearrangements between species can inform our understanding of genome evolution, reproductive isolation, and speciation. Here we present a novel algorithm for identifying regions of synteny in pairs of genetic maps, which is implemented in the accompanying R package, syntR. The syntR algorithm performs as well as previous ad-hoc methods while being systematic, repeatable, and is applicable to mapping chromosomal rearrangements in any group of species. In addition, we present a systematic survey of chromosomal rearrangements in the annual sunflowers, which is a group known for extreme karyotypic diversity. We build high-density genetic maps for two subspecies of the prairie sunflower, Helianthus petiolaris ssp. petiolaris and H. petiolaris ssp. fallax.\n\nUsing syntR, and we identify blocks of synteny between these two subspecies and previously published high-density genetic maps. We reconstruct ancestral karyotypes for annual sunflowers using those synteny blocks and conservatively estimate that there have been 7.9 chromosomal rearrangements per million years - a high rate of chromosomal evolution. Although the rate of inversion is even higher than the rate of translocation in this group, we further find that every extant karyotype is distinguished by between 1 and 3 translocations involving only 8 of the 17 chromosomes. This non-random exchange suggests that specific chromosomes are prone to translocation and may thus contribute disproportionately to widespread hybrid sterility in sunflowers. These data deepen our understanding of chromosome evolution and confirm that Helianthus has an exceptional rate of chromosomal rearrangement that may facilitate similarly rapid diversification.",

    "abstract": "Fluvial dynamics are driven by multiple environmental factors and scales. Studies coupling hydrological and nutrient dynamics of Andean streams are almost nonexistent. We characterized two adjacent streams with contrasting drainage basins: Casa de Piedra, originating in a small mountain lake and running through a pristine landscape, and Gutierrez, originating in a large piedmont lake and running through an anthropized landscape. Despite both drainage basins sharing geology and climate, we found that the streams presented contrasting hydrological and nutrient dynamics. Casa de Piedra had higher discharge flashiness with shorter response delays to precipitation. Interestingly, Gutierrezs hydrology was buffered by the upstream lake, but its nutrient exports were not. Differences observed in quality and timing of coarse particulate organic matter export and basal export levels of phosphorus and nitrogen could be explained by human activities affecting Gutierrez but not Casa de Piedra. Moreover, nitrogen:phosphorus ratio indicates a possible future shift to phosphorus as the limiting nutrient as Andean basins become more densely populated. In summary, our annual basis study shows that even under a common geology and climate, stream dynamics of adjacent basins can be starkly different due to differences in topography and land use.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome profiling by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been widely used to characterize cellular status but it relies on second strand cDNA synthesis to generate initial material for library preparation. Here we use bacterial transposase Tn5, which has been increasingly used in various high-throughput DNA analyses, to construct RNA-seq libraries without second strand synthesis. We show that Tn5 transposome can randomly bind RNA/DNA heteroduplexes and add sequencing adapters onto RNA directly after reverse transcription. This method, Sequencing HEteRo RNA-DNA-hYbrid (SHERRY), is versatile and scalable. SHERRY accepts a wide range of starting materials, from bulk RNA to single cells. SHERRY offers a greatly simplified protocol, and produces results with higher reproducibility and GC uniformity compared with prevailing RNA-seq methods.\n\nSignificance StatementRNA sequencing is widely used to measure gene expression in biomedical research; therefore, improvements in the simplicity and accuracy of the technology are desirable. All existing RNA sequencing methods rely on the conversion of RNA into double-stranded DNA through reverse transcription followed by second strand synthesis. The latter step requires additional enzymes and purification, and introduces sequence-dependent bias. Here, we show that Tn5 transposase, which randomly binds and cuts double-stranded DNA, can directly fragment and prime the RNA/DNA heteroduplexes generated by reverse transcription. The primed fragments are then subject to PCR amplification. This provides a new approach for simple and accurate RNA characterization and quantification.",

    "abstract": "Transient Receptor Potential Ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a non-selective cation channel, which is broadly expressed throughout the body. Despite its expression in the mammalian cortex, little is known about the contribution of TRPA1 to cortical function. Here we investigate the role of TRPA1 in sensory information processing by performing electrophysiological recording and 2-photon calcium imaging from two sensory areas in mice: the primary vibrissal somatosensory cortex (vS1) and the primary visual cortex (V1). In vS1, local activation of TRPA1 by its agonist AITC significantly increased the spontaneous activity of cortical neurons, their evoked response to vibrissal stimulation, and their response range, consistent with a positive gain modulation. TRPA1 inhibition with HC-030031 reversed these modulations to below initial control gains. The gain modulations were absent in TRPA1 Knockout mice. In V1, TRPA1 activation increased the gain of direction and orientation selectivity similarly to the gain modulations observed in vS1 cortex. Linear decoding analysis of V1 population activity confirmed faster and more reliable encoding of visual signals in the presence of TRPA1 activation. Overall, our findings reveal a physiological role for TRPA1 in enhancing sensory signals in the mammalian cortex.",

    "abstract": "Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are prevalent across the tree of life and regulate nearly all aspects of cellular functions by catalyzing synthesis of glycosidic linkages between diverse donor and acceptor substrates. Despite the availability of GT sequences from diverse organisms, the evolutionary basis for their complex and diverse modes of catalytic and regulatory functions remain enigmatic. Here, based on deep mining of over half a million GT-A fold sequences from diverse organisms, we define a minimal core component shared among functionally diverse enzymes. We find that variations in the common core and the emergence of hypervariable loops extending from the core contributed to the evolution of catalytic and functional diversity. We provide a phylogenetic framework relating diverse GT-A fold families for the first time and show that inverting and retaining mechanisms emerged multiple times independently during the course of evolution. We identify conserved modes of donor and acceptor recognition in evolutionarily divergent families and pinpoint the sequence and structural features for functional specialization. Using the evolutionary information encoded in primary sequences, we trained a machine learning classifier to predict donor specificity with nearly 88% accuracy and deployed it for the annotation of understudied GTs in five model organisms. Our studies provide an evolutionary framework for investigating the complex relationships connecting GT-A fold sequence, structure, function and regulation.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis, the leading cause of death in cancer patients, requires the invasion of tumor cells through the stroma in response to migratory cues, such as those provided by the extracellular matrix (ECM). Recent advances in proteomics have led to the identification of hundreds of ECM proteins which are more abundant in tumors relative to healthy tissue. Our goal was to develop a pipeline to easily predict which of these ECM proteins is more likely to have an effect on cancer invasion and metastasis. We evaluated the effect of 4 ECM proteins upregulated in breast tumor tissue in multiple human breast cancer cell lines in 3 assays. We found there was no linear relationship between the 11 cell shape parameters we quantified when cells adhere to ECM proteins and 2D cell migration speed, persistence or 3D invasion. We then used classifiers and partial-least squares regression analysis to identify which metrics best predicted ECM-driven 2D migration and 3D invasion responses. ECM-driven 2D cell migration speed or persistence did not correlate with or predict 3D invasion in response to that same cue. However, cell adhesion, and in particular cell elongation and irregularity accurately predicted the magnitude of ECM-driven 2D migration and 3D invasion in all cell lines. Testing predictions revealed that our models are good at predicting the effect of novel ECM proteins within a given cell line, but that ECM responses are cell-line specific. Overall, our studies identify the cell morphological features that determine 3D invasion responses to individual ECM proteins. This platform will help provide insight into the functional role of ECM proteins abundant tumor tissue and help prioritize strategies for targeting tumor-ECM interactions to treat metastasis.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health [R00-CA207866-04 to M.J.O.]; Tufts University [Start-up funds from the School of Engineering to M.J.O.] and funds from NSF REU to A.W.\n\nConflict-of-interest: None.\n\nInsight BoxMetastasis, the dissemination of tumor cells, is driven by the interaction of invading tumor cells with their local environment, in particular with the ECM, which provides structure and support to our tissues. This study presents an integrated approach to predict the effect of individual ECM proteins on 3D invasion and metastasis based on simple adhesion assays which quantify cell shape. Machine learning classification and partial-least squares regression models reveal that ECM-driven 2D cell migration metrics are not predictive of 3D invasion, and that cell shape of cells adhered to ECM can predict that proteins effect on 3D invasion. These data provide a pipeline for predicting the effect of ECM proteins on breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Plus-end tracking proteins (+TIPs) are a group of proteins that associate with the growing end of microtubules and mediate important cellular functions including neural development and cell division. Work in recent years has shown that the majority of +TIPs are directed to the plus-end through a family of end binding proteins (EBs), which preferentially bind the stabilizing cap of GTP-tubulin present during microtubule growth, versus weaker binding to GDP-tubulin in the proximal microtubule. One question yet to be addressed is whether there may exist other microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) that preferentially bind specific nucleotide states of tubulin. Here we report that the neuronal MAP tau, which is enriched in axons where it promotes microtubule growth and bundling, preferentially binds GDP-tubulin (KD = 0.26 {micro}M) over GMPCPP-tubulin (KD = 1.1 {micro}M) in vitro as well as GTP-tubulin at the tips of growing microtubules in vitro and in vivo. This nucleotide preference causes tau binding to lag behind the growing microtubule plus-end by about 100-200 nm both in vitro and in live cells. Thus, tau is a microtubule tip avoiding protein, establishing a new class of tip avoiding MAPs, and acts primarily by suppressing microtubule shortening rather than promoting growth. We speculate that neurological disease-relevant tau mutations may exert their phenotype by their failure to properly recognize GDP-tubulin, thus displacing +TIPs, such as EB3, and their associated activities into abnormal locations in the neuron.",

    "abstract": "Pleural empyema is an inflammatory condition characterized by accumulation of pus inside the pleural cavity, which is usually followed by bacterial pneumonia. During the disease process, the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines in the purulent pleural effusion cause proliferation of fibroblasts and deposition of extracellular matrix, which lead to fibrin deposition and fibrothorax. Urokinase instillation therapy through a chest drainage tube is frequently used for fibrinolysis in patients with empyema. However, urokinase treatment requires multiple instillation (2-3 times per day, for 4-8 days) and easily flows out from the chest drainage tube due to its high water solubility. In this in vitro study, we developed a thermo-responsive hydrogel based on poloxamer 407 (P407) combined with hyaluronic acid (HA) for optimal loading and release of urokinase. Our results show that the addition of HA to poloxamer gels provides a significantly more compact microstructure, with smaller pore sizes (**p < 0.001). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profile revealed no influence on the micellization intensity of poloxamer gel by HA. The 25% poloxamer-based gel was significantly superior to the 23% poloxamer-based gel, with slower gel erosion when comparing the 16th hour residual gel weight of both gels (*p < 0.05; **p < 0.001). The 25% poloxamer-HA gel also exhibited a superior urokinase release profile and longer release time. A Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) study of the P407/HA hydrogel showed no chemical interactions between P407 and HA in the hydrogel system. The thermoresponsive P407/HA hydrogel may have a promising potential in the loading and delivery of hydrophilic drugs. On top of that, in vitro toxicity test of this combination demonstrates a lower toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Homeostasis is an essential concept to understand the stability of organisms and their adaptive behaviors when coping with external and internal assaults. Many hormones that take part in homeostatic control come in antagonistic pairs, such as glucagon and insulin reflecting the inflow and outflow compensatory mechanisms to control a certain internal variable, such as blood sugar levels. By including negative feedback loops homeostatic controllers can exhibit oscillations with characteristic frequencies. In this paper we demonstrate the associated frequency changes in homeostatic systems when individual controllers in a set of interlocked feedback loops gain control in response to environmental changes. Taking p53 as an example, we show how the Per2, ATM and Mdm2 feedback loops -interlocked with p53-gain individual control in dependence to DNA damage and how each of these controllers provide certain functionalities in their regulation of p53. In unstressed cells, the circadian regulator Per2 ensures a basic p53 level to allow its rapid up-regulation in case of DNA damage. When DNA damage occurs the ATM controller increases the level of p53 and defends it towards uncontrolled degradation, which despite DNA damage, would drive p53 to lower values and p53 dysfunction. Mdm2 on its side keeps p53 at a maximum level to avoid premature apoptosis. However, with on-going DNA damage the Mdm2 set-point is increased by HSP90 and other p53 stabilizers leading finally to apoptosis. An essential aspect in p53 regulation at occurring cell stress is the coordinated inhibition of ubiquitin-independent and ubiquitin-dependent degradation reactions and the increasing stabilizing mechanisms of p53. Whether oscillations serve a function or are merely a by-product of the controllers are discussed in view of the finding that homeostatic control of p53, as indicated above, does in principle not require oscillatory homeostats.",

    "abstract": "While studies of ATG genes in knockout models led to an explosion of knowledge about the functions of autophagy components, the exact roles of LC3/GABARAP proteins are still poorly understood. A major drawback for their understanding is that the available interactome data was largely acquired using overexpression systems. To overcome these limitations, we employed CRISPR/Cas9-based genome-editing to generate a panel of cells in which human ATG8 genes were tagged at their natural chromosomal locations with an N-terminal affinity epitope. This cellular resource was exemplarily employed to map endogenous GABARAPL2 protein complexes in response to autophagic modulation using interaction proteomics. This approach identified the ER transmembrane protein and lipid droplet biogenesis factor ACSL3 as a stabilizing GABARAPL2-binding partner. Through this interaction, the GABARAPL2-interacting protein and UFM1-activating enzyme UBA5 becomes anchored at the ER membrane. Functional analysis unveiled ACSL3 and lipid droplet formation as novel regulators of the enigmatic UFM1 conjugation pathway.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) constitute a monolayer that covers the interior surface of blood vessels and participates in various processes. Although vascular ECs share certain common properties, they differ in both structure and function. So far, the transcriptome profile and heterogeneity of the full repertoire of ECs in vertebrates remain poorly understood. The relatively small size of zebrafish embryos and larvae allows a feasible analysis of the broad spectrum of ECs within every tissue and organ of a whole organism. ECs have been suggested to be conditional innate immune cells. Whether ECs possess the comparable capacity of involvement in immune response is so far undetermined. Currently, through single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of total ECs of zebrafish we identified a fraction of endothelial cells expressing the marker genes of innate immune cells, named \"endoimmune cells\". We found the percentage of these cells gradually increased along with the embryonic development. Then, we observed the patrolling mCherry+ cells displayed the morphology alike to the macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, we revealed that some of the kdrl:ras-mCherry ECs were labelled with coro1a:EGFP as well. In addition, we demonstrated that the mCherry+ EC from intersegmental vessel could gradually present the expression of GFP in Tg(kdrl:ras-mCherry::coro1a:GFP) line, suggesting the endoimmune cells are derived from ECs. Importantly, we showed the endoimmune cells are responsive to the inflammation in zebrafish. Taken together, these data suggested the existence of endoimmune cells, a novel type of subpopulations of ECs. It will provide novel insights for understanding endothelial roles in both normal physiological function and human diseases and enable endoimmune cells-based target therapies.",

    "abstract": "Rotavirus causes severe diarrheal disease in children by broadly dysregulating intestinal homeostasis. However, the underlying mechanism(s) of rotavirus-induced dysregulation remains incompletely characterized. Here we show that rotavirus-infected cells produce paracrine signals that manifest as intercellular calcium waves (ICWs); which are observed in both cell lines and human intestinal enteroids. Rotavirus ICWs are caused by the release of extracellular adenosine diphosphate (ADP) that activates P2Y1 purinergic receptors on neighboring cells and are blocked by P2Y1 antagonists or CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of P2Y1. Blocking the paracrine ADP signal reduces rotavirus replication, inhibits rotavirus-induced serotonin release and fluid secretion, and reduces diarrhea severity in neonatal mice. This is the first evidence that viruses exploit ICWs to amplify diarrheal signaling; a finding which has broad implications for gastrointestinal physiology.\n\nSummaryRotavirus triggers the extracellular release of ADP from infected cells to dysregulate nearby uninfected cells and activate pro-disease pathways.",

    "abstract": "Nature provides a number of mechanisms to encode dynamic information in biomolecules. In metazoans, there exist rare chemical modifications that occur through entirely unique mechanistic regimes. One such example occurs in the Hedgehog (Hh) morphogens, proteins singular across all domains of life for the nature of their covalent ligation to cholesterol. The isoform- and context-specific efficiency of the ligation reaction has profound impact on the activity of Hh morphogens and represents an unexplored aspect of Hh ligand-dependent cancers. To elucidate the chemical mechanism of this modification, we have defined roles of the uncharacterized sterol recognition region (SRR) in Hh proteins. We use a combination of sequence conservation, directed mutagenesis, and biochemical assays to specify residues of the SRR that are responsible for cellular and biochemical processes in Hh cholesterolysis. Our investigations offer the first functional template of this region, providing opportunities to identify parallel reactivity in nature and revealing new mechanisms that can be exploited as tools in chemical biology.",

    "abstract": "Unrepaired DNA damage during embryonic development can be potentially inherited by a large population of cells. However, the quality control mechanisms that minimize the contribution of damaged cells to developing embryos remain poorly understood.\n\nHere, we uncovered an ATR- and CHK1-mediated transcriptional response to replication stress (RS) in ESCs that induces genes expressed in totipotent two-cell (2C) stage embryos and 2C-like cells. This response is mediated by Dux, a multicopy retrogene defining the cleavage-specific transcriptional program in placental mammals. In response to RS, DUX triggers the transcription of 2C-like markers such as murine endogenous retrovirus-like elements (MERVL) and Zscan4. This response can also be elicited by ETAA1-mediated ATR activation in the absence of RS. ATR-mediated activation of DUX requires GSRF1 dependent post-transcriptional regulation of Dux mRNA. Strikingly, activation of ATR expands ESCs fate potential by extending their contribution to both embryonic and extra{-}embryonic tissues. These findings define a novel ATR dependent pathway involved in maintaining genome stability in developing embryos by controlling ESCs fate in response to RS.",

Here, we report in the Drosophila follicular epithelium a developmentally regulated and evolutionarily conserved process,  patency, wherein a breach is created in the epithelium at tricellular contacts during mid-vitellogenesis. In Drosophila, patency exhibits a strict temporal range delimited by the transcription factor Tramtrack69, and a spatial pattern regulated by the dorsal-anterior signals of the follicular epithelium. Crucial for lipid uptake by the oocyte, patency is also exploited by endosymbionts such as Spiroplasma pulsonii.

    "abstract": "The physical dimensions of proteins and glycans on cell surfaces can critically affect cell function, for example by preventing close contact between cells and limiting receptor accessibility. However, high-resolution measurements of molecular heights on native cell membranes have been difficult to obtain. Here we present a simple and rapid method that achieves nanometer height resolution by localizing fluorophores at the tip and base of cell surface molecules and determining their separation by radially averaging across many molecules. We use this method, which we call cell surface optical profilometry (CSOP), to quantify height of key multi-domain proteins on a model macrophage and cancer cell, as well as to capture average protein and glycan heights on native cell membranes. We show that average height of a protein is significantly smaller than its contour length due to thermally driven bending and rotation on the membrane and that height strongly depends on local surface and solution conditions. We find that average height increases with cell surface molecular crowding, while it decreases with solution crowding by solutes, both of which we confirm with molecular dynamics simulations. We also use experiments and simulations to determine the height of an epitope based on the location of an antibody, which allows CSOP to profile various proteins and glycans on a native cell surface using antibodies and lectins. This versatile method for profiling cell surfaces has the potential to advance understanding of the molecular landscape of cells and its role in cell function.",

    "abstract": "Post-translational modifications on histones can be stable epigenetic marks and transient signals that can occur in response to internal and external stimuli. Levels of histone modifications fluctuate during the cell cycle and vary among different cell types. Here we describe a simple system to monitor the levels of multiple histone modifications in single cells by multicolor immunofluorescence using directly labeled modification-specific antibodies. We first analyzed histone H3 and H4 modifications during the cell cycle. Levels of active marks, such as acetylation and H3K4 methylation, were increased during the S phase, in association with chromatin duplication. By contrast, levels of some repressive modifications gradually increased during the G2 and the next G1 phases. We applied this method to validate the target modifications of various histone demethylases in cells using a transient overexpression system. We also screened chemical compounds in marine organism extracts that affect histone modifications and identified psammaplin A, which was previously reported to inhibit histone deacetylases. Thus, the method presented here is a powerful and convenient tool for analyzing the changes in histone modifications.",
