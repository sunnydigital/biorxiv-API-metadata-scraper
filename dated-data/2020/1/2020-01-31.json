    "abstract": "Calcium homeostasis modulator (CALHM) family proteins are Ca2+-regulated ATP-release channels involved in neural functions including neurotransmission in gustation. Here we present the cryo-EM structures of killifish CALHM1, human CALHM2, and C. elegans CLHM-1 at resolutions of 2.66, 3.51, and 3.60 [A], respectively. The CALHM1 octamer structure reveals that the N-terminal helix forms the constriction site at the channel pore in the open state, and modulates the ATP conductance. The CALHM2 undecamer and CLHM-1 nonomer structures show the different oligomeric stoichiometries among CALHM homologs. We further report the cryo-EM structures of the chimeric construct, revealing that the inter-subunit interactions at the transmembrane domain define the oligomeric stoichiometry. These findings advance our understanding of the ATP conduction and oligomerization mechanisms of CALHM channels.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryCryo-EM structures reveal the ATP conduction and oligomeric assembly mechanisms of CALHM channels.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant migration of inhibitory interneurons can alter the formation of cortical circuitry and lead to severe neurological disorders including epilepsy, autism, and schizophrenia. However, mechanisms involved in directing the migration of these cells remain incompletely understood. In the current study, we used live-cell confocal microscopy to explore the mechanisms by which the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway coordinates leading process branching and nucleokinesis, two cell biological processes that are essential for the guided migration of cortical interneurons. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK signaling disrupts the kinetics of leading process branching, rate and amplitude of nucleokinesis, and leads to the rearward mislocalization of the centrosome and primary cilium to the trailing process. Genetic loss of Jnk from interneurons corroborates our pharmacological observations and suggests that important mechanics of interneuron migration depend on the intrinsic activity of JNK. These findings suggest that JNK signaling regulates leading process branching, nucleokinesis, and the trafficking of centrosomes and cilia during interneuron migration, and further implicates JNK signaling as an important mediator of cortical development.\n\nSummary StatementLoss of JNK signaling reduces growth cone branching frequency, limits interstitial side branch duration, alters rate and amplitude of nucleokinesis, and mislocalizes centrosomes and primary cilia in migrating cortical interneurons.",

    "abstract": "Quorum sensing (QS) is a recognized phenomenon that is crucial for regulating population-related behaviors in bacteria. However, the direct specific effect of QS molecules on host biology is largely under-studied. In this work, we show that the QS molecule DSF (cis-11-methyl-dodecenoic acid) produced by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris can suppress pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis thaliana, mediated by flagellin-induced activation of flagellin receptor FLS2. The DSF-mediated attenuation of innate immunity results from the alteration of oligomerization states and endocytic internalization of plasma membrane FLS2. DSF altered the lipid profile of Arabidopsis, with a particular increase of the phytosterol species, which impairs the general endocytosis pathway mediated by clathrin and FLS2 nano-clustering on the plasma membrane. The DSF effect on receptor dynamics and host immune responses could be entirely reversed by sterol removal. Together, our results highlighted the importance of sterol homeostasis to plasma membrane organization and demonstrate a novel mechanism by which pathogenic bacteria use their communicating molecule to manipulate PAMP-triggered host immunity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBacteria rely on small signalling molecules called quorum sensing (QS) signals to communicate and coordinate their behaviors. QS is known to regulate gene expression, production of virulence factors, and biofilm formation for pathogenic bacteria to effectively colonize their hosts and cause diseases. In this work, we found a class of QS molecule called diffusible-signal factor (DSF), produced by devastating phytopathogenic bacteria such as Xanthomonas spp. and Xylella fastidiosa, could communicate directly with plant host and subvert plant innate immunity by inducing plant sterol production and thereby, attenuating receptor signalling through hindering the receptor clustering and plant endocytosis. The results significantly enrich our understanding of the mechanisms in the tug-of-war between bacterial pathogenesis and host immunity.",

    "abstract": "Modular response analysis (MRA) is a widely used modeling technique to uncover coupling strengths in molecular networks under a steady-state condition by means of perturbation experiments. We propose an extension of this methodology to search genomic data for new associations with a network modeled by MRA and to improve the predictive accuracy of MRA models. These extensions are illustrated by exploring the cross talk between estrogen and retinoic acid receptors, two nuclear receptors implicated in several hormone-driven cancers such as breast. We also present a novel, rigorous and elegant mathematical derivation of MRA equations, which is the foundation of this work and of an R package that is freely available at https://github.com/bioinfo-ircm/aiMeRA/. This mathematical analysis should facilitate MRA understanding by newcomers.\n\nAuthor summaryEstrogen and retinoic acid receptors play an important role in several hormone-driven cancers and share co-regulators and co-repressors that modulate their transcription factor activity. The literature shows evidence for crosstalk between these two receptors and suggests that spatial competition on the promoters could be a mechanism. We used MRA to explore the possibility that key co-repressors, i.e., NRIP1 (RIP140) and LCoR could also mediate crosstalk by exploiting new quantitative (qPCR) and RNA sequencing data. The transcription factor role of the receptors and the availability of genome-wide data enabled us to explore extensions of the MRA methodology to explore genome-wide data sets a posteriori, searching for genes associated with a molecular network that was sampled by perturbation experiments. Despite nearly two decades of use, we felt that MRA lacked a systematic mathematical derivation. We present here an elegant and rather simple analysis that should greatly facilitate newcomers understanding of MRA details. Moreover, an easy-to-use R package is released that should make MRA accessible to biology labs without mathematical expertise. Quantitative data are embedded in the R package and RNA sequencing data are available from GEO.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic models of biochemical systems provide a rigorous kinetics-based description of various biological phenomena. They are indispensable to elucidate biological design principles and to devise and engineer systems with novel functionalities. To date, mathematical analysis and characterization of these models remain a challenging endeavor, the main difficulty being the lack of information for most system parameters. Here, we introduce the Design Space Toolbox v.3.0 (DST3), a software implementation of the Design Space formalism that enables mechanistic modeling of complex biological processes without requiring previous knowledge of the parameter values involved. This is achieved by making use of a phenotype-centric modeling approach, in which the system is first decomposed into a series of biochemical phenotypes. Parameter values realizing phenotypes of interest are predicted in a second step. DST3 represents the most generally applicable implementation of the Design Space formalism to date and offers unique advantages over earlier versions. By expanding the capabilities of the Design Space formalism and streamlining its distribution, DST3 represents a valuable tool for elucidating biological design principles and guiding the design and optimization of novel synthetic circuits.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria often possess alternative sigma factors that initiate the transcription of specific genes under environmental stresses, the largest and most diverse group being the extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors. The regulation of ECF activity is crucial for ensuring the distinct transcription of stress responsive genes only occurs under the appropriate conditions. While most ECFs are comprised of only the core {sigma}2 and {sigma}4 regions, a unique form of ECF sigma factor regulation also contains a C-terminal extension bearing homology to the NTF2 superfamily of protein domains. While previous work has shown that this NTF2 domain can affect transcriptional activity in vivo in ECF41 and ECF42, its role in the newly classified ECF56 subgroup is unknown. In this work, we show that truncation of the C-terminus of the ECF56 sigma factor SVEN_4562 of Streptomyces venezuelae upregulates its activity in a hybrid assay. Through transcriptomics in S. venezuelae, we found that this truncated ECF56 sigma factor has a highly conserved promoter sequence in vivo. Bioinformatic assays illustrated that deep branches of the Actinobacteria phylum contained putative ECF56 promoter motifs identical to those found in the S. venezuelae ECF56 regulon. We validated these findings through ex situ hybrid assays illustrating that truncated ECF56 sigma factors from phylogenetically diverse Actinobacteria activate transcription from these promoters. Importantly, our work shows that the genetic infrastructure of the ECF56 family of sigma factors is highly conserved and performs important functions yet to be understood in Actinobacteria.\n\nImportanceMost ECF sigma-factors rely on anti-sigma factor regulation; in contrast, the unique classes of ECF sigma-factors that contain a C-terminal extension are thought to respond directly to an environmental signal. Here we show that the cis-acting regulatory element of the ECF56 regulon is likely highly conserved in many Actinobacteria, with exact nucleotide level conservation over ~2 billion years of evolution. The high conservation of this genetic architecture, as well as a conserved gene content within the regulon, strongly point to a specialized and important role in Actinobacteria biology.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) increases presentation of class I human leukocyte antigen (HLA) proteins that limit antiviral responses mediated by natural killer (NK) cells, but molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. We observed that infection with A/Fort Monmouth/1/1947 (H1N1) IAV significantly increased presentation of HLA-B, -C and -E on lung epithelial cells. Virus entry was not sufficient to induce HLA upregulation, because UV-inactivated virus had no effect. We found that HLA upregulation was elicited by aberrant internally-deleted viral RNAs (vRNAs) known as mini viral RNAs (mvRNAs) and defective interfering RNAs (DI RNAs), which bind to retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and initiate mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein-dependent antiviral interferon (IFN) responses. Indeed, MAVS was required for HLA upregulation in response to IAV infection or ectopic mvRNA/DI RNA expression. The effect was partially due to paracrine signalling, as we observed that IAV infection or mvRNA/DI RNA-expression stimulated production of IFN-{beta} and IFN-{lambda}1, and conditioned media from these cells elicited a modest increase in HLA surface levels in naive epithelial cells. HLA upregulation in response to aberrant viral RNAs could be prevented by chemical blockade of IFN receptor signal transduction. While HLA upregulation would seem to be advantageous to the virus, it is kept in check by the viral non-structural 1 (NS1) protein; we determined that NS1 limits cell-intrinsic and paracrine mechanisms of HLA upregulation. Taken together, our findings indicate that aberrant IAV RNAs stimulate HLA presentation, which may aid viral evasion of innate immunity.\n\nIMPORTANCEHuman leukocyte antigens (HLA) are cell surface proteins that regulate innate and adaptive immune responses to viral infection by engaging with receptors on immune cells. Many viruses have evolved ways to evade host immune responses by modulating HLA expression and/or processing. Here, we provide evidence that aberrant RNA products of influenza virus genome replication can trigger RIG-I/MAVS-dependent remodeling of the cell surface, increasing surface presentation of HLA proteins known to inhibit the activation of an immune cell known as a natural killer (NK) cell. While this HLA upregulation would seem to be advantageous to the virus, it is kept in check by the viral non-structural 1 (NS1) protein, which limits RIG-I activation and interferon production by the infected cell.",

    "abstract": "Protease-activated receptor type-2 (PAR2) has long been implicated in inflammatory and visceral pain, but the cellular basis of PAR2-evoked pain has not been delineated. While many studies have attributed PAR2-evoked pain to sensory neuron expression, RNA-sequencing experiments are ambiguous on detection of F2rl1 mRNA. Moreover, many pharmacological tools for PAR2 have been shown to be non-specific as they also act on the Mas-related (Mrg) family of g-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are highly enriched in sensory neurons. We sought to bring clarity to the cellular basis of PAR2 pain. We developed a PAR2 conditional mutant mouse by loxp targeting of exon 2 of the F2rl1 gene and specifically deleted PAR2 in all sensory neurons using the PirtCre mouse line. Our behavioral findings show that PAR2 agonist-evoked mechanical hyperalgesia and facial grimacing, but not thermal hyperalgesia, is completely dependent on PAR2 expression in sensory neurons that project to the hindpaw in male and female mice. F2rl1 mRNA is expressed in a discrete population (~4%) of sensory neurons that also express the Nppb and IL31ra genes. This cell population has previously been implicated in itch, but our work shows that PAR2 activation in these cells causes clear pain-related behaviors from the skin. Our findings clarify the mechanism through which proteases, like tryptase and elastase, cause pain via PAR2 activation in a small subset of nociceptors.",

    "abstract": "Animals have a remarkable capacity to learn new motor skills, but it remains an open question as to how learning changes neural population dynamics underlying movement1. Specifically, we asked whether changes in neural population dynamics relate purely to newly learned movements or if additional patterns are generated that facilitate learning without matching motor output. We trained rhesus monkeys to learn a curl force field2 task that elicited new arm-movement kinetics for some but not all reach directions3,4. We found that along certain neural dimensions, preparatory activity in motor cortex reassociated existing activity patterns with new movements. These systematic changes were observed only for learning-altered reaches. Surprisingly, we also found prominent shifts of preparatory activity along a nearly orthogonal neural dimension. These changes in preparatory activity were observed uniformly for all reaches including those unaltered by learning. This uniform shift during learning implies formation of new neural activity patterns, which was not observed in other short-term learning contexts5-8. During a washout period when the curl field was removed, movement kinetics gradually reverted, but the learning-induced uniform shift of preparatory activity persisted and a second, orthogonal uniform shift occurred. This persistent shift may retain a motor memory of the learned field9-11, consistent with faster relearning of the same curl field observed behaviorally and neurally. When multiple different curl fields were learned sequentially, we found distinct uniform shifts, each reflecting the identity of the field applied and potentially separating the associated motor memories12,13. The neural geometry of these shifts in preparatory activity could serve to organize skill-specific changes in movement production, facilitating the acquisition and retention of a broad motor repertoire.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGenome Architecture Mapping (GAM) was recently introduced as a digestion- and ligation-free method to detect chromatin conformation. Orthogonal to existing approaches based on chromatin conformation capture (3C), GAMs ability to capture both inter- and intra-chromosomal contacts from low amounts of input data makes it particularly well suited for allele-specific analyses in a clinical setting. Allele-specific analyses are powerful tools to investigate the effects of genetic variants on many cellular phenotypes including chromatin conformation, but require the haplotypes of the individuals under study to be known a-priori. So far however, no algorithm exists for haplotype reconstruction and phasing of genetic variants from GAM data, hindering the allele-specific analysis of chromatin contact points in non-model organisms or individuals with unknown haplotypes.\n\nResultsWe present GAMIBHEAR, a tool for accurate haplotype reconstruction from GAM data. GAMIBHEAR aggregates allelic co-observation frequencies from GAM data and employs a GAM-specific probabilistic model of haplotype capture to optimise phasing accuracy. Using a hybrid mouse embryonic stem cell line with known haplotype structure as a benchmark dataset, we assess correctness and completeness of the reconstructed haplotypes, and demonstrate the power of GAMIBHEAR to infer accurate genome-wide haplotypes from GAM data.\n\nAvailabilityGAMIBHEAR is available as an R package under the open source GPL-2 license at https://bitbucket.org/schwarzlab/gamibhear\n\nMaintainer: julia.markowski@mdc-berlin.de",

    "abstract": "The shortage of donor organs for transplantation has prompted the development of alternative implantable human liver tissues; however, the need for a clinically viable liver tissue that can be fabricated using physiologically-relevant primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) is unmet. Purified silk proteins provide desirable features for generating implantable tissues, such as sustainable sourcing from insects/arachnids, biocompatibility, tunable mechanical properties and degradation rates, and low immunogenicity upon implantation; however, the utility of such scaffolds to generate human liver tissues using PHHs remains unclear. Here, we show that the incorporation of type I collagen during the fabrication and/or autoclaving of silk scaffolds was necessary to enable robust PHH attachment/function. Scaffolds with small pores (73 +/- 25 {micro}m) promoted higher PHH functions than large pores (235 +/- 84 {micro}m). Further incorporation of growth-arrested 3T3-J2 fibroblasts into scaffolds enhanced PHH functions up to 5-fold for 5 months in culture, an unprecedented longevity, and functions were better retained than 2D configurations. Lastly, encapsulating PHHs within Matrigel while housed in the silk/collagen scaffold led to higher functions than Matrigel or silk/collagen alone. In conclusion, porous silk scaffolds are useful for generating long-term PHH +/- fibroblast tissues which may ultimately find applications in regenerative medicine and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Extensive research in the behavioural sciences has addressed peoples ability to learn stationary probabilities, which stay constant over time, but only recently have there been attempts to model the cognitive processes whereby people learn - and track - non-stationary probabilities. In this context, the old debate on whether learning occurs by gradual formation of associations or by occasional shifts between hypotheses representing beliefs about distal states of the world has resurfaced. Gallistel et al. (2014) pitched the two theories against each other in a non-stationary probability learning task. They concluded that various qualitative patterns in their data were incompatible with trial-by-trial associative learning and could only be explained by a hypothesis-testing model. Here, we contest that claim and demonstrate that it was premature. First, we argue that their experimental paradigm consisted of two distinct tasks: probability tracking (an estimation task) and change detection (a decision-making task). Next, we present a model that uses the (associative) delta learning rule for the probability tracking task and bounded evidence accumulation for the change-detection task. We find that this combination of two highly established theories accounts well for all qualitative phenomena and outperforms the alternative model proposed by Gallistel et al. in a quantitative model comparison. In the spirit of cumulative science, we conclude that current experimental data on human learning of non-stationary probabilities can be explained as a combination of associative learning and bounded evidence accumulation and does not require a new model.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStudying genetic associations with prognosis (e.g. survival, disability, subsequent disease events) is problematic due to selection bias - also termed index event bias or collider bias - whereby selection on disease status can induce associations between causes of incidence with prognosis. A current method for adjusting genetic associations for this bias assumes there is no genetic correlation between incidence and prognosis, which may not be a plausible assumption.\n\nMethodsWe propose an alternative, the  Slope-Hunter approach, which is unbiased even when there is genetic correlation between incidence and prognosis. Our approach has two stages. First, we use cluster-based techniques to identify: variants affecting neither incidence nor prognosis (these should not suffer bias and only a random sub-sample of them are retained in the analysis); variants affecting prognosis only (excluded from the analysis). Second, we fit a cluster-based model to identify the class of variants only affecting incidence, and use this class to estimate the adjustment factor.\n\nResultsSimulation studies showed that the Slope-Hunter method reduces type-1 error by between 49%-85%, increases power by 1%-36%, reduces bias by 17%-47% compared to other methods in the presence of genetic correlation and performs as well as previous methods when there is no genetic correlation. Slope-Hunter and the previous methods perform less well as the proportion of variation in incidence explained by genetic variants affecting only incidence decreases.\n\nConclusionsThe key assumption of Slope-Hunter is that the contribution of the set of genetic variants affecting incidence only to the heritability of incidence is at least as large as the contribution of those affecting both incidence and prognosis. When this assumption holds, our approach is unbiased in the presence of genetic correlation between incidence and progression, and performs no worse than alternative approaches even when there is no correlation. Bias-adjusting methods should be used to carry out causal analyses when conditioning on incidence.",

    "abstract": "Phytoplasmas are plant-pathogenic bacteria that impact agriculture worldwide. The commonly adopted classification system for phytoplasmas is based on the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of their 16S rRNA genes. With the increased availability of phytoplasma genome sequences, the classification system can now be refined. This work examined 11 strains in the 16SrI group within the genus  Candidatus Phytoplasma and investigated the possible species boundaries. We confirmed that the RFLP classification method is problematic due to intragenomic variation of the 16S rRNA genes and uneven weighing of different nucleotide positions. Importantly, our results based on the molecular phylogeny, differentiations in chromosomal segments and gene content, and divergence in homologous sequences, all supported that these strains may be classified into multiple operational taxonomic units (OTUs) equivalent to species. Strains assigned to the same OTU share >97% genome-wide average nucleotide identity (ANI) and >78% of their protein-coding genes. In comparison, strains assigned to different OTUs share <94% ANI and <75% of their genes. Reduction in homologous recombination between OTUs is one possible explanation for the discontinuity in genome similarities, and these findings supported the proposal that 95% ANI could serve as a cutoff for distinguishing species in bacteria. Additionally, critical examination of these results and the raw sequencing reads led to the identification of one genome that was presumably mis-assembled by combining two sequencing libraries built from phytoplasmas belonging to different OTUs. This finding provided a cautionary tale for working on uncultivated bacteria. Based on the new understanding of phytoplasma divergence and the current genome availability, we developed five molecular markers that could be used for multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA). By selecting markers that are short yet highly informative, and are distributed evenly across the chromosome, these markers provided a cost-effective system that is robust against recombination. Finally, examination of the effector gene distribution further confirmed the rapid gains and losses of these genes, as well as the involvement of potential mobile units (PMUs) in their molecular evolution. Future improvements on the taxon sampling of phytoplasma genomes will allow further expansions of similar analysis, and thus contribute to phytoplasma taxonomy and diagnostics.",

Further, we describe for the first time rare cell subsets which may represent dendritic cells, natural killer-like cells and a population of cytotoxic cells expressing GATA-3.

Accordingly, in visual cortex, responses to a stimulus are modulated by context, the visual scene surrounding the stimulus. Responses are suppressed when stimulus and surround are similar but not when they differ. The mechanisms that remove suppression when stimulus and surround differ remain unclear. Here we use optical recordings, manipulations, and computational modelling to show that a disinhibitory circuit consisting of vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) and somatostatin-expressing (SOM) inhibitory neurons modulates responses in mouse visual cortex depending on the similarity between stimulus and surround. When the stimulus and the surround are similar, VIP neurons are inactive and SOM neurons suppress excitatory neurons. However, when the stimulus and the surround differ, VIP neurons are active, thereby inhibiting SOM neurons and relieving excitatory neurons from suppression. We have identified a canonical cortical disinhibitory circuit which contributes to contextual modulation and may regulate perceptual saliency.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine agonist (DA) medications commonly used to treat, or  normalise, motor symptoms of Parkinsons disease (PD) may lead to cognitive-neuropsychiatric side effects, such as increased impulsivity in decision-making. Subject-dependent variation in the neural response to dopamine modulation within cortico-basal ganglia circuitry is thought to play a key role in these latter, non-motor DA effects. This neuroimaging study combined resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) with DA modification in patients with idiopathic PD, investigating whether brain  resting-state network (RSN) functional connectivity metrics identify disease-relevant effects of dopamine on systems-level neural processing. By comparing patients both  On and  Off their DA medications with age-matched, un-medicated healthy control subjects (HCs), we identified multiple non-normalising DA effects on frontal and basal ganglia RSN cortico-subcortical connectivity patterns in PD. Only a single isolated, potentially  normalising, DA effect on RSN connectivity in sensori-motor systems was observed, within cerebro-cerebellar neurocircuitry. Impulsivity in reward-based decision-making was positively correlated with ventral striatal connectivity within basal ganglia circuitry in HCs, but not in PD patients. Overall, we provide brain systems-level evidence for anomalous DA effects in PD on large-scale networks supporting cognition and motivated behaviour. Moreover, findings suggest that dysfunctional striatal and basal ganglia signalling patterns in PD are compensated for by increased recruitment of other cortico-subcortical and cerebro-cerebellar systems.",

    "abstract": "In spinal cord, white matter is distinguished from grey matter in that it contains ascending and descending axonal tracts. While grey matter gets concentrated with neuronal cell bodies. Notable cell bodies and sensory modality of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) in white matter are still elusive in certain segment of the spinal cord. Monkey Spinal cord was examined by NADPH diaphorase (NADPH-d) histochemistry. We found that NADPH-d positive neurons clustered and featured flat plane in mediolateral funiculus in caudal thoracic and rostral lumber spinal cord, especially evident in the horizontal sections. Majority of NADPH-d funicular neurons were relatively large size and moderately-or lightly-stained neurons. In horizontal section, the multipolar processes of the neurons were thicker than that of regular other neurons. The processes oriented laterally or obliquely in the lateral funiculus. Some of neuronal cell bodies and proximal processes attached NADPH-d positive buttons or puncta. The neuronal processes interlaced network medially linked to lateral horn (intermediolateral nucleus, IML) and laterally to subpial region, in which formed subpial plexus with subpial NADPH-d neurons. Subpial plexus appeared to contacting externally with CSF. The subpial plexus patterned like round brackets located in lateromarginal pial surface. Compared with sympathetic IML in rostral thoracic segments and sacral parasympathetic IML, the funicular plexus configurated a specialized neuro-texture in caudal thoracic segments. The dendritic arbor of funicular neuron featured variety geometric plane shapes. The funicular plexus oriented exclusive layered flat-plane organization between lateral horn and subpial region in caudal thoracic and rostral lumber spinal cord. The subpial plexus may work as CSF sensor outside of spinal cord. The cluster of funicular neurons may function as locomotion sensor, besides visceral regulation. Different to periventricular CSF contacting or pericentral canal structures, NADPH-d funicular neurons and subpial plexus that located in the pial surface. With advantage of NADPH-d, we found funicular neurons which termed academically as funicular plexus and specialized localization for subpial structure we termed subpial plexus.

    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a late developing region of the cortex, and its protracted maturation during adolescence may confer a period of plasticity. Closure of critical, or sensitive, periods in sensory cortices coincides with perineuronal net (PNN) expression, leading to enhanced inhibitory function and synaptic stabilization. PNN density is known to increase across adolescence in the male rodent medial PFC (mPFC). However, the trajectory of female PNN development has not been explored nor has the potential role of pubertal onset in PNN expression. Here, we examined rats at four time points spanning adolescent development to quantify the number of PNNs in the mPFC, as well as the total volume of the prefrontal white matter. Additionally, because puberty coincides with broad behavioral and neuroanatomical changes, we collected tissue from age-matched pre- and post- pubertal siblings within a litter. Results indicate that both males and females show an increase the total number of mPFC PNNs and in white matter under the mPFC between postnatal day (P) 30 and P60. Male puberty did not affect PNNs, while female pubertal onset led to an abrupt decrease in the total number of PNNs that persisted through mid-adolescence before increasing at P60. This decrease in female rats may indicate a difference in timing of maximal plasticity between the sexes during adolescence.",

The early detection and accurate histopathological diagnosis of gastric cancer are essential factors that can help increase the chances of successful treatment. While the worldwide shortage of pathologists has imposed burdens on current histopathology services, it also offers a unique opportunity for the use of artificial intelligence assistance systems to alleviate the workload and increase diagnostic accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been a clinically applicable histopathological assistance system with high accuracy that can generalize to whole slide images created with diverse digital scanner models from different hospitals. Here, we report a clinically applicable artificial intelligence assistance system developed at the Chinese PLA General Hospital, China, using a deep convolutional neural network trained with 2,123 pixel-level annotated H&amp;E-stained whole slide images. The model achieved a sensitivity near 100% and an average specificity of 80.6% on a real-world test dataset, which included 3,212 whole slide images digitalized with three scanner models. We showed that the system could aid pathologists in improving diagnostic accuracy and preventing misdiagnoses. Moreover, we demonstrated that our system could perform robustly with 1,582 whole slide images from two other medical centres. Our study suggests the feasibility and benefits of using histopathological artificial intelligence assistance systems in routine practice scenarios.Competing Interest StatementXiaoqing Zhang is the founder of Thorough Images.

    "abstract": "Endometriosis affects [~]176 million women worldwide, yet on average, women experience pain [~]10 years from symptom onset before being properly diagnosed. Standard treatments (drugs or surgery) often fail to provide long-term pain relief. Elevated levels of reactive aldehydes such as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) have been implicated in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis and upon accumulation, reactive aldehydes can form protein-adducts and/or generate pain. A key enzyme in detoxifying reactive aldehydes to less reactive forms, is the mitochondrial enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase-2 (ALDH2). Here, we tested the hypothesis that aberrant reactive aldehyde detoxification by ALDH2, underlies endometriosis and its associated pain. We determined, in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium of women with severe (stage IV) peritoneal endometriosis, that ALDH2 enzyme activity was decreased, which was associated with decreased ALDH2 expression and increased 4-HNE adduct formation compared to the eutopic endometrium of controls in the proliferative phase. Using a rodent model of endometriosis and an ALDH2*2 knock-in mouse with decreased ALDH2 activity, we determined that increasing ALDH2 activity with the enzyme activator Alda-1 could prevent endometriosis lesion development as well as alleviate pain-associated behaviors in proestrus. Overall, our findings suggest that targeting the ALDH2 enzyme in endometriosis may lead to better treatment strategies and in the proliferative phase, that increased 4-HNE adduct formation within the endometrium may serve as a less invasive diagnostic biomarker to reduce years of suffering in women.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryALDH2 activity influences endometriosis and its associated pain.",

We found that prs4 knockouts are embryo-lethal in A. thaliana, and that silencing PRS4 expression in N. benthamiana causes pleiotropic developmental phenotypes, including dwarfism, aberrant leaf shape, and delayed flowering. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that ribosome biogenesis is among the most strongly repressed processes in prs4 knockdowns. Building on these results, we discovered that TOR activity is inhibited by chemical or genetic disruption of nucleotide biosynthesis, but that this effect can be reversed by supplying plants with physiological levels of nucleotides. Finally, we show that TOR transcriptionally promotes nucleotide biosynthesis to support the demands of ribosomal RNA synthesis. We propose that TOR coordinates ribosome biogenesis with nucleotide availability in plants to maintain metabolic homeostasis and support growth.",

    "abstract": "Food security for the growing global population is a major concern. The data provided by genomic tools far exceeds the supply of phenotypic data, creating a knowledge gap. To meet the challenge of improving crops to feed the growing global population, this gap must be bridged.\n\nPhysiological traits are considered key functional traits in the context of responsiveness or sensitivity to environmental conditions. Many recently introduced high-throughput phenotyping techniques are based on remote sensing or imaging and are capable of directly measuring morphological traits, but measure physiological parameters only indirectly.\n\nThis paper describes a method for direct physiological phenotyping that has several advantages for the functional phenotyping of plant-environment interactions. It aims to help users overcome the many challenges encountered in the use of load-cell gravimetric systems and pot experiments. The suggested techniques will enable users to distinguish between soil weight, plant weight and soil water content, providing a method for continuous and simultaneous measurement of dynamic soil, plant and atmosphere conditions, alongside key physiological traits. This method allows researchers to closely mimic field stress scenarios while taking into consideration the environments effect on the plants physiology. This method also minimizes pot effects, which are one of the major problems in pre-field phenotyping. It includes a feedback fertigation system that enables a truly randomized experimental design with a field-like plant density. This system detects the soil-water content limiting threshold ({theta}) and allows for the translation of data into knowledge through the use of a real-time analytic tool and an online statistical resource. This method for the rapid and direct measurement of the physiological responses of multiple plants to a dynamic environment has great potential for use in screening for beneficial traits associated with responses to abiotic stress, in the context of pre-field breeding and crop improvement.\n\nSUMMARYThis high-throughput, whole-plant water relations gravimetric phenotyping method enables direct and simultaneous real-time measurements and analysis of multiple yield-related physiological traits involved in dynamic plant-environment interactions.",

    "abstract": "AimSoil microorganisms are essential for the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Although soil microbial communities and functions may be linked to the tree species composition and diversity of forests, there has been no comprehensive study of how general potential relationships are and if these are context-dependent. A global network of tree diversity experiments (TreeDivNet) allows for a first examination of tree diversity-soil microbial function relationships across environmental gradients.\n\nLocationGlobal\n\nMajor Taxa StudiedSoil microorganisms\n\nMethodsSoil samples collected from eleven tree diversity experiments in four biomes across four continents were used to measure soil basal respiration, microbial biomass, and carbon use efficiency using the substrate-induced respiration method. All samples were measured using the same analytical device in the same laboratory to prevent measurement bias. We used linear mixed-effects models to examine the effects of tree species diversity, environmental conditions, and their interactions on soil microbial functions.\n\nResultsAcross biodiversity experiments, abiotic drivers, mainly soil water content, significantly increased soil microbial functions. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) increased, whereas soil C-to-N ratio (CN) decreased soil microbial functions under dry soil conditions, but high soil water content reduced the importance of other abiotic drivers. Tree species richness and phylogenetic diversity had overall similar, but weak and context-dependent (climate, soil abiotic variables) effects on soil microbial respiration. Positive tree diversity effects on soil microbial respiration were most pronounced at low PET, low soil CN, and high tree density. Soil microbial functions increased with the age of the experiment.\n\nMain conclusionsOur results point at the importance of soil water content for maintaining high levels of soil microbial functions and modulating effects of other environmental drivers. Moreover, overall tree diversity effects on soil microbial functions seem to be negligible in the short term (experiments were 1-18 years old). However, context-dependent tree diversity effects (climate, soil abiotic variables) have greater importance at high tree density, and significant effects of experimental age call for longer-term studies. Such systematic insights are key to better integrate soil carbon dynamics into the management of afforestation projects across environmental contexts, as todays reforestation efforts remain focused largely on aboveground carbon storage and are still dominated by less diverse forests stands of commercial species.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity in communities is changing globally, including the gain and loss of host species in host-pathogen communities. Increased host diversity can cause infection prevalence in a focal host to increase (amplification) or decrease (dilution). However, it is unclear what general rules govern the context dependent effects, in part because theories for pathogens with different transmission modes have developed largely independently. Using a two-host model, we explore how the pathogen transmission mode and characteristics of a second host (disease competence and competitive ability) influence disease prevalence in a focal host. Our work shows how the theories for pathogens with environmental transmission, density-dependent direct transmission, and frequency-dependent direct transmission can be unified. Our work also identifies general rules about how host and pathogen characteristics affect amplification/dilution. For example, higher competence hosts promote amplification, unless they are strong interspecific competitors; strong interspecific competitors promote dilution, unless they are large sources of new infections; and dilution occurs under frequency-dependent direct transmission more than density-dependent direct transmission, unless interspecific host competition is sufficiently strong. Our work helps explain how the characteristics of the pathogen and a second host affect disease prevalence in a focal host.",

    "abstract": "Eco-evolutionary processes may play an important role in the spatial spread of infectious disease. Current theory predicts more exploitative parasites to evolve in highly connected populations or at the front of spreading epidemics. However, many parasites rely on host dispersal to reach new populations. This may lead to conflict between local transmission and global spread, possibly counteracting selection for higher virulence. Here, we used the freshwater host Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata to investigate parasite evolution under an experimental range expansion scenario with natural host dispersal. We find that parasites evolving at experimental range fronts favoured higher dispersal rates of infected hosts than did parasites evolving in core populations. Front parasites further showed lower levels of virulence (host division and survival) and delayed development of infection, consistent with parameter estimates from an epidemiological model that we fitted on experimental time-series data. This combined evidence suggests an evolutionary trade-off between virulence and host-mediated dispersal, with a concomitant reduction in the investment into horizontal transmission. Our experiment illustrates how parasite evolution can be shaped by divergent selection encountered in different segments of an epidemic wave. Such an interplay between demography and spatial selection has important implications for the understanding and management of emerging diseases, and, more generally, for biological invasions and other non-equilibrium scenarios of spreading populations.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhat drives parasite evolution in spatially expanding epidemics? Many parasites require dispersal of infected hosts to reach new patches, and this may produce specific adaptations enhancing spatial spread. We performed experimental range expansions in an aquatic model system, with natural dispersal of infected hosts. Parasites from experimental range fronts were less virulent and interfered less with host dispersal, but also invested less in horizontal transmission than parasites from the range core. Thus, dispersal adaptation at the front may come at a cost of reduced horizontal transmission, a trade-off rarely considered in theoretical models on parasite virulence evolution. These results have important implications in the context of emerging diseases, and for parasite evolution during biological invasions or other spatial non-equilibrium scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the causative agent of nearly all forms of cervical cancer, which arises upon viral integration into the host genome and concurrent loss of regulatory gene E2. E2 protein regulates viral oncoproteins E6 and E7. Loss of E2 upon viral integration results in unregulated expression and activity of E6 and E7, which promotes carcinogenesis. Previous studies using gene-based delivery show that reintroduction of E2 into cervical cancer cell lines can reduce proliferative capacity and promote apoptosis. However, owing in part to limitations on transfection in vivo, E2 reintroduction has yet to achieve therapeutic usefulness. A promising new approach is protein-based delivery systems utilizing cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs). CPPs readily traverse the plasma membrane and are able to carry with them biomolecular  cargos to which they are attached. Though more than two decades of research have been dedicated to their development for delivery of biomolecular therapeutics, the full potential of CPPs has yet to be realized as the field is hindered by the tendency of CPP-linked cargos to be trapped in endosomes as well as having significant off-target potential in vivo. Using a CPP-adaptor system that reversibly binds cargo thereby overcoming the endosomal entrapment that hampers other CPP methods, bioactive E2 protein was delivered into living cervical cancer cells, resulting in inhibition of cellular proliferation and promotion of cell death in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The results suggest that this nucleic acid- and virus-free delivery method could be harnessed to develop novel, effective protein therapeutics for treatment of cervical cancer.",

Several vendors now offer proprietary enzyme cocktails as a cheaper and more streamlined method of fragmentation when compared to acoustic shearing. We have discovered that these enzymes induce the formation of library molecules containing regions of nearby DNA from opposite strands. Sequencing reads derived from these molecules can lead to artifact-derived variant calls appearing at variant allele frequencies less than 5%. We present Fragmentation Artifact Detection and Elimination (FADE), software to remove these artifacts from mapped reads and mitigate artifact-related effects on downstream analysis.

    "abstract": "Telomeres are regions of repetitive nucleotide sequences capping the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes that protect against deterioration, whose lengths can be correlated with age and disease risk factors. Given their length and repetitive nature, telomeric regions are not easily reconstructed from short read sequencing, making telomere sequence resolution a very costly and generally intractable problem. Recently, long-read sequencing, with read lengths measuring in hundreds of Kbp, has made it possible to routinely read into telomeric regions and inspect their structure. Here, we describe a framework for extracting telomeric reads from single-molecule sequencing experiments, describing their sequence variation and motifs, and for haplotype inference. We find that long telomeric stretches can be accurately captured with long-read sequencing, observe extensive sequence heterogeneity of human telomeres, discover and localize non-canonical motifs (both previously reported as well as novel), and report the first motif composition maps of human telomeric diplotypes on a multi-Kbp scale.",

    "abstract": "Information on zoonotic diseases in humans and livestock are limited in pastoral/agro-pastoral communities in Ethiopia. A multi-stage cross sectional cluster design study was implemented with the aim to establish the seroprevalence of zoonotic diseases including brucellosis, Q-fever and Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in humans and livestock in Adadle woreda of the Somali region, Ethiopia. Blood samples were collected from humans and livestock and tested by relevant serological tests. For brucellosis, Rose Bengal test (RBT) and indirect ELISA was used for screening and confirmatory diagnosis respectively. Indirect and competitive ELISA were also used for Q-fever and RVF respectively. The individual seropositivity of Q-fever in livestock was 9.6% (95% CI 5.9-15.1) in cattle, 55.7% (95% CI 46.0-65.0) in camels, 48.8% (95% CI 42.5-55.0) in goats, and 28.9% (95% CI 25.0-33.2) in sheep. In humans, seropositivity of Q-fever was 27.0% (95% CI 20.4-34.0), with prevalence in males of 28.9% vs 24.2% in females (OR= 1.3; 95% CI 0.6-2.5). Camel seropositivity of Q-fever was significantly associated with age (OR= 8.1; 95% CI 2.8-23.7). The individual apparent seroprevalence of RVF was 13.2% (95% CI 8.7-18.8) in humans, 17.9 % (95% CI 11.0-27.8) in cattle, 42.6% (95% CI 34.8-50.7) in camels, 6.3% (95% CI 3.3-11.6) in goats and 7.4% (95% CI 4.7-11.5) in sheep. Camels had the highest seropositivity of both Q-fever (55.7%; 95% CI 46.0-65.0) and RVF (42.6%; 95% CI 34.8-50.7). Only a weak correlation was observed between human and livestock seropositivity for both Q-fever and RVF. Only cattle and camels were seropositive for brucellosis by iELISA. The individual seroprevalence of brucellosis was 2.8(0.9-6.4) in humans, 1.5% (95% CI 0.2-5.2) in cattle and 0.6% (95% CI 0.0-3.2) in camels. This study showed the importance of zoonoses in Somali regional state and is the first published study to describe RVF exposure in humans and livestock in the country. Collaboration between public and animal health sectors for further investigation on these zoonoses using the One Health concept is indispensable.",

    "abstract": "Due to low abundance in many staple food crops, the essential amino acid lysine must be produced industrially to meet global food supply needs. Despite intensive study, manipulation, and agricultural importance, the steps of plant lysine catabolism beyond the 2-oxoadipate (2OA) intermediate remain undescribed. Recently we described a missing step in the D-lysine catabolic pathway of the bacterium Pseudomonas putida in which 2OA is converted to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D2HG) via hydroxyglutarate synthase (HglS), an enzyme belonging to the previously uncharacterized DUF1338 protein family. Here we solve the structure of HglS to 1.1[A] resolution in the substrate-free form and in complex with 2OA. Structural similarity to hydroxymandelate synthase suggested a successive decarboxylation and intramolecular hydroxylation mechanism forming 2HG in a Fe(II)- and O2-dependent manner, which is validated experimentally. 2OA specificity was mediated by a single arginine (R74), highly conserved across nearly all DUF1338 family proteins, including in 76% of plant enzymes. In Arabidopsis thaliana, a DUF1338 homolog is coexpressed with known lysine catabolism enzymes, and mutants show significant germination rate defects consistent with disrupted lysine catabolism. Structural and biochemical analysis of the Oryza sativa homolog FLO7 revealed identical activity to HglS despite low sequence identity. Our results suggest that nearly all DUF1338 containing enzymes likely catalyze the same biochemical reaction, exerting the same physiological function across bacteria and eukaryotes.\n\nSignificanceTo meet human demands, millions of tons of lysine are produced by bacterial fermentation annually due to its low abundance in staple crops. Here, we show the last missing step of lysine catabolism in nearly all plant endosperms is likely catalyzed by an iron-dependant DUF1338-containing enzyme homologous to the bacterial hydroxyglutarate synthase. Structural and bioninformatic analyses of DUF1338-containing enzymes showed high conservation of critical catalytic and specificity-conferring residues across multiple domains of life despite low sequence identity. These results suggest that the DUF1338 family evolved a specific physiological function within lysine catabolism across multiple domains of life.",

    "abstract": "In-vivo calcium imaging through microendoscopic lenses enables imaging of neuronal populations deep within the brains of freely moving animals. Previously, a constrained matrix factorization approach (CNMF-E) has been suggested to extract single-neuronal activity from microendoscopic data. However, this approach relies on offline batch processing of the entire video data and is demanding both in terms of computing and memory requirements. These drawbacks prevent its applicability to the analysis of large datasets and closed-loop experimental settings. Here we address both issues by introducing two different online algorithms for extracting neuronal activity from streaming microendoscopic data. Our first algorithm presents an online adaptation of the CNMF-E algorithm, which dramatically reduces its memory and computation requirements. Our second algorithm proposes a convolution-based background model for microendoscopic data that enables even faster (real time) processing on GPU hardware. Our approach is modular and can be combined with existing online motion artifact correction and activity deconvolution methods to provide a highly scalable pipeline for microendoscopic data analysis. We apply our algorithms on two previously published typical experimental datasets and show that they yield similar high-quality results as the popular offline approach, but outperform it with regard to computing time and memory requirements.\n\nAuthor summaryCalcium imaging methods enable researchers to measure the activity of genetically-targeted large-scale neuronal subpopulations. Whereas previous methods required the specimen to be stable, e.g. anesthetized or head-fixed, new brain imaging techniques using microendoscopic lenses and miniaturized microscopes have enabled deep brain imaging in freely moving mice.\n\nHowever, the very large background fluctuations, the inevitable movements and distortions of imaging field, and the extensive spatial overlaps of fluorescent signals complicate the goal of efficiently extracting accurate estimates of neural activity from the observed video data. Further, current activity extraction methods are computationally expensive due to the complex background model and are typically applied to imaging data after the experiment is complete. Moreover, in some scenarios it is necessary to perform experiments in real-time and closed-loop - analyzing data on-the-fly to guide the next experimental steps or to control feedback -, and this calls for new methods for accurate real-time processing. Here we address both issues by adapting a popular extraction method to operate online and extend it to utilize GPU hardware that enables real time processing. Our algorithms yield similar high-quality results as the original offline approach, but outperform it with regard to computing time and memory requirements. Our results enable faster and scalable analysis, and open the door to new closed-loop experiments in deep brain areas and on freely-moving preparations.",

Studies of the association between concurrent objective measures of sleep, physical activity, and metabolic risk factors among adolescents are limited.\n\nObjectiveThe aim of the study was to examine the association between metabolic risk factors and objectively measured school day physical activity and sleep duration, quality, onset, and variability in adolescents.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe measured one school week of free-living sleep and physical activity with wrist actigraphy in 252 adolescents (146 girls), aged 15.8{+/-}0.3 years. Metabolic risk factors included body mass index, waist circumference, total body and trunk fat percentage, resting blood pressure, and fasting glucose and insulin levels. Multiple linear regression adjusted for sex, parental education, and day length was used to assess associations between metabolic risk factors and sleep and activity parameters.\n\nResultsOn average, participants went to bed at 00:22{+/-}0.88 hours and slept 6.2{+/-}0.7 hours/night, with 0.83{+/-}0.36 hours of awakenings/night. However, night-to-night variability in sleep duration (0.87{+/-}0.57 hours) and bedtime (0.79{+/-}0.58 hours) was considerable. Neither average sleep duration nor mean bedtime was associated with any metabolic risk factors. However, greater night-to-night variability in sleep duration was associated with higher total body ({beta}=1.9{+/-}0.9 %/h, p=0.03) and trunk fat percentage ({beta}=1.6{+/-}0.7 %/h, p=0.02), poorer sleep quality (more hours of awakening) was associated with higher systolic blood pressure ({beta}=4.9{+/-}2.2 mmHg/h, p=0.03), and less physical activity was associated with higher trunk fat percentage (p=0.04) and insulin levels (p=0.01).\n\nConclusionGreater nightly variation in sleep, lower sleep quality, and less physical activity was associated with a less favorable metabolic profile in adolescents. These findings support the idea that, along with an adequate amount of sleep and physical activity, a regular sleep schedule is important to the metabolic health of adolescents.",

    "abstract": "Crocus sativus L. or saffron has been shown to have anti-atherogenic effects. However, its effects on key events in atherogenesis such as endothelial activation and monocyte-endothelial cell binding in lipolysaccharides (LPS)-stimulated in vitro model have not been extensively studied.\n\nObjectivesTo investigate the effects of saffron and its bioactive derivative crocin on the gene and protein expressions of biomarkers of endothelial activation in LPS stimulated human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs).\n\nMethodologyHCAECs were incubated with different concentrations of aqueous ethanolic extracts of saffron and crocin together with LPS. Protein and gene expressions of endothelial activation biomarkers were measured using ELISA and qRT-PCR, respectively. Adhesion of monocytes to HCAECs was detected by Rose Bengal staining. Methyl-thiazol-tetrazolium assay was carried out to assess cytotoxicity effects of saffron and crocin.\n\nResultsSaffron and crocin up to 25.0 and 1.6 g/ml respectively exhibited >85% cell viability. Saffron treatment reduced sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and E-selectin proteins (concentrations: 3.13, 6.25, 12.5 and 25.0 g/ml; 3.13, 12.5 and 25.0 g/ml; 12.5 and 25.0, respectively) and gene expressions (concentration: 12.5 and 25.0g/ml; 3.13, 6.25 and 25.0 g/ml; 6.25, 12.5 25.0; respectively). Similarly, treatment with crocin reduced protein expressions of sICAM-1, sVCAM-1 and E-selectin (concentration: 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 g/ml; 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 g/ml; 0.8 and 1.6 g/ml; respectively] and gene expression (concentration: 0.8 and 1.6 g/ml; 0.4, 0.8 and 1.6 g/ml; and 1.6 g/ml, respectively). Monocyte-endothelial cell interactions were reduced following saffron treatment at concentrations 6.3, 12.5 and 25.00 g/ml. Similarly, crocin also suppressed cellular interactions at concentrations 0.04, 0.08, 1.60 g/ml.\n\nConclusionSaffron and crocin exhibits potent inhibitory action for endothelial activation and monocyte-endothelial cells interaction suggesting its potential anti-atherogenic properties.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses such as the newly discovered virus from Wuhan, China, 2019-nCoV, and the viruses that cause SARS and MERS, have resulted in regional and global public health emergencies. Based on our molecular insight that the hepatitis C virus and the coronavirus use a similar viral genome replication mechanism, we reasoned that the FDA-approved drug EPCLUSA (Sofosbuvir/Velpatasvir) for the treatment of hepatitis C will also inhibit the above coronaviruses, including 2019-nCoV. To develop broad spectrum anti-viral agents, we further describe a novel strategy to design and synthesize viral polymerase inhibitors, by combining the ProTide Prodrug approach used in the development of Sofosbuvir with the use of 3-blocking groups that we have previously built into nucleotide analogues that function as polymerase terminators.",

    "abstract": "The global network of fridges and freezers known as the \"cold chain\" can account for a significant proportion of the total cost of vaccination and is susceptible to failure. Cost-efficient techniques to enhance stability of vaccines could prevent such losses and improve vaccination coverage, particularly in low income countries. We have previously reported a novel, potentially less expensive thermostabilisation approach using a combination of simple sugars and glass micro-fibrous matrix, achieving an excellent recovery of vaccines after storage at supraphysiological temperatures. This matrix is, however, prone to fragmentation and currently not suitable for clinical translation.\n\nHere, we report an investigation of alternative, potentially GMP compatible, fibrous matrices. A number of commercially-available matrices permitted good protein recovery, quality of sugar glass and moisture content of the dried product but did not achieve the thermostabilisation performance of the original glass fibre matrix. We therefore further investigated physical and chemical characteristics of the glass fibre matrix and its components. Our investigation shows that the polyvinyl alcohol present in the glass fibre matrix assists vaccine stability. This finding enabled us to develop a custom-produced matrix with encouraging performance, as an initial step towards a biocompatible matrix for clinical translation. We discuss the path to transfer of the technology into clinical use, including potential obstacles.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between effort-based decision making and gross motor performance. Effort-based decision making was measured using a modified version of the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task in which participants pressed a button on a keyboard to fill a bar on a screen for a monetary reward. Gross motor performance was measured with a walking task in which participants matched their steps to the beat of an audio metronome. We hypothesized that increased effort during the effort-based decision making task would be paired with an increase in steps taken per minute during the gross motor task. However, the results of this study indicated no relationship between the effort-based decision making task and the gross motor task. Planning rather than decision-making may have been the cognitive construct that governed our gross motor task. These findings can be beneficial when thinking about potential interventions for populations who experience deficits in motor performance and cognition as well as for understanding the relationship between both cognitive and motor performance in healthy adults.",
