    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression that last for multiple generations without changes in gene sequence have been reported in many plants and animals1-3. Cases of such transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (TEI) could support the ancestral origins of some diseases and drive evolutionary novelty. Here, we report that stably expressed sequences in C. elegans have features that provide a barrier against TEI. By using double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting the same sequence in different genes, we show that genes typically recover from silencing within the germline in a few generations. A rare recombinant two-gene operon containing this target sequence that recovered poorly from induced silencing enabled us to delineate mechanisms that can perpetuate silencing. Parental exposure to dsRNA targeting one gene within this operon reveals two distinct phases of the resulting TEI: only the matching gene is silenced in early generations, but both can become silenced in later generations. However, silencing of both genes can be initiated within one generation by mating, which perturbs intergenerational RNA-based mechanisms such that silencing dominates for more than 250 generations. This stable RNA silencing can also reduce the expression of homologous sequences in different genes in trans within the germline, but the homologous genes recover expression after a few generations. These results suggest that stably expressed sequences are subject to feedback control that opposes TEI initiated by multiple mechanisms within the germline. We speculate that similar homeostatic mechanisms that enable recovery from epigenetic changes underlie the observed preservation of form and function in successive generations of living systems.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe leaf economics spectrum (LES) is based on a suite of leaf traits related to plant functioning and ranges from resource-conservative to resource-acquisitive strategies. However, the relationships with root traits, and the associated belowground plant functioning such as N uptake, including nitrate (NO3-) and ammonium (NH4+), is still poorly known. Additionally, environmental variations occurring both in time and in space could uncouple LES from root traits. We explored, in subalpine grasslands, the relationships between leaf and root morphological traits for 3 dominant perennial grass species, and to what extent they contribute to the whole-plant economics spectrum. We also investigated the link between this spectrum and NO3- and NH4+ uptake rates, as well as the variations of uptake across four grasslands differing by the land-use history at peak biomass and in autumn. Although poorly correlated with leaf traits, root traits contributed to an economic spectrum at the whole plant level. Higher NH4+ and NO3- uptake abilities were associated with the resource-acquisitive strategy.\n\nNonetheless, NH4+ and NO3- uptake within species varied between land-uses and with sampling time, suggesting that LES and plant traits are good, but still incomplete, descriptors of plant functioning. Although the NH4+: NO3- uptake ratio was different between plant species in our study, they all showed a preference for NH4+, and particularly the most conservative species. Soil environmental variations between grasslands and sampling times may also drive to some extent the NH4+ and NO3- uptake ability of species. Our results support the current efforts to build a more general framework including above- and below-ground processes when studying plant community functioning.",

Three systems were prepared: the apo receptor, representing the constitutively active receptor; and two holo-receptors -the receptor coupled to the antagonist/inverse agonist ciproxifan and representing the inactive state of the receptor, and the receptor coupled to the endogenous agonist histamine and representing the active state of the receptor.\n\nAn extensive analysis of the simulation shows that the three states of H3R present significant structural and dynamical differences, as well as a complex behavior given that the measured properties interact in multiple and inter-dependent ways. In addition, the simulations describe an unexpected escape of histamine from the orthosteric binding site, in agreement with the experimental modest affinities and rapid off-rates of agonists.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic DNA-based data storage systems have received significant attention due to the promise of ultrahigh storage density and long-term stability. However, all platforms proposed so far suffer from high cost, read-write latency and error-rates that render them noncompetitive with modern optical and magnetic storage devices. One means to avoid synthesizing DNA and to reduce the system error-rates is to use readily available native DNA. As the symbol/nucleotide content of native DNA is fixed, one may adopt an alternative recording strategy that modifies the DNA topology to encode desired information. Here, we report the first macromolecular storage paradigm in which data is written in the form of \"nicks (punches)\" at predetermined positions on the sugar-phosphate backbone of native dsDNA. The platform accommodates parallel nicking on multiple \"orthogonal\" genomic DNA fragments and paired nicking and disassociation for creating \"toehold\" regions that enable single-bit random access and strand displacement in-memory computations. As a proof of concept, we used the programmable restriction enzyme Pyrococcus furiosus Argonaute to punch two files into the PCR products of Escherichia coli genomic DNA. The encoded data is accurately reconstructed through high-throughput sequencing and read alignment.",

    "abstract": "The development of successful social-cognitive abilities requires one to track, accumulate, and integrate knowledge of other peoples mental states across time. Regions of the brain differ in their temporal scale (i.e., a cortical temporal hierarchy) and those receptive to long temporal windows may facilitate social-cognitive abilities; however, the cortical development of long timescale processing remains to be investigated. The current study utilized naturalistic viewing to examine cortical development of long timescale processing and its relation to social-cognitive abilities in middle childhood - a time of expanding social spheres and increasing social-cognitive abilities. We found that, compared to adults, children exhibited reduced low-frequency power in the temporo-parietal junction (TPJ) and reduced specialization for long timescale processing within the TPJ and other regions broadly implicated in the default mode network and higher-order visual processing. Further, specialization for long timescales within the right dorsal medial prefrontal cortex became more  adult-like as a function of childrens comprehension of character mental states. These results suggest that cortical temporal hierarchy in middle childhood is immature and may be important for an accurate representation of complex naturalistic social stimuli during this age.",

    "abstract": "Motivated by growing evidence for pathway heterogeneity and alternative functions of molecular machines, we demonstrate a computational approach for investigating two questions: (1) Are there multiple mechanisms (state-space pathways) by which a machine can perform a given function, such as cotransport across a membrane? (2) How can additional functionality, such as proofreading/error-correction, be built into machine function using standard biochemical processes? Answers to these questions will aid both the understanding of molecular-scale cell biology and the design of synthetic machines. Focusing on transport in this initial study, we sample a variety of mechanisms by employing Metropolis Markov chain Monte Carlo. Trial moves adjust transition rates among an automatically generated set of conformational and binding states while maintaining fidelity to thermodynamic principles and a user-supplied fitness/functionality goal. Each accepted move generates a new model. The simulations yield both single and mixed reaction pathways for cotransport in a simple environment with a single substrate along with a driving ion. In a \"competitive\" environment including an additional decoy substrate, several qualitatively distinct reaction pathways are found which are capable of extremely high discrimination coupled to a leak of the driving ion, akin to proofreading. The array of functional models would be difficult to find by intuition alone in the complex state-spaces of interest.\n\nAuthor summaryMolecular machines, which operate on the nanoscale, are proteins/complexes that perform remarkable tasks such as the selective absorption of nutrients into the cell by transporters. These complex machines are often described using a fairly simple set of states and transitions that may not account for the stochasticity and heterogeneity generally expected at the nanoscale at body temperature. New tools are needed to study the full array of possibilities. This study presents a novel in silico method to systematically generate testable molecular-machine kinetic models and explore alternative mechanisms, applied first to membrane transport proteins. Our initial results suggest these transport machines may contain mechanisms which  detoxify the cell of an unwanted toxin, as well as significantly discriminate against the import of the toxin. This novel approach should aid the experimental study of key physiological processes such as renal glucose re-absorption, rational drug design, and potentially the development of synthetic machines.",

In turn, the acquired rich multidimensional data set enables simultaneous imaging of multiple fluorescent species for a comprehensive molecular assessment of biotissues. However, to enable quantitative imaging, inherent spectral overlap between the considered fluorescent probes and potential bleed-through must be taken into account. Such task is performed via either spectral or lifetime unmixing, typically independently. Herein, we present UNMIX-ME (unmix multiple emissions), a deep learning-based fluorescence unmixing routine, capable of quantitative fluorophore unmixing by simultaneously using both spectral and temporal signatures. UNMIX-ME was trained and validated using an in silico framework replicating the data acquisition process of a compressive hyperspectral fluorescent lifetime imaging platform (HMFLI). It was benchmarked against a conventional LSQ method for both tri and quadri-exponential simulated samples.

    "abstract": "Auxin controls multiple aspects of plant growth and development. However, its role in stress responses remains poorly understood. Auxin acts on the transcriptional regulation of target genes, mainly through Auxin Response Factors (ARF). This study focuses on the involvement of SlARF4 in tomato tolerance to salinity and osmotic stress. Using a reverse genetic approach, we found that the antisense down-regulation of SlARF4 promotes root development and density, increases soluble sugars content and maintains chlorophyll content at high levels under stress conditions. Furthermore, ARF4-as displayed higher tolerance to salt and osmotic stress through reduced stomatal conductance coupled with increased leaf relative water content and ABA content under normal and stressful conditions. This increase in ABA content was correlated with the activation of ABA biosynthesis genes and the repression of ABA catabolism genes. cat1, Cu/ZnSOD and mdhar genes were up-regulated in ARF4-as plants which can result in a better tolerance to salt and osmotic stress. A CRISPR/Cas9 induced SlARF4 mutant showed similar growth and stomatal responses as ARF4-as plants, which suggest that arf4-cr can tolerate salt and osmotic stresses. Our data support the involvement of ARF4 as a key factor in tomato tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses and confirm the use of CRISPR technology as an efficient tool for functional reverse genetics studies.",

The oscillatory activity of neurons contains information about the mental state of an individual, and the transition between physiological brain states is largely controlled by neuromodulators. Manipulating neural activity, brain rhythms or synchronization is of significant therapeutic interest in several neurological disorders and can be achieved by different means such as transcranial current and magnetic stimulation techniques, and by light through optogenetics, although the clinical translation of the latter is hampered by the need of gene therapy. Here, we directly modulate brain rhythms with light using a novel photoswitchable muscarinic agonist. Synchronous slow wave activity is transformed into a higher frequency pattern in the cerebral cortex both in slices in vitro and in anesthetized mice. These results open the way to the study of the neuromodulation and control of spatiotemporal patterns of activity and pharmacology of brain states, their transitions, and their links to cognition and behavior, in different organisms without requiring any genetic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Inherent nanometer-sized features and molecular recognition properties make DNA a useful material in constructing nanoscale objects, with alluring applications in biosensing and drug delivery. However, DNA can be easily degraded by nucleases present in biological fluids, posing a considerable roadblock to realizing the full potential of DNA nanotechnology for biomedical applications. Here we investigated the nuclease resistance and biostability of the multi-stranded motif called paranemic crossover (PX) DNA and discovered a remarkable and previously unreported resistance to nucleases. We show that PX DNA has more than an order of magnitude increased resistance to degradation by DNase I, serum, and urine compared to double stranded DNA. We further demonstrate that the degradation resistance decreases monotonically as DNA crossovers are removed from the structure, suggesting that frequent DNA crossovers disrupt either the binding or catalysis of nucleases or both. Further, we show using mouse and human cell lines that PX DNA does not affect cell proliferation or interfere with biological processes such as myogenesis. These results have important implications for building DNA nanostructures with enhanced biostability, either by adopting PX-based architectures or by carefully engineering crossovers. We contend that such crossover-dependent nuclease resistance could potentially be used to add \"tunable biostability\" to the many features of DNA nanotechnology.",

Less is known about neural network connectivity during social interactions involving trust, however, particularly as a function of closeness between an investor and a trustee. We examined network reactivity and connectivity in participants who played an economic trust game with close friends, strangers and a computer. Network reactivity analyses showed enhanced activation of the DMN to social relative to non-social outcomes. A novel network psychophysiological interaction analysis (nPPI) revealed enhanced connectivity between the DMN and the superior frontal gyrus and superior parietal lobule when experiencing reciprocated vs. violated trust from friends relative to strangers. Such connectivity tracked with differences in self-reported social closeness with these partners. Interestingly, reactivity of the executive control network (ECN), involved in decision processes, demonstrated no social vs. non-social preference, and ECN-ventral striatum (VS) connectivity did not track social closeness. Taken together, these novel findings suggest that DMN interacts with components of attention and control networks to signal the relative importance of positive experiences with close others vs. strangers.",

We previously reported that copper in liquid form is a promising candidate due to its potent larvicide properties in a laboratory setting and even in the field. In the field study, several larvae survived in the ovitrap due to the dilution of copper concentration by the rain. The surviving larvae were smaller and less motile. This led our interest to study the effect of a sub-lethal dose of copper in ovitrap on larvae development, pupation time and lifespan in the adult stage.\n\nMethodsFirst instar larvae of three species of mosquito (Aedes albopictus, Culex pipiens and Anopheles stephensi) were bred in copper-treated water at a concentration of 0.60 ppm, 0.30 ppm, and 0.15 ppm and compared with the control group. The surviving larvae were recorded every day in terms of pupa emerging time and adult emerging time. The number of adult mortality was recorded and compared with the control.\n\nResultsCopper showed potent larvicide effect in the 0.60 ppm concentration and prolonged pupation time and caused a significantly lower number of emerging mosquitoes down to the lowest concentration of 0.15 ppm. The adult lifespan was not different compared to the control.\n\nConclusionThis study demonstrates the capability of copper below 1 ppm to prolong the pupation time and the emerging time of mosquito larvae. Our findings open the possibility of copper application to cut mosquito breeding capacity that eventually will reduce disease transmission.",

Cellular transcriptomes as well as accessible chromatin landscapes can be compared to spatial transcript patterns in the developing mammalian brain, which enables characterization and visualization of organoid cell compositions.

    "abstract": "Meta-analyses are frequently used to quantify the difference in the average values of two groups (e.g., control and experimental treatment groups), but examine the difference in the variability (variance) of two groups. For such comparisons, the two relatively new effect size statistics, namely the log-transformed  variability ratio (the ratio of two standard deviations; lnVR) and the log-transformed  CV ratio (the ratio of two coefficients of variation; lnCVR) are useful. In practice, lnCVR may be of most use because a treatment may affect the mean and the variance simultaneously. We review current, and propose new, estimators for lnCVR and lnVR. We also present methods for use when the two groups are dependent (e.g., for cross-over and pre-test-post-test designs). A simulation study evaluated the performance of these estimators and we make recommendations about which estimators one should use to minimise bias. We also present two worked examples that illustrate the importance of accounting for the dependence of the two groups. We found that the degree to which dependence is accounted for in the sampling variance estimates can impact heterogeneity parameters such as{tau} 2 (i.e., the between-study variance) and I2 (i.e., the proportion of the total variability due to between-study variance), and even the overall effect, and in turn qualitative interpretations. Meta-analytic comparison of the variability between two groups enables us to ask completely new questions and to gain fresh insights from existing datasets. We encourage researchers to take advantage of these convenient new effect size measures for the meta-analysis of variation.",

    "abstract": "The cellular cortex is an approximately 200-nm-thick actin network that lies just beneath the cell membrane. It is responsible for the mechanical properties of cells, and as such, it is involved in many cellular processes, including cell migration and cellular interactions with the environment. To develop a clear view of this dense structure, high-resolution imaging is essential. As one such technique, electron microscopy, involves complex sample preparation procedures. The final drying of these samples has significant influence on potential artifacts, like cell shrinkage and the formation of artifactual holes in the actin cortex. In this study, we compared the three most used final sample drying procedures: critical-point drying (CPD), CPD with lens tissue (CPD-LT), and hexamethyldisilazane drying. We show that both hexamethyldisilazane and CPD-LT lead to fewer artifactual mesh holes within the actin cortex than CPD. Moreover, CPD-LT leads to significant reduction in cell height compared to hexamethyldisilazane and CPD. We conclude that the final drying procedure should be chosen according to the reduction in cell height, and so CPD-LT, or according to the spatial separation of the single layers of the actin cortex, and so hexamethyldisilazane.",

    "abstract": "Plasticity of cancer metabolism can be a major obstacle for efficient targeting of tumour-specific metabolic vulnerabilities. Here, we identify and quantify the compensatory mechanisms following the inhibition of major pathways of central carbon metabolism in c-MYC-induced liver tumours. We find that glutaminase isoform Gls2, expressed in normal liver, compensates for the deletion of Gls1 isoform expressed in tumours. Inhibiting both glutaminases significantly delays tumourigenesis but does not completely block glutamine catabolism through the Krebs cycle. We reveal that glutamine catabolism is then driven by amidotransferases. Consistently, the synergistic effect of glutaminase and amidotransferase inhibitors on proliferation of mouse and human tumour cells is observed in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, when Gls1 is deleted the Krebs cycle activity and tumour formation can also be significantly affected if glycolysis is co-inhibited (Gls1KO/Hk2KO). Finally, the inhibition of either serine (Psat1KO) or fatty acid (FasnKO) biosynthesis can be compensated by uptake of circulating nutrients. Thus, removing these nutrients from the diet produces synergistic effects on suppression of tumourigenesis. These results highlight the high flexibility of tumour metabolism and demonstrate how targeting compensatory mechanisms can improve a therapeutic outcome.",

    "abstract": "The time frame and geographical patterns of diversification processes in European temperate-montane herbs are still not well understood. We used the sexual species of the Ranunculus auricomus complex as a model system to understand how vicariance vs. dispersal processes in the context of Pleistocene climatic fluctuations have triggered speciation in temperate-montane plant species. We employed Target Enrichment sequence data from about 600 nuclear genes and coalescent-based species tree inference methods to resolve phylogenetic relationships among the sexual taxa of the complex. We estimated absolute divergence times and, using ancestral range reconstruction, we tested if speciation was rather enhanced by vicariance or dispersal processes.\n\nPhylogenetic relationships among taxa were fully resolved. Incongruence among species trees mainly concerned the intraspecific relationships in R. notabilis s.l., R. cassubicifolius s.l., and the position of the tetraploid R. marsicus. Speciation events took place in a very short time at the end of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (830-580 ka). A second wave of intraspecific geographical differentiation within and around the European mountain systems happened between 200-100 ka. Ancestral range reconstruction supports the existence of a widespread European ancestor of the R. auricomus complex. Vicariance processes have triggered allopatric speciation in temperate-montane plant species during the climatic deterioration occurred in the last phase of the Mid-Pleistocene Transition. Vegetation restructuring from forest into tundra could have confined these forest species into isolated glacial refugia. During subsequent warming periods, range expansions of these locally distributed species could have been hampered by congeneric competitors in the same habitat.",

The effect size of ABCG2 rs2231142 on urate is [~]60% that of SLC2A9, yet the effect size on gout is greater. We tested the hypothesis that ABCG2 plays a role in the progression from HU to gout by testing for association of ABCG2 rs2231142 and rs10011796 with gout using HU controls.\n\nMethodsWe analysed 1,699 European gout cases and 14,350 normourciemic (NU) and HU controls, and 912 New Zealand (NZ) Polynesian (divided into Eastern and Western Polynesian) gout cases and 696 controls. Association testing was performed using logistic and linear regression with multivariate adjusting for confounding variables.\n\nResultsIn Europeans and Polynesians, the ABCG2 141K (T) allele was associated with gout using HU controls (OR=1.85, P=3.8E-21 and ORmeta =1.85, P=1.3E-03, respectively). There was evidence for an effect of 141K in determining HU in European (OR=1.56, P=1.7E-18) but not in Polynesian (ORmeta=1.49, P=0.057). For SLC2A9 rs11942223, the T allele associated with gout in the presence of HU in European (OR=1.37, P=4.7E-06), however significantly weaker than ABCG2 rs2231142 141K (PHet=0.0023). In Western Polynesian and European, there was epistatic interaction between ABCG2 rs2231142 and the genetically-independent rs10011796. Combining the presence of the 141K allele with the rs10011796 CC-genotype increased gout risk, in the presence of HU, 21.5-fold in Western Polynesian (P=0.009) and 2.6-fold in European (P=9.9E-06). The 141K allele positively associated with flare frequency in Polynesian (Pmeta =2.5E-03).\n\nConclusionThese data are consistent with a role for ABCG2 141K in gout in the presence of established HU.",

    "abstract": "The domestic cat (Felis catus) numbers over 94 million in the USA alone, occupies households as a companion animal, and, like humans, suffers from cancer and common and rare diseases. However, genome-wide sequence variant information is limited for this species. To empower trait analyses, a new cat genome reference assembly was developed from PacBio long sequence reads that significantly improve sequence representation and assembly contiguity. The whole genome sequences of 54 domestic cats were aligned to the reference to identify single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and structural variants (SVs). Across all cats, 16 SNVs predicted to have deleterious impacts and in a singleton state were identified as high priority candidates for causative mutations. One candidate was a stop gain in the tumor suppressor FBXW7. The SNV is found in cats segregating for feline mediastinal lymphoma and is a candidate for inherited cancer susceptibility. SV analysis revealed a complex deletion coupled with a nearby potential duplication event that was shared privately across three unrelated dwarfism cats and is found within a known dwarfism associated region on cat chromosome B1. This SV interrupted UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH), a gene involved in the biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycans. Importantly, UGDH has not yet been associated with human dwarfism and should be screened in undiagnosed patients. The new high-quality cat genome reference and the compilation of sequence variation demonstrate the importance of these resources when searching for disease causative alleles in the domestic cat and for identification of feline biomedical models.\n\nAuthor summaryThe practice of genomic medicine is predicated on the availability of a high quality reference genome and an understanding of the impact of genome variation. Such resources have lead to countless discoveries in humans, however by working exclusively within the framework of human genetics, our potential for understanding diseases biology is limited, as similar analyses in other species have often lead to novel insights. The generation of Felis_catus_9.0, a new high quality reference genome for the domestic cat, helps facilitate the expansion of genomic medicine into the felis lineage. Using Felis_catus_9.0 we analyze the landscape of genomic variation from a collection of 54 cats within the context of human gene constraint. The distribution of variant impacts in cats is correlated with patterns of gene constraint in humans, indicating the utility of this reference for identifying novel mutations that cause phenotypes relevant to human and cat health. Moreover, structural variant analysis revealed a novel variant for feline dwarfism in UGDH, a gene that has not been associated with dwarfism in any other species, suggesting a role for UGDH in cases of undiagnosed dwarfism in humans.",

    "abstract": "Less than half of human zygotes survive to live birth, primarily due to aneuploidies of meiotic or mitotic origin. Mitotic errors lead to chromosomal mosaicism, defined by multiple cell lineages with distinct chromosome complements. The incidence and fitness consequences of chromosomal mosaicism in human embryos remain controversial, with most previous studies based on bulk DNA assays or comparisons of multiple biopsies of a few embryonic cells. Single-cell genomic data provide an opportunity to quantify mosaicism on an embryo-wide scale. To this end, we extended an approach to infer aneuploidies based on chromosome dosage-associated changes in gene expression by integrating signatures of allelic imbalance. We applied this method to published single-cell RNA sequencing data from 74 disaggregated human embryos, spanning the morula to blastocyst stages. Our analysis revealed widespread mosaic aneuploidies across preimplantation development, with 59 of 74 (80%) embryos harboring at least one aneuploid cell (1% FDR). By clustering copy number calls, we reconstructed histories of chromosome mis-segregation, distinguishing meiotic and early mitotic errors from those occurring after lineage differentiation. We observed no significant enrichment of aneuploid cells in the trophectoderm compared to the inner cell mass, though we do detect such an enrichment in published data from later post-implantation stages. Finally, we observed that aneuploid cells exhibit upregulation of immune response genes, as well as downregulation of genes involved in proliferation, metabolism, and protein processing, consistent with stress responses previously documented in other stages and systems. Together, our work provides a high-resolution view of aneuploidy in preimplantation embryos and supports the conclusion that low-level mosaicism is a common feature of early human development.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsIn most autoimmune disorders, crosstalk of B cells and CD4 T cells results in the accumulation of autoantibodies. In autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), the presence of anti-Soluble Liver Antigen (SLA or SepSecs) autoantibodies is associated with significantly reduced overall survival, but the associated autoreactive CD4 T cells have not been characterized yet. Here we isolated and deeply characterized SLA-specific CD4 T cells in AIH patients.\n\nMethodsWe used brief ex vivo restimulation with overlapping SLA-derived peptides to isolate and phenotype circulating SLA-specific CD4 T cells, and integrative single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to characterize their transcriptome and TCR repertoire in n=5 AIH patients. SLA-specific CD4 T cells were tracked in peripheral blood through TCR sequencing, to identify their phenotypic niche. We further characterized disease-associated peripheral blood T cells by high content flow cytometry in an additional cohort of n=46 AIH patients and n=18 non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) controls.\n\nResultsAutoreactive SLA-specific CD4 T cells were only detected in patients with anti-SLA autoantibodies and had a memory PD-1+CXCR5-CCR6-CD27+ phenotype. ScRNA-seq revealed their pro-inflammatory/B-Helper profile (IL21, IFNG, TIGIT, CTLA4, NR3C1, CD109, KLRB1 and CLEC2D). Autoreactive TCR clonotypes were restricted to the memory PD-1+CXCR5- CD4 T cells. This subset was significantly increased in the blood of AIH patients and supported B cell differentiation through IL-21. Finally, we identified a specific phenotype (PD-1+CD38+CD27+CD127-CXCR5-) of CD4 T cells linked to disease activity and IgG response during AIH.\n\nConclusionsThis work provides for the first time a deep characterization of rare circulating autoreactive CD4 T cells and the identification of their peripheral reservoir in AIH. We also propose a generic phenotype of pathogenic CD4 T cells related to AIH disease activity.",

Loss of PAS resulted in losses of H3K27 methylation concentrated near the chromosome ends and derepression of a subset of associated subtelomeric genes. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry confirmed reciprocal interactions between PAS and known PRC2 subunits, and sequence similarity searches demonstrated that PAS is not unique to N. crassa.

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction is an important first step in the analysis of single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data. In addition to enabling the visualization of the profiled cells, such representations are used by many downstream analyses methods ranging from pseudo-time reconstruction to clustering to alignment of scRNA-seq data from different experiments, platforms, and labs. Both supervised and unsupervised methods have been proposed to reduce the dimension of scRNA-seq. However, all methods to date are sensitive to batch effects. When batches correlate with cell types, as is often the case, their impact can lead to representations that are batch rather than cell type specific. To overcome this we developed a domain adversarial neural network model for learning a reduced dimension representation of scRNA-seq data. The adversarial model tries to simultaneously optimize two objectives. The first is the accuracy of cell type assignment and the second is the inability to distinguish the batch (domain). We tested the method by using the resulting representation to align several different datasets. As we show, by overcoming batch effects our method was able to correctly separate cell types, improving on several prior methods suggested for this task. Analysis of the top features used by the network indicates that by taking the batch impact into account, the reduced representation is much better able to focus on key genes for each cell type.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTracking dispersal of microbial populations in the environment requires specific detection methods that discriminate between the target strain and all potential natural and artificial interferents, including previously utilized tester strains. Recent work has shown that genomic insertion of short identification tags, called \"barcodes\" here, allows detection of chromosomally tagged strains by real-time PCR. Manual design of these barcodes is feasible for small sets, but expansion of the technique to larger pools of distinct and well-functioning assays would be significantly aided by software-guided design.\n\nResultsHere we introduce barCoder, a bioinformatics tool that facilitates the process of creating sets of uniquely identifiable barcoded strains. barCoder utilizes the genomic sequence of the target strain and a set of user-specified PCR parameters to generate a list of suggested barcode \"modules\" that consist of binding sites for primers and probes and appropriate spacer sequences. Each module is designed to yield optimal PCR amplification and unique identification. Optimal amplification includes metrics such as ideal Tm and G+C-content, appropriate spacing, and minimal stem-loop formation; unique identification includes low BLAST hits against the target organism, previously generated barcode modules, and databases, such as NCBI. We tested the ability of our algorithm to suggest appropriate barcodes by generating 12 modules for Bacillus thuringiensis serovar kurstaki, a simulant for the potential biowarfare agent Bacillus anthracis, and three each for other potential target organisms with variable G+C content. Real-time PCR detection assays directed at barcodes were specific and yielded minimal cross-reactivity with a panel of near-neighbor and potential contaminant materials.\n\nConclusionsThe barCoder algorithm facilitates the generation of barcoded biological simulants by (a) eliminating the task of creating modules by hand, (b) minimizing optimization of PCR assays, and (c) reducing effort wasted on non-unique barcode modules.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe task of protein sequence design is central to nearly all rational protein engineering problems, and enormous effort has gone into the development of energy functions to guide design. We investigate the capability of a deep neural network model to automate design of sequences onto protein backbones, having learned directly from crystal structure data and without any human-specified priors. The model generalizes to native topologies not seen during training, producing experimentally stable designs. We evaluate the generalizability of our method to a de novo TIM-barrel scaffold. The model produces novel sequences, and high-resolution crystal structures of two designs show excellent agreement with the in silico models. Our findings demonstrate the tractability of an entirely learned method for protein sequence design.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need to define mechanisms underlying pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDA) development. Our studies of ubiquitin ligases that may underlie PDA development led us to identify and characterize RNF125. We show that RNF125 exhibits nuclear expression in acinar cells, with reduced and largely cytosolic expression in ductal cells, PanIN and PDA specimens. We find that RNF125 interacts with histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and promotes its non-canonical K63-linked ubiquitination. Inhibition of HDAC2 activity by RNF125 resulted in elevated expression of the pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1). Correspondingly, inhibition of RNF125 expression enhanced organoid growth in culture and orthotopic tumor development. Conversely, restoration of PDX1 levels in human or mouse PDA cells and organoids depleted of RNF125, inhibited cell proliferation and growth, while expression of HDAC2 enhanced it. Notably, higher expression of RNF125 and PDX1 coincided with differentiated tumor phenotypes, and better outcome in PDA patients. In demonstrating the importance of RNF125 control of PDX1 expression via HDAC2 ubiquitination in PDA development, our findings highlight markers (RNF125, PDX1) and targets (HDAC2) for monitoring and possible treatment of PDA.",

    "abstract": "Metaxin 1 and 2 genes, previously investigated in vertebrates, are shown to be widely distributed among invertebrates. But metaxin 3 is absent. The predicted proteins of the invertebrate metaxins were initially identified by homology with human metaxin 1 and 2 proteins, and by the presence of characteristic GST_Metaxin protein domains. Invertebrate metaxins were revealed for a variety of phyla, including Echinodermata, Cnidaria, Porifera, Chordata, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Brachiopoda, Placozoa, and Nematoda. Metaxins were also found in insects (Arthropoda) of different taxonomic orders: Diptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera, and Blattodea. Invertebrate and human metaxin 1 proteins have about 41% identical amino acids, while metaxin 2 proteins have about 49% identities. Invertebrate and vertebrate metaxins share the same characteristic protein domains, further strengthening the identification of the invertebrate proteins as metaxins. The domains are, for metaxin 1, GST_N_Metaxin1_like, GST_C_Metaxin1_3, and Tom37. For metaxin 2, they are GST_N_Metaxin2, GST_C_Metaxin2, and Tom37. Phylogenetic trees show that invertebrate metaxin 1 and metaxin 2 proteins are related, but form separate groups. The invertebrate proteins are also closely related to vertebrate metaxins, though forming separate clusters. These phylogenetic results indicate that all metaxins likely arose from a common ancestral sequence. The neighboring genes of the invertebrate metaxin 1 and 2 genes are largely different for different invertebrate species. This is unlike the situation with vertebrate metaxin genes, where, for example, the metaxin 1 gene is adjacent to the thrombospondin 3 gene. The dominant secondary structures predicted for the invertebrate metaxins are alpha-helical segments, with little beta-strand. The conserved pattern of helical segments is the same as that found for vertebrate metaxins 1, 2, and 3.",

Presently, blood samples have been collected from over 800,000 enrolled participants. The size and diversity of the MVP cohort, as well as the availability of extensive VA electronic health records make it a promising resource for precision medicine. MVP is conducting array-based genotyping to provide genome-wide scan of the entire cohort, in parallel with whole genome sequencing, methylation, and other omics assays. Here, we present the design and performance of MVP 1.0 custom Axiom(R) array, which was designed and developed as a single assay to be used across the multi-ethnic MVP cohort. A unified genetic quality control analysis was developed and conducted on an initial tranche of 485,856 individuals leading to a high-quality dataset of 459,777 unique individuals. 668,418 genetic markers passed quality control and showed high quality genotypes not only on common variants but also on rare variants. We confirmed the substantial ancestral diversity of MVP with nearly 30% non-European individuals, surpassing other large biobanks. We also demonstrated the quality of the MVP dataset by replicating established genetic associations with height in European Americans and African Americans ancestries. This current data set has been made available to approved MVP researchers for genome-wide association studies and other downstream analyses. Further data releases will be available for analysis as recruitment at the VA continues and the cohort expands both in size and diversity.",

To overcome this limitation, the integration of magnetic properties into living systems enables a contact-less and orthogonal method for spatiotemporal control. Here, we generated a magnetic-sensing Escherichia coli by driving the formation of iron-rich bodies into bacteria. We found that these bacteria could be spatially controlled by magnetic forces and sustained cell growth and division, by transmitting asymmetrically their magnetic properties to one daughter cell. We combined the spatial control of bacteria with genetically encoded-adhesion properties to achieve the magnetic capture of specific target bacteria as well as the spatial modulation of human cell invasions.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale metabolic models are widely constructed and studied for understanding various design principles underlying metabolism, predominantly redundancy. Metabolic networks are highly redundant and it is possible to minimise the metabolic networks into smaller networks that retain the functionality of the original network. Here, we establish a new method, MO_SCPLOWINC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEACTC_SCPLOW that systematically removes reactions from a given network to identify minimal reactome(s). We show that our method identifies smaller minimal reactomes than existing methods and also scales well to larger metabolic networks. Notably, our method exploits known aspects of network structure and redundancy to identify multiple minimal metabolic networks. We illustrate the utility of MO_SCPLOWINC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEACTC_SCPLOW by identifying multiple minimal networks for 74 organisms from the BiGG database. We show that these multiple minimal reactomes arise due to the presence of compensatory reactions/pathways. We further employed MO_SCPLOWINC_SCPLOWRO_SCPLOWEACTC_SCPLOW for a case study to identify the minimal reactomes of different organisms in both glucose and xylose minimal environments. Identification of minimal reactomes of these different organisms elucidate that they exhibit varying levels of redundancy. A comparison of the minimal reactomes on glucose and xylose illustrate that the differences in the reactions required to sustain growth on either medium. Overall, our algorithm provides a rapid and reliable way to identify minimal subsets of reactions that are essential for survival, in a systematic manner.\n\nAuthor summaryAn organisms metabolism is routinely modelled by a metabolic network, which consists of all the enzyme-catalysed reactions that occur in the organism. These reactions are numerous, majorly due to the presence of redundant reactions that perform compensatory functions. Also, not all the reactions are functional in all environments and are unique to the environmental conditions. So, it is possible to minimise such large metabolic networks into smaller functional networks. Such minimal networks help in easier dissection of the capabilities of the network and also further our understanding of the various redundancies and other design principles occurring in these networks. Here, we have developed a new algorithm for identification of such minimal networks, that is efficient and superior to existing algorithms. We show the utility of our algorithm in identifying such minimal sets of reactions for many known metabolic networks. We have also shown a case study, using our algorithm to identify such minimal networks for different organisms in varied nutrient conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOverweightness and obesity in dogs are associated with negative health outcomes. A better understanding of risk factors associated with canine weight is fundamental to identifying preventative interventions and treatments. In this cross-sectional study, we used a direct to consumer approach to collect body condition scores (BCS), as well as demographic, diet, and lifestyle data on 4,446 dogs. BCS was assessed by owners using a 9-point system and categorized as ideal (BCS 4-5), overweight (BCS 6), and obese (BCS 7+). Following univariate analyses, a stepwise procedure was used to select variables which were included in multivariate logistic regression models. One model was created to compare ideal to all overweight and obese dogs, and another was created to compare ideal to obese dogs only. We then used Elastic Net selection and XGBoost variable importance measures to validate these results.\n\nResultsOverall, 1,480 (33%) of dogs were reported to be overweight or obese, of which 356 (8% total) of dogs were reported to be obese. Seven factors were significantly associated with both overweightness/obesity and obesity alone in all three analyses (stepwise, Elastic Net, and XGBoost): diet composition, probiotic supplementation, treat quantity, exercise, age, food motivation level, and pet appetite. Neutering was also associated with overweightness/obesity in all analyses.\n\nConclusionsThis study recapitulated established risk factors associated with BCS (age, exercise, neutering). Moreover, we elucidated associations between previously examined risk factors and BCS (diet composition, treat consumption, and temperament) and identified a novel factor (probiotic supplementation). Specifically, relative to dogs on fresh food diets, BCS was higher in dogs eating dry food both alone and in combination with other foods. Furthermore, dogs receiving probiotics, but not other forms of supplementation, were more likely to have an ideal BCS. Future studies should corroborate these findings with experimental manipulations.",

    "abstract": "The glioblastoma (GBM) recurrence rate is high, despite multimodal treatment including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Most recurrences occur at the resection margin that is located outside the GBM contrast-enhancing region (C region) of magnetic resonance imaging. However, the nature of the GBM cells that lie outside the C region is unclear. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to compare 12 samples taken from inside and outside the C region from four patients with GBM and identified a cluster of GBM cells outside the C region that exhibited fragmented CNVs in chromosomes such as 1, 10, 12 and 19 (herein termed CNV 4). A transcription factor-transcription cofactor interaction network was constructed to uncover the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of these CNV 4 GBM cells that had prognostic significance (p < 0.05). Furthermore, a sub-cluster of these CNV 4 GBM cells possessed stem cell-like properties and had tumorigenic potential. In parallel, we analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from four patients with GBM, three patients with epilepsy and three healthy volunteers by scRNA-seq. We identified a novel subtype of proliferative immune cells only in patients with GBM. Overall, our findings indicate that CNV 4 cells might contribute to GBM recurrence and proliferative circulating immune cells are specific to patients with GBM. This study sheds light on a neglected aspect of GBM, and opens new avenues to explore GBM recurrence and immunotherapy.\n\nSignificanceWe show that a subset of GBM cells outside the C region possess the properties of stem cell and tumorigenesis potential, which might be responsible for cancer recurrence. Besides, proliferative lymphocytes are specific to the PBMCs of patients with GBM, which could help to develop novel immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Candida auris has emerged globally as a multidrug-resistant yeast that can spread via nosocomial transmission. An initial phylogenetic study of isolates from Japan, India, Pakistan, South Africa, and Venezuela revealed four populations (Clades I, II, III, and IV) corresponding to these geographic regions. Since this description, C. auris has been reported in over 30 additional countries. To trace this global emergence, we compared the genomes of 304 C. auris isolates from 19 countries on six continents. We found that four predominant clades persist across wide geographic locations. We observed phylogeographic mixing in most clades; Clade IV, with isolates mainly from South America, demonstrated the strongest phylogeographic substructure. C. auris isolates from two clades with opposite mating types were detected contemporaneously in a single healthcare facility in Kenya. We estimated a Bayesian molecular clock phylogeny and dated the origin of each clade within the last 339 years; outbreak-causing clusters from Clades I, III, and IV originated 34-35 years ago. We observed high rates of antifungal resistance in Clade I, including four isolates resistant to all three major classes of antifungals. Mutations that contribute to resistance varied between the clades, with Y132F in ERG11 as the most widespread mutation associated with azole resistance and S639P in FKS1 for echinocandin resistance. Copy number variants in ERG11 predominantly appeared in Clade III and were associated with fluconazole resistance. These results provide a global context for the phylogeography, population structure, and mechanisms associated with antifungal resistance in C. auris.\n\nImportanceIn less than a decade, C. auris has emerged in healthcare settings worldwide; this species is capable of colonizing skin and causing outbreaks of invasive candidiasis. In contrast to other Candida species, C. auris is unique in its ability to spread via nosocomial transmission and its high rates of drug resistance. As part of the public health response, whole-genome sequencing has played a major role in characterizing transmission dynamics and detecting new C. auris introductions. Through a global collaboration, we assessed genome evolution of isolates of C. auris from 19 countries. Here, we described estimated timing of the expansion of each C. auris clade and of fluconazole resistance, characterized discrete phylogeographic population structure of each clade, and compared genome data to sensitivity measurements to describe how antifungal resistance mechanisms vary across the population. These efforts are critical for a sustained, robust public health response that effectively utilizes molecular epidemiology.",

A greater knowledge of the intricate cellular milieu of the heart is critical to increase our understanding of cardiac homeostasis and pathology. As recent advances in low input RNA-sequencing have allowed definitions of cellular transcriptomes at single cell resolution at scale, here we have applied these approaches to assess the cellular and transcriptional diversity of the non-failing human heart.\n\nMethodsMicrofluidic encapsulation and barcoding was used to perform single nuclear RNA sequencing with samples from seven human donors, selected for their absence of overt cardiac disease. Individual nuclear transcriptomes were then clustered based upon transcriptional profiles of highly variable genes. These clusters were used as the basis for between-chamber and between-sex differential gene expression analyses and intersection with genetic and pharmacologic data\n\nResultsWe sequenced the transcriptomes of 287,269 single cardiac nuclei, revealing a total of 9 major cell types and 20 subclusters of cell types within the human heart. Cellular subclasses include two distinct groups of resident macrophages, four endothelial subtypes, and two fibroblasts subsets. Comparisons of cellular transcriptomes by cardiac chamber or sex reveal diversity not only in cardiomyocyte transcriptional programs, but also in subtypes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and vascularization. Using genetic association data, we identified strong enrichment for the role of cell subtypes in cardiac traits and diseases. Finally, intersection of our dataset with genes on cardiac clinical testing panels and the druggable genome reveals striking patterns of cellular specificity.\n\nConclusionsUsing large-scale single nuclei RNA sequencing, we have defined the transcriptional and cellular diversity in the normal human heart. Our identification of discrete cell subtypes and differentially expressed genes within the heart will ultimately facilitate the development of new therapeutics for cardiovascular diseases.",

    "abstract": "While glacier ice cores provide climate information over tens to hundreds of thousands of years, study of microbes is challenged by ultra-low-biomass conditions, and virtually nothing is known about co-occurring viruses. Here we establish ultra-clean microbial and viral sampling procedures and apply them to two ice cores from the Guliya ice cap (northwestern Tibetan Plateau, China) to study these archived communities. This method reduced intentionally contaminating bacterial, viral, and free DNA to background levels in artificial-ice-core control experiments, and was then applied to two authentic ice cores to profile their microbes and viruses. The microbes differed significantly across the two ice cores, presumably representing the very different climate conditions at the time of deposition that is similar to findings in other cores. Separately, viral particle enrichment and ultra-low-input quantitative viral metagenomic sequencing from [~]520 and [~]15,000 years old ice revealed 33 viral populations (i.e., species-level designations) that represented four known genera and likely 28 novel viral genera (assessed by gene-sharing networks). In silico host predictions linked 18 of the 33 viral populations to co-occurring abundant bacteria, including Methylobacterium, Sphingomonas, and Janthinobacterium, indicating that viruses infected several abundant microbial groups. Depth-specific viral communities were observed, presumably reflecting differences in the environmental conditions among the ice samples at the time of deposition. Together, these experiments establish a clean procedure for studying microbial and viral communities in low-biomass glacier ice and provide baseline information for glacier viruses, some of which appear to be associated with the dominant microbes in these ecosystems.\n\nImportanceThis study establishes ultra-clean microbial and viral sampling procedures for glacier ice, which complements prior in silico decontamination methods and expands, for the first time, the clean procedures to viruses. Application of these methods to glacier ice confirmed prior common microbiological findings for a new ice core climate record, and provides a first window into viral genomes and their ecology from glacier ice across two time horizons, and emphasizes their likely impact on abundant microbial groups. Together these efforts provide clean sampling approaches and foundational datasets that should enable simultaneous access to an archived virosphere in glacier ice.",

    "abstract": "In mitosis, while the importance of kinetochore-microtubule attachment has been known for many years, increasing evidence suggests that telomere dysfunctions also perturb chromosome segregation by contributing to the formation of chromatin bridges at anaphase. Recent evidence suggests that Aurora B ensures proper chromosome segregation during mitosis not only by controlling kinetochore-microtubule attachment but also by regulating telomere and chromosome arm separation. However, whether and how Aurora-B governs telomere separation during meiosis has remained unknown. Here, we show that fission yeast Aurora B localizes at telomeres during meiosis I and promotes telomere separation independently of the meiotic cohesin Rec8. In meiosis II, Aurora-B controls kinetochore-microtubule attachment but appears dispensable for telomere and chromosome arm separation. Likewise, condensin activity is nonessential in meiosis II for telomere and chromosome arm separation. Thus, in meiosis, the requirements for Aurora-B are distinct at centromeres and telomeres, illustrating the critical differences in the control of chromosome segregation between mitosis and meiosis II.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a common incurable neurodegenerative disease. The identification of genetic variants via genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has considerably advanced our understanding of the PD genetic risk. Understanding the functional significance of the risk loci is now a critical step towards translating these genetic advances into an enhanced biological understanding of the disease. Impaired mitophagy is a key causative pathway in familial PD, but its relevance to idiopathic PD is unclear. We used a mitophagy screening assay to evaluate the functional significance of risk genes identified through GWAS. We identified two new regulators of PINK1-mitophagy, KAT8 and KANSL1, previously shown to modulate lysine acetylation. We show that KAT8 and KANSL1 modulate PINK1 gene expression and subsequent PINK1-mitophagy. These findings suggest PINK1-mitophagy is a contributing factor to idiopathic PD. KANSL1 is located on chromosome 17q21 where the risk associated gene has long been considered to be MAPT. While our data does not exclude a possible association between the MAPT gene and PD, it provides strong evidence that KANSL1 plays a crucial role in the disease. Finally, these results enrich our understanding of physiological events regulating mitophagy and establish a novel pathway for drug targeting in neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "While serving as environmental reservoir for V. cholerae infection, biofilms are also crucial for intestinal colonization of the pathogen. Triterpenoids, a group of bioactive phytochemicals, have been tested for antibiofilm activity against model biofilm forming bacteria in recent times. In this context, glycyrrhetinic acid (GRA), ursolic acid (UA) and betulinic acid (BA), representing three categorically distinct groups of pentacyclic triterpenoids, are targeted for profiling their impact on Vibrio cholerae C6709 biofilms. The triterpenoids substantially affected biofilm associated attributes like formation, substratum adherence and dispersion from preformed biofilms. Though at variable degree, the compounds decreased cell surface hydrophobicity and composition in terms of macromolecular content. Not only EPS-associated extracellular enzyme activities were estimated to be reduced by triterpenoid exposure, ultra structural analysis also revealed that GRA, UA and BA can affect extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content. Albeit total extracellular proteolytic activity remained unaffected by the triterpenoids, GRA treatment resulted in considerable reduction of extracellular gelatinase activity. Molecular docking analysis indicated potential interaction with cyclic di-GMP sensor VpsT, autoinducer-2 sensor kinase LuxP-LuxQ and transcriptional activator HapR, component of complex quorum sensing networks modulating biofilm formation. Comprehensive analysis of antibiotic action revealed accentuation of cephalosporin antibiotics with GRA and UA while BA potentiated action of fluoroquinolones, widening the scope of combinatorial therapeutic strategy.",

Successful evaluation of candidate therapeutics will be facilitated by validated noninvasive biomarkers of aspects of disease pathology recapitulated by animal models.\n\nObjectiveWe sought to identify shared neurochemical signatures in two mouse models of SCA3 that reflect aspects of the human disease pathology.\n\nMethodsCerebellar neurochemical concentrations in homozygous YACMJD84.2 (Q84/Q84) and hemizygous CMVMJD135 (Q135) mice were measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 9.4 tesla. Motivated by the shared neurochemical abnormalities in the two models, we determined the levels of neurofilament medium (NFL, indicator of neuroaxonal integrity) and myelin basic protein (MBP, indicator of myelination) in cerebellar lysates from a subset of mice and from patients with SCA3. Finally, NFL and MBP levels were measured in cerebellar extracts of Q84/Q84 mice upon sustained silencing of the mutant ATXN3 gene from 6-8 weeks-of-age until death.\n\nResultsBoth Q84/Q84 and Q135 mice displayed lower N-acetylaspartate than wild-type littermates, indicating neuroaxonal loss/dysfunction, and lower myo-inositol and total choline, indicating disturbances in phospholipid membrane metabolism and demyelination. Cerebellar NFL and MBP levels were accordingly lower in both models as well as in the cerebellar cortex of patients with SCA3 than controls. Furthermore, long-term sustained RNAi-mediated reduction of ATXN3 levels increased NFL and MBP in Q84/Q84 cerebella.\n\nConclusionsN-acetylaspartate, myo-inositol and total choline levels in the cerebellum are candidate biomarkers of neuroaxonal and oligodendrocyte pathology in SCA3, which are reversible by reduction of mutant ATXN3 levels.",

However, thus far, individual variability of ACs has been considered a methodological impediment rather than a phenomenon of theoretical importance. Here, we examined the variability of ACs using intrinsic functional connectivity patterns in humans and macaques. Our results demonstrate that in humans, functional variability is 1) greater near the non-primary than primary ACs, 2) greater in ACs than comparable visual areas, and 3) greater in the left than right ACs. Remarkably similar modality differences and lateralization of variability were observed in macaques. These connectivity-based findings are consistent with a confirmatory task-based fMRI analysis. The quantitative proof of the exceptional variability of ACs has implications for understanding the evolution of advanced auditory functions in humans.",

    "abstract": "Siberian larch (Larix Mill.) forests dominate vast areas of northern Russia and contribute important ecosystem services to the world. It is important to understand the past dynamics of larches, in order to predict their likely response to a changing climate in the future. Sedimentary ancient DNA extracted from lake sediment cores can serve as archives to study past vegetation. However, the traditional method of studying sedimentary ancient DNA - metabarcoding - focuses on small fragments which cannot resolve Larix to species level nor allow the detailed study of population dynamics. Here we use shotgun sequencing and hybridization capture with long-range PCR-generated baits covering the complete Larix chloroplast genome to study Larix populations from a sediment core reaching back up to 6700 years in age from the Taymyr region in northern Siberia. In comparison to shotgun sequencing, hybridization capture results in an increase of taxonomically classified reads by several orders of magnitude and the recovery of near-complete chloroplast genomes of Larix. Variation in the chloroplast reads corroborate an invasion of Larix gmelinii into the range of Larix sibirica before 6700 years ago. Since then, both species have been present at the site, although larch populations have decreased with only a few trees remaining in what was once a forested area. This study demonstrates for the first time that hybridization capture applied to ancient DNA from lake sediments can provide genome-scale information and is a viable tool for studying past changes of a specific taxon.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently controlling the movement of our hand requires coordinating the motion of multiple joints of the arm. Although it is widely assumed that this type of efficient control is implemented by processing that occurs in the cerebral cortex and brain stem, recent work has shown that spinal circuits can generate efficient motor output that supports keeping the hand in a static location. Here, we show that a spinal pathway can also efficiently control the hand during reaching. In our first experiment we applied multi-joint mechanical perturbations to participants elbow and wrist as they began reaching towards a target. We found that spinal stretch reflexes evoked in elbow muscles were not proportional to how much the elbow muscles were stretched but instead were efficiently scaled to the hands distance from the target. In our second experiment we applied the same elbow and wrist perturbations but had participants change how they grasped the manipulandum, diametrically altering how the same wrist perturbation moved the hand relative to the reach target. We found that changing the arms orientation diametrically altered how spinal reflexes in the elbow muscles were evoked, and in such a way that were again efficiently scaled to the hands distance from the target. These findings demonstrate that spinal circuits can help efficiently control the hand during dynamic reaching actions, and show that efficient and flexible motor control is not exclusively dependent on processing that occurs within supraspinal regions of the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveHippocampal volume is a sensitive marker of neurodegeneration and a well-established predictor of age-related cognitive impairment. Recently, free-water (FW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has shown associations with pathology in Alzheimers disease (AD), but it is still unclear whether these metrics are associated with measures of cognitive impairment. Here, we investigate whether FW and FW-corrected fractional anisotropy (FAT) within medial temporal lobe white matter tracts (cingulum, fornix, uncinate fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and tapetum) provides meaningful contribution to cognition and cognitive decline beyond hippocampal volume.\n\nParticipants and MethodsVanderbilt Memory & Aging Project participants (n=319, 73{+/-}7 years, 59% male) with normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (40% of cohort) underwent baseline brain MRI, including structural MRI to quantify hippocampal volume, diffusion MRI to quantify medial temporal lobe white matter tract FW and FAT, and longitudinal neuropsychological assessment with a mean follow-up of 3.5 years. Linear regressions were conducted to determine how hippocampal volume and white matter tract FW and FAT interact with baseline memory and executive function performances. Competitive model analyses determined the unique variance provided by white matter tract FW and FAT beyond that of hippocampal volume and other comorbidities. Linear mixed-effects models were conducted to determine how baseline hippocampal volume and white matter tract FW and FAT interact to explain longitudinal change in memory and executive function performances.\n\nResultsFW in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, tapetum, uncinate fasciculus, and cingulum were robustly associated with baseline memory and executive function. Further, competitive model analysis showed that tract FW contributed unique variance beyond other comorbidities and hippocampal volume for memory ({Delta}Radj2 range: 0.82-2.00%) and executive function ({Delta}Radj2 range: 0.88-1.87%). Longitudinal analyses demonstrated significant interactions of hippocampal volume and FAT in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (p=0.02), tapetum (p=0.02), uncinate fasciculus (p=0.02), and cingulum (p=0.002) with decline in memory. For decline in executive function, we found significant interactions of hippocampal volume and FAT in inferior longitudinal fasciculus (p=0.03), tapetum (p=0.02), uncinate fasciculus (p=0.02), and fornix (p=0.02), as well as cingulum (p=0.02) and fornix (p=0.02) FW.\n\nConclusionsOur results highlight novel associations between FW and FAT measures of medial temporal lobe tract microstructure and cognitive performance such that individuals with smaller hippocampal volumes and lower tract microstructure experience greater cognitive decline. These results suggest that white matter has a unique role in cognitive decline and, therefore, could be used to provide better disease staging, allowing for more precise disease monitoring in AD.",

    "abstract": "It is generally assumed that the main function of the corticospinal tract (CST) is to convey motor commands to bulbar or spinal motoneurons. Yet the CST has also been shown to modulate sensory signals at their entry point in the spinal cord, through presynaptic inhibition. By sequentially investigating different routes of corticofugal pathways through electrophysiological recordings and an intersectional viral strategy, we here demonstrate that motor and sensory modulation commands in mice belong to segregated paths within the CST. Sensory modulation is excuted exclusively by the CST via a population of lumbar interneurons located in the deep dorsal horn. In contrast, the cortex conveys the motor command via a relay in the upper spinal cord or supraspinal motor centers. At lumbar level, the main role of the CST is thus the modulation of sensory inputs, which is an essential component of the selective tuning of sensory feedback, to ensure well-coordinated and skilled movement.\n\nImpact statementWhile the corticospinal tract is often considered exclusively as a motor path, this study demonstrates that, in the mouse lumbar cord, its main role is the modulation of sensory inputs.",

Here we develop a novel phototaxis assay for Drosophila larvae in which light intensity is always spatially uniform but updates depending on the location of the animal in the arena. Even though larvae can only rely on temporal cues in this closed-loop setup, we find that they are capable of finding preferred areas of low light intensity. Further detailed analysis of their behavior reveals that larvae turn more frequently and that heading angle changes increase when they experience brightness increments over extended periods of time. We suggest that temporal integration of brightness change during runs is an important - and so far largely unexplored - element of phototaxis.\n\nSummary statementUsing a novel closed-loop behavioral assay, we show that Drosophila larvae can navigate light gradients exclusively using temporal cues.

    "abstract": "Because of the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, identifying a statistical test that is both valid and maximally sensitive is an important challenge. Here, we present a combination of two approaches for fMRI data analysis that together result in substantial improvements of the sensitivity of cluster-based statistics. The first approach is to create novel cluster definitions that are sensitive to physiologically plausible effect patterns. The second is to adopt a new approach to combine test statistics with different sensitivity profiles, which we call the min(p) method. These innovations are made possible by using the randomization inference framework. In this paper, we report on a set of simulations that demonstrate (1) that the proposed methods control the false-alarm rate, (2) that the sensitivity profiles of cluster-based test statistics vary depending on the cluster defining thresholds and cluster definitions, and (3) that the min(p) method for combining these test statistics results in a drastic increase of sensitivity (up to five-fold), compared to existing fMRI analysis methods. This increase in sensitivity is not at the expense of the spatial specificity of the inference.",

    "abstract": "Learning to associate the context in which a stimulus occurs is an important aspect of animal learning. We propose that the association of an olfactory stimulus with its multisensory context is mediated by projections from ventral hippocampal networks (vHC) to the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON). Using a contextually-cued olfactory discrimination task, rats were trained to associate two olfactory stimuli with different responses depending on visuo-spatial context. Temporary lesions of the AON or vHC impaired performance on this task. In contrast, such lesions did not impair performance on a non-contextual olfactory discrimination task. Moreover, vHC lesions also impaired performance on an analogous contextually-cued texture discrimination task, whereas AON lesions affected only olfactory contextual associations. We describe a distinct role for the AON in olfactory processing, and conclude that early olfactory networks such as the olfactory bulb and AON function as multimodal integration networks rather than processing olfactory signals exclusively.\n\nSignificance statementContextual information has long been known to play a key role in cognitive functions such as memory and decision making. We here show the contextual modulation of neural information in early primary sensory networks and its effects on contextually conditional learned behavior. We propose that projections from ventral hippocampus to anterior olfactory nucleus convey contextual information to the early olfactory system, modulating sensory representations and olfactory perception. Using behavioral pharmacology and computational modeling, we show how established network structures can mediate multimodal information and use context to make olfactory decisions.",

    "abstract": "The differentiation of neurons and formation of connections between cells is the basis of both the adult phenotype and behaviors tied to cognition, perception, reproduction, and survival. Such behaviors are associated with local (circuits) and global (connectome) brain networks. A solid understanding of how these networks emerge is critical. This opinion piece features a guided tour of early developmental events in the emerging connectome, which is crucial to a new view on the connectogenetic process. Connectogenesis includes associating cell identities with broader functional and developmental relationships. During this process, the transition from developmental cells to terminally differentiated cells is defined by an accumulation of traits that ultimately results in neuronal-driven behavior. The well-characterized developmental and cell biology of C. elegans will be used to build a synthesis of developmental events that result in a functioning connectome. Specifically, our view of connectogenesis enables a first-mover model of synaptic connectivity to be demonstrated using data representing larval synaptogenesis. In a first-mover model of Stackleberg competition, potential pre- and postsynaptic relationships are shown to yield various strategies for establishing various types of synaptic connections. By comparing these results to what is known regarding principles for establishing complex network connectivity, these strategies are generalizable to other species and developmental systems. In conclusion, we will discuss the broader implications of this approach, as what is presented here informs an understanding of behavioral emergence and the ability to simulate related biological phenomena.\n\nHighlightsO_LIwe can understand the complexity of connectomes in terms of their emergence from embryogenetic precursors, connection dynamics, and relationship to organismal behavior.\nC_LIO_LIa first-mover competition model can explain how neuronal cells follow a specific set of heuristic strategies to form chemical synapses with other cells in larval development.\nC_LIO_LIthe timing and relative order of terminal differentiation in Caenorhabditis elegans are shown to have both subtle and consequential effects on patterns of connectivity.\nC_LIO_LIa correspondence is established between the emergence of small connectomes and the emergence of specific behavioral outcomes in both animal and in silico models.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The use of camera traps in animal ecology has transformed the field by allowing a greater quantity of detailed observations with limited human interference. One of largest camera trap studies published to date is from the Serengeti National Park (SNP) in Tanzania, East Africa which deployed 225 camera traps and obtained over 1.2 million pictures. This paper will focus primarily on the top predator of the Serengeti, the lion, and how it affects and is affected by prey, subordinate predators and the dramatic shift in the seasons. I asked the following three questions to better understand species relationships in the SNP: 1) Do the seasons in the SNP have an effect on the RAB of lions? 2) Does the presence or absence of lions have an effect on the RAB of hyenas in the wet season? 3) Does the presence/absence of Thompson gazelles (Eudorcas thomsonii) and impalas (Aepyceros melampus) in the wet season have an effect on the RAB of lions? During the dry and wet season of 2012 in the SNP there did not appear to be a change in the relative abundance of lions (Fig. 1), nor did lion relative abundance affect hyenas. The lions might possibly alter their diet during the dry seasons to include non-migratory species and choose not to change their territory on a season to season basis. Based on these findings research should focus on how the lions adapt to the changes in prey abundance during the wet and dry season. This preliminary analysis of the ecological dynamics of lions and associated species in the SNP is intriguing and yet raises significantly more questions than it has answered. Additional research surrounding the effects of yearly migration on the lions home territory, diet, and species interactions should be investigated more thoroughly, to greater understand the ecological relationships in the SNP.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/895409v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1808f9corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15453beorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@145e6ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@341460_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1.C_FLOATNO The relative abundance of lions in the dry and wet season in the Serengeti National Park observed by162 camera traps during 2012.

    "abstract": "The human oral microbiota is acquired early in an organized pattern, but the factors driving this acquisition are not well understood. Microbial \"heritability\" could have far-reaching consequences for health, yet no studies have specifically examined the fidelity with which the oral microbiota are passed from parents to offspring. Some previous studies comparing monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins had suggested that host genetics has a role in shaping oral microbial communities, and also identified so called \"heritable\" taxa. However, these findings are likely to be confounded by shared environmental factors resulting from the well-established greater behavioral similarity among MZ twins. In addition, MZ and DZ twins share an equal portion of their parents genome, and so this model is not informative for studying direct parent to offspring transmission.\n\nTo specifically examine the contribution of genetics to the fidelity of transmission of bacteria from parents to offspring, we used a novel study design comparing fraction of shared species and strains between our genetically related group consisting of children and their biological mothers, with that of children and their adoptive mothers, constituting our genetically unrelated group. Fifty-five biological and 50 adoptive mother-child pairs were recruited along with 23 biological fathers and 16 siblings. Subjects were carefully selected to ensure the two groups were matched on childs age. Three distinct habitats within the oral cavity: the saliva/soft tissue surface, supragingival biofilm, and subgingival biofilm, were sampled to comprehensively profile the oral microbiome. Our recently developed strategy for subspecies level characterization of bacterial communities by targeted sequencing of the ribosomal 16-23S intergenic spacer region (ISR) was utilized in the present study to track strain sharing between subjects, in addition to 16S rRNA gene sequencing for species analysis.\n\nResults showed that oral bacterial community profiles of adoptive and biological mother-child pairs were equally similar, indicating no effect of host genetics on the fidelity of transmission. This was consistent at both species and strain level resolutions, and across all three habitats sampled. We also found that all children more closely resembled their own mother as compared to unrelated women, suggesting that contact and shared environment were the major factors shaping the oral microbiota. Individual analysis of the most abundant species also did not detect any effect of host genetics on strain sharing between mother and child. Mother-child strain similarity increased with the age of the child, ruling out early effects that are lost over time. No effect on the fidelity of mother-child strain sharing from vaginal birth or breast feeding was seen. Analysis of extended families showed that fathers and mothers were equally similar to their children. Cohabitating couples showed even greater strain similarity than mother-child pairs, further supporting the role of age, contact and shared environment as determinants of microbial similarity.\n\nBased on these findings we suggest that the genetic effects on oral microbial acquisition observed in twin studies are more likely the result of confounding environmental factors based on greater behavioral similarity among MZ twins. Our findings suggest that these host mechanisms are universal to humans, since no effect of genetic relatedness on fidelity of microbial transmission could be detected. Instead, our findings point toward contact and shared environment being the driving factors of microbial transmission, with a unique combination of these factors ultimately shaping a highly personalized human oral microbiome.",

    "abstract": "When people can successfully recall a studied word, they should be able to recognize it as having been studied. In cued recall paradigms, however, participants sometimes correctly recall words in the presence of strong semantic cues but then fail to recognize those words as actually having been studied. Although the conditions necessary to produce this unusual effect are known, the underlying neural correlates have not been investigated. Across two experiments, involving both behavioral and electrophysiological methods (EEG), we investigated the cognitive and neural processes that underlie recognition failures. Experiments 1A and 1B showed that, in cued recall paradigms, presuming that recalled items can be recognized is a flawed assumption: Recognition failures occur in the presence of cues, regardless of whether those failures are measured. Experiment 2 showed that successfully recalled words that are recognized are driven by recollection at recall and by a combination of recollection and familiarity at recognition; in contrast, recognition failures are driven by semantic priming at recall and followed by negative-going ERP effects consistent with implicit processes such as repetition fluency and context familiarity at recognition. These results demonstrate that recall--long-characterized as predominantly reflecting recollection-based processing in episodic memory--can at times also be served by a confluence of implicit cognitive processes.",

    "abstract": "Sustained attention is a limited resource which declines during daily tasks. Such decay is exacerbated in clinical and aging populations. Recent research has demonstrated that inhibition of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) using low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation (LF-rTMS) can lead to an upregulation of functional communication within the attention network. Attributed to functional compensation for the inhibited node, this boost outlasts the stimulation for tens of minutes. Despite the neural change, no behavioral correlate has been found in healthy subjects, a necessary direct evidence of functional compensation. To understand the functional significance of neuromodulatory induced fluctuations on attention, we sought to boost the impact of LF-rTMS through controlling neural excitability prior to LF-rTMS, with the goal to impact behavior. Brain state was controlled using high-frequency transcranial random noise stimulation (HF-tRNS), shown to increase and stabilizes neuronal excitability. Using fMRI-guided stimulation protocols combining HF-tRNS and LF-rTMS, we tested the post-stimulation impact on sustained attention via a multiple object tracking task (MOT). Whilst attention deteriorated across time in the control conditions, HF-tRNS followed by LF-rTMS maintained attention performance up to 94 minutes, doubling the length of successful sustained attention. Multimethod stimulation was also more effective when targeting right IPS, supporting the notion of specialized attention processing in the right hemisphere. Used in a cognitive domain dependent on network-wide neural activity, this tool may be effective in causing lasting neural compensation important for clinical rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian visual system has been the focus of countless experimental and theoretical studies designed to elucidate principles of neural computation and sensory coding. Most theoretical work has focused on networks intended to reflect developing or mature neural circuitry, in both health and disease. Few computational studies have attempted to model changes that occur in neural circuitry as an organism ages non-pathologically. In this work we contribute to closing this gap, studying how physiological changes correlated with advanced age impact the computational performance of a spiking network model of primary visual cortex (V1). Our results demonstrate that deterioration of homeostatic regulation of excitatory firing, coupled with long-term synaptic plasticity, is a sufficient mechanism to reproduce features of observed physiological and functional changes in neural activity data, specifically declines in inhibition and in selectivity to oriented stimuli. This suggests a potential causality between dysregulation of neuron firing and age-induced changes in brain physiology and performance. While this does not rule out deeper underlying causes or other mechanisms that could give rise to these changes, our approach opens new avenues for exploring these underlying mechanisms in greater depth and making predictions for future experiments.",

We investigated the differential responses of three distinct Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, an industrial wine strain, ADY5, a laboratory strain, CEN.PK113-7D and an industrial bioethanol strain, Ethanol Red, grown at sub- and supra-optimal temperatures under chemostat conditions. We employed anaerobic conditions, mimicking the industrial processes. The proteomic profile of these strains was performed by SWATH-MS, allowing the quantification of 997 proteins, data available via ProteomeXchange (PXD016567). Our analysis demonstrated that temperature responses differ between the strains; however, we also found some common responsive proteins, revealing that the response to temperature involves general stress and specific mechanisms. Overall, sub-optimal temperature conditions involved a higher remodeling of the proteome. The proteomic data evidenced that the cold response involves strong repression of translation-related proteins as well as induction of amino acid metabolism, together with components related to protein folding and degradation while, the high temperature response mainly recruits amino acid metabolism. Our study provides a global and thorough insight into how growth temperature affects the yeast proteome, which can be a step forward in the comprehension and improvement of yeast thermotolerance.",

Machine-learning models combining both microbiota (mixed models) performed better than either dataset in patient stratification, with the highest area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.842. Sputum-microbiota contributed more than the gut in the mixed models; in addition, sputum-only models performed similarly to the mixed models in most cases. Several microbial-biomarkers were shared by both microbiota, indicating their similar roles at distinct body sites. Microbial-biomarkers of distinct disease stages were mostly shared, suggesting biomarkers for distant metastasis could be acquired early. Furthermore, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a species previously associated with wound infections, was significantly more abundant in brain metastasis, indicating distinct types of DMs could have different microbial-biomarkers.\n\nConclusionOur results indicate that alterations of sputum-microbiota have stronger relationships with NSCLC and distant metastasis than the gut, and strongly support the feasibility of metagenome-based non-invasive disease diagnosis and risk evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Despite the ubiquity and ecological importance of diatoms, much remains to be understood about their physiology and metabolism, including their carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. Early carotenoid biosynthesis steps are well-conserved, while the identity of the enzymes that catalyze the later steps and their order remain unclear. Those steps lead to the biosynthesis of the final pathway products: the main accessory light-harvesting pigment fucoxanthin (Fx) and the main photoprotective pigment pool comprised of diadinoxanthin (Ddx) and its reversibly de-epoxidized form diatoxanthin (Dtx). We used sequence comparison to known carotenoid biosynthesis enzymes to identify novel candidates in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. Microarray and RNA-seq data was used to select candidates with transcriptomic responses similar to known carotenoid biosynthesis genes and to create full-length gene models, and we focused on those that encode proteins predicted to be chloroplast-localized. We identified a violaxanthin de-epoxidase-like gene (Thaps3_11707, VDL2) that when overexpressed results in increased Fx abundance while stoichiometrically reducing Ddx+Dtx. Based on transcriptomics, we hypothesize that Thaps3_10233 may also contribute to Fx biosynthesis, in addition to VDL2. Separately using antisense RNA to target VDL2, VDL1, and both LUT1-like copies (hypothesized to catalyze an earlier step in the pathway) simultaneously, reduced the overall cellular photosynthetic pigment content, including chlorophylls, suggesting destabilization of light-harvesting complexes by Fx deficiency. Based on transcriptomic and physiological data, we hypothesize that the two predicted T. pseudonana zeaxanthin epoxidases have distinct functions and that different copies of phytoene synthase and phytoene desaturase may serve to initiate carotenoid biosynthesis in response to different cellular needs. Finally, nine carotene cis/trans isomerase (CRTISO) candidates identified based on sequence identity to known CRTISO proteins were narrowed to two most likely to be part of the T. pseudonana carotenoid biosynthesis pathway based on transcriptomic responses and predicted chloroplast targeting.",

    "abstract": "The profiling of gene expression by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) has enabled powerful studies of global transcriptional patterns in all organisms, including bacteria. Because the vast majority of RNA in bacteria is ribosomal RNA (rRNA), it is standard practice to deplete the rRNA from a total RNA sample such that the reads in an RNA-seq experiment derive predominantly from mRNA. One of the most commonly used commercial kits for rRNA depletion, the Ribo-Zero kit from Illumina, was recently discontinued. Here, we report the development a simple, cost-effective, and robust method for depleting rRNA that can be easily implemented by any lab or facility. We first developed an algorithm for designing biotinylated oligonucleotides that will hybridize tightly and specifically to the 23S, 16S, and 5S rRNAs from any species of interest. Precipitation of these oligonucleotides bound to rRNA by magnetic streptavidin beads then depletes rRNA from a complex, total RNA sample such that ~75-80% of reads in a typical RNA-seq experiment derive from mRNA. Importantly, we demonstrate a high correlation of RNA abundance or fold-change measurements in RNA-seq experiments between our method and the previously available Ribo-Zero kit. Complete details on the methodology are provided, including open-source software for designing oligonucleotides optimized for any bacterial species or metagenomic sample of interest.\n\nImportanceThe ability to examine global patterns of gene expression in microbes through RNA-sequencing has fundamentally transformed microbiology. However, RNA-seq depends critically on the removal of ribosomal RNA from total RNA samples. Otherwise, rRNA would comprise upwards of 90% of the reads in a typical RNA-seq experiment, limiting the reads coming from messenger RNA or requiring high total read depth. A commonly used, kit for rRNA subtraction from Illumina was recently discontinued. Here, we report the development of a  do-it-yourself kit for rapid, cost-effective, and robust depletion of rRNA from total RNA. We present an algorithm for designing biotinylated oligonucleotides that will hybridize to the rRNAs from a target set of species. We then demonstrate that the designed oligos enable sufficient rRNA depletion to produce RNA-seq data with 75-80% of reads comming from mRNA. The methodology presented should enable RNA-seq studies on any species or metagenomic sample of interest.",

    "abstract": "The centrosome is the main organizer of microtubules and as such, its position is a key determinant of polarized cell functions. As the name says, the default position of the centrosome is considered to be the cell geometrical center. However, the mechanism regulating centrosome positioning is still unclear and often confused with the mechanism regulating the position of the nucleus to which it is linked. Here we used enucleated cells plated on adhesive micropatterns to impose regular and precise geometrical conditions to centrosome-microtubule networks. Although frequently observed there, the equilibrium position of the centrosome is not systematically at the cell geometrical center and can be close to cell edge. Centrosome positioning appears to respond accurately to the architecture and anisotropy of the actin network, which constitutes, rather than cell shape, the actual spatial boundary conditions the microtubule network is sensitive to. We found that the contraction of the actin network defines a peripheral margin, in which microtubules appeared bent by compressive forces. The disassembly of the actin network away from the cell edges defines an inner zone where actin bundles were absent and microtubules were more radially organized. The production of dynein-based forces on microtubules places the centrosome at the center of this inner zone. Cell adhesion pattern and contractile forces define the shape and position of the inner zone in which the centrosome-microtubule network is centered.",

    "abstract": "Despite the consensus that warming will affect biodiversity, alter physicochemical environments, and disrupt biological interactions, the relative importance of these key processes and how they interact to determine overall ecosystem function is poorly understood. Here, we analyze long-term (16[~]39 years) time series data from ten aquatic ecosystems and use convergent cross mapping (CCM) to quantify the hidden causal network linking species diversity, ecosystem function, and physicochemical factors. We observe that aquatic ecosystems subject to stronger warming exhibit decreased stability (larger fluctuations in phytoplankton biomass). We further show that this effect can be attributed to a weakening of stabilizing causal pathways between biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and phytoplankton biomass. Thus, rather than thinking in terms of separate factors, a more holistic view, that causally links biodiversity and the other ecosystem components, is required to understand and predict climate impacts on the temporal stability of aquatic ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen responsible for a wide range of chronic infections. Disease chronicity is often associated with biofilm formation, a phenotype that confers enhanced tolerance towards antimicrobials, a trait which can be attributed to a dormant, non-dividing subpopulation within the biofilm. Development of antibiofilm agents that target these populations could therefore improve treatment success. HT61 is a quinoline derivative that has demonstrated efficacy towards non-dividing planktonic Staphylococcus spp. and therefore, in principal, could be effective against staphylococcal biofilms. In this study HT61 was tested on mature S. aureus biofilms, assessing both antimicrobial efficacy and characterising the cellular response to treatment. HT61 was found to be more effective than vancomycin in killing S. aureus biofilms (minimum bactericidal concentrations: HT61; 32 mg/L, vancomycin; 64 mg/L), and in reducing biofilm biomass. Scanning electron microscopy of HT61-treated biofilms also revealed disrupted cellular structure and biofilm architecture. HT61 treatment resulted in increased expression of proteins associated with the cell wall stress stimulon and dcw cluster, implying global changes in peptidoglycan and cell wall biosynthesis. Altered expression of metabolic and translational proteins following treatment also confirm a general adaptive response. These findings suggest that HT61 represents a new treatment for S. aureus biofilm-associated infections that are otherwise tolerant to conventional antibiotics targeting actively dividing cells.",

Targeting post-translational modification (PTM) pathways provides a mechanism by which viruses can broadly and rapidly transform a hostile host environment into a hospitable one. We used quantitative proteomics to measure changes in two PTM types - phosphorylation and ubiquitination - in response to HIV-1 infection with viruses harboring targeted deletions of a subset of HIV-1 genes. PTM analysis revealed a requirement for Aurora kinase A activity in HIV-1 infection and furthermore revealed that AMP-activated kinase activity is modulated during infection via HIV-1 Vif-mediated degradation of B56-containing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Finally, we demonstrated that the Cullin4A-DDB1-DCAF1 E3 ubiquitin ligase ubiquitinates histone H1 somatic isoforms and that HIV-1 Vpr inhibits this process, leading to defects in DNA repair. Thus, global PTM profiling of infected cells serves as an effective tool for uncovering specific mechanisms of host pathway modulation.",

    "abstract": "S. agnetis has been previously associated with subclinical or clinically mild cases of mastitis in dairy cattle and is one of several Staphylococcal species that have been isolated from the bone and blood of lame broilers. We were the first to report that S. agnetis could be obtained frequently from bacterial chondronecrosis with osteomyelitis (BCO) lesions of lame broilers. Further, we showed that a particular isolate of S. agnetis, chicken isolate 908, can induce lameness in over 50% of exposed chickens, far exceeding normal BCO incidences in broiler operations. We have previously reported the assembly and annotation of the genome of isolate 908. To better understand the relationship between dairy cattle and broiler isolates, we assembled 11 additional genomes for S. agnetis isolates, including an additional chicken BCO strain, and ten isolates from milk, mammary gland secretions or udder skin, from the collection at the University of Missouri. To trace phylogenetic relationships, we constructed phylogenetic trees based on multi-locus sequence typing, and Genome-to-Genome Distance Comparisons. Chicken isolate 908 clustered with two of the cattle isolates along with three isolates from chickens in Denmark and an isolate of S. agnetis we isolated from a BCO lesion on a commercial broiler farm in Arkansas. We used a number of BLAST tools to compare the chicken isolates to those from cattle and identified 98 coding sequences distinguishing isolate 908 from the cattle isolates. None of the identified genes explain the differences in host or tissue tropism. These analyses are critical to understanding how Staphylococci colonize and infect different hosts and potentially how they can transition to alternative niches (bone vs dermis).\n\nImportanceStaphylococcus agnetis has been recently recognized as associated with disease in dairy cattle and meat type chickens. The infections appear to be limited in cattle and systemic in broilers. This report details the molecular relationships between cattle and chicken isolates in order to understand how this recently recognized species infects different hosts with different disease manifestations. The data show the chicken and cattle isolates are very closely related but the chicken isolates all cluster together suggesting a single jump from cattle to chickens.",

    "abstract": "A method for simultaneous electrochemical detection of brain tissue PO2 (PtO2) and pH changes together with neuronal activity using a modified form of fast cyclic voltammetry with carbon fiber electrodes is described. This technique has been developed for in vivo applications and recordings from discrete brain nuclei in experimental animals. The small size of the carbon fiber electrode (7m, length <100m) ensures minimal disruption of the brain tissue and allows recordings from small brain areas. Sample rate (up to 4 Hz) is sufficient to resolve rapid changes in PtO2 and pH that follow changes in neuronal activity and metabolism. Rapid switching between current and voltage recordings allows combined electrochemical detection and monitoring of extracellular action potentials. For simultaneous electrochemical detection of PtO2 and pH, two consecutive trapezoidal voltage ramps are applied with double differential-subtraction of the background current. This enables changes in current caused by protons and oxygen to be detected separately with minimal interference between the two. The profile of PtO2 changes evoked by increases in local neuronal activity recorded using the described technique was similar to that of blood oxygen level dependent responses recorded using fMRI. This voltammetric technique can be combined with fMRI and brain vessel imaging to study the metabolic mechanisms underlying neurovascular coupling response with much greater spatial and temporal resolution than is currently possible.",

    "abstract": "Decoding is a powerful approach for measuring the information contained in the activity of neural populations. As a result, decoding analyses are now used across a wide range of model organisms and experimental paradigms. However, typical analyses employ general purpose decoding algorithms that do not explicitly take advantage of the structure of neural variability, which is often low-dimensional and can thus be effectively characterized using latent variables. Here we propose a new decoding framework that exploits the low-dimensional structure of neural population variability by removing correlated variability that is unrelated to the decoded variable, then decoding the resulting denoised activity. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework using simulated data, where the true upper bounds for decoding performance are known. A linear version of our decoder provides an estimator for the decoded variable that can be more efficient than other commonly used linear estimators such as linear discriminant analysis. In addition, our proposed decoding framework admits a simple extension to nonlinear decoding that compares favorably to standard feed-forward neural networks. By explicitly modeling shared population variability, the success of the resulting linear and nonlinear decoders also offers a new perspective on the relationship between shared variability and information contained in large neural populations.",

    "abstract": "Individuals are able to discriminate visual stimuli they report not consciously seeing. This phenomenon is known as \"subliminal perception.\" Such capacity is often assumed to be relatively automatic in nature, and rely on stimulus-driven activity in low-level cortical areas. Instead, here we asked to what extent neural activity before stimulus presentation influences subliminal perception. We asked participants to discriminate the location of a briefly presented low-contrast visual stimulus, and then rate how well they saw the stimulus. Consistent with previous studies, participants correctly discriminated with slightly above chance-level accuracy the location of a stimulus they reported not seeing. Signal detection analyses indicated that while subjects categorized their percepts as \"unconscious\", their capacity to discriminate these stimuli lay on the same continuum as conscious vision. We show that the accuracy of discriminating the location of a subliminal stimulus could be predicted with relatively high accuracy (AUC = .70) based on lateralized electroencephalographic (EEG) activity before the stimulus, the hemifield where the stimulus was presented, and accuracy of previous trials discrimination response. Altogether, our results suggest that rather than being a separate unconscious capacity, subliminal perception is based on similar processes as conscious vison.",

    "abstract": "Drought stress especially at the reproductive stage is a major limiting factor that compromises the productivity and profitability of canola in many regions of the world. Improved genetics for drought tolerance would enable the identification and development of resilient varieties, resulting in increased canola production. The main objective of this study was to dissect the genetic basis of seed yield under water-limited conditions in canola. A doubled haploid population derived from a cross between two Australian parental lines, RP04 and Ag-Outback, was evaluated to identify the genetic variation in fractional normalised deviation vegetative index (NDVI), above ground shoot biomass accumulation, flowering time, and plasticity in seed yield under irrigated and rainfed field conditions in two consecutive years. An irrigation treatment was applied at the 50% flowering stage and an incremental drought tolerance index (DTI) was estimated for seed yield. By utilising a genetic linkage map based on 18,851 genome-wide DArTseq markers, we identified 25 genomic regions significantly associated with different traits (LOD [&ge;] 3), accounting for 5.5 to 22.3% of the genotypic variance. Three significant genomic regions on chromosome A06, A10 and C04 were associated with DTI for seed yield. Some of the QTL were localised in the close proximity of candidates genes involved in traits contributing to drought escape and drought avoidance mechanisms, including FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Trait-marker associations identified herein can be validated across diverse environments, and the sequence based markers may be used in a marker assisted selection breeding strategy to enhance drought tolerance in canola breeding germplasm.",

GmSALT3 confers net shoot exclusion for both Na+ and Cl- and improves salt tolerance of soybean; however, how the ER-localised GmSALT3 achieves this is unknown. Here, GmSALT3s function was investigated in heterologous systems and near-isogenic lines that contained the full-length GmSALT3 (NIL-T; salt-tolerant) or a truncated transcript Gmsalt3 (NIL-S; salt-sensitive). GmSALT3 restored growth of K+-uptake-defective E. coli and contributed toward net influx and accumulation of Na+, K+, and Cl- in Xenopus laevis oocytes, while Gmsalt3 was non-functional. A time-course analysis of the NILs confirmed that shoot Cl- exclusion breaks down prior to Na+ exclusion, while grafting showed that shoot Na+ exclusion occurs via a root xylem-based mechanism. In contrast, NIL-T plants exhibited significantly greater Cl- content in both the stem xylem and phloem sap compared to NIL-S, indicating that shoot Cl- exclusion likely depends upon novel phloem-based Cl- recirculation. NIL-T shoots grafted on NIL-S roots contained low shoot Cl-, which confirmed that Cl- recirculation is dependent on the presence of GmSALT3 in shoots. Overall, these findings provide new insights on GmSALT3s impact on salinity tolerance and reveal a novel mechanism for shoot Cl- exclusion in plants.\n\nHighlightGmSALT3 improves soybean salt tolerance.

    "abstract": "Living organisms use a large panel of mechanisms to protect themselves from environmental stress. Particularly, heat stress induces misfolding and aggregation of proteins which are guarded by chaperone systems. Here, we examine the function the glutaredoxin GRXS17, a member of thiol reductases families in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. GRXS17 is a nucleocytosolic monothiol glutaredoxin consisting of an N-terminal thioredoxin (TRX)-domain and three CGFS-active site motif-containing GRX-domains that coordinate three iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in a glutathione (GSH)-dependent manner. As a Fe-S cluster-charged holoenzyme, GRXS17 is likely involved in the maturation of cytosolic and nuclear Fe-S proteins. In addition to its role in cluster biogenesis, we showed that GRXS17 presents both foldase and redox-dependent holdase activities. Oxidative stress in combination with heat stress induces loss of its Fe-S clusters followed by subsequent formation of disulfide bonds between conserved active site cysteines in the corresponding TRX domains. This oxidation leads to a shift of GRXS17 to a high-MW complex and thus, activates its holdase activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that GRXS17 is specifically involved in plant tolerance to moderate high temperature and protects root meristematic cells from heat-induced cell death. Finally, we showed that upon heat stress, GRXS17 changes its client proteins, possibly to protect them from heat injuries. Therefore, we propose that the iron-sulfur cluster enzyme glutaredoxin GRXS17 is an essential guard to protect proteins against moderate heat stress, likely through a redox-dependent chaperone activity. All in all, we reveal the mechanism of an Fe-S cluster-dependent activity shift, turning the holoenzyme GRXS17 into a holdase that prevents damage caused by heat stress.",

    "abstract": "Cell shapes are known to regulate cytoskeletal organization, stiffness and the ability of cells to migrate and proliferate. Yet a quantitative understanding of the fundamental biochemical and biophysical mechanisms that determine the cell shapes is currently not available. In this study, we developed a chemo-mechanical feedback model to predict how adhesions and the properties of the 3D microenvironment regulate cell shapes. We find that the cells in 3D collagen matrices remain round or adopt an elongated shape depending on the density of active integrins, the level of contractility regulated by mechanosensitive signaling pathways and the density and mechanics of the matrix. While the formation of actin fibers that run along the cell body mediated by integrins and matrix stiffness drive elongation of cells, the cortical and membrane tension resist elongation. Based on the competition between these mechanisms, we derive phase diagrams for cell shape in the space spanned by the density of active adhesions and the level of biochemical signaling that controls contractility. Our predictions are validated by studying the shapes of HT1080 cells cultured in collagen gels of varying densities and using pharmacological treatments to regulate adhesions and contractility. The predictions of the model are found to be in excellent agreement with our experiments and data reported on a number of cell types in the literature.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a catabolic process whereby cytoplasmic components are degraded within lysosomes, allowing cells to maintain energy homeostasis during nutrient depletion. Several studies have shown that the CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 promotes starvation-induced autophagy. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report that in amino acid deprived cells, p27 controls autophagy via an mTORC1-dependent mechanism. During prolonged amino acid starvation, a fraction of p27 is recruited to lysosomes where it interacts with LAMTOR1, a component of the Ragulator complex required for mTORC1 lysosomal localization and activation. p27 binding to LAMTOR1 prevents Ragulator assembly and function and subsequent mTORC1 activation, thereby promoting autophagy. Conversely, upon amino acid withdrawal, p27-/- cells exhibit elevated mTORC1 signaling, impaired lysosomal activity and autophagy, and resistance to apoptosis. This is associated with sequestration of TFEB in the cytoplasm, preventing the induction of lysosomal genes required for lysosomal function. Silencing of LAMTOR1 or mTOR inhibition restores autophagy and induces apoptosis in p27-/- cells. Together, these results reveal a direct, coordinated regulation between the cell cycle and cell growth machineries.",

Effective approaches are therefore required to map the massive space of unexplored compound-target interactions for novel and potent activities. Here, we carried out a crowdsourced benchmarking of predictive models for kinase inhibitor potencies across multiple kinase families using unpublished bioactivity data. The top-performing predictions were based on kernel learning, gradient boosting and deep learning, and their ensemble resulted in predictive accuracy exceeding that of kinase activity assays. We then made new experiments based on the model predictions, which further improved the accuracy of experimental mapping efforts and identified unexpected potencies even for under-studied kinases. The open-source algorithms together with the novel bioactivities between 95 compounds and 295 kinases provide a resource for benchmarking new prediction algorithms and for extending the druggable kinome.",

While there are theoretical and computational frameworks for prediction, the circuit and receptor-level mechanisms are unclear. Using high-density EEG, Bayesian modeling and machine learning, we show that inferred \"causal\" relationships between stimuli and frontal alpha activity account for reaction times (a proxy for predictions) on a trial-by-trial basis in an audio-visual delayed match-to-sample task which elicited predictions. Predictive beta feedback activated sensory representations in advance of predicted stimuli. Low-dose ketamine, a NMDA receptor blocker - but not the control drug dexmedetomidine - perturbed behavioral indices of predictions, their representation in higher-order cortex, feedback to posterior cortex and pre-activation of sensory templates in higher-order sensory cortex. This study suggests predictions depend on alpha activity in higher-order cortex, beta feedback and NMDA receptors, and ketamine blocks access to learned predictive information.",

    "abstract": "The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) drives circadian rhythms in locomotion through coupled, single-cell oscillations. Global genetic deletion of the neuropeptide, Vip or its receptor Vipr2, results in profound deficits in daily synchrony among SCN cells and daily rhythms in locomotor behavior and glucocorticoid secretion. To test whether this phenotype depends on VIP neurons in the SCN, we ablated VIP SCN neurons in vivo in adult mice through Caspase3-mediated induction of the apoptotic pathway in cre-expressing VIP neurons. We found that ablation of VIP SCN neurons in adult mice caused a phenotype distinct from Vip- and Vipr2- null mice. Mice lacking VIP neurons retained rhythmic locomotor activity with a shortened circadian period, more variable onsets and decreased duration of daily activity. Circadian hormonal outputs, specifically corticosterone rhythms were severely dampened. In contrast, deletion of neonatal SCN VIP neurons dramatically reduced circadian gene expression in the cultured SCN, mimicking the effects of global deletion of Vip or Vipr2. These results suggest that SCN VIP neurons play a role in lengthening circadian period and stimulating the daily surge in glucocorticoids in adults and in synchronizing and sustaining daily rhythms among cells in the developing SCN.\n\nSignificance StatementThe importance of the neuropeptide, VIP, for circadian rhythms has been described in mice lacking the gene for Vip or its receptor, Vipr2. This study found that ablation of VIP neurons only in the adult SCN reproduced the loss of circadian rhythms in glucocorticoids, but not the loss of circadian locomotor behavior, seen with global loss of VIP signaling. We conclude that VIP SCN neurons play two roles: one in adulthood lengthening circadian period and regulating circadian outputs, and one in development coordinating synchrony among circadian cells.",

Knockout of Lrp5 in rats produced low bone mass, decreased bone mineral density, and decreased bone size. The superficial retinal vasculature of Lrp5-deficient rats was sparse and disorganized, with extensive exudates and decreases in vascularized area, vessel length, and branch point density. This study showed that Lrp5 could be predictably knocked out in rats using CRISPR/Cas9, causing the expression of bone and retinal phenotypes that will be useful for studying the role of Wnt signaling in bone and retina development and for research on the treatment of osteoporosis and FEVR.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated development of muscles, tendons, and their attachment sites ensures emergence of functional musculoskeletal units that are adapted to diverse anatomical demands among different species. How these different tissues are patterned and functionally assembled during embryogenesis is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the morphogenesis of extraocular muscles (EOMs), an evolutionary conserved cranial muscle group that is crucial for the coordinated movement of the eyeballs and for visual acuity. By means of lineage analysis, we redefined the cellular origins of periocular connective tissues interacting with the EOMs, which do not arise exclusively from neural crest mesenchyme as previously thought. Using 3D imaging approaches, we established an integrative blueprint for the EOM functional unit. By doing so, we identified a developmental time window where individual EOMs emerge from a unique muscle anlage and establish insertions in the sclera, which sets these muscles apart from classical muscle-to-bone type of insertions. Further, we demonstrate that the eyeballs are a source of diffusible retinoic acid that allow their targeting by the EOMs in a temporal and dose dependent manner. Using genetically modified mice and inhibitor treatments, we find that endogenous local variations in the concentration of retinoids contribute to the establishment of tendon condensations and attachment sites that precede the initiation of muscle patterning. Collectively, our results highlight how global and site-specific programs are deployed for the assembly of muscle functional units with precise definition of muscle shapes and topographical wiring of their tendon attachments.",

    "abstract": "Social environments influence multiple traits of individuals including immunity, stress and ageing, often in sex-specific ways. The composition of the microbiome (the assemblage of symbiotic microorganisms within a host) is determined by environmental factors and the hosts immune, endocrine and neural systems. The social environment could alter host microbiomes extrinsically by affecting transmission between individuals, likely promoting homogeneity in the microbiome of social partners. Alternatively, intrinsic effects arising from interactions between the microbiome and host physiology (the microbiota-gut-brain axis) could translate social stress into dysbiotic microbiomes, with consequences for host health. We investigated how manipulating social environments during larval and adult life-stages altered the microbiome composition of Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies. We used social contexts that particularly alter the development and lifespan of males, predicting that any intrinsic social effects on the microbiome would therefore be sex-specific. The presence of adult males during the larval stage significantly altered the microbiome of pupae of both sexes. In adults, same-sex grouping increased bacterial diversity in both sexes. Importantly, the microbiome community structure of males was more sensitive to social contact at older ages, an effect partially mitigated by housing focal males with young rather than co-aged groups. Functional analyses suggest that these microbiome changes impact ageing and immune responses. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the substantial effects of the social environment on individual health are mediated through intrinsic effects on the microbiome, and provides a model for understanding the mechanistic basis of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.\n\nSignificance statementThe social environment has pervasive, multifaceted effects on individual health and fitness. If a hosts microbiome is sensitive to the social environment then it could be an important mediator of social effects, as the reciprocal relationships between hosts and their microbiomes have substantial implications for host health. Using a Drosophila melanogaster fruit fly model we show that the fly microbiome is sensitive to the social environment in a sex, age and life-stage dependent manner. In particular, older adult male microbiome communities are altered by same-sex social contact, but this depends on the age of the social partners. These changes have functional effects on fly immunity and lifespan, evidence that indeed this is an influential mediator of social effects on health.",

Drug-associated environmental stimuli can trigger alcohol relapse and promote alcohol consumption whereby N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play a pivotal role. Here we sought to demonstrate, for the first time, that ethanol induces conditioned place preference or aversion (CPP or CPA) when administered locally into the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and the associated role of MORs. We further analyzed the changes in the expression and mRNA levels of GluN1 and GluN2A subunits in designated brain areas. The expression of CPP or CPA was characterized following intra-VTA ethanol administration and we showed that either reinforcing (CPP) or aversive (CPA) properties are dependent on the dose administered (ranging here from 35 to 300 nmol). Furthermore, the critical contribution of local MORs in the acquisition of CPP was revealed by a selective antagonist, namely {beta}-Funaltrexamine. Finally, modifications of the expression of NMDA receptor subunits in the Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) and Hippocampus after ethanol-induced CPP were analyzed at the proteomic and transcriptomic levels by western blot and In Situ Hybridation RNAscope techniques, respectively. Results showed that the mRNA levels of GluN2A but not GluN1 in NAc are higher after ethanol CPP. These novel results pave the way for further characterisation of the mechanisms by which ethanol motivational properties are associated with learned environmental cues.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThrombosis is a potentially life-threatening nephrotic syndrome (NS) complication. We have previously demonstrated that hypercoagulopathy is proportional to NS severity in rat models and that pioglitazone (Pio) reduces proteinuria both independently and in combination with methylprednisolone (MP), a glucocorticoid (GC). However, the effect of these treatments on NS-associated hypercoagulopathy remains unknown. We thus sought to determine the ability of Pio and GC to alleviate NS-associated hypercoagulopathy.\n\nMethodsPuromycin aminonucleoside-induced rat NS was treated with sham, Low- or High-dose MP, Pio, or combination (Pio+Low-MP) and plasma was collected at day 11. Plasma samples were collected from children with steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) and steroid-resistant NS (SRNS) upon presentation and after 7 weeks of GC therapy. Plasma endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), antithrombin (AT) activity, and albumin (Alb) were measured using thrombin generation, amidolytic, and colorimetric assays, respectively.\n\nResultsIn a rat model of NS, both High-MP and Pio improved proteinuria and corrected hypoalbuminemia, ETP and AT activity (P<0.05). Proteinuria (P=0.005) and hypoalbuminemia (P<0.001) were correlated with ETP. In childhood NS, while ETP was not different at presentation, GC therapy improved proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and ETP in children with SSNS (P<0.001) but not SRNS (P=0.330).\n\nConclusionsBoth Pio and GC diminish proteinuria and significantly alleviate hypercoagulopathy. Both Pio and MP improved hypercoagulopathy in rats, and successful GC therapy (SSNS) also improved hypercoagulopathy in childhood NS. These data suggest that even a partial reduction in proteinuria may reduce NS-associated thrombotic risk.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by massive proteinuria and is complicated by a complex, acquired hypercoagulopathy that markedly increases the risk for potentially life-threatening venous thromboembolism (VTE). This study demonstrates a strong correlation between proteinuria reduction and improvement of an established VTE-risk biomarker, in both a well-established animal model and in childhood NS before and after steroid treatment. We show that nuclear receptor agonists with known disparate mechanisms of action successfully reduce proteinuria and simultaneously improve NS-associated hypercoagulopathy. These data suggest that complete or partial proteinuria reduction by any therapeutic modality may concurrently reduce NS-associated thrombotic risk.",

    "abstract": "In adult rodents, a principal neuron in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid (MNTB) is generally contacted by a single, giant axosomatic terminal called the calyx of Held. How this one-on-one relation is established is still unknown, but anatomical evidence suggests that during development principal neurons are innervated by multiple calyces, which may indicate calyceal competition. However, in vivo electrophysiological recordings from principal neurons indicated that only a single strong synaptic connection forms per cell. To test whether a mismatch exists between synaptic strength and terminal size, we compared the strength of synaptic inputs with the morphology of the synaptic terminals. In vivo whole-cell recordings of the MNTB neurons from newborn Wistar rats of either sex were made while stimulating their afferent axons, allowing us to identify multiple inputs. The strength of the strongest input increased to calyceal levels in a few days across cells, while the strength of the second strongest input was stable. The recorded cells were subsequently immunolabeled for vesicular glutamate transporters (VGluT) to reveal axosomatic terminals with structured-illumination microscopy. Synaptic strength of the strongest input was correlated with the contact area of the largest VGluT cluster at the soma (r = 0.8), and no indication of a mismatch between structure and strength was observed. Together, our data agree with a developmental scheme in which one input strengthens and becomes the calyx of Held, but not with multi-calyceal competition.\n\nKey points summaryO_LIDuring development the giant, auditory calyx of Held forms a one-to-one connection with a principal neuron of the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body.\nC_LIO_LIWhile anatomical studies described that most of the target cells are temporarily contacted by multiple calyces, multi-calyceal innervation was only sporadically observed in in vivo recordings, suggesting a structure-function discrepancy.\nC_LIO_LIWe correlated synaptic strength of inputs, identified in in vivo recordings, with post hoc labeling of the recorded neuron and synaptic terminals containing vesicular glutamate transporters (VGluT).\nC_LIO_LIDuring development only one input increased to the level of the calyx of Held synapse, and its strength correlated with the large VGluT cluster contacting the postsynaptic soma.\nC_LIO_LIAs neither competing strong inputs nor multiple large VGluT clusters on a single cell were observed, our findings did not indicate a structure-function discrepancy.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Multimodal integration provides an ideal framework for investigating top-down influences in perceptual integration. Here, we investigate mechanisms and functional networks participating in face-voice multimodal integration during gender perception by using complementary behavioral (Maximum Likelihood Conjoint Measurement) and brain imaging (Dynamic Causal Modeling of fMRI data) techniques. Thirty-six subjects were instructed to judge pairs of face-voice stimuli either according to the gender of the face (face task), the voice (voice task) or the stimulus (stimulus task; no specific modality instruction given). Face and voice contributions to the tasks were not independent, as both modalities significantly contributed to all tasks. The top-down influences in each task could be modeled as a differential weighting of the contributions of each modality with an asymmetry in favor of the auditory modality in terms of magnitude of the effect. Additionally, we observed two independent interaction effects in the decision process that reflect both the coherence of the gender information across modalities and the magnitude of the gender difference from neutral. In a second experiment we investigated with functional MRI the modulation of effective connectivity between the Fusiform Face Area (FFA) and the Temporal Voice Area (TVA), two cortical areas implicated in face and voice processing. Twelve participants were presented with multimodal face-voice stimuli and instructed to attend either to face, voice or any gender information. We found specific changes in effective connectivity between these areas in the same conditions that generated behavioral interactions. Taken together, we interpret these results as converging evidence supporting the existence of multiple parallel hierarchical systems in multi-modal integration.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWVery little is known about the role of effective cognitive therapy in reversing imbalances in brain activity after trauma. We hypothesised that exaggerated threat perception characteristic of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and subsequent recovery from this disorder, are underpinned by changes in the dynamics of large-scale brain networks. Here, we use a novel data-driven approach with high temporal precision to find recurring brain networks from fMRI data and estimate when these networks become active during exposure to either trauma reminders or neutral pictures. We found that PTSD patients spend less time in two default mode sub-networks in contrast to trauma-exposed healthy controls, and that PTSD symptom severity correlates positively with time spent in the salience network during exposure to trauma reminders. The former are important for different aspects of self-referential processing and the latter for detection of threat. Importantly, the decreased time in the default mode sub-networks is rebalanced after successful cognitive therapy for PTSD. Our results show that remittance of PTSD through trauma-focused cognitive therapy is associated with the successful reinstatement of a healthy balance in self-referential and threat detection brain networks.",

    "abstract": "Resource insecurity (e.g., poverty) can be a significant source of stress. Decreased resources during childhood has been associated with increased risk for developing stress-related disorders, including major depressive disorder and anxiety Although the link between early life adversity and increased risk for psychopathology has been well established, the developmental mechanisms remain unclear. Using a mouse model of poverty-like rearing, limited bedding and nesting materials (LB), we tested the effects of LB on the development of fear learning and of key neuronal structures involved in emotional regulation, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). LB delayed the ability of pre-adolescent mice to express, but not form, an auditory conditioned fear memory. LB disrupted typical fear circuit development, accelerating parvalbumin positive (PV+) inhibitory interneuron maturation in the BLA and delaying the maturation of connections between the mPFC and BLA. The decreased fear expression in LB reared mice during early development was rescued through optogenetic inactivation of PV+ cells in the BLA. Together our data demonstrate that LB has profound and deleterious effects on mPFC and BLA development, decreasing threat-associated behavior expression, but not learning, in childhood. The current results provide a model of transiently blunt emotional reactivity in childhood, with fear-associated memories emerging later in adolescence, and possibly contributing to later pathology development.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the behavior of extinct species is challenging, particularly for those with no living analogues. However, damage preserved as paleopathologies on bone can record how an animal moved in life, potentially reflecting behavioral patterns. Here, we assess hypothesized etiologies of pathology in a pelvis and associated right femur of a Smilodon fatalis saber-toothed cat, one of the best-studied species from the Pleistocene-age Rancho La Brea asphalt seeps, California, USA, using visualization by computed tomography (CT). The pelvis exhibits massive destruction of the right hip socket that was interpreted, for nearly a century, to have developed from trauma and infection. CT imaging reveals instead that the pathological distortions characterize chronic remodeling that began at birth and led to degeneration of the joint over the animals life. These results suggest that this individual suffered from hip dysplasia, a congenital condition common in domestic dogs and cats. This individual reached adulthood but could not have hunted properly nor defended territory on its own, likely relying on a social group for feeding and protection. While extant social felids are rare, these fossils and others with similar pathologies are consistent with a spectrum of social strategies in Smilodon supported by a predominance of previous studies.",

    "abstract": "A panel of 60 genotypes consisting of New Plant Types (NPTs) along with indica, tropical and temperate japonica genotypes were phenotypically evaluated for four seasons in irrigated situation for grain yield per se and component traits. Twenty NPT genotypes were found to be promising with an average grain yield of 5.45 to 8.8 t/ha. A total of 85 SSR markers were used in the study to identify QTLs associated with grain yield per se and related traits. Sixty-six (77.65%) markers were found to be polymorphic. The PIC values varied from 0.516 to 0.92 with an average of 0.704. A moderate level of genetic diversity (0.39) was detected among genotypes. Variation to the tune of 8% within genotypes, 68% among the genotypes within the population and 24% among the populations were observed (AMOVA). The association analysis using GLM and MLM models led to the identification of 30 and 10 SSR markers were associated with 70 and 16 QTLs, respectively. Thirty novel QTLs linked with 16 SSRs were identified to be associated with eleven traits, namely, tiller number (qTL-6.1, qTL-11.1, qTL-4.1), panicle length (qPL-1.1, qPL-5.1, qPL-7.1, qPL-8.1), flag leaf length (qFLL-8.1, qFLL-9.1), flag leaf width (qFLW-6.2, qFLW-5.1, qFLW-8.1, qFLW-7.1), total no. of grains (qTG-2.2, qTG-a7.1), thousand-grain weight (qTGW-a1.1, qTGW-a9.2, qTGW-5.1, qTGW-8.1), fertile grains (qFG-7.1), seed length-breadth ratio (qSlb-3.1), plant height (qPHT-6.1, qPHT-9.1), days to 50% flowering (qFD-1.1) and grain yield per se (qYLD-5.1, qYLD-6.1a, qYLD-11.1). This information could be useful for identification of highly potential parents for development of transgressive segregants. Moreover, super rice genotypes could be developed through pyramiding of these QTLS for important yield traits for prospective increment in yield potentiality and breaking yield ceiling.",

Now, it is understood that the rapid rate of topoI degradation in response to irinotecan causes irinotecan resistance. We have published that the deregulated DNA-PKcs kinase cascade ensures rapid degradation of topoI and is at the core of the drug resistance mechanism of topoI inhibitors, including irinotecan. We also identified CTD small phosphatase 1 (CTDSP1) (a nuclear phosphatase) as a primary upstream regulator of DNA-PKcs in response to topoI inhibitors. Previous reports showed that rabeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) inhibits CTDSP1 activity. The purpose of this study was to confirm the effects of rabeprazole on CTDSP1 activity and its impact on colon cancer. Using HCT116 and HT29, with high and low CTDSP1 expression respectively and a retrospective analysis of patients receiving irinotecan with or without rabeprazole have indicated the effect of CTDSP1 in irinotecan response. These results indicate that CTDSP1 promotes sensitivity to irinotecan and rabeprazole prevents this effect, resulting in drug resistance. To ensure the best chance at effective treatment, rabeprazole may not be a suitable PPI for cancer patients treated with irinotecan.",
