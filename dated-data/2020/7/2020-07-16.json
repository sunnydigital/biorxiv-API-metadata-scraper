    "abstract": "Advanced analytical strategies including top-down and middle-up HPLC-MS approaches have become powerful alternatives to classical bottom-up analysis for the characterization of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies. Here, we assess feasibility of middle-up analysis of polyclonal IgGs posing additional challenges due to extensive sequence variability. The presented workflow is based on Fc/2 portions as conserved subunits of IgGs and enables global profiling of subclasses and their glycosylation patterns, both of which influence IgG effector functions. To obtain subunits of murine IgGs, we established digestion with the bacterial protease SpeB. The resulting Fc/2 portions characteristic of different subclasses were subsequently analysed by ion-pair reversed-phase HPLC hyphenated to high-resolution mass spectrometry allowing relative quantification of IgG subclasses and their N-glycosylation variants. In order to assess method capabilities in an immunological context, we applied the analytical workflow to polyclonal antibodies obtained from BALB/c mice immunized with the grass pollen allergen Phl p 6. This analysis simultaneously revealed a shift in IgG subclasses and Fc-glycosylation patterns in total and antigen-specific IgGs from different mouse cohorts. Eventually, Fc/2 characterization may reveal other protein modifications including oxidation, amino acid exchanges, and C-terminal lysine as demonstrated for monoclonal IgGs, which may be implemented for quality control of functional antibodies.",

    "abstract": "The use of insect sex pheromones is an alternative technology for pest control in agriculture and forestry, which, in contrast to insecticides, does not have adverse effects on human health or environment and is efficient also against insecticide-resistant insect populations.1,2 Due to the high cost of chemically synthesized pheromones, mating disruption applications are currently primarily targeting higher value crops, such as fruits.3 Here we demonstrate a biotechnological method for the production of pheromones of economically important moth pests using engineered yeast cell factories. Biosynthetic pathways towards several pheromones or their precursors were reconstructed in the oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica, which was further metabolically engineered for improved pheromone biosynthesis by decreasing fatty alcohol degradation and downregulating storage lipid accumulation. The sex pheromone of the cotton bollworm Helicoverpa armigera was produced by oxidation of fermented fatty alcohols into corresponding aldehydes. The resulting pheromone was just as efficient and specific for trapping of H. armigera male moths in cotton fields in Greece as a synthetic pheromone mixture. We further demonstrated the production of the main pheromone component of the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda. Our work describes a biotech platform for the production of commercially relevant titres of moth pheromones for pest control by yeast fermentation.\n\nSignificance statementAgriculture largely relies on insecticides and genetically modified crops for pest control, however alternative solutions are required due to emerging resistance, toxicity and regulatory issues, and consumer preferences. Mating disruption with sex pheromones that act by preventing insect reproduction is considered the most promising and scalable alternative to insecticides. This method is highly efficient and safe for human health and environment. The likelihood of insect resistance development is very low and can be handled by adjusting the pheromone composition. The high cost of chemically synthesized pheromones is the major barrier for the wider adoption of pheromones. A novel method based on yeast fermentation enables the production of insect sex pheromones as a lower cost from renewable feedstocks.",

    "abstract": "The ability to characterize repetitive regions of the human genome is limited by the read lengths of short-read sequencing technologies. Although long-read sequencing technologies such as Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore can potentially overcome this limitation, long segmental duplications with high sequence identity pose challenges for long-read mapping. We describe a probabilistic method, DuploMap, designed to improve the accuracy of long read mapping in segmental duplications. It analyzes reads mapped to segmental duplications using existing long-read aligners and leverages paralogous sequence variants (PSVs) - sequence differences between paralogous sequences - to distinguish between multiple alignment locations. On simulated datasets, Duplomap increased the percentage of correctly mapped reads with high confidence for multiple long-read aligners including Minimap2 (74.3% to 90.6%) and BLASR (82.9% to 90.7%) while maintaining high precision. Across multiple whole-genome long-read datasets, DuploMap aligned an additional 8-21% of the reads in segmental duplications with high confidence relative to Minimap2. Using Duplomap aligned PacBio CCS reads, an additional 8.9 Mbp of DNA sequence was mappable, variant calling achieved a higher F1-score and 14,713 additional variants supported by linked-read data were identified. Finally, we demonstrate that a significant fraction of PSVs in segmental duplications overlap with variants and adversely impact short-read variant calling.",

    "abstract": "Despite being one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths, there is an unmet clinical need for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The lack of effective treatment is, at least in part, due to our lack of understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease. Oncofetal protein SALL4 is re-activated in patients with aggressive HCC along with other solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. This study identifies a previously unrecognized mechanism of SALL4 reactivation which is mediated by pseudogene-induced demethylation. Using a locus-specific demethylating technology, we identified the critical CpG region for SALL4 expression. We showed that SALL4 pseudogene 5 hypomethylates this region through interaction with DNMT1, resulting in SALL4 upregulation. Intriguingly, pseudogene 5 is significantly upregulated in a hepatitis B virus (HBV) model prior to SALL4 induction, and both are increased in HBV-HCC patients. Our results suggest that pseudogene-mediated demethylation represents a unique mechanism of oncogene activation in cancer.\n\nSignificanceOur study provides a mechanistic link between HBV infection, activation of the oncogene SALL4, and HCC. We reveal a previously undescribed capability of a pseudogene to epigenetically activate an oncogene by demethylation in a locus-specific manner.",

However, despite being first introduced nearly two decades ago, it has hardly been adopted by the evolutionary genetics community studying wild organisms. Here, genomic prediction is performed on eight traits in a wild population of Soay sheep. The population has been the focus of a >30 year evolutionary ecology study and there is already considerable understanding of the genetic architecture of the focal Mendelian and quantitative traits. We show that the accuracy of genomic prediction is high for all traits, but especially those with loci of large effect segregating. Five different methods are compared, and the two methods that can accommodate zero-effect and large-effect loci in the same model tend to perform best. If the accuracy of genomic prediction is similar in other wild populations, then there is a real opportunity for pedigree-free molecular quantitative genetics research to be enabled in many more wild populations; currently the literature is dominated by studies that have required decades of field data collection to generate sufficiently deep pedigrees. Finally, some of the potential applications of genomic prediction in wild populations are discussed.",

Use of synthetic cannabinoids during pregnancy may affect fetal brain development, and such effects could be moderated by the genetic makeup of an individual. Disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is a gene with important roles in neurodevelopment which has been associated with psychiatric disorders in pedigree analyses. Using zebrafish as a model, we investigated (1) the behavioral impact of developmental exposure to JWH-018 (a common psychoactive synthetic cannabinoid) and (2) whether disc1 moderates the effects of JWH-018. As altered anxiety responses are seen in a several psychiatric disorders, we focused on zebrafish anxiety-like behavior. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to JWH-018 from one to six days post-fertilization. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed using forced light/dark and acoustic startle assays in larvae, and novel tank diving in adults. Compared to controls, developmentally exposed zebrafish larvae had impaired locomotion during the forced light/dark test, but anxiety levels and response to startle stimuli was unaltered. Adult zebrafish developmentally exposed to JWH-018 spent less time on the bottom of the tank, suggesting decreased anxiety. Loss-of-function in disc1 increased anxiety but did not alter sensitivity to JWH-018. Results suggest developmental exposure to JWH-018 has behavioral impact in zebrafish, which is not moderated by disc1.",

How animals that rely on auditory learning for acoustic communication form sound preferences is not known. Fruit flies are a recently proposed novel animal model for studying experience-dependent auditory perceptual plasticity because of their ability to acquire song preferences via song exposure. Whether fruit flies have innate courtship song preferences, however, is unclear. Here we report that, similar to songbirds, fruit flies exhibit an innate preference for conspecific courtship songs. Maintenance of innate song preference requires song input, reminiscent of the song learning process in songbirds. Our findings also indicate that the response to conspecific and heterospecific songs manifests temporal and experience-dependent differentiation, which may underlie innate song preference and its plasticity. In addition, we find that flies have a robust ability to reacquire song preference during aging. Fruit flies thus offer a novel and simple approach for studying sound preference formation and its underlying mechanisms.",

Previously, the SRK and SCR genes of Arabidopsis lyrata were introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana transformants to generate self-incompatible lines. However, it has not been reported that the SRK and SCR genes of Brassica species confer self-incompatibility in A. thaliana. In this study, we attempted to construct self-incompatible A. thaliana transformants expressing the self-recognition activity of Brassica rapa by introducing the BrSCR gene along with a chimeric BrSRK gene (BrSRK chimera, in which the kinase domain of BrSRK was replaced with that of AlSKRb). We found that BrSRK chimera and BrSCR of B. rapa S-9 and S-46 haplotypes, but not those of S-29, S-44, and S-60 haplotypes, conferred self-recognition activity in A. thaliana. We also investigated the importance of amino acid residues involved in the BrSRK9-BrSCR9 interaction using A. thaliana transformants expressing mutant variants of BrSRK-9 chimera and BrSCR-9. The results showed that some of the amino acid residues are essential for self-recognition. The method developed in this study for the construction of self-incompatible A. thaliana transformants showing B. rapa self-recognition activity will be useful for analysis of self-recognition mechanisms in Brassicaceae.",

    "abstract": "The red macroalgae (seaweed) Asparagopsis spp. has shown to reduce ruminant enteric methane (CH4) production up to 99% in vitro. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Asparagopsis taxiformis on CH4 production (g/day per animal), CH4 yield (g CH4/kg dry matter intake (DMI)), average daily gain (ADG), feed conversion efficiency (FCE), and carcass and meat quality in growing beef steers. Twenty-one Angus-Hereford beef steers were randomly allocated to one of three treatment groups: 0% (Control), 0.25% (Low Dose; LD), and 0.5% (High Dose; HD) A. taxiformis inclusion based on organic matter intake. Steers were fed 3 diets: high, medium, and low forage total mixed ration (TMR) representing typical life-stage diets of growing beef steers. The LD and HD treatments over 147 days reduced enteric CH4 yield 45 and 68%, respectively; however, there was an interaction between TMR type and the magnitude of CH4 yield reduction. Supplementing the low forage TMR reduced CH4 yield 69.8% (P <0.001) for LD and 80% (P <0.001) for HD treatment. Hydrogen (H2) yield (g H2/DMI) increased significantly (P<0.001) 336 and 590% compared to Control for the LD and HD treatments, respectively. No differences were found in carbon dioxide (CO2) yield (g CO2/DMI), ADG, carcass quality, strip loin proximate analysis and shear force, or consumer taste preferences. DMI tended (P = 0.08) to decrease 8% in steers in LD treatment but significantly (P = 0.002) reduced 14% in steers in HD treatment. Conversely, FCE tended to increase 7% in steers in LD treatment (P = 0.06) and increased 14% in steers in HD (P < 0.01) treatment compared to Control. The persistent reduction of CH4 by A. taxiformis supplementation suggests that this is a viable feed additive to significantly decrease the carbon footprint of ruminant livestock and potentially increase production efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The sequential rather than simultaneous consumption of carbohydrates in bacteria such as E. coli, a phenomenon termed diauxie, has been hypothesized to be an evolutionary strategy which allows the organism to maximize its instantaneous specific growth, thus giving the bacterium a competitive advantage. Currently, computational techniques used in industrial biotechnology fall short of explaining the intracellular dynamics underlying diauxic behavior, in particular at a proteome level.\n\nSome hypotheses postulate that diauxie is due to limitations in the catalytic capacity of bacterial cells. We developed a robust iterative dynamic method based on expression- and thermodynamically enabled flux models (dETFL) to simulate the temporal evolution of carbohydrate consumption and cellular growth. The dETFL method couples gene expression and metabolic networks at the genome scale, and successfully predicts the preferential uptake of glucose over lactose in E. coli cultures grown on a mixture of carbohydrates. The observed diauxic behavior in the simulated cellular states suggests that the observed diauxic behavior is supported by a switch in the content of the proteome in response to fluctuations in the availability of extracellular carbon sources. We are able to model both the proteome allocation and the proteomic switch latency induced by different types of cultures.\n\nOur models suggest that the diauxic behavior of the cell is the result of the evolutionary objective of maximization of the specific growth of the cell. We propose that genetic regulatory networks, such as the lac operon in E. coli, are the biological implementation of a robust control system to ensure optimal growth.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a degradative cellular pathway that targets cytoplasmic contents and organelles for turnover by the lysosome. Various autophagy pathways play key roles in the clearance of viral infections, and many families of viruses have developed unique methods for avoiding degradation. Some positive stranded RNA viruses, such as enteroviruses and flaviviruses, usurp the autophagic pathway to promote their own replication. We previously identified the endoplasmic reticulum-localized protein BPIFB3 as an important regulator of non-canonical autophagy that uniquely impacts the replication of enteroviruses and flaviviruses. Here, we find that many components of the canonical autophagy machinery are not required for BPIFB3-regulated autophagy and identify the host factors that facilitate its role in the replication of enteroviruses and flaviviruses. Using proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) followed by mass spectrometry, we identify ARFGAP1 and TMED9 as two cellular components that interact with BPIFB3 to regulate autophagy and viral replication. Importantly, our data demonstrate that non-canonical autophagy in mammalian cells can be controlled outside of the traditional pathway regulators and define the role of two proteins in BPIFB3-mediated non-canonical autophagy.\n\nSummary StatementBPIFB3 is a regulator of a non-canonical cellular autophagy pathway that impacts the replication of enteroviruses and flaviviruses. Here we define ARFGAP1 and TMED9 as essential components of this pathway.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal aberrations and structural variations are a major cause of human genetic diseases. Their detection in clinical routine still relies on standard cytogenetics, karyotyping and CNV-microarrays, in spite of the low resolution of the first one and the inability to detect neither balanced SVs nor to provide the genomic localization or the orientation of duplicated segments, of the latter. We here investigated the clinical utility of high resolution optical mapping by genome imaging for patients carrying known chromosomal aberrations in a context of constitutional conditions.\n\nFor 85 samples, ultra-high molecular weight gDNA was isolated either from blood or cultured cells. After labeling, DNA was processed and imaged on the Saphyr instrument (Bionano Genomics). A de novo genome assembly was performed followed by SV and CNV calling and annotation. Results were compared to known aberrations from standard-of-care tests (karyotype, FISH and/or CNV-microarray).\n\nIn total, we analyzed 100 chromosomal aberrations including 7 aneuploidies, 35 translocations, 6 inversions, 2 insertions, 39 copy number variations (20 deletions and 19 duplications), 6 isochromosomes, 1 ring chromosome and 4 complex rearrangements. High resolution optical mapping reached 100% concordance compared to standard assays for all aberrations with non-centromeric breakpoints.\n\nOur study demonstrates the ability of high resolution optical mapping to detect almost all types of chromosomal aberrations within the spectrum of karyotype, FISH and CNV-microarray. These results highlight its potential to replace these techniques, and provide a cost-effective and easy-to-use technique that would allow for comprehensive detection of chromosomal aberrations.",

    "abstract": "Flower opening and closure are traits of reproductive importance in all angiosperms because they determine the success of self- and cross-pollination. The temporal nature of this phenotype rendered it a difficult target for genetic studies. Cultivated and wild lettuce, Lactuca spp., have composite inflorescences comprised of multiple florets that open only once. Different accessions were observed to flower at different times of day. An F6 recombinant inbred line population (RIL) had been derived from accessions of L. serriola x L. sativa that originated from different environments and differed markedly for daily floral opening time. This population was used to map the genetic determinants of this trait; the floral opening time of 236 RILs was scored over a seven-hour period using time-course image series obtained by drone-based remote phenotyping on two occasions, one week apart. Floral pixels were identified from the images using a support vector machine (SVM) machine learning algorithm with an accuracy above 99%. A Bayesian inference method was developed to extract the peak floral opening time for individual genotypes from the time-stamped image data. Two independent QTLs, qDFO2.1 (Daily Floral Opening 2.1) and qDFO8.1, were discovered. Together, they explained more than 30% of the phenotypic variation in floral opening time. Candidate genes with non-synonymous polymorphisms in coding sequences were identified within the QTLs. This study demonstrates the power of combining remote imaging, machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and genome-wide marker data for studying the genetics of recalcitrant phenotypes such as floral opening time.\n\nOne sentence summaryMachine learning and Bayesian analyses of drone-mediated remote phenotyping data revealed two genetic loci regulating differential daily flowering time in lettuce (Lactuca spp.).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEnterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an enteric pathogen responsible for the majority of diarrheal cases worldwide. ETEC infections are estimated to cause 80,000 fatalities per year, with the highest rates of burden, ca 75 million cases per year, amongst children under five years of age in resource-poor countries. It is also the leading cause of diarrhoea in travellers. Previous large-scale sequencing studies have found seven major ETEC lineages currently in circulation worldwide.\n\nResultsWe used PacBio long-read sequencing combined with Illumina sequencing to create high-quality complete reference genomes for each of the major lineages with manually curated chromosomes and plasmids. The plasmids carrying ETEC virulence genes were compared to other available long-read sequenced ETEC strains using blastn. The ETEC reference strains harbour between two and five plasmids, including virulence, antibiotic resistance and phage-plasmids. The virulence plasmids carrying the colonisation factors are highly conserved as shown by comparison with plasmids with other ETEC strains and confirm that the plasmids and chromosomes of ETEC are both crucial for ETEC virulence and success as pathogens.\n\nConclusionWe confirm that the major ETEC lineages all harbour conserved plasmids that have been associated with their respective background genomes for decades. The in-depth analysis of gene content, synteny and correct annotations of plasmids will elucidate other plasmids with and without virulence factors in related bacterial species. These reference genomes allow for fast and accurate comparison between different ETEC strains, and these data will form the foundation of ETEC genomics research for years to come.",

    "abstract": "In recent years there has been growing evidence regarding the effect of microbiota on the skeletal growth and homeostasis. Here we present, for the first time, accelerated longitudinal and radial bone growth in young (7-week-old) germ-free male rats after short-term exposure to a newly established gut microbiota. Changes in bone mass and structure were analyzed after 10 days following the onset of colonization through cohousing with conventional rats and revealed unprecedented acceleration of bone accrual in cortical and trabecular compartments, increased bone tissue mineral density, improved proliferation and hypertrophy of growth plate chondrocytes, bone lengthening, and preferential deposition of periosteal bone in tibia diaphysis. In addition, the number of small-in-size adipocytes increased, while the number of megakaryocytes decreased, in the bone marrow of conventionalized germ-free rats. The observed changes in bone status were paralleled with a positive shift in microbiota composition towards short chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing microbes, which reflected a dramatic increase in cecal concentration of SCFA, specifically butyrate. Further, reconstitution of the host holobiont increased hepatic expression of IGF-1 and its circulating levels, implicating an involvement of the somatotropic axis. Increased serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase pointed toward an active process of bone formation. The acute stimulatory effect on bone growth occurred independently of body mass increase and resembled reversal of dysbiosis in adolescence, which is marked by rapid skeletal expansion. These findings may help in developing microbiota-based therapeutics to combat bone related disorders resulting from hormonal defects and/or malnutrition in children and adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Large single-cell atlases are now routinely generated with the aim of serving as reference to analyse future smaller-scale studies. Yet, learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources, and sharing restrictions on raw data. Leveraging advances in machine learning, we propose a deep learning strategy to map query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches, https://github.com/theislab/scarches). It uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building, and the contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, and whole organism atlases, we showcase that scArches preserves nuanced biological state information while removing batch effects in the data, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters compared to de novo integration. To demonstrate mapping disease variation, we show that scArches preserves detailed COVID-19 disease variation upon reference mapping, enabling discovery of new cell identities that are unseen during training. We envision our method to facilitate collaborative projects by enabling the iterative construction, updating, sharing, and efficient use of reference atlases.",

    "abstract": "In the Neotropics, vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) are the main reservoir host for rabies, a highly fatal encephalitis caused by viruses in the genus Lyssavirus. Although patterns of rabies virus exposure and infection have been well-studied for vampire bats in South America and Mexico, exploring the ecology of vampire bat rabies in other regions is crucial for predicting risks to livestock and humans. In Belize, rabies outbreaks in livestock have increased in recent years, underscoring the need for systematic data on viral dynamics in vampire bats. In this study, we examine the first three years of a longitudinal study on the ecology of vampire bat rabies in northern Belize. Rabies seroprevalence in bats was high across years (29-80%), suggesting active and endemic virus circulation. Across two locations, the seroprevalence time series per site were inversely related and out of phase by at least a year. Microsatellite data demonstrated historic panmixia of vampire bats, and mark-recapture detected rare but contemporary inter-site dispersal. This degree of movement could facilitate spatial spread of rabies virus but is likely insufficient to synchronize infection dynamics, which offers one explanation for the observed phase lag in seroprevalence. More broadly, our analyses suggest frequent transmission of rabies virus within and among vampire bat roosts in northern Belize and highlight the need for future spatiotemporal, phylogenetic, and ecological studies of vampire bat rabies in Central America.",

    "abstract": "Chronic-wasting disease (CWD) is a prion-derived fatal neurodegenerative disease that has affected wild cervid populations on a global scale. Susceptibility has been linked unambiguously to several amino acid variants within the prion protein gene (PRNP). Quantifying their distribution across landscapes can provide critical information for agencies attempting to adaptively manage CWD. Here we attempt to further define management implications of PRNP polymorphism by quantifying the contemporary geographic distribution (i.e., phylogeography) of PRNP variants in hunter-harvested white-tailed deer (WTD; Odocoileus virginianus, N=1433) distributed across Arkansas (USA), including a focal spot for CWD since detection of the disease in February 2016. Of these, PRNP variants associated with the well-characterized 96S non-synonymous substitution showed a significant increase in relative frequency among older CWD-positive cohorts. We interpreted this pattern as reflective of a longer life expectancy for 96S genotypes in a CWD-endemic region, suggesting either decreased probabilities of infection or reduced disease progression. Other variants showing statistical signatures of potential increased susceptibility, however, seemingly do so as an artefact of population structure. We also showed marked heterogeneity across the landscape in the prevalence of  reduced susceptibility genotypes. This may indicate, in turn, that differences in disease susceptibility among WTD in Arkansas are an innate, population-level characteristic that is detectable through phylogeographic analysis.",

    "abstract": "Tumor-specific T cells likely underpin effective immune checkpoint-blockade therapies. Yet, most studies focus on Treg cells and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Here we study CD4+ TILs in human lung and colorectal cancers and observe that non-Treg CD4+ TILs average more than 70% of total CD4+ TILs in both cancer types. Leveraging high dimensional analyses including mass cytometry and single-cell sequencing, we reveal that CD4+ TILs are heterogeneous at both gene and protein levels, within each tumor and across patients. Consistently, we find different subsets of CD4+ TILs showing characteristics of effectors, tissue resident memory (Trm) or exhausted cells (expressing PD-1, CTLA-4 and CD39). In both cancer types, the frequencies of CD39- non-Treg CD4+ TILs strongly correlate with frequencies of CD39- CD8+ TILs, which we and others have previously shown to be enriched for cells specific for cancer-unrelated antigens (bystanders). Ex-vivo, we demonstrate that CD39- CD4+ TILs can be specific for cancer unrelated antigens, such as HCMV epitopes. Overall, our findings highlight that CD4+ TILs cells are not necessarily tumor-specific and suggest measuring CD39 expression as a straightforward way to quantify or isolate bystander CD4+ T cells.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=158 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/204172v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13de05org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@553e34org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@66e9f1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8903ca_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Specifically, we introduce ImmGen MNP Open Source dataset that profiled 337 samples and extended previous ImmGen effort which included 202 samples of mononuclear phagocytes and their progenitors. Next, we analysed Tabula Muris Senis dataset to extract data for 51,364 myeloid cells from 18 tissues. Taken together, a compendium of data assembled in this work covers phagocytic populations found across 38 different tissues. To analyse common metabolic features, we developed novel network-based computational approach for unbiased identification of key metabolic subnetworks based on cellular transcriptional profiles in large-scale datasets. Using ImmGen MNP Open Source dataset as baseline, we define 9 metabolic subnetworks that encapsulate the metabolic differences within mononuclear phagocytes, and demonstrate that these features are robustly found across all three datasets, including lipid metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, glycolysis, and a set of fatty acid related metabolic pathways, as well as nucleotide and folate metabolism. We systematically define major features specific to macrophage and dendritic cell subpopulations. Among other things, we find that cholesterol synthesis appears particularly active within the migratory dendritic cells. We demonstrate that interference with this pathway through statins administration diminishes migratory capacity of the dendritic cells in vivo. This result demonstrates the power of our approach and highlights importance of metabolic diversity among mononuclear phagocytes.",

We report here on K17-dependent differences in nuclear morphology, chromatin organization, and cell proliferation. Human tumor keratinocyte cell lines lacking K17 exhibit flatter nuclei relative to normal. Re-expression of wildtype K17, but not a mutant form lacking an intact nuclear localization signal (NLS), rescues nuclear morphology in KRT17 null cells. Analyses of primary cultures of skin keratinocytes from a mouse strain expressing K17 with a mutated NLS corroborated these findings. Proteomics screens identified K17-interacting nuclear proteins with known roles in gene expression, chromatin organization, and RNA processing. Key histone modifications and LAP2{beta} localization within the nucleus are altered in the absence of K17, correlating with decreased cell proliferation and suppression of GLI1 target genes. Nuclear K17 thus impacts nuclear morphology with an associated impact on chromatin organization, gene expression, and proliferation in epithelial cells.\n\nSummaryKeratin 17 (K17) is one of two non-lamin intermediate filament proteins recently identified to localize to and function in the cell nucleus.

Here we demonstrate two approaches to deal with background contamination as well as profiling of unwanted cells in the assays. We use three real-life datasets of whole-cell capture and nucleotide single-cell captures generated by Fluidigm and 10x technologies and show that these methods reduce the effect of contamination, strengthen clustering of cells and improves biological interpretation.",

    "abstract": "Fragmentation of natural landscapes results in habitat and connectedness loss, making it one of the most impactful avenues of anthropogenic environmental degradation. Populations living in a fragmented landscape can adapt to this context, as witnessed in changing dispersal strategies, levels of local adaptation and changing life-history traits. This evolution, however, can have ecological consequences beyond a fragmented range. Since invasive dynamics are driven by the same traits affected by fragmentation, the question arises whether fragmented populations evolve to be successful invaders.\n\nIn this study we assess population spread during three generations of two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae) population in a replicated experiment. Experimental populations evolved independently in replicated experimental metapopulations differing only in the level of habitat connectedness as determined by the inter-patch distance.\n\nWe find that habitat connectedness did not meaningfully explain variation in population spread rate. Rather, variation within experimental populations that shared the same level of connectedness during evolution was larger than the one across these levels. Therefore, we conclude that experimental populations evolved different population spread capacities as a result of their specific evolutionary background independent but of the connectedness of the landscape. While population spread capacities may be strongly affected by aspects of a populations evolutionary history, predicting it from identifiable aspects of the evolutionary history may be hard to achieve.",

    "abstract": "Plants adjust their growth orientations in response to environmental signals such as light and gravity in order to optimize photosynthesis and access to nutrients. However, given the fixed nature of gravity, understanding how light and gravity signals are integrated is challenging. Branch orientation, or gravitropic set point angle, is a key aspect of plant architecture, set with respect to gravity and shown to be altered by changes in light conditions. The IGT gene family, also known as the LAZY family, contains important components for branch angle and gravity responses, including three gene clades: LAZY, DEEPER ROOTING (DRO), and TILLER ANGLE CONTROL (TAC). LAZY and DRO genes promote upward branch orientations downstream of amyloplast sedimentation, and upstream of auxin redistribution in response to gravity. In contrast, TAC1 promotes downward branch angles in response to photosynthetic signals. Here, we investigated the influence of different light signaling pathways on LAZY and DRO gene expression, and their role in light regulation of branch angle responses. We found differential effects of continuous light and dark, circadian clock, photoreceptor-mediated signaling, and photosynthetic signals on LAZY and DRO gene expression. Phenotypic analysis revealed that LAZY and DRO genes are collectively required for branch angle responses to light.\n\nHighlightLAZY and DRO gene expression responds differentially to changes in light regime and signaling. Loss of multiple LAZY and DRO genes leads to loss of branch angle response to light.",

    "abstract": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium relictum is one of the most widespread species of avian malaria. As is the case in its human counterparts, bird Plasmodium undergoes a complex life cycle infecting two hosts: the arthropod vector and the vertebrate host. In this study, we examine the transcriptome of P. relictum (SGS1) during crucial timepoints within its natural vector, Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus. Differential gene-expression analyses identified genes linked to the parasites life-stages at: i) a few minutes after the blood meal is ingested, ii) during peak oocyst production phase, iii) during peak sporozoite phase and iv) during the late-stages of the infection. A large amount of genes coding for functions linked to host-immune invasion and multifunctional genes was active throughout the infection cycle. One gene associated with a conserved Plasmodium membrane protein with unknown function was upregulated throughout the parasite development in the vector, suggesting an important role in the successful completion of the sporogonic cycle. Transcript annotation further revealed novel genes, which were significantly differentially expressed during the infection in the vector as well as upregulation of reticulocyte-binding proteins, which raises the possibility of the multifunctionality of these RBPs. We establish the existence of highly stage-specific pathways being overexpressed during the infection. This first study of gene-expression of a non-human Plasmodium species in its natural vector provides a comprehensive insight into the molecular mechanisms of the common avian malaria parasite P. relictum and provides essential information on the evolutionary diversity in gene regulation of the Plasmodiums vector stages.",

    "abstract": "Gene essentiality studies have been performed on numerous bacterial pathogens, but essential gene sets have been determined for only a few plant-associated bacteria. Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 is a plant-commensal, biocontrol bacteria that can control disease-causing pathogens on a wide range of crops. Work on Pf-5 has mostly focused on secondary metabolism and biocontrol genes, but genome-wide approaches such as high-throughput transposon mutagenesis have not yet been used in this species. Here we generated a dense P. protegens Pf-5 transposon mutant library and used transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS) to identify 446 genes essential for growth on rich media. Genes required for fundamental cellular machinery were enriched in the essential gene set, while genes related to nutrient biosynthesis, stress responses and transport were under-represented. Comparison of the essential gene sets of Pf-5 and P. aeruginosa PA14, an opportunistic human pathogen, provides insight into the biological processes important for their different lifestyles. Key differences include cytochrome c biogenesis, formation of periplasmic disulfide bonds, lipid biosynthesis, ribonuclease activity, lipopolysaccharides and cell surface structures. Comparison of the Pf-5 in silico predicted and in vitro determined essential gene sets highlighted the essential cellular functions that are over- and underestimated by each method. Expanding essentiality studies into bacteria with a range of lifestyles can improve our understanding of the biological processes important for survival and growth in different environmental niches.\n\nImportanceEssential genes are those crucial for survival or normal growth rates in an organism. Essential gene sets have been identified in numerous bacterial pathogens, but only a few plant-associated bacteria. Employing genome-wide approaches, such as transposon insertion sequencing, allows for the concurrent analysis of all genes of a bacterial species and rapid determination of essential gene sets. We have used transposon insertion sequencing to systematically analyze thousands of Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 genes and gain insights into gene functions and interactions that are not readily available using traditional methods. Comparing Pf-5 essential genes with those of P. aeruginosa PA14, an opportunistic human pathogen, provides insight into differences in gene essentiality which may be linked to their different lifestyles.",

Here we describe a pathway from spinal cord to brain for ongoing pain. Activation of a defined subset of spinal projection neurons expressing Tacr1 evokes a full repertoire of somatotopically-directed coping behaviors in the absence of noxious input. These cells project to a tiny cluster of Tacr1-positive neurons in the superior lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBN-SL) that themselves are responsive to sustained but not acute noxious stimuli. Activation of these PBN-SLTacr1 neurons alone does not trigger pain responses but instead serves to dramatically heighten nocifensive behaviors and suppress itch. Remarkably, mice with silenced PBN-SLTacr1 neurons ignore long-lasting noxious stimuli. These data reveal a spinoparabrachial pathway that plays a key role in the sensation of ongoing pain.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionEvolution of phenotypic diversity among viruses occurs as an escape mechanism against host immune pressure or drug selective pressure. Among HIV/HBV co-infected individuals, various HBV basal core promoter (BCP)/precore (PC) region molecular mutants had been reported with associated phenotypic defect in HBeAg production. The emergence of HBeAg negative variants of HBV in HIV co-infected individuals have profound implication on the diagnosis, management and prognosis of this subset of individuals. This includes delayed clearance of HBV, early development of adverse hepatic events such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, little is known about HBV BCP/PC region genomic heterogeneity in HIV/HBV co-infected patients in Nigeria. Therefore, this study was focussed on investigating evidence of precore/core region genomic variability among HIV/HBV co-infected patients in Nigeria.\n\nMaterials and methodsA total of 40 patients (20 HIV/HBV co-infected and 20 HBV mono-infected samples) were enrolled into the study and subsequently tested for HBsAg, HBeAg and HBeAb using specific Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The BCP/PC genome regions (nucleotides 1653-1959) were amplified using a nested PCR assay and then subjected to BCP/PC mutational analysis in genome sites affecting HBeAg expression especially at the BCP transcriptional and PC Translational stop codon sites.\n\nResultsOverall, 5(83.3%) of the six exploitable sequences after analysis showed various BCP/PC mutations. Only 1(16.6%) sequence from an HIV/HBV co-infected patient had the BCP transcriptional (double mutation; A1762T/G1764A) mutant. Analysis of the PC translational stop codon showed 4 (66.6%) having the G1896A mutants while 33.3% (2) had G1899A mutants.\n\nConclusionThis study has broadened the available evidence of BCP/PC region molecular mutants among HIV/HBV co-infected patients in Nigeria and assessed the difference of mutation prevalence in comparison with HBV mono-infected cohort. We therefore recommend that HIV/HBV co-infected patients be routinely screened for hepatitis B virus precore region mutants to improve their patient outcome.",

We collected ERPs while participants listened to Russian pronoun-verb phrases recorded in either male or female voice. We manipulated congruency between the grammatical gender signaled by the verbs ending and the speakers apparent gender. We registered both early and late phrase processing signatures in the incongruent conditions including ELAN (peaking at [~]150 ms) and N400.

    "abstract": "Cargo proteins of the type IX secretion system (T9SS) in human pathogens from phylum Bacteroidetes invariably possess a conserved C-terminal domain (CTD) that functions as a signal for outer membrane (OM) translocation. In Porphyromonas gingivalis, the CTD of selected cargos is cleaved off after translocation, and anionic lipopolysaccharide (A-LPS) is attached. This transpeptidase reaction anchors secreted proteins to the OM. PorZ, a cell surface-associated protein, is an essential component of the T9SS whose function was previously unknown. We recently solved the crystal structure of PorZ, and found that it consists of two {beta}-propeller moieties followed by a CTD. In this study, we performed structure-based modelling suggesting that PorZ is a carbohydrate-binding protein. We found that recombinant PorZ specifically binds A-LPS. Binding was blocked by monoclonal antibodies that specifically react with a phosphorylated branched mannan in the anionic polysaccharide (A-PS) component of the A-LPS, but not with the core oligosaccharide or the lipid A endotoxin. Examination of A-LPS derived from a cohort of mutants producing various truncations of A-PS confirmed that the phosphorylated branched mannan is indeed the PorZ ligand. Moreover, purified recombinant PorZ interacted with the PorU sortase in an A-LPS-dependent manner. This interaction on the cell surface is crucial for the function of the attachment complex composed of PorU, PorZ, and the integral OM {beta}-barrel proteins PorV and PorQ, which is involved in post-translational modification and retention of T9SS cargos on the bacterial surface.\n\nAuthor summaryBacteria have evolved multiple systems to transport effector proteins to their surface or into the surrounding milieu. These proteins have a wide range of functions, including attachment, motility, nutrient acquisition, and toxicity in the host. Porphyromonas gingivalis, the human pathogen responsible for severe gum diseases (periodontitis), uses a recently characterized type IX secretion system (T9SS) to translocate and anchor secreted virulence effectors to the cell surface. Anchorage is facilitated by sortase, an enzyme that covalently attaches T9SS cargo proteins to a unique anionic lipopolysaccharide (A-LPS) moiety of P. gingivalis. Here, we show that the T9SS component PorZ interacts with sortase and specifically binds A-LPS. Binding is mediated by a phosphorylated branched mannan repeat in A-LPS polysaccharide. A-LPS- bound PorZ interacts with sortase with significantly greater affinity, facilitating modification of cargo proteins by the cell-surface attachment complex of the T9SS.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAbsolute pitch (AP) refers to the ability of effortlessly identifying given pitches without the reliance on any reference pitch. Correlative evidence suggests that the left posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is responsible for the process underlying pitch labeling in AP.\n\nObjectiveHere, we aimed at investigating the causal relationship between the DLPFC and the pitch-labeling process underlying AP.\n\nMethodsTo address this, we measured sight-reading performance of right-handed AP possessors and matched control musicians (N =18 per sample) under cathodal and sham transcranial direct current stimulation of the left DLPFC. The participants were instructed to report visually presenting notations as accurately and fast as possible by playing with their right hand on a piano. The notations were simultaneously presented with distracting auditory stimuli that either matched or mismatched them in different semitone degrees.\n\nResultsUnlike the control participants, the AP possessors revealed an interference effect in that they responded slower in mismatching conditions than in the matching one. Under cathodal stimulation, half of the time discrepancies between matching and mismatching conditions vanished; specifically, the ones with small up to moderate deviations.\n\nConclusionsThese findings confirm that the pitch-labeling process underlying AP occurs automatically and is largely non-suppressible when triggered by tone exposure. The improvement of the AP possessors sight-reading performance in response to the suppression of the left DLPFC using cathodal stimulation confirms a causal relationship between this brain structure and pitch labeling.",

    "abstract": "Polymicrogyria (PMG) is a developmental cortical malformation characterized by an excess of small and frustrane gyration and abnormal cortical lamination. PMG frequently associates with seizures. The molecular pathomechanisms underlying PMG development are not yet understood. About 40 genes have been associated with PMG, and small copy number variations have also been described in selected patients. We recently provided evidence that epilepsy-associated structural brain lesions can be classified based on genomic DNA methylation patterns. Here we analyzed 26 PMG patients employing array-based DNA-methylation profiling on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material. A series of 62 well-characterized non-PMG cortical malformations (focal cortical dysplasia type 2a/b and hemimegalencephaly), temporal lobe epilepsy, and non-epilepsy autopsy controls was used as reference cohort. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction and hierarchical cluster analysis of DNA methylation profiles showed that PMG formed a distinct DNA methylation class. Copy number profiling from DNA methylation data identified a uniform duplication spanning the entire long arm of chromosome 1 in 7 out of 26 PMG patients, which was verified by additional fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. In respective cases about 50% of nuclei in the center of the PMG lesion were 1q triploid. No chromosomal imbalance was seen in adjacent, architecturally normal-appearing tissue indicating mosaicism. Clinically, PMG 1q patients presented with a unilateral frontal or hemispheric PMG without hemimegalencephaly, a severe form of intractable epilepsy with seizure onset in the first months of life, and severe developmental delay. Our results show that PMG can be classified among other structural brain lesions according to their DNA methylation profile. One subset of PMG with distinct clinical features exhibits a duplication of chromosomal arm 1q.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionMicroglia secretome includes not only growth factors and cytokines which support neuronal survival, it includes neurotoxic cytokines/enzymes, as well. MPTP is a neurotoxin which has degenerative effects on SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Masitinib mesylate is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has been shown to have beneficial effects in neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nAimWe first aimed to determine the most efficient microglial cell conditioned medium in terms of neurodegenerative effect. Next, we investigated the possible protective/therapeutic effects of masitinib against MPTP/microglia-induced degeneration of differentiated (d)-SH-SY5Y cells, and the role of transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta}1 and nitric oxide (NO) in these events.\n\nMaterial-MethodsNon-stimulated/LPS-stimulated microglia cells were treated with masitinib or its solvent, DMSO. With or without MPTP-d-SH-SY5Y cell cultures were exposed to the conditioned media (CM) from microglia cell cultures, followed by cell survival analysis. Immunofluorescence staining of microglia and d-SH-SY5Y cells were performed with anti-CD-11b and anti-PGP9.5 antibody, respectively. TGF-{beta}1/NO concentrations in CM of microglia/d-SH-SY5Y cell culture were measured.\n\nResultsThe initial 24 hrs CM of non-stimulated microglia cell culture was found to be the most detrimental microglial medium with lowest survival rates of treated d-SH-SY5Y cells. The toxicity of 48 and 72 hrs CM on d-SH-SY5Y cells were both lower than that of 24 hrs CM. Masitinib (0.5 {micro}M), significantly prevented MPTP-related cell degeneration of d-SH-SY5Y cells. It also decreased the degenerative effects of both non-induced/LPS-induced microglia CM on with or without MPTP-d-SH-SY5Y cells. Although NO levels in microglia CM showed a negative correlation with survival rates of treated d-SH-SY5Y cells, a positive correlation was seen between TGF-{beta}1 concentrations in microglial CM and rates of treated d-SH-SY5Y cell survival.\n\nConclusionMasitinib ameliorates viability of with/without MPTP-d-SH-SY5Y cells. It does not only reverse the degenerative effects of its solvent, DMSO, but also prevents the degenerative effects of microglial secretions and MPTP. We suggest that masitinib begins to act as a neuroprotective agent via mediating TGF-{beta}1 and NO secretion, as neurons are exposed to over-activated microglia or neurotoxins.",

The following three modeling strategies were compared: M1 (genome-based prediction), M2 (NIR-based prediction), and M3 (integration of genomics s and NIR wavenumbers). Data were collected from a commercial population comprised of three hundred and eighty-five individuals, genotyped for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and screened using NIR spectroscopy. We compared partial least squares (PLS) and BayesB regression methods to estimate marker and wavenumber effects. In order to assess model performance, we employed random sub-sampling cross-validation to calculate the mean Pearson correlation coefficient between observed and predicted genotypic values. Our results showed that models fitted using BayesB were most predictive than PLS models. We found that NIR (M2) provided the highest prediction accuracy, whereas genomics (M1) presented the lowest predictive ability, regardless of the measured traits and regression methods used. The integration of predictors derived from NIR spectroscopy and genomics into a single model (M3) did not significantly improve the prediction accuracy for the two traits evaluated. These findings suggest that NIR-based prediction can be an effective strategy for predicting the genotypic value of sugarcane clones.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is to determine whether manipulation of the drug transporter P-glycoprotein improves the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors in multiple myeloma cells. P-glycoprotein is a well-known drug transporter that is associated with chemotherapy resistance in a number of cancers but its role in modulating the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors in multiple myeloma is not well understood. Research has shown that the second generation proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib is a substrate of P-glycoprotein and as such its efficacy may correlate with P-glycoprotein activity. In contrast to carfilzomib, research concerning the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is inconsistent with some reports suggesting that inhibition of P-glycoprotein increases bortezomib cytotoxicity in multiple myeloma cells whereas others have shown no effect. Through the mining of publicly available gene expression microarrays of patient bone marrow, we show that P-glycoprotein gene expression increases with the disease stages leading to multiple myeloma. However, RNA-seq on LP-1 cells treated with bortezomib or carfilzomib demonstrated minimal basal P-glycoprotein expression which did not increase with treatment. Moreover, only one (KMS-18) of nine multiple myeloma cell lines expressed P-glycoprotein, including RPMI-8226 cells that are resistant to bortezomib or carfilzomib. We hypothesised that by inhibiting P-glycoprotein, multiple myeloma cell sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors would increase, thus providing a potential approach to improving responses and reversing resistance to these agents. However, the sensitivity of multiple myeloma cells lines to proteasome inhibition was not enhanced by inhibition of P-glycoprotein with the specific inhibitor tariquidar. In addition, targeting glucosylceramide synthase with eliglustat did not inhibit P-glycoprotein activity and also did not improve proteasome inhibitor efficacy except at a high concentration. We conclude that P-glycoprotein is poorly expressed in multiple myeloma cells, its inhibition does not enhance the efficacy of proteasome inhibitors, and it is unlikely to be a useful avenue for further translational research.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization estimates that almost 300 million people suffer from depression worldwide. Depression is the most common mental health disorder and shows racial disparities in disease prevalence, age of onset, severity of symptoms, frequency of diagnosis, and treatment utilization across the United States. Since depression has both social and genetic risk factors, we propose a conceptual model wherein social stressors are primary risk factors for depression, but genetic variants increase or decrease individual susceptibility to the effects of the social stressors. Our research strategy incorporates both social and genetic data to investigate variation in symptoms of depression (CES-D scores). We collected data on financial strain (difficulty paying bills) and personal social networks (a model of an individuals social environment), and we genotyped genetic variants in five genes involved in stress reactivity (HTR1a, BDNF, GNB3, SLC6A4, and FKBP5) in 135 African Americans residing in Tallahassee, Florida. We found that high financial strain and a high percentage of people in ones social network who are a source of stress or worry were significantly associated with higher CES-D scores and explained more variation in CES-D scores than did genetic factors. Only one genetic variant (rs1360780 in FKBP5) was significantly associated with CES-D scores and only when the social stressors were included in the model. Interestingly, the effect of FKPB5 appeared to be strongest in individuals with high financial strain such that participants with a T allele at rs1360780 in FKBP5 and high financial strain had the highest mean CES-D scores in our study population. These results suggest that material disadvantage and a stressful social environment increases the risk of depression, but that individual-level genetic variation may increase susceptibility to the adverse health consequences of social stressors.",

    "abstract": "Due to the large number of negative tests, individually screening large populations for rare pathogens can be wasteful and expensive. Sample pooling methods improve the efficiency of large-scale pathogen screening campaigns by reducing the number of tests and reagents required to accurately categorize positive and negative individuals. Such methods rely on group testing theory which mainly focuses on minimizing the total number of tests; however, many other practical concerns and tradeoffs must be considered when choosing an appropriate method for a given set of circumstances. Here we use computational simulations to determine how several theoretical approaches compare in terms of (a) the number of tests, to minimize costs and save reagents, (b) the number of sequential steps, to reduce the time it takes to complete the assay, (c) the number of samples per pool, to avoid the limits of detection, (d) simplicity, to reduce the risk of human error, and (e) robustness, to poor estimates of the number of positive samples. We found that established methods often perform very well in one area but very poorly in others. Therefore, we introduce and validate a new method which performs fairly well across each of the above criteria making it a good general use approach.",

This topographic molecular-psychological signature reflects the hierarchical organization of the neocortex, including systematic variations in cell type, myeloarchitecture, laminar differentiation, and intrinsic network affiliation. In addition, this molecular-psychological signature is related to individual differences in cognitive performance, strengthens over neurodevelopment, and can be replicated in two independent repositories.

    "abstract": "When mammals navigate in the physical environment, specific neurons such as grid-cells, head-direction cells, and place-cells activate to represent the navigable surface, the faced direction of movement, and the specific location the animal is visiting. Here we test the hypothesis that these codes are also activated when humans navigate abstract language-based representational spaces. Human participants learnt the meaning of novel words as arbitrary signs referring to specific artificial audiovisual objects varying in size and sound. Next, they were presented with sequences of words and asked to process them semantically while we recorded the activity of their brain using fMRI. Processing words in sequence was conceivable as movements in the semantic space, thus enabling us to systematically search for the different types of neuronal coding schemes known to represent space during navigation. By applying a combination of representational similarity and fMRI-adaptation analyses, we found evidence of i) a grid-like code in the right postero-medial entorhinal cortex, representing the general bidimensional layout of the novel semantic space; ii) a head-direction-like code in parietal cortex and striatum, representing the faced direction of movements between concepts; and iii) a place-like code in medial prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and mid cingulate cortices, representing the Euclidean distance between concepts. We also found evidence that the brain represents 1-dimensional distances between word meanings along individual sensory dimensions: implied size was encoded in secondary visual areas, and implied sound in Heschls gyrus/Insula. These results reveal that mentally navigating between 2D word meanings is supported by a network of brain regions hosting a variety of spatial codes, partially overlapping with those recruited for navigation in physical space.",

We trained mice in a task that probed decisions based on sensory evidence and reward value, and recorded the activity of striatal dopamine axons. Dopamine axons in ventral striatum (VS) responded to bilateral stimuli and trial outcomes, encoding prediction errors that scaled with decision confidence and reward value. By contrast, dopamine axons in dorsal striatum (DS) responded to contralateral stimuli and contralateral actions. Thus, during sensory decisions, striatal dopamine signals are anatomically organized.

Recently, quantitative mass spectrometry (qMS) based on data-dependent acquisition (DDA) have been widely used to understand the biogenesis and function of ribosomes. However, DDA-based qMS sometimes does not provide the reproducible and quantitatively reliable analysis that is needed for high-throughput hypothesis testing. To overcome this problem, we developed a highly sensitive, specific, and accurate method to quantify all ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) by combining selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and isotope labeling. We optimized the SRM methods using purified ribosomes and Escherichia coli lysates, and verified this approach as a high-throughput analytical tool by detecting 41 of the 54 r-proteins separately synthesized in E. coli S30 extracts. The SRM methods will enable us to utilize qMS as a high-throughput hypothesis testing tool in the research of E. coli ribosomes, and they have potential to accelerate the understanding of ribosome biogenesis, function, and the development of engineered ribosomes with additional functions.",

    "abstract": "Osteocalcin (OCN) is an osteoblast-derived hormone with pleiotropic physiological functions. Like many peptide hormones, OCN is subjected to post-translational modifications (PTMs) which control its activity. Here, we uncover O-glycosylation as a novel PTM present on mouse OCN and occurring on a single serine (S8) independently of its carboxylation and endoproteolysis, two other PTMs regulating this hormone. We also show that O-glycosylation increases OCN half-life in plasma ex vivo and in the circulation in vivo. Remarkably, in human OCN (hOCN), the residue corresponding to S8 is a tyrosine (Y12), which is not O-glycosylated. Yet, the Y12S mutation is sufficient to O-glycosylate hOCN and to increase its half-life in plasma compared to wildtype hOCN. These findings reveal an important species difference in OCN regulation, which may explain why serum concentrations of OCN are higher in mouse than in human.\n\nThe authors have nothing to disclose",

    "abstract": "Electromyography (EMG) is a simple, non-invasive, and cost-effective technology for sensing muscle activity. However, EMG is also noisy, complex, and high-dimensional. It has nevertheless been widely used in a host of human-machine-interface applications (electrical wheelchairs, virtual computer mice, prosthesis, robotic fingers, etc.) and in particular to measure reaching and grasping motions of the human hand. Here, we developd a more automated pipeline to predict object weight in a reach-and-grasp task from an open dataset relying only on EMG data. In that we shifted the focus from manual feature-engineering to automated feature-extraction by using raw (filtered) EMG signals and thus letting the algorithms select the features. We further compared intrinsic EMG features, derived from several dimensionality-reduction methods, and then ran some classification algorithms on these low-dimensional representations. We found that the Laplacian Eigenmap algorithm generally outperformed other dimensionality-reduction methods. What is more, optimal classification accuracy was achieved using a combination of Laplacian Eigenmaps (simple-minded) and k-Nearest Neighbors (88% for 3-way classification). Our results, using EMG alone, are comparable to others in the literature that used EMG and EEG together. They also demonstrate the usefulness of dimensionality reduction when classifying movement based on EMG signals and more generally the usefulness of EMG for movement classification.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWAt the typical walking speeds of healthy humans, step placement seems to be the primary strategy to maintain gait stability, with ankle torques and upper body momentum providing additional compensation. The average walking speeds of populations with an increased risk of falling, however, are much slower and may require differing control strategies. The purpose of this study was to analyze mediolateral gait stability and the contributions of the different control strategies at very slow walking speeds. We analyzed an open dataset including kinematics and kinetics from eight healthy subjects walking at speeds from 0.1 to 0.6 m/s as well as a self-selected speed. As gait speed slowed, we found that the margin of stability decreased linearly. Increased lateral excursions of the extrapolated centre of mass, caused by increased lateral excursions of the trunk, were not compensated for by an equivalent increase in the lateral centre of pressure, leading to decreased margin of stability. Additionally, both the ankle eversion torque and hip abduction torque at the minimum margin of stability event increased at the same rate as gait speed slowed. These results suggest that the contributions of both the ankle and the upper body to stability are more crucial than stepping at slow speeds, which have important implications for populations with slow gait and limited motor function.",

We have previously described the construction and characterization of generic and reusable blood transcriptional module repertoires. The third and latest version that we have recently made available comprises 382 functionally annotated gene sets (modules) and encompasses 14,168 transcripts. We developed R scripts for performing module repertoire analyses and custom fingerprint visualization. These are made available here along with detailed descriptions. An illustrative public transcriptome dataset and corresponding intermediate output files are also included as supplementary material. Briefly, the steps involved in module repertoire analysis and visualization include: First, the annotation of the gene expression data matrix with module membership information. Second, running of statistical tests to determine for each module the proportion of its constitutive genes which are differentially expressed. Third, the results are expressed \"at the module level\" as percent of genes increased or decreased and plotted in a fingerprint grid format. A parallel workflow has been developed for computing module repertoire changes for individual samples rather than groups of samples. Such results are plotted in a heatmap format. The use case that is presented illustrates the steps involved in the generation of blood transcriptome repertoire fingerprints of septic patients at both group and individual levels.",

    "abstract": "Robustness is a feature of regulatory pathways to ensure signal consistency in light of environmental changes or genetic polymorphisms. The retinoic acid (RA) pathway, is a central developmental and tissue homeostasis regulatory signal, strongly dependent on nutritional sources of retinoids and affected by environmental chemicals. This pathway is characterized by multiple proteins or enzymes capable of performing each step and their integration into a self-regulating network. We studied RA network robustness by transient physiological RA signaling disturbances followed by kinetic transcriptomic analysis of the recovery during embryogenesis. The RA metabolic network was identified as the main regulated module to achieve signaling robustness using an unbiased pattern analysis. We describe the network-wide responses to RA signal manipulation and found the feedback autoregulation to be sensitive to the direction of the RA perturbation: RA knockdown exhibited an upper response limit, whereas RA addition had a minimal feedback-activation threshold. Surprisingly, our robustness response analysis suggests that the RA metabolic network regulation exhibits a multi-objective optimization, known as Pareto optimization, characterized by trade-offs between competing functionalities. We observe that efficient robustness to increasing RA is accompanied by worsening robustness to reduced RA levels and vice versa. This direction-dependent trade-off in the network-wide feedback response, results in an uneven robustness capacity of the RA network during early embryogenesis, likely a significant contributor to the manifestation of developmental defects.",

The availability of high-quality annotation sets allowed us to compare the power of different metrics for measuring phenotypic profile similarity to correctly infer gene function. We conclude that there is no single best method; the three metrics tested gave comparable results for most gene pairs. We also assessed how converting qualitative phenotypes to discrete, qualitative phenotypes affected the association between phenotype and function. Our results indicate that this approach may allow phenotypic data from different studies to be combined to produce a larger dataset that may reveal functional connections between genes not detected in individual studies.",

Recent advances in immunotherapy responses have led to renewed interest in vaccine approaches, including dendritic cell vaccine strategies. However, dendritic cell requirements for vaccines that generate potent anti-tumor T-cell responses are unclear. Here we use mathematical modeling to show that counterintuitively, increasing levels of immature dendritic cells may lead to selective expansion of high-avidity CTLs. This finding contrasts with traditional dendritic cell vaccine approaches that have sought to harness ex vivo generated mature dendritic cells. We show that the injection of vaccine antigens in the context of increased numbers of immature dendritic cells results in a decreased overall peptide:MHC complex load that favors high-avidity CTL activation and expansion. Overall, our results provide a firm basis for further development of this approach, both alone and in combination with other immunotherapies such as checkpoint blockade.",

    "abstract": "The brain contains a diverse array of immune cell types. The phenotypic and functional plasticity of brain immune cells collectively contribute to brain tissue homeostasis and disease progression. Immune cell plasticity is profoundly influenced by local tissue microenvironment cues and systemic factors. Yet, the transcriptional mechanism by which systemic stimuli, such as aging and gut microbiota dysbiosis, reshape brain immune cell plasticity and homeostasis has not been fully delineated. Using Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq), we analyzed compositional and transcriptional changes of the brain immune landscape in response to aging and gut dysbiosis. We first examined the discordance between canonical surface marker-defined immune cell types (Cell-ID) and their transcriptome signatures, which suggested transcriptional plasticity among immune cells despite sharing the same cell surface markers. Specifically, inflammatory and patrolling Ly6C+ monocytes were shifted predominantly to a pro-inflammatory transcriptional program in the aged brain, while brain ILCs shifted toward an ILC2 transcriptional profile. Finally, aging led to an increase of ILC-like cells expressing a T memory stemness (Tscm) signature in the brain. Antibiotics (ABX)-induced gut dysbiosis reduced the frequency of ILCs exhibiting Tscm-like properties in the aged mice, but not in the young mice. Enabled by high-resolution single-cell molecular phenotyping, our study revealed that systemic changes due to aging and gut dysbiosis prime the brain environment for an increased propensity for neuroinflammation, which provided insights into gut dysbiosis in age-related neurological diseases.\n\nManuscript SummaryGolomb et al. performed Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by sequencing (CITE-seq) on immune cells from the brains of young and aged mice with and without antibiotics-induced gut dysbiosis. High resolution, single cell immunophenotyping enabled the dissection of extensive transcriptional plasticity of canonically identified monocytes and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the aged brain. Through differential gene expression and trajectory inference analyses, the authors revealed tissue microenvironment-dependent cellular responses influenced by aging and gut dysbiosis that may potentiate neuroinflammatory diseases.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

However, limited data are available on how the immunological and transcriptional response elicited by an attenuated challenge virus compares to that associated with a wild-type DENV infection. To bridge this knowledge gap, we utilized scRNAseq to analyze PBMC from individuals enrolled in a DENV-1 controlled human challenge study and from individuals experiencing a natural primary DENV-1 infection. While both controlled and natural DENV infection resulted in overlapping patterns of inflammatory gene upregulation, natural DENV infection was accompanied with a more pronounced suppression in gene products associated with protein translation and mitochondrial function, principally in monocytes. This suggests that the immune response elicited by controlled and natural primary DENV infection are similar, but that natural DENV infection has a more pronounced impact on basic cellular processes to induce a multi-layered anti-viral state",

The consequences of hepatic inflammation on recovery after injury, however, are unknown. Here, we hypothesize that liver inflammation at the time of spinal cord injury (SCI) will exacerbate spinal cord pathology and impair recovery. Rats receiving SCI with concomitant liver inflammation had worse intraspinal pathology and greater locomotor deficits than rats with baseline liver inflammation. Hepatic inflammation also potentiated SCI-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), endotoxemia, insulin resistance and adiposity. Circulating and cerebrospinal levels of Fetuin-A were higher in SCI rats with liver inflammation. When microinjected into intact spinal cords, Fetuin-A caused robust macrophage activation, iron accumulation and neuron loss. These studies verify that outcomes from CNS injury are worse if the liver is concomitantly inflamed and implicate Fetuin-A as a potential neuropathological mediator. These novel data suggest hepatic inflammation is a potential clinical target for improving recovery from SCI.",

Eight field treatments were studied, being three levels of organomineral (50, 100, 150%) of two organic matter sources (filter cake, sewage sludge), plus a control with 100% of the recommended fertilization via mineral fertilizer and no fertilization control (0%). Sugarcane was evaluated during two consecutive harvest, and the amount of stalks per hectare (ton ha-1), the sugarcane productivity (ton ha-1), the quantity of sugar per hectare (TSH, ton ha-1), and the chemical and technological analysis of the sugarcane juice: pol (%), brix (%), purity (%) and fiber (%) were evaluated. None of the organomineral sources or doses differed from the exclusive mineral fertilization. The analysis of both harvests indicated that the first cut was the most productive since the responses of the first harvest were superior or similar to the second harvest. The recommended organomineral dose to obtaining maximum quantitative and qualitative sugarcane results was between 102 and 109% of the regular recommendation for mineral fertilization, regardless of the organic source in the first sugarcane harvest. In the second sugarcane harvest, sewage sludge source increase by 4.68 and 4.19% the total amount of sugar per hectare and the quantity of sugarcane compared to the sugarcane filter cake source. Sewage sludge and sugarcane filter cake as sources for organominerals are viable alternatives and advantageous in economic and environmental terms for the cultivation of sugarcane.",

    "abstract": "Genetic networks that generate oscillations in gene expression activity are found in a wide range of organisms throughout all kingdoms of life. Oscillatory dynamics facilitates the temporal orchestration of metabolic and growth processes inside cells and organisms, as well as the synchronization of such processes with periodically occurring changes in the environment. Synthetic oscillator gene circuits such as the  repressilator can perform similar functions in bacteria. Until recently, such circuits were mainly based on a relatively small set of well-characterized transcriptional repressors and activators. A promising, sequence-programmable alternative for gene regulation is given by CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), which enables transcriptional repression of nearly arbitrary gene targets directed by short guide RNA molecules. In order to demonstrate the use of CRISPRi in the context of dynamic gene circuits, we here replaced one of the nodes of a repressilator circuit by the RNA-guided dCas9 protein. Using single cell experiments in microfluidic reactors we show that this system displays robust relaxation oscillations over multiple periods and over the time course of several days. Through statistical analysis of the single cell data, the potential for the circuit to act as a synthetic pacemaker for cellular processes is evaluated. The use of CRISPRi in the context of an oscillator circuit is found to have profound effects on its dynamics. Specifically, irreversible binding of dCas9-sgRNA appears to prolong the period of the oscillator. Further, we demonstrate that the oscillator affects cellular growth, leading to variations in growth rate with the oscillators frequency.",

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have aroused intense interest, since they have a broad spectrum of activity, and therefore, several systems for predicting antimicrobial peptides have been developed, using scalar physicochemical properties; however, regardless of the machine learning algorithm, these systems often fail in discriminating AMPs from their shuffled versions, leading to the need for new training methods to overcome this bias. Aiming to solve this bias, here we present \"Sense the Moment\", a prediction system capable of discriminating AMPs and shuffled versions.\n\nMethodsThe system was trained using 776 entries: 388 from known AMPs and another 388 based on shuffled versions of known AMPs. Each entry contained the geometric average of three hydrophobic moments measured with different scales.\n\nResultsThe model showed good accuracy (>80 %) and excellent sensitivity (>90 %) for AMP prediction, exceeding deep-learning-based methods.\n\nConclusionOur results demonstrate the systems applicability, aiding in identifying and discarding non-AMPs, since the number of false negatives is lower than false positives. General Significance: The application of this model in virtual screening protocols for identifying and/or creating antimicrobial agents could aid in the identification of potential drugs to control pathogenic microorganisms and in solving the antibiotic resistance crisis.\n\nAvailabilityThe system was implemented as a web application, available at <http://portoreports.com/stm/>.",

Investigating the mechanisms behind the survival of a newly formed allopolyploid highlighted the key role of DNA methylation. With the improvement of high-throughput methods, such as whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), an opportunity opened to further understand the role of DNA methylation at a larger scale and higher resolution. However, only a few studies have applied WGBS to allopolyploids, which might be due to lack of genomic resources combined with a burdensome data analysis process. To overcome these problems, we developed the Automated Reproducible Polyploid EpiGenetic GuIdance workflOw (ARPEGGIO): the first workflow for the analysis of epigenetic data in polyploids. This workflow analyzes WGBS data from allopolyploid species via the genome assemblies of the allopolyploids parent species. ARPEGGIO utilizes an updated read classification algorithm (EAGLE-RC), to tackle the challenge of sequence similarity amongst parental genomes. ARPEGGIO offers automation, but more importantly, a complete set of analyses including spot checks starting from raw WGBS data: quality checks, trimming, alignment, methylation extraction, statistical analyses and downstream analyses. A full run of ARPEGGIO outputs a list of genes showing differential methylation. ARPEGGIOs design focuses on ease of use and reproducibility. ARPEGGIO was made simple to set up, run and interpret, and its implementation includes both package management and containerization. Here we discuss all the steps, challenges and implementation strategies; example datasets are provided to show how to use ARPEGGIO. In addition, we also test EAGLE-RC with publicly available datasets given a ground truth, and we show that EAGLE-RC decreases the error rate by 3 to 4 times compared to standard approaches. The goal of ARPEGGIO is to promote, support and improve polyploid research with a reproducible and automated set of analyses in a convenient implementation.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent biosensors based on environment-sensitive dyes have important advantages over alternative methodologies such as FRET, including the potential for enhanced brightness, elimination of bleaching artifacts, and more possibilities for multiplexing. However, such biosensors have been difficult to use because they required proteins to be covalently labeled and reintroduced into cells. Recent development of self-labeling enzymes that covalently react with membrane-permeable dyes (e.g. SNAP-tag) provide an opportunity to easily generate dye-based biosensors within cells. Here, we generate a new biosensor for Cdc42 activation by positioning SNAP-tag between Cdc42 and a peptide that binds selectively to active Cdc42. We generate a membrane-permeable Nile Red derivative that exhibits 50-fold fluorescence enhancement upon covalent labeling of the biosensor, then optimize the biosensor so the dye undergoes a 20 nm emission shift upon Cdc42 activation, enabling ratiometric imaging with a single dye. The biosensor, named SNAPsense Cdc42, is validated by examining its response to known regulatory proteins and studying Cdc42 activation during protrusion in living cells. Variants using other dyes are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Artificial wildlife feeding might contribute to the successful establishment of some invasive alien species, like the Eastern grey squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis) in Europe and the UK. Reducing squirrel feeding at urban parks can be important to reduce squirrel populations while avoiding social conflicts. From April to October 2018, we conducted interviews and administered factorial surveys to two samples of visitors at the Valentino urban park in Torino (Italy). We established whether squirrel feeding can be regarded as an independent or an interdependent behavior, by eliciting visitors moral beliefs, and their empirical and normative expectations.\n\nMost respondents did not regard artificial feeding as something neither intrinsically positive nor negative. Satisfaction, the need for a connection with nature and the presence of children were its main causes. On the other hand, feeding squirrels was deemed to be potentially dangerous for squirrel health, and leading to high squirrel densities and to confident squirrels.\n\nFactorial surveys indicated that empirical expectations about the behavior of other visitors, altogether with their past behavior, lead visitors to feed squirrels, while the availability of suboptimal food types (e.g. sweets), was deemed to made people less prone to forage squirrels. Our findings indicate that supplementary feeding is an interdependent behavior, governed by descriptive norms. It might be reduced by means of informative panels containing descriptive information about the fact that most visitors indeed do not feed squirrels, as well as by panels emphasizing the potential damage that squirrels could suffer from eating suboptimal food provided by humans.",

    "abstract": "Host-microbe interactions are increasingly recognized as important drivers of organismal health, growth, longevity, and community-scale ecological processes. However, less is known about how genetic variation affects hosts associated microbiomes and downstream phenotypes. We demonstrate that sunflower (Helianthus annuus) harbors substantial, heritable variation in microbial communities under field conditions. We show that microbial communities explain up to 77.5% of the heritable variation in resistance to root infection caused by the necrotrophic pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and that plants grown in sterilized soil showed almost complete elimination of pathogen resistance. Association mapping revealed 69 genetic locations related to microbial abundance and Sclerotinia resistance. Although the genetic architecture is complex and quantitative, we have, in large part, elucidated previously unexplained genetic variation for resistance to this pathogen. This suggests new targets for plant breeding and demonstrates the potential for heritable microbial associations to play important roles in defense in natural and human-altered environments.",

    "abstract": "Among eight Arabidopsis CaM-Binding Protein (CBP) 60 family members, AtCBP60g and AtSARD1 are partially functionally redundant, major positive immune regulators while AtCBP60a is a negative immune regulator. Phylogenetic analysis of CBP60 protein sequences of 247 diverse land plant species indicated that the CBP60a, CBP60g, and SARD1 immune regulator subfamilies diversified around the time of Angiosperm divergence. The immune regulator subfamilies, especially the CBP60g subfamily, have been evolving very fast, suggesting strong selection pressure from CBP60-targeting pathogen effectors. We closely examined this fast evolution of the immune regulator subfamilies using the subfamily protein sequences from 12 diverse Core Eudicot species. The fast evolution was caused by both high proportions of polymorphic sites and high evolution rates per polymorphic site, compared to the genomic norm. We developed an analytical platform for physical-chemical characteristics of amino acids, called Protein Evolution Analysis in Euclidean Space (PEAES). Using the pairwise distance rank on PEAES (PEAES-PDR), we detected signatures of significant coevolutionary interactions across the immune regulator subfamilies within the CBP60-conserved domain. The patterns of detected coevolutionary interactions were consistent with hypothetical coevolutionary mechanisms that protect the positive immune regulator function from targeting by pathogen effectors. The coevolutionary interactions across the subfamilies were largely specific to each species lineage, suggesting that the coevolution occurred through species lineage-specific histories of variable pathogen pressure. Thus, fast coevolution of the subfamilies with overlapping or opposing functions appears crucial to maintain resilience of the CBP60 immune regulator module against fast-evolving pathogen effectors.",

Here, we describe a genome-wide RNA-interference library screen for cell cycle regulators in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei. We induced massive parallel knockdown and sorted the perturbed population into cell cycle stages using flow cytometry. RNAi-targets were deep-sequenced from each stage and cell cycle profiles were digitally reconstructed at a genomic scale. We identify hundreds of proteins that impact cell cycle progression; glycolytic enzymes required for G1S progression, DNA replication factors, mitosis regulators, proteasome and kinetochore complex components required for G2M progression, flagellar and cytoskeletal components required for cytokinesis, mRNA-binding factors, protein kinases and many previously uncharacterised proteins. The outputs facilitate functional annotation and drug-target prioritisation and provide comprehensive functional genomic evidence for the machineries, pathways and regulators that coordinate progression through the trypanosome cell cycle.\n\nThe data can be searched and browsed using an interactive, open access, online data visualization tool (https://tryp-cycle.onrender.com).",

    "abstract": "Seeds are reservoirs of beneficial and harmful microorganism that modulates plant growth and health. Here, we access seed to seedling bacteriome assembly modified by seed-disinfection and the underlined effect over maize germination performance and root-seedlings microbial colonization. Seed-disinfection was performed with sodium hypochlorite (1.25%, 30 min), resulting in a reduction of the cultivable-dependent fraction of seed-borne bacteria population, but not significantly detected by real-time PCR, microscopy, and biochemical analysis of the roots on germinated seeds. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the seed and root bacteriome exhibited similar diversity and did not differ in the structure concerning seed-disinfection. On the other hand, the abundance reduction of the genera f_Enterobacteriaceae_922761 (unassigned genus), Azospirillum, and Acinetobacter in disinfected-seed prior germination seems to display changes in prominence of several new taxa in the roots of germinated seeds. Interestingly, this reduction in the bacteriome negatively affected the germination speed and growth of maize plantlets. Additionally, bacteriome re-shape increased the maize var DKB 177 susceptible to the seed-borne plant pathogen Penicillium sp. Such changes in the natural seed-borne composition removed the natural barrier, increasing susceptibility to pathogens, impairing disinfected seeds to germinate, and develop. We conclude that bacteria borne in seeds modulate the relative abundance of taxa in the root, promote germination, seedling growth, and protect the maize against fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The cochlear implant is one of the most successful medical prostheses, allowing deaf and severely hearing-impaired persons to hear again by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. A trained audiologist adjusts the stimulation settings for good speech understanding, known as \"fitting\" the implant. This process is based on subjective feedback from the user, making it time-consuming and challenging, especially in paediatric or communication-impaired populations. Furthermore, fittings only happen during infrequent sessions at a clinic, and therefore cannot take into account variable factors that affect the users hearing, such as physiological changes and different listening environments. Objective audiometry, in which brain responses evoked by auditory stimulation are collected and analysed, removes the need for active patient participation. However, recording of brain responses still requires expensive equipment that is cumbersome to use. An elegant solution is to record the neural signals using the implant itself. We demonstrate for the first time the recording of continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) signals from the implanted intracochlear electrode array in human subjects, using auditory evoked potentials originating from different brain regions. Furthermore, we show that the response morphologies and amplitudes depend crucially on the recording electrode configuration. The integration of an EEG system into cochlear implants paves the way towards chronic neuro-monitoring of hearing-impaired patients in their everyday environment, and neuro-steered hearing prostheses, which can autonomously adjust their output based on neural feedback.",
