    "abstract": "ABSTRACTMajor intrinsic proteins (MIPs), commonly known as aquaporins, facilitate the membrane diffusion of water and some other non- polar solutes. MIPs might be involved in host-pathogen interactions. Herein, we identified 17, 24, 27, 19, 19, and 22 full-length MIPs, respectively, in the genomes of six Phytophthora species, P. infestans, P. parasitica, P. sojae, P. ramorum, P. capsici, and P. cinnamomi. These Phytophthora species are devastating plant pathogens and members of oomycetes, a distinct lineage of fungus-like eukaryotic microbes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Phytophthora MIPs (PMIPs) formed a completely distinct clade from their counterparts in other taxa and were clustered into nine subgroups. Sequence and structural properties indicated that the primary selectivity-related constrictions, including aromatic arginine (ar/R) selectivity filter and Froger\u2019s positions in PMIPs were distinct from those in other taxa. The substitutions in the conserved Asn-Pro-Ala motifs in loops B and E of many PMIPs were also divergent from those in plants. We further deciphered group-specific consensus sequences/motifs in different loops and transmembrane helices of PMIPs, which were distinct from those in plants, animals, and microbes. The data collectively supported the notion that PMIPs might have novel functions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Negotiating with others about how finite resources should be distributed is an important aspect of human social life. However, little is known about mechanisms underlying human social-interactive decision-making. Here, we report results from a novel iterative Ultimatum Game (UG) task, in which the proposers facial emotions and offer amounts were sampled probabilistically based on the participants decisions, creating a gradually evolving social-interactive decision-making environment. Our model-free results confirm the prediction that both the proposers facial emotions and the offer amount influence human choice behaviour. These main effects demonstrate that biases in facial emotion recognition also contribute to violations of the Rational Actor model (i.e. all offers should be accepted). Model-based analyses extend these findings, indicating that participants decisions are guided by an aversion to inequality in the UG. We highlight that the proposers facial responses to participant decisions dynamically modulate how human decision-makers perceive self-other inequality, relaxing its otherwise negative influence on decision values. In iterative games, this cognitive model underlies how offers initially rejected can gradually become more acceptable under increasing affective load, and accurately predicts 86% of participant decisions. Activity of the central arousal systems, assessed by measuring pupil size, encode a key element of this model: proposers affective reactions in response to participant decisions. Taken together, our results demonstrate that, under affective load, participants aversion to inequality is a malleable cognitive process which is modulated by the activity of the pupil-linked central arousal systems.",

    "abstract": "Whereas most people are biologically either male or female, their genetic interests are almost never aligned with just their own sex. Drawing on the evolutionary theory of inclusive fitness gained through relatives, we partition the effects of kin on fitness into those that derive from female versus male relatives. We argue that the balance of these female- and male-derived effects, which we call  Gendered Fitness Interests (GFI), might influence human behavior, especially the adoption of socio-political attitudes that have a gendered dimension. Our proposal builds on observations that individual socio-political views covary with the sex of their children or the numbers of relatives of each sex. Further, it is consistent with the relatively small average differences between womens and mens socio-political positions. We outline a method for partitioning GFI, and use simulation models to explore some of its properties. We then show that (1) the GFI component of womens and mens socio-political attitudes will converge, on average, with age. (2) The contributions of both descendent and non-descendent kin lead to considerable variation in GFI. (3) When men have longer average reproductive lifespans than women, GFI can show small male-biases. (4) Paternity uncertainty reduces the variation in GFI between individuals, and (5) Large family sizes are associated with more variation among individuals in GFI. Our proposal provides a framework for the study of the effects of kin on traits and attitudes with a gendered dimension. In this respect, it may prove generally useful in resolving the complex origins of gendered behavior.",

    "abstract": "Marine reserves are an essential component of modern fishery management. Marine reserves, which represent a management tradeoff between harvesting and conservation, are fundamental to maintenance of fisheries. Finding optimal reserve sizes that improve fishing yields is not only of theoretical interest, but also of practical importance to facilitate decision making. Also, since the migratory behavior of some species influences the spillover effect of a marine reserve, this is a key consideration when assessing performance of marine reserves. The relationship between optimal reserve size and migration rate/mode has not been well studied, but it is fundamental to management success. Here, I investigate optimal reserve size and its management outcome with different levels of spillover via a simple two-patch mathematical model. In this model, one patch is open to fishing, and the other is closed. The two-patch model is aggregated by single-population dynamics when the migration rate is sufficiently larger than the growth rate of a target species. At this limit, I show that an optimal reserve size exists when pre-reserve fishing occurs at fishing mortality larger than fMSY, the fishing mortality at the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). Also, the fishing yield at an optimal reserve size becomes as large as MSY at the limit. Numerical simulations at various migration rates between the two patches suggest that the maximum harvest under management with a marine reserve is achieved at this limit. This contrasts with the conservation benefit which is maximized at an intermediate migration rate. Numerical simulations show that the above-mentioned condition derived from the aggregated model is necessary when the migration rate is not sufficiently large, and that a moderate migration rate is further necessary for an optimal reserve size to exist. However, high fishing mortality reduces this requirement.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Human visual cortex contains many retinotopic and category-specific regions. These brain regions have been the focus of a large body of functional MRI research, significantly expanding our understanding of visual processing. As studying these regions requires accurate localization of their cortical location, researchers perform functional localizer scans to identify these regions in each individual. However, it not always possible to conduct these localizer scans. Here, we developed and validated a functional region of interest atlas of early visual and category-selective regions in human ventral and lateral occipito-temporal cortex. Results show that for the majority of fROIs, cortex-based alignment results in lower between-subject variability compared to nonlinear volumetric alignment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that (1) the atlas accurately predicts the location of an independent dataset of ventral temporal cortex ROIs and other atlases of place-selectivity, motion-selectivity, and retinotopy. Next, (2) we show that the majority of voxel within our atlas are responding mostly to the labelled category in a left-out subject cross-validation, demonstrating the utility of this atlas. The functional atlas is publicly available (download.brainvoyager.com/data/visfAtlas.zip) and can help identify the location of these regions in healthy subjects as well as populations (e.g. blind people, infants) in which functional localizers cannot be run.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has been called the \"signature injury\" of military Servicemembers in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and is highly comorbid with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Correct attribution of adverse blast-induced mTBI and/or PTSD remains challenging. Preclinical research using animal models can provide important insight into the mechanisms by which blast produces injury and dysfunction--but only to the degree by which such models reflect the human experience. Avoidance of trauma reminders is a hallmark of PTSD, here we sought to understand whether a mouse model of blast reproduces this phenomenon, in addition to blast-induced physical injuries. Drawing upon well-established work from the chronic stress and Pavlovian conditioning literature, we hypothesized that, even while anesthetized during blast exposure, environmental cues encountered in the peri-blast environment could be conditioned to evoke aversion/dysphoria and reexperiencing of traumatic stress. Using a pneumatic shock tube that recapitulates battlefield-relevant open-field blast forces, we provide direct evidence that stress is inherent to repetitive blast exposure, resulting in chronic aversive/dysphoric-like responses to previous blast-paired cues. The results in this report demonstrate that, while both single and repetitive blast exposures produce acute stress responses (weight loss, corticosterone increase), only repetitive blast exposure also results in co-occurring aversive/dysphoric-like stress responses. These results extend appreciation of the highly complex nature of repetitive blast exposure; and lend further support for the potential translational relevance of animal modeling approaches currently used by multiple laboratories aimed at elucidating the mechanisms (both molecular and behavioral) of repetitive blast exposure.",

    "abstract": "The AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) is a major energy sensor metabolic enzyme that is activated early during T cell immune responses but its role in the generation of effector T cells is still controversial.Using both in vitro and in vivo models of T cell proliferation, we show herein that AMPK is dispensable for early TCR signaling and short-term proliferation but required for sustained long-term T cell proliferation and effector / memory T cell survival. In particular, AMPK promoted accumulation of effector / memory T cells in competitive homeostatic proliferation settings. Transplantation of AMPK-deficient hematopo\u00efetic cells into allogeneic host recipients led to a reduced graft-versus-host disease, further bolstering a role for AMPK in the expansion and pathogenicity of effector T cells.Mechanistically, AMPK expression enhances the mitochondrial membrane potential of T cells, limits reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and resolves ROS-mediated toxicity. Moreover, dampening ROS production alleviates the proliferative defect of AMPK-deficient T cells, therefore indicating a role for an AMPK-mediated ROS control of T cell fitness.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Background DYT1 dystonia is a neurological movement disorder characterized by painful sustained muscle contractions resulting in abnormal twisting and postures. In a subset of patients, it is caused by a loss-of-function mutation (\u0394E302/303; or \u0394E) in the luminal ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA+) protein torsinA encoded by the TOR1A gene. The low penetrance of the \u0394E mutation (\u223c30-40%) suggests the existence of unknown genetic modifiers of DYT1 dystonia.Methods To identify these modifiers, we performed whole exome sequencing of blood leukocyte DNA isolated from two DYT1 dystonia patients, three asymptomatic carriers of the \u0394E mutation, and an unaffected adult relative.Results A total of 264 DYT1 dystonia-associated variants (DYT1 variants) were identified in 195 genes. Consistent with the emerging view of torsinA as an important regulator of the cytoskeleton, endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis, and lipid metabolism, we found DYT1 variants in genes that encode proteins implicated in these processes. Moreover, 40 DYT1 variants were detected in 32 genes associated with neuromuscular and neuropsychiatric disorders.Conclusion The DYT1 variants described in this work represent exciting new targets for future studies designed to increase our understanding of the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of DYT1 dystonia.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The cell-free DNA (cfDNA) methylation profile in liquid biopsies has been utilized to diagnose early-stage disease and estimate therapy response. However, in typical clinical settings, only very small amounts of cfDNA can be purified. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) is the gold standard to measure DNA methylation; however, WGBS using small amounts of fragmented DNA introduces a critical challenge for data analysis, namely a low mapping ratio. This, in turn, generates low sequencing depth and low coverage for CpG sites genome wide. The lack of informative CpGs has become a bottleneck for the clinical application of cfDNA-based WGBS assays. Hence, we developed LiBis (Low-input Bisulfite Sequencing), a novel method for low-input WGBS data alignment. By dynamically clipping initially unmapped reads and remapping clipped fragments, we judiciously rescued those reads and uniquely aligned them to the genome. By substantially increasing the mapping ratio by up to 88%, LiBis dramatically improved the number of informative CpGs and the precision in quantifying the methylation status of individual CpG sites. The high sensitivity and cost effectiveness afforded by LiBis for low-input samples will allow the discovery of genetic and epigenetic features suitable for downstream analysis and biomarker identification using liquid biopsy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.List of AbbreviationsLiBislow-input bisulfite sequencing alignmentcfDNAcell-free DNAWGBSwhole-genome bisulfite sequencingCpGcytosine nucleotide followed by a guanine nucleotidectDNAcirculating tumor DNAHTMLHyperText Markup LanguageHPVHuman papillomavirusView Full Text",

    "abstract": "Background The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus started in China in December 2019 and has since spread globally. Information about the spread of the virus in a country can inform the gradual reopening of a country and help to avoid a second wave of infections. Denmark is currently opening up after a lockdown in mid-March.Methods We perform a phylogenetic analysis of 742 publicly available Danish SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences and put them into context using sequences from other countries.Result Our findings are consistent with several introductions of the virus to Denmark from independent sources. We identify several chains of mutations that occurred in Denmark and in at least one case find evidence that the virus spread from Denmark to other countries. A number of the mutations found in Denmark are non-synonymous, and in general there is a considerable variety of strains. The proportions of the most common haplotypes is stable after lockdown.Conclusion Our work shows how genetic data can be used to identify routes of introduction of a virus into a region and provide alternative means for verifying existing assumptions. For example, our analysis supports the hypothesis that the virus was brought to Denmark by skiers returning from Ischgl. On the other hand, we identify transmission chains suggesting that Denmark was part of a network of countries among which the virus was being transmitted; thus challenging the common narrative that Denmark only got infected from abroad. Our analysis does not indicate that the major haplotypes appearing in Denmark have a different degree of virality. Our methods can be applied to other countries, regions or even highly localised outbreaks. When used in real-time, we believe they can serve to identify transmission events and supplement traditional methods such as contact tracing.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Rapid and cost-efficient whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is critical for understanding viral transmission dynamics. Here we show that using a new multiplexed set of primers in conjunction with the Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcode library kit allows for faster, simpler, and less expensive SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing. This primer set results in amplicons that exhibit lower levels of variation in coverage compared to other commonly used primer sets. Using five SARS-CoV-2 patient samples with Cq values between 20 and 31, we show that high-quality genomes can be generated with as few as 10,000 reads (approximately 5 Mbp of sequence data). We also show that mis-classification of barcodes, which may be more likely when using the Oxford Nanopore Rapid Barcode library prep, is unlikely to cause problems in variant calling. This method reduces the time from RNA to genome sequence by more than half compared to the more standard ligation-based Oxford Nanopore library preparation method at considerably lower costs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Statistical phylogenetic analysis currently relies on complex, dedicated software packages, making it difficult for evolutionary biologists to explore new models and inference strategies. Recent years have seen more generic solutions based on probabilistic graphical models, but this formalism can only partly express phylogenetic problems. Here we show that universal probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) solve the expressivity problem, while still supporting automated generation of efficient inference algorithms. To prove the latter point, we develop automated generation of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms for PPL descriptions of arbitrary biological diversification (birth-death) models. SMC is a new inference strategy for these problems, supporting both parameter inference and efficient estimation of Bayes factors that are used in model testing. We take advantage of this in automatically generating SMC algorithms for several recent diversification models that have been difficult or impossible to tackle previously. Finally, applying these algorithms to 40 bird phylogenies, we show that models with slowing diversification, constant turnover and many small shifts generally explain the data best. Our work opens up several related problem domains to PPL approaches, and shows that few hurdles remain before these techniques can be effectively applied to the full range of phylogenetic models.",

    "abstract": "Brassica napus is an important oilseed crop cultivated worldwide. During domestication and breeding of B. napus, flowering time has been a target of selection because of its substantial impact on yield. Here we use double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD) to investigate the genetic basis of flowering in B. napus. An F2 mapping population was derived from a cross between an early-flowering spring type and a late-flowering winter type. Flowering time in the mapping population differed by up to 25 days between individuals. High genotype error rates persisted after initial quality controls, as suggested by a genotype discordance of \u223c12% between biological sequencing replicates. After genotype error correction, a linkage map spanning 3,605.70 cM and compromising 14,630 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was constructed. A quantitative trail locus (QTL) on chromosome C2 was detected in the vicinity of flowering time genes including FT and FLC. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the ddRAD approach to sample the B. napus genome. Our results also suggest that ddRAD genotype error rates can be higher than expected in F2 populations. Quality filtering and genotype correction and imputation can substantially reduce these error rates and allow effective linkage mapping and QTL analysis.Competing Interest StatementBASF supported this work and employs SR.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Corals are colonized by symbiotic microorganisms that exert a profound influence on the animals health. One noted symbiont is a single-celled alga (from the family Symbiodiniaceae), which provides the coral with most of its fixed carbon. During thermal stress, hyperactivity of photosynthesis results in a toxic accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). If not scavenged by the antioxidant network, ROS may trigger a signaling cascade ending with the coral host and algal symbiont disassociating; this process is known as bleaching. Our goal was to construct a probiotic comprised of host-associated bacteria able to neutralize free radicals such as ROS. Using the coral model, the anemone Exaiptasia diaphana, and pure bacterial cultures isolated from the model animal, we identified six strains with high free radical scavenging ability belonging to the families Alteromonadaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Micrococcaceae. In parallel, we established a \"negative\" probiotic consisting of genetically related strains with poor free radical scavenging capacities. From their whole genome sequences, we explored genes of interest that may contribute to their potential beneficial roles, which may help facilitate the therapeutic application of a bacterial probiotic. In particular, the occurrence of key pathways that are known to influence ROS in each of the strains has been inferred from the genomes sequences and are reported here.\n\nIMPORTANCECoral bleaching is tightly linked to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which accumulates to a toxic level in algae-harboring host cells leading to coral-algal dissociation. Interventions targeting ROS accumulation, such as the application of exogenous antioxidants, have shown promise for maintaining the coral-algal partnership. With the feasibility of administering antioxidants directly to corals being low, we aim to develop a probiotic to neutralize toxic ROS during a thermal stress event. This probiotic can be tested with corals or a coral model to assess its efficacy in improving coral resistance to environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAntimicrobial resistant (AMR) Neisseria gonorrhoeae is an urgent threat to public health, as strains resistant to at least one of the two last line antibiotics used in empiric therapy of gonorrhoea, ceftriaxone and azithromycin, have spread internationally. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) data can be used to identify new AMR clones, transmission networks and inform the development of point-of-care tests for antimicrobial susceptibility, novel antimicrobials and vaccines. Community driven tools that provide an easy access to and analysis of genomic and epidemiological data is the way forward for public health surveillance.\n\nMethodsHere we present a public health focussed scheme for genomic epidemiology of N. gonorrhoeae at Pathogenwatch (https://pathogen.watch/ngonorrhoeae). An international advisory group of experts in epidemiology, public health, genetics and genomics of N. gonorrhoeae was convened to inform on the utility of current and future analytics in the platform. We implement backwards compatibility with MLST, NG-MAST and NG-STAR typing schemes as well as an exhaustive library of genetic AMR determinants linked to a genotypic prediction of resistance to eight antibiotics. A collection of over 12,000 N. gonorrhoeae genome sequences from public archives has been quality-checked, assembled and made public together with available metadata for contextualization.\n\nResultsAMR prediction from genome data revealed specificity values over 99% for azithromycin, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone and sensitivity values around 99% for benzylpenicillin and tetracycline. A case study using the Pathogenwatch collection of N. gonorrhoeae public genomes showed the global expansion of an azithromycin resistant lineage carrying a mosaic mtr over at least the last 10 years, emphasizing the power of Pathogenwatch to explore and evaluate genomic epidemiology questions of public health concern.\n\nConclusionsThe N. gonorrhoeae scheme in Pathogenwatch provides customized bioinformatic pipelines guided by expert opinion that can be adapted to public health agencies and departments with little expertise in bioinformatics and lower resourced settings with internet connection but limited computational infrastructure. The advisory group will assess and identify ongoing public health needs in the field of gonorrhoea, particularly regarding gonococcal AMR, in order to further enhance utility with modified or new analytic methods.",

    "abstract": "Maternal tobacco smoking during pregnancy is a large driver of health inequalities and a higher prevalence of conduct problem has been observed in exposed offspring. Further, maternal tobacco use during pregnancy can also alter offspring DNA methylation. However, currently, limited molecular evidence have been found to support this observation. Thus we aim to examine the association between maternal tobacco use in pregnancy and whether offspring Conduct problems is mediated by tobacco exposure-induced via DNA methylation differences. Understanding the etiology of the causal link will be crucial in the early identification and treatment of CP in children and adolescents. DNA was sourced from the Christchurch Health and Development Study, a longitudinal birth cohort studied for over 40 years in New Zealand. Bisulfite-based amplicon sequencing of 10 loci known to play a role in neurodevelopment, or with associations with CP phenotypes, was undertaken. We identified nominally significant differential DNA methylation at specific CpG sites in CYP1A1, ASH2L and MEF2C in individuals with Conduct problems who were exposed to tobacco in utero. We conclude that environmentally-induced DNA methylation differences could play a role in the observed link between maternal tobacco use during pregnancy and childhood/adolescent Conduct problems However, larger sample sizes are needed to produce an adequate amount of power to investigate this interaction further.",

RTs should possess elevated temperature optimum, high thermal stability, processivity, and tolerance to contaminants originating from the biological substances under analysis or the purification reagents. Here, we have constructed a set of chimeric RTs, based on the combination of MuLV-RT and DNA-binding domains: the DNA-binding domain of DNA ligase Pyrococcus abyssi and Sto7d protein, Sso7d counterpart, from Sulfolobus tokodaii. Chimeric RTs showed the same optimal temperature and the efficacy of terminal transferase reaction as the original M-MuLV RT. Processivity and the efficiency in cDNA synthesis of the chimeric RT with Sto7d at C-end were increased several-fold. The attachment of Sto7d enhanced the M-MuLV RT tolerance to the most common amplification inhibitors: NaCl, urea, guanidinium chloride, formamide, components of human whole blood, and human blood plasma. Thus, fusing M-MuLV RT with an additional domain resulted in more robust and efficient RTs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTGenotype imputation is a fundamental step in genomic data analysis such as GWAS, where missing variant genotypes are predicted using the existing genotypes of nearby \u2018tag\u2019 variants. Imputation greatly decreases the genotyping cost and provides high-quality estimates of common variant genotypes. As population panels increase, e.g., the TOPMED Project, genotype imputation is becoming more accurate, but it requires high computational power. Although researchers can outsource genotype imputation, privacy concerns may prohibit genetic data sharing with an untrusted imputation service. To address this problem, we developed the first fully secure genotype imputation by utilizing ultra-fast homomorphic encryption (HE) techniques that can evaluate millions of imputation models in seconds. In HE-based methods, the genotype data is end-to-end encrypted, i.e., encrypted in transit, at rest, and, most importantly, in analysis, and can be decrypted only by the data owner. We compared secure imputation with three other state-of-the-art non-secure methods under different settings. We found that HE-based methods provide full genetic data security with comparable or slightly lower accuracy. In addition, HE-based methods have time and memory requirements that are comparable and even lower than the non-secure methods. We provide five different implementations and workflows that make use of three cutting-edge HE schemes (BFV, CKKS, TFHE) developed by the top contestants of the iDASH19 Genome Privacy Challenge. Our results provide strong evidence that HE-based methods can practically perform resource-intensive computations for high throughput genetic data analysis. In addition, the publicly available codebases provide a reference for the development of secure genomic data analysis methods.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Mechanobiological coupling is introduced at the cell level in a discrete modelling framework, and new reaction-diffusion equations are derived to describe tissue-level outcomes. The free boundary evolves as a result of the underlying biological mechanisms included in the discrete model. To demonstrate the accuracy of the continuum model, we compare numerical solutions of the discrete and continuum models for two different signalling pathways. First, we study the Rac-Rho pathway where cell- and tissue-level mechanics are directly related to intracellular signalling. Second, we study an activator-inhibitor system which gives rise to spatial and temporal patterning related to Turing patterns. In all cases, the continuum model and free boundary condition accurately reflect the cell-level processes included in the discrete model.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-specific transcription factors are frequently inactivated in cancer. To fully dissect the heterogeneity of such tumor suppressor events requires single-cell resolution, yet this is challenging because of the high dropout rate. Here we propose a simple yet effective computational strategy called SCIRA to infer regulatory activity of tissue-specific transcription factors at single-cell resolution and use this tool to identify tumor suppressor events in single-cell RNA-Seq cancer studies. We demonstrate that tissue-specific transcription factors are preferentially inactivated in the corresponding cancer cells, suggesting that these are driver events. For many known or suspected tumor suppressors, SCIRA predicts inactivation in single cancer cells where differential expression does not, indicating that SCIRA improves the sensitivity to detect changes in regulatory activity. We identify NKX2-1 and TBX4 inactivation as early tumor suppressor events in normal non-ciliated lung epithelial cells from smokers. In summary, SCIRA can help chart the heterogeneity of tumor suppressor events at single-cell resolution.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Sensitivity to satiety constitutes a basic requirement for neuronal coding of subjective reward value. Satiety from natural on-going consumption affects reward functions in learning and approach behavior. More specifically, satiety reduces the subjective economic value of individual rewards during choice between options that typically contain multiple reward components. The unconfounded assessment of economic reward value requires tests at choice indifference between two options, which is difficult to achieve with sated rewards. By conceptualizing choices between options with multiple reward components ( bundles), Revealed Preference Theory may offer a solution. Despite satiety, choices against an unaltered reference bundle may remain indifferent when the reduced value of a sated bundle reward is compensated by larger amounts of an unsated reward of the same bundle; then the value loss of the sated reward is indicated by the amount of the added unsated reward. Here we show psychophysically titrated choice indifference in monkeys between bundles of differently sated rewards. Neuronal chosen value signals in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) followed closely the subjective value change within recording periods of individual neurons. A neuronal classifier distinguishing the bundles and predicting choice substantiated the subjective value change. Choice between conventional single rewards confirmed the neuronal changes seen with two-reward bundles. Thus, reward-specific satiety reduces subjective reward value signals in OFC. With satiety being an important factor of subjective reward value, these results extend the notion of subjective economic reward value coding in OFC neurons.\n\nSignificanceOn-going consumption reduces the subjective value of rewards to different degrees depending on their individual properties, a phenomenon referred to as sensory-specific satiety. Such value change should be manifested in economic choices, and neuronal signals for subjective economic reward value should be sensitive to reward-specific satiety. We tested monkeys during choice between two options that each contained two different rewards ( bundles); the two rewards were prone to different degrees of satiety. On-going reward consumption affected choices in a way that indicated satiety-induced reward-specific change of subjective economic value. Neuronal responses in the monkey orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) followed the differential reduction of subjective economic value. These results satisfy a crucial requirement for subjective reward value coding in OFC neurons.",

    "abstract": "Useful memory must balance between stability and malleability. This puts effective memory storage at odds with plasticity processes like reconsolidation. What becomes of memory maintenance processes during synaptic plasticity is unknown. Here we examined the fate of the memory maintenance protein PKM{zeta} during memory destabilization and reconsolidation. We found that NMDA receptor activation and proteasome activity induced a transient reduction in PKM{zeta} protein following retrieval. During reconsolidation, new PKM{zeta} was synthesized to re-store the memory. Failure to synthesize new PKM{zeta} during reconsolidation impaired memory but uninterrupted PKM{zeta} translation was not necessary for maintenance itself. Finally, NMDA receptor activation was necessary to render memories vulnerable to the amnesic effect of PKM{zeta}-antisense. These findings outline a transient collapse and renewal of the PKM{zeta} memory maintenance mechanism during plasticity. We argue that dynamic changes in PKM{zeta} protein levels can serve as an exemplary model of the molecular changes underlying memory destabilization and reconsolidation.",

    "abstract": "Current analyses of metacommunity data largely focus on global attributes across the entire metacommunity, such as mean alpha, beta, and gamma diversity, as well as the partitioning of compositional variation into single estimates of contributions of space and environmental effects and, more recently, possible contributions of species interactions. However, this view neglects the fact that different species and sites in the landscape can vary widely in how they contribute to these metacommunity-wide attributes. We argue for a new conceptual framework with matched analytics with the goals of studying the complex and interactive relations between process and pattern in metacommunities that is focused on the variation among species and among sites which we call the  internal structure of the metacommunity. To demonstrate how the internal structure could be studied, we create synthetic data using a process-based colonization-extinction metacommunity model. We then use Joint Species Distribution Models to estimate how the contributions of space, environment and biotic interactions driving metacommunity assembly differ among species and sites. We find that this approach to the internal structure of metacommunities provides useful information about the distinct ways that different species and different sites contribute to metacommunity structure. Although it has limitations, our work points at a more general approach to understand how other possible complexities might affect internal structure and might thus be incorporated into a more cohesive metacommunity theory.",

Transcription factors Hnf4 (MODY1) and FoxO1 are respective examples of these two components, and are known to act through {beta}-cell-specific enhancers. However, their relationship is unclear. Here we show by genome-wide interrogation of chromatin modifications that FoxO1 ablation in mature {beta}-cells leads to increased selection of FoxO1 enhancers by Hnf4. To model the functional significance we generated single and compound knockouts of FoxO1 and Hnf4 in {beta}-cells. Single knockout of either gene impaired insulin secretion in mechanistically distinct fashions. Surprisingly, the defective {beta}-cell secretory function of either single mutant in hyperglycemic clamps and isolated islets treated with various secretagogues, was completely reversed in double mutants. Gene expression analyses revealed the reversal of {beta}-cell dysfunction with an antagonistic network regulating glycolysis, including {beta}-cell \"disallowed\" genes; and that a synergistic network regulating protocadherins emerged as likely mediators of the functional restoration of insulin secretion. The findings provide evidence of antagonistic epistasis as a model of gene/environment interactions in the pathogenesis of {beta}-cell dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Strictly controlled inducible gene expression is crucial when engineering biological systems where even tiny amounts of a protein have a large impact on function or host cell viability. In these cases, leaky protein production must be avoided at all costs, but ideally without affecting the achievable range of expression. Here, we demonstrate how the central dogma offers a simple way to effectively address this challenge. By simultaneously regulating both transcription and translation, we show how relative basal expression of an inducible system can be greatly reduced, with minimal impact on the maximum induced expression rate. Using this approach, we create several stringent expression systems displaying >1000-fold change in their output after induction in vivo and up to a 350-fold change when used in a cell-free expression system. Furthermore, we find that multi-level regulation is able to suppress transcriptional noise and creates a digital-like switch when transitioning between  on and  off states. This work provides foundational knowledge and a genetic toolkit of parts to create multi-level gene expression controllers for those working with toxic genes or requiring precise regulation and propagation of cellular signals. It also demonstrates the value of exploring more complex and diverse regulatory designs for synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Flexible behavior requires switching between different task conditions. It is known that such task- switching is associated with costs in terms of slowed reaction time, reduced accuracy, or both. The neural correlates of task-switching have usually been studied by requiring participants to switch between distinct task demands that recruit different brain networks. Here, we investigated the transition of neural states underlying switching between two opposite memory-related processes (i.e., memory retrieval and memory suppression) in a memory task. We investigated 26 healthy participants who performed a Think/No-Think task while being in the fMRI scanner. Behaviorally, we show that it was more difficult for participants to suppress unwanted memories when a No-Think was preceded by a Think trial instead of another No- Think trial. Neurally, we demonstrate that Think-to-No-Think switches were associated with an increase in control-related and a decrease in memory-related brain activity. Neural representations of task demand, assessed by decoding accuracy, were lower immediately after task switching compared to the non-switch transitions, suggesting a switch-induced delay in the neural transition towards the required task condition. This suggestion is corroborated by an association between condition-specific representational strength and condition-specific performance in switch trials. Taken together, we provided neural evidence from the time-resolved decoding approach to support the notion that carry-over of the previous task-set activation is associated with the switching cost leading to less successful memory suppression.\n\nSignificance statementOur brain can switch between multiple tasks but at the cost of less optimal performance during transition. One possible neuroscientific explanation is that the representation of the task condition is not easy to be updated immediately after switching. Thus, weak representations for the task at hand explain performance costs. To test this, we applied brain decoding approaches to human fMRI data when participants switched between successive trials of memory retrieval and suppression. We found that switching leads to a weaker representation of the current task. The remaining representation of the previous, opposite task is associated with inferior performance in the current task. Therefore, timely updating of task representations is critical for task switching in the service of flexible behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is under homeostatic control, whereby increasing wakefulness generates sleep need and triggers sleep drive. However, the molecular and cellular pathways by which sleep need is encoded are poorly understood. In addition, the mechanisms underlying both how and when sleep need is transformed to sleep drive are unknown. Here, using ex vivo and in vivo imaging, we show in Drosophila that astroglial Ca2+ signaling increases with sleep need. We demonstrate that this signaling is dependent on a specific L-type Ca2+ channel and is required for homeostatic sleep rebound. Thermogenetically increasing Ca2+ in astrocytes induces persistent sleep behavior, and we exploit this phenotype to conduct a genetic screen for genes required for the homeostatic regulation of sleep. From this large-scale screen, we identify TyrRII, a monoaminergic receptor required in astrocytes for sleep homeostasis. TyrRII levels rise following sleep deprivation in a Ca2+-dependent manner, promoting further increases in astrocytic Ca2+ and resulting in a positive-feedback loop. These data suggest that TyrRII acts as a gate to enable the transformation of sleep need to sleep drive at the appropriate time. Moreover, our findings suggest that astrocytes then transmit this sleep need to the R5 sleep drive circuit, by upregulation and release of the interleukin-1 analog Spatzle. These findings define astroglial Ca2+ signaling mechanisms encoding sleep need and reveal dynamic properties of the sleep homeostatic control system.",

While alarming effects on wildlife have been documented, we have limited understanding of the perceptual mechanisms of noise disturbance, which are required to understand potential mitigation measures. Likewise, individual differences in response to noise (especially via perceptual mechanisms) are likely widespread, but lacking in empirical data. Here we use echolocating bats, a trained discrimination task, and experimental noise playback to explicitly test perceptual mechanisms of noise disturbance. We demonstrate high individual variability in response to noise treatments and evidence for multiple perceptual mechanisms. Additionally, we highlight that only some individuals are able to cope with noise, while others are not. We tested for changes in echolocation call duration, amplitude, and peak frequency as possible ways of coping with noise. Although all bats strongly increased call amplitude and showed additional minor changes in call duration and frequency, these changes cannot explain the differences in coping and non-coping individuals. Our understanding of noise disturbance needs to become more mechanistic and individualistic as research knowledge is transformed into policy changes and conservation action.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic is the most important public health threat in recent history. Here we study how its causal agent, SARS-CoV-2, has diversified genetically since its first emergence in December 2019. We have created a pipeline combining both phylogenetic and structural analysis to identify possible human-adaptation related mutations in a data set consisting of 4,894 SARS-CoV-2 complete genome sequences. Although the phylogenetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 is low, the whole genome phylogenetic tree can be divided into five clusters/clades based on the tree topology and clustering of specific mutations, but its branches exhibit low genetic distance and bootstrap support values. We also identified 11 residues that are high-frequency substitutions, with four of them currently showing some signal for potential positive selection. These fast-evolving sites are in the non-structural proteins nsp2, nsp5 (3CL-protease), nsp6, nsp12 (polymerase) and nsp13 (helicase), in accessory proteins (ORF3a, ORF8) and in the structural proteins N and S. Temporal and spatial analysis of these potentially adaptive mutations revealed that the incidence of some of these sites was declining after having reached an (often local) peak, whereas the frequency of other sites is continually increasing and now exhibit a worldwide distribution. Structural analysis revealed that the mutations are located on the surface of the proteins that modulate biochemical properties. We speculate that this improves binding to cellular proteins and hence represents fine-tuning of adaptation to human cells. Our study has implications for the design of biochemical and clinical experiments to assess whether important properties of SARS-CoV-2 have changed during the epidemic.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The high mutation rate in retroviruses is one of the leading causes of drug resistance. In human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), synergistic mutations in its protease and the protease substrate - the Group-specific antigen (Gag) polyprotein - work together to confer drug resistance against protease inhibitors and compensate the mutations affecting viral fitness. Some Gag mutations can restore Gag-protease binding, yet most Gag-protease correlated mutations occur outside of the Gag cleavage site. To investigate the molecular basis for this, we now report multiscale modelling approaches to investigate various sequentially cleaved Gag products in the context of clinically relevant mutations that occur outside of the cleavage sites, including simulations of the largest Gag proteolytic product in its viral membrane-bound state. We found that some mutations, such as G123E and H219Q, involve direct interaction with cleavage site residues to influence their local environment, while certain mutations in the matrix domain lead to the enrichment of lipids important for Gag targeting and assembly. Collectively, our results reveal why non-cleavage site mutations have far-reaching implications outside of Gag proteolysis, with important consequences for drugging Gag maturation intermediates and tackling protease inhibitor resistance.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTWith its ability to catabolize a wide variety of carbon sources and a growing engineering toolkit, Pseudomonas putida KT2440 is emerging as an important chassis organism for metabolic engineering. Despite advances in our understanding of this organism, many gaps remain in our knowledge of the genetic basis of its metabolic capabilities. These gaps are particularly noticeable in our understanding of both fatty acid and alcohol catabolism, where many paralogs putatively coding for similar enzymes co-exist making biochemical assignment via sequence homology difficult. To rapidly assign function to the enzymes responsible for these metabolisms, we leveraged Random Barcode Transposon Sequencing (RB-TnSeq). Global fitness analyses of transposon libraries grown on 13 fatty acids and 10 alcohols produced strong phenotypes for hundreds of genes. Fitness data from mutant pools grown on varying chain length fatty acids indicated specific enzyme substrate preferences, and enabled us to hypothesize that DUF1302/DUF1329 family proteins potentially function as esterases. From the data we also postulate catabolic routes for the two biogasoline molecules isoprenol and isopentanol, which are catabolized via leucine metabolism after initial oxidation and activation with CoA. Because fatty acids and alcohols may serve as both feedstocks or final products of metabolic engineering efforts, the fitness data presented here will help guide future genomic modifications towards higher titers, rates, and yields.IMPORTANCE To engineer novel metabolic pathways into P. putida, a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of its versatile metabolism is essential. Here we provide functional evidence for the putative roles of hundreds of genes involved in the fatty acid and alcohol metabolism of this bacterium. These data provide a framework facilitating precise genetic changes to prevent product degradation and channel the flux of specific pathway intermediates as desired.Competing Interest StatementJ.D.K. has financial interests in Amyris, Lygos, Demetrix, Napigen, Maple Bio, and Apertor Labs.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWCues involved in mate seeking and recognition prevent hybridization and can be involved in speciation processes. In malaria mosquitoes, females of the two sibling species Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. coluzzii mate in monospecific male swarms and hybrids are rare. Long-range sex pheromones driving this behavior have been debated in literature but to date, no study has proven their existence or their absence. Here, we attempted to bring to light their existence. To put all the odds in our favor, we used different chemical ecology methods such as behavioral and electrophysiological assays as well chemical analyses, and we worked with mosquitoes at their optimal physiological mating state i.e. with swarming males during their natural swarming windows. Despite all our efforts, our results support the absence of long-range sex pheromones involved in swarm detection and recognition by females. We briefly discuss the implications of this finding in ecology, evolution and for control strategies.",

    "abstract": "Variants in the LIM homeobox transcription factor 1-beta gene (LMX1B) predispose individuals to elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), a key risk factor for glaucoma. However, the effect of LMX1B mutations varies widely between individuals. To better understand mechanisms underlying LMX1B-related phenotypes and individual differences, we backcrossed the Lmx1bV265D (also known as Lmx1bIcst) allele onto the C57BL/6J (B6), 129/Sj (129), C3A/BLiA-Pde6b+/J (C3H), and DBA/2J-Gpnmb+ (D2-G) strain backgrounds. Strain background had a significant effect on the onset and severity of ocular phenotypes in Lmx1bV265D/+ mutant mice. Mice of the B6 background were the most susceptible to developing elevated IOP, severe anterior segment developmental anomalies (including malformed eccentric pupils, iridocorneal strands, and corneal abnormalities) and glaucomatous nerve damage. In contrast, Lmx1bV265D mice of the 129 background were the most resistant to developing anterior segment abnormalities, had less severe IOP elevation than B6 mutants at young ages, and showed no detectable nerve damage. To identify genetic modifiers of susceptibility to Lmx1bV265D-induced glaucoma-associated phenotypes, we performed a mapping cross between mice of the B6 (susceptible) and 129 (resistant) backgrounds. We identified a modifier locus on Chromosome 18, with the 129 allele(s) substantially lessening severity of ocular phenotypes, as confirmed by congenic analysis. By demonstrating a clear effect of genetic background in modulating Lmx1b-induced phenotypes, by providing a panel of strains with different phenotypic severities and by identifying a modifier locus, this study lays a foundation for better understanding the roles of LMX1B in glaucoma with the goal of developing new treatments.",

    "abstract": "Torsin ATPases of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and nuclear envelope (NE) lumen inhibit Lipin-mediated phosphatidate (PA) to diacylglycerol (DAG) conversion by an unknown mechanism. This excess PA metabolism is implicated in TOR1A/TorsinA diseases, but it is unclear whether it explains why Torsin concomitantly affects nuclear structure, lipid droplets (LD), organelle and cell growth. Here a fly miniscreen identified that Torsins affect these events via the NEP1R1-CTDNEP1 phosphatase complex. Further, Torsin homo-oligomerization rather than ATPase activity was key to function. NEP1R1-CTDNEP1 activates Lipin by dephosphorylation. We show that Torsin prevents CTDNEP1 from accumulating in the NE and excludes Lipin from the nucleus. Moreover, this repression of nuclear PA metabolism is required for interphase nuclear pore biogenesis. We conclude that Torsin is an upstream regulator of the NEP1R1-CTDNEP1/ Lipin pathway. This connects the ER/NE lumen with PA metabolism, and affects numerous cellular events including it has a previously unrecognized role in nuclear pore biogenesis.HighlightsNuclear envelope PA-DAG-TAG synthesis is independently regulated by Torsin and Torip/LAP1Torsin removes CTDNEP1 from the nuclear envelope and excludes Lipin from the nucleusExcess nuclear envelope NEP1R1-CTDNEP1/ Lipin activity impairs multiple aspects of NPC biogenesisNEP1R1-CTDNEP1/ Lipin inhibition prevents cellular defects associated with TOR1A and TOR1AIP1 / LAP1 diseaseCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Most studies addressing Wolbachia-induced incompatibilities concern closely-related populations, which are intrinsically compatible. Here, we used three populations of two genetically differentiated colour forms of the haplodiploid spider mite Tetranychus urticae to dissect the interaction between Wolbachia-induced and host-associated incompatibilities, and to assess their relative contribution to post-mating isolation. We found that these two sources of incompatibility act through different mechanisms in an additive fashion. Host-associated incompatibility contributes 1.5 times more than Wolbachia-induced incompatibility in reducing hybrid production, the former through an overproduction of haploid sons at the expense of diploid daugters (ca. 75% decrease) and the latter by increasing the embryonic mortality of daughters (by ca. 49%). Furthermore, regardless of cross direction, we observed near-complete F1 hybrid sterility and complete F2 hybrid breakdown between populations of the two forms, but that Wolbachia did not contribute to this outcome. This study identifies the mechanistic independence and additive nature of host-intrinsic and Wolbachia-induced sources of isolation. It suggests that Wolbachia could drive reproductive isolation in this system, thereby potentially affecting host differentiation and distribution in the field.",

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Shr3 is an ER membrane-localized chaperone that is specifically required for the functional expression of amino acid permeases (AAP), a family of eighteen transporters comprised of 12 MS. Here, comprehensive scanning mutagenesis and deletion analysis of Shr3, combined with a modified split-ubiquitin approach, were used to probe chaperone-substrate interactions with seven different AAP in vivo. Our findings indicate that Shr3 specifically recognizes AAP substrates, largely independent of sequence-specific interactions involving membrane and luminally oriented domains. Shr3 selectively and robustly interacts with nested C-terminal AAP truncations in marked contrast to similar truncations of non-Shr3 substrate polytopic sugar transporters. Strikingly, Shr3-AAP interactions initiate with the first 4 MS of AAP and successively strengthen, but abruptly weaken when all 12 MS are present. The data are consistent with Shr3 acting in a temporal manner as a scaffold preventing AAP translation intermediates from engaging in non-productive interactions.",

Bacteriophage (phage) therapy is being considered as a primary option for the treatment of drugresistant infections of these types. We report the successful isolation and characterisation of 30 novel, genetically diverse Klebsiella phages. The isolated phages span six different phage families and nine genera, representing both lysogenic and lytic lifestyles. Individual Klebsiella phage isolates infected up to 11 of the 18 Klebsiella capsule types tested, and all 18 capsule-types were infected by at least one of the phages. Of the Klebsiella-infecting phages presented in this study, the lytic phages are most suitable for phage therapy, based on their broad host range, high virulence, short lysis period and given that they encode no known toxin or antimicrobial resistance genes. Importantly, when applied alone, none of the characterised phages were able to suppress the growth of Klebsiella for more than 12 hours, with some phages only able to suppress growth for 3 hours, likely due to inherent ease of Klebsiella to generate spontaneous phage-resistant mutants. This indicates that for successful phage therapy, a cocktail of multiple phages would be necessary to treat Klebsiella infections.",

    "abstract": "Nucleotide based intergenomic similarities are useful to understand how viruses are related with each other and to classify them. Here we have developed VIRIDIC, which implements the traditional algorithm used by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), Bacterial and Archaeal Viruses Subcommittee, to calculate virus intergenomic similarities. When compared with other software, VIRIDIC gave the best agreement with the traditional algorithm. Furthermore, it proved best at estimating the relatedness between more distantly related phages, relatedness that other tools can significantly overestimate. In addition to the intergenomic similarities, VIRIDIC also calculates three indicators of the alignment ability to capture the relatedness between viruses: the aligned fractions for each genome in a pair and the length ratio between the two genomes. The main output of VIRIDIC is a heatmap integrating the intergenomic similarity values with information regarding the genome lengths and the aligned genome fraction. VIRIDIC is available at viridic.icbm.de, both as a web-service and a stand-alone tool. It allows fast analysis of large phage genome datasets, especially in the stand-alone version, which can be run on the user\u2019s own servers and can be integrated in bioinformatics pipelines. VIRIDIC was developed having viruses of Bacteria and Archaea in mind, however, it could potentially be used for eukaryotic viruses as well, as long as they are monopartite.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStandard protocols for Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were adopted and being used in a global scale for surveillance of many bacterial food-borne diseases. Matched PFGE bands are considered regardless of co-migration of different DNA fragments. Molecular epidemiology is turning toward whole genome sequencing (WGS). Although, WGS results can be digested In-silico, PFGE and WGS data are being compared separately. We describe a new image analysis algorithm that enables identification of how many DNA fragments co-migrate during PFGE. We built a database that compare described PFGE results to in-silico obtained digestion models (from WGS). Reliability of the method was assessed in-silico using novel computer simulation approach. From WGS, 1,816 digestion model (DMs) were obtained as recommended by PulseNet international. Simulation codes were designed to predict PFGE profiles when DMs are separated at 5% PFGE resolution in addition to expected co-migration levels.\n\nResultsPFGE simulation has shown that about 35% of DNA fragments co-migrate at 5% PFGE resolution. Similar result was obtained when wet-lab PFGE profiles were analyzed using image analysis algorithm mentioned earlier. When image analysis results were compared to DMs, results returned by geltowgs.uofk.edu database revealed reasonable relatedness to DMs. In terms of number of PFGE typable DNA fragments, 45,517 were typable (representing 46.54% out of 97,801). Previously mentioned typable fragments (in terms of typable sizes) comprised 91.24% of the sum of nucleotides of all chromosomes tested (7.24 billion bp). However, significant variations were shown within and between different digestion protocols.\n\nConclusionsIdentification of co-migration levels will reveal the third dimension of PFGE profiles. This will provide a better way for evaluating isolate relationships. Linking old PFGE results to WGS by means of simulation demonstrated here will provide a chance to link millions of PFGE epidemiological data accumulated during the last 24 years to the new WGS era. Evaluation of population dynamics of pathogenic bacteria will be deeper through space and time. Selection of restriction enzymes for PFGE typing will have a powerful in-silico evaluation tool.",

    "abstract": "Effects of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) to the estuarine biota have mostly been shown for concentrations higher than those actually measured or predicted in these environments. To address this gap, a range of concentrations expected to occur in estuarine environments (from 0.01 to 1 \u03bcg g-1) was employed in microcosms studies to assess the impact of Cu NPs in the denitrification pathway. That was achieved by quantifying gene expression and the potential denitrification rate in estuarine sediments exposed to Cu NPs for up to six days. Expression of nitrite (nirS) and nitrous oxide (nosZ) reductase genes was enhanced in a timewise manner. For the highest Cu NPs (1 \u03bcg g-1) an increase in gene expression could be seen immediately after 1 h of exposure, and continuing to be enhanced up until 7 h of exposure. For the lowest Cu NPs (0.01 \u03bcg g-1) an increase in gene expression could only be seen after 4 h or 7 h of exposure; however it continued to rise up until 24 h of exposure. In any case, after 48 h the expression levels were no longer different from the non-exposed control. Concomitantly to increased gene expression the potential denitrification rate was increased by 30 %. Our results suggest that deposition and adsorption of Cu NPs to estuarine sediments promotes the immediate and transient expression of key genes of the denitrification pathway. The long term impact of continuous inputs of Cu NPs into estuaries deserves renewed analysis to account for their effects, not just on the biota, but especially on ecosystems services.Environmental significance Interactions of metallic nanoparticles with microbial communities of estuarine sediments are poorly characterized and its impact towards ecosystem services even less. By assessing the effect of copper nanoparticles on the expression of key genes of the denitrification pathway, an essential step for nitrogen (N) removal, we were able to show that denitrifying communities are immediately activated after exposure, increasing the denitrification rates in estuaries. The importance of denitrification lies in its release of dinitrogen (N2) to the atmosphere but also in the emissions of N2O (a potent greenhouse gas). The results obtained in this study gather data that contribute information on the denitrification dynamics in estuaries, invaluable for a timely response to the expected upcoming changes in coastal areas.Table of contentsIn estuaries the deposition upon the sediments of copper nanoparticles can contribute to change metal availability and promote the activity of denitrifying bacteriaCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe programmable nuclease technology CRISPR/Cas9 has revolutionized gene editing in the last decade. Due to the risk of off-target editing, accurate and sensitive methods for off-target characterization are crucial prior to applying CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutically. Here, we utilized a rhesus macaque model to ask whether CIRCLE-Seq (CS), an in vitro off-target prediction method, more accurately identifies off-targets compared to in silico prediction (ISP) based solely on genomic sequence comparisons. We use AmpliSeq HD error-corrected sequencing to validate off-target sites predicted by CIRCLE-Seq and ISP for guide RNAs designed against TET2 and CD33 genes. A gRNA targeting TET2 designed using modern algorithms and predicted to have low off-target risk by both ISP and CIRCLE-Seq created no detectable mutations at off-target sites in hematopoietic cells following transplantation, even when applying highly sensitive error-corrected sequencing. In contrast, a CD33 gRNA designed using less robust algorithms with over 10-fold more off-targets sites predicted by both ISP and CIRCLE-Seq, however there was poor correlation between the sites predicted by the two methods. When almost 500 sites identified by each method were searched for in hematopoietic cells following transplantation, 19 detectable mutations in off-target sites were detected via error-corrected sequencing. Of these 19 sites, 8 sites were predicted in the top 500 sites by both methods, 8 by CIRCLE-Seq only, and 3 by ISP only. Cells with off-target editing exhibited no expansion or abnormal behavior in vivo in animals followed for up to 2 years. In conclusion, neither methodology predicted all sites, and a combination of careful gRNA design, followed by screening for predicted off-target sites in target cells by multiple methods may be required for optimizing safety of clinical development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

We show here that following pathogenic seeding, tau condenses on the nuclear envelope (NE) and disrupts nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (NCT). Interestingly, NE fluorescent tau signals and small fluorescent inclusions behaved as demixed liquid droplets in living cells. Thioflavin S-positive intracellular aggregates were prevalent in tau-derived inclusions with a size bigger than 3 m2, indicating that a threshold of critical mass in the liquid state condensation may drive liquid-solid phase transitions. Our findings indicate that tau undergoing LLPS is more toxic amongst a spectrum of alternative conformers; LLPS droplets on the NE that disrupt NCT serve to trigger cell death and can act as nurseries for fibrillar structures abundantly detected in end-stage disease.",

    "abstract": "Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient whose uptake is tightly regulated to prevent either deficiency or oxidative stress. Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential heavy metal that induces both Fe-deficiency and oxidative stress; however, the mechanisms underlying these Cd-induced responses are still elusive. Here we explored Cd-induced Fe-associated responses in wildtype Arabidopsis and opt3-2, a mutant that over-accumulates Fe. Gene expression profiling revealed a large overlap between transcripts induced by Fe-deficiency and Cd exposure in wildtype plants and the opt3 mutant. Interestingly, vascular-localized Fe-responsive genes were found to be highly induced by Cd even in the presence of high Fe and H2O2 levels, suggesting that Cd impairs Fe sensing. It was recently shown that Fe-S cluster-containing proteins AtNEET, play a role in Fe sensing. Our data shows that Cd negatively impacts both the stability and Fe-S transfer activity of AtNEET. Altogether, our data indicate that Fe-deficiency responses are governed by multiple inputs and that a hierarchical regulation of Fe-deficiency responses prevents the induction of specific gene networks when Fe and H2O2 levels are high. Other Cd/Fe-responsive genes however, are insensitive to this negative feedback regulation suggesting that their induction is the result of an impaired Fe sensing as opposed to the traditional view of Cd/Fe uptake competition at the root level.Highlight Cadmium induces an iron-deficiency response often explained by root uptake competition; here we show that Cd also impairs Fe sensing in leaves, even when Fe is in sufficient quantities.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe conserved bilateral habenular nuclei (HA) in vertebrate diencephalon develop into compartmentalized structures containing neurons derived from different cell lineages. Despite extensive studies demonstrated that zebrafish larval HA display distinct left-right (L-R) asymmetry in gene expression and connectivity, the spatial gene expression domains were mainly obtained from two-dimensional (2D) snapshots of colorimetric RNA in situ hybridization staining which could not properly reflect different HA neuronal lineages constructed in three-dimension (3D). Combing the tyramide-based fluorescent mRNA in situ hybridization, confocal microscopy and customized imaging processing procedures, we have created spatial distribution maps of four genes for 4 day old zebrafish and in sibling fish whose L-R asymmetry was spontaneously reversed. 3D volumetric analyses showed that ratios of cpd2, lov, ron and nrp1a expression in L-R reversed HA were reversed according to the parapineal positions. However, the quantitative changes of gene expression in reversed larval brains do not mirror the gene expression level in the obverse larval brains. There were a total 87.78% increase of lov+nrp1a+ and a total 12.45% decrease of lov+ron+ double-positive neurons when the L-R asymmetry of HA was reversed. Thus, our volumetric analyses of the 3D maps indicate that changes of HA neuronal cell fates are associated with the reversal of HA laterality. These changes likely account for the behavior changes associated with HA laterality alterations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) pili and flagellum are critical for the surface attachment of Vibrio cholerae, the first step of V. cholerae colonization on host surfaces. However, the cell landing mechanism remains largely unknown, particularly in viscoelastic environments such as the mucus layers of intestines. Here, combining the cysteine-substitution-based labelling method with single-cell tracking techniques, we quantitatively characterized the landing of V. cholerae by directly observing both pili and flagellum of cells in a viscoelastic non-Newtonian solution consisting of 2% Luria-Bertani and 1% methylcellulose (LB+MC). The results show that MSHA pili are evenly distributed along the cell length and can stick to surfaces at any point along the filament. With such properties, MSHA pili are observed to act as a brake and anchor during cell landing which include three phases: running, lingering, and attaching. Importantly, loss of MSHA pili results in a more dramatic increase in mean path length in LB+MC than in 2% LB only or in 20% Ficoll solutions, indicating that the role of MSHA pili during cell landing is more apparent in viscoelastic non-Newtonian fluids than viscous Newtonian ones. Our work provides a detailed picture of the landing dynamics of V. cholerae under viscoelastic conditions, which can provide insights into ways to better control V. cholerae infections in real mucus-like environment.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury confers a significant and growing public health burden and represents a major environmental risk factor for dementia. Previous efforts to model traumatic brain injury and elucidate pathologic mechanisms have been hindered by complex interactions between multiple cell types, biophysical, and degenerative properties of the human brain. Here, we use high-intensity focused ultrasound to induce mechanical injury in 3D human pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical organoids to mimic traumatic brain injury in vitro. Our results show that mechanically injured organoids recapitulate key hallmarks of traumatic brain injury, phosphorylation of tau and TDP-43, neurodegeneration, and transcriptional programs indicative of energy deficits. We present high-intensity focused ultrasound as a novel, reproducible model of traumatic brain injury in cortical organoids with potential for scalable and temporally-defined mechanistic studies.",

    "abstract": "Human mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) variations, such as mtDNA heteroplasmies (the co-existence of mutated and wild-type mtDNA), have received increasing attention in recent years for their clinical relevance to numerous diseases. But large-scale population studies of mtDNA heteroplasmies have been lagging due to the lack of a labor- and cost-effective method. Here, we present a novel human mtDNA sequencing method called STAMP (sequencing by targeted amplification of multiplex probes) for measuring mtDNA heteroplasmies and content in a streamlined workflow. We show that STAMP has high mapping rates to mtDNA, deep coverage of unique reads, and high tolerance to sequencing and PCR errors when applied to human samples. STAMP also has high sensitivity and low false positive rates in identifying artificial mtDNA variants at fractions as low as 0.5% in genomic DNA samples. We further extend STAMP, by including nuclear DNA-targeting probes, to enable assessment of relative mtDNA content in the same assay. The high cost-effectiveness of STAMP, along with the flexibility of using it for measuring various aspects of mtDNA variations, will accelerate the research of mtDNA heteroplasmies and content in large population cohorts, and in the context of human diseases and aging.",
