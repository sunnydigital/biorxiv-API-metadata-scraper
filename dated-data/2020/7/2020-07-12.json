    "abstract": "Physical spaces and nutrients are prerequisites to the survival of organisms while few interspecies mutual strategies are documented that satisfies them. Here we discovered a mutualistic mechanism between filamentous fungus and bacterium, Aspergillus nidulans and Bacillus subtilis. The bacterial cells co-cultured with the fungus traveled along mycelia depending on their flagella and dispersed farther with the expansion of fungal colony, indicating that the fungal mycelia supply space for bacteria to migrate, disperse and proliferate. Transcriptomic, genetic, molecular mass and imaging analyses demonstrated that the bacteria reach the mycelial edge and supply thiamine to the growing hyphae, resulting in a promotion of hyphal growth. The thiamine transfer from bacteria to the thiamine non-auxotrophic fungus is directly demonstrated by stable isotope labeling. The simultaneous spatial and metabolic interactions demonstrated in this study, reveal a mutualism that facilitates the communicating fungal and bacterial species to obtain environmental niche and nutrient respectively.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide CoVid-19 pandemic has led to an unprecedented push across the whole of the scientific community to develop a potent antiviral drug and vaccine as soon as possible. Existing academic, governmental and industrial institutions and companies have engaged in large-scale screening of existing drugs, in vitro, in vivo and in silico. Here, we are using in silico modelling of SARS-CoV-2 drug targets, i.e. SARS-CoV-2 protein structures as deposited on the Protein Databank (PDB). We study their flexibility, rigidity and mobility, an important first step in trying to ascertain their dynamics for further drug-related docking studies. We are using a recent protein flexibility modelling approach, combining protein structural rigidity with possible motion consistent with chemical bonds and sterics. For example, for the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in the open configuration, our method identifies a possible further opening and closing of the S1 subunit through movement of SB domain. With full structural information of this process available, docking studies with possible drug structures are then possible in silico. In our study, we present full results for the more than 200 thus far published SARS-CoV-2-related protein structures in the PDB.",

    "abstract": "Cu-containing nitrite reductases (NiRs), a well-studied family of 110 kDa enzymes, play central roles in denitrification and have over 100 Protein Data Bank entries. However, such issues as crystal packing, photoreduction, and lack of high pH cases have impeded structural analysis of the catalytic mechanism. Here we show the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Achromobacter cycloclastes NiR (AcNiR) at 2.99 and 2.85 [A] resolution with pH 6.2 and 8.1, respectively. Comprehensive comparisons with cryo-EM and 56 AcNiR crystal structures suggested crystallographic artifacts in residues 185-215 and His255 due to packing and photoreduction, respectively. With electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, a newly developed map comparison method supported local structural changes at pH 8.1 around the type-2 Cu site, including His255 deprotonation. While the theoretical coordination error estimation of cryo-EM structures remains difficult, combined analysis using X-ray and cryo-EM structures will allow deeper insight into the local structural changes of proteins.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification associated with transcriptional repression, and plays key roles in normal cell growth as well as oncogenesis. Among the three main DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B), DNMT3A mediates de novo DNA methylation with partial functional redundancy with DNMT3B. However, the general effects of DNMT3A and its downstream gene regulation profile are yet to be unveiled. In the present study, we used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to successfully create DNMT3A deficient human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293, with frameshift mutations in its catalytic domain. Our results showed that the cell growth slowed down in DNMT3A knockout cells. UPLC-MS analysis of DNMT3A deficient cells showed that the genome-level DNA methylation was reduced by 21.5% and led to an impairment of cell proliferation as well as a blockage of MAPK and PI3K-Akt pathways. Whole genome RNA-seq revealed that DNMT3A knockout up-regulated expression of genes and pathways related to cell metabolism but down-regulated those involved in ribosome function, which explained the inhibition of cell growth and related signal pathways. Further, bisulfite DNA treatment showed that DNMT3A ablation reduced the methylation level of DNMT3B gene as well, indicating the higher DNMT3B activity and thereby explaining those down-regulated profiles of genes.",

    "abstract": "Pork adulteration is a major concern for Muslims and Jews whose diets are restricted by religious beliefs, as well as those who are allergic to pork meat and its derivatives. Accurate pork authentication is of great importance to assist this demographic group of people in making decision on their product purchase. The aim of this study was to develop a new analytical method for pork authentication in processed-meat products based on a combination of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and AuNP-nanoprobe colourimetric assay. The LAMP conditions were first optimised to obtain the highest yield of amplified DNA products within the shortest time. Oligoprobe-functionalised AuNPs were then hybridised with LAMP-DNA amplicons, and subsequently challenged with MgSO4 at a high concentration to induce AuNP aggregation. In the presence of pork DNA, the colloidal AuNPs-probe remained unchanged in its red colour, which indicates the dispersion of AuNPs. In contrast, in the absence of pork DNA, the colour was changed to colourless as a result from the aggregation of AuNPs. The LAMP-AuNP-nanoprobe assay offers a high sensitivity with a limit of detection as low as 100 pg of pork DNA. The assay is highly specific to pork content without cross-reactivity with the other meat species tested. The assay developed herein can become a simple, inexpensive, precise, and rapid analytical tool for small laboratories or the general public interested in halal food authentication.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are the master regulators of numerous biological processes. Hypoxia causes oxidative stress with severe and detrimental effects on brain function and acts as a critical initiating factor in the pathogenesis of Alzheimers disease (AD). From the RNA-Seq in the forebrain (Fb), midbrain (Mb), and hindbrain (Hb) regions of hypoxic and normoxic zebrafish, we identified novel lncRNAs, whose potential cis targets showed involvement in neuronal development and differentiation pathways. Under hypoxia, several lncRNAs and mRNAs were differentially expressed. Co-expression studies indicated that the Fb and Hb regions potential lncRNA target genes were involved in the AD pathogenesis. In contrast, those in Mb (cry1b, per1a, cipca) were responsible for regulating circadian rhythm. We identified specific lncRNAs present in the syntenic regions between zebrafish and humans, possibly functionally conserved. We thus identified several conserved lncRNAs as the probable regulators of AD genes (adrb3b, cav1, stat3, bace2, apoeb, psen1, s100b).",

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder primarily caused by heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked gene MECP2 that is a global transcriptional regulator. Mutations in the methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) of MECP2 disrupt its interaction with methylated DNA. Here, we investigate the effect of MECP2 L124W missense mutation in the MBD of an atypical RTT patient in comparison to severe MECP2 null mutations. L124W protein had a limited ability to disrupt heterochromatic chromocenters due to decreased binding dynamics. We isolated two pairs of isogenic WT and L124W induced pluripotent stem cells. L124W induced excitatory neurons expressed stable protein, exhibited increased input resistance and decreased voltage-gated Na+ and K+ currents, and their neuronal dysmorphology was limited to decreased dendritic complexity. Three isogenic pairs of MECP2 null neurons had the expected more extreme morphological and electrophysiological phenotypes. We examined development and maturation of L124W and MECP2 null excitatory neural network activity using micro-electrode arrays. Relative to isogenic controls, L124W neurons had an increase in synchronous network burst frequency, in contrast to MECP2 null neurons that suffered a significant decrease in synchronous network burst frequency and a transient extension of network burst duration. We capture these findings in a computational neural network model that shows the observed changes in network dynamics are best explained by changes in intrinsic adaptation currents in individual neurons. Our multilevel results demonstrate that RTT excitatory neurons show a wide spectrum of morphological, electrophysiological and circuitry phenotypes that are dependent on the severity of the MECP2 mutation.",

    "abstract": "Identical physical inputs do not always evoke identical percepts. To investigate the role of stimulus history in tactile perception, we designed a task in which rats had to judge each vibrissal vibration, in a long series, as strong or weak depending on its mean speed. After a low-speed stimulus (trial n-1), rats were more likely to report the next stimulus (trial n) as strong, and after a high-speed stimulus, they were more likely to report the next stimulus as weak, a repulsive effect that did not depend on choice or reward on trial n-1. This effect could be tracked over several preceding trials (i.e. n-2 and earlier) and was characterized by an exponential decay function, reflecting a trial-by-trial incorporation of sensory history. Surprisingly, the influence of trial n-1 strengthened as the time interval between n-1 and n grew. Human subjects receiving fingertip vibrations showed these same key findings. We are able to account for the repulsive stimulus history effect, and its detailed time scale, through a single-parameter model, wherein each new stimulus gradually updates the subjects decision criterion. This model points to mechanisms underlying how the past affects the ongoing subjective experience.",

    "abstract": "Frontal midline EEG activity has been found to correlate with error magnitude during motor adaptation. We replicated a previous visuomotor adaptation experiment with very small perturbations, likely to invoke implicit adaptation, in a new group of 60 participants and combined it with EEG recordings. We used this data to explore 1) whether frontal midline activity will be evoked in the absence of awareness of the perturbation; 2) whether frontal midline activity is related to implicit adaptation; 3) whether individual differences in frontal midline activity are related to individual differences in motor learning. The results showed that frontal midline theta activity (FM{Theta}) is also present during small perturbations, does not drive between-trial error correction, and that the sensitivity of FM{Theta} to error magnitude was smaller for participants with greater execution noise. This relation between FM{Theta}-error-sensitivity and execution noise could be fully explained by looking at the relationship between FM{Theta} and error probability. This implies that frontal midline theta activity represents a surprise-like saliency signal, potentially driving awareness and cognitive control in situations with more salient errors.",

    "abstract": "How brain circuits convert sensory signals into goal-oriented movement is a central question in neuroscience. In insects, a region known as the Central Complex (CX) is believed to support navigation, but how its compartments process diverse sensory cues to guide navigation is not fully clear. To address this question, we recorded from genetically-identified CX cell types in Drosophila and presented directional visual, olfactory, and airflow cues known to elicit orienting behavior. We found that a group of columnar neurons targeting the ventral fan-shaped body (ventral P-FNs) are robustly tuned for airflow direction. Unlike compass neurons (E-PGs), ventral P-FNs do not generate a \"map\" of airflow direction; rather they are tuned to two directions - approximately 45{degrees} to the right or left of the midline - depending on the hemisphere of the cell body. Ventral P-FNs with both direction preferences innervate each CX column, potentially forming a basis for constructing representations of airflow in various directions. We explored two possible sources for ventral P-FN airflow tuning, and found that they mostly likely inherit these responses via a pathway from the lateral accessory lobe (LAL) to the noduli (NO). Silencing ventral P-FNs prevented flies from adopting stable orientations relative to airflow in closed-loop flight. Specifically, silenced flies selected improper corrective turns following changes in airflow direction, but not after airflow pauses, suggesting a specific deficit in sensory-motor action selection. Our results identify a group of central complex neurons that robustly encode airflow direction and are required for proper orientation to this stimulus.",

    "abstract": "When attending to many spatially distributed visual stimuli, attention is reweighted rhythmically at 4-8 Hz. The probability of detection depends on the phase at which a stimulus is deployed relative to this intrinsic rhythm. The reweighting oscillations can be observed both electrophysiologically and behaviorally, and appear to be regulated by the pulvinar. Based on these findings, we considered the computational consequences of allowing feedback to shape the distribution of inhibitory oscillations from the thalamus, as measured by a local field potential (LFP) phases in the 8 Hz low alpha-band, across laterally-connected regions of the visual cortex. We constructed a population activity model with lateral and feedforward connections. In agreement with prior models, we found that the sign of the lateral phase difference in the inhibitory low-frequency oscillations regulated the direction of communication between the laterally-connected regions. Furthermore, the phase difference induced periodicity in the dynamics of a downstream winner-takes-all attractor network such that periodic switching between states was observed. We finally simulated a simple spatial attention task. We found rhythmic 8 Hz sampling between two regions when a lateral phase difference was present--an effect that disappeared when the lateral phase difference was zero. These findings are in agreement with spatial attention literature and suggest that lateral phase differences are essential for manifesting communicational asymmetries in laterally-connected visual cortices. Our model predicts that population-specific phase differences are critical for sampling the spatial extent of stimuli.\n\nAuthor summaryWe conducted a computational study of the effects of lateral phase differences in a simulated model of the visual cortex. Lateral phase differences are defined to be when the phase of an intrinsic low-frequency inhibitory oscillation varies consistently across populations in the same cortical area. For example, our model was intended to capture the dynamics of a retinotopic cortex where feedback from the frotoparietal areas via the pulvinar nucleus assigned laterally-connected regions of the visual cortex different phases. We found that the sign of the phase differences influenced the direction of lateral communication. Furthermore, the phase differences introduced rhythmicity in the downstream areas, thus allowing us to simulate rhythmic spatial selection of stimuli. Prior to the current study, the influence of inter-areal phase differences in feedforward models had been well characterized. Our model provides new insights into the dynamics of population-specific lateral phase differences and predicts that the development of phase differences across the visual cortex are critical for the allocation of attention in space.",

    "abstract": "Context dependent top-down modulation in visual processing has been a topic of wide interest. Recent findings on context dependent modulation, combined with the tools available to investigate network mechanisms in the mouse, make the mouse primary visual cortex an ideal system to investigate context-dependent modulation. However, the distribution of inputs to V1 from across the brain is still relatively unknown. In this study, we investigate inputs to V1 by injecting cholera toxin B subunit (CTB), a retrograde tracer, across the extent of V1. To identify CTB labelled cell bodies and quantify their distribution across various brain regions, we developed a software pipeline that maps each labelled cell body to its corresponding brain region. We found over fourteen brain regions that provided inputs to V1. Higher visual areas (HVAs) provided the most inputs to V1, followed by the retrosplenial, cingulate, and other sensory cortices. As our injections spanned a range of coordinates along the mediolateral axis of V1, we asked if there was any topographic organisation of inputs to V1: do particular areas project preferentially to specific regions of V1. Based on the distribution of inputs from different HVAs, injection sites broadly clustered into two groups, consistent with a retinotopic separation into sites within the central visual field and the peripheral visual field. Furthermore, the number of cells detected in HVAs was correlated to the azimuthal retinotopic location of each injection site. This topographic organization of feedback projections along the medio-lateral axis of V1 suggests that V1 cells representing peripheral vs central visual fields are differentially modulated by HVAs, which may have an ethological relevance for a navigating animal.",

    "abstract": "A novel experimental paradigm, \"deconvolution of ears activity\" (DEA), is presented which allows to disentangle overlapping neural activity from both auditory cortices when two auditory stimuli are presented closely together in time in each ear.\n\nPairs of multi-tone complexes were presented either binaurally, or sequentially by alternating presentation order in each ear (i.e., first tone complex of the pair presented to one ear and second tone complex to the other ear), using stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs) shorter than the neural response length. This timing strategy creates overlapping responses, which can be mathematically separated using least-squares deconvolution.\n\nThe DEA paradigm allowed the evaluation of the neural representation in the auditory cortex of responses to stimuli presented at syllabic rates (i.e., SOAs between 120 and 260 ms). Analysis of the neuromagnetic responses in each cortex offered a sensitive technique to study hemispheric lateralization, ear representation (right versus left), pathway advantage (contra- versus ipsi-lateral) and cortical binaural interaction.\n\nTo provide a proof-of-concept of the DEA paradigm, data was recorded from three normal-hearing adults. Results showed good test-retest reliability, and indicated that the difference score between hemispheres can potentially be used to assess central auditory processing.

    "abstract": "Fear is an extreme form of aversion that, if inappropriately generalized, initiates pathological conditions such as panic or anxiety. Fear conditioning (FC) is the best understood model of fear learning. During FC two independent associations link the cue and the training context to fear expression. The lateral habenula (LHb) is a general encoder of aversion. However, its role in fear learning has not been intensively studied. Here we studied the role of the LHb in FC using optogenetics and pharmacological tools in rats. Disrupting the neuronal activity of the LHb during training abolishes the expression of fear to isolated presentation of the training context or the cue, yet the recall of both associations when the cue is played in the training context reveals a conserved memory. Our results demonstrate that the LHb is required for the formation of independently expressible contextual and cued memories, a previously uncharacterized role in FC.",

    "abstract": "How do descending inputs from the brain control leg motor circuits to change the way an animal walks? Conceptually, descending neurons are thought to function either as command-type neurons, in which a single type of descending neuron exerts a high-level control to elicit a coordinated change in motor output, or through a more distributed population coding mechanism, whereby a group of neurons, each with local effects, act in combination to elicit a global motor response. The Drosophila Moonwalker Descending Neurons (MDNs), which alter leg motor circuit dynamics so that the fly walks backwards, exemplify the command-type mechanism. Here, we identify several dozen MDN target neurons within the leg motor circuits, and show that two of them mediate distinct and highly-specific changes in leg muscle activity during backward walking: LIN156 neurons provide the hindleg power stroke during stance phase; LIN128 neurons lift the legs at the end of stance to initiate swing. Through these two effector neurons, MDN directly controls both the stance and swing phases of the backward stepping cycle. MDN exerts these changes only upon the hindlegs; the fore-and midlegs follow passively through ground contact. These findings suggest that command-type descending neurons can also operate through the distributed control of local motor circuits.",

    "abstract": "Studies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) typically incorporate a fade-in, short-stimulation, fade-out sham (placebo) protocol, which is assumed to be indistinct from a 10-30min active protocol on the scalp. However, many studies report that participants can dissociate active stimulation from sham, even during low-intensity 1mA currents. We recently identified differences in the perception of an active (10min of 1mA) and a sham (20s of 1mA) protocol that lasted for 5 mins after the cessation of sham. In the present study we assessed whether delivery of a higher-intensity 2mA current would exacerbate these differences. Two protocols were delivered to 32 adults in a double-blinded, within-subjects design (active: 10min of 2mA, and sham: 20s of 2mA), with the anode over the left primary motor cortex and the cathode on the right forehead. Participants were asked \"Is the stimulation on?\" and \"How sure are you?\" at 30s intervals during and after stimulation. The differences between active and sham were more consistent and sustained during 2mA than during 1mA. We then quantified how well participants were able to track the presence and absence of stimulation (i.e. their sensitivity) during the experiment using cross-correlations. Current strength was a good classifier of sensitivity during active tDCS, but exhibited only moderate specificity during sham. The accuracy of the end-of-study guess was no better than chance at predicting sensitivity. Our results indicate that the traditional end-of-study guess poorly reflects the sensitivity of participants to stimulation, and may not be a valid method of assessing sham blinding.",

    "abstract": "The reproducibility and translation of neuroscience research is assumed to be undermined by introducing environmental complexity and heterogeneity. Rearing laboratory animals with minimal (if any) environmental stimulation is thought to control for biological variability but may not adequately test the robustness of our animal models. Standard laboratory housing is associated with reduced demonstrations of species typical behaviors and changes in neurophysiology that may impact the translation of research results. Modest increases in environmental enrichment (EE), mitigate against insults used to induce animal models of disease, directly calling into question the translatability of our work. This may in part underlie the disconnect between preclinical and clinical research findings. Enhancing environmental stimulation for our model organisms promotes ethological natural behaviors but may simultaneously increase phenotypic trait variability. To test this assumption, we conducted a systematic review and evaluated coefficients of variation between EE and standard housed mice and rats. Given findings of suboptimal reporting of animal laboratory housing conditions, we also developed a methodological reporting table for enrichment use in neuroscience research. Our data show that animals housed in environmental enrichment were not more variable than those in standard housing. Therefore, environmental heterogeneity introduced into the laboratory, in the form of enrichment, does not compromise data integrity. Overall, human life is complicated and by embracing such nuanced complexity into our laboratories we may paradoxically improve upon the rigor and reproducibility of our research.\n\nSignificance StatementEnvironmental complexity is thought to increase phenotypic variability, undermining research translation. We conducted a systematic review and compared coefficients of variation between environmentally enriched and standard housed laboratory animals. Despite there being no differences in variability across several phenotypic traits, there are stark contrasts in the display of ethological natural behaviors between these housing conditions. Environmental enrichment is recognized as being beneficial for animal welfare and mitigates against insults used to induce animal models of disease. In contrast, standard laboratory cages are recognized as being impoverished and  unnatural. From these observations, it is apparent that our current \"gold standard\" caging system is not a true control condition as it does not adequately test the robustness of our animal models.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus reuniens of the thalamus (NRe) is reciprocally connected to a range of higher order cortices including hippocampus (HPC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The physiological function of NRe is well predicted by requirement for interactions between mPFC and HPC, including associative recognition memory, spatial navigation and working memory. Although anatomical and electrophysiological evidence suggests NRe makes excitatory synapses in mPFC there is little data on the physiological properties of these projections, or whether NRe and HPC target overlapping cell populations and, if so, how they interact. We demonstrate in ex vivo mPFC slices that NRe and HPC afferent inputs converge onto more than two-thirds of layer 5 pyramidal neurons, show that NRe, but not HPC, undergoes marked short-term plasticity at theta, and that HPC, but not NRe, afferents are subject to neuromodulation by acetylcholine acting via muscarinic receptor M2. Finally, we demonstrate that pairing HPC followed by NRe (but not pairing NRe followed by HPC) at theta frequency induces associative, NMDA receptor dependent synaptic plasticity in both inputs to mPFC. These data provide vital physiological phenotypes of the synapses of this circuit and provide a novel mechanism for HPC-NRe-mPFC encoding.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety can be an adaptive process that promotes harm avoidance. It is accompanied by shifts in cognitive processing, but the precise nature of these changes and the neural mechanisms that underlie them are not fully understood. One theory is that anxiety impairs concurrent (non-harm related) cognitive processing by commandeering finite neurocognitive resources. For example, we have previously shown that anxiety reliably  speeds up time, promoting temporal underestimation, possibly due to loss of temporal information. Whether this is due anxiety  overloading neurocognitive processing of time is unknown. We therefore set out to understand the neural correlates of this effect, examining whether anxiety and time processing overlap, particularly in regions of the cingulate cortex. Across two studies (an exploratory Study 1, N=13, followed by a pre-registered Study 2, N=29) we combined a well-established anxiety manipulation (threat of shock) with a temporal bisection task while participants were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Consistent with our previous work, time was perceived to pass more quickly under induced anxiety. Anxiety induction led to widespread activation in cingulate cortex, while the perception of longer intervals was associated with more circumscribed activation in a mid-cingulate area. Importantly, conjunction analysis identified convergence between anxiety and time processing in the insula and mid-cingulate cortex. These results provide tentative support for the hypothesis that anxiety impacts cognitive processing by overloading already-in-use neural resources. In particular, overloading mid-cingulate cortex capacity may drive emotion-related changes in temporal perception, consistent with the hypothesised role of this region in mediating cognitive affective and behavioural responses to anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Controllability over stressors has major impacts on brain and behavior. In humans, however, the effect of controllability on the responses to stressors themselves is poorly understood. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated how controllability altered responses to a shock-plus-sound stressor. Using a between-group yoked design, participants in controlled and uncontrolled groups experienced the same amount of stressor exposure. Employing both Bayesian multilevel analysis targeting regions of interest and standard voxelwise analysis, we found that controllability decreased stressor-related responses across key threat-related regions, notably in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (part of the extended amygdala) and the anterior insula. The posterior cingulate cortex, the posterior insula, and possibly the medial frontal gyrus (in exploratory analyses) were uncovered as sites where control over the stressor increased brain responses. Our findings support the idea that the aversiveness of the stressor is reduced when controllable, leading to decreased responses across key regions involved in anxiety-related processing, even at the level of the extended amygdala.",

    "abstract": "Sensory processing varies depending on behavioral context. Here, we asked how task-engagement modulates neurons in the auditory system. We trained mice in a simple tone-detection task, and compared their neuronal activity during passive hearing and active listening. Electrophysiological extracellular recordings in the inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, primary auditory cortex and anterior auditory field revealed widespread modulations across all regions and cortical layers, and in both putative regular and fast-spiking cortical neurons. Clustering analysis unveiled ten distinct modulation patterns that could either enhance or suppress neuronal activity. Task-engagement changed the tone-onset response in most neurons. Such modulations first emerged in subcortical areas, ruling out cortical feedback from primary auditory areas as the only mechanism underlying subcortical modulations. Half the neurons additionally displayed late modulations associated with licking, arousal or reward. Our results reveal the presence of functionally distinct subclasses of neurons, differentially sensitive to specific task-related variables but anatomically distributed along the auditory pathway.",
