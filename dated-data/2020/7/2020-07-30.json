    "abstract": "ObjectivesOur previous study showed that long-term practitioners of Sahaja Yoga Meditation (SYM) had around 7% larger grey matter volume (GMV) in the whole brain compared with healthy controls; however, when testing individual regions, only 5 small brain areas were statistically different between groups. Under the hypothesis that those results were statistically conservative, with the same dataset, we investigated in more detail the regional differences in GMV associated with the practice of SYM, with a different statistical approach.\n\nDesignTwenty-three experienced practitioners of SYM and 23 healthy non-meditators matched on age, gender and education level, were scanned using structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging. Their GMV were extracted and compared using Voxel-Based Morphometry. Using a novel ad-hoc GLM model, statistical comparisons were made to observe if the GMV differences between meditators and controls were statistically significant.\n\nResultsIn the 16 lobe area subdivisions, GMV was statistically significantly different in 4 out of 16 areas: Right hemispheric temporal and frontal lobes, left frontal lobe and brainstem.\n\nIn the 116 AAL area subdivisions, GMV difference was statistically significant in 11 areas. The GMV differences were statistically more significant in right hemispheric brain areas.\n\nConclusionsThe study shows that long-term practice of SYM is associated with larger GMV overall, and with significant differences mainly in temporal and frontal areas of the right hemisphere and the brainstem. These neuroplastic changes may reflect emotional and attentional control mechanisms developed with SYM. On the other hand, our statistical ad-hoc method shows that there were more brain areas with statistical significance compared to the traditional methodology which we think is susceptible to conservative Type II errors.",

    "abstract": "Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) are a growing subset of agricultural adjuncts which can be used to increase crop yield and plant productivity. Although substantial research has been conducted on the metabolites and active molecules secreted by PGPBs, relatively little is known about their effects on the global transcriptome of the host plant. The present study was carried out to investigate changes in the gene expression landscape of early vegetative Brassica napus following treatment with Pseudomonas chlororaphis PA23. This PGPB was isolated from the soybean rhizosphere and has been extensively studied as a biocontrol agent. However, little is known about its effects on plant growth and development. Using a combination of RNA-sequencing and physiological analyses, we identified increased abundance of mRNA transcripts associated with photosynthesis and phytohormone response.\n\nPhenotypically we observed increased photosynthetic rates and larger root and shoot systems in B. napus following P. chlororaphis PA23 treatment. Lastly, we identified auxin production by P. chlororaphis PA23 which likely contributes to changes in gene expression and the observed phenotypic differences in root and shoot structures. Together, the results of our study suggest that PA23 is a potent plant growth promoting agent with the potential for field applications as an agricultural adjunct.",

While the enzymatic roles of these complexes are undisputed, little is known about the interactions of the subunits beyond their presence in the monomeric protein complexes and their functions in regulating mitochondria metabolism. By applying one of the most important regulatory cues for plant metabolism, the presence or absence of light, we here assess the changes in the composition and molecular mass of known mitochondrial protein complexes by employing a differential complexome profiling strategy. Covering a mass range up to 25 MDa, we demonstrate dynamic associations of TCA-cycle enzymes and of OXPHOS components.

    "abstract": "In multicellular organisms, sexual reproduction requires the separation of the germline from the soma. In flowering plants, the first cells of the germline, so-called spore mother cells (SMCs), differentiate as the reproductive organs form. Here, we explored how organ growth influences and contributes to SMC differentiation. We generated a collection of 92 annotated 3D images capturing ovule primordium ontogeny at cellular resolution in Arabidopsis. We identified a spatio-temporal pattern of cell divisions that acts in a domain-specific manner as the primordium forms, which is coupled with the emergence of a single SMC. Using tissue growth models, we uncovered plausible morphogenetic principles involving a spatially confined growth signal, differential mechanical properties, and cell growth anisotropy. Our analysis also reveals that SMC characteristics first arise in more than one cell but SMC fate becomes progressively restricted to a single cell during organ growth. Altered primordium geometry coincided with a delay in this fate restriction process in katanin mutants. Altogether, our study suggests that tissue geometry canalizes and modulates reproductive cell fate in the Arabidopsis ovule primordium.",

    "abstract": "Combining RNA structure probing with high-throughput sequencing technologies has greatly enhanced our ability to analyze RNA structure at transcriptome scale. However, the high level of noise and variability encountered in these data call for the development of computational tools that robustly extract RNA structural information. Here we present diffBUM-HMM, a noise-aware model that enables accurate detection of RNA flexibility and conformational changes from high-throughput RNA structure-probing data. DiffBUM-HMM is compatible with a wide variety of high-throughput RNA structure probing data, taking into consideration biological variation, sequence coverage and sequence representation biases. We demonstrate that, compared to the existing approaches, diffBUM-HMM displays higher sensitivity while calling virtually no false positives. DiffBUM-HMM analysis of ex vivo and in vivo Xist SHAPE-MaP data detected many more RNA structural differences, involving mostly single-stranded nucleotides located at or near protein-binding sites. Collectively, our analyses demonstrate the value of diffBUM-HMM for quantitatively detecting RNA structural changes and reinforce the notion that RNA structure probing is a very powerful tool for identifying protein-binding sites.",

    "abstract": "Bile acids (BAs) are lipid emulsifying metabolites synthesized in hepatocytes and maintained in vivo through enterohepatic circulation between the liver and small intestine1. As detergents, BAs can cause toxicity and inflammation in enterohepatic tissues2. Nuclear receptors maintain BA homeostasis in hepatocytes and enterocytes3, but it is unclear how mucosal immune cells tolerate high BA concentrations in the small intestine lamina propria (siLP). We previously reported that CD4+ T effector (Teff) cells upregulate expression of the xenobiotic transporter MDR1/ABCB1 in the siLP to prevent BA toxicity and suppress Crohns disease-like small bowel inflammation4. Here, we identify the nuclear xenobiotic receptor, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR/NR1I3), as a regulator of MDR1 expression in T cells, and safeguard against BA toxicity and inflammation in the small intestine. CAR was activated and induced large-scale transcriptional reprograming in Teff cells infiltrating the siLP, but not the colon. CAR induced expression of detoxifying enzymes and transporters in siLP Teff cells, as in hepatocytes, but also the key anti-inflammatory cytokine, Il10. Accordingly, CAR-deficiency in T cells exacerbated, whereas pharmacologic CAR activation suppressed, BA-driven ileitis in T cell-reconstituted Rag-/- mice. These data suggest that CAR acts locally in small intestinal T cells to detoxify BAs and resolve inflammation. Activation of this program offers an unexpected strategy to treat small bowel Crohns disease, and provides evidence of lymphocyte sub-specialization within the small intestine.",

    "abstract": "PTPN11/SHP2, a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase is a prominent target of the receptor tyrosine kinase that participates in positive feedback signalling of the human epidermal growth factor receptors and helps in growth and migration. PTPN11/SHP2 is widely believed to be an oncoprotein, although its possible tumor-suppressor role is also reported. Our analysis of breast cancer metadata shows, PTPN11/SHP2 copy number loss in luminal A subtype is correlated to poor disease-specific survival and late-stage cancer at diagnosis. Analysis of the level 4 Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA) data available on the TCGA database resulted in positive correlations between the lower expression levels of constitutively active variant, the phospho-SHP2-Y542, of PTPN11/SHP2 and larger tumor size and lymph node positivity. We experimentally examined possible negative regulation of growth by PTPN11/SHP2 using MCF10A, a normal breast epithelial cell line. Knock-down of PTPN11/SHP2 resulted in increased cell migration, cell shape changes to mesenchymal morphology, and increased survival in cells treated with epirubicin, a DNA-damaging drug. However, it did not alter the rate of cell proliferation. It is possible that PTPN11/SHP2 might function as a tumor suppressor by potentiating proliferating cells with increased cell migration and resistance to apoptosis.\n\nStatement of SignificanceMolecules like PTPN11/SHP2, among many others that show dual specificity in tumorigenesis in the same tissue depending on the upstream signaling cues, present challenges in the field of targeted drug therapy. This study puts forth the importance of understanding the mechanism of one of the two outcomes and thereby helps better clinical management of a subgroup of cancer.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive potential of pathogens in novel or heterogeneous environments underpins the risk of disease epidemics. Antagonistic pleiotropy or differential resource allocation among life-history traits can constrain pathogen adaptation. However, we lack understanding how the genetic architecture of individual traits can generate trade-offs. Here, we report a large-scale study based on 145 global strains of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici from four continents. We measured 50 life-history traits, including virulence and reproduction on 12 different wheat hosts and growth responses to several abiotic stressors. To elucidate the genetic basis of adaptation, we used multi-trait genome-wide association mapping. We show that most traits are governed by polygenic architectures and are highly heritable suggesting that adaptation proceeds mainly through allele frequency shifts at many loci. We identified numerous pleiotropic SNPs with conflicting effects on host colonization and survival in stressful environments. Such genetic constraints are likely limiting the pathogens ability to cause host damage and could be exploited for pathogen control. In contrast, adaptation to abiotic stress factors was likely facilitated by synergistic pleiotropy. Our study illustrates how comprehensive mapping of life-history trait architectures across diverse environments allows to predict evolutionary trajectories of pathogens confronted with environmental perturbations.",

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) measures brain activity at rest, which has been linked with both cognitive and clinical outcomes.

Here we utilized rsfMRI from 44,190 individuals of multiple ancestries (37,339 in the UK Biobank) to discover and validate the common genetic variants influencing intrinsic brain activity. We identified hundreds of novel genetic loci associated with intrinsic functional signatures (P < 2.8 x 10-11), including associations to the central executive, default mode, and salience networks involved in the triple network model of psychopathology. A number of intrinsic brain activity associated loci colocalized with brain disorder GWAS (e.g., Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, schizophrenia) and cognition, such as 19q13.32, 17q21.31, and 2p16.1. Particularly, we detected a colocalization between one (rs429358) of the two variants in the APOE {varepsilon}4 locus and function of the default mode, central executive, attention, and visual networks. Genetic correlation analysis demonstrated shared genetic influences between brain function and brain structure in the same regions. We also detected significant genetic correlations with 26 other complex traits, such as ADHD, major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, intelligence, education, sleep, subjective well-being, and neuroticism.

    "abstract": "The P-loop Walker A motif underlies hundreds of essential enzyme families that bind nucleotide triphosphates (NTPs) and mediate phosphoryl transfer (P-loop NTPases), including the earliest DNA/RNA helicases, translocases and recombinases. What were the primordial precursors of these enzymes? Could these large and complex proteins emerge from simple polypeptides? Previously, we showed that P-loops embedded in simple {beta} repeat proteins bind NTPs, but also, unexpectedly so, ssDNA and RNA. Here, we extend beyond the purely biophysical function of ligand binding to demonstrate rudimentary helicase-like activities. We further constructed simple 40-residue polypeptides comprising just one {beta}-(P-loop)- element. Despite their simplicity, these P-loop prototypes confer functions such as strand separation and exchange. Foremost, these polypeptides unwind dsDNA, and upon addition of NTPs, or inorganic polyphosphates, release the bound ssDNA strands to allow reformation of dsDNA. Binding kinetics and low-resolution structural analyses indicate that activity is mediated by oligomeric forms spanning from dimers to high-order assemblies. The latter are reminiscent of extant P-loop recombinases such as RecA. Overall, these P-loop prototypes comprise a plausible description of the sequence, structure and function of the earliest P-loop NTPases. They also indicate that multifunctionality and dynamic assembly were key in endowing short polypeptides with elaborate, evolutionarily relevant functions.\n\nSignificance statementIt is widely assumed that todays large and complex proteins emerged from much shorter and simpler polypeptides. Yet the nature of these early precursors remains enigmatic. We describe polypeptides that contain one of the earliest protein motifs, a phosphate-binding loop, or P-loop, embedded in a single beta-alpha element. These P-loop prototypes show intriguing characteristics of a primordial world comprised of nucleic acids and peptides. They are  generalists capable of binding different phospho-ligands, including inorganic polyphosphates and single-stranded DNA. Nonetheless, in promoting double-stranded DNA unwinding and strand-exchange they resemble modern P-loop helicases and recombinases. Our study describes a missing link in the evolution of complex proteins - simple polypeptides that tangibly relate to contemporary P-loop enzymes in sequence, structure and function.",

Bilateral decreases in thalamic beta (12-30Hz) activity were preferentially locked to stimulus presentation, and these decreases were greater when nonwords were read. Increased broadband gamma (70-150Hz) activity also was locked preferentially to speech onset bilaterally, but greater nonword-related increases in this activity were observed only on the left, demonstrating lateralization of thalamic gamma selectivity for lexical status. In addition, this lexical status effect was strongest in more anterior thalamic locations, regions which are more likely to receive pallidal than cerebellar afferents. These results provide evidence from intracranial thalamic recordings for the lateralization and topography of subcortical lexical status processing.",

This sensor for transiently-expressed proteins (STEP) is based on a fully matured but dim green fluorescent protein in which pre-existing fluorescence increases 11-fold in vivo following the specific and rapid binding of a protein tag (Kd 120 nM, kon 1.7 x 105 M-1s-1).
