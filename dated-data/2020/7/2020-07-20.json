    "abstract": "Ethnopharmacological RelevanceGastrointestinal anthrax, a disease caused by Bacillus anthracis, remains an important but relatively neglected endemic disease of animals and humans in remote areas of the Indian subcontinent and some parts of Africa. Its initial symptoms include diarrhea and stomachache. In the current study, several common plants indicated for diarrhea, dysentery, stomachache or as stomachic as per traditional knowledge in the Indian subcontinent, i.e., Aegle marmelos (L.) Correa (Bael), Allium cepa L. (Onion), Allium sativum L. (Garlic), Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (Neem), Berberis asiatica Roxb. ex DC. (Daruharidra), Coriandrum sativum L. (Coriander), Curcuma longa L. (Turmeric), Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (Bermuda grass), Mangifera indica L. (Mango), Morus indica L. (Black mulberry), Ocimum tenuiflorum L. (Ocimum sanctum L., Holy Basil), Ocimum gratissimum L. (Ram Tulsi), Psidium guajava L. (Guava), Zingiber officinale Roscoe (Ginger), were evaluated for their anti-Bacillus anthracis property. The usage of Azadirachta indica A. Juss. and Curcuma longa L. by Santals (India), and Allium sp. by biblical people to alleviate anthrax-like symptoms is well documented, but the usage of other plants is traditionally only indicated for different gastrointestinal disturbances/conditions.\n\nAim of the StudyEvaluate the above listed commonly available edible plants from the Indian subcontinent that are used in the traditional medicine to treat gastrointestinal diseases including those also indicated for anthrax-like symptoms for the presence of potent anti-B. anthracis activity in a form amenable to use by the general population in the endemic areas.\n\nMaterials and MethodsAqueous extracts made from fourteen plants indicated above were screened for their anti-B. anthracis activity using agar-well diffusion assay (AWDA) and broth microdilution methods. The Aqueous Garlic Extract (AGE) that displayed most potent anti-B. anthracis activity was assessed for its thermostability, stability under pH extremes encountered in the gastrointestinal tract, and potential antagonistic interaction with bile salts as well as the FDA-approved antibiotics used for anthrax control. The bioactive fractions from the AGE were isolated by TLC coupled bioautography followed by their characterization using GC-MS.\n\nResultsGarlic (Allium sativum L.) extract was identified as the most promising candidate with bactericidal activity against B. anthracis. It consistently inhibited the growth of B. anthracis in AWDA and decreased the viable colony-forming unit counts in liquid-broth cultures by 6-logs within 6-12 h. The AGE displayed acceptable thermostability (>80% anti-B. anthracis activity retained on incubation at 50{degrees}C for 12 h) and stability in gastric pH range (2-8). It did not antagonize the activity of FDA-approved antibiotics used for anthrax control. GC-MS analysis of the TLC separated bioactive fractions of AGE indicated the presence of previously unreported constituents such as phthalic acid derivatives, acid esters, phenyl group-containing compounds, steroids etc.\n\nConclusionThe Aqueous Garlic Extract (AGE) displayed potent anti-B. anthracis activity. It was better than that displayed by Azadirachta indica A. Juss. (Neem) and Mangifera indica L. while Curcuma longa L. (Turmeric) did not show any activity under the assay conditions used. Further work should be undertaken to explore the possible application of AGE in preventing anthrax incidences in endemic areas.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=161 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/162214v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@682faaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@114d64org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1efe980org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1caea0f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "How does the brain combine information predictive of the value of a visually guided task (incentive value) with information predictive of where task relevant stimuli may occur (spatial certainty)? Human behavioural evidence indicates that these two predictions may be combined additively to bias visual selection (additive hypothesis), whereas neuroeconomic studies posit that they may be multiplicatively combined (expected value hypothesis). We sought to adjudicate between these two alternatives. Participants viewed two coloured placeholders that specified the potential value of correctly identifying an imminent letter target if it appeared in that placeholder. Then, prior to the targets presentation, an endogenous spatial cue was presented indicating the targets more likely location. Spatial cues were parametrically manipulated with regards to the information gained (in bits). Across two experiments, performance was better for targets appearing in high versus low value placeholders and better when targets appeared in validly cued locations. Interestingly, as shown with a Bayesian model selection approach, these effects did not interact, clearly supporting the additive hypothesis. Even when conditions were adjusted to increase the optimality of a multiplicative operation, support for it remained. These findings refute recent theories that expected value computations are the singular mechanism driving the deployment of endogenous spatial attention. Instead, incentive value and spatial certainty seem to act independently to influence visual selection.",

    "abstract": "Structural priming is the tendency to repeat syntactic structure across sentences and can be divided into short-term (prime to immediately following target) and long-term (across an experimental session) components. This study investigates how non-declarative memory could support both the transient, short-term and the persistent, long-term structural priming effects commonly seen in the literature. We propose that these characteristics are supported by different subcomponents of non-declarative memory: Perceptual and conceptual non-declarative memory respectively. Previous studies have suggested that these subcomponents age differently, with only conceptual memory showing age-related decline. By investigating how different components of structural priming vary across the lifespan, we aim to elucidate how non-declarative memory supports two seemingly different components of structural priming. In 167 participants ranging between 20 and 85 years old, we find no change in short-term priming magnitude and performance on perceptual tasks, whereas both long-term priming and conceptual memory vary with age. We suggest therefore that the two seemingly different components of structural priming are supported by different components of non-declarative memory. These findings have important implications for theoretical accounts of structural priming.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is an age-related detrimental dementia. Amyloid beta peptides (A{beta}) play a crucial role in the pathology of AD. In familial AD, A{beta} is generated from the full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) via dysregulated proteolytic processing. However, A{beta} biogenesis in case of sporadic AD remains so far elusive. circRNAs are a class of transcripts, which are preferentially expressed in brain. Here, we identified a circRNA (circA{beta}-a) derived from the A{beta}-coding region of the APP gene. circA{beta}-a is expressed in brains of AD and nondementia controls. With the aid of our recently established approach for analysis of circRNA functions, we demonstrated that circA{beta}-a is efficiently translated into a novel A{beta}-related A{beta}175 protein in living cells. Importantly, A{beta}175 was further processed to A{beta} peptides, the hallmark of AD. In summary, our analysis revealed alternative route of A{beta} biogenesis. circA{beta}-a and its corresponding protein might represent novel therapeutic targets for AD treatment.",

    "abstract": "There is a great need to understand how and why biodiversity, which we define as the variety of organisms found in a given place, changes over time. Current estimates suggest strikingly slow change in traditional measures of biodiversity. These estimates seem to contradict rapid shifts in the abundance of individual species and have led to a rethinking of the mechanisms shaping biodiversity. Conceptual models emphasize the role of competition among species or, more recently, selection on species identity (i.e. selection that favors some species at the expense of others). However, it is difficult to quantify how these mechanisms contribute to biodiversity change. To illustrate this point we present cases where strong competition or selection on species identity leads to no biodiversity change. In view of this disconnect we develop a new approach to studying biodiversity change using the Price equation. We show that biodiversity change responds to selection on species rarity, rather than to either competition or selection on species identity. We then show how this insight can be used to quantify the effects of the mechanisms previously thought to influence biodiversity: 1) selection, 2) (ecological) drift, 3) immigration and 4) speciation. Our results suggest the connection between species fates and their rarity is fundamental to understanding biodiversity change.",

Deeper understanding of spatial heterogeneity and organization of tumor cells and their neighboring immune infiltrates within tumors could provide new insights into tumor progression and treatment response. Here we developed and applied computational approaches using digital whole slide images (WSIs) to investigate spatial heterogeneity and organization of regions harboring TMB-H tumor cells and TILs within tumors, and its prognostic utility. In experiments using WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas bladder cancer (BLCA), our findings show that WSI-based approaches can reliably predict patient-level TMB status and delineate spatial TMB heterogeneity and co-organization with TILs. TMB-H patients with low spatial heterogeneity enriched with high TILs show improved overall survival indicating a prognostic role of spatial TMB and TILs information in BLCA.",

    "abstract": "Humans show striking limitations in information processing when multitasking, yet can modify these limits with practice. Such limitations have been linked to a frontal-parietal network, but recent models of decision-making implicate a striatal-cortical network. We adjudicated these accounts by investigating the circuitry underpinning multitasking in 100 individuals and the plasticity caused by practice. We observed that multitasking costs, and their practice induced remediation, are best explained by modulations in information transfer between the striatum and the cortical areas that represent stimulus-response mappings. Specifically, our results support the view that multitasking stems at least in part from taxation in information sharing between the putamen and pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). Moreover, we propose that modulations to information transfer between these two regions leads to practice-induced improvements in multitasking.\n\nSignificance statementHumans show striking limitations in information processing when multitasking, yet can modify these limits with practice.

    "abstract": "The temporal molecular changes that lead to disease onset and progression in Alzheimers disease are still unknown. Here we develop a temporal model for these unobserved molecular changes with a manifold learning method applied to RNA-Seq data collected from human postmortem brain samples collected within the ROS/MAP and Mayo Clinic RNA-Seq studies. We define an ordering across samples based on their similarity in gene expression and use this ordering to estimate the molecular disease stage - or disease pseudotime - for each sample. Disease pseudotime is strongly concordant with the burden of tau (Braak score, P = 1.0x10-5), A{beta} (CERAD score, P = 1.8x10-5), and cognitive diagnosis (P = 3.5x10-7) of LOAD. Early stage disease pseudotime samples are enriched for controls and show changes in basic cellular functions. Late stage disease pseudotime samples are enriched for late stage AD cases and show changes in neuroinflammation and amyloid pathologic processes. We also identify a set of late stage pseudotime samples that are controls and show changes in genes enriched for protein trafficking, splicing, regulation of apoptosis, and prevention of amyloid cleavage pathways. In summary, we present a method for ordering patients along a trajectory of LOAD disease progression from brain transcriptomic data.",

    "abstract": "The human brain consists of functionally specialized areas, which flexibly interact and integrate forming a multitude of complex functional networks. However, the nature and governing principles of these specialized areas remain controversial: a distinct modular architecture versus a smooth continuum across the whole cortex. Here, we demonstrate a candidate governing principle ubiquitous in nature, that resolves this controversy for the brain at rest, during perception, cognition and action: functional harmonic modes. We calculated the harmonic modes of the brains functional connectivity, called \"functional harmonics\", from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in resting state of 812 participants. Each functional harmonic provides an elementary pattern of brain activity with a different spatial frequency. The set of all functional harmonics - ordered according to their spatial frequencies - can reconstruct any pattern of brain activity. The activity patterns elicited by 7 different tasks from the Human Connectome Project can be reconstructed from a very small subset of functional harmonics, suggesting a novel relationship between task and resting state brain activity. Further, the isolines of the continuous functional harmonic patterns delineate the borders of specialized cortical areas as well as somatotopic and retinotopic organization. Our results demonstrate a candidate scalable governing principle for functional brain organization, resolving the controversy between modular versus gradiental views, and demonstrate that a universal principle in nature also underlies human brain cortical organization.",

    "abstract": "Humans refer to their own mood state regularly in day-to-day as well as in clinical interactions. Theoretical accounts suggest that when reporting on our mood we integrate over the history of our experiences; yet, the temporal structure of this integration remains unexamined. Here we use a computational approach to quantitatively answer this question and show that early events exert a stronger influence on the reported mood compared to recent events. We show that a Primacy model accounts better for mood reports compared to a range of alternative temporal representations, and replicate this result across random, consistent or dynamic structures of reward environments, age groups and both healthy and depressed participants. Moreover, we find evidence for neural encoding of the Primacy, but not the Recency, model in frontal brain regions related to mood regulation. These findings hold implications for the timing of events in experimental or clinical settings and suggest new directions for individualized mood interventions.\n\nSignificanceHow we rate our own mood at any given moment is shaped by our experiences; but are the most recent experiences the most influential, as assumed by current theories? Using several sources of experimental data and mathematical modeling, we show that earlier experiences within a context are more influential than recent events, and replicate this finding across task environments, age groups, and in healthy and depressed participants. Additionally, we present neural evidence supporting this primacy model. Our findings show that delineating a temporal structure is crucial in modeling mood and this has key implications for its measurement and definition in both clinical and everyday settings.",

    "abstract": "Transfer across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) remains a significant hurdle for the development of biopharmaceuticals with therapeutic effects within the central nervous system. We established a functional selection method to identify high-affinity single domain antibodies to the transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) with efficient biotherapeutic delivery across the BBB.\n\nMethodsA synthetic phage display library based on the variable domain of new antigen receptor (VNAR) was used for in vitro selection against recombinant human TfR1 ectodomain (rh-TfR1-ECD) followed by in vivo selection in mouse for brain parenchyma penetrating antibodies. Phage formatted VNARs cross-reactive to recombinant human and mouse TfR1-ECD were fused to Fc domain of human IgG1 (hFc) and tested for TfR1-ECD binding by ELISA and surface plasmon resonance. The pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of VNAR-hFcs were studied in mice by ELISA and immunolabeling following intravenous (IV) injection and cardiac perfusion. Functional activity was measured by body temperature reduction following the IV injection of neurotensin fused to a TXB2-hFc (TXB2-hFc-NT).\n\nResultsTXB2 was identified as a high-affinity, species cross-reactive VNAR antibody against TfR1-ECD, that does not to compete with transferrin or ferritin for receptor binding. IV dosing of TXB2-hFc at 25 nmol/kg (1.875 mg/kg) in mice resulted in rapid binding to brain capillaries with subsequent transport into the brain parenchyma and specific uptake into TfR1-positive neurons. Likewise, IV dosing of TXB2-hFc-NT at 25 nmol/kg resulted in a rapid and reversible pharmacological response as measured by body temperature reduction. TXB2-hFc did not elicit any acute adverse reactions, bind or deplete circulating reticulocytes or reduce BBB-expressed endogenous TfR1 in mice. There was no evidence of target-mediated clearance or accumulation in peripheral organs except lung.\n\nConclusionsA species cross-reactive and brain-selective VNAR antibody to TfR1 was identified by a combination of in vitro and in vivo phage selection. As a high-affinity, bivalent Fc fusion protein, TXB2 rapidly crossed the BBB and exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic and safety profile and can be readily adapted to carry a wide variety of biotherapeutics from blood to brain.",

The organizational unit of their genome is the nucleoid, which consists of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and associated architectural proteins. Here, we show that phase separation is the primary physical mechanism for assembly and size-control of the mitochondrial nucleoid. The major mtDNA-binding protein TFAM spontaneously phase separates in vitro via weak, multivalent interactions into viscoelastic droplets with slow internal dynamics. In combination, TFAM and mtDNA form multiphase, gel-like structures in vitro, which recapitulate the in vivo dynamic behavior of mt-nucleoids. Enlarged, phase-separated, yet transcriptionally active, nucleoids are present in mitochondria from patients with the premature aging disorder Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) and are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

    "abstract": "Neuronal progenitors in the developing forebrain undergo dynamic competence states to ensure timely generation of specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subtypes from distinct neurogenic niches of the dorsal and ventral forebrain, respectively. Here we show evidence of progenitor plasticity when Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling is left unmodulated in the embryonic neocortex of the dorsal forebrain. At early stages of corticogenesis, loss of Suppressor of Fused (Sufu), a potent inhibitor of SHH signaling, in neocortical progenitors, altered their transcriptomic landscape. Ectopic activation of SHH signaling occurred, via degradation of Gli3R, resulting in significant upregulation of Fibroblast Growth Factor 15 (FGF15) gene expression. Consequently, activation of FGF signaling, and its downstream effector the MAPK signaling, facilitated expression of genes characteristic of ventral forebrain progenitors. Our studies identify the importance of modulating extrinsic niche signals such as SHH and FGF15 to maintain the competency and specification program of neocortical progenitors throughout corticogenesis.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTLow levels of FGF15 control progenitor proliferation and differentiation during neocortical development but little is known on how FGF15 expression is maintained. Our studies identified SHH signaling as a critical activator of FGF15 expression during corticogenesis. We found that Sufu, via Gli3R, ensured low levels of FGF15 was expressed to prevent abnormal specification of neocortical progenitors. These studies advance our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms guiding the generation of specific neocortical neuronal lineages, their implications in neurodevelopmental diseases, and may guide future studies on how progenitor cells may be utilized for brain repair.",

    "abstract": "Abstract:Chlamydia trachomatis (Ctr) is an obligate intracellular bacterium that undergoes a complex developmental cycle in which the bacterium differentiates between two functionally and morphologically distinct forms, the EB and RB, each of which expresses its own specialized repertoire of proteins. Both primary (EB to RB) and secondary (RB to EB) differentiation require protein turnover, and we hypothesize that proteases are critical for mediating differentiation. The Clp protease system is well conserved in bacteria and important for protein turnover. Minimally, the system relies on a serine protease subunit, ClpP, and a AAA+ ATPase, such as ClpX, that recognizes and unfolds substrates for ClpP degradation. In Chlamydia, ClpX is encoded within an operon 3 to clpP2. We present evidence that the chlamydial ClpX and ClpP2 orthologs are essential to organism viability and development. We demonstrate here that chlamydial ClpX is a functional ATPase and forms the expected homohexamer in vitro. Overexpression of a ClpX mutant lacking ATPase activity had a limited impact on DNA replication or secondary differentiation but, nonetheless, reduced EB viability with observable defects in EB morphology noted. Conversely, the overexpression of a catalytically inactive ClpP2 mutant significantly impacted developmental cycle progression by reducing the overall number of organisms. Blocking clpP2X transcription using CRISPR interference led to a decrease in bacterial growth, and this effect was complemented in trans by a plasmid copy of clpP2. Taken together, our data indicate that ClpX and the associated ClpP2 serve distinct functions in chlamydial developmental cycle progression and differentiation.\n\nImportance\n\nChlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of infectious blindness globally and the most reported bacterial sexually transmitted infection both domestically and internationally. Given the economic burden, the lack of an approved vaccine, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for treatment of infections, an understanding of chlamydial growth and development is critical for the advancement of novel, targeted antibiotics. The Clp proteins comprise an important and conserved protease system in bacteria. Our work highlights the importance of the chlamydial Clp proteins to this clinically important bacterium. Additionally, our study implicates the Clp system playing an integral role in chlamydial developmental cycle progression, which may help establish models of how Chlamydia spp. and other bacteria progress through their respective developmental cycles. Our work also contributes to a growing body of Clp-specific research that underscores the importance and versatility of this system throughout bacterial evolution and further validates Clp proteins as drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Because of their considerable number and diversity, membrane proteins and their macromolecular complexes represent the functional units of cells. Their quaternary structure may be stabilized by interactions between the -helices of different proteins in the hydrophobic region of the cell membrane. Membrane proteins also represent potential pharmacological targets par excellence for various diseases. Unfortunately, their experimental 3D structure and that of their complexes with intramembrane interacting partners are scarce due to technical difficulties. To overcome this key problem, we devised PPIMem, a computational approach for the specific prediction of higher-order structures of -helical transmembrane proteins. The novel approach involves identification of the amino acid residues at the interface of complexes with a 3D structure. The identified residues compose then interaction motifs that are conveniently expressed as mathematical regular expressions. These are used for motif search in databases, and for the prediction of intramembrane protein-protein complexes. Our template interface-based approach predicted 21, 544 binary complexes between 1, 504 eukaryotic plasma membrane proteins across 39 species. We compared our predictions to experimental datasets of protein-protein interactions as a first validation method. The PPIMem online database with the annotated predicted interactions is implemented as a web server and can be accessed directly at https://transint.shinyapps.io/transint/.",

    "abstract": "Reproducible, understandable models that can be reused and combined to true multi-scale systems are required to solve the present and future challenges of systems biology. However, many mathematical models are still built for a single purpose and reusing them in a different context can be challenging due to an inflexible monolithic structure, confusing code, missing documentation or other issues. These challenges are very similar to those faced in the engineering of large software systems. It is therefore likely that addressing model design at the software engineering level will also be beneficial in systems biology. To do this, researchers cannot just rely on using an accepted standard language. They need to be aware of the characteristics that make this language desirable and they need guidelines on how to utilize them to make their models more reproducible, understandable, reusable, and extensible. Drawing upon our experience with translating and extending a model of the human baroreflex, we therefore propose a list of desirable language characteristics and provide guidelines and examples for incorporating them in a model: In our opinion, a mathematical modeling language used in systems biology should be modular, human-readable, hybrid (i.e., support multiple formalisms), open, declarative, and support the graphical representation of models. We compare existing modeling languages with respect to these characteristics and show that there is no single best language but that trade-offs always have to be considered. We also illustrate the benefits of the individual language characteristics by translating a monolithic model of the human cardiac conduction system to a modular version using the modeling language Modelica as an example. Our experiment can be seen as emblematic for model reuse in a multi-scale setting. It illustrates how each characteristic, when applied consistently, can facilitate the reuse of the resulting model. We therefore recommend that modelers consider these criteria when choosing a programming language for any biological modeling task and hope that our work sparks a discussion about the importance of software engineering aspects in mathematical modeling languages.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella species are able to colonize a wide range of environments and include worrisome nosocomial pathogens. Here, we sought to determine the abundance and infectivity of prophages of Klebsiella to understand how the interactions between induced prophages and bacteria affect population dynamics and evolution. We identified many prophages in the species, placing these taxa among the top 5% of the most polylysogenic bacteria. We selected 35 representative strains of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex to establish a network of induced phage-bacteria interactions. This revealed that many prophages are able to enter the lytic cycle, and subsequently kill or lysogenize closely-related Klebsiella strains. Although 60% of the tested strains could produce phages that infect at least one other strain, the interaction network of all pairwise cross-infections is very sparse and mostly organized in modules corresponding to the strains capsule serotypes. Accordingly, capsule mutants remain uninfected showing that the capsule is a key factor for successful infections. Surprisingly, experiments in which bacteria are predated by their own prophages result in accelerated loss of the capsule. Our results show that phage infectiousness defines interaction modules between small subsets of phages and bacteria in function of capsule serotype. This limits the role of prophages as competitive weapons because they can infect very few strains of the species complex. This should also restrict phage-driven gene flow across the species. Finally, the accelerated loss of the capsule in bacteria being predated by their own phages, suggests that phages drive serotype switch in nature.",

These spatiotemporal patterns are believed to play a vital role in encoding sensory information. The olfactory system is a wellknown example where odor information is encoded in temporally evolving activity of the principal neurons and inhibitory interneurons play an important role in generating these patterns.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe rise of the Asian chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus in France has benefited the native community of parasitoids originally associated with oak gall wasps by becoming an additional trophic subsidy and therefore perturbing population dynamics of local parasitoids. However, the successful biological control of this pest has then led to significant decreases in its population densities. Here we investigate how the invasion of the Asian chestnut gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus in France and its subsequent control by the exotic parasitoid Torymus sinensis has impacted the local community of native parasitoids.\n\nWe explored 5 years of native community dynamics within 26 locations during the rise and fall of the invasive pest. In an attempt to understand how mechanisms such as local extinction or competition come into play, we analyzed how the patterns of co-occurrence between the different native parasitoid species changed through time.\n\nOur results demonstrate that native parasitoid communities experienced increased competition as the D. kuriphilus levels of infestation decreased. During the last year of the survey, two alternative patterns were observed depending on the sampled location: either native parasitoid communities were represented by an extremely limited number of species occurring at low densities, in some cases no native parasitoid species at all, or they were dominated by one main parasitoid: Mesopolobus sericeus. These two patterns seemed to correlate with the habitat type, M. sericeus being more abundant in semi-natural habitats compared to agricultural lands, the former known to be natural reservoirs for native parasitoids. These results highlight how the \"boom-and-bust\" dynamics of an invasive pest followed by successful biological control can deeply alter the structure of native communities of natural enemies.\n\nThis article has been peer-reviewed and recommended by Peer Community in Zoology https://doi.org/10.24072/pci.zool.100004",

    "abstract": "Different learning strategies are thought to fall along a continuum that ranges from simple, inflexible, and fast \"model-free\" strategies, to more complex, flexible, and deliberative \"model-based strategies\". Here we show that, contrary to this proposal, strategies at both ends of this continuum can be equally flexible, effective, and time-intensive. We analyzed behavior of adult human subjects performing a canonical learning task used to distinguish between model-free and model-based strategies. Subjects using either strategy showed similarly high information complexity, a measure of strategic flexibility, and comparable accuracy and response times. This similarity was apparent despite the generally higher computational complexity of model-based algorithms and fundamental differences in how each strategy learned: model-free learning was driven primarily by observed past responses, whereas model-based learning was driven primarily by inferences about latent task features. Thus, model-free and model-based learning differ in the information they use to learn but can support comparably flexible behavior.\n\nStatement of RelevanceThe distinction between model-free and model-based learning is an influential framework that has been used extensively to understand individual- and task-dependent differences in learning by both healthy and clinical populations. A common interpretation of this distinction that model-based strategies are more complex and therefore more flexible than model-free strategies. However, this interpretation conflates computational complexity, which relates to processing resources and generally higher for model-based algorithms, with information complexity, which reflects flexibility but has rarely been measured. Here we use a metric of information complexity to demonstrate that, contrary to this interpretation, model-free and model-based strategies can be equally flexible, effective, and time-intensive and are better distinguished by the nature of the information from which they learn. Our results counter common interpretations of model-free versus model-based learning and demonstrate the general usefulness of information complexity for assessing different forms of strategic flexibility.",

Combining computational vision models, fMRI experiment using a parametric-modulation approach, and natural image statistics of common objects, we depicted the neural distribution of a comprehensive set of visual features in VOTC, identifying voxel sensitivities to specific feature sets across geometry/shape, Fourier power, and color. The visual feature combination pattern in VOTC is significantly explained by their relationships to different types of response-action computation (Fight-or-Flight, Navigation, and Manipulation), as derived from behavioral ratings and natural image statistics.

A vast literature has explored their respective ecological drivers, sometimes generating correlations between them. Here we instead reveal a fundamental connection: both pyramids and cascades reflect the dynamical sensitivity of the food chain to changes in species intrinsic rates. We deduce a direct relationship between cascades and pyramids, modulated by what we call trophic dissipation - a synthetic concept that encodes the contribution of top-down propagation of consumer losses in the biomass pyramid. Predictable across-ecosystem patterns emerge when systems are in similar regimes of trophic dissipation. Data from 31 aquatic mesocosm experiments demonstrate how our approach can reveal the causal mechanisms linking trophic cascades and biomass distributions, thus providing a road map to deduce reliable predictions from empirical patterns.",

KIF5B plays a dominant role, whereas KIF13B helps Rab6 vesicles to reach freshly polymerized microtubule ends, to which KIF5B binds poorly, likely because its cofactors, MAP7-family proteins, are slow in populating these ends. Sub-pixel localization demonstrated that during microtubule plus-end directed transport, both kinesins localize to the vesicle front and can be engaged on the same vesicle. When vesicles reverse direction, KIF13B relocates to the middle of the vesicle, while KIF5B shifts to the back, suggesting that KIF5B but not KIF13B undergoes a tug-of-war with a minus-end directed motor.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing host transcriptional changes in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection will help delineate biological processes underlying viral pathogenesis. Comparison of expression profiles of lung cell lines A549 (infected with either SARS-CoV-2 (with ACE2 expression)) or Influenza A virus (IAV)) and Calu3 (infected with SARS-CoV-2 or MERS-CoV) revealed upregulation of the antiviral interferon signaling in all three viral infections. However, perturbations in inflammatory, mitochondrial, and autophagy processes were specifically observed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Validation of findings from cell line data revealed perturbations in autophagy and mitochondrial processes in the infected human nasopharyngeal samples. Specifically, downregulation of mTOR expression, mitochondrial ribosomal, mitochondrial complex I, and lysosome acidification genes were concurrently observed in both infected cell lines and human datasets. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection impedes autophagic flux by upregulating GSK3B in lung cell lines, or by downregulating autophagy genes, SNAP29 and lysosome acidification genes in human samples, contributing to increased viral replication. Therefore, drugs targeting lysosome acidification or autophagic flux could be tested as intervention strategies. Additionally, downregulation of MTFP1 (in cell lines) or SOCS6 (in human samples) results in hyperfused mitochondria and impede proper interferon response. Coexpression networks analysis identifies correlated clusters of genes annotated to inflammation and mitochondrial processes that are misregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Finally, comparison of age stratified human gene expression data revealed impaired upregulation of chemokines, interferon stimulated and tripartite motif genes that are critical for antiviral signaling. Together, this analysis has revealed specific aspects of autophagic and mitochondrial function that are uniquely perturbed in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has generated a global pandemic and no vaccine or antiviral drugs exist at the moment of writing. An attractive coronavirus drug target is the main protease (Mpro, also known as 3CLpro) because of its vital role in the viral cycle. A significant body of work has been focused on finding inhibitors which bind and block the active site of the main protease, but little has been done to address potential non-competitive inhibition which targets regions beyond the active site, partly because the fundamental biophysics of such allosteric control is still poorly understood. In this work, we construct an Elastic Network Model (ENM) of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro homodimer protein and analyse the dynamics and thermodynamics of the main proteases ENM. We found a rich and heterogeneous dynamical structure in the correlated motions, including allosterically correlated motions between the homodimeric proteases active sites. Exhaustive 1-point and 2-point mutation scans of the ENM and their effect on fluctuation free energies confirm previously experimentally identified bioactive residues, but also suggest several new candidate regions that are distant from the active site for control of the protease function. Our results suggest new dynamically-driven control regions as possible candidates for non-competitive inhibiting binding sites in the protease, which may assist the development of current fragmentbased binding screens. The results also provide new insight into the protein physics of fluctuation allostery and its underpinning dynamical structure.",

    "abstract": "Since the identification of SARS-CoV-2, a large number of genomes have been sequenced with unprecedented speed around the world. This marks a unique opportunity to analyze virus spreading and evolution in a worldwide context. Currently, there is not a useful haplotype description to help to track important and globally scattered mutations. Also, differences in the number of sequenced genomes between countries and/or months make it difficult to identify the emergence of haplotypes in regions where few genomes are sequenced but a large number of cases are reported. We propose an approach based on the normalization by COVID-19 cases of relative frequencies of mutations using all the available data to identify major haplotypes. Furthermore, we can use a similar normalization approach to tracking the temporal and geographic distribution of haplotypes in the world. Using 171 461 genomes, we identify five major haplotypes (OTUs) based on nine high-frequency mutations. OTU_3 characterized by mutations R203K and G204R is currently the most frequent haplotype circulating in four of the six continents analyzed. On the other hand, during almost all months analyzed, OTU_5 characterized by the mutation T85I in nsp2 is the most frequent in North America. Recently (since September), OTU_2 has been established as the most frequent in Europe. OTU_1, the ancestor haplotype is near to extinction showed by its low number of isolations since May. Also, we analyzed whether age, gender, or patient status is more related to a specific OTU. We did not find OTUs preference for any age group, gender, or patient status. Finally, we discuss structural and functional hypotheses in the most frequently identified mutations, none of those mutations show a clear effect on the transmissibility or pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Effective and economical measures are needed to either prevent or inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, in the upper respiratory tract. As fumigation of vinegar at low concentration (0.34%) ameliorated the symptoms of mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, we tested in vitro the potential antiviral activity of vinegar and of its active component, acetic acid. We here demonstrate that both vinegar and acetic acid indeed strongly inactivate SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in Vero cells. Furthermore, vinegar treatment caused a 90% inhibition of the infectious titer when directly applied to a nasopharyngeal swab transfer medium of a COVID-19 patient. These effects were potentiated if conduced at a temperature of 45 {degrees}C vs. 37 {degrees}C, a condition that is transiently generated in the upper respiratory tract during fumigation. Our findings are consistent and extend the results of studies performed in the early and mid-20th century on the disinfectant capacity of organic acids and can provide an affordable home-made aid to prevent or contain SARS-CoV-2 infection of the upper respiratory tract.",

    "abstract": "In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many life scientists are focused on SARS-CoV-2. To help them use available structural data, we systematically modeled all viral proteins using all related 3D structures, generating 872 models that provide detail not available elsewhere. To organise these models, we created a structural coverage map: a novel, one-stop visualization summarizing what is -- and is not -- known about the 3D structure of the viral proteome. The map highlights structural evidence for viral protein interactions, mimicry, and hijacking; it also helps researchers find 3D models of interest, which can then be mapped with UniProt, PredictProtein, or CATH features. The resulting Aquaria-COVID resource (https://aquaria.ws/covid) helps scientists understand molecular mechanisms underlying coronavirus infection. Based on insights gained using our resource, we propose mechanisms by which the virus may enter immune cells, sense the cell type, then switch focus from viral reproduction to disrupting host immune responses.\n\nSignificanceCurrently, much of the COVID-19 viral proteome has unknown molecular structure. To improve this, we generated [~]1,000 structural models, designed to capture multiple states for each viral protein. To organise these models, we created a structure coverage map: a novel, one-stop visualization summarizing what is -- and is not -- known about viral protein structure. We used these data to create an online resource, designed to help COVID-19 researchers gain insight into the key molecular processes that drive infection. Based on insights gained using our resource, we speculate that the virus may sense the type of cells it infects and, within certain cells, it may switch from reproduction to disruption of the immune system.",

To better understand the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and build up the host anti-viral immunity, we examined the levels of ACE2 expression on different types of immune cells including tissue macrophages. Flow cytometry demonstrated that there was little to no expression of ACE2 on most of the human peripheral blood-derived immune cells including CD4+ T, CD8+ T, activated CD4+ T, activated CD8+ T, CD4+CD25+CD127low/- regulatory T cells (Tregs), Th17 cells, NKT cells, B cells, NK cells, monocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and granulocytes. Additionally, there was no ACE2 expression (< 1%) found on platelets. Compared with interleukin-4-treated type 2 macrophages (M2), the ACE2 expression was markedly increased on the activated type 1 macrophages (M1) after the stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that high expressions of ACE2 were colocalized with tissue macrophages, such as alveolar macrophages found within the lungs and Kupffer cells within livers of mice. Flow cytometry confirmed the very low level of ACE2 expression on human primary pulmonary alveolar epithelial cells. These data indicate that alveolar macrophages, as the frontline immune cells, may be directly targeted by the SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore need to be considered for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

Both CA1- and CA3-APP-expressing transgenic mouse lines exhibited reduction in long-term potentiation (LTP) only when APP was expressed in neurons presynaptic to the recording site, whereas LTP remained comparable to wild-type mice when APP was expressed in postsynaptic neurons. As quantified by both light and electron microscopy, this orientation-specific impairment in synaptic plasticity was mirrored by synaptic loss in regions receiving axonal inputs from neurons expressing APP. Furthermore, A(plaque deposition also occurred only in the postsynaptic axonal fields of APP-expressing neurons. These deficits were reversed not only with doxycycline to inhibit APP expression but also with {gamma}-secretase and Fyn kinase inhibitors, supporting the interpretation that the observed synaptic injury was mediated by A{beta}. Taken together, these results demonstrate that APP/A{beta}-induced synaptic toxicity is preferentially initiated by signaling of presynaptically expressed APP to the postsynaptic compartment.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIn 2008, Bangladesh initiated Preventive Chemotherapy (PCT) for school-age children (SAC) through bi-annual school-based mass drug administration (MDA) to control Soil-Transmitted Helminth (STH) infections. In 2016, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfares Program on Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination and STH (ELFSTH) initiated district-level community impact assessments with Children Without Worms (CWW) using standardized, population-based sampling to measure the post-intervention STH burden across all ages ([&ge;] 1 yr) for the three STH species.\n\nMethods & Principal FindingsThe Integrated Community-based Survey for Program Monitoring (ICSPM) was developed by CWW and was used to survey 12 districts in Bangladesh from 2017 - 2020. We combined the individual demographic and parasite-specific characteristics from 10 districts and linked them with the laboratory data for collective analysis. Our analysis identified district-specific epidemiologic findings, important for program decisions.\n\nOf the 17,874 enrolled individuals, 10,824 (61%) provided stool samples. Overall, the prevalence of any STH species was substantially reduced to 14% from 79.8% in 2005. The impact was similar across all ages. STH prevalence was below 10% in 10 districts collectively, but remained high in 4 districts, despite their high reported PCT coverage in previous years. Among all, Bhola district was unique because it was the only district with high Trichuris prevalence.\n\nConclusionBangladesh successfully lowered STH prevalence across all ages despite targeting SAC only. Data from the survey indicate significant number of adults and pre-school age children (PSAC) were self-deworming with purchased pills. This may account for the flat impact curve across all ages. Overall prevalence varied across surveyed districts, with persistent high transmission in the northeastern districts and a district in the central flood zone, indicating possible service and ecological factors. Discrepancies in the impact between districts highlight the need for district-level data to evaluate program implementation after consistent high PCT coverage.\n\nAuthors SummaryBangladesh government conducted school-based mass drug administration (MDA) for over 10 years to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections. School-based evaluations of MDA indicate a reduction in STH burden among school-aged children (SAC). To further assess the impact on the community, Children Without Worms and the Ministry of Health and Family Welfares Program on Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination and STH (ELFSTH) initiated district-level community impact surveys in 12 districts. We share the results from the latter 10 districts here.\n\nOur analysis of 10,824 interviews and stool samples from 10 districts showed an estimated 14% of community members infected with at least one species of STH. This finding is substantially lower than the baseline STH prevalence (79.8%) estimated in 2005. Bangladeshs successful impact was achieved across all ages despite only treating SAC. Deworming source data showed significant numbers of adults and pre-school age children (PSAC) self-dewormed with locally purchased pills. Prevalence varied across the surveyed districts, with persistent high transmission in the northeastern districts and a district in the central flood zone, indicating possible ecological and service factors contributing to persistent infections. Discrepancies in the impact across districts highlights the need for sub-national level data to evaluate program performance fllowing consistent high intervention.",

    "abstract": "During neural circuit formation, axons navigate several choice points to reach their final target. At each one of these intermediate targets, growth cones need to switch responsiveness from attraction to repulsion in order to move on. Molecular mechanisms that allow for the precise timing of surface expression of a new set of receptors that support the switch in responsiveness are difficult to study in vivo. Mostly, mechanisms are inferred from the observation of snapshots of many different growth cones analyzed in different preparations of tissue harvested at distinct time points. However, to really understand the behavior of growth cones at choice points, a single growth cone should be followed arriving at and leaving the intermediate target.\n\nHere, we describe a spinal cord preparation that allows for live imaging of individual axons during navigation in their intact environment. The possibility to observe single growth cones navigating their intermediate target allows for measuring growth speed, changes in morphology, or aberrant behavior. Moreover, observation of the intermediate target - the floor plate - revealed its active participation and interaction with commissural axons during midline crossing.\n\nSummary statementLive tracking of single growth cones is more informative about axonal behavior during navigation than inference of behavior from the analyses of snapshots of different growth cones.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules (MTs) regulate numerous cellular processes, but their roles in brain morphogenesis are not well known. Here we show that CAMSAP3, a non-centrosomal microtubule regulator, is important for shaping the lateral ventricles. In differentiating ependymal cells, CAMSAP3 became concentrated at the apical domains, serving to generate MT networks at these sites. Camsap3-mutated mice showed abnormally narrow lateral ventricles, in which excessive stenosis or fusion was induced, leading to a decrease of neural stem cells at the ventricular and subventricular zones. This defect was ascribed at least in part to a failure of neocortical ependymal cells to broaden their apical domain, a process necessary for expanding the ventricular cavities. mTORC1 was required for ependymal cell growth but its activity was downregulated in mutant cells. Lysosomes, which mediate mTORC1 activation, tended to be reduced at the apical regions of the mutant cells, along with disorganized apical MT networks at the corresponding sites. These findings suggest that CAMSAP3 supports mTORC1 signaling required for ependymal cell growth via MT network regulation, and, in turn, shaping of the lateral ventricles.\n\nSummary statementCAMSAP3, which mediates non-centrosomal microtubule assembly, is required for mTORC1-dependent maturation of ependymal cells at the neocortex of developing mouse brains. Loss of CAMSAP3 causes deformation of the lateral ventricles.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery campaigns against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are beginning to target the viral RNA genome1, 2. The frameshift stimulation element (FSE) of the SARS-CoV-2 genome is required for balanced expression of essential viral proteins and is highly conserved, making it a potential candidate for antiviral targeting by small molecules and oligonucleotides3-6. To aid global efforts focusing on SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting, we report exploratory results from frameshifting and cellular replication experiments with locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), which support the FSE as a therapeutic target but highlight difficulties in achieving strong inactivation. To understand current limitations, we applied cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and the Ribosolve7 pipeline to determine a three-dimensional structure of the SARS-CoV-2 FSE, validated through an RNA nanostructure tagging method. This is the smallest macromolecule (88 nt; 28 kDa) resolved by single-particle cryo-EM at subnanometer resolution to date. The tertiary structure model, defined to an estimated accuracy of 5.9 [A], presents a topologically complex fold in which the 5' end threads through a ring formed inside a three-stem pseudoknot. Our results suggest an updated model for SARS-CoV-2 frameshifting as well as binding sites that may be targeted by next generation ASOs and small molecules.",

    "abstract": "The search for successful therapies of infections with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing. We tested inhibition of host cell nucleotide synthesis as a promising strategy to decrease the replication of SARS-CoV-2-RNA, thus diminishing the formation of virus progeny. Methotrexate (MTX) is an established drug for cancer therapy and to induce immunosuppression. The drug inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleotides. Strikingly, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by MTX in therapeutic concentrations around 1 M, leading to more than 1000-fold reductions in virus progeny in Vero C1008 (Vero E6) as well as Calu-3 cells. Virus replication was more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of MTX than of the established antiviral agent remdesivir. MTX strongly diminished the synthesis of viral structural proteins and the amount of released virus RNA. Virus replication and protein synthesis were rescued by folinic acid (leucovorin) and also by inosine, indicating that purine depletion is the principal mechanism that allows MTX to reduce virus RNA synthesis. The combination of MTX with remdesivir led to synergistic impairment of virus replication, even at 300 nM MTX. The use of MTX in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections still awaits further evaluation regarding toxicity and efficacy in infected organisms, rather than cultured cells. Within the frame of these caveats, however, our results raise the perspective of a two-fold benefit from repurposing MTX for treating COVID-19. Firstly, its previously known ability to reduce aberrant inflammatory responses might dampen respiratory distress. In addition, its direct antiviral activity described here would limit the dissemination of the virus.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEO_LIMTX is one of the earliest cancer drugs to be developed, giving rise to seven decades of clinical experience. It is on the World Health Organizations List of Essential Medicines, can be administered orally or parenterally, and its costs are at single digit {euro} or $ amounts/day for standard treatment. In case of its successful further preclinical evaluation for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections, its repurposing to treat COVID-19 would thus be feasible, especially under low-resource conditions.\nC_LIO_LIAdditional drugs exist to interfere with the synthesis of nucleotides, e.g. additional folate antagonists, inhibitors of GMP synthetase, or inhibitors of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). Such inhibitors have been approved as drugs for different purposes and might represent further therapeutic options against infections with SARS-CoV-2\nC_LIO_LIRemdesivir is currently the most established drug for treating COVID-19. Our results argue that MTX and remdesivir, even at moderate concentrations, can act in a synergistic fashion to repress virus replication to a considerably greater extent than either drug alone.\nC_LIO_LICOVID-19, in its severe forms, is characterized by pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and additional organ involvements. These manifestations are not necessarily a direct consequence of virus replication and cytopathic effects, but rather a result of an uncontrolled inflammatory and immune response. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as glucocorticoids are thus being evaluated for treating COVID-19. However, this bears the risk of re-activating virus spread by suppressing a sufficient and specific immune response. In this situation, it is tempting to speculate that MTX might suppress both excessive inflammation as well as virus replication at the same time, thus limiting both the pathogenesis of pneumonia and also the spread of virus within a patient.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The worldwide eruption of COVID-19 that began in Wuhan, China in late 2019 reached 10 million cases by late June 2020. In order to understand the epidemiological landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic, many studies have attempted to elucidate phylogenetic relationships between collected viral genome sequences using haplotype networks. However, currently available applications for network visualization are not suited to understand the COVID-19 epidemic spatiotemporally, due to functional limitations That motivated us to develop Haplotype Explorer, an intuitive tool for visualizing and exploring haplotype networks. Haplotype Explorer enables people to dissect epidemiological consequences via interactive node filters to provide spatiotemporal perspectives on multimodal spectra of infectious diseases, including introduction, outbreak, expansion, and containment, for given regions and time spans. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Haplotype Explorer by showing an example of its visualization and features. The demo using SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences is available at https://github.com/TKSjp/HaplotypeExplorer\n\nSummaryA lot of software for network visualization are available, but existing software have not been optimized to infection cluster visualization against the current worldwide invasion of COVID-19 started since 2019. To reach the spatiotemporal understanding of its epidemics, we developed Haplotype Explorer. It is superior to other applications in the point of generating HTML distribution files with metadata searches which interactively reflects GISAID IDs, locations, and collection dates. Here, we introduce the features and products of Haplotype Explorer, demonstrating the time-dependent snapshots of haplotype networks inferred from total of 4,282 SARS-CoV-2 genomes.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that seriously endangers human health. There is an urgent need to build physiological relevant human models for deep understanding the complex organ-level disease processes and facilitating effective therapeutics for COVID-19. Here, we first report the use of microengineered alveolus chip to create a human disease model of lung injury and immune responses induced by native SARS-CoV-2 at organ-level. This biomimetic system is able to reconstitute the key features of human alveolar-capillary barrier by co-culture of alveolar epithelial and microvascular endothelial cells under microfluidic flow. The epithelial cells on chip showed higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection than endothelial cells identified by viral spike protein expression. Transcriptional analysis showed distinct responses of two cell types to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including activated type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling pathway in epithelium and activated JAK-STAT signaling pathway in endothelium. Notably, in the presence of circulating immune cells, a series of alveolar pathological changes were observed, including the detachment of endothelial cells, recruitment of immune cells, and increased production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, IL-1{beta} and TNF-). These new findings revealed a crucial role of immune cells in mediating lung injury and exacerbated inflammation. Treatment with antiviral compound remdesivir could suppress viral copy and alleviate the disruption of alveolar barrier integrity induced by viral infection. This bioengineered human organ chip system can closely mirror human-relevant lung pathogenesis and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, not possible by other in vitro models, which provides a promising and alternative platform for COVID-19 research and preclinical trials.",

Here, we report the discovery of a novel, primate-specific isoform of ACE2, which we designate as deltaACE2 (dACE2). We demonstrate that dACE2, but not ACE2, is an ISG. In vitro, dACE2, which lacks 356 N-terminal amino acids, was non-functional in binding the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and as a carboxypeptidase. Our results reconcile current knowledge on ACE2 expression and suggest that the ISG-type induction of dACE2 in IFN-high conditions created by treatments, inflammatory tumor microenvironment, or viral co-infections is unlikely to affect the cellular entry of SARS-CoV-2 and promote infection.",

Bearing the largest single-stranded RNA genomes in nature, coronaviruses are critically dependent on long-distance RNA-RNA interactions to regulate the viral transcription and replication pathways. Here we experimentally mapped the in vivo RNA-RNA interactome of the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genome and subgenomic mRNAs. We uncovered a network of RNA-RNA interactions spanning tens of thousands of nucleotides. These interactions reveal that the viral genome and subgenomes adopt alternative topologies inside cells, and engage in different interactions with host RNAs. Notably, we discovered a long-range RNA-RNA interaction - the FSE-arch - that encircles the programmed ribosomal frameshifting element. The FSE-arch is conserved in the related MERS-CoV and is under purifying selection. Our findings illuminate RNA structure based mechanisms governing replication, discontinuous transcription, and translation of coronaviruses, and will aid future efforts to develop antiviral strategies.",

A pertinent and recent example where such strategy could be employed is in the fight against COVID-19. Therapies designed or discovered to target viral proteins also have off-target effects on the host proteome when employed in a complex physiological environment. This study aims to assess these host cell targets for a panel of FDA approved antiviral compounds including Remdesivir, using the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA(R)) coupled to mass spectrometry (CETSA MS) in non-infected cells. CETSA MS is a powerful method to delineate direct and indirect interactions between small molecules and protein targets in intact cells. Biologically active compounds can induce changes in thermal stability, in their primary binding partners as well as in proteins that in turn interact with the direct targets. Such engagement of host targets by antiviral drugs may contribute to the clinical effect against the virus but can also constitute a liability. We present here a comparative study of CETSA molecular target engagement fingerprints of antiviral drugs to better understand the link between off-targets and efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Naturally occurring allosteric protein switches have been repurposed for developing novel biosensors and reporters for cellular and clinical applications 1, but the number of such switches is limited, and engineering them is often challenging as each is different. Here, we show that a very general class of allosteric protein-based biosensors can be created by inverting the flow of information through de novo designed protein switches in which binding of a peptide key triggers biological outputs of interest 2. Using broadly applicable design principles, we allosterically couple binding of protein analytes of interest to the reconstitution of luciferase activity and a bioluminescent readout through the association of designed lock and key proteins. Because the sensor is based purely on thermodynamic coupling of analyte binding to switch activation, only one target binding domain is required, which simplifies sensor design and allows direct readout in solution. We demonstrate the modularity of this platform by creating biosensors that, with little optimization, sensitively detect the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, the hIgG1 Fc domain, the Her2 receptor, and Botulinum neurotoxin B, as well as biosensors for cardiac Troponin I and an anti-Hepatitis B virus (HBV) antibody that achieve the sub-nanomolar sensitivity necessary to detect clinically relevant concentrations of these molecules. Given the current need for diagnostic tools for tracking COVID-19 3, we use the approach to design sensors of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 protein epitopes and of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. The latter, which incorporates a de novo designed RBD binder, has a limit of detection of 15pM with an up to seventeen fold increase in luminescence upon addition of RBD. The modularity and sensitivity of the platform should enable the rapid construction of sensors for a wide range of analytes and highlights the power of de novo protein design to create multi-state protein systems with new and useful functions.",

Structure-based virtual screening efforts, fueled by a growing list of apo and inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV/CoV-2 Mpro crystal structures, are underway in many labs. However, little is known about the dynamic enzyme mechanism, which is needed to inform both structure-based design and assay development. Here, we apply Biodynamics theory to characterize the structural dynamics of substrate-induced Mpro activation, and explore the implications thereof for efficacious inhibition under non-equilibrium conditions. The catalytic cycle (including tetrahedral intermediate formation and hydrolysis) is governed by concerted dynamic structural rearrangements of domain 3 and the m-shaped loop (residues 132-147) on which Cys145 (comprising the thiolate nucleophile and one-half of the oxyanion hole) and Gly143 reside (comprising the other half of the oxyanion hole).

Understanding various aspects of SARS-CoV2 biology, virulence and pathogenesis as well as determinants of immune response have become a global research priority. In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses on SAR-CoV2 protein sequences, trying to unravel biologically important similarities between this newly emerged virus with other RNA viruses. Comparing the proteome of SARS-CoV2 with major positive and negative strand ssRNA viruses showed significant homologies between SARS-CoV2 spike protein with pathogenic paramyxovirus fusion proteins. This  spike-fusion homology was not limited to SARS-CoV2 and it existed for some other pathogenic coronaviruses; nonetheless, SARS-CoV2 spike-fusion homology was orders of magnitude stronger than homologies observed for other known coronaviruses. Moreover, this homology did not seem to be a consequence of general ssRNA virus phylogenetic relations. We also explored potential immunological significance of this spike-fusion homology. Spike protein epitope analysis using experimentally verified data deposited in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) revealed that the majority of spikes T cell epitopes as well as many B cell and MHC binding epitopes map within the spike-fusion homology region. Overall, our data indicate that there might be a relation between SARS-CoV2 and paramyxoviruses at the level of their surface proteins and this relation could be of crucial immunological importance.",

Antibiotics may be used but they also kill protective commensals and lack the physio-chemical properties to be specifically and optimally active in this complex milieu.

The enhanced activity is encoded in its tail fiber gene, whose protein product binds human heparan sulfated proteoglycans and localizes the phage to the epithelial cell surface, thereby positioning it near its bacterial host, a type of locational targeting mechanism.

    "abstract": "Therapies with new drugs have been appearing in tests worldwide as potential inhibitors of sars-cov-2 virus replication. Recently, one of these drugs, Ivermectin, was reported as an inhibitor of the nuclear import of HIV-1 proteins in vitro, soon becoming the target of an international prospecting work (not yet published), with patients tested for COVID-19. However, understanding the evolutionary aspects of the biological components involved in the complex drug-nuclear import helps in understanding how these relationships exist in the deactivation of viral infections. Thus, 153 sequences of the HIV-1 integrase gene were analyzed for their genetic structure and molecular diversity and the presence of two distinct groups for the Gene and not only one, was detected; As well as different degrees of structuring for each of these groups. These results support the interpretation of the lack of conservation of the HIV-1 gene and that the number of existing polymorphisms, only for this structure of the complex, implies the non-efficiency of a drug at population levels. Thus, the molecular diversity found in HIV-1 can be extrapolated to other viruses, such as Including, SARS-CoV-2 and the functionality of the drug, interacting with the integrase-importin complex, can be further decreased.",

    "abstract": "In every kingdom of life, GC->AT transitions occur more frequently than any other type of mutation due to the spontaneous deamination of cytidine. In eukaryotic genomes, this slow loss of GC base pairs is counteracted by biased gene conversion which increases genomic GC content as part of the recombination process. However, this type of biased gene conversion has not been observed in bacterial genomes so we hypothesized that GC->AT transitions cause a reduction of genomic GC content in prokaryotic genomes on an evolutionary time scale. To test this hypothesis, we used a phylogenetic approach to analyze triplets of closely related genomes representing a wide range of the bacterial kingdom. The resulting data indicate that genomic GC content is slowly declining in bacterial genomes where GC base pairs comprise 40% or more of the total genome. In contrast, genomes containing less than 40% GC base pairs have fewer opportunities for GC->AT transitions to occur so genomic GC content is relatively stable or actually increasing at a slow rate. It should be noted that this observed change in genomic GC content is the net change in shared parts of the genome and does not apply to parts of the genome that have been lost or acquired since the genomes being compared shared common ancestor. However, a more detailed analysis of two Caulobacter genomes revealed that the acquisition of mobile elements by the two genomes actually reduced the total genome content as well.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntensive farming practices can increase exposure of animals to infectious agents against which antibiotics are used. Besides leading to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), orally administered antibiotics are well known to cause dysbiosis. To counteract dysbiotic effects, numerous studies in the past two decades sought to understand whether probiotics are a valid tool to help re-establish a healthy gut microbial community after antibiotic treatment. However, although dysbiotic effects of antibiotics are well investigated, little is known about the effects of intramuscular antibiotic treatment on the gut microbiome and a few studies attempted to study treatment effects using phylogenetic diversity analysis techniques. In this study we sought to determine the effects of two probiotic- and one intramuscularly administered antibiotic treatment on the developing gut microbiome of post-weaning piglets between their 3rd and 9th week of life.\n\nMethodsShotgun metagenomic sequences from over 800 faecal time-series samples derived from 126 piglets and 42 sows were analysed in a phylogenetic framework to characterise the developing gut microbial community composition of post-weaning piglets. We assessed the effects of intramuscular antibiotic treatment and probiotic oral treatment on the diversity of these gut microbial communities using alpha and beta diversity measures.\n\nResultsDifferences between individual hosts such as breed, litter, and age, were found to be important contributors to variation in the community composition. Host age was the dominant factor in shaping the gut microbiota of piglets after weaning. The post-weaning pig gut microbiome appeared to follow a highly structured developmental program with characteristic post-weaning changes that can distinguish hosts that were born as little as two days apart in the second month of life. Treatment effects of the antibiotic and probiotic treatments were found but were subtle and included a higher representation of Mollicutes associated with intramuscular antibiotic treatment, and an increase of Lactobacillus associated with probiotic treatment.\n\nDiscussionThe discovery of correlations between experimental factors and microbial community composition is more commonly addressed with OTU-based methods and rarely analysed via phylogenetic diversity measures. The latter method, although less intuitive than the former, suffers less from library size normalization biases, and it proved to be instrumental in this study for the discovery of correlations between microbiome composition and host-, and treatment factors.",

While data in infected cells demonstrated Cp binding to the proposed genome packaging signal (PS), mutagenesis experiments showed that PS was not required for production of infectious SFV or Chikungunya virus. Instead, we identified multiple novel Cp binding sites that were enriched on gRNA-specific regions and promoted infectious SFV production and gRNA packaging. Comparisons of binding sites in cytoplasmic vs. viral nucleocapsids demonstrated that budding caused discrete changes in Cp-gRNA interactions. Notably, Cps top binding site was maintained throughout virus assembly, and specifically bound and assembled with Cp into core-like particles in vitro. Together our data suggest a new model for selective alphavirus genome recognition and assembly.",

    "abstract": "The transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) has emerged as one of several promising techniques for integrating multi-scale  omics data into traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Unlike GWAS, which associates phenotypic variance directly with genetic variants, TWAS uses a reference dataset to train a predictive model for gene expressions, which allows it to associate phenotype with variants through the mediating effect of expressions. Although effective, this core innovation of TWAS is poorly understood, since the predictive accuracy of the genotype-expression model is generally low and further bounded by expression heritability. This raises the question: to what degree does the accuracy of the expression model affect the power of TWAS? Furthermore, would replacing predictions with actual, experimentally determined expressions improve power? To answer these questions, we compared the power of GWAS, TWAS, and a hypothetical protocol utilizing real expression data. We derived non-centrality parameters (NCPs) for linear mixed models (LMMs) to enable closed-form calculations of statistical power that do not rely on specific protocol implementations. We examined two representative scenarios: causality (genotype contributes to phenotype through expression) and pleiotropy (genotype contributes directly to both phenotype and expression), and also tested the effects of various properties including expression heritability. Our analysis reveals two main outcomes: (1) Under pleiotropy, the use of predicted expressions in TWAS is superior to actual expressions. This explains why TWAS can function with weak expression models, and shows that TWAS remains relevant even when real expressions are available. (2) GWAS outperforms TWAS when expression heritability is below a threshold of 0.04 under causality, or 0.06 under pleiotropy. Analysis of existing publications suggests that TWAS has been misapplied in place of GWAS, in situations where expression heritability is low.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe compared the effectiveness of three methods for finding genetic effects on disease in order to quantify their strengths and help researchers choose the best protocol for their data. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) is the standard method for identifying how the genetic differences between individuals relate to disease. Recently, the transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) has improved GWAS by also estimating the effect of each genetic variant on the activity level (or expression) of genes related to disease. The effectiveness of TWAS is surprising because its estimates of gene expressions are very inaccurate, so we ask if a method using real expression data instead of estimates would perform better. Unlike past studies, which only use simulation to compare these methods, we incorporate novel statistical calculations to make our comparisons more accurate and universally applicable. We discover that depending on the type of relationship between genetics, gene expression, and disease, the estimates used by TWAS could be actually more relevant than real gene expressions. We also find that TWAS is not always better than GWAS when the relationship between genetics and expression is weak and identify specific turning points where past studies have incorrectly used TWAS instead of GWAS.",

    "abstract": "Target-based high-throughput compound screening dominates conventional one-drug-one-gene drug discovery process. However, the readout from the chemical modulation of a single protein is poorly correlated with phenotypic response of organism, leading to high failure rate in drug development. Chemical-induced gene expression profile provides an attractive solution to phenotype-based screening. However, the use of such data is currently limited by their sparseness, unreliability, and relatively low throughput. Several methods have been proposed to impute missing values for gene expression datasets. However, few existing methods can perform de novo chemical compound screening. In this study, we propose a mechanism-driven neural network-based method named DeepCE (Deep Chemical Expression) which utilizes graph convolutional neural network to learn chemical representation and multi-head attention mechanism to model chemical substructure-gene and gene-gene feature associations. In addition, we propose a novel data augmentation method which extracts useful information from unreliable experiments in L1000 dataset. The experimental results show that DeepCE achieves the superior performances not only in de novo chemical setting but also in traditional imputation setting compared to state-of-the-art baselines for the prediction of chemical-induced gene expression. We further verify the effectiveness of gene expression profiles generated from DeepCE by comparing them with gene expression profiles in L1000 dataset for downstream classification tasks including drug-target and disease predictions. To demonstrate the value of DeepCE, we apply it to patient-specific drug repurposing of COVID-19 for the first time, and generate novel lead compounds consistent with clinical evidences. Thus, DeepCE provides a potentially powerful framework for robust predictive modeling by utilizing noisy omics data as well as screening novel chemicals for the modulation of systemic response to disease.",

We conducted comparative analysis of publicly available whole-genome sequences of 64 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in Bangladesh and 371 isolates from another 27 countries to predict possible transmission routes of COVID19 to Bangladesh and genomic variations among the viruses. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the pathogen was imported in Bangladesh from multiple countries. The viruses found in the southern district of Chattogram were closely related to strains from Saudi Arabia whereas those in Dhaka were similar to that of United Kingdom and France. The 64 SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh belonged to three clusters. Compared to the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 sequence reported from China, the isolates in Bangladesh had a total of 180 mutations in the coding region of the genome, and 110 of these were missense. Among these, 99 missense mutations (90%) were predicted to destabilize protein structures. Remarkably, a mutation that leads to an I300F change in the nsp2 protein and a mutation leading to D614G change in the spike protein were prevalent in SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences, and might have influenced the epidemiological properties of the virus in Bangladesh.",

Environmental factors determine a pool of potential symbionts while host physiochemical factors influence how those microbes associate with distinct plant tissues.

Here we analyze epiphytic microbes from nine Hibiscus tiliaceus trees across a steep environmental gradient within a single Hawaiian watershed. At each location we sampled eight microhabitats: leaves, petioles, axils, stems, roots, and litter from the plant, as well as surrounding air and soil. While the composition of microbial communities is driven primarily by microhabitat, this variable predicted more than twice the compositional variance for bacteria compared to fungi. Fungal community compositional dissimilarity increased more rapidly along the gradient than did bacteria. Additionally, the spatial dynamics of fungal communities differed among plant parts, and these differences influenced the distribution patterns and range size of individual taxa. Within plants, microbes were compositionally nested such that aboveground communities contained a subset of the diversity found belowground. Our findings identify potential differences underlying the mechanisms shaping communities of fungi and bacteria associated with plants, and indicate an interaction between assembly mechanisms working simultaneously on different spatial scales.",

    "abstract": "Geothermal springs are barely affected by environmental conditions aboveground as they are continuously supplied with subsurface water with little variability in chemistry. Therefore, changes in their microbial community composition and function, especially over a long period, are expected to be limited but this assumption has not yet been rigorously tested. Toward closing this knowledge gap, we applied whole metagenome sequencing to 17 water samples collected between 2010 and 2016 (two to four samples per year) from the Thermopyles sulfur geothermal springs in central Greece. As revealed by 16S rRNA gene fragments recovered in the metagenomes, Epsilonproteobacteria-related operational taxonomic units (OTUs) dominated most samples, while grouping of samples based on OTU abundances exhibited no apparent seasonal pattern. Similarities between samples regarding functional gene content were high, especially in comparison to other surface water systems in Greece, with all samples sharing >70% similarity in functional pathways. These community-wide patterns were further confirmed by analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), which showed - in addition- that novel species and genera of the chemoautotrophic Campylobacterales order dominated the springs. These MAGs carried different pathways for thiosulfate and/or sulfide oxidation coupled to carbon fixation pathways. Overall, our study showed that even in the long term, functions of microbial communities in a moderately hot terrestrial spring remain stable, driving presumably the corresponding stability in community structure.",

We show that microbial communities used DNA only as a phosphorus source, and provision of other sources of carbon and nitrogen was needed to exhibit a substantial growth. The taxonomic composition of eDNA in the water column changed with the availability of inorganic phosphorus or supplied DNA, hinting at preferential uptake of eDNA from specific organismal sources. Especially favored for growth was eDNA from the most abundant taxa, suggesting some haloarchaea prefer eDNA from closely related taxa. Additionally, microcosms composition shifted substantially depending on the provided nutrient combinations. These shifts allowed us to predict supplemented nutrients from microbial composition with high accuracy, suggesting that nutrient availability in an environment could be assessed from a taxonomic survey of its microbial community.",

    "abstract": "Microbial life in the oceans impacts the entire marine ecosystem, global biogeochemistry and climate. The marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, an abundant component of this ecosystem, releases a significant fraction of the carbon fixed through photosynthesis, but the amount, timing and molecular composition of released carbon are still poorly understood. These depend on several factors, including nutrient availability, light intensity and glycogen storage. Here we combine multiple computational approaches to provide insight into carbon storage and exudation in Prochlorococcus. First, with the aid of a new algorithm for recursive filling of metabolic gaps (ReFill), and through substantial manual curation, we extended an existing genome-scale metabolic model of Prochlorococcus MED4. In this revised model (iSO595), we decoupled glycogen biosynthesis/degradation from growth, thus enabling dynamic allocation of carbon storage. In contrast to standard implementations of flux balance modeling, we made use of forced influx of carbon and light into the cell, to recapitulate overflow metabolism due to the decoupling of photosynthesis and carbon fixation from growth during nutrient limitation. By using random sampling in the ensuing flux space, we found that storage of glycogen or exudation of organic acids are favored when the growth is nitrogen limited, while exudation of amino acids becomes more likely when phosphate is the limiting resource. We next used COMETS to simulate day-night cycles and found that the model displays dynamic glycogen allocation and exudation of organic acids. The switch from photosynthesis and glycogen storage to glycogen depletion is associated with a redistribution of fluxes from the Entner-Doudoroff to the Pentose Phosphate pathway. Finally, we show that specific gene knockouts in iSO595 exhibit dynamic anomalies compatible with experimental observations, further demonstrating the value of this model as a tool to probe the metabolic dynamic of Prochlorococcus.",

    "abstract": "Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane of brown adipocyte. In the presence of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), UCP1 increases the proton conductance, which, in turn, increases fatty acid oxidation and energy release as heat. Several atomic models of UCP1 and UCP2 have been obtained by NMR in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC), a detergent known to inactivate UCP1. Based on NMR titration experiment on UCP1 with LCFA, it has been proposed that K56 and K269 are crucial for LCFA binding and UCP1 activation. Given the numerous controversies on the use of DPC for structure-function analyses of membrane proteins, we revisited those UCP1 mutants in a more physiological context by expressing them in the mitochondria of S. cerevisiae. Mitochondrial respiration, assayed on permeabilized spheroplasts, enables the determination of UCP1 activation and inhibition. The K56S, K269S and K56S/K269S mutants did not display any default in activation, which shows that the NMR experiments in DPC detergent are not relevant to understand UCP1 function.",

    "abstract": "1Recent advances in machine learning, bioinformatics and the understanding of the folding problem have enabled efficient predictions of protein structures with moderate accuracy, even for targets when there is little information from templates. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations provide a route to refine such predicted structures, but unguided atomistic simulations, even when lengthy in time, often fail to eliminate incorrect structural features that would allow the structure to become more energetically favorable owing to the necessity of making large scale motions and overcoming energy barriers for side chain repacking. In this study, we show that localizing packing frustration at atomic resolution by examining the statistics of the energetic changes that occur when the local environment of a site is changed allows one to identify the most likely locations of incorrect contacts. The global statistics of atomic resolution frustration in structures that have been predicted using various algorithms provide strong indicators of structural quality when tested over a database of 20 targets from previous CASP experiments. Residues that are more correctly located turn out to be more minimally frustrated than more poorly positioned sites. These observations provide a diagnosis of both global and local quality of predicted structures, and thus can be used as guidance in all-atom refinement simulations of the 20 targets. Refinement simulations guided by atomic packing frustration turn out to be quite efficient and significantly improve the quality of the structures.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, and the closely related SARS-CoV coronavirus enter cells by binding at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The stronger hACE2 affinity of SARS-CoV-2 has been connected with its higher infectivity. In this work, we study hACE2 complexes with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of the human SARS-CoV-2 and human SARS-CoV viruses, using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and Computational Protein Design (CPD) with a physics-based energy function. The MD simulations identify charge-modifying substitutions between the CoV-2 and CoV RBDs, which either increase or decrease the hACE2 affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The combined effect of these mutations is small, and the relative affinity is mainly determined by substitutions at residues in contact with hACE2. Many of these findings are in line and interpret recent experiments. Our CPD calculations redesign positions 455, 493, 494 and 501 of the SARS-CoV-2 RBM, which contact hACE2 in the complex and are important for ACE2 recognition. Sampling is enhanced by an adaptive importance sampling Monte Carlo method. Sequences with increased affinity replace CoV-2 glutamine by a negative residue at position 493, and serine by nonpolar, aromatic or a threonine at position 494. Substitutions at positions positions 455 and 501 have a smaller effect on affinity. Substitutions suggested by our design are seen in viral sequences encountered in other species, including bat and pangolin. Our results might be used to identify potential virus strains with higher human infectivity and assist in the design of peptide-based or peptidomimetic compounds with the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 binding at hACE2.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 and the earlier, closely related SARS-CoV virus bind at the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor at the cell surface. The higher human infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 may be linked to its stronger affinity for hACE2. Here, we study by computational methods complexes of hACE2 with the receptor binding domains (RBDs) of viruses SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. We identify residues affecting the affinities of the two domains for hACE2. We also propose mutations at key SARS-CoV-2 positions, which might enhance hACE2 affinity. Such mutations may appear in viral strains with increased human infectivity and might assist the design of peptide-based compounds that inhibit infection of human cells by SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Spontaneous mutations can alter tissue dynamics and lead to cancer initiation. While large-scale sequencing projects have illustrated processes that influence somatic mutation and subsequent tumour evolution, the mutational dynamics operating in the very early stages of cancer development are currently not well understood. In order to explore mutational dynamics in the early stages of cancer evolution we exploited neoplasia arising spontaneously in the Drosophila intestine. We analysed whole-genome sequencing data through the development of a dedicated bioinformatic pipeline to detect structural variants, single nucleotide variants, and indels. We found neoplasia formation to be driven largely through the inactivation of Notch by structural variants, many of which involve highly complex genomic rearrangements. Strikingly, the genome-wide mutational burden of neoplasia - at six weeks of age - was found to be similar to that of several human cancers. Finally, we identified genomic features associated with spontaneous mutation and defined the evolutionary dynamics and mutational landscape operating within intestinal neoplasia over the short lifespan of the adult fly. Our findings provide unique insight into mutational dynamics operating over a short time scale in the genetic model system, Drosophila melanogaster.",

Study 1 had 52 water samples obtained ad hoc from buildings in four metropolitan locations in different states in the US and a range of building types. Study 2 had 36 water samples obtained from two buildings in one metropolitan location with matched water sample types. One of the buildings had been continuously occupied, and the other substantially vacant for approximately 3 months. All water samples were analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing with a MinION from Oxford Nanopore Technologies. More than 127 genera of bacteria were identified, including genera with members that are known to include more than 50 putative frank and opportunistic pathogens. While specific results varied among sample locations, 16S rRNA amplicon abundance and the diversity of bacteria were higher in water samples from unoccupied buildings than normally occupied buildings as was the abundance of sequenced amplicons of genera known to include pathogenic bacterial members. In both studies Legionella amplicon abundance was relatively small compared to the abundance of the other bacteria in the samples. Indeed, when present, the relative abundance of Legionella amplicons was lower in samples from unoccupied buildings. Legionella did not predominate in any of the water samples and were found, on average, in 9.6% of samples in Study 1 and 8.3% of samples in Study 2.\n\nSynopsisComparison of microbial community composition in the plumbing of occupied and unoccupied buildings during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=102 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/209346v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e3b50borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@182ebc9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@45f69eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@142210f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Bradyrhizobia are common members of soil microbiomes and known as N2-fixing symbionts of economically important legumes. Many are also denitrifiers, which can act as sinks or sources for N2O. Inoculation with compatible rhizobia is often needed for optimal N2-fixation, but the choice of inoculant may also have consequences for N2O emission. Here, we analyzed the phylogeny and denitrification capacity of Bradyrhizobium strains, most of them isolated from peanut-nodules. All were dinitrifiers, but only ~1/3 could reduce N2O while most others were net N2O producers. The N2O-reducing isolates showed strong preference for N2O- over NO3--reduction. Such preference was also observed in a study of other bradyrhizobia and tentatively ascribed to competition between the electron pathways to Nap (periplasmic NO3- reductase) and Nos (N2O reductase). Another possible explanation is lower abundance of Nap than Nos. Here, proteomics revealed that Nap was instead more abundant than Nos, supporting the hypothesis that the electron pathway to Nos outcompetes that to Nap. In contrast, Paracoccus denitrificans, which has membrane-bond NO3- reductase (Nar), reduced N2O and NO3- simultaneously. We propose that the control at the metabolic level, favoring N2O reduction over NO3- reduction, applies also to other denitrifiers carrying Nos and Nap but lacking Nar.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementThis study extends the current knowledge on denitrification in bradyrhizobia, which mostly originates from studies of one model strain, by investigating the denitrification phenotypes of a diverse collection of Bradyrhizobium isolates. Only 1/3 of them could reduce N2O while the others were net sources for this potent greenhouse gas. All N2O-reducers showed strong preference for N2O over NO3-. We revealed by proteomics that this was not explained by differences in the abundances of Nap (periplasmic nitrate reductase) and Nos (N2O reductase), which strengthens our hypothesis (Mania et al., 2020) of a metabolic control mechanism by which Nos competes efficiently with Nap for electrons, making these organisms strong sinks for N2O. The findings highlight the potential importance of these organisms as N2O sinks in natural and agricultural ecosystems and pinpoint the need to take N2O reduction into account, along with N2-fixation effectiveness, when searching for strains suitable for production of inoculants.",

Here we study three breast-derived cell-lines with increased tumorigenicity (from MCF-10A to MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) and compared their miRNA sequences at the spliceosome fraction (SF). We report that the SF-miRNAs expression, identity, and pre-miRNA segmental composition vary across these cell-lines. The expression of the majority of the abundant SF-miRNAs (e.g. miR-100, miR-30a, and let-7 members) shows an opposite trend in view of the literature and breast cancer large cohorts. The results suggest that SF-miRNAs act in the nucleus on alternative targets than in the cytoplasm. One such miRNA is miR-7704 whose genomic position overlaps HAGLR, a cancer-related lncRNA. We found an inverse expression of miR-7704 and HAGLR in the tested cell lines. Moreover, inhibition of miR-7704 caused an increase in HAGLR expression. Furthermore, increasing miR-7704 levels attenuated the MDA-MB-231 cell-division rate. While miR-7704 acts as oncomiR in breast cancer patients, it has a tumor-suppressing function in SF, with HAGLR being its nuclear target. Manipulating miR-7704 levels is a potential lead for altering tumorigenicity. Altogether, we report on the potential of manipulating SF-miRNAs as an unexplored route for breast cancer therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "CrAssphage is the most abundant virus identified in the human gut virome and the founding member of a large group of bacteriophages that infect bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes and have been discovered by metagenomics of both animal-associated and environmental habitats. By analysis of circular contigs from human gut microbiomes, we identified nearly 600 genomes of crAss-like phages. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved genes demonstrates the monophyly of crAss-like phages, which can be expected to become a new order of viruses, and of 5 distinct branches, likely, families within that order. Two of these putative families have not been identified previously. The phages in one of these groups have large genomes (145-192 kilobases) and contain an unprecedented high density of self-splicing introns and inteins. Many crAss-like phages encode suppressor tRNAs that enable readthrough of UGA or UAG stop-codons, mostly, in late phage genes, which could represent a distinct anti-defense strategy. Another putative anti-defense mechanism that might target an unknown defense system in Bacteroidetes inhibiting phage DNA replication involves multiple switches of the phage DNA polymerase type between A and B families. Thus, comparative genomic analysis of the expanded assemblage of crAss-like phages reveals several unusual features of genome architecture and expression as well as phage biology that were not apparent from the previous crAssphage analyses.",

    "abstract": "Punctuated equilibrium is a mode of evolution in which phenetic change occurs in rapid bursts that are separated by much longer intervals of stasis during which mutations accumulate but no major phenotypic change occurs. Punctuated equilibrium has been originally proposed within the framework of paleobiology, to explain the lack of transitional forms that is typical of the fossil record. Theoretically, punctuated equilibrium has been linked to self-organized criticality (SOC), a model in which the size of  avalanches in an evolving system is power-law distributed, resulting in increasing rarity of major events. We show here that, under the weak-mutation limit, a large population would spend most of the time in stasis in the vicinity of saddle points in the fitness landscape. The periods of stasis are punctuated by fast transitions, in lnNe time (Ne, effective population size), when a new beneficial mutation is fixed in the evolving population, which moves to a different saddle, or on much rarer occasions, from a saddle to a local peak. Thus, punctuated equilibrium is the default mode of evolution under a simple model that does not involve SOC or other special conditions.\n\nSignificanceThe gradual character of evolution is a key feature of the Darwinian worldview. However, macroevolutionary events are often thought to occur in a non-gradualist manner, in a regime known as punctuated equilibrium, whereby extended periods of evolutionary stasis are punctuated by rapid transitions between states. Here we analyze a mathematical model of population evolution on fitness landscapes and show that, for a large population in the weak-mutation limit, the process of adaptive evolution consists of extended periods of stasis, which the population spends around saddle points on the landscape, interrupted by rapid transitions to new saddle points when a beneficial mutation is fixed. Thus, punctuated equilibrium appears to be the default regime of biological evolution.",

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses play an important role as pathogens of humans and animals, and the emergence of epidemics like SARS, MERS and COVID-19 is closely linked to zoonotic transmission events primarily from wild animals. Bats have been found to be an important source of coronaviruses with some of them having the potential to infect humans, with other animals serving as intermediate or alternate hosts or reservoirs. Host diversity may be an important contributor to viral diversity and thus the potential for zoonotic events. To date, limited research has been done in Africa on this topic, in particular in the Congo Basin despite frequent contact between humans and wildlife in this region. We sampled and, using consensus coronavirus PCR-primers, tested 3,561 wild animals for coronavirus RNA. The focus was on bats (38%), rodents (38%), and primates (23%) that posed an elevated risk for contact with people, and we found coronavirus RNA in 121 animals, of which all but two were bats. Depending on the taxonomic family, bats were significantly more likely to be coronavirus RNA-positive when sampled either in the wet (Pteropodidae and Rhinolophidae) or dry season (Hipposideridae, Miniopteridae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae). The detected RNA sequences correspond to 15 Alpha- and 6 Beta-coronaviruses, with some of them being very similar (>95% nucleotide identities) to known coronaviruses and others being more unique and potentially representing novel viruses. In seven of the bats, we detected RNA most closely related to sequences of the human common cold coronaviruses 229E or NL63 (>80% nucleotide identities). The findings highlight the potential for coronavirus spillover, especially in regions with a high diversity of bats and close human contact, and reinforces the need for ongoing surveillance.",

    "abstract": "Indigenous chicken farming is an important source of livelihood for rural families in Kenya. However, the farmers experience challenges including infections from poultry diseases such as Newcastle disease. Vaccination has been used over the years to provide immunity in flocks against disease outbreaks. However, Newcastle diseases virus (NDV) outbreaks are still reported among vaccinated flocks. This study examined the presence of Newcastle disease virus among vaccinated indigenous chicken (IC), in relation to weather (temperature, rainfall, humidity, wind speed), production system, and interspecies interaction. Samples were collected from flocks of indigenous chicken vaccinated with NDV vaccine from 68 households in six counties in Kenya (Bomet, Baringo, Kilifi, Nakuru, Kakamega, and Machakos). Some of the households (n=5 (9%) reported previous ND outbreaks. All the households had other mixed species of birds (ducks, geese, turkey, wild birds). The total number of samples collected was n=1210, oropharyngeal swabs-650, cloacal swab-650. The total number of the pooled sample was 246 pools. The samples were analysed by RT-qPCR targeting the NDV matrix gene. NDV matrix gene was detected in the pooled samples n=177(72%). Out of the positive samples, n=56(32%) were from vaccinated flocks, 91(51%) were from the cloacal swab and 86(49%) from the oropharyngeal swab. The samples were collected during varying weather (temperature, rainfall, humidity and wind speed). There was a statistical significance on the relationship between the presence of NDV and the Vaccination history (p=0.034); production system, (p=0.004), and month of sample collection (p<0.0001). However, there was no significance on the relationship between the presence of NDV and the interaction of IC and other birds. Failure to vaccinate IC results in the presence of the NDV. The free-range production system can have many cases of NDV due to the lack of biosecurity measures. Therefore, farmers should be advised to vaccinate their IC.",

    "abstract": "Spinal microglia are highly responsive to peripheral nerve injury and are known to be a key player in neuropathic pain. However, there has not been any direct evidence showing selective microglial activation in vivo is sufficient to induce chronic pain. Here we used optogenetic approaches in microglia to address this question employing CX3CR1creER/+: R26LSL-ReaChR/+ transgenic mice, in which red-activated channelrhodopsin (ReaChR) is inducibly and specifically expressed in microglia. We found that activation of ReaChR by red light in spinal microglia evoked reliable inward currents and membrane depolarization. In vivo optogenetic activation of microglial ReaChR in the spinal cord triggered chronic pain hypersensitivity lasting for 5-7 days. In addition, activation of microglial ReaChR upregulated neuronal c-fos expression and enhanced C-fiber responses. Mechanistically, ReaChR activation led to a reactive microglial phenotype with increased IL-1{beta} production. IL-1 receptor antagonist was able to reverse the pain hypersensitivity and neuronal hyperactivity induced by microglial ReaChR activation.\n\nTherefore, our work demonstrates that optogenetic activation of spinal microglia is sufficient to trigger chronic pain phenotypes by increasing neuronal activity via IL-1 signaling.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSurveillance is an essential component of global programs to eliminate infectious diseases and avert epidemics of (re-)emerging diseases. As the numbers of cases decline, costs of treatment and control diminish but those for surveillance remain high even after the  last case. Reducing surveillance may risk missing persistent or (re-)emerging foci of disease. Here, we use a simulation-based approach to determine the minimal number of passive surveillance sites required to ensure maximum coverage of a population at-risk (PAR) of an infectious disease.\n\nMethodology and Principal FindingsFor this study, we use Gambian human African trypanosomiasis (g-HAT) in north-western Uganda, a neglected tropical disease (NTD) which has been reduced to historically low levels (<1000 cases/year globally), as an example. To quantify travel time to diagnostic facilities, a proxy for surveillance coverage, we produced a high spatial-resolution resistance surface and performed cost-distance analyses. We simulated travel time for the PAR with different numbers (1-170) and locations (170,000 total placement combinations) of diagnostic facilities, quantifying the percentage of the PAR within 1h and 5h travel of the facilities, as per in-country targets. Our simulations indicate that a 70% reduction (51/170) in diagnostic centres still exceeded minimal targets of coverage even for remote populations, with >95% of a total PAR of ~3million individuals living [&le;]1h from a diagnostic centre, and we demonstrate an approach to best place these facilities, informing a minimal impact scale back.\n\nConclusionsOur results highlight that surveillance of g-HAT in north-western Uganda can be scaled back without substantially reducing coverage of the PAR. The methodology described can contribute to cost-effective and equable strategies for the surveillance of NTDs and other infectious diseases approaching elimination or (re-)emergence.\n\nAuthor SummaryDisease surveillance systems are an essential component of public health practice and are often considered the first line in averting epidemics for (re-)emerging diseases. Regular evaluation of surveillance systems ensures that they remain operating at maximum efficiency; systems that survey diseases of low incidence, such as those within elimination settings, should be simplified to reduce the reporting burden. A lack of guidance on how to optimise disease surveillance in an elimination setting may result in added expense, and/or the underreporting of disease. Here, we propose a framework methodology to determine systematically the optimal number and placement of surveillance sites for the surveillance of infectious diseases approaching elimination. By utilising estimates of geographic accessibility, through the construction of a resistance surface and a simulation approach, we identify that the number of operational diagnostic facilities for Gambian human African trypanosomiasis in north-western Uganda can be reduced by 70% with a minimal reduction in existing coverage, and identify the minimum number of facilities required to meet coverage targets. Our analysis can be used to inform the number and positioning of surveillance sites for diseases within an elimination setting. Passive surveillance becomes increasingly important as cases decline and active surveillance becomes less cost-effective; methods to evaluate how best to engage this passive surveillance capacity given facility capacity and geographic distribution are pertinent for several NTDs where diagnosis is complex. Not only is this a complicated research area for diseases approaching elimination, a well-designed surveillance system is essential for the detection of emerging diseases, with this work being topical in a climate where emerging pathogens are becoming more commonplace.",

    "abstract": "Water is vital for the survival of any species because of its key role in most physiological processes. However, little is known about the non-food-related water sources exploited by arboreal mammals, the seasonality of their drinking behavior and its potential drivers (including diet composition, temperature, and rainfall). We investigated this subject in 14 wild groups of brown howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba clamitans) inhabiting small, medium, and large Atlantic Forest fragments in southern Brazil. We found a wide variation in the mean rate of drinking among groups (range=0-16 records/day). Streams (44% of 1,258 records) and treeholes (26%) were the major types of water sources, followed by bromeliads in the canopy (16%), pools (11%), and rivers (3%). The type of source influenced whether howlers used a hand to access the water or not. Drinking tended to be evenly distributed throughout the year, except for a slightly lower number of records in the spring than in the other seasons, but it was unevenly distributed during the day. It increased in the afternoon in all groups, particularly during temperature peaks around 15:00 and 17:00. We found via generalized linear mixed modelling that the daily frequency of drinking was mainly influenced by flower (negatively) and leaf (positively) consumption, whereas fruit consumption, fragment size, rainfall, and mean ambient temperature played negligible roles. The influence of leaf consumption is compatible with the  metabolite detoxification hypothesis, which states that the processing of this fibrous food requires the ingestion of larger volumes of water to help in the detoxification/excretion of its metabolites. In sum, we found that irrespective of habitat size and climatic conditions, brown howlers seem to seek a positive water balance by complementing preformed and metabolic water with drinking water, even when it is associated with a high predation risk in terrestrial sources.",

HHV-6 has been linked to the development of multiple diseases, among them - autoimmune. Conflicting evidence implicates HHV-6 in autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT). HHV-6 contains two genes (U12 and U51) that encode putative homologues of human G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) like CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5. It has been shown that proteins encoded by HHV-6 U12 and U51 genes can be expressed on the surface of epithelial and some peripheral blood mononuclear cells populations, which makes them a potential cause for evoking autoimmunity.\n\nThe aim of this study was to identify potentially immunogenic synthetic peptides derived from HHV-6 U12 and U51 amino acid sequences and to find evidences of the possible involvement of these proteins in AIT development. 62 AIT patients positive for HHV-6 infection were enrolled in this study. 30 different synthetic peptides designed from HHV-6 U12 and U51 proteins amino acid sequences, as well as, recombinant human CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5 proteins were used for suspension multiplex immunological assay (SMIA) to detect specific IgG, and IgM antibodies.\n\nHHV-6 peptide specific IgG and IgM antibodies were found in patients samples, with higher signals for IgM antibodies, which is indicative of reactivation and active HHV-6 infection. As well recombinant CCR1 and CCR5 showed high signals on IgM antibodies which is indicating on the presence of potential auto-antibodies against human G protein-coupled receptors. No cross reactivity between HHV-6 peptide specific antibodies and human recombinant CCR1, CCR3 and CCR5 was found, however, the possibility of cross-reactive autoantibodies specific for structural epitopes cannot be excluded.",

Neuronal processes are typically segmented by region and modality in order to explain an experimental observation at a given scale, but integrative frameworks linking scales and modalities are scarce. Here, we present a set of functional requirements used to evaluate the recently developed large-scale brain model against a learning task involving coordinated learning between cortical and sub-cortical systems. The original Information Based Exchange Brain model (IBEx) is decomposed into functionally relevant subsystems, and each subsystem is analyzed and tuned independently and with regard to its relevant functional requirements. Intermediate conclusions are made for each subsystems according to the constraints imposed by these requirements. Subsystems are then re-introduced into the global framework. The relationship between the global framework and phenotypes associated with Huntingtons disease is then discussed and the framework considered in the context of other state-of-the-art integrative brain models.",

Some hypotheses argue that these two modes of cognitive functioning are irreducible, reflecting distinct mental operations underlain by separate neural bases; Others ascribe both to a unitary neural system dedicated to long-timescale information. We addressed this question by employing inter-subject measures to investigate the stimulus-induced neural responses when participants were listening to narrative and argumentative texts during fMRI. We found that following both kinds of texts enhanced functional couplings within the frontoparietal control system. However, while a narrative specifically implicated the default mode system, an argument specifically induced synchronization between the intraparietal sulcus in the frontoparietal control system and multiple perisylvian areas in the language system. Our findings reconcile the two hypotheses by revealing commonalities and differences between the narrative and the argumentative brain networks, showing how diverse mental activities arise from the segregation and integration of the existing brain systems.",

However, it is largely unknown how much underlying microscopic variability is compatible with normal development. Here, we quantified embryo-to-embryo variability in vertebrate development, by studying cell number variation in the zebrafish endoderm. We noticed that the size of a sub-population of the endoderm, the dorsal forerunner cells (which later form the left-right organizer), exhibits significantly more embryo-to-embryo variation than the rest of the endoderm. We found that, when incubated at elevated temperature, the frequency of left-right laterality defects is increased drastically in embryos with a low number of dorsal forerunner cells. Furthermore, we observed that these fluctuations have a large stochastic component among fish of the same genetic background. Hence, a stochastic variation in early development leads to a remarkably strong macroscopic phenotype. These fluctuations appear to be associated with maternal effects in the specification of the dorsal forerunner cells.",

    "abstract": "Bayesian phylogeography aims to reconstruct migrations in evolutionary processes. This methodological framework has been used for the reconstruction of homelands and historical expansions of various language families, but its reliability for language diversification research has remained unclear. We contribute to this discussion with a simulation study where we distinguish two types of spatial processes: migration and expansion. By migration we denote long-distance movement of whole populations, leaving their previous habitat empty. Expansions are small-scale movements of speakers or inclusions of new speakers into the language community, cumulatively contributing to a gradual spread into new territories. We simulate migrations, in the form of directional random walks, and expansions, in the form of a grid-based region-growing process. We run both simulation scenarios with varying degrees of directional trends and evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art phylogeographic methods. Our results show that phylogeography fails to reconstruct migrations, but works surprisingly well on expansions, even under severe directional trends. We demonstrate that migrations and expansions have typical phylogenetic and spatial patterns, which in the one case inhibit and in the other facilitate phylogeographic reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose descriptive statistics to identify whether a real sample of languages (Bantu), their relationship and spatial distribution, better fits a migration or an expansion scenario. Bringing together the results of the simulation study and theoretical arguments, we make recommendations for judging the adequacy of phylogeographic models to reconstruct the spatial evolution of languages.",

    "abstract": "Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified many loci exhibiting small but statistically significant associations with complex traits and disease risk. However, control of population stratification continues to be a limiting factor, particularly when calculating polygenic scores where subtle biases can cumulatively lead to large errors. We simulated GWAS under realistic models of demographic history to study the effect of residual stratification in large GWAS. We show that when population structure is recent, it cannot be fully corrected using principal components based on common variants--the standard approach--because common variants are uninformative about recent demographic history. Consequently, polygenic scores calculated from such GWAS results are biased in that they recapitulate non-genetic environmental structure. Principal components calculated from rare variants or identity-by-descent segments largely correct for this structure if environmental effects are smooth. However, even these corrections are not effective for local or batch effects. While sibling-based association tests are immune to stratification, the hybrid approach of ascertaining variants in a standard GWAS and then re-estimating effect sizes in siblings reduces but does not eliminate bias. Finally, we show that rare variant burden tests are relatively robust to stratification. Our results demonstrate that the effect of population stratification on GWAS and polygenic scores depends not only on the frequencies of tested variants and the distribution of environmental effects but also on the demographic history of the population.",

    "abstract": "The neurodevelopmental phenotype in Down Syndrome (DS), or Trisomy 21, is variable including a wide spectrum of cognitive impairment and a high risk of early-onset Alzheimers disease (AD). A key metabolite of interest within the brain in DS is Myo-inositol (Myo-ins). The NA+/Myo-ins co-transporter, is located on human chromosome 21 and is overexpressed in DS. In adults with DS, elevated brain Myo-ins has previously been associated with cognitive impairment and proposed as a risk marker for progression to AD. However, it is unknown if brain Myo-ins is increased earlier in development.\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess Myo-ins and key brain metabolites [N-acetylaspartate (NAA), Choline (Cho) and Creatine(Cr)] in the developing brain in DS and aged-matched controls. To achieve this we used mass spectrometry in early (10-20 weeks post conception) ex vivo fetal brain tissue samples from DS (n=14) and control (n=30) cases; and in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in neonates with DS (n=18) and aged matched controls (n= 25) scanned just after birth (36-45 weeks postmenstrual age.\n\nWe observed elevated Myo-ins in the ex vivo fetal cortical brain tissue in DS compared with controls. Relative to reference metabolites Cho and Cr, we also detected elevated ratios of Myo-ins and NAA in vivo in the basal ganglia and thalami, in neonates with DS, when compared to age-matched typically developing controls. Thus, a higher level of brain Myo-ins was evident as early as 10 weeks post conception and was measurable in vivo from 36 weeks post-menstrual age. Future work will determine if this early difference in metabolites is linked to cognitive outcomes in childhood or has utility as a potential treatment biomarker for early intervention.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication (WGD) events have played a major role in eukaryotic genome evolution, but the consequence of these extreme events in adaptive genome evolution is still not well understood. To address this knowledge gap we used a comparative phylogenetic model and transcriptomic data from seven species to infer selection on gene expression in duplicated genes (ohnologs) following the salmonid WGD 80-100 million years ago. We find rare cases of tissue-specific expression evolution but pervasive expression evolution affecting many tissues, reflecting strong selection on maintenance of genome stability following genome doubling. Although ohnolog expression levels have evolved mostly asymmetrically, by diverting one ohnolog copy down a path towards pseudogenization, strong evolutionary constraints have frequently also favoured symmetric shifts in gene dosage of both copies, likely to achieve gene dose reduction while avoiding accumulation of  toxic mutations. Mechanistically, ohnolog regulatory divergence is dictated by the number of bound transcription factors in promoters, with transposable elements being one source of novel binding sites driving tissue-specific gains in expression. Our results imply pervasive adaptive expression evolution following WGD to overcome the immediate challenges posed by genome doubling and to exploit the long-term genetic opportunities for novel phenotype evolution.",

    "abstract": "Speed-accuracy tradeoffs - being fast at the risk of being wrong - are fundamental to many decisions and natural selection is expected to resolve these tradeoffs according to the costs and benefits of behavior. We here test the prediction that females and males should integrate information from courtship signals differently because they experience different payoffs along the speed-accuracy continuum. We fitted a neural model of decision making (a drift-diffusion model of integration to threshold) to behavioral data from the grasshopper Chorthippus biguttulus to determine the parameters of temporal integration of acoustic directional information used by male grasshoppers to locate receptive females. The model revealed that males had a low threshold for initiating a turning response, yet a large integration time constant enabled them to continue to gather information when cues were weak. This contrasts with parameters estimated for females of the same species when evaluating potential mates, in which response thresholds were much higher and behavior was strongly influenced by unattractive stimuli. Our results reveal differences in neural integration consistent with the sex-specific costs of mate search: Males often face competition and need to be fast, while females often pay high error costs and need to be deliberate.",
