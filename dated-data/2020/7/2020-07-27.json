    "abstract": "CRISPR based interference has become common in various applications from genetic circuits to dynamic metabolic control. In E. coli the native CRISPR Cascade system can be utilized for silencing by deletion of the cas3 nuclease along with expression of guide RNA arrays, where multiple genes can be silenced from a single transcript. We notice the loss of protospacer sequences from guide arrays utilized for dynamic silencing. We report that unstable guide arrays are due to expression of the Cas1/2 endonuclease complex. A cas1 deletion improves guide array stability. We propose a model wherein basal Cas1/2 endonuclease activity results in the loss of protospacers from guide arrays. Subsequently, mutant guide arrays can be amplified through selection. Replacing a constitutive promoter driving Cascade complex expression with a tightly controlled inducible promoter improves guide array stability, while minimizing leaky gene silencing.\n\nHighlightsO_LICas1/2 endonuclease complex mediates CRISPR/Cascade protospacer loss in E. coli\nC_LIO_LITightly controlled Cascade operon expression increases guide array stability.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FHSD), a fundamentally complex muscle disorder that thus far remains untreatable. As the name implies, FSHD starts in the muscles of the face and shoulder gridle. The main perturbator of the disease is the pioneer transcription factor DUX4, which is misexpressed in affected tissues due to a failure in epigenetic repressive mechanisms. In pursuit of unraveling the underlying mechanism of FSHD and finding potential therapeutic targets or treatment options, we performed an exhaustive genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 phenotypic rescue screen to identify modulators of DUX4 cytotoxicity. We found no key effectors other than DUX4 itself, suggesting treatment efforts in FSHD should be directed towards its direct modulation.\n\nThe screen did however reveal some rare and unexpected Cas9-induced genomic events, that may provide important considerations for planning future CRISPR/Cas9 knock-out screens.",

    "abstract": "Nanocontainers or macromolecular scaffolds for artificial biocatalytic cascades facilitate sequential enzyme reactions but diffusive escape of intermediates limits rate enhancement. Nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS) naturally form gigantic assembly lines and prevent escape by covalently tethering intermediates. Here, we have built DNA-templated NRPS (DT-NRPS) by adding zinc finger tags to split NRPS modules. The zinc fingers direct the NRPS modules to 9-bp binding sites on a DNA strand, where they form a catalytically active enzyme cascade. DT-NRPS outperform previously reported DNA templated enzyme cascades in terms of DNA acceleration which demonstrates that covalent intermediate channeling is possible along the DNA template. Attachment of assembly line enzymes to a DNA scaffold is a promising catalytic strategy for the sequence-controlled biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides and other polymers.",

    "abstract": "Cell-intrinsic immune mechanisms control intracellular pathogens that infect eukaryotes. The intracellular pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) evolved to withstand cell-autonomous immunity to cause persistent infections and disease. A potent inducer of cell-autonomous immunity is the lymphocyte-derived cytokine IFN{gamma}. While the production of IFN{gamma} by T cells is essential to protect against Mtb, it is not capable of fully eradicating Mtb infection. This suggests that Mtb evades a subset of IFN{gamma}-mediated antimicrobial responses, yet what mechanisms Mtb resists remains unclear. The IFN{gamma}-inducible Guanylate binding proteins (GBPs) are key host defense proteins able to control infections with intracellular pathogens. GBPs were previously shown to directly restrict Mycobacterium bovis BCG yet their role during Mtb infection has remained unknown. Here, we examine the importance of a cluster of five GBPs on mouse chromosome 3 in controlling Mycobacterial infection. While M. bovis BCG is directly restricted by GBPs, we find that the GBPs on chromosome 3 do not contribute to the control of Mtb replication or the associated host response to infection. The differential effects of GBPs during Mtb versus M. bovis BCG infection is at least partially explained by the absence of the ESX1 secretion system from M. bovis BCG, since Mtb mutants lacking the ESX1 secretion system become similarly susceptible to GBP-mediated immune defense. Therefore, this specific genetic interaction between the murine host and Mycobacteria reveals a novel function for the ESX1 virulence system in the evasion of GBP-mediated immunity.",

    "abstract": "Orb-web weaving spiders and their relatives spin multiple task-specific fiber types. The unique material properties of each silk type result from differences in amino acid sequence and structure of their component proteins, primarily spidroins (spider fibrous proteins). Amino acid content and gene expression measurements of spider silks suggest some spiders change expression patterns of individual protein components in response to environmental cues. We quantified mRNA abundance of three spidroin encoding genes involved in prey capture in the common house spider, Parasteatoda tepidariorum (Theridiidae), fed different diets. After 10 days of acclimation to the lab on a diet of mealworms, spiders were split into three groups: (1) individuals were immediately dissected, (2) spiders were fed high-energy crickets, or (3) spiders were fed low-energy flies, for 1 month. All spiders gained mass during the acclimation period and cricket-fed spiders continued to gain mass, while fly fed spiders either maintained or lost mass. Using quantitative PCR, we found no significant differences in the absolute or relative abundance of dragline gene transcripts, major ampullate spidroin 1 (MaSp1) and major ampullate spidroin 2 (MaSp2), among groups. In contrast, prey-wrapping minor ampullate spidroin (MiSp) gene transcripts were significantly less abundant in fly-fed than lab-acclimated spiders. However, when measured relative to actin, cricket-fed spiders showed the lowest expression of MiSp. Our results suggest that house spiders are able to maintain silk production, even in the face of a low-quality diet.",

Using a comparative infection model, we sequenced the splenic CD4+ T-cell receptor repertoires generated over the time-course of a Plasmodium chabaudi infection. We show through repeat replicate experiments, single-cell RNA-seq, and analyses of independent RNA-seq data, that following a first infection - within a highly polyclonal expansion - T-effector repertoires are consistently dominated by TRBV3 gene usage. Clustering by sequence similarity, we find the same dominant clonal signature is expanded across replicates in the acute phase of an infection, revealing a conserved pathogen-specific T-cell response that is consistently a hallmark of a first infection, but not expanded upon re-challenge. Determining the host or parasite factors driving this conserved response may uncover novel immune targets for malaria therapeutic purposes.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we investigated the impact of treated wastewater (TWW) irrigation on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in subsoil pore-water, a so-far under-appreciated matrix. We hypothesized that TWW irrigation increases ARG prevalence in subsoil pore-water. This hypothesis was tested using a multiphase approach, which consisted of sampling percolated subsoil pore-water from lysimeter-wells of a real-scale TWW-irrigated field, operated for commercial farming practices, and controlled, laboratory mesocosms irrigated with freshwater or TWW. We monitored the abundance of six selected ARGs (sul1, blaOXA-58, tetM, qnrS, blaCTX-M-32 and blaTEM), the intI1 gene associated with mobile genetic elements and an indicator for anthropogenic pollution and bacterial abundance (16S rRNA gene) by qPCR. The bacterial load of subsoil pore water was independent of both, irrigation intensity in the field study and irrigation water type in the mesocosms. Among the tested genes in the field study, sul1 and intI1 exhibited constantly higher relative abundances. Their abundance was further positively correlated with increasing irrigation intensity. Controlled mesocosm experiments verified the observed field study results: the relative abundance of several genes, including sul1 and intI1, increased significantly when irrigating with TWW compared to freshwater irrigation. Overall, TWW irrigation promoted the spread of ARGs and intI1 in the subsoil pore-water, while the bacterial load was maintained. The combined results from the real-scale agricultural field and the controlled lab mesocosms indicate that the dissemination of ARGs in various subsurface environments needs to be taken into account during TWW irrigation scenarios.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/222497v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19b130corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ffb733org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1548ff0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b60361_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LITWW irrigation intensity and sul1 & intI1 abundance correlate in a real-scale field\nC_LIO_LIARGs & intI1 increase in subsoil pore-water during TWW irrigation in mesocosms\nC_LIO_LINo increase of ARGs & intI1 in freshwater irrigated mesocosms\nC_LIO_LITWW irrigation does not affect the bacterial load of subsoil pore-water\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Modulation of proteasome function by pharmacological interventions and molecular biology tools is an active area of research in cancer biology and neurodegenerative diseases. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a naturally occurring polyphenol that affects multiple signaling pathways and known to modulate PKC activities. The therapeutic significance of curcumin is often considered to reside in its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-angiogenic, or anti-apoptotic properties. However, recent research suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin may be due to its activity as a potent inhibitor of the proteasome. In this study, we show that both curcumin and its synthetic polyphenolic derivative (didemethylcurcumin), CUIII modulated proteasome activity in a biphasic manner. Curcumin and CUIII increased proteasome activity at nanomolar concentrations but inhibited proteasome activity at micromolar concentrations. Curcumin was more effective than CUIII in relative proteasome activity increase at nanomolar concentrations. Also, curcumin was more effective than CUIII in relative proteasome activity inhibition at micromolar concentration. The docking study was conducted on the 20S proteasome catalytic subunit. Estimated Kd values for curcumin and didemethylcurcumin are 0.0054M and 1.3167M, respectively. These values correlate well with the results of the effectiveness of modulation by curcumin compare to CUIII. The small size of CUIII makes its dock to the narrow cavity of the active site, but the binding interaction is not strong compare to curcumin. This study suggests that curcumin and its didemethyl derivative can be used to modulate proteasome activity. This communication implicates the reason why curcumin and its didemethyl derivative can be used to two different disease mechanisms, neurodegeneration, and cancer.",

Preclinical work using large-animal models (e.g., monkeys, dogs and sheep) has great utility for defining spinal drug distribution/pharmacokinetics and provide an important tool for defining safety. In this study, we investigated the impact of catheter implantation in the sub-dural space on CSF flow dynamics in Cynomolgus monkeys. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed before and after catheter implantation to quantify the differences based on catheter placement location in the cervical compared to the lumbar spine. Several geometric and hydrodynamic parameters were calculated based on the 3D segmentation and flow analysis. Hagen-Poiseuille equation was used to investigate the impact of catheter implantation on flow reduction and hydraulic resistance. A linear mixed-effects model was used in this study to investigate if there is a statistically significant difference between cervical and lumbar implantation, or between two MRI time points. Results showed that geometric parameters did not change statistically across MRI measurement time points and did not depend on catheter location. However, catheter insertion did have a significant impact on the hydrodynamic parameters and the effect was greater with the cervical implantation. CSF flow rate decreased up to 54.7% when the catheter located in the cervical region. The maximum flow rate reduction in the lumbar implantation group was 21%. Overall, lumbar catheter implantation disrupted CSF dynamics to a lesser degree than cervical catheter implantation and this effect remained up to two weeks post-catheter implantation",

    "abstract": "Although Candida spp. are frequently detected in fungal cultures of respiratory secretions, their presence is normally assumed to reflect benign colonization. However, there is growing evidence that Candida spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory diseases such as bronchiectasis and asthma. The aim of this study is to investigate the in vitro and in vivo effects of a novel antifungal triazole, PC945, optimised for topical delivery, against C. albicans. In temporarily neutropenic, immunocompromised mice, C. albicans (529L [ATCC(R)MYA4901] strain), inoculated intranasally, induced acute lung injury and death, associated with higher fungal burden and cytokine induction in the lung. PC945 saline suspension, dosed intranasally once daily, starting one day post candida inoculation, dose-dependently (0.56 ~ 14 g/mouse) improved survival rate and inhibited fungal load in the lung on Day 5 post inoculation. These effects by PC945 were 7 ~ 25-fold more potent than those of voriconazole, despite being of similar in vitro antifungal activity versus this strain. Furthermore, extended prophylaxis with low dose PC945 (0.56 g/mouse) was found to inhibit fungal load more potently than the shorter treatment regimens, suggesting antifungal effects of PC945 accumulated on repeat dosing. In addition, antifungal susceptibility testing on 88 candida isolates (C. albicans, C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis, C. lucitaniae, C. glabrata, C. guilliermondii) revealed that PC945 has potent effects on Candida species broadly. Thus, PC945 has the potential to be a novel topical therapy for the treatment of C. albicans pulmonary infection in humans.",

To overcome this limitation, we sought to develop a simplified method in the mouse that uses ultrasound-guided injection of potassium chloride directly into the heart.\n\nMethodsPotassium chloride was delivered directly into the left ventricular cavity under ultrasound guidance in intubated mice, resulting in immediate asystole. Mice were resuscitated with injection of epinephrine and manual chest compressions and evaluated for survival, body temperature, cardiac function, kidney damage, and diffuse tissue injury.\n\nResultsThe direct injection sudden cardiac arrest model causes rapid asystole with high surgical survival rates and low surgical duration. Sudden cardiac arrest mice with 8-min of asystole have significant cardiac dysfunction at 24 hours and high lethality within the first seven days, where after cardiac function begins to improve. Sudden cardiac arrest mice have secondary organ damage, including significant kidney injury, but no clear evidence of neurologic dysfunction.\n\nConclusionsUltrasound-guided direct injection of potassium chloride allows for rapid and reliable cardiac arrest in the mouse that mirrors human pathology. This technique lowers the barriers to entry for adoption of the mouse model of sudden cardiac arrest, which will improve investigators ability to study the mechanisms underlying post-arrest changes.",

    "abstract": "The recent global pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents an urgent need for new therapeutic candidates. While the importance of traditional in silico approaches such as QSAR in such efforts in unquestionable, these models fundamentally rely on structural similarity to infer biological activity and are thus prone to becoming trapped in the very nearby chemical spaces of already known ligands. For novel and unprecedented threats such as COVID-19 much faster and efficient paradigms must be devised to accelerate the identification of new chemical classes for rapid drug development. Here we report the development of a new biological activity-based modeling (BABM) approach that builds on the hypothesis that compounds with similar activity patterns tend to share similar targets or mechanisms of action. In BABM, compound activity profiles established on massive scale across multiple assays are used as signatures to predict compound activity in a new assay or against a new target. We first trained and validated this approach by identifying new antiviral lead candidates for Zika and Ebola based on data from ~0.5 million compounds screened against ~2,000 assays. BABM models were then applied to predict ~300 compounds not previously reported to have activity for SARS-CoV-2, which were then tested in a live virus assay with high (>30%) hit rates. The most potent compounds showed antiviral activities in the nanomolar range. These potent confirmed compounds have the potential to be further developed in novel chemical space into new anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies. These results demonstrate unprecedented ability using BABM to predict novel structures as chemical leads significantly beyond traditional methods, and its application in rapid drug discovery response in a global public health crisis.",

The current standard protocols in practice test single variants or single regions (that contain multiple local variants) sequentially along the genome, followed by functional annotations that involve various aspects including interactions. The testing of genetic interactions upfront is rare in practice due to the burden of testing a huge number of combinations, which lead to the multiple-test problem and the risk of overfitting. In this work, we developed interaction-integrated linear mixed model (ILMM), a novel model that integrates a priori knowledge into linear mixed models. ILMM enables statistical integration of genetic interactions upfront and overcomes the problems associated with combination searching.\n\nThree dimensional (3D) genomic interactions assessed by Hi-C experiments have led to unprecedented biological discoveries. However, the contribution of 3D genomic interactions to the genetic basis of complex diseases has yet to be quantified. Using 3D interacting regions as a priori information, we conducted both simulations and real data analysis to test ILMM. By applying ILMM to whole genome sequencing data for Autism Spectrum Disorders, or ASD (MSSNG) and transcriptome sequencing data (GTEx), we revealed the 3D-genetic basis of ASD and 3D-eQTLs for a substantial proportion of gene expression in brain tissues. Moreover, we have revealed a potential mechanism involving distal regulation between FOXP2 and DNMT3A conferring the risk of ASD.\n\nSoftware is freely available in our GitHub: https://github.com/theLongLab/Jawamix5",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVariations in the human genome have been studied extensively. However, little is known about the role of micro-inversions (MIs), generally defined as small (<100 bp) inversions, in human evolution, diversity, and health. Depicting the pattern of MIs among diverse populations is critical for interpreting human evolutionary history and obtaining insight into genetic diseases.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we explored the distribution of MIs in genomes from 26 human populations and 7 nonhuman primate genomes and analyzed the phylogenetic structure of the 26 human populations based on the MIs. We further investigated the functions of the MIs located within genes associated with human health. With hg19 as the reference genome, we detected 6,968 MIs among the 1,937 human samples and 24,476 MIs among the 7 nonhuman primate genomes. The analyses of MIs in human genomes showed that the MIs were rarely located in exonic regions. Nonhuman primates and human populations shared only 82 inverted alleles, and Africans had the most inverted alleles in common with nonhuman primates, which was consistent with the \"Out of Africa\" hypothesis. The clustering of MIs among the human populations also coincided with human migration history and ancestral lineages.\n\nConclusionsWe propose that MIs are potential evolutionary markers for investigating population dynamics. Our results revealed the diversity of MIs in human populations and showed that they are essential to constructing human population relationships and have a potential effect on human health.",

    "abstract": "Alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) have been shown to play an important role in dynamic neural processes underlying learning and memory. The goal of this study was to scrutinize the role of  oscillations in communication within a network implicated in motor sequence learning. To this end, we conducted two experiments using the serial reaction time task. In the first experiment, we explored changes in  power and cross-channel  coherence. We found a gradual decrease in learning-related  power over left premotor cortex (PMC), somatosensory cortex (S1) and tempo-parietal junction (TPJ). Alpha coherence between left PMC/S1 and right cerebellar crus I was reduced for sequence learning, possibly reflecting a functional decoupling in a motor-cerebellar loop during the motor learning process. In the second experiment in a different cohort, we applied 10Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), a method shown to entrain local oscillatory activity, to left M1 (lM1) and right cerebellum (rCB) during sequence learning. We observed learning deficits during rCB tACS compared to sham, but not during lM1 tACS. In addition, learning-related  power following rCB tACS was increased in left PMC, possibly reflecting a decrease in neural activity. Importantly, learning-specific coherence between left PMC and right cerebellar lobule VIIb was enhanced following rCB tACS. These findings suggest that interactions within a premotor-cerebellar loop, which are underlying motor sequence learning, are mediated by  oscillations. We show that they can be modulated through external entrainment of cerebellar oscillations, which then modulates motor cortical  and interferes with sequence learning.",

    "abstract": "The precise role played by the hippocampus in supporting cognitive functions such as episodic memory and future thinking is debated, but there is general agreement that it involves constructing representations comprised of numerous elements. Visual scenes have been deployed extensively in cognitive neuroscience because they are paradigmatic multi-element stimuli. However, questions remain about the specificity and nature of the hippocampal response to scenes. Here, we devised a paradigm in which we had participants search pairs of images for either colour or layout differences, thought to be associated with perceptual or spatial constructive processes respectively. Importantly, images depicted either naturalistic scenes or phase-scrambled versions of the same scenes, and were either simple or complex. Using this paradigm during functional MRI scanning, we addressed three questions: 1. Is the hippocampus recruited specifically during scene processing? 2. If the hippocampus is more active in response to scenes, does searching for colour or layout differences influence its activation? 3. Does the complexity of the scenes affect its response? We found that, compared to phase-scrambled versions of the scenes, the hippocampus was more responsive to scene stimuli. Moreover, a clear anatomical distinction was evident, with colour detection in scenes engaging the posterior hippocampus whereas layout detection in scenes recruited the anterior hippocampus. The complexity of the scenes did not influence hippocampal activity. These findings seem to align with perspectives that propose the hippocampus is especially attuned to scenes, and its involvement occurs irrespective of the cognitive process or the complexity of the scenes.",

    "abstract": "UK Biobank is a major prospective epidemiological study that is carrying out detailed multimodal brain imaging on 100,000 participants, and includes genetics and ongoing health outcomes. As a step forwards in understanding genetic influence on brain structure and function, in 2018 we published genome-wide associations of 3,144 brain imaging-derived phenotypes, with a discovery sample of 8,428 UKB subjects. Here we present a new open resource of GWAS summary statistics, resulting from a greatly expanded set of genetic associations with brain phenotypes, using the 2020 UKB imaging data release of approximately 40,000 subjects. The discovery sample has now almost tripled (22,138), the number of phenotypes increased to 3,935 and the number of genetic variants with MAF[&ge;]1% increased to 10 million. For the first time, we include associations on the X chromosome, and several new classes of image derived phenotypes (primarily, more fine-grained subcortical volumes, and cortical grey-white intensity contrast). Previously we had found 148 replicated clusters of associations between genetic variants and imaging phenotypes; here we find 692 replicating clusters of associations, including 12 on the X chromosome. We describe some of the newly found associations, focussing particularly on the X chromosome and autosomal associations involving the new classes of image derived phenotypes. Our novel associations implicate pathways involved in the rare X-linked syndrome STAR (syndactyly, telecanthus and anogenital and renal malformations), Alzheimers disease and mitochondrial disorders.

    "abstract": "The study of naturalistic social behavior requires quantification of animals interactions. This is generally done through manual annotation--a highly time consuming and tedious process. Recent advances in computer vision enable tracking the pose (posture) of freely-behaving animals. However, automatically and accurately classifying complex social behaviors remains technically challenging. We introduce the Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS), an automated pipeline for pose estimation and behavior quantification in pairs of freely interacting mice. We compare MARSs annotations to human annotations and find that MARSs pose estimation and behavior classification achieve human-level performance. We also release the pose and annotation datasets used to train MARS, to serve as community benchmarks and resources. Finally, we introduce the Behavior Ensemble and Neural Trajectory Observatory (BENTO), a graphical user interface for analysis of multimodal neuroscience datasets. Together, MARS and BENTO provide an end-to-end pipeline for behavior data extraction and analysis, in a package that is user-friendly and easily modifiable.",

    "abstract": "How neural networks evolved to generate the diversity of species-specific communication signals is unknown. For receivers of the signals one hypothesis is that novel recognition phenotypes arise from parameter variation in computationally flexible feature detection networks. We test this hypothesis in crickets, where males generate and females recognize the mating songs with a species-specific pulse pattern, by investigating whether the song recognition network in the cricket brain has the computational flexibility to recognize different temporal features. Using electrophysiological recordings from the network that recognizes crucial properties of the pulse pattern on the short timescale in the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus, we built a computational model that reproduces the neuronal and behavioral tuning of that species. An analysis of the models parameter space reveals that the network can provide all recognition phenotypes for pulse duration and pause known in crickets and even other insects. Phenotypic diversity in the model is consistent with known preference types in crickets and other insects, and arise from computations that likely evolved to increase energy efficiency and robustness of pattern recognition. The models parameter to phenotype mapping is degenerate--different network parameters can create similar changes in the phenotype--which likely supports evolutionary plasticity. Our study suggests that computationally flexible networks underlie the diverse pattern recognition phenotypes and we reveal network properties that constrain and support behavioral diversity.",

    "abstract": "Many small parasitoid wasps have a black-orange-black (BOB) color pattern, which is usually present in both sexes. A likely function of this widespread pattern is aposematic (warning) coloration, but this has never been investigated. To test this hypothesis, we presented spider predators (Lyssomanes jemineus), both field-captured and lab-reared individuals, to a species with the BOB pattern and a congeneric all-black species in each of four scelionid genera (Baryconus, Chromoteleia, Macroteleia and Scelio). Each spider/wasp trial was filmed for 40 minutes under controlled conditions and three behavioral responses (detect, attack, avoid) were recorded in each of 136 trials, never using the same predator and prey more than once. In order to better understand the results obtained, two additional studies were performed. First, the reflection spectrum of the cuticle of the wasp and a theoretical visual sensibility model of the spider were used to calculate a parameter we called \"absorption contrast\" that allowed us to compare the perception contrast between black and orange in each wasp genus as viewed by the spider. Second, acute toxicity trials with the water flea, Daphnia magna, were performed to determine toxicity differences between BOB and non-BOB wasps. By combining the results from the three types of experiments, together with a statistical analysis, we confirmed that BOB color pattern plays an aposematic role.",

    "abstract": "Two drought-tolerant wheat cultivars,  TAM 111 and  TAM 112, have been widely grown in the Southern Great Plains of the U.S. and used as parents in many wheat breeding programs worldwide. This study aimed to reveal genetic control of yield and yield components in the two cultivars under both dryland and irrigated conditions. A mapping population containing 124 F5:7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from the cross of TAM 112/TAM 111. A set of 5,948 SNPs from the wheat 90K iSelect array and double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing was used to construct high-density genetic maps. Data for yield and yield components were obtained from 11 environments. QTL analyses were performed based on 11 individual environments, across all environments, within and across mega-environments. Thirty-six unique consistent QTL regions were distributed on 13 chromosomes including 1A, 1B, 1D, 2A, 2D, 3D, 4B, 4D, 6A, 6B, 6D, 7B, and 7D. Ten unique QTL with pleiotropic effects were identified on four chromosomes and eight were in common with the consistent QTL. These QTL increased dry biomass grain yield by 16.3 g m-2, plot yield by 28.1 g m-2, kernels spike-1 by 0.7, spikes m-2 by 14.8, thousand kernel weight by 0.9 g with favorable alleles from either parent. TAM 112 alleles mainly increased spikes m-2 and thousand kernel weight while TMA 111 alleles increased kernels spike-1, harvest index and grain yield. The saturated genetic map and markers linked to significant QTL from this study will be very useful in developing high throughput genotyping markers for tracking the desirable haplotypes of these important yield-related traits in popular parental cultivars.",

One of the current challenges in this area is to determine the proper information and develop the technologies required for using macaw palm, allowing it to contribute to the sustainable production of feedstock for biodiesel industry. The principle of mechanical vibration can be employed for the detachment of fruits from a tree bunch, and it is therefore necessary to study the dynamic behavior of the macaw palm fruit-rachilla system during the vibration. Hence, the modal properties of the system were determined. A study on the dynamic behaviors was carried out using a deterministic finite element model, and the natural frequencies were obtained through a frequency-scanning test to evaluate the model. The mean relative error (MRE) between the measured and simulated natural frequencies was also used to evaluate the model. The natural frequencies, determined experimentally, varied between 26.21 and 33.45 Hz on average, whereas the simulated frequencies varied from 24.81 to 39.27 Hz. The overall MRE was 9.08%. Once the model was validated, a sensibility test showed that the density of fruit and the elasticity modulus are the parameters that most influence the natural frequencies of the fruit-rachilla system.",
