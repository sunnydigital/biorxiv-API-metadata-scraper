    "abstract": "A significant, positive association between selenium status and prognosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection has been identified among COVID-19 patients in China. Moreover, a German study revealed a pronounced deficit of serum selenium and SELENOP concentrations in COVID-19 patients, and selenium deficiency was associated with mortality risk from COVID-19. The present study investigated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 on gene expression of host selenoproteins which mediate many beneficial actions of selenium. We found that SARS-CoV-2 suppressed mRNA expression of selenoproteins associated with ferroptosis (GPX4), endoplasmic reticulum stress (SELENOF, SELENOK, SELENOM and SELENOS) and DNA synthesis (TXNRD3), while SARS-CoV-2 increased gene expression of IL-6 (an inflammatory cytokine positively correlated with severity of COVID-19), in Vero cells. These results provide a deeper insight into the connection between selenium and SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Humans and non-human animals show great flexibility in spatial navigation, including the ability to return to specific locations based on as few as one single experience. To study spatial navigation in the laboratory, watermaze tasks, in which rats have to find a hidden platform in a pool of cloudy water surrounded by spatial cues, have long been used. Analogous tasks have been developed for human participants using virtual environments. Spatial learning in the watermaze is facilitated by the hippocampus. In particular, rapid, one-trial, allocentric place learning, as measured in the Delayed-Matching-to-Place (DMP) variant of the watermaze task, which requires rodents to learn repeatedly new locations in a familiar environment, is hippocampal dependent. In this article, we review some computational principles, embedded within a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, that utilise hippocampal spatial representations for navigation in watermaze tasks. We consider which key elements underlie their efficacy, and discuss their limitations in accounting for hippocampus-dependent navigation, both in terms of behavioural performance (i.e., how well do they reproduce behavioural measures of rapid place learning) and neurobiological realism (i.e., how well do they map to neurobiological substrates involved in rapid place learning). We discuss how an actor-critic architecture, enabling simultaneous assessment of the value of the current location and of the optimal direction to follow, can reproduce one-trial place learning performance as shown on watermaze and virtual DMP tasks by rats and humans, respectively, if complemented with map-like place representations. The contribution of actor-critic mechanisms to DMP performance is consistent with neurobiological findings implicating the striatum and hippocampo-striatal interaction in DMP performance, given that the striatum has been associated with actor-critic mechanisms. Moreover, we illustrate that hierarchical computations embedded within an actor-critic architecture may help to account for aspects of flexible spatial navigation. The hierarchical RL approach separates trajectory control via a temporal-difference error from goal selection via a goal prediction error and may account for flexible, trial-specific, navigation to familiar goal locations, as required in some arm-maze place memory tasks, although it does not capture one-trial learning of new goal locations, as observed in open field, including watermaze and virtual, DMP tasks. Future models of one-shot learning of new goal locations, as observed on DMP tasks, should incorporate hippocampal plasticity mechanisms that integrate new goal information with allocentric place representation, as such mechanisms are supported by substantial empirical evidence.",

    "abstract": "The brain exhibits a complex temporal structure which translates into a hierarchy of distinct neural timescales. An open question is how these intrinsic timescales are related to sensory or motor information processing and whether these dynamics have common patterns in different behavioural states. We address these questions by investigating the brains intrinsic timescales in healthy controls, motor (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, locked-in syndrome), sensory (anaesthesia, unresponsive wakefulness syndrome), and progressive reduction of sensory processing (from awake states over N1, N2, N3). We employed a combination of measures from EEG resting-state data: auto-correlation window (ACW), power spectral density (PSD), and power-law exponent (PLE). Prolonged neural timescales accompanied by a shift towards slower frequencies were observed in the conditions with sensory deficits, but not in conditions with motor deficits. Our results establish that the spontaneous activitys intrinsic neural timescale is related to specifically sensory rather than motor information processing in the healthy brain.\n\nHighlightsO_LIEEG resting-state shows a hierarchy of intrinsic neural timescales.\nC_LIO_LISensory deficits as in disorders of consciousness lead to prolonged intrinsic neuraltimescales.\nC_LIO_LIClinical conditions with motor deficits do not show changes in intrinsic neural timescales.20\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=156 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/229161v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1893c45org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d4176dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4dfaa8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@183621e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Ghrelin is a gastric-derived peptide hormone with demonstrated impact on alcohol intake and craving, but the reverse side of this bidirectional link, i.e., the effects of alcohol on the ghrelin system, remains to be fully established. To characterize the downstream effects of alcohol on the ghrelin system, we examined the following: (1) plasma ghrelin levels across four human laboratory alcohol administration experiments with non-treatment seeking, heavy-drinking participants, (2) expression of ghrelin, ghrelin receptor, and ghrelin-O-acyltransferase (GOAT) genes (GHRL, GHSR, and MBOAT4, respectively) in human post-mortem brain tissue from individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) vs. controls, (3) plasma ghrelin levels in Ghsr knockout and wild-type rats following intraperitoneal (i.p.) ethanol administration, (4) effect of ethanol on ghrelin secretion from gastric mucosa cells ex vivo and GOAT enzymatic activity in vitro, and (5) plasma ghrelin levels in rats following i.p. ethanol administration vs. an iso-caloric sucrose solution. Peripheral acyl- and total ghrelin levels significantly decreased following acute ethanol administration in humans. No difference in GHRL, GHSR, and MBOAT4 mRNA expression in the brain was observed between AUD vs. control post-mortem samples. In rats, acyl-ghrelin levels significantly decreased following i.p. ethanol administration in both genotype groups (Ghsr knockout and wild-type), while des-acyl-ghrelin was not affected by ethanol. No effect of ethanol was observed ex vivo on ghrelin secretion from gastric mucosa cells or in vitro on GOAT acylation activity. Lastly, we observed different effects of i.p. ethanol and sucrose solution on acyl- and des-acyl-ghrelin in rats despite administering amounts with equivalent caloric value. Ethanol acutely decreases peripheral ghrelin concentrations in humans and rats, and our findings suggest that this effect does not occur through interaction with ghrelin-secreting gastric mucosal cells, the ghrelin receptor, or the GOAT enzyme. Moreover, this effect does not appear to be proportional to caloric load. Our findings, therefore, suggest that ethanol does not suppress circulating ghrelin through direct interaction with the ghrelin system, or in proportion to the caloric value of alcohol, and may differentially affect ghrelin acylation and ghrelin peptide secretion.",

    "abstract": "Membrane curvature has emerged as an intriguing physical organization principle underlying biological signaling and membrane trafficking. FBP17 of the CIP4/FBP17/Toca-1 F-BAR family is unique in the BAR family because its structurally folded F-BAR domain does not contain any hydrophobic motifs that insert into lipid bilayer. While it has been widely assumed so, whether the banana-shaped F-BAR domain alone can sense curvature has never been experimentally demonstrated. Using a nanopillar-supported lipid bilayer system, we found that the F-BAR domain of FBP17 displayed minimal curvature sensing in vitro. We further identified an alternatively spliced intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of FBP17 next to its F-BAR domain that is conserved in sequence across species. The IDR senses membrane curvature and its sensing ability greatly exceeds that of F-BAR domain alone. In living cells, presence of the IDR domain changed the dynamics of FBP17 recruitment in a curvature-coupled cortical wave system. Collectively, we propose that FBP17 does sense curvature but contrary to the common belief, its curvature sensing capability largely originates from its disordered region, not F-BAR domain itself.",

    "abstract": "The superfamily-1 helicase non-structural protein 13 (nsp13) is required for SARS-CoV-2 replication, making it an important antiviral therapeutic target. The mechanism and regulation of nsp13 has not been explored at the single-molecule level. Specifically, force-dependent unwinding experiments have yet to be performed for any coronavirus helicase. Here, using optical tweezers, we find that nsp13 unwinding frequency, processivity, and velocity increase substantially when a destabilizing force is applied to the dsRNA, suggesting a passive unwinding mechanism. These results, along with bulk assays, depict nsp13 as an intrinsically weak helicase that can be potently activated by picoNewton forces. Such force-dependent behavior contrasts the known behavior of other viral monomeric helicases, drawing stronger parallels to ring-shaped helicases. Our findings suggest that mechanoregulation, which may be provided by a directly bound RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, enables on-demand helicase activity on the relevant polynucleotide substrate during viral replication.",

    "abstract": "In plants, large numbers of R genes, which segregate as loci with alternative alleles conferring different resistance to pathogens, have been maintained over a long evolutionary time. In theory, there seem to be no reason for hosts to harbor these susceptible alleles in view of their null contribution to resistance. As such, why should populations support disease-susceptible individuals along with disease-resistant individuals? In rice, a single copy R gene Pi-ta segregates for two expressed clades of alleles, one resistant and the other susceptible. We discovered that knockout of the Pi-ta susceptible alleles induced drastic fitness decline in the absence of pathogens. Gene expression profiling and endogenous hormones quantification showed that the susceptible alleles might serve as an off-switch to the downstream immune signaling, thus contributing to fine-tuning of plant defense response. The fitness benefit of carrying a susceptible Pi-ta allele provides a plausible explanation for their retention in the genome.",

This speed increase enables the analysis of more complex models, which motivated the extension of dadi to four- and five-population models. Remarkably, dadi performs almost as well on inexpensive consumer-grade GPUs as on expensive server-grade GPUs. GPU computing thus offers large and accessible benefits to the community of dadi users.

We provide a new method for computing genetic similarities among individuals using phylogenetic trees. Our method can supplement (or stand in for) computations based on genotypes. We provide simulations suggesting that the genetic similarity matrices computed from trees are consistent with those computed from genotypes. With our methods, quantitative analysis on genetic traits and analysis of heritability and co-heritability can be conducted directly using genetic similarity matrices and so in the absence of genotype data, or under uncertainty in the phylogenetic tree.

Neutralizing antibody responses were observed after a single dose, with exceptionally high titers achieved after boosting. Furthermore, neutralizing antibody titers elicited by a dose-sparing regimen in mice were similar to those obtained from a high dose regimen.

    "abstract": "Variation in ploidy occurs naturally in select plant and animal species. Ploidy variation can also occur spontaneously or be induced during artificial propagation of fish and shellfish. Studying species and systems that have variable ploidy requires techniques to infer ploidy of individuals. Massively parallel sequencing of biallelic SNPs has been used to infer ploidy, but existing techniques have several drawbacks. These include being limited to only comparing a fixed number of ploidies (diploidy, triploidy, and tetraploidy) and requiring that heterozygous genotypes in an individual be identified prior to ploidy inference. We describe a method of inferring ploidy from sequencing of biallelic SNPs based on beta-binomial mixture models. This method is generalized to apply to any ploidy and does not require prior identification of heterozygous genotypes. We demonstrate efficacy of this method for comparing ancestral octoploidy, decaploidy, and dodecaploidy (tetraploidy, pentaploidy, and hexaploidy for the sequenced SNPs) in white sturgeon and diploidy and triploidy in Chinook salmon with amplicon sequencing (GT-seq) data. Results indicated that ploidy could be reliably estimated for individuals based on distinct distribution of log-likelihood ratios (LLR) for known ploidy samples of both species that were tested. Confidence in ploidy estimates increased with sequencing depth. We encourage users to explore the sequencing depths and LLR critical values that provide reliable estimates of ploidy for a given organism and set of SNPs. We expect that the R package provided will empower studies of genetic variation and inheritance in organisms that vary in ploidy naturally or as a result of artificial propagation practices.",

    "abstract": "The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a devastating impact across the world. SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19) is known to use receptor-binding domain (RBD) at viral surface spike (S) protein to interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor expressed on many human cell types. The RBD-ACE2 interaction is a crucial step to mediate the host cell entry of SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies indicate that the ACE2 interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has higher affinity than its binding with the structurally identical S protein of SARS-CoV-1, the virus causing the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak. However, the biophysical mechanism behind such binding affinity difference is unclear. This study utilizes a combined single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulation approach to quantify the specific interactions between CoV-2 or CoV-1 RBD and ACE2. Depending on the loading rates, the unbinding forces between CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 range from 70 to 110 pN, and are 30-50% higher than those of CoV-1 RBD and ACE2 under similar loading rates. SMD results indicate that CoV-2 RBD interacts with the N-linked glycan on Asn90 of ACE2. This interaction is mostly absent in the CoV-1 RBD-ACE2 complex. During the SMD simulations, the extra RBD-N-glycan interaction contributes to a greater force and prolonged interaction lifetime. The observation is confirmed by our experimental force spectroscopy study. After the removal of N-linked glycans on ACE2, its mechanical binding strength with CoV-2 RBD decreases to a similar level of the CoV-1 RBD-ACE2 interaction. Together, the study uncovers the mechanism behind the difference in ACE2 binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, and could aid in the development of new strategies to block SARS-CoV-2 entry.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThis study utilizes a combined single-molecule force spectroscopy and steered molecular dynamics simulation approach to quantify the specific interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-1 receptor-binding domain and human ACE2. The study reveals the mechanism behind the difference in ACE2 binding between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1, and could aid in the development of new strategies to block SARS-CoV-2 entry.",

    "abstract": "The massive worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is fueling the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the first whole-genome sequence was published in January 2020, a growing database of tens of thousands of viral genomes has been constructed. This offers opportunities to study pathways of molecular change in the expanding viral population that can help identify molecular culprits of virulence and virus spread. Here we investigate the genomic accumulation of mutations at various time points of the early pandemic to identify changes in mutationally highly active genomic regions that are occurring worldwide. We used the Wuhan NC_045512.2 sequence as a reference and sampled 15,342 indexed sequences from GISAID, translating them into proteins and grouping them by month of deposition. The per-position amino acid frequencies and Shannon entropies of the coding sequences were calculated for each month, and a map of intrinsic disorder regions and binding sites was generated. The analysis revealed dominant variants, most of which were located in loop regions and on the surface of the proteins. Mutation entropy decreased between March and April of 2020 after steady increases at several sites, including the D614G mutation site of the spike (S) protein that was previously found associated with higher case fatality rates and at sites of the NSP 12 polymerase and the NSP13 helicase proteins. Notable expanding mutations include R203K and G204R of the nucleocapsid (N) protein inter-domain linker region and G251V of the viroporin encoded by ORF3a between March and April. The regions spanning these mutations exhibited significant intrinsic disorder, which was enhanced and decreased by the N-protein and viroporin 3a protein mutations, respectively. These results predict an ongoing mutational shift from the spike and replication complex to other regions, especially to encoded molecules known to represent major {beta}-interferon antagonists. The study provides valuable information for therapeutics and vaccine design, as well as insight into mutation tendencies that could facilitate preventive control.",

    "abstract": "Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have the potential to increase crop yields and all globally important crops form the mycorrhizal symbiosis. Only a few studies have investigated the impact of introduced AMF on local AMF communities and most studies have only investigated effects of one isolate. We studied the impact on AMF community structure of inoculating roots of the globally important crop cassava with highly genetically-related clonal siblings of two genetically different Rhizophagus irregularis isolates. We hypothesized that inoculation with R. irregularis siblings differentially influences the structure and the diversity of the pre-existing AMF community colonizing cassava. Alpha and beta taxonomic and phylogenetic AMF diversity were strongly and significantly altered differentially following inoculation with sibling AMF progeny. In most cases, the effects were also cassava-genotype specific. Although biomass production and AMF colonization were also both differentially affected by inoculation with sibling R. irregularis progeny these variables were not correlated with changes in the AMF community structure. The results highlight that investigations on the impact of an introduced AMF species, that use only one isolate, are unlikely to be representative of the overall effects of that AMF species and that the genetic identity of the host must be considered. The amount of inoculum added was very small and effects were observed 12 months following inoculation. That such a small amount of almost genetically identical fungal inoculum can strongly differentially influence AMF community structure 12 months following inoculation, indicates that AMF communities in tropical soils are not very resistant to perturbation.",

Here, we use a mechanistic movement model to quantify the role of memory in the movements of a large mammal reintroduced into a novel environment, and to predict observed patterns of home range emergence. We show that an interplay between memory and resource preferences is the primary process influencing the movements of reintroduced roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Our memory-based model fitted with empirical data successfully predicts the formation of home ranges, as well as emerging properties of movement and revisits observed in the reintroduced animals. These results provide a quantitative framework for combining memory-based movements, resource preference and the emergence of home ranges in nature.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWConspecific insect herbivores co-occurring on the same host plant interact both directly through interference competition and indirectly through exploitative competition, plant-mediated interactions and enemy-mediated interactions. However, the situation is less clear when the interactions between conspecific insect herbivores are separated in time within the same growing season, as it is the case for multivoltine species. We hypothesized that early season herbivory would result in reduced egg laying and reduced performance of the next generation of herbivores on previously attacked plants. We tested this hypothesis in a choice experiment with box tree moth females (Cydalima perspectalis Walker, Lepidoptera: Crambidae). These females were exposed to box trees (Buxus sempervirens L., Buxaceae) that were either undamaged or attacked by conspecific larvae earlier in the season. We then compared the performance of the next generation larvae on previously damaged vs undamaged plants. Previous herbivory had no effect on oviposition behaviour, but the weight of next generation larvae was significantly lower in previously damaged plants. There was a negative correlation between the number of egg clutches laid on plants by the first generation and the performance of the next generation larvae. Overall, our findings reveal that early season herbivory reduces the performance of conspecific individuals on the same host plant later in the growing season, and that this time-lagged intraspecific competition results from a mismatch between the oviposition preference of females and the performance of its offspring.",

    "abstract": "Access to reproduction is determined by an individual dominances rank in many species and is achieved through aggression and/or dominance signalling. In eusocial insects one or several dominant females (queens) monopolize reproduction but to what extent queens rely on aggression and signalling remains obscure. Aggression is costly and its efficiency depends on the group size, whereas signalling may reduce the risks and costs of aggression. Both strategies are used to regulate reproduction in social taxa, with aggression being more common in small social groups, compared to signalling in larger societies.\n\nHere, we examine the use of aggression and chemical signalling in a social species (Bombus impatiens) where the dominant queen interacts with increasing numbers of workers as she ages.\n\nWe found that the queens strategy to monopolize reproduction changes with life stage, shifting from overt aggression to chemical signalling as the queen gets older. Particularly, old queens exhibited a higher ratio of short to long cuticular hydrocarbons compared to young queens, an endogenous shift that was attributed to age, as all egg-laying queens were fecund and kept with the same number of workers. Our findings contribute to the understanding of reproductive dominance in the context of an individuals life history.",

    "abstract": "While facultative sex is common in sexually reproducing species, for reasons of tractability most mathematical models assume that such sex is asynchronous in the population. In this paper, we develop a model of switching environments to instead capture the effect of an entire population transitioning synchronously between sexual and asexual modes of reproduction. We use this model to investigate the evolution of the number of self-incompatible mating types in finite populations, which empirically can range from two to thousands. When environmental switching is fast, we recover the results of earlier studies that implicitly assumed populations were engaged in asynchronous sexual reproduction. However when the environment switches slowly, we see deviations from previous asynchronous theory, including a lower number of mating types at equilibrium and bimodality in the stationary distribution of mating types. We provide analytic approximations for both the fast and slow switching regimes, as well as a numerical scheme based on the Kolmogorov equations for the system to quickly evaluate the model dynamics at intermediate parameters. Our approach exploits properties of integer partitions in number theory. We also demonstrate how additional biological processes such as selective sweeps can be accounted for in this switching environment framework, showing that beneficial mutations can further erode mating type diversity in synchronous facultatively sexual populations.",

    "abstract": "Cullin-RING Ligases (CRLs) are a family of multi-unit E3 ubiquitin ligases with two members of RING family proteins, acting as the catalytic subunit: RING-box 1 (Rbx1) couples with CRLs1-4, whereas RING-box 2 (Rbx2/Sag) couples mainly with CRL5.1-4 Activity of CRLs requires neddylation on their Cullin subunit, catalyzed by neddylation enzyme cascades E1, E2 and E3. Ube2m and Ube2f are two neddylation E2s responsible for neddylation of Cullins in CRLs1-4 or CRL5, respectively.5-6 Regulatory T cells (Treg cells) are specialized immunosuppressive CD4+ T lymphocytes, that play pivotal roles in maintaining immune homeostasis in vivo.7-10 Whether and how Rbx1-Rbx2/CRLs and Ube2m-Ube2f/neddylation regulate Treg cell homeostasis and function are currently unknown. Here we show that while mice with a Treg-specific deletion of Rbx2/Sag showed no obvious phenotype, mice with Rbx1 deletion in Treg cells developed an early-onset fetal inflammatory disorders and death at day ~25 after birth (~p25), with disrupted homeostasis and functions of Treg cells, indicating Rbx1 as a prominent regulator of Treg cells. Single cell transcriptome assay showed that Rbx1 is essential for the maintenance of the effector subpopulations in Treg cells. The whole genome transcriptome and proteomics analysis revealed that Rbx1 regulates several inflammatory pathways, such as T-cell receptor, IL-17, TNF, NF{kappa}B, chemokine, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, as well as energy and purine metabolisms. Accumulation of Acly, Fto and Nfkbib proteins, upon Rbx1 depletion suggests that these are likely the novel substrates of CRLs1-4 in Treg cells. Consistently, while Ube2f deletion showed no obvious phenotype, mice with Ube2m deletion in Treg cells also suffers from inflammatory disorders, but to a much lesser severity with a 50% of death rate at ~150 days of age. Since Rbx1 is a dual E3 as a component of CRLs1-4 ligase and as a neddylation co-E3, downstream of Ube2m E2 for neddylation activation of CRLs1-45, much severe phenotypes in Foxp3cre;Rbx1fl/fl mice suggests Rbx1 may have additional function independent of neddylation activation in Treg cells. Indeed, unbiased transcriptome comparison between Rbx1-deficient and Ube2m-deficient Treg cells, revealed that the former had greater as well as unique alteration in the signaling pathways controlling the inflammatory responses. Collectively, our study shows that the Ube2m-Rbx1 axis of the neddylation-CRL is required for the maintenance of homeostasis and functional fitness of Treg cells in the fine control of immune tolerance; with implication that targeting the neddylation/CRLs, such as a small molecule inhibitor pevonedistat11, currently in the Phase II clinic trial for anticancer therapy, may have novel application in the treatment of human diseases associated with overactivated Treg cells.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile has emerged as a noteworthy pathogen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Concurrent IBD and CDI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality compared to CDI alone. IBD is associated with alterations of the gut microbiota, an important mediator of colonization resistance to C. difficile. Here, we describe and utilize a mouse model to explore the role of intestinal inflammation in susceptibility to C. difficile colonization and subsequent disease severity in animals with underlying IBD. Helicobacter hepaticus, a normal member of the mouse gut microbiota, was used to trigger inflammation in the distal intestine akin to human IBD in mice that lack intact IL-10 signaling. Development of IBD resulted in a distinct intestinal microbiota community compared to non-IBD controls. We demonstrate that in this murine model, IBD was sufficient to render mice susceptible to C. difficile colonization. Mice with IBD were persistently colonized by C. difficile, while genetically identical non-IBD controls were resistant to C. difficile colonization. Concomitant IBD and CDI was associated with significantly worse disease than unaccompanied IBD. IL-10-deficient mice maintained gut microbial diversity and colonization resistance to C. difficile in experiments utilizing an isogenic mutant of H. hepaticus that does not trigger intestinal inflammation. These studies in mice demonstrate that the IBD-induced microbiota is sufficient for C. difficile colonization and that this mouse model requires intestinal inflammation for inducing susceptibility to CDI in the absence of other perturbations, such as antibiotic treatment.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe incidence of CDI continues to increase significantly among patients with IBD, independent of antibiotic use, yet the relationship between IBD and increased risk for CDI remains to be understood. However, antibiotic-induced perturbations of the gut microbiota may mask mechanisms specific to IBD-induced C. difficile susceptibility and infection. Our study sought to describe and utilize a mouse model to specifically explore the relationship between the IBD-induced gut microbial community and susceptibility to C. difficile colonization and CDI development. We demonstrate that IBD is sufficient for C. difficile colonization and infection in mice and results in significantly worse disease than IBD alone, representing a murine model that recapitulates human IBD and CDI comorbidity. Furthermore, this model requires IBD-induced inflammation to sculpt a microbiota permissible to C. difficile colonization. Use of this model will aid in developing new clinical approaches to predict, diagnose, and treat C. difficile infection in the IBD population.",

We consider simple non-monotonic, distance-dependent connectivity schemes in weakly coupled 1-D networks where cells make strong connections with their kth nearest neighbors on each side. Using the phase model reduction of the network system, we prove the existence of cluster solutions where neurons that are spatially close together are also synchronized in the same cluster, and find stability conditions for these solutions. Our analysis predicts the long-term behavior for networks of neurons, and we confirm our results by numerical simulations of biophysical neuron network models. Additionally, we add weaker coupling between closer neighbors as a perturbation to our network connectivity. We analyze the existence and stability of cluster solutions of the perturbed network and validate our results with numerical simulations.

    "abstract": "Research on attentional control has largely focused on single senses and the importance of behavioural goals in controlling attention. However, everyday situations are multisensory and contain regularities, both likely influencing attention. We investigated how visual attentional capture is simultaneously impacted by top-down goals, the multisensory nature of stimuli, and the contextual factors of stimulis semantic relationship and temporal predictability. Participants performed a multisensory version of the Folk et al. (1992) spatial cueing paradigm, searching for a target of a predefined colour (e.g. a red bar) within an array preceded by a distractor. We manipulated: 1) stimulis goal-relevance via distractors colour (matching vs. mismatching the target), 2) stimulis multisensory nature (colour distractors appearing alone vs. with tones), 3) the relationship between the distractor sound and colour (arbitrary vs. semantically congruent) and 4) the temporal predictability of distractor onset. Reaction-time spatial cueing served as a behavioural measure of attentional selection. We also recorded 129-channel event-related potentials (ERPs), analysing the distractor-elicited N2pc component both canonically and using a multivariate electrical neuroimaging framework. Behaviourally, arbitrary target-matching distractors captured attention more strongly than semantically congruent ones, with no evidence for context modulating multisensory enhancements of capture. Notably, electrical neuroimaging of surface-level EEG analyses revealed context-based influences on attention to both visual and multisensory distractors, in how strongly they activated the brain and type of activated brain networks. For both processes, the context-driven brain response modulations occurred long before the N2pc time-window, with topographic (network-based) modulations at ~30ms, followed by strength-based modulations at ~100ms post-distractor onset. Our results reveal that both stimulus meaning and predictability modulate attentional selection, and they interact while doing so. Meaning, in addition to temporal predictability, is thus a second source of contextual information facilitating goal-directed behaviour. More broadly, in everyday situations, attention is controlled by an interplay between ones goals, stimulis perceptual salience, meaning and predictability. Our study calls for a revision of attentional control theories to account for the role of contextual and multisensory control.",

Root tropisms range from sensing gravity (gravitropism), light (phototropism), water (hydrotropism), touch (thigmotropism) and more. Electrotropism, also known as galvanotropism, is the phenomenon of aligning growth with external electric fields and currents. Although observed in a few species since the end of the 19th century, the molecular and physical mechanism of root electrotropism remains elusive, limiting the comparison to more defined sensing pathways in plants.\n\nHere we provide a first quantitative and molecular characterisation of root electrotropism in the model system Arabidopsis thaliana, showing that it does not depend on an asymmetric distribution of the plant hormone auxin, but that instead it requires the biosynthesis of a second hormone, cytokinin. We also show that the dose-response kinetics of the early steps of root electrotropism follows a power law analogous to the one observed in some physiological reactions in animals.\n\nA future full molecular and quantitative characterisation of root electrotropism would represent a step forward towards a better understanding of signal integration in plants, and an independent outgroup for comparative analysis of electroreception in animals and fungi.",

    "abstract": "Physics-based co-evolutionary models such as direct coupling analysis (DCA) in combination with machine learning (ML) techniques based on deep neural networks are able to predict protein contact maps with astonishing accuracy. Such contacts can be used as constraints in structure prediction and massively increase prediction accuracy. Unfortunately, the same ML methods cannot readily be applied to RNA as they rely on large structural datasets only available for proteins but not for RNAs. Here, we demonstrate how the small amount of data available for RNA can be used to significantly improve prediction of RNA contact maps. We introduce an algorithm called CoCoNet that is based on a combination of a Coevolutionary model and a shallow Convolutional Neural Network. Despite its simplicity and the small number of trained parameters, the method boosts the contact prediction accuracy by about 70% with respect to straightforward DCA as tested by cross-validation on a dataset of about sixty RNA structures. Both our extensive robustness tests and the limited number of parameters allow the generalization properties of our model. Finally, applications to other RNAs highlight the power of our approach.

    "abstract": "Human time perception is malleable and subject to many biases. For example, it has repeatedly been shown that stimuli that are physically intense or that are unexpected seem to last longer. Two hypotheses have been proposed to account for such biases: one states that these temporal illusions are the result of heightened arousal which speeds up neural clock dynamics, whereas the alternative  magnitude coding account states that the magnitude of sensory responses causally modulates perceived durations. Common experimental paradigms used to study temporal biases can not dissociate between these accounts, as arousal and sensory magnitude covary and modulate each other. Here, we present two temporal discrimination experiments where flashing stimuli demarcated the start and end of a to-be-timed interval. These stimuli could either be in the same or in a different location, which led to different sensory responses due to neural repetition suppression. Crucially, changes and repetitions were fully predictable, allowing us to explore effects of sensory response magnitude without changes in arousal or surprise. Intervals with changing markers were perceived as lasting longer than those with repeating markers. We measured EEG (Experiment 1) and pupil size (Experiment 2), and found that temporal perception related to changes in event-related potentials (P2) and pupil constriction, both of which have been related to responses in the sensory cortex. Conversely, correlates of surprise and arousal (P3 amplitude and pupil dilation) were unaffected by stimulus repetitions and changes. These results demonstrate that sensory magnitude affects time perception even under constant levels of arousal.",

    "abstract": "Cellular motility is an ancient eukaryotic trait, ubiquitous across phyla with roles in predator avoidance, resource access and competition. Flagellar-dependent motility is seen in a variety of parasitic protozoans and morphological changes in flagellar structure and function have been qualitatively described during differentiation. However, whether the dynamics of flagellar motion vary across lifecycle stages and whether such changes serve to facilitate human infection is not known. Here we used holographic video microscopy to study the pattern of motility in insect midgut forms of Leishmania (procyclic promastigotes; PCF) and differentiated human infective metacyclic promastigotes (META). We discovered that PCF swim in a slow, corkscrew motion around a gently curving axis while META display  run and tumble behaviour in the absence of stimulus, reminiscent of bacterial behaviour. In addition, we demonstrate that META specifically respond to a macrophage-derived stimulus, modifying swimming direction and speed to target host immune cells. Thus, the motility strategy employed by Leishmania appears as a random search that is replaced with a ballistic swimming motion in the presence of an immunological stimulus. These findings shed unique insights into how flagellar motion adapts to the particular needs of the parasite at different times in its lifecycle and define a new pre-adaptation for infection of the human host.",

    "abstract": "Madagascar is recognized both for its unparalleled biodiversity and the high level of threat suffered by this biodiversity, associated in particular with anthropogenic deforestation. Despite sustained efforts to fight poverty and curb deforestation, forest cover in Madagascar is rapidly decreasing. To try to explain why it is so difficult to stop deforestation in Madagascar, we analysed the recent deforestation process in Western Madagascar through satellite image analysis and field surveys. We show that deforestation has increased from less than 0.9%/yr on 2000-2010 to more than 2%/yr on 2010-2017. We identified two major causes of deforestation, which were not associated with subsistence agriculture: slash-and-burn agriculture for the cultivation of cash crops (maize and peanut), and uncontrolled fires to create open pasture. Maize production is mainly at the destination of the domestic market and is used in particular for livestock feeding. Peanut production has boomed since 2013 and more than half of it is now exported towards asiatic countries. The money earned by farmers is principally invested into zebu herd acquisition. Trade of agricultural commodities benefits several intermediaries, some of whom have political responsibilities thus creating conflicts of interest. On the other hand, agents from institutions in charge of the management of the protected areas have no means to enforce laws against deforestation. In the absence of an efficient strategy to stop deforestation, we predicted that 38-93% of the forest present in 2000 will have disappeared in 2050. Forest loss, apart from biodiversity loss and climate-change global issues, will be at the expense of local population. In order to stop deforestation, international aid should be used to improve local governance to enforce environmental laws and pressure should be put on trading companies to buy certified agricultural commodities that are not derived from deforestation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe increasing incidence of drug resistance in tuberculosis and other infectious diseases poses an escalating cause for concern, emphasizing the urgent need to devise robust computational and molecular methods identify drug resistant strains. Although machine learning-based approaches using whole-genome sequence data can facilitate the inference of drug resistance, current implementations do not optimally take advantage of information in public databases and are not robust for small sample sizes and mixed attribute types.\n\nResultsIn this paper we introduce the Composite MetaDistance method, an approach for feature selection and classification of high-dimensional, unbalanced datasets with mixed attribute features from various data sources. We introduce a mixed-attribute, multi-view distance function to calculate distances between samples, with optimal handling of nominal features and different feature views. We also introduce a novel feature set for drug resistance prediction in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, using data from diverse sources. We compare the performance of Composite MetaDistance to multiple machine learning algorithms for Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance prediction for three drugs. Composite MetaDistance consistently outperforms existing algorithms for small sample training sets, and performs as well as other algorithms for training sets with larger sample sizes.\n\nConclusionThe feature set formulation introduced in this paper is utilizes mutational and publicly available information for each gene, and is much richer than ever devised previously. The prediction algorithm, Composite MetaDistance, is sample size agnostic and robust especially given small sample sizes. Proper handling of nominal features improves performance even with a very small number of nominal features. We expect Composite MetaDistance to be even more robust for datasets with a higher percentage of nominal features. The algorithm is application independent and can be used for any mixed attribute dataset.",

    "abstract": "Using a sound-reward extinction paradigm in male rats, we reveal both cortical and subcortical sensory codes for the cue-specificity of memory. In the auditory cortex, re-tuning narrowed frequency receptive field bandwidth, yielding more precise extinction behavior cued by acoustic frequency. Subcortical signals revealed in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) showed decreases in amplitude of select components of the ABR wave. Interestingly, treatment with an inhibitor of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3-i) facilitated both auditory cortical tuning bandwidth changes and ABR changes that were frequency-specific to the extinguished signal sound. Moreover, both changes were correlated to each other and with highly precise extinction memory at the level of behavior. Thus, we show for the first time that HDAC3 regulates the specificity of sensory features consolidated in extinction memory. Overall, the dynamics of auditory system plasticity associated with sound-specific extinction are complex. Changes in ABR amplitude induced by sound-reward learning disappeared after extinction, while changes in ABR slope that were initially induced by sound-reward learning were maintained through extinction. Moreover, plasticity of cortical re-tuning emerged only after extinction learning. HDAC3-i applied after extinction training sessions enabled sensory system plasticity to encode the extinguished sound with higher acoustic specificity (compared to vehicle controls). Both cortical and subcortical response changes to sound became unusually \"tuned-in\" to the acoustic frequency that had been presented under extinction conditions. Thus, HDAC3 regulates how specifically sensory features of experience are encoded into long-term memory and may exert its behavioral effects via multiple coding strategies along sensory system pathways.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEpigenetic mechanisms have recently been implicated in memory and information processing. Here, we use a pharmacological inhibitor of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in a sensory model of learning to reveal, for the first time, its ability to enable unusually precise extinction memory. In so doing, we uncover neural coding strategies for memorys \"specificity\" for sensory cues. Extinction induced multiple forms of change at different levels of sensory processing, which highlights the complexity of extinction memory encoding. HDAC3 appears to coordinate effects across sensory levels that determine specific cue saliency for behavior. Thus, epigenetic players may gate how sensory information is stored in long-term memory and their manipulation can be leveraged to reveal neural coding mechanisms for sensory detail in memory.",

    "abstract": "Behavior relies on continuous influx of sensory information about the body and the environment. In primates, cortex integrates somatic feedback to accurately reach and manipulate objects. Yet, in many experimental regimes motor cortex seems paradoxically to operate as a feedforward, rather than feedback-driven, system. Here, we recorded simultaneously from motor and somatosensory cortex as monkeys performed a naturalistic reaching and object interaction behavior. We studied how unexpected feedback from behavioral errors influences cortical dynamics. Motor cortex generally exhibited robust feedforward dynamics, yet displayed feedback-driven dynamics surrounding correction of behavioral errors. We then decomposed motor cortical activity into orthogonal subspaces capturing communication with somatosensory cortex or behavior-generating dynamics. During error correction, the communication subspace became feedback-driven, while the behavioral subspace maintained feedforward dynamics. We therefore demonstrate that cortical activity is compartmentalized within distinct subspaces that shape the population dynamics, enabling flexible integration of salient inputs with ongoing activity for robust behavior.",

This degree of eye rotation (or vergence) is thought to play an essential role in size constancy, the process of perceiving an object as having a constant physical size despite changes in distance. But vergence size constancy has never been tested divorced from confounding cues such as changes in the retinal image. We control for these confounding cues and find no evidence of vergence size constancy. This has three important implications. First, we need a new explanation for binocular visions contribution to visual scale. Second, the vergence modulation of neurons in V1 can no longer be responsible for size constancy. Third, given the role attributed to vergence in multisensory integration, multisensory integration appears to be more reliant on cognitive factors than previous thought.",

However, that is rarely feasible due to the constraints imposed by standardized measures of reading ability which require test administration by trained clinicians or researchers. Here we explore whether a simple, two-alternative forced choice, time limited lexical decision task (LDT), self-delivered through the web-browser, can serve as an accurate and reliable measure of reading ability. We found that performance on the LDT is highly correlated with scores on standardized measures of reading ability such as the Woodcock-Johnson Letter Word Identification test (r = 0.91, disattenuated r = 0.94). Importantly, the LDT reading ability measure is highly reliable (r = 0.97). After optimizing the list of words and pseudowords based on item response theory, we found that a short experiment with 76 trials (2-3 minutes) provides a reliable (r = 0.95) measure of reading ability. Thus, the self-administered, Rapid Online Assessment of Reading ability (ROAR) developed here overcomes the constraints of resource-intensive, in-person reading assessment, and provides an efficient and automated tool for effective online research into the mechanisms of reading (dis)ability.",

    "abstract": "Rigorous assessment of the cellular and molecular changes during infection typically requires isolation of specific immune cell subsets for downstream application. While there are numerous options for enrichment/isolation of cells from tissues, fluorescent activated cell sorting (FACS) is accepted as a method that results in superior purification of a wide variety of cell types. Flow cytometry requires extensive fluidics and aerosol droplets can be generated during collection of target cells. Pathogens such as Francisella tularensis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Yersinia pestis, and SARS-CoV-2 require manipulation at biosafety level-3 (BSL-3). Due to the concern of potential aerosolization of these pathogens, use of flow cytometric-based cell sorting in these laboratory settings requires placement of the equipment in dedicated biosafety cabinets within the BSL-3. For many researchers, this is often not possible due to expense, space, or expertise available. Here we describe the safety validation and utility of a completely closed cell sorter that results in gentle, rapid, high purity, and safe sorting of cells on the benchtop at BSL-3. We also provide data demonstrating the need for cell sorting versus bead purification and the applicability of this technology for BSL-3 and potentially BSL-4 related infectious disease projects. Adoption of this technology will significantly expand our ability to uncover important features of the most dangerous infectious diseases leading to faster development of novel vaccines and therapeutics.",

Biofilms play a crucial role in survival in unfavourable environmental conditions, act as reservoirs of microbial contamination and antibiotic resistance. For intestinal pathogen Campylobacter jejuni, biofilms are considered to be a contributing factor in transmission through the food chain and currently, there are no known methods for intervention. Here we present an unconventional approach to reducing biofilm formation by C. jejuni by the application of D-amino acids (DAs), and L-amino acids (LAs). We found that DAs and not LAs, except L-alanine, reduced biofilm formation by up to 70%. The treatment of C. jejuni cells with DAs changed the biofilm architecture and reduced the appearance of amyloid-like fibrils. In addition, a mixture of DAs enhanced antimicrobial efficacy of D-Cycloserine (DCS) up to 32% as compared with DCS treatment alone. Unexpectedly, D-alanine was able to reverse the inhibitory effect of other DAs as well as that of DCS. Furthermore, L-alanine and D-tryptophan decreased transcript levels of peptidoglycan biosynthesis enzymes alanine racemase (alr) and D-alanine-D-alanine ligase (ddlA) while D-serine was only able to decrease the transcript levels of alr. Our findings suggest that a combination of DAs could reduce biofilm formation, viability and persistence of C. jejuni through dysregulation of alr and ddlA.",

Bacteria present in the oceanic water play an important role in ecology since they are responsible for decomposing, mineralizing of organic matter and in elemental cycling like nitrogen, sulfur, phosphate. This study focuses on culturing bacteria from oxygen minimum zones (OMZ) and non-OMZ regions and their phylogenetic as well as the functional characterization. Genotypic characterization of the isolates using amplified rDNA based 16SrRNA sequencing grouped them into various phylogenetic groups such as alpha-proteobacteria, gamma-proteobacteria and unaffiliated bacteria. The cultivable bacterial assemblages encountered belonged to the genus Halomonas, Marinobacter, Idiomarina, Pshyctobacter and Pseudoalteromonas. Among the enzymatic activities, carbohydrate utilization activity was most predominant (100%) and microorganisms possessed amylase, cellulase, xylanase and chitinase. A large proportion of these bacteria (60%) were observed to be hydrocarbon consuming and many were resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, kanamycin and streptomycin. The high diversity and high percentage of extracellular hydrolytic enzyme activities along with hydrocarbon degradation activity of the culturable bacteria reflects their important ecological role in oceanic biogeochemical cycling. Further assessment confirmed the presence of nitrogen reduction capability in these cultivable bacteria which highlights their importance in oceanic geochemical cycling.",

To examine how the neural ensemble activity of the nLOT is modulated by motivational processes that occur during various states of learned goal-directed behaviors, we recorded nLOT spike activities of mice performing odor-guided go/no-go tasks for obtaining a water reward. We found that the majority of the nLOT neurons exhibited sharp go-cue excitation and persistent no-go-cue inhibition responses triggered by an odor onset. The bi-directional cue encoding introduced nLOT population response dynamics and provided a high odor decoding accuracy before executing cue-odor-evoked behaviors. The go-cue preferred neurons were also activated in the reward drinking state, indicating context-based odor-outcome associations. These findings suggest that the nLOT neurons play an important role in the translation from context-based odor information to appropriate behavioral motivation.",

    "abstract": "A vital first step of RAF activation involves binding to active RAS, resulting in the recruitment of RAF to the plasma membrane. To understand the molecular details of RAS-RAF interaction, we solved crystal structures of wild-type and oncogenic mutants of KRAS complexed with the RAS-binding domain (RBD) and the membrane-interacting cysteine-rich domain (CRD) from the N-terminal regulatory region of RAF1. Our structures revealed that RBD and CRD interact with each other to form one structural entity in which both RBD and CRD interact extensively with KRAS. Mutation at the KRAS-CRD interface resulted in a significant reduction in RAF1 activation despite only a modest decrease in binding affinity. Combining our structures and published data, we provide a model of RAS-RAF complexation at the membrane, and molecular insights into RAS-RAF interaction during the process of RAS-mediated RAF activation.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic Dissociated Dorsal Root Ganglia cultures are often used to investigate the role of novel molecular pathways or drugs in Schwann cell development and myelination. These cultures largely recapitulate the order of cellular and molecular events that occur in Schwann cells of embryonic nerves. However, the timing of Schwann cell developmental transitions, notably the transition from Schwann Cell Precursors to immature Schwann cells and then to myelinating Schwann cells, has not been estimated so far in this culture system. In this study, we determined the expression profiles of Schwann cell developmental genes during the first week of culture and then compared our data to the expression profiles of these genes in developing spinal nerves. This helped in identifying that Schwann Cell Precursors transition into immature Schwann Cells between the 5th and 7th day in vitro. Furthermore, we also investigated the transition of immature cells into pro-myelinating and myelinating Schwann cells upon the induction of myelination in vitro. Our results suggest that Schwann cell differentiation beyond the immature stage can be observed as early as 4 days post the induction of myelination in cocultures. Finally, we compared the myelinating potential of coculture-derived Schwann cell monocultures to cultures established from neonatal sciatic nerves and found that both these cultures system exhibit similar myelinating phenotypes. In effect, our results allow for a better understanding and interpretation of coculture experiments especially in studies that aim to elucidate the role of a novel actor in Schwann Cell development and myelination.",

    "abstract": "It is a broadly observed pattern that the non-recombining regions of sex-limited chromosomes (Y and W) accumulate more repeats than the rest of the genome, even in species like birds with a low genome-wide repeat content. Here we show that in birds with highly heteromorphic sex chromosomes, the W chromosome has a transposable element (TE) density of >55% compared to the genome-wide density of <10%, and contains over half of all full-length (thus potentially active) endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) of the entire genome. Using RNA-seq and protein mass spectrometry data, we were able to detect signatures of female-specific ERV expression. We hypothesise that the avian W chromosome acts as a refugium for active ERVs, likely leading to female-biased mutational load that may influence female physiology similar to the \"toxic-Y\" effect in Drosophila. Furthermore, Haldanes rule predicts that the heterogametic sex has reduced fertility in hybrids. We propose that the excess of W-linked active ERVs over the rest of the genome may be an additional explanatory variable for Haldanes rule, with consequences for genetic incompatibilities between species through TE/repressor mismatches in hybrids. Together, our results suggest that the sequence content of female-specific W chromosomes can have effects far beyond sex determination and gene dosage.",

Here, we demonstrate the Drosophila EJC suppresses hundreds of functional cryptic splice sites (SS), even though majority of these bear weak splicing motifs and appear incompetent. Mechanistically, the EJC directly conceals splicing elements through position-specific recruitment, preventing SS definition. We note that intron removal using strong, canonical SS yields AG|GU signatures at exon-exon junctions. Unexpectedly, we discover that scores of these minimal exon junction sequences are in fact EJC-suppressed 5 and 3 recursive SS, and that loss of EJC regulation from such transcripts triggers faulty mRNA resplicing. An important corollary is that intronless cDNA expression constructs from aforementioned targets yield high levels of unanticipated, truncated transcripts generated by resplicing. Consequently, we conclude the EJC has ancestral roles to defend transcriptome fidelity by (1) repressing illegitimate splice sites on pre-mRNAs, and (2) preventing inadvertent activation of such sites on spliced segments.",

We identified a population of IL1B+ antimicrobial macrophages and FOXP3/+BATF+ T cells that are associated and expanded in inflamed tissues, which we further validated in other scRNA-seq datasets from IBD patients.

    "abstract": "2.Trimethoprim is a synthetic antibacterial agent that targets folate biosynthesis by competitively binding to the di-hydrofolate reductase enzyme (DHFR). Trimethoprim is often administered synergistically with sulfonamide, another chemotherapeutic agent targeting the di-hydro-pteroate synthase (DHPS) enzyme in the same pathway. Clinical resistance to both drugs is widespread and mediated by enzyme variants capable of performing their biological function without binding to these drugs. These mutant enzymes were assumed to have arisen after the discovery of these synthetic drugs, but recent work has shown that genes conferring resistance to sulfonamide were present in the bacterial pangenome millions of years ago. Here we apply phylogenetics and comparative genomics methods to study the largest family of mobile trimethoprim resistance genes (dfrA). We show that most of the dfrA genes identified to date map to two large clades that likely arose from independent mobilization events. In contrast to sulfonamide resistance (sul) genes, we find evidence of recurrent mobilization in dfrA genes. Phylogenetic evidence allows us to identify novel dfrA genes in the emerging pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, and we confirm their resistance phenotype in vitro. We also identify a cluster of dfrA homologs in cryptic plasmid and phage genomes, but we show that these enzymes do not confer resistance to trimethoprim. Our methods also allow us to pinpoint the chromosomal origin of previously reported dfrA genes, and we show that many of these ancient chromosomal genes also confer resistance to trimethoprim. Our work reveals that trimethoprim resistance predated the clinical use of this chemotherapeutic agent, but that novel mutations have likely also arisen and become mobilized following its widespread use within and outside the clinic. This work hence confirms that resistance to novel drugs may already be present in the bacterial pangenome, and stresses the importance of rapid mobilization as a fundamental element in the emergence and global spread of resistance determinants.\n\n3. Impact statementAntibiotic resistance is a pressing and global phenomenon. It is well-established that resistance to conventional antibiotics emerged millions of years ago in either antibiotic-producing bacteria or their competitors. Resistance to synthetic chemotherapeutic agents cannot be explained by this paradigm, since these drugs are not naturally produced. Resistance is hence assumed to have evolved rapidly following the clinical introduction of these drugs. Recently we showed that resistance to one such drug, sulfonamide, evolved not recently, but millions of years ago, suggesting that the diversity of bacterial genomes may well contain genes conferring resistance to drugs yet to be developed. Here we analyze the origin of resistance to trimethoprim, another chemotherapeutic agent developed in the 1960s. Using phylogenetic methods, we identify new variants of the trimethoprim resistance genes that had not previously been reported, and we trace the chromosomal origins for a number of already known resistance variants. Our results show that resistance to trimethoprim is very diverse and has originated both from recent mutations and from preexisting ancient variants. These results stress the importance of gene mobilization mechanisms as the main drivers of the current antibiotic resistance phenomenon.\n\n4.

    "abstract": "After the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), iron availability was greatly decreased and photosynthetic organisms evolved several alternative proteins and mechanisms. One of these proteins, plastocyanin, is a type I blue-copper protein that can replace cytochrome c6 as a soluble electron carrier between cytochrome b6f and photosystem I. In most cyanobacteria, expression of these two alternative proteins is regulated by copper availability, but the regulatory system remains unknown. Herein, we provide evidence that the regulatory system is composed of a BlaI/CopY family transcription factor (PetR) and a BlaR membrane protease (PetP). PetR represses petE (plastocyanin) expression and activates petJ (cytochrome c6), while PetP controls PetR levels in vivo. Using whole-cell extracts, we demonstrated that PetR degradation requires both PetP and copper. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the PetRP system regulates only four genes (petE, petJ, slr0601, and slr0602), highlighting its specificity. Furthermore, the presence of petE and petRP in early branching cyanobacteria indicates that acquisition of these genes could represent an early adaptation to decreased iron bioavailability following the GOE.\n\nSignificance StatementAfter the appearance of oxygenic photosynthesis, Fe became oxidized and its solubility and availability were greatly decreased. This generated a problem for most organisms since they are strongly dependent on Fe, especially photosynthetic organisms. In response, organisms evolved alternatives to Fe-containing proteins such as plastocyanin, a copper protein that substitutes for cytochrome c6 in photosynthesis. Expression of these two proteins in cyanobacteria is regulated by Cu availability, but the regulatory system remains unknown. Herein, we describe the regulatory system for these alternative proteins in photosynthesis in cyanobacteria. The mechanism involves a transcription factor (PetR) and a membrane protease (PetP) that degrades PetR in the presence of Cu.",

SOCS1 mediates its functions by inhibiting tyrosine kinases, promoting ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of signal transducing proteins, and by modulating transcription factors. Here, we studied the impact of SOCS1 on the hepatocyte proteome using Stable Isotopic Labelling of Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC)-based mass spectrometry on the Hepa1-6 murine HCC cell line stably expressing wildtype SOCS1 or a mutant SOCS1 with impaired SH2 domain. As SOCS1 regulates the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor MET, the SILAC-labelled cells were stimulated or not with HGF. Following mass spectrometry analysis, differentially modulated proteins were identified, quantified and analyzed for pathway enrichment. Of the 3440 proteins identified in Hepa-SOCS1 cells at steady state, 181 proteins were significantly modulated compared to control cells. The SH2 domain mutation and HGF increased the number of differentially modulated proteins. Protein interaction network analysis revealed enrichment of SOCS1-modulated proteins within multiprotein complexes such as ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, proteasome, mRNA spliceosome, mRNA exosome and mitochondrial ribosome. These findings suggest that SOCS1, induced by cytokines, growth factors and diverse other stimuli, may dynamically modulate of large macromolecular regulatory complexes to help maintain cellular homeostasis. Notably, the expression of UBE2D ubiquitin conjugating enzyme, which is implicated in the control of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, was found to be regulated by SOCS1.",

We report the effects of hypoxia on the generation of mitochondrial dsRNA (mtdsRNA) in breast cancer. We found a significant decrease in dsRNA production in different cell lines under hypoxia. This was HIF1/2-independent. mtdsRNA was responsible for induction of type I IFN and significantly decreased after hypoxia.

    "abstract": "Seasonal influenza viruses repeatedly infect humans in part because they rapidly change their antigenic properties and evade host immune responses, necessitating frequent updates of the vaccine composition. Accurate predictions of strains circulating in the future could therefore improve the vaccine match. Here, we studied the predictability of frequency dynamics and fixation of amino acid substitutions. Current frequency was the strongest predictor of eventual fixation, as expected in neutral evolution. Other properties, such as occurrence in previously characterized epitopes or high Local Branching Index (LBI) had little predictive power. Parallel evolution was found to be moderately predictive of fixation. While the LBI had little power to predict frequency dynamics, it was still successful at picking strains representative of future populations. The latter is due to a tendency of the LBI to be high for consensus-like sequences that are closer to the future than the average sequence. Simulations of models of adapting populations, in contrast, show clear signals of predictability. This indicates that the evolution of influenza HA and NA, while driven by strong selection pressure to change, is poorly described by common models of directional selection such as travelling fitness waves.",

    "abstract": "Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC) is a severe neurovisceral disorder that is pathophysiologically characterized by intracellular transport abnormalities leading to cytoplasmic accumulation of lipids such as cholesterol and multiple sphingolipids, including sphingosine. The compound 2-hydroxypropyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin (HP{beta}CD) is a compound with high cholesterol complexation capacity and is currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of NPC. However, due to its short blood half-life, high doses are required to produce a therapeutic effect. It has been reported in mice that HP{beta}CDs circulation time and efficacy can be improved by increasing its size via polymerization, but the biodegradable nature of these systems did not allow the contribution of the macromolecule to the activity to be determined. In this work, stable forms of polymerized HP{beta}CD were generated (via epichlorohydrin crosslinking) to investigate their in vitro mechanisms of action and in vivo effects. Crosslinked CDs (8-312 kDa) displayed a 10-fold greater complexation capacity towards cholesterol than monomeric HP{beta}CD but were taken up by cells to a lower extent (in a size-dependent fashion), resulting in an overall comparable in vitro effect on intracellular cholesterol accumulation that was dependent on cholesterol complexation. When tested in vivo, the crosslinked 19.3 kDa HP{beta}CD exhibited a longer terminal half-life than the monomeric HP{beta}CD. However, it did not increase the life span of Npc1 mice, possibly due to reduced organ penetration and brain diffusion consequence of its large molecular weight. This could be circumvented by the application of magnetic resonance imaging-guided low intensity-pulsed focused ultrasound (MRIg-FUS), which increased the brain penetration of the CD. In conclusion, stable forms of polymerized HP{beta}CD constitute valuable tools to elucidate CDs mechanism of action. Moreover, the use of MRIg-FUS to maximize CDs tissue penetration warrants further investigation, as it may be key to harnessing CDs full therapeutic potential in the treatment of NPC.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/230136v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3dbaf1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bc255dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@390e7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e5e5c5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG The 2-hydroxypropyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin (HP{beta}CD) is a well-established pharmaceutical excipient that can complex cholesterol and is currently under clinical investigation to treat Niemann-Pick Disease Type C (NPC).

    "abstract": "MotivationInfluenza viruses are persistently threatening public health, causing annual epidemics and sporadic pandemics. The evolution of influenza viruses remains to be the main obstacle in the effectiveness of antiviral treatments due to rapid mutations. Previous work has been investigated to reveal the determinants of virulence of the influenza A virus. To further facilitate flu surveillance, explicit detection of influenza virulence is crucial to protect public health from potential future pandemics.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we propose a weighted ensemble convolutional neural network for the virulence prediction of influenza A viruses named VirPreNet that uses all 8 segments. Firstly, mouse lethal dose 50 is exerted to label the virulence of infections into two classes, namely avirulent and virulent. A numerical representation of amino acids named ProtVec is applied to the 8-segments in a distributed manner to encode the biological sequences. After splittings and embeddings of influenza strains, the ensemble convolutional neural network is constructed as the base model on the influenza dataset of each segment, which serves as the VirPreNets main part. Followed by a linear layer, the initial predictive outcomes are integrated and assigned with different weights for the final prediction. The experimental results on the collected influenza dataset indicate that VirPreNet achieves state-of-the-art performance combining ProtVec with our proposed architecture. It outperforms baseline methods on the independent testing data. Moreover, our proposed model reveals the importance of PB2 and HA segments on the virulence prediction. We believe that our model may provide new insights into the investigation of influenza virulence.\n\nContactyinr0002@e.ntu.edu.sg\n\nAvailability and ImplementationCodes and data to generate the VirPreNet are publicly available at https://github.com/Rayin-saber/VirPreNet",

    "abstract": "Neutrophilic granulocytes are required for antimicrobial defense, but they can also be harmful to the host organism. The current study demonstrates that disordered peptides in the 3-12 kDa size range in the plasma of septic patients alter effector functions of neutrophils from healthy donors. Those peptides stimulated exocytosis, increased extracellular release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased ROS production in phagosomes, and impaired elimination of ROS-sensitive bacteria. Both the concentration of peptides in patients plasma and their effects on healthy cells were proportional to the clinical status of the patients. Proteomic analysis and in silico modeling indicate that multiple proteases generate the toxic peptides, with the greatest number of peptides cleaved by neutrophil elastase. We propose that neutrophils participate in an amplification loop in which proteolytic peptides stimulate extracellular release of proteases, resulting in production of more peptides. The enhanced extracellular ROS release contributes to tissue damage, while reduced intracellular ROS generation impairs elimination of certain bacteria. Breaking of this vicious cycle may offer a potential target for intervention.",

    "abstract": "Technologies for measuring 3D genome topology are increasingly important for studying mechanisms of gene regulation, for genome assembly and for mapping of genome rearrangements. Hi-C and other ligation-based methods have become routine but have specific biases. Here, we develop multiplex-GAM, a faster and more affordable version of Genome Architecture Mapping (GAM), a ligation-free technique to map chromatin contacts genome-wide. We perform a detailed comparison of contacts obtained by multiplex-GAM and Hi-C using mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. We find that both methods detect similar topologically associating domains (TADs). However, when examining the strongest contacts detected by either method, we find that only one third of these are shared. The strongest contacts specifically found in GAM often involve \"active\" regions, including many transcribed genes and super-enhancers, whereas in Hi-C they more often contain \"inactive\" regions. Our work shows that active genomic regions are involved in extensive complex contacts that currently go under-estimated in genome-wide ligation-based approaches, and highlights the need for orthogonal advances in genome-wide contact mapping technologies.",

    "abstract": "In the central nervous system, many neurons develop axonal arbors that are crucial for information processing. Previous studies have demonstrated that premature axons contain motile and stationary mitochondria, and their balance is important for axonal arborization. However, the mechanisms by which neurons determine the positions of stationary mitochondria as well as their turnover remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the regulation of spatiotemporal group dynamics of stationary mitochondria. We observed that the distribution of stationary mitochondrial spots along the unmyelinated and nonsynaptic axons is not random but rather relatively uniform both in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, whereas the positions of each mitochondrial spot changed over time, the overall distribution remained uniform. In addition, local inactivation of mitochondria inhibited the translocation of mitochondrial spots in adjacent axonal regions, suggesting that functional mitochondria enhance the motility of neighboring mitochondria. Furthermore, we showed that the ATP concentration was relatively high around mitochondria, and treating axons with phosphocreatine, which supplies ATP, reduced the immobile mitochondria induced by local mitochondrial inhibition. These observations indicate that intermitochondrial interactions, mediated by ATP signaling, control the uniform distribution of axonal mitochondria. The present study reveals a novel cellular system that collectively regulates stationary mitochondria in axons.",

    "abstract": "The accumulation of damaged mitochondria due to insufficient autophagy has been implicated in the pathophysiology of sarcopenia resulting in reduced contractile and metabolic function. Ulk1 is an autophagy-related kinase that initiates autophagosome assembly and may also play a role in autophagosome degradation (i.e., autophagy flux), but the contribution of Ulk1 to healthy muscle aging is unclear. We found that Ulk1 phosphorylation declines in both human and mouse muscle tissue with age, therefore the purpose of this study was to investigate the role of Ulk1-mediated autophagy in skeletal muscle aging. At age 22 months (80% survival rate), muscle contractile and metabolic function were assessed using electrophysiology in muscle specific Ulk1 knockout mice (MKO) and their littermate controls (LM). Specific peak-isometric torque of the ankle dorsiflexors (normalized by tibialis anterior muscle cross-sectional area) and specific force of the fast-twitch extensor digitorum longus muscles were reduced in MKO mice compared to LM mice (p<0.03). Permeabilized muscle fibers from MKO mice had greater mitochondrial content, yet lower mitochondrial oxygen consumption and greater reactive oxygen species production compared to fibers from LM mice (p[&le;] 0.04). Altered neuromuscular junction innervation patterns and changes in autophagosome numbers and/or flux in muscles from MKO may have contributed to decrements in contractile and metabolic function. Results from this study support an important role of Ulk1-mediated autophagy in skeletal muscle with age, reflecting Ulk1s dual role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity through autophagosome assembly and degradation. A lifetime of insufficient Ulk-1-mediated autophagy in skeletal muscle exacerbates age-related contractile and metabolic dysfunction.",

We interrogated cohesin architecture, oligomerization state and function of cohesin oligomers in vivo through proximity-dependent labeling of cohesin domains. Our results suggest that the hinge and head domains of cohesin both bind DNA, and that cohesin coiled coils bend, bringing the head and hinge together to form a butterfly conformation. Our data also suggest that cohesin efficiently oligomerizes on and off DNA. The levels of oligomers and their distribution on chromosomes are cell cycle regulated. Cohesin oligomerization is blocked by mutations in distinct domains of Smc3p and Mcd1p, or depletion of Pds5p. This unusual subset of mutations specifically blocks the maintenance of cohesion and condensation, suggesting that cohesin oligomerization plays a critical role in these biological functions.",

We describe the application of ratiometric fluorescent pH-sensitive nanosensors, as a novel tool, to observe physiological pH changes in biofilms in real-time. Nanosensors comprised two pH-sensitive fluorophores covalently encapsulated with a reference pH-insensitive fluorophore in an inert polyacrylamide nanoparticle matrix. The nanosensors were used to analyse the real-time three-dimensional pH variation for two model biofilm formers: (i) opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and (ii) oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans.

    "abstract": "Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) such as dengue, Zika and chikungunya constitute a significant proportion of the global disease burden. The principal vector of these pathogens is the mosquito Aedes (Ae.) aegypti, and its ability to transmit virus to a human host is influenced by environmental factors such as temperature. However, exactly how ambient temperature influences virus replication within mosquitoes remains poorly elucidated, particularly at the molecular level. Here, we use chikungunya virus (CHIKV) as a model to understand how the host mosquito transcriptome responds to arbovirus infection under different ambient temperatures. We exposed CHIKV-infected mosquitoes to 18 {degrees}C, 28 {degrees}C and 32 {degrees}C, and found higher temperature correlated with higher virus replication levels, particularly at early time points post-infection. Lower ambient temperatures resulted in reduced virus replication levels. Using RNAseq, we found that temperature significantly altered gene expression levels in mosquitoes, particularly components of the immune response. The highest number of significantly differentially expressed genes in response to CHIKV was observed at 28 {degrees}C, with a markedly more muted effect observed at either lower (18 {degrees}C) or higher (32 {degrees}C) temperatures. At the higher temperature, the expression of many classical immune genes, including Dicer-2 in the RNAi pathway, was not substantially altered in response to CHIKV. Upregulation of Toll, IMD and JAK-STAT pathways was only observed at 28 {degrees}C. Time post infection also led to substantially different gene expression profiles, and this effect varied depending upon the which temperature mosquitoes were exposed to. Taken together, our data indicate temperature significantly modulates mosquito gene expression in response to infection, potentially leading to impairment of immune defences at higher ambient temperatures.",

    "abstract": "PurposeAbnormal human trabecular meshwork (HTM) cell function and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling contribute to HTM stiffening in primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Most current cellular HTM model systems do not sufficiently replicate the complex native three dimensional (3D) cell-ECM interface, which makes them less than ideal to investigate POAG pathology. Tissue-engineered protein-based hydrogels are ideally positioned to overcome shortcomings of current models. Here, we report a novel biomimetic HTM hydrogel and test its utility as a POAG disease model.\n\nMethodsHTM hydrogels were engineered by mixing normal donor-derived HTM cells with collagen type I, elastin-like polypeptide and hyaluronic acid, each containing photoactive functional groups, followed by UV light-activated free-radical crosslinking. Glaucomatous conditions were induced with dexamethasone (DEX), and therapeutic effects of the Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y27632 on cytoskeletal organization and tissue-level function, contingent on HTM cell-ECM interactions, were assessed.\n\nResultsDEX exposure increased HTM hydrogel contractility, f-actin and alpha smooth muscle actin abundance and rearrangement, ECM remodeling, and fibronectin and collagen type IV deposition, all contributing to HTM hydrogel condensation and stiffening consistent with recent data from normal vs. glaucomatous HTM tissue. Y27632 treatment produced precisely the opposite effects and attenuated the DEX-induced pathologic changes, resulting in HTM hydrogel relaxation and softening.\n\nConclusionsWe have developed a biomimetic HTM hydrogel model for detailed investigation of 3D cell-ECM interactions under normal and simulated glaucomatous conditions. Its bidirectional responsiveness to pharmaceutical challenge and rescue suggests promising potential to serve as screening platform for new POAG treatments with focus on HTM biomechanics.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory T cells (Treg) are critical mediators of self-tolerance but can also limit effective anti-tumor immunity. We and others previously reported that 40-60% percent of Treg-infiltrating head and neck cancer (HNC) and other tumors highly express Tim-3, compared with about 5% in lymphoid organs. Tumor-infiltrating Tim-3+ Treg also have enhanced suppressive function and display a more effector-like phenotype. Using a novel mouse model with cell type-specific Tim-3 expression, we show here that expression of Tim-3 by Treg is sufficient to drive Treg to a more effector-like phenotype, resulting in enhanced suppressive activity and increased tumor growth. These findings may help to reconcile previous reports that some Tim-3 antibodies enhance T cell responses in vivo, while expression of Tim-3 has a cell-intrinsic ability to enhance TCR signaling and T cell activation. Thus, we propose that Tim-3 regulates anti-tumor immunity at least in part through enhancement of Treg function. To our knowledge, this is the first example in which expression of a single co-stimulatory molecule is sufficient to drive differentiation of Treg in this manner.",

    "abstract": "The synthesis of Indole Acetic Acid from tryptophan has been described in plants, fungi and bacteria; it is thus known as tryptophan-dependent indole acetic acid. Four possible pathways of IAA formation have been described, including the indole acetonitrile acid (IAN), indole acetamide (IAM), indole-pyruvic (IAP) and tryptamine (TRM) pathways. Of these, the indole acetonitrile pathway is particularly important because when this compound is transformed into IAA, a nitrogenated molecule is released. The microorganisms that have this pathway are thus called nitrogen fixers. There is another little-studied pathway called TRP-Independent, so-called because the IAA that is formed in it can have an exogenous origin, chorismic acid (CHA), and it enters the pathway through anthranilic acid (ANA). The TRP-Independent pathway is made up of three stages. The first from CHA to ANA, the second from AA to IAA and the third from TRP to ANA through Kynurenine (KYN). This work describes the different stages of the pathway, as well as the enzymes and the genes that control the production of IAA, using a bioinformatic analysis of the genes involved, which were identified by PCR. An expression analysis showed that only T asperellum has the necessary genes to incorporate ANA into the TRP-I pathway and synthesize IAA through it. The analysis also detected the gene that regulates anthranilate phosphoribosyl transferase (AFT), an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of AIA from ANA; the presence of this gene was confirmed in the two species analyzed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundArboviral diseases including dengue and chikungunya are major public health concern in Bangladesh, with unprecedented levels of transmission reported in recent years. The primary approach to control these diseases is control of Aedes aegypti using pyrethroid insecticides. Although chemical control is long-practiced, no comprehensive analysis of Ae. aegypti susceptibility to insecticides has previously been conducted. This study aimed to determine the insecticide resistance status of Ae. aegypti in Bangladesh and investigate the role of detoxification enzymes and altered target site sensitivity as resistance mechanisms.\n\nMethodsAedes eggs were collected using ovitraps from five districts across the country and in eight neighborhoods of the capital city Dhaka from August to November 2017. CDC bottle bioassays were conducted for permethrin, deltamethrin, malathion, and bendiocarb using 3-5-day old F0-F2 non-blood fed female mosquitoes. Biochemical assays were conducted to detect metabolic resistance mechanisms and real-time PCR was performed to determine the frequencies of the knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations Gly1016, Cys1534, and Leu410.\n\nResultsHigh levels of resistance to permethrin were detected in all Ae. aegypti populations, with mortality ranging from 0 - 14.8% at the diagnostic dose. Substantial resistance continued to be detected against higher (2X) doses of permethrin (5.1 - 44.4% mortality). Susceptibility to deltamethrin and malathion varied between populations while complete susceptibility to bendiocarb was observed in all populations. Significantly higher levels of esterase and oxidase activity were detected in most of the test populations as compared to the susceptible reference Rockefeller strain. A significant association was detected between permethrin resistance and the presence of Gly1016 and Cys1534 homozygotes. The frequency of kdr alleles varied across the Dhaka populations, and Leu410 was not detected in any of the tested populations.\n\nConclusionsThe detection of widespread pyrethroid resistance and multiple mechanisms highlights the urgency for implementing alternate Ae. aegypti control strategies. In addition, implementing routine monitoring of insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti in Bangladesh will lead to a greater understanding of susceptibility trends over space and time, thereby enabling the development of improved control strategies.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of multidrug resistance (MDR) is a pressing public health concern. Yet many aspects, such as the role played by population structure, remain poorly understood. Here we argue that studying MDR evolution by focusing upon the dynamical equations for linkage disequilibrium (LD) can greatly simplify the calculations, generate more insight, and provide a unified framework for understanding the role of population structure. We demonstrate how a general epidemiological model of MDR evolution can be recast in terms of the LD equations. These equations reveal how the different forces generating and propagating LD operate in a dynamical setting at both the population and metapopulation levels. We then apply these insights to show how the LD perspective: (i) explains equilibrium patterns of MDR, (ii) provides a simple interpretative framework for transient evolutionary dynamics, and (iii) can be used to assess the consequences of different drug prescription strategies for MDR evolution.",

    "abstract": "Kupffer cells (KCs) originate from yolk sac progenitors before birth. Throughout adulthood, they self-maintain independently from the input of circulating monocytes (MOs) at stead state, and are replenished within 2 weeks after having been depleted, but the origin of repopulating KCs in adult remains unclear. The current paradigm dictates that repopulating KCs originate from preexisting KCs or monocytes, but there remains a lack of fate-mapping evidence. In current study, we firstly traced the fate of preexisting KCs and that of monocytic cells with tissue-resident macrophage-specific and monocytic cell-specific fate mapping mouse models, respectively, and found no evidences that repopulating KCs originate from preexisting KCs or MOs. Secondly, we performed genetic lineage tracing to determine the type of progenitor cells involved in response to KC depletion in mice, and found that in response to KC depletion, hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) proliferated in the bone marrow, mobilized into the blood, adoptively transferred into the liver and differentiated into KCs. Finally, we traced the fate of HSCs in a HSC-specific fate-mapping mouse model, in context of chronic liver inflammation induced by repeated carbon tetrachloride treatment, and confirmed that repopulating KCs originated directly from HSCs. Taken together, these findings provided strong in vivo fate-mapping evidences that repopulating KCs originate directly from Hematopoietic stem cells not from preexisting KCs or from MOs.\n\nSignificanceThere is a standing controversy in the field regarding the cellular origin of repopulating macrophages. This paper provides strong in vivo fate-mapping evidences that repopulating KCs originate directly from hematopoietic stem cells not from preexisting KCs or from MOs, which presenting a completely novel understanding of the cellular origin of repopulating Kupffer Cells and shedding light on the divergent roles of KCs in liver homeostasis and diseases.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are an integral part of the host transcriptome. TE-containing noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) exhibit considerable tissue specificity and play crucial roles during development, including stem cell maintenance and cell differentiation. Recent advances in single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) revolutionized cell-type specific gene expression analysis. However, scRNA-seq quantification tools tailored for TEs are lacking, limiting our ability to dissect TE expression dynamics at single cell resolution. To address this issue, we established a TE expression quantification pipeline that is compatible with scRNA-seq data generated across multiple technology platforms. We constructed TE containing ncRNA references using bulk RNA-seq data and demonstrated that quantifying TE expression at the transcript level effectively reduces noise. As proof of principle, we applied this strategy to mouse embryonic stem cells and successfully captured the expression profile of endogenous retroviruses in single cells. We further expanded our analysis to scRNA-seq data from early stages of mouse embryogenesis. Our results illustrated the dynamic TE expression at pre-implantation stages and revealed 137 TE-containing ncRNA transcripts with substantial tissue specificity during gastrulation and early organogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Study objectivesWhile poor sleep quality has been related to increased risk of Alzheimers disease, long-time shift workers (maritime pilots) did not manifest evidence of early Alzheimers disease in a recent study. We explored two hypotheses of possible compensatory mechanisms for sleep disruption: Increased efficiency in generating deep sleep during workweeks (model 1) and rebound sleep during rest weeks (model 2).\n\nMethodsWe used data from ten male maritime pilots (mean age: 51.6{+/-}2.4 years) with a history of approximately 18 years of irregular shift work. Subjective sleep quality was assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). A single lead EEG-device was used to investigate sleep in the home/work environment, quantifying total sleep time (TST), deep sleep time (DST), and deep sleep time percentage (DST%). Using multilevel models, we studied the sleep architecture of maritime pilots over time, at the transition of a workweek to a rest week.\n\nResultsMaritime pilots reported worse sleep quality in workweeks compared to rest weeks (PSQI=8.2{+/-}2.2 vs. 3.9{+/-}2.0; p<0.001). Model 1 showed a trend towards an increase in DST% of 0.6% per day during the workweek (p=0.08). Model 2 did not display an increase in DST% in the rest week (p=0.87).\n\nConclusionsOur findings indicated that increased efficiency in generating deep sleep during workweeks is a more likely compensatory mechanism for sleep disruption in the maritime pilot cohort than rebound sleep during rest weeks. Compensatory mechanisms for poor sleep quality might mitigate sleep disruption-related risk of developing Alzheimers disease. These results should be used as a starting point for future studies including larger, more diverse populations of shift workers.",

The primary outcomes included hospital admission and adverse events. A random effects model with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used. Subgroup analysis was performed according to age, severity of asthma, and co-interventions with other asthma controllers. This study was registered with PROSPERO.\n\nResultsOf the 637 studies that were identified, 55 met the inclusion criteria and involved 6396 participants. IB + salbutamol significantly reduced the risk of hospital admission compared with salbutamol alone (risk ratio [RR] 0.79; 95% CI 0.66-0.95; p = 0.01; I2 = 40%). Subgroup analysis only showed significant difference in the risk of hospital admission in participants with severe asthma exacerbation (RR 0.71; 95% CI 0.60-0.85; p = 0.0001; I2 = 0%) and moderate-to-severe exacerbation (RR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.96; p = 0.03; I2 = 3%). There were no significant differences in the risk of adverse events between IB + salbutamol group and salbutamol alone group (RR 1.77; 95% CI 0.63-4.98).\n\nConclusionIB + salbutamol may be more effective than salbutamol alone for the treatment of asthma in children and adolescents, especially in those with severe and moderate to severe asthma exacerbation.

    "abstract": "Mathematical models of metabolic networks utilize simulation to study system-level mechanisms and functions. Various approaches have been used to model the steady state behavior of metabolic networks using genome-scale reconstructions, but formulating dynamic models from such reconstructions continues to be a key challenge. Here, we present the Mass Action Stoichiometric Simulation Python (MASSpy) package, an open-source computational framework for dynamic modeling of metabolism. MASSpy utilizes mass action kinetics and detailed chemical mechanisms to build dynamic models of complex biological processes. MASSpy adds dynamic modeling tools to the COnstraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis Python (COBRApy) package to provide an unified framework for constraint-based and kinetic modeling of metabolic networks. MASSpy supports high-performance dynamic simulation through its implementation of libRoadRunner; the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) simulation engine. Three case studies demonstrate how to use MASSpy: 1) to simulate dynamics of detailed mechanisms of enzyme regulation; 2) to generate an ensemble of kinetic models using Monte Carlo sampling to approximate missing numerical values of parameters and to quantify uncertainty, and 3) to overcome issues that arise when integrating experimental data with the computation of functional states of detailed biological mechanisms. MASSpy represents a powerful tool to address challenge that arise in dynamic modeling of metabolic networks, both at a small and large scale.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenome-scale reconstructions of metabolism appeared shortly after the first genome sequences became available. Constraint-based models are widely used to compute steady state properties of such reconstructions, but the attainment of dynamic models has remained elusive. We thus developed the MASSpy software package, a framework that enables the construction, simulation, and visualization of dynamic metabolic models. MASSpy is based on the mass action kinetics for each elementary step in an enzymatic reaction mechanism. MASSpy seamlessly unites existing software packages within its framework to provide the user with various modeling tools in one package. MASSpy integrates community standards to facilitate the exchange of models, giving modelers the freedom to use the software for different aspects of their own modeling workflows. Furthermore, MASSpy contains methods for generating and simulating ensembles of models, and for explicitly accounting for biological uncertainty. MASSpy has already demonstrated success in a classroom setting. We anticipate that the suite of modeling tools incorporated into MASSpy will enhance the ability of the modeling community to construct and interrogate complex dynamic models of metabolism.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe Pinyon Jay is a highly-social, year-round inhabitant of pinyon-juniper woodlands in the western United States. Range-wide, Pinyon Jays have declined ~ 3 - 4% per year for at least the last half-century. At the same time, large acreages of pinyon-juniper woodland have been removed or thinned to improve habitat for Greater Sage-Grouse or other game species across much of the Great Basin, which is home to nearly half of the global population of Pinyon Jays. Occupancy patterns and habitat use of Pinyon Jays have not been well characterized across much of the species range, and obtaining this information is necessary for better understanding the causes of ongoing declines and determining useful conservation strategies. Our goal of this study was to identify the characteristics of areas used by Pinyon Jays for several critical life history components and to thereby facilitate the inclusion of Pinyon Jay conservation measures in the design of vegetation management projects. To accomplish this, we studied Pinyon Jays in three widely separated study areas using radio telemetry and direct observation, and measured key attributes of their locations and a separate set of randomly-selected control sites using the U. S. Forest Services Forest Inventory Analysis protocol. Data visualizations, non-metric dimension scaling ordinations, and logistic regressions of the resulting data indicated that Pinyon Jay occupancy was concentrated in a distinct subset of available pinyon-juniper woodland habitat, and further that Pinyon Jays used different habitats, arrayed along elevational and tree-cover gradients, for seed caching, foraging, and nesting. Caching was concentrated in low-elevation, relatively flat areas with low tree cover; foraging occurred at slightly higher elevations with moderate tree cover, and nesting was concentrated in somewhat higher areas with greater tree cover and higher stand density. All three of these Pinyon Jay behavior types were highly concentrated within the lower-elevation band of pinyon-juniper woodland close to the woodland-shrubland ecotone. Because woodland removal projects in the Great Basin are often concentrated in these same areas, it is critical to incorporate conservation measures informed by Pinyon Jay occupancy patterns into existing woodland management paradigms, protocols, and practices.",

These molecular mechanisms have been heavily studied in humans, and although OA affects several other animals in addition to humans, few efforts have taken an evolutionary perspective. This study explores the evolution of OA epigenetics by assessing the relationship between DNA methylation variation and knee OA development in baboons (Papio spp.) and by comparing these findings to human OA epigenetic associations.\n\nMethodsGenome-wide DNA methylation patterns were identified in bone and cartilage of the right distal femora from 56 pedigreed, adult baboons (28 with and 28 without knee OA) using the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip.\n\nResultsSeveral significantly differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and regions (DMRs) were found between tissue types. Substantial OA-related differential methylation was also identified in cartilage, but not in bone, suggesting that cartilage epigenetics may be more influential in OA than bone epigenetics. Additionally, some genes containing OA-related DMPs overlap with and display methylation patterns similar to those previously identified in human OA, revealing a mixture of evolutionarily conserved and divergent OA-related methylation patterns in primates.\n\nConclusionsOverall, these findings reinforce current etiological perspectives of OA and enhance our evolutionary understanding of epigenetic mechanisms associated with OA. This work further establishes baboons as a valuable nonhuman primate model of OA, and continued investigations in baboons will help to disentangle the molecular mechanisms contributing to OA and their evolutionary histories.",

We find that the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) and vestibular nuclei (VN) are two major sources of inhibition to the IO that are specialized to provide inhibitory input with distinct kinetics. DCN to IO synapses lack fast synaptotagmin isoforms, release neurotransmitter asynchronously, and are exclusively GABAergic. VN to IO synapses contain fast synaptotagmin isoforms, release neurotransmitter synchronously, and are mediated by combined GABAergic and glycinergic transmission.

    "abstract": "The blink rate increases if a person indulges in a conversation compared to quiet rest. Since various factors were suggested to explain this increase, the present study tested the influence of motor activity, cognitive processes and auditory input on the blink rate but at the same time excluding any social interaction. While the cognitive and auditory factors only showed a minor influence, mere mouth movements during speaking highly increased the blink rate. Even more specific, lip movements, but less jaw movements, are likely responsible for the increase during a conversation. Such purely motor related influences on the blink rate advise caution when using blinks as neurological indicators during patient interviews.",

    "abstract": "Technological advances have allowed improvements in genome reference sequence assemblies. Here, we combined long- and short-read sequence resources to assemble the genome of a female Great Dane dog. This assembly has improved continuity compared to the existing Boxer-derived (CanFam3.1) reference genome. Annotation of the Great Dane assembly identified 22,182 protein-coding gene models and 7,049 long non-coding RNAs, including 49 protein-coding genes not present in the CanFam3.1 reference. The Great Dane assembly spans the majority of sequence gaps in the CanFam3.1 reference and illustrates that 2,151 gaps overlap the transcription start site of a predicted protein-coding gene. Moreover, a subset of the resolved gaps, which have an 80.95% median GC content, localize to transcription start sites and recombination hotspots more often than expected by chance, suggesting the stable canine recombinational landscape has shaped genome architecture. Alignment of the Great Dane and CanFam3.1 assemblies identified 16,834 deletions and 15,621 insertions, as well as 2,665 deletions and 3,493 insertions located on secondary contigs. These structural variants are dominated by retrotransposon insertion/deletion polymorphisms and include 16,221 dimorphic canine short interspersed elements (SINECs) and 1,121 dimorphic long interspersed element-1 sequences (LINE-1_Cfs). Analysis of sequences flanking the 3 end of LINE-1_Cfs (i.e., LINE-1_Cf 3-transductions) suggests multiple retrotransposition-competent LINE-1_Cfs segregate among dog populations. Consistent with this conclusion, we demonstrate that a canine LINE-1_Cf element with intact open reading frames can retrotranspose its own RNA and that of a SINEC_Cf consensus sequence in cultured human cells, implicating ongoing retrotransposon activity as a driver of canine genetic variation.\n\nSignificanceAdvancements in long-read DNA sequencing technologies provide more comprehensive views of genomes. We used long-read sequences to assemble a Great Dane dog genome that provides several improvements over the existing reference derived from a Boxer dog. Assembly comparisons revealed that gaps in the Boxer assembly often occur at the beginning of protein-coding genes and have a high-GC content, which likely reflects limitations of previous technologies in resolving GC-rich sequences. Dimorphic LINE-1 and SINEC retrotransposon sequences represent the predominant differences between the Great Dane and Boxer assemblies. Proof-of-principle experiments demonstrated that expression of a canine LINE-1 could promote the retrotransposition of itself and a SINEC_Cf consensus sequence in cultured human cells. Thus, ongoing retrotransposon activity may contribute to canine genetic diversity.",
