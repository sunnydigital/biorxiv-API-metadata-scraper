    "abstract": "In plants, genome stability is maintained during DNA replication by the H3.1K27 methyltransferases ATXR5 and ATXR6, which catalyze the deposition of K27me1 on replicationdependent H3.1 variants. Loss of H3.1K27me1 in atxr5 atxr6 double mutants leads to heterochromatin defects, including transcriptional de-repression and genomic instability, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified the conserved histone acetyltransferase GCN5 as a mediator of transcriptional de-repression and genomic instability in the absence of H3.1K27me1. GCN5 is part of a SAGA-like complex in plants that requires ADA2b and CHR6 to mediate the heterochromatic defects of atxr5 atxr6 mutants. Our results show that Arabidopsis GCN5 acetylates multiple lysine residues on H3.1 variants in vitro, but that H3.1K27 and H3.1K36 play key roles in inducing genomic instability in the absence of H3.1K27me1. Overall, this work reveals a key molecular role for H3.1K27me1 in maintaining genome stability by restricting histone acetylation in plants.",

    "abstract": "In a population, chemical communication determines the response of animals to changing environmental conditions, what leads to an enhanced resistance against stressors. In response to starvation, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans arrest post-embryonic development as L1 larva right after hatching. As arrested L1 larvae, C. elegans become more resistant to diverse stresses, allowing them to survive for several weeks expecting to encounter more favorable conditions. However, prolonged periods in L1 arrest lead to the accumulation of detrimental signs of aging, which ultimately provoke animal death. When arrested L1s feed, they undergo a recovery process to erase these harmful signs before resuming the developmental program. L1 arrested larvae secrete unidentified soluble compounds that improve survival to starvation. This protection is proportional to larval population density. Thus, animals arrested at high densities display an enhanced resistance to starvation. Here we show that this chemical communication also influences recovery after prolonged periods in L1 arrest. Animals at high density recovered faster than animals at low density. We found that the density effect on survival depends on the final effector of the insulin signaling pathway, the transcription factor DAF-16. Moreover, DAF-16 activation was higher at high density, consistent with a lower expression of the insulin-like peptide DAF-28 in the neurons. The improved recovery of animals after arrest at high density depended on soluble compounds present in the media of arrested L1s. In a try to find the nature of these compounds, we investigated the disaccharide trehalose as putative signaling molecule, since its production is enhanced during L1 arrest and it is able to activate DAF-16. We detected the presence of secreted trehalose in the medium of arrested L1 larvae at a low concentration. The addition of this concentration of trehalose to animals arrested at low density was enough to rescue DAF-28 production and DAF-16 activation to the levels of animals arrested at high density. However, despite activating DAF-16, trehalose was not capable of reversing survival and recovery phenotypes, suggesting the participation of additional signaling molecules. We finally identified GUR-3 as a possible trehalose receptor in C. elegans. With all, here we describe a molecular mechanism underlying social communication that allows C. elegans to maintain arrested L1 larvae ready to quickly recover as soon as they encounter nutrient sources.",

    "abstract": "Proper development of neuronal cells is important for brain functions, and impairment of neuronal development may lead to neuronal disorders, implying that improvement in neuronal development may be a therapeutic direction for these diseases. Huntingtons disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by impairment of neuronal structures, ultimately leading to neuronal death and dysfunctions of the central nervous system. Based on previous studies, fibroblast growth factor 9 (FGF9) may provide neuroprotective functions in HD, and FGFs may enhance neuronal development and neurite outgrowth. However, whether FGF9 can provide neuronal protective functions through improvement of neuronal morphology in HD is still unclear. Here, we study the effects of FGF9 on neuronal morphology in HD and attempt to understand the related working mechanisms. Taking advantage of striatal cell lines from HD knock-in mice, we found that FGF9 increases neurite outgrowth and upregulates several structural and synaptic proteins under HD conditions. In addition, activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) signaling by FGF9 was observed to be significant in HD cells, and blockage of NF-kB leads to suppression of these structural and synaptic proteins induced by FGF9, suggesting the involvement of NF-kB signaling in these effects of FGF9. Taken these results together, FGF9 may enhance neurite outgrowth through upregulation of NF-kB signaling, and this mechanism could serve as an important mechanism for neuroprotective functions of FGF9 in HD.",

    "abstract": "Despite significant research, the biological mechanisms underlying the brain degeneration in Myotonic Dystrophy Type I (DM1) remain largely unknown. Here we have assessed brain degeneration by measuring the volume loss (VL) and cognitive deficits (CD) in two cohorts of DM1 patients, and associating them to the large-scale brain transcriptome maps provided by the Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA). From a list of preselected hypothesis-driven genes, three of them appear to play a major role in degeneration: dystrophin (DMD), alpha-synuclein (SNCA) and the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). Moreover, a purely data-driven strategy identified gene clusters enriched for key biological processes in the central nervous system, such as synaptic vesicle recycling, localization, endocytosis and exocytosis, and the serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter pathways. Therefore, by combining large-scale transcriptome interactions with brain imaging and cognitive function, we provide a new more comprehensive understanding of DM1 that might help define future therapeutic strategies and research into this condition.",

    "abstract": "Brain injury after intracerebral hemorrhage is extremely complicated, and the exact mechanism remains puzzling. Piezo1, a novel mammalian mechanosensitive ion channel, has been identified to play important roles in several pathologic and physiologic procedures that involve cellular mechanotransduction. However, the role of Piezo1 in hematoma compression after intracerebral hemorrhage is still unclear. In the present study, we established a balloon-inflated rat brain model mimicking the pure mechanical compression of a hematoma and detected balloon compression in the basal ganglia region of the brain, resulting in abnormal behaviors and a significant increase in the expression of Piezo1 and proinflammatory cytokines. These effects were reversed by GsMTx4, an antagonist of Piezo1. Additionally, the balloon deflation time affected behavioral function and the levels of Piezo1 and proinflammatory cytokines. These results establish the first in vivo evidence for the role of Piezo1 in blood-brain neuroinflammation after hematoma compression. Piezo1 may therefore be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhage.",

    "abstract": "After a breakdown notified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, COVID-19 is declared as pandemic diseases. To the date more than 13 million confirmed cases and more than half a million are dead around the world. This virus also attached Malaysia in its immature stage where 8718 cases were confirmed and 122 were declared as death. Malaysia responsibly controlled the spread by enforcing MCO. Hence, it is required to visualize the pattern of Covid-19 spread. Also, it is necessary to estimate the impact of the enforced prevention measures. In this paper, an infectious disease dynamic modeling (SEIR) is used to estimate the epidemic spread in Malaysia. The main assumption is to update the reproduction number Rt with respect to the implemented prevention measures. For a time-frame of five month, the Rt was assumed to vary between 2.9 and 0.3. Moreover, the manuscript includes two possible scenarios: the first will be the extension of the stricter measures all over the country, and the second will be the gradual lift of the lock-down. After implementing several stages of lock-down we have found that the estimated values of the Rt with respect to the strictness degree varies between 0.2 to 1.1. A continuous strict lock-down may reduce the Rt to 0.2 and accordingly the estimated active cases will be reduced to 20 by the beginning of September 2020. In contrast, the second scenario considers a gradual lift of the enforced prevention measures by the end of June 2020, here we have considered three possible outcomes according to the MCO relaxation. Thus, the estimated values of Rt = 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, which shows a rapid increase in the number of active cases. The implemented SEIR model shows a close resemblance with the actual data recorded from 10, March till 7, July 2020.\n\nAuthor summaryConceptualization, A.A.A; methodology, A.A.A, N.M; validation, A.A.A, N.M; formal analysis, A.A.A; investigation, N.M, A.A.A; resources, G.E.M.A, L.T; data collection, L.T, N.M; writing--original draft preparation, A.A.A, L.T, G.E.M.A, N.M; writing--review and editing, V.S.A, S.C.D, B.S.G, P.S, S.A.B.M.Z, N.M; visualization, N.M; supervision, V.S.A; project administration, V.S.A.

The molecular features of retinal cells differed between the two species, suggesting the distinct regional and species specializations of the human and macaque retinae. In addition, human retinal aging occurred in a region- and cell-type- specific manner. Aging of human retina exhibited a foveal to peripheral gradient. MYO9A- rods and a horizontal cell subtype were greatly reduced in aging retina, indicating their vulnerability to aging. Moreover, we generated a dataset showing the cell-type- and region- specific gene expression associated with 55 types of human retinal disease, which provides a foundation to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human retinal diseases. Together, these datasets are valuable for understanding the molecular characteristics of primate retina, as well as the molecular regulation of aging progression and related diseases.",

Risk estimates for breast cancer were retrieved from publicly available GWA summary statistics from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) on 122,977 cases (of which 69,501 were estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, 21,468 ER-negative) and 105,974 controls of European ancestry.

Although Thailand has been effective at controlling the spread of COVID-19, disease surveillance and information on antibody responses in infected cases and close contacts are needed because there is still no specific treatment or vaccine available. We investigated 217 recovered COVID-19 cases to monitor their viral RNA shedding and production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The presence of antibodies in blood samples from 308 close contacts of COVID-19 cases was also determined. Viral RNA was still detectable in 6.6 % of recovered COVID-19 cases. The most prolonged duration of viral RNA shedding detected in this study was 105 days. IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 13.82, 88.48, and 83.41 % of the recovered cases 4-12 weeks after disease onset, respectively. Although the patients had recovered from their illness, the levels of antibodies detected showed association with their symptoms during their stay in hospital. Fifteen of the 308 contacts (4.87 %) of COVID-19 cases tested positive for IgG antibodies. The presence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 suggested that there was viral exposure among close contacts. Viral clearance and the pattern of antibody responses in infected individuals are both crucial for effectively combatting SARS-CoV-2. Our study provides additional information on the natural history of this newly emerging disease related to both natural host defenses and a strategy for vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Significant scientific and translational questions remain in auditory neuroscience surrounding the neural correlates of perception. Relating perceptual and neural data collected from humans can be useful; however, human-based neural data are typically limited to evoked far-field responses, which lack anatomical and physiological specificity. Laboratory-controlled preclinical animal models offer the advantage of comparing single-unit and evoked responses from the same animals. This ability provides opportunities to develop invaluable insight into proper interpretations of evoked responses, which benefits both basic-science studies of neural mechanisms and translational applications, e.g., diagnostic development. However, these comparisons have been limited by a disconnect between the types of spectrotemporal analyses used with single-unit spike trains and evoked responses, which results because these response types are fundamentally different (point-process versus continuous-valued signals) even though the responses themselves are related. Here, we describe a unifying framework to study temporal coding of complex sounds that allows spike-train and evoked-response data to be analyzed and compared using the same advanced signal-processing techniques. The framework uses alternating-polarity peristimulus-time histograms computed from single-unit spike trains to allow advanced spectral analyses of both slow (envelope) and rapid (temporal fine structure) response components. Demonstrated benefits include: (1) novel spectrally specific temporal-coding measures that are less corrupted by analysis distortions due to hair-cell transduction, synaptic rectification, and neural stochasticity compared to previous metrics, e.g., the correlogram peak-height, (2) spectrally specific analyses of spike-train modulation coding (magnitude and phase), which can be directly compared to modern perceptually based models of speech intelligibility (e.g., that depend on modulation filter banks), and (3) superior spectral resolution in analyzing the neural representation of nonstationary sounds, such as speech and music. This unifying framework significantly expands the potential of preclinical animal models to advance our understanding of the physiological correlates of perceptual deficits in real-world listening following sensorineural hearing loss.\n\nAuthor summaryDespite major technological and computational advances, we remain unable to match human auditory perception using machines, or to restore normal-hearing communication for those with sensorineural hearing loss. An overarching reason for these limitations is that the neural correlates of auditory perception, particularly for complex everyday sounds, remain largely unknown. Although neural responses can be measured in humans noninvasively and compared with perception, these evoked responses lack the anatomical and physiological specificity required to reveal underlying neural mechanisms. Single-unit spike-train responses can be measured from preclinical animal models with well-specified pathology; however, the disparate response types (point-process versus continuous-valued signals) have limited application of the same advanced signal-processing analyses to single-unit and evoked responses required for direct comparison. Here, we fill this gap with a unifying framework for analyzing both spike-train and evoked neural responses using advanced spectral analyses of both the slow and rapid response components that are known to be perceptually relevant for speech and music, particularly in challenging listening environments. Numerous benefits of this framework are demonstrated here, which support its potential to advance the translation of spike-train data from animal models to improve clinical diagnostics and technological development for real-world listening.",

    "abstract": "Echis carinatus (EC) is known as saw-scaled viper and it is endemic to the Indian subcontinent. Envenoming by EC represents a major cause of snakebite mortality and morbidity in the Indian subcontinent. Zinc (Zn++)-dependent snake venom metalloproteases (SVMPs) present in Echis carinatus venom is well known to cause systemic hemorrhage and coagulopathy in experimental animals. An earlier report has shown that ECV activates neutrophils and releases neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that blocks blood vessels leading to severe tissue necrosis. However, the direct involvement of SVMPs in the release of NETs is not clear. Here, we investigated the direct involvement of EC SVMPs in observed pathological symptoms in a preclinical setup using zinc (Zn++) metal chelator, Tetraethylthiuram disulfide (TTD)/disulfiram. TTD potently antagonizes the activity of SVMPs-mediated ECM protein degradation in vitro and skin hemorrhage in mice. In addition, TTD protected mice from ECV-induced footpad tissue necrosis by reduced expression of citrullinated H3 (citH3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in footpad tissue. TTD also neutralized ECV-induced systemic hemorrhage and conferred protection against lethality in mice. Moreover, TTD inhibited ECV-induced NETosis in human neutrophils and decreased the expression of peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) 4, citH3, MPO and pERK. Further, we demonstrated that ECV-induced NETosis and tissue necrosis is mediated via PAR-1-ERK axis. Overall, our results provide an insight into SVMPs-induced toxicities and the promising protective efficacy of TTD can be extrapolated to treat severe tissue necrosis complementing ASV.",

    "abstract": "CD8+ T cells play an important role in viral and tumour control. However, in human lymph nodes (LNs), only a small subset of CD8+ T cells called follicular CD8+ T cells (fCD8s) expresses CXCR5, the chemokine receptor required for cell migration into B cell follicles, thought to promote immune evasion. Here we obtained LNs from HIV infected persons to investigate regulation of CXCR5 expression in lymphoid CD8+ T cells, and compared this to the more abundant CXCR5 expressing T follicular CD4+ helper cells (GCTfh). Our results show that DNA hypermethylation and closed chromatin at the transcriptional start site (TSS) prevent CXCR5 expression in non-fCD8s. We also found that greater nucleosomal density at the CXCR5 TSS could be responsible for reduced CXCR5 expression in fCD8s relative to GCTfh. Together, these data provide critical insights into both the underlying molecular mechanisms that repress CXCR5 expression in non-fCD8s and the plausible mechanism responsible for the low CXCR5 expression in fCD8s, with implications for HIV cure strategies.\n\nAuthor SummaryA paucity of CD8+ T cells that express CXCR5, the chemokine receptor critical for entering the B cell follicles of secondary lymphoid tissues have recently been described. Animal studies have revealed transcriptional networks that govern the expression of CXCR5 in CD8+ T cells. However, it is not known if similar or additional networks regulate the expression of CXCR5 in human CD8+ T cells. In this study, we demonstrated that DNA methylation coupled with chromatin compaction at the transcriptional start site (TSS) of CXCR5 gene prevent the expression CXCR5 in human CD8+ T cells. In addition, we observed greater nucleosomal occupancy at the TSS of CXCR5 gene which could impact expression levels of CXCR5 in human CXCR5+CD8+ T cells. This study revealed multitiered epigenetic mechanisms that repress CXCR5 expression in human CD8+ T cells, with implications for HIV cure strategy or eradication of B cell-derived tumours.",

    "abstract": "The rise of pangenomic molecular assays allowed uncovering complex rearrangements named chromoanagenesis that were hypothesized to result from catastrophic shattering events. Constitutional cases have typically been reported individually preventing identification of common features and uncovering the mechanisms at play. We characterized 20 new chromoanagenesis and discovered yet undescribed features. While literature differentiates chromothripsis and its shattering event repaired through non-homologous end joining from chromoanasynthesis born to aberrant replicative processes, we identified shattered chromosomes repaired through a combination of mechanisms. In particular, three samples present with \"rearrangement hubs\" comprising a fragmented kilobase-long sequence threaded throughout the rearrangement.\n\nTo assess the mechanisms at play, we merged our data with those of 20 published constitutional complex chromosomal rearrangement cases. We evaluated if the distribution of their 1032 combined breakpoints was distinctive using bootstrap simulations and found that breakpoints tend to keep away from haplosensitive genes suggesting selective pressure. We then compared their distribution with that of 13,310 and 468 breakpoints of cancer complex chromosomal rearrangements and constitutional simple rearrangement samples, respectively. Both complex rearrangement groups showed breakpoint enrichment in late replicating regions suggesting similar origins for constitutional and cancer cases. Simple rearrangement breakpoints but not complex ones were depleted from lamina-associated domains (LADs), possibly as a consequence of reduced mobility of DNA ends bound to lamina.\n\nThe enrichment of breakpoints in late-replicating chromatin for both constitutional and cancer chromoanagenesis provides an orthogonal support to the premature chromosome condensation hypothesis that was put forward to explain chromoanagenesis.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer stem cells (BCSC) are highly resistant to current therapies, and are responsible for metastatic burden and relapse. Gamma delta T cells ({gamma}{delta}Tc) are immunosurveillance cells with tremendous anti-tumoral activity, and a growing number of clinical trials have confirmed the safety of {gamma}{delta}Tc immunotherapy for various malignancies. Herein, we demonstrate that {gamma}{delta}Tc can kill BCSC, but to a lesser extent than non-cancer stem cells (NSC). Immune evasion was orchestrated by several mechanisms. The BCSC secretome rendered {gamma}{delta}Tc hypo-responsive by reducing proliferation, cytotoxicity and IFN-{gamma} production, while increasing expression of co-inhibitory receptors on {gamma}{delta}Tc. BCSC and target cells surviving {gamma}{delta}Tc cytotoxicity had higher PD-L1 co-inhibitory ligand expression, and blocking PD-1 on {gamma}{delta}Tc significantly overcame BCSC resistance to {gamma}{delta}Tc killing. Fas/FasL signaling was dysfunctional in BCSC due to upregulation of the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1, which could be partially overcome using dMCL1-2, an MCL-1 degrader. Moreover, the BCSC fraction shed higher levels of the NKG2D ligand MICA compared to NSC. Inhibiting MICA shedding using the ADAM inhibitor GW280264X overcame BCSC resistance to {gamma}{delta}Tc killing, rendering BCSC as sensitive to {gamma}{delta}Tc cytotoxicity as NSC. Collectively, our data unravel multiple mechanisms exploited by BCSC to evade {gamma}{delta}Tc killing, which may also come into play in BCSC resistance to other cytotoxic lymphocytes. Developing strategies to overcome this resistance will increase the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy and lead to improved outcomes for cancer patients.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryBreast cancer stem-like cells are resistant to {gamma}{delta} T cell targeting, which can be overcome by inhibiting ADAM proteases that facilitate MICA/B shedding.",

It has been reported an association between parthenogenesis and Wolbachia infection in weevils from the tribe Naupactini. A curing experiment suggested that a threshold density of Wolbachia is required for parthenogenesis to occur. The aim of this study was to analyze Wolbachia infection status in the bisexual species Naupactus xanthographus and Naupactus dissimulator.\n\nWolbachia infection was detected in both species from some geographic locations, not being fixed. In all positive cases, faint PCR bands were observed. Quantification through real time PCR confirmed that Wolbachia loads in bisexual species were significantly lower than in parthenogenetic ones; this strengthens the hypothesis of a threshold level. Strain typing showed that both species carry wNau1, the most frequent in parthenogenetic Naupactini weevils. These infections seem to be recently acquired by horizontal transfer. Wolbachia was located throughout the whole body, which reinforce the idea of recent transmission. Moreover, we demonstrated that this strain carries the WO phage.\n\nFinally, the analysis of eubacterial 16S rRNA gene showed intense PCR bands for both bisexual species, suggesting -the presence of additional bacteria. Interspecific competition might explain why the parthenogenetic phenotype is not triggered.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionLeptospirosis is a neglected bacterial zoonotic infection caused by spirochetes of Leptospira genus. Humans get infected through direct or indirect contact with urine of infected animals or environment. It accounts for more than 300,000 severe cases annually worldwide with case fatality rates of over 30%. Costs of diagnosis and treatment for human and animals, disruption of international trade of animals and products, reduced productivity and reproductivity in animals constitute economic importance. In Kenya, leptospirosis burden is significant but under-diagnosis and under-reporting affects the awareness of the disease. This study aimed to determine and compare the sero-prevalence and factors associated with Leptospira spp. in the two counties.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional study that involved apparently healthy people of at least 5 years of age in randomly selected households in Garissa and Tana River Counties. Blood samples were collected and tested for Leptospira spp antibodies using IgM ELISA. Standardized structured questionnaires were administered to collect socio-demographic and exposure information. We calculated frequencies and proportions for categorical variables and odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to evaluate association between sero-positivity and exposure factors. We used Wilcoxon test to evaluate statistical difference in sero-positivity for continuous variables and calculated test statistic (H) and p-value.\n\nResultsA total of 952 subjects were recruited into the study - these included 482 persons from Garissa and 470 from Tana River. The overall sero-prevalence was 26% [(244/952); (CI: 23% to 29%)]. Garissa County had significantly higher Leptospira spp. seroprevalence (31%, n = 147; CI: 27% to 35%) compared to Tana River County (21 %, n = 97; CI: 17% to 25%). Being a female (OR=1.6, CI: 1.2-2.2) and engaging in pastoralism (OR=2.7, CI: 1.8-3.9) were significantly associated with higher odds of Leptospira spp. seropositivity compared to being a male or working in irrigated areas. The mean altitude of residence of sero-positive patients was 73m {+/-} 21 SD (standard deviation) above sea level and that for sero-negative was 80m {+/-} 22 SD (H=35, p-value = 0.00).\n\nConclusionThis study determined the seroprevalence and risk factors for Leptospira spp. exposure in Garissa and Tana River Counties, Kenya. Females in pastoral communities experience high burden of the disease. Enhanced surveillance in humans and animals and further research is required to understand the complex and multifactorial drivers of leptospirosis transmission in the two Counties.",

    "abstract": "Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of blindness globally, which develops through complex and poorly understood biological mechanisms. Herein, we conducted an integrated bioinformatics analysis of extant aqueous humor (AH) gene expression datasets in order to identify key genes and regulatory mechanisms governing POAG progression. We downloaded AH gene expression datasets (GSE101727 and GSE105269) corresponding to healthy controls and POAG patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus. We then identified mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that were differentially expressed (DE) between control and POAG patients. DEmRNAs and DElncRNAs were then subjected to pathway enrichment analyses, after which a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was generated. This network was then expanded to establish lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA and miRNA-transcription factor(TF)-mRNA networks. In total, the GSE101727 dataset was used to identify 2746 DElncRNAs and 2208 DEmRNAs, while the GSE105269 dataset was used to identify 45 DEmiRNAs. We ultimately constructed a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network incorporating 37, 5, and 14 of these lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs, respectively. The proteins encoded by these 14 hub mRNAs were found to be significantly enriched for activities that may be linked to POAG pathogenesis. In addition, we generated a miRNA-TF-mRNA regulatory network containing 2 miRNAs (miR-135a-5p and miR-139-5p), 5 TFs (TGIF2, TBX5, HNF1A, TCF3, and FOS) and 5 mRNAs (SHISA7, ST6GAC2, TXNIP, FOS, and DCBLD2).

    "abstract": "Several endocrine signals are known to mediate mosquito egg development including insulin-like peptide, 20-hydroxyecdysone, and juvenile hormone. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as an additional mediator of oogenesis in the mosquitoes, Aedes albopictus and Anopheles gambiae. The injection of aspirin (an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) shortly after blood-feeding significantly inhibited egg development at choriogenesis in a dose-dependent manner in Ae. albopictus. Moreover, oral administration of aspirin to An. albopictus and An. gambiae also inhibited egg production. The aspirin treatment suppressed expression of the genes (Yellow-g and Yellow-g2) associated with exochorion darkening and led to the production of a malformed egg shell in Ae. albopictus. These inhibitory effects of aspirin on egg development were rescued by the addition of PGE2, confirming the specificity of aspirin in inhibiting prostaglandin production. To validate these results, we identified a putative PGE2 receptor (Aa-PGE2R) in Ae. albopictus. Aa-PGE2R expression was highly inducible in adult ovary after blood-feeding. RNA interference of Aa-PGE2R expression resulted in the significant suppression of choriogenesis similar to aspirin treatment, where the addition of PGE2 to Aa-PGE2R-silenced females failed to rescue egg production. Together, these results suggest that PG synthesis and signaling are required for egg development across diverse mosquito taxa.\n\nAuthor SummaryProgstaglandins (PGs) play crucial roles in mediating various physiological processes in insects. Aspirin (ASP) inhibits PG biosynthesis and has been used as an anti-inflammatory drug. ASP injection or feeding to mosquitoes of Aedes albopictus or Anopheles gambiae significantly inhibits egg production at chorion formation. This led to significant reduction in fecundity and egg hatchability. PG signal is interrupted by RNA interference (RNAi) of PGE2 receptor. The RNAi treatment also gave a similar damage to females in egg production as seen in ASP treatment. Thus, PG signal is required for egg production of these mosquitoes.\n\nData Availability StatementAll relevant data are within the manuscript and its Supporting Information file.",

    "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are innate immune lymphocytes capable of killing target cells without prior sensitization. NK cell activity is regulated by signals received from activating and inhibitory receptors. One pivotal activating NK receptor is NKG2D, which binds a family of eight ligands, including the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related chain A (MICA). Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a ubiquitous betaherpesvirus causing morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients and congenitally infected infants. HCMV encodes multiple antagonists of NK cell activation, including many mechanisms targeting MICA. However, only one of these mechanisms counters the most prevalent MICA allele, MICA*008. Here, we discover that a hitherto uncharacterized HCMV protein, UL147A, specifically targets MICA*008 to proteasomal degradation, thus hindering the elimination of HCMV-infected cells by NK cells. Mechanistic analyses disclose that the non-canonical GPI anchoring pathway of immature MICA*008 constitutes the determinant of UL147A specificity for this MICA allele. These findings advance our understanding of the complex and rapidly evolving HCMV immune evasion mechanisms, which may facilitate the development of antiviral drugs and vaccines.\n\nAuthor SummaryHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common pathogen that usually causes asymptomatic infection in the immunocompetent population, but the immunosuppressed and fetuses infected in utero suffer mortality and disability due to HCMV disease. Current HCMV treatments are limited and no vaccine has been approved, despite significant efforts. HCMV encodes many genes of unknown function, and virus-host interactions are only partially understood. Here, we discovered that a hitherto uncharacterized HCMV protein, UL147A, downregulates the expression of an activating immune ligand allele named MICA*008, thus hindering the elimination of HCMV-infected cells. Elucidating HCMV immune evasion mechanisms could aid in the development of novel HCMV treatments and vaccines. Furthermore, MICA*008 is a highly prevalent allele implicated in cancer immune evasion, autoimmunity and graft rejection. In this work we have shown that UL147A interferes with MICA*008s poorly understood, nonstandard maturation pathway. Study of UL147A may enable manipulation of its expression as a therapeutic measure against HCMV.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic transmission is characterized by fast, tightly coupled processes and complex signaling path-ways that require a distinctly non-random spatial organization of their components. Nanoscale organization of synaptic proteins at glutamatergic synapses was suggested to regulate synaptic plasticity, the process underlying learning and memory. Specifically, direct colocalization of pre- and postsynaptic proteins implicated that the alignment of neurotransmitter release sites with neurotransmitter receptors enables maximal synaptic response. However, direct visualization and the mechanistic understanding of this alignment is lacking. Here we used cryo-electron tomography to visualize synaptic complexes in their native environment with the full complement of their interacting partners, synaptic vesicles and plasma membranes on 2-4 nanometer scale. The application of our recent template-free detection and classification procedure showed that tripartite trans-synaptic assemblies (subcolumns) link synaptic vesicles to postsynaptic receptors, and established that a particular displacement between directly interacting complexes characterizes subcolumns. Furthermore, we obtained de novo average structures of ionotropic glutamate receptors in their physiological composition, embedded in lipid membranes. The data presented support the hypothesis that synaptic function is carried by precisely organized trans-synaptic units. It complements superresolution findings and provides a framework for further exploration of synaptic and other large molecular assemblies that link different cells or cellular regions and may require weak or transient interactions to exert their function.",

    "abstract": "As working memory (WM) is limited in capacity, it is important to direct neural resources towards processing task-relevant information while ignoring distractors. Neural oscillations in the alpha frequency band (8-12 Hz) have been suggested to play a role in the inhibition of task-irrelevant information during WM, although results are mixed, possibly due to differences in the type of WM task employed. Here, we examined the role of alpha power in inhibition of anticipated distractors of varying strength using a modified Sternberg task where the encoding and retention periods were temporally separated. We recorded EEG while 20 young adults completed the task and found: 1) slower reaction times in strong distractor trials compared to weak distractor trials; 2) increased alpha power in posterior regions from baseline prior to presentation of a distractor regardless of condition; and 3) no differences in alpha power between strong and weak distractor conditions. Our results suggest that parieto-occipital alpha power is increased prior to a distractor. However we could not find evidence that alpha power is further modulated by distractor strength.",

    "abstract": "Although extensive behavioral changes often exist between closely related animal species, our understanding of the genetic basis underlying the evolution of behavior has remained limited. Here, we propose a new framework to study behavioral evolution by computational estimation of ancestral behavioral repertoires. We measured the behaviors of individuals from six species of fruit flies using unsupervised techniques and identified suites of stereotyped movements exhibited by each species. We then fit a Generalized Linear Mixed Model to estimate the suites of behaviors exhibited by ancestral species, as well as the intra- and inter-species behavioral covariances. We found that much of intraspecific behavioral variation is explained by differences between individuals in the status of their behavioral hidden states, what might be called their \"mood.\" Lastly, we propose a method to identify groups of behaviors that appear to have evolved together, illustrating how sets of behaviors, rather than individual behaviors, likely evolved. Our approach provides a new framework for identifying co-evolving behaviors and may provide new opportunities to study the genetic basis of behavioral evolution.",

    "abstract": "Resveratrol consumption has linked with normalization of the risk factors of some diseases such as colon cancer and type 2 diabetes. The antioxidant phenotype caused by resveratrol has recognized as a key piece in the health benefits exerted by this phytochemical. Although the antioxidant activity showed by resveratrol has attributed at the molecule per se, recent evidence indicates that the antioxidant effect occasioned by resveratrol could be associated with a pro-oxidant mechanism. The hypothesis that resveratrol inhibits complex III of the electron transport chain as its main target suggests that resveratrol increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation produces via reverse electron transport. This idea also explains that cells respond to the oxidative damage caused by resveratrol, inducing their antioxidant systems. The free radical theory of aging postulates that organisms age due to the accumulation of the harmful effects of ROS in cells. For these reasons, we hypothesize that resveratrol shortens the chronological life span (CLS) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae due to a pro-oxidant activity. Herein, we provide evidence that 100 M resveratrol supplementation at 5% glucose: 1) shorted the CLS of CTT1 and YAP1 genes deleted strains; 2) decreased the H2O2 release in the WT strain, and maintain unaltered the H2O2 release in the ctt1{Delta} strain; 3) lessened exponential growth of ctt1{Delta} strain, which was reverted with the adding of GSH; 4) increased catalase activity in the WT strain, a phenotype that was not observed in the ctt1{Delta} strain. Altogether, these results indicate that resveratrol decreases CLS by a pro-oxidant mechanism.",

We implemented two control schemes: position control with haptic feedback of ankle torque at the wrist; and torque control that allows the user to modify a baseline torque profile by moving their wrist against a virtual spring. We measured tracking error and frequency response for the ankle-foot prosthesis and the wrist exoskeleton. To demonstrate feasibility and evaluate system performance, we conducted an experiment in which one participant with a transtibial amputation tracked desired wrist trajectories during walking, while we measured wrist and ankle response.\n\nResultsBenchtop testing demonstrated that for relevant walking frequencies, system error was below human perceptual error. During the walking experiment, the participant was able to voluntarily follow different wrist trajectories with an average RMS error of 1.55{degrees} after training. The ankle was also able to track desired trajectories below human perceptual error for both position control (RMSE = 0.8{degrees}) and torque control (RMSE = 8.4%).\n\nConclusionWe present a system that allows a user with amputation to control an ankle-foot prosthesis and receive feedback about its state using a wrist exoskeleton, with accuracy comparable to biological neuromotor control.\n\nSignificanceThis bilateral teleoperation system enables novel prosthesis control and feedback strategies that could improve prosthesis control and aid motor learning.",

    "abstract": "Long-range synchrony from short-range interactions is a familiar pattern in biological and physical systems, many of which share a common set of \"universal\" properties at the point of synchronization. Common biological systems of coupled oscillators have been shown to be members of the Ising universality class, meaning that the very simple Ising model replicates certain spatial statistics of these systems at stationarity. This observation is useful because it reveals which aspects of spatial pattern arise independently of the details governing local dynamics, resulting in both deeper understanding of and a simpler baseline model for biological synchrony. However, in many situations a systems dynamics are of greater interest than their static spatial properties. Here, we ask whether a dynamical Ising model can replicate universal and non-universal features of ecological systems, using noisy coupled metapopulation models with two-cycle dynamics as a case study. The standard Ising model makes unrealistic dynamical predictions, but the Ising model with memory corrects this by using an additional parameter to reflect the tendency for local dynamics to maintain their phase of oscillation. By fitting the two parameters of the Ising model with memory to simulated ecological dynamics, we assess the correspondence between the Ising and ecological models in several of their features (location of the critical boundary in parameter space between synchronous and asynchronous dynamics, probability of local phase changes, and ability to predict future dynamics). We find that the Ising model with memory is reasonably good at representing these properties of ecological metapopulations. The correspondence between these models creates the potential for the simple and well-known Ising class of models to become a valuable tool for understanding complex biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Studying the evolutionary history of gene families is a challenging and exciting task with a wide range of implications. In addition to exploring fundamental questions about the origin and evolution of genes, disentangling their evolution is also critical to those who do functional/structural studies to allow a deeper and more precise interpretation of their results in an evolutionary context. The sirtuin gene family is a group of genes that are involved in a variety of biological functions mostly related to aging. Their duplicative history is an open question, as well as the definition of the repertoire of sirtuin genes among vertebrates. Our results show a well-resolved phylogeny that represents an improvement in our understanding of the duplicative history of the sirtuin gene family. We identified a new sirtuin gene family member (SIRT3.2) that was apparently lost in the last common ancestor of amniotes but retained in all other groups of jawed vertebrates. According to our experimental analyses, elephant shark SIRT3.2 protein is located in mitochondria, the overexpression of which leads to an increase in cellular levels of ATP. Moreover, in vitro analysis demonstrated it has deacetylase activity being modulated in a similar way to mammalian SIRT3. Our results indicate that there are at least eight sirtuin paralogs among vertebrates and that all of them can be traced back to the last common ancestor of the group that existed between 676 and 615 millions of years ago.",

    "abstract": "An animals choice behavior is shaped by the outcome feedback from selected actions in a trial-and-error approach. Tonically active neurons (TANs), presumed cholinergic interneurons in the striatum, are thought to be involved in the learning and performance of reward-directed behaviors, but it remains unclear how TANs are involved in shaping reward-directed choice behaviors based on the outcome feedback. To this end, we recorded activity of TANs from the dorsal striatum of two macaque monkeys (Macaca fuscata; 1 male, 1 female) while they performed a multi-step choice task to obtain multiple rewards. In this task, the monkeys first searched for a rewarding target from among three alternatives in a trial-and-error manner and then earned additional rewards by repeatedly choosing the rewarded target. We found that a considerable proportion of TANs selectively responded to either the reward or the no-reward outcome feedback during the trial-and-error search, but these feedback responses were not observed during repeat trials. Moreover, the feedback responses of TANs were similarly observed in any search trials, without distinctions regarding the predicted probability of rewards and the location of chosen targets. Unambiguously, TANs detected reward and no-reward feedback specifically when the monkeys performed trial-and-error searches, in which the monkeys were learning the value of the targets and adjusting their subsequent choice behavior based on the reward and no-reward feedback. These results suggest that striatal cholinergic interneurons signal outcome feedback specifically during search behavior, in circumstances where the choice outcomes cannot be predicted with certainty by the animals.\n\nHighlightsO_LITANs signal reward and no-reward outcome feedback when monkeys made search behaviors\nC_LIO_LITANs respond regardless of predicted reward probability or chosen target location\nC_LIO_LITANs may signal feedback outcomes when rewards cannot be predicted with certainty\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Advances in virtual reality (VR) technology have greatly benefited spatial navigation research. By presenting space in a controlled manner, changing aspects of the environment one at a time or manipulating the gain from different sensory inputs, the mechanisms underlying spatial behaviour can be investigated. In parallel, a growing body of evidence suggests that the processes involved in spatial navigation extend to non-spatial domains. Here, we leverage VR technology advances to test whether participants can navigate abstract knowledge. We designed a two-dimensional quantity space - presented using a head-mounted display - to test if participants can navigate abstract knowledge using a first-person perspective navigation paradigm. To investigate the effect of physical movement, we divided participants into two groups: one walking and rotating on a motion platform, the other group using a gamepad to move through the abstract space. We found that both groups learned to navigate using a first-person perspective and formed accurate representations of the abstract space. Interestingly, navigation in the quantity space resembled behavioural patterns observed in navigation studies using environments with natural visuospatial cues. Notably, both groups demonstrated similar patterns of learning. Taken together, these results imply that both self-movement and remote exploration can be used to learn the relational mapping between abstract stimuli.",

Only recently has it become appreciated that the timing of food intake, independent of total calorie consumption, is also critical. The involvement and contribution of the timing of food intake in nondipping blood pressure (BP), the most common disruption of the BP circadian rhythm in diabetes, however, remains uncertain. Here, we demonstrate that the loss of diurnal rhythm in food intake coincided with nondipping BP in type 2 diabetic db/db mice, and imposing a food intake diurnal rhythm by active time-restricted feeding (ATRF) remarkably prevented db/db mice from the development of nondipping BP. Moreover, ATRF, independent of calorie restriction, also effectively restored the already disrupted BP circadian rhythm in db/db mice. Mechanistically, ATRF reduced the sympathetic vascular tone and BP during the light phase via fasting, thus protecting the BP circadian rhythm in db/db mice. Moreover, we identified BMAL1, an obligatory core clock gene, as a potentially key molecule that links ATRF, sympathetic vascular tone, and BP circadian rhythm. Collectively, these data reveal an important but previously unrecognized role of the timing of food intake in the onset, prevention, and treatment of nondipping BP in diabetes.",

We show that specific small RNAs downregulate expression of multiple essential and AR-coregulatory genes, leading to potent androgen signaling inhibition and PCa cell death. Expression of different sh-/siRNAs designed to target TMEFF2, preferentially reduce viability of PCa, but not benign, cells and growth of murine xenografts. Surprisingly this effect is independent of TMEFF2 expression. Transcriptomic and sh/siRNA seed sequence studies indicate that expression of these toxic shRNAs lead to downregulation of AR-coregulatory and essential genes thru mRNA 3-UTR sequence complementarity to the seed sequence of the toxic shRNAs. These findings reveal a specialized form of the Death Induced by Survival gene Elimination (DISE) mechanism in PCa cells, that we have termed Androgen Network (AN)-DISE, and suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for PCa.",

    "abstract": "Here we demonstrate the Argo System, a massively parallel neural recording system based on platinum-iridium microwire electrode arrays bonded to a CMOS voltage amplifier array. The Argo system is the highest channel count in vivo neural recording system built to date, supporting simultaneous recording from 65,536 channels, sampled at over 32 kHz and 12-bit resolution. This system is designed for cortical recordings, compatible with both penetrating and surface microelectrodes. We have validated this system by recording spiking activity from 791 neurons in rats and cortical surface Local Field Potential (LFP) activity from over 30,000 channels in sheep. While currently adapted for head-fixed recording, the microwire-CMOS architecture is well suited for clinical translation. Thus, this demonstration helps pave the way for a future high data rate intracortical implant.",

    "abstract": "Effective processing of information from the environment requires the brain to selectively sample relevant inputs. The visual perceptual system has been shown to sample information rhythmically, oscillating rapidly between more and less input-favorable states. Evidence of parallel effects in auditory perception is inconclusive. Here, we combined a bilateral pitch-identification task with electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate whether the phase of ongoing EEG predicts auditory discrimination accuracy. We compared prestimulus phase distributions between correct and incorrect trials. Shortly before stimulus onset, each of these distributions showed significant phase concentration, but centered at different phase angles. The effects were strongest in theta and beta frequency bands. The divergence between phase distributions showed a linear relation with accuracy, accounting for at least 10% of inter-individual variance. Discrimination performance oscillated rhythmically at a rate predicted by the neural data. These findings indicate that auditory discrimination threshold oscillates over time along with the phase of ongoing EEG activity. Thus, it appears that auditory perception is discrete rather than continuous, with the phase of ongoing EEG oscillations shaping auditory perception by providing a temporal reference frame for information processing.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeG-protein biased -opioid agonists against {beta}-arrestin-2 activation are being investigated to reduce adverse effects. While opioid tolerance is strongly linked to the development of dependence, there is a dissociation between the two phenomena in the gut as tolerance does not develop to opioid-induced constipation, but diarrhea still manifests upon withdrawal. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which morphine tolerance in the small intestine develops.\n\nExperimental ApproachMechanism of morphine tolerance in the small intestine was evaluated in vivo and at the neuronal level. Whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology was used to investigate tolerance in individual ileum myenteric neurons. Rate of morphine tolerance development in the small intestine was assessed against peripheral antinociception and whole gut transit.\n\nKey ResultsTolerance develops to inhibition of small intestinal motility after one day of morphine exposure, and is more rapid compared to peripheral antinociception and constipation in chronic morphine-treated mice. Morphine tolerance was reversed by the PKC inhibitor, Tamoxifen, but not by {beta}-arrestin-2 deletion. Similarly, {beta}-arrestin-2 deletion did not prevent morphine tolerance to inhibition of neuronal excitability in ileum myenteric neurons. However, neuronal tolerance was attenuated by inhibiting PKC.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsUnlike antinociceptive tolerance, rapid morphine tolerance in the small intestine is independent of {beta}-arrestin-2 but is PKC-mediated. These findings reveal a potential mechanism for differences in the rates of tolerances to opioids, implicate myenteric neurons of the ileum as the primary cause for opioid-induced withdrawal effects and suggest that undesired gastrointestinal effects will persist with biased opioid agonist use.\n\nSummaryWhat is already known: O_LITolerance does not develop to chronic-opioid-induced constipation but diarrhea is produced upon withdrawal\nC_LIO_LINovel G-protein biased agonists that preclude {beta}-arrestin-2 activation at the -opioid receptor are in development\nC_LI\n\nWhat this study adds: O_LIMorphine tolerance in the ileum develops systemically and in individual myenteric neurons independent of {beta}-arrestin-2\nC_LIO_LIMorphine tolerance in the small intestine develops before antinociception and is reversed by PKC inhibition\nC_LI\n\nClinical significance: O_LIClinical use of G-protein biased opioid agonists will not prevent tolerance development in the ileum\nC_LIO_LITolerance in ileum myenteric neurons might be the basis of opioid-induced withdrawal in the gut\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Pyrimidine nucleotides are essential to plant development. We proved that Arabidopsis growth can be inhibited or enhanced by down- or upregulating aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATC), the first committed enzyme for de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines in plants. To understand the unique mechanism of feedback inhibition of this enzyme by uridine 5-monophosphate (UMP), we determined the crystal structure of the Arabidopsis ATC trimer free and bound to UMP, demonstrating that the nucleotide binds and blocks the active site. The regulatory mechanism relies on a loop exclusively conserved in plants, and a single-point mutation (F161A) turns ATC insensitive to UMP. Moreover, the structures in complex with a transition-state analog or with carbamoyl phosphate proved a mechanism in plant ATCs for sequential firing of the active sites. The disclosure of the unique regulatory and catalytic properties suggests new strategies to modulate ATC activity and to control de novo pyrimidine synthesis and plant growth.",
