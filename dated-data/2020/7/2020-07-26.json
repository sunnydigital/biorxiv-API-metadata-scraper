    "abstract": "We are not individuals, we are much better described as ecosystems due to trillions of bacteria and other microorganisms that inhabit us. We now know that gut microbiota can greatly influence many physiological parameters that in turn may impact several cognitive functions, such as learning, memory, and decision making processes. This mutualistic symbiotic relation known as the gut-brain axis is also constrained by external factors such as dietary habits such as animal protein and lipids intake. Using a novel combination of Machine Learning and Network Theory techniques, we provide evidence from an indigenous population in Guerrero Mexico, that both brain and gut-microbiota connectivity, evaluated by Minimum Spanning Tree as the critical backbone of information flow, diminish under either low protein or lipids intake. We discuss then how this loss of connectivity may translate into a reduction of the individuals capacity to cope with perturbations as loss of connectivity may be linked with losses in antifragility.",

    "abstract": "O_LIMicroplastics in soils have become an important threat for terrestrial systems, which can be exacerbated by drought as microplastics may affect soil water content. Thus, the interaction between these two factors may alter ecosystem functions such as litter decomposition, stability of soil aggregates, as well as functions related to nutrient cycling. Despite this potential interaction, we know relatively little about how microplastics, under different soil water conditions, affect ecosystem functions and ecosystem multifunctionality.\nC_LIO_LITo address this gap, we carried out a controlled-environment study using grassland plant communities. We applied the two factors microplastic fibers (absent, present) and soil water conditions (well-watered, drought), in all possible combinations in a factorial experiment. At harvest, we measured multiple ecosystem functions linked to nutrient cycling, litter decomposition, and soil aggregation and as terrestrial systems provide these functions simultaneously, we also assessed ecosystem multifunctionality.\nC_LIO_LIOur results showed that the interaction between microplastic fibers and drought affected ecosystem functions and multifunctionality. Overall, drought had negatively affected nutrient cycling by decreasing potential enzymatic activities and increasing nutrient leaching, while microplastic fibers had a positive impact on soil aggregation and nutrient retention by diminishing nutrient leaching. Microplastic fibers also impacted enzymatic activities, soil respiration and ecosystem multifunctionality, but importantly, the direction of these effects depended on soil water status (i.e., they decreased under well watered conditions, but tended to increase or had similar effects under drought conditions). Litter decomposition had a contrary pattern.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis and applications. As soil water content is affected by climate change, our results suggest that areas with sufficiency of water would be negatively affected in their ecosystem functioning as microplastics increase in the soil; however, in areas subjected to drought, microplastics would have a neutral or slightly positive effect on ecosystem functioning.\nC_LI",

They arise from steroidogenic progenitors, whose origins, maintenance and differentiation dynamics remain largely unknown. Here, we identified Wnt5a as a specific marker of steroidogenic progenitors, whose expression begins at around E11.5-E12.5 in interstitial cells of the fetal mouse testis. In vivo lineage tracing indicates that Wnt5a-expressing progenitors are initially present in large numbers in the fetal testis and then progressively decrease as development progresses. We provide evidence that Wnt5a-expressing cells are bona fide progenitors of peritubular myoid cells as well as fetal and adult LCs, contributing to most of the LCs present in the fetal and adult testis. Additionally, we show in the adult testis that Wnt5a expression is restricted to a subset of LCs exhibiting a slow but noticeable clonal expansion, revealing hitherto unappreciated proliferation of fully differentiated LCs as a contribution to the adult LC pool.",

    "abstract": "C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is involved in several intractable disease processes, including HIV infection, cancer cell metastasis, leukemia cell progression, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, CXCR4 represents a promising drug target and several CXCR4 antagonizing agents are in preclinical or clinical development. Important parameters in drug lead evaluation are determination of binding affinities to the receptor and assessment of their stability and activity in plasma or blood of animals and humans. Here, we designed a microtiter plate-based CXCR4 antibody competition assay that enables to measure inhibitory concentrations (IC50 values) and affinity constants (Ki values) of CXCR4 targeting drugs. The assay is based on the observation that most if not all CXCR4 antagonists compete with binding of the fluorescence-tagged CXCR4 antibody 12G5 to the receptor. We demonstrate that this antibody-competition assay allows a convenient and cheap determination of binding affinities of various CXCR4 antagonists in living cells within just 3 hours. Moreover, the assay can be performed in the presence of high concentrations of physiologically relevant body fluids, and thus is a useful readout to evaluate stability (i.e. half-life) of CXCR4 ligands in serum/plasma, and even whole human and mouse blood ex vivo. Thus, this optimized 12G5 antibody competition assay allows a robust and convenient determination and calculation of various important pharmacological parameters of CXCR4 receptor-drug interaction and may not only foster future drug development but also animal welfare by reducing the number of experimental animals.",

Based on asymmetric features of cryo-EM structures and a sequential hand-over-hand model of substrate translocation, recent publications have proposed that the AAA+ unfoldases ClpA and ClpX must rotate with respect to their partner peptidase ClpP to allow function. Here, we test this model by covalently crosslinking ClpA to ClpP to prevent rotation. We find that crosslinked ClpAP omplexes unfold, translocate, and degrade protein substrates, albeit modestly slower han uncrosslinked enzyme controls. Rotation of ClpA with respect to ClpP therefore is ot required for ClpAP protease activity, although some flexibility in how the AAA+ ring ocks on ClpP may be necessary for optimal function.",

    "abstract": "Animal cytokinesis ends with the formation of a thin intercellular membrane bridge connecting the two newly formed sibling cells that is ultimately resolved by abscission. While mitosis is completed within 15 minutes, the intercellular bridge can persist for hours, maintaining a physical connection between sibling cells and allowing exchange of cytosolic components. Although cell-cell communication is fundamental for development, the potential role of intercellular bridges during embryogenesis have not been fully elucidated. Here, we found that in early zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryogenesis, abscission is delayed and cells do not resolve their intercellular bridges until midblastula transition (MBT), giving rise to the formation of small inter-connected cell clusters. Interestingly, abscission commences during the MBT switch, which is manifested by cell cycle elongation, loss of synchronized divisions and genome activation. Moreover, depletion of Chmp4bb which is an essential ESCRT-III component for scission, delayed abscission beyond the MBT switch. Hallmark features of MBT, including transcription onset and cell shape changes, were similar in sibling cells connected by intercellular bridges, proposing a role for intercellular bridges in maintaining cell-cell communication in the embryo. Taken together, our data suggest that abscission is part of the cellular changes that occur during MBT and that cells coordinate their behavior during this critical embryonic phase through persisted intercellular bridges.\n\nSignificance StatementIn this work we show that the last step of cytokinesis, termed abscission, is inhibited in early zebrafish embryos. As a result, sibling cells remain connected to one another for several cycles and mutually time their developmental progress including transcription onset. Abscission commences at the 10th cell cycle, when embryos enter the midblastula transition (MBT) switch in which embryonic cells become individualized and exhibit the characteristics of mature cells. Our data suggest that abscission is part of the MBT switch and that embryonic sibling cells mutually time their developmental progress by maintaining physical connections between them in the early embryo.",

    "abstract": "Originality-significance statementMotility and biofilm formation are processes regulated by quorum sensing (QS) in bacteria. Both functions are believed to play an important role in interactions between bacteria and phytoplankton. Here, we show that two bacterial symbionts from the microbial community associated with a ubiquitous diatom switch their motile lifestyle to attached cells while an opportunist bacterium from the same community is incapable of attachment, despite possessing the genetic machinery to do so. Further work indicated that the opportunist lacks QS signal synthases while the symbionts produce three QS signals, one of which is mainly responsible for regulating symbiont colonization of the diatom microenvironment. These findings suggest that QS regulates colonization of diatom surfaces and further work on these model systems will inform our understanding of particle aggregation and bacterial attachment to marine snow and how these processes influence the global carbon cycle.\n\nSummaryInteractions between phytoplankton and bacteria play major roles in global biogeochemical cycles and oceanic nutrient fluxes. These interactions occur in the microenvironment surrounding phytoplankton cells, known as the phycosphere. Bacteria in the phycosphere use either chemotaxis or attachment to benefit from algal excretions. Both processes are regulated by quorum sensing (QS), a cell-cell signaling mechanism that uses small infochemicals to coordinate bacterial gene expression. However, the role of QS in regulating bacterial attachment in the phycosphere is not clear. Here, we isolated a Sulfitobacter pseudonitzschiae F5 and a Phaeobacter sp. F10 belonging to the marine Roseobacter group and an Alteromonas macleodii F12 belonging to Alteromonadaceae, from the microbial community of the ubiquitous diatom Asterionellopsis glacialis. We show that only the Roseobacter group isolates (diatom symbionts) can attach to diatom transparent exopolymeric particles. Despite all three bacteria possessing genes involved in motility, chemotaxis, and attachment, only S. pseudonitzschiae F5 and Phaeobacter sp. F10 possessed complete QS systems and could synthesize QS signals. Using UHPLC-MS/MS, we identified three QS molecules produced by both bacteria of which only 3-oxo-C16:1-HSL strongly inhibited bacterial motility and stimulated attachment in the phycosphere. These findings suggest that QS signals enable colonization of the phycosphere by algal symbionts.",

    "abstract": "Past work has demonstrated that active suppression of salient distractors is a critical part of visual selection. Evidence for goal-driven suppression includes below-baseline visual encoding at the position of salient distractors (Gaspelin and Luck, 2015) and neural signals such as the Pd that track the position and number of distractors in the visual field (Feldmann-Wustefeld and Vogel, 2019). One basic question regarding distractor suppression is whether it is inherently spatial or nonspatial in character. Indeed, past work has shown that distractors evoke both spatial (Theeuwes, 1992) and nonspatial forms of interference (Folk and Remington, 1998), motivating a direct examination of whether space is integral to goal-driven distractor suppression. Here, we provide clear evidence for a spatial gradient of suppression surrounding salient singleton distractors. Replicating past work, both reaction time and neural indices of target selection improved monotonically as the distance between target and distractor increased. Importantly, these target selection effects were paralleled by a monotonic decline in the amplitude of the Pd, an electrophysiological index of distractor suppression. Moreover, multivariate analyses revealed spatially selective activity in the theta band that tracked the position of the target and - critically - revealed suppressed activity at spatial channels centered on distractor positions. Thus, goal-driven selection of relevant over irrelevant information benefits from a spatial gradient of suppression surrounding salient distractors.",

    "abstract": "We live in an increasingly data-driven world, where high-throughput sequencing and mass spectrometry platforms are transforming biology into an information science. This has shifted major challenges in biological research from data generation and processing to interpretation and knowledge translation. However, post-secondary training in bioinformatics, or more generally data science for life scientists, lags behind current demand. In particular, development of accessible, undergraduate data science curricula has potential to improve research and learning outcomes and better prepare students in the life sciences to thrive in public and private sector careers. Here, we describe the Experiential Data science for Undergraduate Cross-Disciplinary Education (EDUCE) initiative, which aims to progressively build data science competency across several years of integrated practice. Through EDUCE, students complete data science modules integrated into required and elective courses augmented with coordinated co-curricular activities. The EDUCE initiative draws on a community of practice consisting of teaching assistants, postdocs, instructors and research faculty from multiple disciplines to overcome several reported barriers to data science for life scientists, including instructor capacity, student prior knowledge, and relevance to discipline-specific problems. Preliminary survey results indicate that even a single module improves student self-reported interest and/or experience in bioinformatics and computer science. Thus, EDUCE provides a flexible and extensible active learning framework for integration of data science curriculum into undergraduate courses and programs across the life sciences.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe EDUCE teaching and learning framework is accessible at educe-ubc.github.io",

We used these proMPs to program specific oligomeric interactions into a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) and found that both in vitro CAR T cell cytokine release and in vivo antitumor activity scaled linearly with the oligomeric state encoded by the receptor TMD, from monomers up to tetramers. All programmed CARs (proCARs) stimulated substantially lower T cell cytokine release relative to the commonly used CD28 TMD, which we show elevated cytokine release through lateral recruitment of the endogenous T cell costimulatory receptor CD28.

Specifically, we report the impact of dynamic control over two enzymes: citrate synthase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, on stationary phase fluxes. Firstly, reduced citrate synthase levels lead to a reduction in -ketoglutarate, which is an inhibitor of sugar transport, resulting in increased stationary phase glucose uptake and glycolytic fluxes. Reduced glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity activates the SoxRS regulon and expression of pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase, which is in turn responsible for large increases in acetyl-CoA production. The combined reduction in citrate synthase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, leads to greatly enhanced stationary phase metabolism and the improved production of citramalic acid enabling titers of 126{+/-}7g/L.

    "abstract": "Mucus is a fluid that protects animals against pathogens while promoting interactions with commensal microbes. Changes in the diffusivity of particles in mucus alter viruses infectivity, the efficiency of bacterial pathogens to invade a host, and the effectivity of drug delivery. Multiple physicochemical properties modulate the diffusion of microscopic particles in mucus, but their combined effect is unclear. Here, we analyzed the impact of particle size, charge, chemistry, anomalous diffusion exponent, and mucus composition in the diffusivity of particles from 106 published experiments. We used a time window sampling of one second to define a consistent, effective diffusion across experiments. The effective diffusion spanned seven orders of magnitude from 10-5 to 102 {micro}m2/s. The anomalous exponent was the strongest predictor among all variables tested. It displayed an exponential relationship with the effective diffusion that explained 90% of the empirical data variance. We showed that the relationship and dominance of the anomalous diffusion exponent resulted from a general mathematical relationship obtained from first-principles for any subdiffusion mechanism. Our derivation demonstrated that the generalized diffusion coefficient is not a measurable physical quantity and must be replaced by the length and time scales associated with the underlying mobility mechanisms. This led us to a fundamental reformulation of the classic subdiffusion equation, which calls for a reinterpretation of anomalous diffusion in physical systems. We also discussed how our results impact the characterization of microscopic particle diffusion in mucus and other hydrogels.",

    "abstract": "The coefficient of determination R2 quantifies the amount of variance explained by regression coefficients in a linear model. It can be seen as the fixed-effects complement to the repeatability R (intra-class correlation) for the variance explained by random effects and thus as a tool for variance decomposition. The R2 of a model can be further partitioned into the variance explained by a particular predictor or a combination of predictors using semi-partial (part) R2 and structure coefficients, but this is rarely done due to a lack of software implementing these statistics. Here, we introduce partR2, an R package that quantifies part R2 for fixed effect predictors based on (generalized) linear mixed-effect model fits. The package iteratively removes predictors of interest from the model and monitors the change in the variance of the linear predictor. The difference to the full model gives a measure of the amount of variance explained uniquely by a particular predictor or a set of predictors. partR2 also estimates structure coefficients as the correlation between a predictor and fitted values, which provide an estimate of the total contribution of a fixed effect to the overall prediction, independent of other predictors. Structure coefficients can be converted to the total variance explained by a predictor, here called  inclusive R2, as the square of the structure coefficients times total R2. Furthermore, the package reports beta weights (standardized regression coefficients). Finally,partR2 implements parametric bootstrapping to quantify confidence intervals for each estimate. We illustrate the use of partR2 with real example datasets for Gaussian and binomial GLMMs and discuss interactions, which pose a specific challenge for partitioning the explained variance among predictors.",

    "abstract": "Invasive Phragmites australis (European Common Reed) is rapidly spreading throughout North American wetlands, with negative impacts on wildlife and native plants. The removal or suppression of P. australis is desired to provide an opportunity for native vegetation and wetland fauna to recover. In Ontario, managers applied a glyphosate-based herbicide to >400 ha of P. australis in ecologically significant Great Lakes coastal marshes, representing the first time this tool was used over standing water to suppress P. australis in Canada. Using a replicated Before-After-Control-Impact monitoring design, we 1) evaluated the efficacy of glyphosate-based herbicide at suppression P. australis along a water depth gradient and 2) assessed the recovery of the vegetation community for two years after treatment in relation to local reference conditions. We found that herbicide reduced live P. australis stem densities by over 99% the first year after treatment and about 95% the second year post-treatment. Treatment was equally effective along the entire water depth gradient (10 - 48 cm). The initial  suppression focused management was successful, but sustained monitoring and  containment focused follow-up treatment will be required to prevent reinvasion. Two years after treatment, the vegetation community does not resemble reference conditions. Although some treated plots initially increased in similarity to the vegetation communities typical of reference areas, many plots where P. australis was suppressed are on a novel trajectory comprising a vegetation community dominated by non-native Hydrocharis morsus-ranae. Secondary invasions represent a major challenge to effective recovery of native vegetation after P. australis control.",

    "abstract": "Granulins (GRN 1-7) are short ([~]6 kDa), cysteine-rich proteins that are generated upon the proteolytic processing of progranulin (PGRN). These modules, along with their precursor, have been implicated in multiple pathophysiological roles, especially in neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous investigations into GRN-3 and GRN-5 reveal them to be fully disordered in the reduced form and implicate redox sensitive attributes to the proteins. Such redox-dependent modulation has become associated with proteins involved in oxidative stress regulation and maintaining metal-homeostasis within cells. To probe whether GRNs play a contributory role in such functions, we tested the metal binding potential of the reduced form of GRNs -3 and -5 under neutral and acidic pH mimicking cytosolic and lysosomal conditions, respectively. We found, at neutral pH, both GRNs selectively bind Cu(II) and no other divalent cations. Binding of Cu(II) also partly triggered the oxidative multimerization of GRNs via uncoordinated cystines at both pH conditions. Furthermore, binding did not induce gain in secondary structure and the protein remained disordered. Overall, the results indicate that GRN-3 and -5 have a surprisingly strong affinity for Cu(II) in the pM range, comparable to known copper sequestering proteins. This data also hints at a potential of GRNs to reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I), a process that has significance in mitigating Cu-induced ROS cytotoxicity in cells. Together, this report uncovers a metal-coordinating capability of GRNs for the first time, which could have profound significance in their structure and function.",

    "abstract": "The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is known to enable viral invasion into human cells through direct binding to host receptors including ACE2. An alternate entry receptor for the virus was recently proposed to be basigin/CD147. These early studies have already prompted a clinical trial and multiple published hypotheses of the role of this host receptor in viral infection and pathogenesis. We sought to independently characterize the basigin-spike protein interaction. After conducting several lines of experiments, we report that we are unable to find evidence supporting the role of basigin as a putative spike-binding receptor. Recombinant forms of both the entire ectodomain and S1 domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that directly bind ACE2 do not interact with basigin expressed on the surface of human cells. Using specialized assays tailored to detect receptor interactions as weak or weaker than the proposed basigin-spike binding, we report no evidence for direct binding of the viral spike to either of the two common isoforms of basigin. Given the pressing need for clarity on which targets of SARS-CoV-2 may lead to promising therapeutics, we present these findings to allow more informed decisions about the translational relevance of this putative mechanism in the race to understand and treat COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic underwent a rapid transition with the emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant that carried the amino acid substitution D614G in the Spike protein that became globally prevalent. The G-form is both more infectious in vitro and associated with increased viral loads in infected people. To gain insight into the mechanism underlying these distinctive characteristics, we employed multiple replicas of microsecond all-atom simulations to probe the molecular-level impact of this substitution on Spikes closed and open states. The open state enables Spike interactions with its human cellular receptor, ACE2. Here we show that changes in the inter-protomer energetics due to the D614G substitution favor a higher population of infection-capable (open) states. The inter-protomer interactions between S1 and S2 subunits in the open state of the D-form are asymmetric. This asymmetry is resolved in the G-form due to the release of tensile hydrogen bonds resulting in an increased population of open conformations. Thus, the increased infectivity of the G-form is likely due to a higher rate of profitable binding encounters with the host receptor. It is also predicted to be more neutralization sensitive due to enhanced exposure of the receptor binding domain, a key target region for neutralizing antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Due to the lack of protective immunity of humans towards the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2, this virus has caused a massive pandemic across the world resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. Thus, a vaccine is urgently needed to contain the spread of the virus. Here, we describe Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vector vaccines expressing the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in its wild type or a pre-fusion membrane anchored format. All described NDV vector vaccines grow to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs. In a proof of principle mouse study, we report that the NDV vector vaccines elicit high levels of antibodies that are neutralizing when the vaccine is given intramuscularly. Importantly, these COVID-19 vaccine candidates protect mice from a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 challenge with no detectable viral titer and viral antigen in the lungs.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSThe spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 is the major antigen that notably induces neutralizing antibodies to block viral entry. Many COVID-19 vaccines are under development, among them viral vectors expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 exhibit many benefits. Viral vector vaccines have the potential of being used as both live or inactivated vaccines and they can induce Th1 and Th2-based immune responses following different immunization regimens. Additionally, viral vector vaccines can be handled under BSL-2 conditions and they grow to high titers in cell cultures or other species restricted-hosts. For a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, several viral vectors are being tested, such as adenovirus, measles virus and Modified vaccinia Ankara.\n\nAdded value of this studyThe NDV vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 described in this study has advantages similar to those of other viral vector vaccines. But the NDV vector can be amplified in embryonated chicken eggs, which allows for high yields and low costs per dose. Also, the NDV vector is not a human pathogen, therefore the delivery of the foreign antigen would not be compromised by any pre-existing immunity in humans. Finally, NDV has a very good safety record in humans, as it has been used in many oncolytic virus trials. This study provides an important option for a cost-effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceThis study informs of the value of a viral vector vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, for this NDV based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, the existing egg-based influenza virus vaccine manufactures in the U.S. and worldwide would have the capacity to rapidly produce hundreds of millions of doses to mitigate the consequences of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe recently delineated the functional biology of pathogenic and inflammation resolving synovial tissue macrophage clusters in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Whilst RA is not a viral respiratory syndrome, it represents a pro-inflammatory cytokine-driven chronic articular condition often accompanied by cardiovascular and lung pathologies. We hypothesised that functionally equivalent macrophage clusters in the lung might govern inflammation and resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis.\n\nMethodsTo provide insight into the targetable functions of COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage (BALF) macrophage clusters, a comparative analysis of BALF macrophage single cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq) with synovial tissue (ST) macrophage scRNA-seq and functional biology was performed. The function of shared BALF and ST MerTK inflammation-resolving pathway was confirmed with inhibitor in primary macrophage-synovial fibroblast co-cultures. Results. Distinct BALF FCNpos and FCNposSPP1pos macrophage clusters emerging in severe COVID-19 patients were closely related to ST CD48highS100A12pos and CD48posSPP1pos clusters driving synovitis in active RA. They shared transcriptomic profile and pathogenic mechanisms. Healthy lung resident alveolar FABP4pos macrophages shared a regulatory transcriptomic profile, including TAM (Tyro, Axl, MerTK) receptors pathway with synovial tissue TREM2pos macrophages that govern RA remission. This pathway was substantially altered in BALF macrophages of severe COVID-19. In vitro dexamethasone inhibited tissue inflammation via macrophages MerTK function.\n\nConclusionPathogenesis and resolution of COVID-19 pneumonitis and RA synovitis might be driven by similar macrophage clusters and pathways. The MerTK-dependent anti-inflammatory mechanisms of dexamethasone, and the homeostatic function of TAM pathways that maintain RA in remission advocate the therapeutic MerTK agonism to ameliorate the cytokine storm and pneumonitis of severe COVID-19.",

Cellular and cell-free expression assays, we show a direct interaction between BRCA1 and cavin3. Association of BRCA1 and cavin3 occurs when cavin3 is released from caveolae that are disassembled in response to UV and mechanical stress. Supporting a role in DNA repair, cavin3-deficient cells were sensitized to the effects of PARP inhibition, which compromises DNA repair, and showed reduced recruitment of the BRCA1 A-complex to UV DNA damage foci. Overexpression and RNAi-depletion revealed that cavin3 sensitized various cancer cells to UV-induced apoptosis. We conclude that cavin3 functions together with BRCA1 in multiple pathways that contribute to tumorigenesis.",

To test for latent potential for dentition that would facilitate its evolutionary expansion, we overexpressed a tooth initiation signal, the tumor necrosis factor pathway ligand ectodysplasin, in a model characiform, the Mexican Tetra (Astyanax mexicanus). This manipulation resulted in extensive ectopic dentition, in contrast to its previously-reported limited effect in the Zebrafish (Danio rerio). Tooth location in the Order Cypriniformes, to which the Zebrafish belongs, is much more restricted than in characiforms, a pattern that may be explained by differences in the retention of ancestral developmental potential.

However, the role of the different subtypes of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is complex and not clearly understood. Therefore, we measured NMDA receptors subunits expression in limbic brain areas. In addition, we studied the effects of VTA down-regulation of GluN2C NMDA receptor on the reward signal that arises from DR electrical stimulation.\n\nMethodsUsing qPCR, we identified the relative composition of the different Grin2a-d subunits of the NMDA receptors in several brain areas. Then, we used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to evaluate the colocalization of Grin2c and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA in VTA neurons. To assess the role of GluN2C in brain stimulation reward; we downregulated this receptor using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in rats self-stimulating for electrical pulses delivered to the DR. To delineate further the specific role of GluN2C in relaying the reward signal, we pharmacologically altered the function of VTA NMDA receptors by bilaterally microinjecting the NMDA receptor antagonist PPPA.\n\nResultsWe identified GluN2C as the most abundant subunit of the NMDA receptor expressed in the VTA.

We encoded the complete kinetics of infection for coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), a compact and fast-acting RNA virus. The kinetics are built from detailed modules for viral binding-delivery, translation-replication, and encapsidation. Specific module activities are dampened by the type I interferon response to viral double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), which is itself disrupted by viral proteinases. The validated kinetics uncovered that cleavability of the dsRNA transducer mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) becomes a stronger determinant of viral outcomes when cells receive supplemental interferon after infection. Cleavability is naturally altered in humans by a common MAVS polymorphism, which removes a proteinase-targeted site but paradoxically elevates CVB3 infectivity. These observations are reconciled with a simple nonlinear model of MAVS regulation. Modeling complete kinetics is an attainable goal for small, rapidly infecting viruses and perhaps viral pathogens more broadly.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular elastic filaments such as microtubules are subject to thermal Brownian noise and active noise generated by molecular motors that convert chemical energy into mechanical work. Similarly, polymers in living fluids such as bacterial suspensions and swarms suffer bending deformations as they interact with single bacteria or with cell clusters. Often these filaments perform mechanical functions and interact with their networked environment through cross-links, or have other similar constraints placed on them. Here we examine the mechanical properties - under tension - of such constrained active filaments under canonical boundary conditions motivated by experiments. Fluctuations in the filament shape are a consequence of two types of random forces - thermal Brownian forces, and activity derived forces with specified time and space correlation functions. We derive force-extension relationships and expressions for the mean square deflections for tethered filaments under various boundary conditions including hinged and clamped constraints. The expressions for hinged-hinged boundary conditions are reminiscent of the worm-like-chain model and feature effective bending moduli and mode-dependent non-thermodynamic effective temperatures controlled by the imposed force and by the activity. Our results provide methods to estimate the activity by measurements of the force-extension relation of the filaments or their mean-square deflections which can be routinely performed using optical traps, tethered particle experiments, or other single molecule techniques.",

    "abstract": "Blood cells arise from diverse pools of stem and progenitor cells. Understanding progenitor heterogeneity is a major challenge. The Drosophila larval lymph gland is a well-studied model to understand blood progenitor maintenance and recapitulates several aspects of vertebrate hematopoiesis. However in-depth analysis has focused on progenitors located in lymph gland anterior lobes (AP), ignoring the progenitors from the posterior lobes (PP). Using in situ expression mapping and transcriptome analysis we reveal PP heterogeneity and identify molecular-genetic tools to study this abundant progenitor population. Functional analysis shows that PP resist differentiation upon immune challenge, in a JAK-STAT-dependent manner. Upon wasp parasitism, AP downregulate JAK-STAT signaling and form lamellocytes. In contrast, we show that PP activate STAT92E and remain undifferentiated. Stat92E knockdown in PP or genetically reducing JAK-STAT signaling permits PP lamellocyte differentiation. We discuss how heterogeneity and compartmentalization allow functional segregation in response to systemic cues and could be widely applicable.\n\nHighlightsWe provide an in situ and transcriptome map of larval blood progenitors Posterior lymph gland progenitors are refractory to immune challenge STAT activation after wasp parasitism maintains posterior progenitors",

    "abstract": "PurposeProstate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed neoplasm in American men. Although existing biomarkers may detect localized prostate cancer, additional strategies are necessary for improving detection and identifying aggressive disease that may require further intervention. One promising, minimally invasive biomarker is cell-free DNA (cfDNA), which consist of short DNA fragments released into circulation by dying or lysed cells that may reflect underlying cancer. Here we investigated whether differences in cfDNA concentration and cfDNA fragment size could improve the sensitivity for detecting more advanced and aggressive prostate cancer.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThis study included 268 individuals: 34 healthy controls, 112 men with localized prostate cancer who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP), and 122 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Plasma cfDNA concentration and fragment size were quantified with the Qubit 3.0 and the 2100 Bioanalyzer. The potential relationship between cfDNA concentration or fragment size and localized or mCRPC prostate cancer was evaluated with descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and area under the curve analysis with cross-validation.\n\nResultsPlasma cfDNA concentrations were elevated in mCRPC patients in comparison to localized disease (OR5 ng/mL = 1.34, P = 0.027) or to being a control (OR5 ng/mL = 1.69, P = 0.034). Decreased average fragment size was associated with an increased risk of localized disease compared to controls (OR5bp = 0.77, P = 0.0008).\n\nConclusionThis study suggests that cfDNA concentration and average cfDNA fragment size may provide a quick, cost-effective approach to help determine which patients will benefit most from further screening and/or disease monitoring to help improve prostate cancer outcomes.",
