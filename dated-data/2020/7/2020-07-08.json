    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe obligate intracellular bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis is an important human pathogen whose biphasic developmental cycle consists of an infectious elementary body and a replicative reticulate body. Whereas \u03c366, the primary sigma factor, is necessary for transcription of most chlamydial genes throughout the developmental cycle, \u03c328 is required for expression of some late genes. We previously showed that the Chlamydia-specific transcription factor GrgA physically interacts with both of these sigma factors and activates transcription from \u03c366- and \u03c328-dependent promoters in vitro. Here, we investigate the organismal functions of GrgA. We show that GrgA overexpression decreased RB proliferation via time-dependent transcriptomic changes. Significantly, \u03c366-dependent genes that code for two important transcription repressors are among the direct targets of GrgA. One of these repressors is Euo, which prevents the expression of late genes during early phases. The other is HrcA, which regulates gene expression in response to heat shock. The direct regulon of GrgA also includes a \u03c328-dependent gene that codes for the putative virulence factor PmpI. Conditional overexpression of Euo and HrcA also inhibited chlamydial growth and affected GrgA expression. Transcriptomic studies suggest that GrgA, Euo, and HrcA have distinct but overlapping indirect regulons. Furthermore, overexpression of either GrgA leads to decreased expression of numerous tRNAs. These findings indicate that a GrgA-mediated transcriptional regulatory network controls C. trachomatis growth and development.IMPORTANCE Chlamydia trachomatis is the most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterial pathogen worldwide and is a leading cause of preventable blindness in under-developed areas as well as developed countries. Previous studies showed that the novel transcription factor GrgA activated chlamydial gene transcription in vitro, but did not addressed the organismal function of GrgA. Here, we demonstrate growth inhibition in C. trachomatis engineered to conditionally overexpress GrgA. GrgA overexpression immediately increases the expression of two other critical transcription factors (Euo and HrcA) and a candidate virulence factor (PmpI), among several other genes. We also reveal chlamydial growth reduction and transcriptomic changes including decreased GrgA mRNA levels in response to either Euo or HrcA overexpression. Thus, the transcription network controlled by GrgA likely plays a crucial role in chlamydial growth and pathogenesis.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Ruminants are essential for maintaining the global population and managing greenhouse gas emissions. In the rumen, bacterial species belonging to the genera rumen Butyrivibrio and Pseudobutyrivibrio constitute the core bacterial rumen microbiome and are important degraders of plant-derived complex polysaccharides. Pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans MA3014 was selected for genome sequencing in order to examine its ability to breakdown and utilize plant polysaccharides. The complete genome sequence of MA3014 is 3.58 Mb, consists of three replicons (a chromosome, chromid and plasmid), has an overall G+C content of 39.6% and encodes 3,265 putative protein-coding genes (PCGs). Comparative pan-genomics of all cultivated and currently available P. xylanivorans genomes has revealed highly open genomes and a strong correlation of orthologous genes within this species of rumen bacteria. MA3014 is metabolically versatile and capable of utilizing a range of simple mono-or oligosaccharides to complex plant polysaccharides such as pectins, mannans, starch and hemicelluloses for growth, with lactate, butyrate and formate as the principal fermentation end-products. The genes encoding these metabolic pathways have been identified and MA3014 is predicted to encode an extensive repertoire of Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZymes) with 80 Glycoside Hydrolases (GHs), 28 Carbohydrate Esterases (CEs) and 51 Glycosyl Transferases (GTs), that suggest its role as an initiator of primary solubilization of plant matter in the rumen.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Faithful DNA replication is crucial for viability of cells across all kingdoms of life. Targeting DNA replication is a viable strategy for inhibition of bacterial pathogens. Clostridioides difficile is an important enteropathogen that causes potentially fatal intestinal inflammation. Knowledge about DNA replication in this organism is limited and no data is available on the very first steps of DNA replication. Here, we use a combination of in silico predictions and in vitro experiments to demonstrate that C. difficile employs a bipartite origin of replication that shows DnaA-dependent melting at oriC2, located in the dnaA-dnaN intergenic region. Analysis of putative origins of replication in different clostridia suggests that the main features of the origin architecture are conserved. This study is the first to characterize aspects of the origin region of C. difficile and contributes to our understanding of the initiation of DNA replication in clostridia.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Herein, we report a novel Carnobacterium-like organism, CS13T, isolated from the blood of sheep with persistent diarrhea from a grassland pasturing area in Xilingol League, Inner Mongolia Municipality, China. Homology analysis indicated that CS13T belongs to the genus Carnobacterium and is 100% related to the reported environmental microorganism Carnobacterium antarticum sp. CP1 (C. CP1), which was isolated from sandy soil near Davis Station, Antarctica; the following strains are closely related: Carnobacterium mobile DSM 4848 (97%) and Carnobacterium funditum DSM 5970 (96%). Similar to those of the C. CP1, the short rod-shaped cells of CS13T are 0.4-0.8 \u03bcm wide and 1.0-1.5 \u03bcm long; exist singly, paired or catenoid; are gram positive, non-spore forming, and facultatively anaerobic; and produce hemolysin. CS13T cannot produce gas or H2S but can ferment sucrose, galactose, salicin, and esculin to produce acid. However, in contrast to C. CP1, CS13T can produce acid from cellobiose and maltose and is weakly positive for D-mannose fermentation; the growth temperatures range from 20-37\u00b0C, the pH range is 5.0-9.0, and the G+C content is 37.84% (4-36\u00b0C, pH 6.0-9.5, and 38.1% for C. CP1). Furthermore, based on gene annotation analysis, we found that CS13T has 31 more specific genes than C. CP1 (133 to 102) and that the nonredundant protein similarity to C. CP1 is only 84.2%. Based on the physiological-biochemical and genetic analysis results, we infer that the organisms isolated from the Mongolian Plateau and sandy soil in Antarctica belong to the same novel species of the genus Carnobacterium; therefore, this novel species probably has distributed globally and should not be called species antarticum.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Malaria is caused by unicellular Plasmodium parasites. Plasmodium relies on diverse microtubule cytoskeletal structures for its reproduction, multiplication or dissemination. Due to the small size of this parasite, its cytoskeleton has been primarily observable by electron microscopy. Here, we demonstrate that the nanoscale cytoskeleton organization is within reach using ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM). In developing microgametocytes, U-ExM allows to monitor the dynamic assembly of axonemes and concomitant tubulin polyglutamylation in whole cells. In the invasive merozoite and ookinete forms, U-ExM unveils the subpellicular microtubule arrays that confer cell rigidity. In ookinete, we additionally identify an apical tubulin ring above the subpellicular microtubules that colocalises with markers of the conoid in related Apicomplexa parasites. This microtubule structure was presumed to be lost in Plasmodium despite its crucial role in both motility and invasion in most apicomplexans. Here, U-ExM reveals that a divergent and reduced form of the conoid is actually conserved in the Plasmodium genus.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe Fis nucleoid-associated protein controls the expression of a large and diverse regulon of genes in Gram-negative bacteria. Fis production is normally maximal in bacteria during the early exponential phase of batch culture growth, becoming almost undetectable by the onset of stationary phase. We tested the effect on the Fis regulatory network in Salmonella of moving the complete fis gene from its usual location near the origin of chromosomal replication to the position normally occupied by the dps gene in the Right macrodomain of the chromosome, and vice versa, creating the strain GX. In a parallel experiment, we tested the effect of rewiring the Fis regulatory network by placing the fis open reading frame under the control of the stationary-phase-activated dps promoter at the dps genetic location within Ter, and vice versa, creating the strain OX. ChIP-seq was used to measure global Fis protein binding and gene expression patterns. Strain GX showed few changes when compared with the wild type, although we did detect increased Fis binding at Ter, accompanied by reduced binding at Ori. Strain OX displayed a more pronounced version of this distorted Fis protein-binding pattern together with numerous alterations in the expression of genes in the Fis regulon. OX, but not GX, had a reduced ability to infect cultured mammalian cells. These findings illustrate the inherent robustness of the Fis regulatory network to rewiring based on gene repositioning alone and emphasise the importance of fis expression signals in phenotypic determination.IMPORTANCE We assessed the impacts on Salmonella physiology of reciprocally translocating the genes encoding the Fis and Dps nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs), and of inverting their growth phase production patterns such that Fis is produced in stationary phase (like Dps) and Dps is produced in exponential phase (like Fis). Changes to peak binding of Fis were detected by ChIP-seq on the chromosome, as were widespread impacts on the transcriptome, especially when Fis production mimicked Dps. Virulence gene expression and the expression of a virulence phenotype were altered. Overall, these radical changes to NAP gene expression were well tolerated, revealing the robust and well-buffered nature of global gene regulation networks in the bacterium.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

There are currently no antiviral drugs or vaccines to treat COVID-19, and the failure to identify effective interventions can be blamed on our incomplete understanding of the nature of this virus and its host cell infection process. Here, we experimentally determined structural maps of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome in infected human cells and also characterized in vitro refolded RNA structures for SARS-CoV-2 and 6 other coronaviruses. Our in vivo data confirms several structural elements predicted from theoretical analysis and goes much further in revealing many previously unknown structural features that functionally impact viral translation and discontinuous transcription in cells. Importantly, we harnessed our in vivo structure data alongside a deep-learning tool and accurately predicted several dozen functionally related host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome, none of which were known previously. Thus, our in vivo structural study lays a foundation for coronavirus RNA biology and indicates promising directions for the rapid development of therapeutics to treat COVID-19.HIGHLIGHTSWe mapped the in vivo structure and built secondary structural models of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genomeWe discovered functionally impactful structural features in the RNA genomes of multiple coronavirusesWe predicted and validated host cell proteins that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome based on our in vivo RNA structural data using a deep-learning toolCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTMouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) encodes a Rem precursor protein that specifies both regulatory and accessory functions. Rem is cleaved at the ER membrane into a functional N-terminal signal peptide (SP) and the C-terminus (Rem-CT). Rem-CT lacks a membrane-spanning domain and a known ER retention signal, yet was not detectably secreted into cell supernatants. Inhibition of intracellular trafficking by the drug Brefeldin A (BFA), which interferes with the ER to Golgi secretory pathway, resulted in dramatically reduced intracellular Rem-CT levels. A Rem mutant lacking glycosylation sites was cleaved into SP and Rem-CT, but was insensitive to BFA, suggesting that unglycosylated Rem-CT does not exit the ER or reach a degradative compartment. BFA reduction of Rem-CT levels was not rescued by proteasome or lysosomal inhibitors. Rem-CT has simple glycans, which are necessary for Rem-CT stability and trafficking, but indicate that Rem-CT does not traffic through the Golgi. Analysis of wild-type Rem-CT and its glycosylation mutant by confocal microscopy revealed that both were primarily localized to the ER lumen. A small fraction of wild-type Rem-CT, but not the unglycosylated mutant, were co-localized with Rab5+ endosomes. Expression of a dominant-negative (DN) form of ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) (T31N) mimicked the effects of BFA by reducing Rem-CT levels, suggesting that Arf1 prevents Rem-CT localization to a degradative compartment. A DN form of the AAA ATPase, p97/VCP, rescued Rem-CT in the presence of BFA or DN Arf1. Thus, Rem-CT uses an unconventional trafficking scheme, perhaps to thwart innate immunity to MMTV infection.IMPORTANCE Mouse mammary tumor virus is a complex retrovirus that encodes a regulatory/accessory protein, Rem. Rem is a precursor protein that is processed at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by signal peptidase. The N-terminal SP eludes ER-associated degradation to traffic to the nucleus and serve a human immunodeficiency virus Rev-like function. In contrast, the function of the C-terminal glycosylated cleavage product (Rem-CT) is unknown. Since localization is critical for protein function, we used multiple methods to localize Rem-CT. Surprisingly, Rem-CT, which lacks a transmembrane domain or an ER retention signal, was detected primarily within the ER and required glycosylation for trafficking to endosomes. Blocking of retrograde trafficking through Arf1 reduced Rem-CT levels, but was not restored by lysosomal or proteasomal inhibitors. The unique trafficking of Rem-CT suggests a novel intracellular trafficking pathway, potentially impacting host anti-viral immunity.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "MtrR is a negative regulator of MtrCDE efflux pump. Various N-Terminal and C-Terminal mutations have been reported in different multidrug resistant clinical isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae across the world. Mutations in N-terminal region of MtrR, are known to abrogate its binding with the promoter thereby providing an evidence that this region encodes for DNA binding domain. In contrast, mechanism of action of mutations in C-terminal, known to play a role in protein dimerization and has site for ligand binding, is left unexplored. In the present study, using in silico approach, we observed that H105Y mutation affects the conformation of the protein and its binding with penicillin. Purified, recombinant wild type and mutant MtrR were compared for their binding to promoter region and various antibiotics. Fluorescence spectroscopy, CD spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering assay with wild type and mutant MtrR suggested decreased binding of H105Y MtrR with its promoter without affecting protein dimerization, but due to altered conformation of mutant dimer. Our in silico results also suggest altered conformation of the mutant dimer protein leading to difference in the posture of homodimer formed and hence altered binding with DNA. Mutant protein also showed stronger binding with various antibiotics: penicillin, ceftriaxone and ofloxacin. Binding of drugs also leads to altered conformation of the protein which may lead to its decreased binding with the promoter DNA.Importance Mutations in MtrR, a transcriptional repressor of MtrCDE efflux pump have been reported in various multi-drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae across the world. We identified that a C-terminal mutation H105Y, outside the DNA binding domain of MtrR, decreases the binding of MtrR with its promoter. We identified that the mutation alters the structure of the dimer, as well as enhances the antibiotic binding. We envisage that the altered structure of MtrR affects its DNA binding thereby increasing efflux of antibiotics and increased resistance. These findings could be used as a guide to design novel drugs that should either not bind to MtrR or could surpass the conformational change and decreased DNA binding.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTChinese sacbrood virus (CSBV) is a serious threat to eastern honeybees (Apis cerana), especially larvae. However, the pathological mechanism of this deadly disease is remains unclear. Here, we employed an mRNA-seq and sRNA-seq approach in healthy and CSBV-infected 3rd Apis cerana larval. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis of 203 differentially expressed genes showed that CSBV infection affected host development by up-regulating the expression of larval cuticle proteins, such as larval cuticle proteins A1A and A3A, resulting in elevated susceptibility to CSBV. In addition, viral infection not only affected the expression of serine protease related to the melanization pathway and but also altered fatty acid metabolism and biosynthesis, thus progressed to disturb host immune response. Interestingly, GO annotation and KEGG analysis on target genes of CSBV-specific siRNA (vsiRNAs) showed that serine/threonine kinase activity and serine-type endopeptidas as well as fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly enriched (P &lt; 0.05). Among these vsiRNAs, vsiRNA-1441 with relatively high expression targeted extracellular serine/threonine protein kinase. This study provides new evidence that CSBV attacks a distinct immune response pathway and mediates the expression of cuticle protein to gain the more chance of proliferation.IMPORTANCE Chinese sacbrood virus (CSBV) is the major factor threatening the health of Apis cerana. Although honeybees have antiviral defense mechanisms including RNA-interference (RNAi), virus had evolved resistance strategy like virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNA) produced during the viral infection, which can alter host immune by hijacking the host RNAi pathway. To gain insights at the transcription level into the mechanisms vsiRNA altering immune response and how this variation is connected with CSBV infection, we performed the first combined mRNA and small RNA-seq analyses of healthy and CSBV-infected Apis cerana larvae. Together, the omics approach enabled us to obtain comprehensive results that CSBV infection changed the expressions of cuticle proteins and related serine protease, and leading to the larvae unable to pupate. This will guide the design of new strategies for control CSBV.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTSphingobium sp. strain SYK-6 is an alphaproteobacterial degrader of lignin-derived aromatic compounds, which can degrade all the stereoisomers of \u03b2-aryl ether-type compounds. SYK-6 cells convert four stereoisomers of guaiacylglycerol-\u03b2-guaiacyl ether (GGE) into two enantiomers of \u03b1-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-\u03b2-hydroxypropiovanillone (MPHPV) through GGE \u03b1-carbon atom oxidation by stereoselective C\u03b1-dehydrogenases encoded by ligD, ligL, and ligN. The ether linkages of the resulting MPHPV enantiomers are cleaved by stereoselective glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) encoded by ligF, ligE, and ligP, generating (\u03b2R\u03b2S)-\u03b1-glutathionyl-\u03b2-hydroxypropiovanillone (GS-HPV) and guaiacol. To date, it has been shown that the gene products of ligG and SLG_04120 (ligQ), both encoding GST, catalyze glutathione removal from (\u03b2R\u03b2S)-GS-HPV, forming achiral \u03b2-hydroxypropiovanillone. In this study, we characterized the enzyme properties of LigG and LigQ and elucidated their roles in \u03b2-aryl ether catabolism. Purified LigG showed an approximately 300-fold higher specific activity for (\u03b2R)-GS-HPV than that for (\u03b2S)-GS-HPV, whereas purified LigQ showed an approximately six-fold higher specific activity for (\u03b2S)-GS-HPV than that for (\u03b2R)-GS-HPV. Analyses of mutants of ligG, ligQ, and both genes revealed that SYK-6 converted (\u03b2R)-GS-HPV using both LigG and LigQ, whereas only LigQ was involved in converting (\u03b2S)-GS-HPV. Furthermore, the disruption of both ligG and ligQ was observed to lead to the loss of the capability of SYK-6 to convert MPHPV. This suggests that GSH removal from GS-HPV catalyzed by LigG and LigQ, is essential for cellular GSH recycling during \u03b2-aryl ether catabolism.IMPORTANCE The \u03b2-aryl ether linkage is most abundant in lignin, comprising 45%\u201362% of all intermonomer linkages in lignin; thus, cleavage of the \u03b2-aryl ether linkage together with the subsequent degradation process is considered the essential step in lignin biodegradation. The enzyme genes for \u03b2-aryl ether cleavage are useful for decomposing high-molecular-weight lignin, converting lignin-derived aromatic compounds into value-added products, and modifying lignin structures in plants to reduce lignin recalcitrance. In this study, we uncovered the roles of the two glutathione S-transferase genes, ligG and ligQ, in the conversion of GS-HPV isomers, which are generated in the \u03b2-aryl ether cleavage pathway in SYK-6. Adding our current results to previous findings allowed us to have a whole picture of the \u03b2-aryl ether cleavage system in SYK-6.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance has become a major public health concern as bacteria evolve to evade drugs, leading to recurring infections and a decrease in antibiotic efficacy. Systematic efforts have revealed mechanisms involved in resistance; yet, in many cases, how these specific mechanisms accelerate or slow the evolution of resistance remains unclear. Here, we conducted a systematic study of the impact of the AcrAB-TolC efflux pump on the evolution of antibiotic resistance. We mapped how population growth rate and resistance change over time as a function of both the antibiotic concentration and the parent strains genetic background. We compared the wild type strain to a strain overexpressing AcrAB-TolC pumps and a strain lacking functional pumps. In all cases, resistance emerged when cultures were treated with chloramphenicol concentrations near the MIC of their respective parent strain. The genetic background of the parent strain also influenced resistance acquisition. The wild type strain evolved resistance within 24 h through mutations in the acrAB operon and its associated regulators. Meanwhile, the strain overexpressing AcrAB-TolC evolved resistance more slowly than the wild type strain; this strain achieved resistance in part through point mutations in acrB and the acrAB promoter. Surprisingly, the strain without functional AcrAB-TolC efflux pumps still gained resistance, which it achieved through upregulation of redundant efflux pumps. Overall, our results suggest that treatment conditions just above the MIC pose the largest risk for the evolution of resistance and that AcrAB-TolC efflux pumps impact the pathway by which chloramphenicol resistance is achieved.\n\nIMPORTANCECombatting the rise of antibiotic resistance is a significant challenge. Efflux pumps are an important contributor to drug resistance; they exist across many cell types and can export numerous classes of antibiotics. Cells can regulate pump expression to maintain low intracellular drug concentrations. Here, we explored how resistance emerged depending on the antibiotic concentration, as well as the presence of efflux pumps and their regulators. We found that treatments near antibiotic concentrations that inhibit the parent strains growth were most likely to promote resistance. While wild type, pump overexpression, and pump knock out strains were all able to evolve resistance, they differed in the absolute level of resistance evolved, the speed at which they achieved resistance, and the genetic pathways involved. These results indicate that specific treatment regimens may be especially problematic for the evolution of resistance and that the strain background can influence how resistance is achieved.",

    "abstract": "With the help of novel processing workflows and algorithms, we have obtained a better understanding of the flexibility and conformational dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 spike in the prefusion state. We have re-analyzed previous cryo-EM data combining 3D clustering approaches with ways to explore a continuous flexibility space based on 3D Principal Component Analysis. These advanced analyses revealed a concerted motion involving the receptor-binding domain (RBD), N-terminal domain (NTD), and subdomain 1 and 2 (SD1 &amp; SD2) around the previously characterized 1-RBD-up state, which have been modeled as elastic deformations. We show that in this dataset there are not well-defined, stable, spike conformations, but virtually a continuum of states moving in a concerted fashion. We obtained an improved resolution ensemble map with minimum bias, from which we model by flexible fitting the extremes of the change along the direction of maximal variance. Moreover, a high-resolution structure of a recently described biochemically stabilized form of the spike is shown to greatly reduce the dynamics observed for the wild-type spike. Our results provide new detailed avenues to potentially restrain the spike dynamics for structure-based drug and vaccine design and at the same time give a warning of the potential image processing classification instability of these complicated datasets, having a direct impact on the interpretability of the results.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

In addition, we observed septal junctions in vegetative septa, likely involved in effector translocation between neighbouring cells. During sporulation, the cell envelope undergoes dramatic remodeling, including the formation of a spore cortex and two protective proteinaceous layers.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTCLSI and EUCAST recommends that only broth microdilution (BMD) should be used for routine colistin susceptibility testing, however, it could be difficult to perform in resource-poor settings. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of an agar spot test (COL-AS) and a colistin drop test (COL-DT) as compared to BMD. COL-AS and COL-DT were challenged with a collection of 271 Gram-negative bacilli clinical isolates: 195 Enterobacterales (including 63 mcr-1 positive strains), 37 Acinetobacter spp. and 39 P. aeruginosa. For COL-AS, 3.0\u00b5g/ml (final concentration) of colistin was added to a Mueller-Hinton agar plate and subsequently swabbed with a 0.5 McFarland suspension of tested strain within 1cm2 spot. For COL-DT, 10\u00b5l of a 16\u00b5g/ml colistin solution was dripped on the surface of a Mueller-Hinton agar plate, previously inoculated with a lawn of tested strain (0.5 McFarland). Colistin solution was made either, by dissolving powder or by disk elution in CA-MHB. Overall, 141/271 (52%) isolates were categorized as colistin resistant by reference BMD. COL-AS yielded a categorical agreement (CA) of 95.5% compared to BMD, with 0.7% very major errors and 3.8% major errors. COL-DR yielded a CA of 96.2% compared to BMD, with 0.7% and 0% very major errors and 3.1% and 3.8% major errors, for colistin powder and disk elution solutions, respectively. Most major errors occurred for mcr-1 producing strains with MICs that fluctuated from 2 to 4 \u03bcg/ml. In conclusion, we developed and validated methods suited to the systematic screening of resistance to colistin in gram negative bacilli.Clinical relevance colistin continues to be one of the last-line therapeutic options to treat carbapenemase-producing gram negative bacilli. The BMD reference methodology, the only one accepted by current standards for evaluating colistin sensitivity, is difficult to implement in laboratories from low-resource countries. In this work, we propose two simple methodologies to screen for colistin resistance, with a performance equivalent to the reference method in detecting resistance to colistin, both of plasmid (mcr) and chromosomal nature. Furthermore, the methods validated here allowed a better identification of those producers of mcr producer with borderline MICs. These screening tests can be routinely performed in addition to the tests currently in use. showed long stability during storage and some of them do not require colistin powder as the source of antibiotic, an important limitation in low-resource countries.View Full Text",

The developmental  alarm clock of speciation sounds off when sufficient divergence in genetic control of development leads hybrid individuals to infertility or inviability, the world awoken to the dawn of new species with intrinsic post-zygotic reproductive isolation. Some developmental stages will be more prone to hybrid dysfunction due to how molecular evolution interacts with the ontogenetic timing of gene expression. Considering the ontogeny of hybrid incompatibilities provides a profitable connection between  evo-devo and speciation genetics to better link macroevolutionary pattern, microevolutionary process, and molecular mechanisms. Here we explore speciation alongside development, emphasizing their mutual dependence on genetic network features, fitness landscapes, and developmental system drift. We assess models for how ontogenetic timing of reproductive isolation can be predictable. Experiments and theory within this synthetic perspective can help identify new rules of speciation as well as rules in the molecular evolution of development.\n\nImpact StatementIntegrating speciation genetics with ontogeny can identify predictable rules in the molecular evolution of developmental pathways and in the accumulation of reproductive isolation as genomes diverge.",

    "abstract": "Salmonellae display intricate evolutionary patterns comprising over 2500 serovars having diverse pathogenic profiles. The acquisition/exchange of various virulence factors influence the evolutionary framework. To gain insights into evolution of Salmonella as a pathogen in association with the CRISPR-Cas genes we performed phylogenetic surveillance across strains of 22 Salmonella serovars. The strains assorted into two main clades, pertaining to the differences in their CRISPR1-leader and cas operon. Considering Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium and serovar Typhi as signature serovars, we classified the clades as CRISPR1-STM/cas-STM and CRISPR1-STY/cas-STY, respectively. Serovars of the two clades displayed better relatedness, concerning CRISPR-1 leader and cas operon, across genera than between themselves. This signifies the acquisition of CRISPR1/Cas region a horizontal gene transfer event owing to the presence of mobile genetic elements flanking CRISPR1 array. The CRISPR2 tree does not show such relation. Spacer mapping of the two CRISPR arrays suggests the construct to be canonical, with only 8.8% spacer conservation among the serovars. As opposed to broad-host-range serovars, the host-specific serovars harbor fewer spacers. All typhoidal serovars have CRISPR1-STY/cas-STY system. Comparison of CRISPR and cas phenograms with that of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) suggests differential evolution of CRISPR/Cas system implying supplementary roles beyond immunity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Differences in recombination rate between females and males are perhaps the most striking form of this variation. To determine how sex shapes the evolution of recombination, we directly compared the genome-wide recombination rate in females and males across a common set of genetic backgrounds in house mouse. Our results reveal highly discordant evolutionary trajectories in the two sexes. Whereas male recombination rates show rapid evolution over short timescales, female recombination rates measured in the same strains are mostly static. Strains with high recombination in males have more double-strand breaks and stronger crossover interference than strains with low recombination in males, suggesting that these factors contribute to the sex-specific evolution we document.

    "abstract": "Antagonistic interactions between hosts and parasites may drive the evolution of novel host defenses, or new parasite strategies. Host immunity is therefore one of the fastest evolving traits. But where do the novel immune traits come from? Here, we test for phylogenetic conservation in a rapidly evolving immune trait - peritoneal fibrosis. Peritoneal fibrosis is a costly defense against novel specialist tapeworm Schistocephalus solidus (Cestoda) expressed in some freshwater populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus, Perciformes). We asked whether stickleback fibrosis is a derived species-specific trait or an ancestral immune response that was widely distributed across ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) only to be employed by threespine stickleback against the specialist parasite. We combined literature review on peritoneal fibrosis with a comparative experiment using either parasite-specific, or non-specific, immune challenge in deliberately selected species across fish tree of life. We show that ray-finned fish are broadly, but not universally, able to induce peritoneal fibrosis when challenged with a generic stimulus (Alum adjuvant). The experimental species were, however, largely indifferent to the tapeworm antigen homogenate. Peritoneal fibrosis, thus, appears to be a common and deeply conserved fish immune response that was co-opted by stickleback to adapt to a new selective challenge.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTAnimals have evolved numerous strategies to cope with energetic challenges, with dynamic changes to the gut microbiome potentially constituting one such strategy. We tested how proxies of food availability (rainfall) and thermoregulatory stress (temperature) predicted gut microbiome composition of geladas (Theropithecus geladas), a grazing, high-altitude primate inhabiting a seasonal environment. The gelada gut microbiome varied across seasons, reflecting more efficient digestion of the primary foods eaten at certain times of year. In rainier periods, the gut was dominated by cellulolytic/fermentative bacteria that specialized in digesting grass, while during dry periods the gut was dominated by bacteria that break down starches found in underground plant parts. Temperature had a smaller, but detectable, effect on the gut microbiome. We found an increase in microbes involved in metabolism and energy production during cold and dry periods, suggesting buffering when thermoregulatory and nutritional stress co-occurred.

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is a prominent mechanism for coping with variable environments, and a key determinant of extinction risk. Evolutionary theory predicts that phenotypic plasticity should evolve to lower levels in environments that fluctuate less predictably, because they induce mismatches between plastic responses and selective pressures. However this prediction is difficult to test in nature, where environmental predictability is not controlled. Here, we exposed 32 lines of the halotolerant microalga Dunaliella salina to ecologically realistic, randomly fluctuating salinity, with varying levels of predictability, for 500 generations. We found that morphological plasticity evolved to lower levels in lines that experienced less predictable environments. Evolution of plasticity mostly concerned phases with slow population growth, rather than the exponential phase where microbes are typically phenotyped. This study underlines that long-term experiments with complex patterns of environmental change are needed to test theories about population responses to altered environmental predictability, as currently observed under climate change.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",
