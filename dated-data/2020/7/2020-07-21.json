    "abstract": "Hourly temperature was measured for approximately one year at 17 stations in three caves in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Thirteen of these stations were in the extensive twilight zones of all three caves. All seventeen stations showed seasonality in temperature with a 3 {degrees}C drop during the Nortes season. Two of the caves, Muevelo Sabrosito and Muevelo Rico, showed greater variability during the winter months while in Rio Secreto variability was greatest during the rainy season. Rio Secreto is less open to the surface than the other two. All sites also showed a daily temperature cycle, although it was very faint in some Rio Secreto sites. While temperature variability is diminished relative to surface variation, its temporal pattern is worthy of further study.",

    "abstract": "Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) has been widely used to identify gene sets with statistically significant difference between cases and controls against a large gene set. GSEA needs both phenotype labels and expression of genes. However, gene expression are assessed more often for model organisms than minor species. More importantly, gene expression could not be measured under specific conditions for human, due to high healthy risk of direct experiments, such as non-approved treatment or gene knockout, and then often substituted by mouse. Thus predicting enrichment significance (on a phenotype) of a given gene set of a species (target, say human), by using gene expression measured under the same phenotype of the other species (source, say mouse) is a vital and challenging problem, which we call CROSS-species Gene Set Enrichment Problem (XGSEP). For XGSEP, we propose XGSEA (Cross-species Gene Set Enrichment Analysis), with three steps of: 1) running GSEA for a source species to obtain enrichment scores and p-values of source gene sets; 2) representing the relation between source and target gene sets by domain adaptation; and 3) using regression to predict p-values of target gene sets, based on the representation in 2). We extensively validated XGSEA by using four real data sets under various settings, proving that XGSEA significantly outperformed three baseline methods. A case study of identifying important human pathways for T cell dysfunction and reprogramming from mouse ATAC-Seq data further confirmed the reliability of XGSEA. Source code is available through https://github.com/LiminLi-xjtu/XGSEA\n\nAuthor summaryGene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) is a powerful tool in the gene sets differential analysis given a ranked gene list. GSEA requires complete data, gene expression with phenotype labels. However, gene expression could not be measured under specific conditions for human, due to high risk of direct experiments, such as non-approved treatment or gene knockout, and then often substituted by mouse. Thus no availability of gene expression leads to more challenging problem, CROSS-species Gene Set Enrichment Problem (XGSEP), in which enrichment significance (on a phenotype) of a given gene set of a species (target, say human) is predicted by using gene expression measured under the same phenotype of the other species (source, say mouse). In this work, we propose XGSEA (Cross-species Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) for XGSEP, with three steps of: 1) GSEA; 2) domain adaptation; and 3) regression. The results of four real data sets and a case study indicate that XGSEA significantly outperformed three baseline methods and confirmed the reliability of XGSEA.",

    "abstract": "A key aspect in defining cell state is the complex choreography of DNA binding events in a given cell type, which in turn establishes a cell-specific gene-expression program. In the past two decades since the sequencing of the human genome there has been a deluge of genome-wide experiments which have measured gene-expression and DNA binding events across numerous cell-types and tissues. Here we re-analyze ENCODE data in a highly reproducible manner by utilizing standardized analysis pipelines, containerization, and literate programming with Rmarkdown. Our approach validated many findings from previous independent studies, underscoring the importance of ENCODEs goals in providing these reproducible data resources. This approach also revealed several new findings: (i) 1,362 promoters, termed  reservoirs, have up to 111 different DNA binding-proteins localized on one promoter yet do not have any expression of steady-state RNA (ii) The human specific SVA repeat element may have been co-opted for enhancer regulation. Collectively, this study performed by the students of a CU Boulder computational biology class (BCHM 5631 - Spring 2020) demonstrates the value of reproducible findings and how resources like ENCODE that prioritize data standards can foster new findings with existing data in a didactic environment.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A streptococcus; GAS) is an important human pathogen responsible for mild to severe, life-threatening infections. GAS expresses a wide range of virulence factors, including the M family proteins. The M proteins allow the bacteria to evade parts of the human immune defenses by triggering the formation of a dense coat of plasma proteins surrounding the bacteria, including IgGs. However, the molecular level details of the M1-IgG interaction have remained unclear. Here, we characterized the structure and dynamics of this interaction interface in human plasma on the surface of live bacteria using integrative structural biology, combining cross-linking mass spectrometry and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We show that the primary interaction is formed between the S-domain of M1 and the conserved IgG Fc-domain. In addition, we show evidence for a so far uncharacterized interaction between the A-domain and the IgG Fc-domain. Both these interactions mimic the protein G-IgG interface of group C and G streptococcus. These findings underline a conserved scavenging mechanism used by GAS surface proteins that block the IgG-receptor (Fc{gamma}R) to inhibit phagocytic killing. We additionally show that we can capture Fab-bound IgGs in a complex background and identify the specific M1 epitopes targeted on live bacteria. Our results elucidate the M1-IgG interaction network involved in inhibition of phagocytosis and reveal important M1 peptides that can be further investigated as future vaccine targets.",

Class-I HDAC, HDAC-1 forms three types of complexes, namely the Nucleosome Remodeling Deacetylase complex, the Sin3 complex, and the CoREST complex, with specific corepressor component Mi2/CHD-3, Sin3, and RCOR1 in human, respectively. The functions of these HDAC-1 complexes are regulated by their corepressors, however, their exact mechanistic roles in several biological processes remain unexplored, such as in embryonic development. Here, we report that each of the corepressors, LET-418, SIN-3, and SPR-1, the homologous of Mi2, Sin3, and RCOR1, respectively, were expressed throughout Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic development and served essential roles in the process. Moreover, genetic analysis suggested that three pathways (i.e., LET-418- SIN-3-SPR-1, SIN-3-SPR-1, and LET-418) participated in embryonic development. Our terminal-phenotype observations of single mutants of each corepressor implied that LET-418, SIN-3, and SPR-1 played similar roles in promoting advancement to the middle and late embryonic stages. Genome-wide comparative-transcriptome analysis indicated that 47.5% and 42.3% of genes were commonly increased and decreased in sin-3 and spr-1 mutants, respectively. These results suggest that among the three pathways studied, the SIN-3-SPR-1 pathway mainly serves to regulate embryonic development. Comparative-Gene Ontology analysis indicated that these three pathways played overlapping and distinct roles in regulating C. elegans embryonic development.",

Both appendages present a generic wing-like shape associated with lift generation and low drag.

Hydrodynamic performance of the fin cross-sections was examined with the CFD software and compared with similar engineered airfoils. Affinity of hydrodynamic design of both appendages was found in a wing-like planform and cross-sectional design optimized for lift generation. Distinctions in the planform and cross-sections were found related with the fin specialization in thrust production or swimming stability control. Cross-sectional design of the dorsal fin was found to be optimized for the narrow range of small angles of attack. Cross-sections of tail flukes were found to be more stable for higher angles of attack and had gradual stall characteristics that is associated with their propulsive efficiency as oscillating foils. The results obtained are the evidence of divergent evolutionary pathways of a generic wing-like shape of the fins of cetaceans under specific demands of thrust production and swimming stability control.",

Previously, we showed that \"partner-serving\" should be defined as increased benefit supply rate per intake benefit (Hart & Pineda et al., 2019). Here, we report that \"win-win\" mutations can rapidly evolve even in nascent cooperation under conditions unfavorable for cooperation. Specifically, in a well-mixed environment we evolved engineered yeast cooperative communities where two strains exchanged costly metabolites lysine and hypoxanthine. Among cells that consumed lysine and released hypoxanthine, ecm21 mutations repeatedly arose. ecm21 is \"self-serving\", improving selfs growth rate in limiting lysine. ecm21 is also \"partner-serving\", increasing hypoxanthine release rate per lysine consumption and the steady state growth rate of partner. ecm21 also arose in monocultures evolving in lysine-limited chemostats. Thus, even without any pressure to maintain cooperation, pleiotropic win-win mutations may readily evolve.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade there has been an increasing focus on the application of the Wright-Fisher diffusion to the inference of natural selection from genetic time series. A key ingredient for modelling the trajectory of gene frequencies through the Wright-Fisher diffusion is its transition probability density function. Recent advances in DNA sequencing techniques have made it possible to monitor genomes in great detail over time, which presents opportunities for investigating natural selection while accounting for genetic recombination and local linkage. However, most existing methods for computing the transition probability density function of the Wright-Fisher diffusion are only applicable to one-locus problems. To address two-locus problems, in this work we propose a novel numerical scheme for the Wright-Fisher stochastic differential equation of population dynamics under natural selection at two linked loci. Our key innovation is that we reformulate the stochastic differential equation in a closed form that is amenable to simulation, which enables us to avoid boundary issues and reduce computational costs. We also propose an adaptive importance sampling approach based on the proposal introduced by Fearnhead (2008) for computing the transition probability density of the Wright-Fisher diffusion between any two observed states. We show through extensive simulation studies that our approach can achieve comparable performance to the method of Fearnhead (2008) but can avoid manually tuning the parameter{rho} to deliver superior performance for different observed states.",

    "abstract": "Both pathogenesis and detection of liver fibrosis and early cirrhosis are elusive. Our study focused on role of microRNAs (miRNAs) as predictive biomarkers of liver fibrosis and early cirrhosis. Methods: We recruited patients with chronic hepatitis B background and divided them into three subgroups according to the pathological staging results: no liver fibrosis group (CHB 11, 12.0%), liver fibrosis group but without liver cirrhosis (LF 41, 44.6%), and early liver cirrhosis group (LC 40, 43.4%). Results: Levels of miR-122 in the CHB and LF group were significantly elevated compared with the LC group. Meanwhile, upregulation levels of miR-146a-5p, miR-29c-3p, miR-223 were seen in the CHB group versus LC. MiR-122-5p was best able to differentiate between patients with LC and without LC (area under the curve (AUC) 0.734). It can also distinguish patients with LF from those without LF (AUC 0.681). Panel including miR-122-5p miR-29c-3p and miR-381-3p resulted in an AUC of 0.700 in detection of LF. Meanwhile panel including miR-122-5p, miR-29c-3p, MiR-223 turned out to be good predictors, resulted in an AUC of 0.752 to discriminate LC in HBV-associated disease. HBV load, ALT and AST showed significant positive correlation with miR-122-5p and miR-381-3p. Conclusions: Our study explored changes of plasm miRNA levels in HBV-associated disease patients, constructed diagnostic miRNAs panel to predict liver fibrosis and early cirrhosis.

This assumption is fundamental to theories explaining how we learn quickly, think creatively, and act flexibly. However, neural evidence for a verifiably generative abstract task representation has been lacking. Here, we report an experimental paradigm that requires forming such a representation to act adaptively in novel conditions without feedback. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we observed that abstract task structure was represented within left mid-lateral prefrontal cortex, bilateral precuneus and inferior parietal cortex. These results provide support for the neural instantiation of the long-supposed abstract task representation in a setting where we can verify its influence. Such a representation can afford massive expansions of behavioral flexibility without additional experience, a vital characteristic of human cognition.",

We demonstrate T-type currents are indispensable for both processes, as treatment with NNC-55-0396 prevented the membrane depolarization and rheobase changes induced by leptin in cultured mouse POMC neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrate TRPC1/C5 channels and CaV3.1 and CaV3.2 channels co-exist in complex. The functional relevance of this complex was corroborated using intracellular Ca2+ chelators; intracellular BAPTA (but not EGTA) application was sufficient to preclude POMC neuron excitability by preventing leptin-induced calcium influx through TRPC channels and T-type channel function.\n\nWe conclude T-type channels are integral in POMC neuron excitability. Leptin activation of TRPC channels existing in a macromolecular complex with T-type channels recruits the latter by locally-induced membrane depolarization, further depolarizing POMC neurons, triggering action potentials and excitability.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in the transcription factor FOXP1 are strongly associated with autism. Dopamine receptor 2 expressing (D2) striatal projection neurons (SPNs) in heterozygous Foxp1 (Foxp1+/-) mice have higher intrinsic excitability. To understand the mechanisms underlying this alteration, we examined SPNs with cell-type specific homozygous Foxp1 deletion to study cell-autonomous regulation by Foxp1. As in Foxp1+/- mice, D2 SPNs had increased intrinsic excitability with homozygous Foxp1 deletion. This effect involved postnatal mechanisms. The hyperexcitability was mainly due to down-regulation of two classes of potassium currents: inwardly rectifying (KIR) and leak (KLeak). Single-cell RNA sequencing data from D2 SPNs with Foxp1 deletion indicated the down-regulation of transcripts of candidate ion channels that may underlie these currents: Kcnj2 and Kcnj4 for KIR and Kcnk2 for KLeak. This Foxp1-dependent regulation was neuron-type specific since these same currents and transcripts were either unchanged, or very little changed, in D1 SPNs with cell-specific Foxp1 deletion. Our data are consistent with a model where FOXP1 negatively regulates the excitability of D2 SPNs through KIR and KLeak by transcriptionally activating their corresponding transcripts. This, in turn, provides a novel example of how a transcription factor may regulate multiple genes to impact neuronal electrophysiological function that depends on the integration of multiple current types - and do this in a cell-specific fashion. Our findings provide initial clues to altered neuronal function and possible therapeutic strategies not only for FOXP1-associated autism but also for other autism forms associated with transcription factor dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent cortical network dynamics plays a crucial role for sequential information processing in the brain. While the theoretical framework of reservoir computing provides a conceptual basis for the understanding of recurrent neural computation, it often requires manual adjustments of global network parameters, in particular of the spectral radius of the recurrent synaptic weight matrix. Being a mathematical and relatively complex quantity, the spectral radius is not readily accessible to biological neural networks, which generally adhere to the principle that information about the network state should either be encoded in local intrinsic dynamical quantities (e.g. membrane potentials), or transmitted via synaptic connectivity. We present two synaptic scaling rules for echo state networks that solely rely on locally accessible variables. Both rules work online, in the presence of a continuous stream of input signals. The first rule, termed flow control, is based on a local comparison between the mean squared recurrent membrane potential and the mean squared activity of the neuron itself. It is derived from a global scaling condition on the dynamic flow of neural activities and requires the separability of external and recurrent input currents. We gained further insight into the adaptation dynamics of flow control by using a mean field approximation on the variances of neural activities that allowed us to describe the interplay between network activity and adaptation as a two-dimensional dynamical system. The second rule that we considered, variance control, directly regulates the variance of neural activities by locally scaling the recurrent synaptic weights. The target set point of this homeostatic mechanism is dynamically determined as a function of the variance of the locally measured external input. This functional relation was derived from the same mean-field approach that was used to describe the approximate dynamics of flow control.\n\nThe effectiveness of the presented mechanisms was tested numerically using different external input protocols. The network performance after adaptation was evaluated by training the network to perform a time delayed XOR operation on binary sequences. As our main result, we found that flow control can reliably regulate the spectral radius under different input statistics, but precise tuning is negatively affected by interneural correlations. Furthermore, flow control showed a consistent task performance over a wide range of input strengths/variances. Variance control, on the other side, did not yield the desired spectral radii with the same precision. Moreover, task performance was less consistent across different input strengths.\n\nGiven the better performance and simpler mathematical form of flow control, we concluded that a local control of the spectral radius via an implicit adaptation scheme is a realistic alternative to approaches using classical \"set point\" homeostatic feedback controls of neural firing.\n\nAuthor summaryHow can a neural network control its recurrent synaptic strengths such that network dynamics are optimal for sequential information processing? An important quantity in this respect, the spectral radius of the recurrent synaptic weight matrix, is a non-local quantity. Therefore, a direct calculation of the spectral radius is not feasible for biological networks. However, we show that there exist a local and biologically plausible adaptation mechanism, flow control, which allows to control the recurrent weight spectral radius while the network is operating under the influence of external inputs. Flow control is based on a theorem of random matrix theory, which is applicable if inter-synaptic correlations are weak. We apply the new adaption rule to echo-state networks having the task to perform a time-delayed XOR operation on random binary input sequences. We find that flow-controlled networks can adapt to a wide range of input strengths while retaining essentially constant task performance.",

    "abstract": "Microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are valuable tools for electrophysiological analysis at a cellular population level, providing assessment of neural network health and development. Analysis can be complex, however, requiring intensive processing of large high-dimensional data sets consisting of many activity parameters. As a result, valuable information is lost, as studies subjectively report relatively few metrics in the interest of simplicity and clarity.\n\nFrom a screening perspective, many groups report simple overall activity; we are more interested in culture health and changes in network connectivity that may not be evident from basic activity parameters. For example, general changes in overall firing rate - the most commonly reported parameter - provide no information on network development or burst character, which could change independently. Our goal was to develop a fast objective process to capture most, if not all, the valuable information gained when using MEAs in neural development and toxicity studies.\n\nWe implemented principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the high dimensionality of MEA data. Upon analysis, we found that the first principal component was strongly correlated to time, representing neural culture development; therefore, factor loadings were used to create a single index score - named neural activity score (NAS) - reflective of neural maturation. To validate this score, we applied it to studies analyzing various treatments. In all cases, NAS accurately recapitulated expected results, suggesting this method is viable. This approach may be improved with larger training data sets and can be shared with other researchers using MEAs to analyze complicated treatment effects and multicellular interactions.\n\nAuthor SummaryAnalyzing neural activity has important applications such as basic neuroscience research, understanding neurological diseases, drug development, and toxicity screening. Technology for recording neural activity continues to develop, producing large data sets that provide complex information about neuronal function. One specific technology, microelectrode arrays (MEAs), has recently given researchers the ability to record developing neural networks with potential to provide valuable insight into developmental processes and pathological conditions. However, the complex data generated by these systems can be challenging to analyze objectively and quantitatively, hindering the potential of MEAs, especially for high-throughput approaches, such as drug development and toxicity screening, which require quick, simple, and accurate quantification. Therefore, we have developed an index for simple quantification and evaluation of neural network maturation and the effects of perturbation. We present validation of our approach using several treatments and culture conditions, as well as a meta-analysis of toxicological screening data to compare our approach to current methods. In addition to providing a simple quantification method for neural network activity in various conditions, our method provides potential for improved results interpretation in toxicity screening and drug development.",

    "abstract": "Bone pathology is frequent in stressed individuals. A comprehensive examination of mechanisms linking life stress, depression and disturbed bone homeostasis is missing. In this translational study, mice exposed to early life stress (MSUS) were examined on bone microarchitecture (CT), metabolism (qPCR), and neuronal stress mediator expression (qPCR) and contrasted with a sample of depressive patients with or without early life stress by analyzing bone mineral density [BMD] (DXA) and metabolic changes in serum (osteocalcin, PINP, CTX-I). MSUS mice showed a significant decrease in NGF, NPYR1, VIPR1 and TACR1 expression, higher innervation density in bone and increased serum levels of CTX-I, suggesting a milieu in favor of catabolic bone turnover. MSUS mice had a significantly lower body weight compared to control mice, and this caused minor effects on bone micro-CT. Depressive patients with experiences of childhood neglect also showed a catabolic pattern. A significant reduction in BMD was observed in depressive patients with childhood abuse and stressful life events during childhood. Therefore, future studies on prevention and treatment strategies for both mental and bone disease should consider early life stress as a risk factor for bone pathologies.",

    "abstract": "Spatial expansion of a population of cells can arise from growth of microorganisms, plant cells, and mammalian cells. It underlies normal or dysfunctional tissue development and it can be exploited as the foundation for programming spatial patterns. This expansion is often driven by continuous growth and division of cells within a colony, which in turn pushes the peripheral cells outward. This process generates a repulsion velocity field at each location within the colony. Here we show that this process can be approximated as coarse-grained repulsive-expansion kinetics. This framework enables accurate and efficient simulation of growth and gene expression dynamics in radially symmetric colonies with homogenous z-directional distribution. It is robust even if cells are not spherical and vary in size. The simplicity of the resulting mathematical framework also greatly facilitates generation of mechanistic insights.",

    "abstract": "Oral-facial-digital syndromes (OFD) are a heterogeneous group of congenital disorders characterized by malformations of the face and oral cavity, and digit anomalies. To date, mutations in 12 ciliary-related genes have been identified that cause several types of OFD, suggesting that OFDs constitute a subgroup of developmental ciliopathies. Through homozygosity mapping and exome sequencing of two families with variable OFD type 2, we identified distinct germline mutations in INTS13, a subunit of the Integrator complex. This 14-component complex associates with RNAPII and can cleave nascent RNA to modulate gene expression. We determined that INTS13 utilizes a discrete domain within its C-terminus to bind the Integrator cleavage module, which is disrupted by the identified germline INTS13 mutations. Depletion of INTS13 disrupts ciliogenesis in human cultured cells and causes dysregulation of a broad collection of ciliary genes. Accordingly, its knockdown in Xenopus embryos lead to motile cilia anomalies. Altogether, we show that mutations in INTS13 cause an autosomal recessive ciliopathy, which reveals key interactions within Integrator components.",

    "abstract": "Sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) contains active ingredients, such as flavonoids, alkaloids and tannins. However, few studies have focused on essential oils from the receptacle of sunflower (SEOs). The chemical composition, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of SEOs were assessed whether SEOs could be used as nature preservatives and medicines. The extraction rate of SEOs was 0.4% by using hydro-distillation and solvent with petroleum ether, which is much higher than that by only using hydro-distillation (0.2%) in the previous study. A total of 81 volatile constituents of SEOs were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main constituents of SEOs were -pinene (31.17%), calamenene (5.66%), -terpineol (4.71%), verbenone (3.15%), kaur-16-ene (2.52%) and terpinolene (1.47%). The antimicrobial activities of SEOs were assessed against three bacteria (E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus) and two fungi (S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans). The MIC of SEOs against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus was 0.2 mg/mL. The MIC of SEOs against S. cerevisiae was 3.2 mg/mL. The MIC of SEOs against E. coli and Candida albicans was 6.4 mg/mL. The results showed that SEOs had high antibacterial and antifungal actions. The antioxidant activity was determined with three different analytical assays (DPPH, ABTS and iron reducing ability). The results of antioxidant activities showed that SEOs had high antioxidant activities. The results proved that SEOs could be used as natural preservatives and medicines, due to its excellent antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.",

Mouth-opening and swallowing were treated as motor tasks, while water-injection as sensory tasks. Phase-amplitude coupling between lower frequency and high {gamma} (HG) band (75-150 Hz) was investigated. An  (10-16 Hz) -HG coupling appeared before motor-related HG power increase (burst), and a {theta} (5-9 Hz) -HG coupling appeared during sensory-related HG burst. The motor- and sensory-related HG amplitude were modulated at the trough of  oscillations and peak of {theta} oscillations, respectively. These contrasting results acquired from the orofacial cortex can help to fully elucidate the sensory-motor function in the brain.",

    "abstract": "The midline thalamus bi-directionally connects the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HC) creating a unique cortico-thalamo-cortico circuit fundamental to memory and executive function. While the anatomical connectivity of midline thalamus has been thoroughly investigated, little is known about its cellular organization within each nucleus. Here we used immunohistological techniques to examine cellular distributions in the midline thalamus based on the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR), and calbindin (CB). We also examined these calcium binding proteins in a population of reuniens cells known to project to both mPFC and HC using a dual fluorescence retrograde adenoassociated virus (AAV) based tracing approach. These dual reuniens mPFC-HC projecting cells, in particular, are thought to be important for synchronizing mPFC and HC activity. First, we confirmed the absence of PV+ neurons in the midline thalamus. Second, we found a common pattern of CR+ and CB+ cells throughout midline thalamus with CR+ cells running along the nearby third ventricle (3V) and penetrating the midline. CB+ cells were consistently more lateral and toward the middle of the dorsal-ventral extent of the midline thalamus. Notably, single-labeled CR+ and CB+ zones were partially overlapping and included dual-labeled CR+/CB+ cells. Within RE, we also observed a CR and CB subzone specific diversity. Interestingly, dual mPFC-HC projecting neurons in RE expressed none of the calcium binding proteins examined, but were contained in nests of CR+ and CB+ cells. Overall, the midline thalamus was well organized into CR+ and CB+ rich zones distributed throughout the region, with dual mPFC-HC projecting cells in reuniens representing a unique cell population. These results provide a cytoarchitectural organization in the midline thalamus based on calcium binding protein expression, and sets the stage for future cell-type specific interrogations of the functional role of these different cell populations in mPFC-HC interactions.",

Injections at C5 led to retrograde labeling of neurons throughout forelimb area of the sensorimotor cortex, the rostral forebrain area (RFA), and a region in the lateral cortex near the barrel field. Injections at L2 led to retrograde labeling of neurons in the posterior sensorimotor cortex (hindlimb area) but not the RFA or lateral cortex. With BDA injections into the main sensorimotor cortex (forelimb region), labeled axons terminated selectively at cervical levels. With BDA injections into caudal sensorimotor cortex (hindlimb region), labeled axons passed through cervical levels without sending collaterals into the gray matter and then elaborated terminal arbors at thoracic-sacral levels. With BDA injections into the RFA and lateral cortex near the barrel field, labeled axons terminated at high cervical levels. Axons from medial sensorimotor cortex terminated primarily in intermediate laminae; Axons from lateral sensorimotor cortex terminated primarily in deep layers of the dorsal horn.

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder affecting over 70 million people worldwide, with a high rate of pharmaco-resistance, diverse comorbidities including progressive cognitive and behavioral disorders, and increased mortality from direct (e.g., Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy [SUDEP], accidents, drowning) or indirect effects of seizures and therapies. Extensive research with animal models and human studies provides limited insights into the mechanisms underlying seizures and epileptogenesis, and these have not translated into significant reductions in pharmaco-resistance, morbidities or mortality. To help define changes in molecular signaling networks associated with epilepsy, we examined the proteome of brain samples from epilepsy and control cases. Label-free quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) was performed on the hippocampal CA1-3 region, frontal cortex, and dentate gyrus microdissected from epilepsy and control cases (n=14/group). Epilepsy cases had significant differences in the expression of 777 proteins in the hippocampal CA1-3 region, 296 proteins in the frontal cortex, and 49 proteins in the dentate gyrus in comparison to control cases. Network analysis showed that proteins involved in protein synthesis, mitochondrial function, G-protein signaling, and synaptic plasticity were particularly altered in epilepsy. While protein differences were most pronounced in the hippocampus, similar changes were observed in other brain regions indicating broad proteomic abnormalities in epilepsy. Among the most significantly altered proteins, G-protein Subunit Beta 1 (GNB1) was one of the most significantly decreased proteins in epilepsy in all regions studied, highlighting the importance of G-protein subunit signaling and G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in epilepsy. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying epilepsy, which may allow for novel targeted therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Cardiomyocytes undergo different metabolic changes during development and differentiation crucial for their maturation and adult function, such as contraction, growth and survival. Alterations of cardiac metabolism have been associated with multiple disease states and pathological hypertrophy. The shift in substrate preference can impair the stress response, but it may also have a role in cell growth and survival. Here, we evaluated the response of cardiomyocytes to the presence of exogenous lactate, an important metabolite for the fetal heart and cardiogenesis. Lactate-exposed mouse primary cardiomyocytes and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes quickly acquired a characteristic dedifferentiated phenotype, with enhanced proliferative capacity as determined by an increased expression of cell cycle (Ki67) and cytokinesis (Aurora-B) effectors. This effect was specific to cardiomyocytes and did not affect other heart cell populations (e.g. cardiac fibroblasts). Nevertheless, cardiac fibroblasts exposed to lactate promoted a pro-regenerative environment through the modulation of the release of cytokines (such as Fas, IL-13 or SDF1a). We characterized lactate-induced cardiomyocyte dedifferentiation through RNA-sequencing and gene expression analysis and identified increased expression of BMP10 (a TGF{beta} family protein involved in embryonic cardiomyocyte proliferation and stemness) and proteins associated to cell fate regulation (LIN28, TCIM) together with downregulation of cardiac maturation genes (GRIK1, DGKK). Bottom-up analysis suggested the phenotype promoted by lactate could be related to the activation of hypoxia signaling pathways. This finding indicated that, indeed, lactate may be a key player of hypoxic regenerative responses in the heart, as it usually accumulates as a result of glycolysis. In addition, ex vivo neonatal heart culture showed prolonged beating function and cardiac tissue integrity when culture media was supplemented with lactate. Thus, we conclude that lactate enhances cardiac proliferation by reprogramming cardiomyocytes towards a dedifferentiated stem cell-like state, supporting the notion that modulation of the metabolic microenvironment might be a powerful novel approach for promoting cardiac regeneration and tissue engineering applications.",

    "abstract": "Many studies speak in favor of a rhythmic mode of listening, by which the encoding of acoustic information is structured by rhythmic neural processes at the time scale of about 1 to 4 Hz. Indeed, psychophysical data suggest that humans sample acoustic information in extended soundscapes not uniformly, but weigh the evidence at different moments for their perceptual decision at the time scale of about 2 Hz. We here test the critical prediction that such rhythmic perceptual sampling is directly related to the state of ongoing brain activity prior to the stimulus. Human participants judged the direction of frequency sweeps in 1.2 s long soundscapes while their EEG was recorded. Computing the perceptual weights attributed to different epochs within these soundscapes contingent on the phase or power of pre-stimulus oscillatory EEG activity revealed a direct link between the 4Hz EEG phase and power prior to the stimulus and the phase of the rhythmic component of these perceptual weights. Hence, the temporal pattern by which the acoustic information is sampled over time for behavior is directly related to pre-stimulus brain activity in the delta/theta band. These results close a gap in the mechanistic picture linking ongoing delta band activity with their role in shaping the segmentation and perceptual influence of subsequent acoustic information.",

    "abstract": "Predominant evidence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the accumulation of excess lipids in the liver. A small group with NAFLD may have a more serious condition named non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). However, there is a lack of investigation of the accumulated lipids with spatial and molecular information. Raman microscopy has the potential to characterize molecular species and structures of lipids based on molecular vibration and can achieve high spatial resolution at the organelle level. We aim to demonstrate the feasibility of Raman microscopy for the investigation of NAFLD based on the molecular features of accumulated lipids. By applying the Raman microscopy to the liver of the NASH model mice, we succeeded in visualizing the distribution of lipid droplets (LDs) in hepatocytes. The detailed analysis of Raman spectra revealed the difference of molecular structural features of the LDs, such as the degree of saturation of lipids in the LDs. We also found that the inhomogeneous distribution of cholesterol in the LDs depending on the histology of lipid accumulation. We visualized and characterized the lipids of NASH model mice by Raman microscopy at organelle level. Our findings demonstrated that the Raman imaging analysis was feasible to characterize the NAFLD in terms of the molecular species and structures of lipids.",
