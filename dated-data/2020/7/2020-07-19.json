    "abstract": "In computer science, reinforcement learning is a powerful framework with which artificial agents can learn to maximize their performance for any given Markov decision process (MDP). Advances over the last decade, in combination with deep neural networks, have enjoyed performance advantages over humans in many difficult task settings. However, such frameworks perform far less favorably when evaluated in their ability to generalize or transfer representations across different tasks. Existing algorithms that facilitate transfer typically are limited to cases in which the transition function or the optimal policy is portable to new contexts, but achieving \"deep transfer\" characteristic of human behavior has been elusive. Such transfer typically requires discovery of abstractions that permit analogical reuse of previously learned representations to superficially distinct tasks. Here, we demonstrate that abstractions that minimize error in predictions of reward outcomes generalize across tasks with different transition and reward functions. Such reward-predictive representations compress the state space of a task into a lower dimensional representation by combining states that are equivalent in terms of both the transition and reward functions. Because only state equivalences are considered, the resulting state representation is not tied to the transition and reward functions themselves and thus generalizes across tasks with different reward and transition functions. These results contrast with those using abstractions that myopically maximize reward in any given MDP and motivate further experiments in humans and animals to investigate if neural and cognitive systems involved in state representation perform abstractions that facilitate such equivalence relations.\n\nAuthor summaryHumans are capable of transferring abstract knowledge from one task to another. For example, in a right-hand-drive country, a driver has to use the right arm to operate the shifter. A driver who learned how to drive in a right-hand-drive country can adapt to operating a left-hand-drive car and use the other arm for shifting instead of re-learning how to drive. Despite the fact that both tasks require different coordination of motor skills, both tasks are the same in an abstract sense: In both tasks, a car is operated and there is the same progression from 1st to 2nd gear and so on. We study distinct algorithms by which a reinforcement learning agent can discover state representations that encode knowledge about a particular task, and evaluate how well they can generalize. Through a sequence of simulation results, we show that state abstractions that minimize errors in prediction about future reward outcomes generalize across tasks, even those that superficially differ in both the goals (rewards) and the transitions from one state to the next. This work motivates biological studies to determine if distinct circuits are adapted to maximize reward vs. to discover useful state representations.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional bursting is a major source of noise in gene expression. The telegraph model of gene expression, whereby transcription switches between \"on\" and \"off\" states, is the dominant model for bursting. Recently it was shown that the telegraph model cannot explain a number of experimental observations from perturbation data. Here we study an alternative model that is consistent with the data and which explicitly describes RNA polymerase recruitment and polymerase pause release, two steps necessary for mRNA production. We derive the exact steady-state distribution of mRNA numbers and an approximate steady-state distribution of protein numbers which are given by generalized hypergeometric functions. The theory is used to calculate the relative sensitivity of the coefficient of variation of mRNA fluctuations for thousands of genes in mouse fibroblasts. This indicates that the size of fluctuations is mostly sensitive to the rate of burst initiation and the mRNA degradation rate. Furthermore we show that (i) the time-dependent distribution of mRNA numbers is accurately approximated by a modified telegraph model with a Michaelis-Menten like dependence of the effective transcription rate on RNA polymerase abundance. (ii) the model predicts that if the polymerase recruitment rate is comparable or less than the pause release rate, then upon gene replication the mean number of RNA per cell remains approximately constant. This gene dosage compensation property has been experimentally observed and cannot be explained by the telegraph model with constant rates.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe random nature of gene expression is well established experimentally. Mathematical modelling provides a means of understanding the factors leading to the observed stochasticity. There is evidence that the classical two-state model of stochastic mRNA dynamics (the telegraph model) cannot describe perturbation experiments and a new model that includes polymerase dynamics has been proposed. In this paper, we present the first detailed study of this model, deriving an exact solution for the mRNA distribution in steady-state conditions, an approximate time-dependent solution and showing the model can explain gene dosage compensation. As well, we use the theory together with transcriptomic data, to deduce which parameters when perturbed lead to a maximal change in the size of mRNA fluctuations.",

However, much is unknown about how selective pressures resulting from nutrient limitation shape microbial coding sequences. Here, we study this  resource-driven selection using metagenomic and single-cell data of marine microbes, alongside environmental measurements. We show that a significant portion of the selection exerted on microbes is explained by the environment and is strongly associated with nitrogen availability. We further demonstrate that this resource conservation optimization is encoded in the structure of the standard genetic code, providing robustness against mutations that increase carbon and nitrogen incorporation into protein sequences. Overall, we demonstrate that nutrient conservation exerts a significant selective pressure on coding sequences and may have even contributed to the evolution of the genetic code.",

    "abstract": "Many biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) require heterologous expression to realize their genetic potential, including silent and metagenomic BGCs. Although the engineered Streptomyces coelicolor M1152 is a widely used host for heterologous expression of BGCs, a systemic understanding of how its genetic modifications affect the metabolism is lacking and limiting further development. We performed a comparative analysis of M1152 and its ancestor M145, connecting information from proteomics, transcriptomics, and cultivation data into a comprehensive picture of the metabolic differences between these strains. Instrumental to this comparison was the application of an improved consensus genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of S. coelicolor. Although many metabolic patterns are retained in M1152, we find that this strain suffers from oxidative stress, possibly caused by increased oxidative metabolism. Furthermore, precursor availability is likely not limiting polyketide production, implying that other strategies could be beneficial for further development of S. coelicolor for heterologous production of novel compounds.",

Such interactions have been shown to regulate essential cellular functions and are associated with multiple complex diseases. Therefore, understanding how these interactions may change across conditions is central in biomedical research. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively-parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) is one of several techniques to detect local changes in epigenomic activity (peaks). However, existing methods for differential peak calling are not optimized for the diversity in ChIP-seq signal profiles, are limited to the analysis of two conditions, or cannot classify specific patterns of differential change when multiple patterns exist. To address these limitations, we present a flexible and efficient method for the detection of differential epigenomic activity across multiple conditions. We utilize data from the ENCODE Consortium and show that the presented method, mixNBHMM, exhibits superior performance to current tools and it is among the fastest algorithms available, while allowing the classification of combinatorial patterns of differential epigenomic activity and the characterization of chromatin regulatory states.",

Our simulation studies show that EM has better clustering performance, measured by Adjusted Rand Index, compared to GD in cases of misspecification, whereas on high dimensional data GD outperforms EM. We observe that both with EM and GD there are many solutions with high likelihood but poor cluster interpretation. To address this problem we design a new penalty term for the likelihood based on the Kullback Leibler divergence between pairs of fitted components. Closed form expressions for the gradients of this penalized likelihood are difficult to derive but AD can be done effortlessly, illustrating the advantage of AD-based optimization. Extensions of this penalty for high dimensional data and for model selection are discussed. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the efficacy of clustering using the proposed penalized likelihood approach.",

    "abstract": "Accurate knowledge of adult human brain volume (BV) is critical for studies of aging- and disease-related brain alterations, and for monitoring the trajectories of neural and cognitive functions in conditions like Alzheimers disease and traumatic brain injury. This scoping meta-analysis aggregates normative reference values for BV and three related volumetrics--gray matter volume (GMV), white matter volume (WMV) and cerebrospinal fluid volume (CSFV)--from typically-aging adults studied cross-sectionally using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Drawing from an aggregate sample of 9,473 adults, this study provides (A) regression coefficients {beta} describing the age-dependent trajectories of volumetric measures by sex within the range from 20 to 70 years based on both linear and quadratic models, and (B) average values for BV, GMV, WMV and CSFV at the representative ages of 20 (young age), 45 (middle age) and 70 (old age). The results provided synthesize [~]20 years of brain volumetrics research and allow one to estimate BV at any age between 20 and 70. Importantly, however, such estimates should be used and interpreted with caution because they depend on MRI hardware specifications (e.g. scanner manufacturer, magnetic field strength), data acquisition parameters (e.g. spatial resolution, weighting), and brain segmentation algorithms. Guidelines are proposed to facilitate future meta- and mega-analyses of brain volumetrics.\n\nDisclosure statementThe author declares that he has no actual or potential conflicts of interest.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between plants and microorganisms strongly affect ecosystem functioning as processes of plant productivity, litter decomposition and nutrient cycling are controlled by both organisms. Though two-sided interactions between plants and microorganisms and between microorganisms and litter decomposition are areas of major scientific research, our understanding of the three-sided interactions of plant-derived carbon flow into the soil microbial community and their follow-on effects on ecosystem processes like litter decomposition and plant nutrient uptake remains limited. Therefore, we performed a greenhouse experiment with two plant communities differing in their ability to associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). By applying a 13CO2 pulse label to the plant communities and adding various 15N labelled substrate types to ingrowth cores, we simultaneously traced the flow of plant-derived carbon into soil microbial communities and the return of mineralized nitrogen back to the plant communities. We observed that net 13C assimilation by the rhizosphere microbial communities and their community composition not only depended on plant-AMF association but also type of substrate being decomposed. AMF-association resulted in lower net 13C investment into the decomposer community than absence of the association for similar 15N uptake. This effect was driven by a reduced carbon flow to fungal and bacterial saprotrophs and a simultaneous increase of carbon flow to AMF. Additionally, in presence of AMF association CN flux also depended on the type of substrate being decomposed. Lower net 13C assimilation was observed for decomposition of plant-derived and microorganism-derived substrates whereas opposite was true for inorganic nitrogen. Interestingly, the decomposer communities assembled in the rhizosphere were structured by both the plant community and substrate amendments which suggests existence of functional overlap between the two soil contexts. Moreover, we present preliminary evidence that AMF association helps plants access nutrients that are locked in bacterial and plant necromass at a lower carbon cost. Therefore, we conclude that a better understanding of ecosystem processes like decomposition can only be achieved when the whole plant-microorganism-litter context is investigated.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe Anopheles gambiae complex is comprised of eight morphologically indistinguishable species and has emerged as a model system for the study of speciation genetics due to the rapid radiation of its member species over the past two million years. Male hybrids between most An. gambiae complex species pairs are sterile, and some genotype combinations in hybrid males cause inviability. We investigated the genetic basis of hybrid male inviability and sterility between An. coluzzii and An. quadriannulatus by measuring segregation distortion and performing a QTL analysis of sterility in a backcross population. Hybrid males were inviable if they inherited the An. coluzzii X chromosome and were homozygous at one or more loci in 18.9 Mb region of chromosome 3. The An. coluzzii X chromosome has a disproportionately large effect on hybrid sterility when introgressed into an An. quadriannulatus genetic background. Additionally, an epistatic interaction between the An. coluzzii X and a 1.12 Mb, pericentric region of the An. quadriannulatus 3L chromosome arm has a statistically significant contribution to the hybrid sterility phenotype. This same epistatic interaction occurs when the An. coluzzii X is introgressed into the genetic background of An. arabiensis, the sister species of An. quadriannulatus, suggesting that this may represent one of the first Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities to evolve early in the radiation of the Anopheles gambiae species complex. We describe the additive effects of each sterility QTL, epistatic interactions between them, and genes within QTL with protein functions related to mating behavior, reproduction, spermatogenesis, and microtubule morphogenesis, whose divergence may contribute to post-zygotic reproductive isolation between An. coluzzii and An. quadriannulatus.",

    "abstract": "We studied journal articles published by researchers at all eight of New Zealand universities in 2017 to determine how many were freely accessible on the web. We wrote software code to harvest data from multiple sources, code that we now share to enable others to reproduce our work on their own sample set. In May 2019, we ran our code to determine which of the 2017 articles were open at that time and by what method; where those articles would have incurred an Article Processing Charge (APC) we calculated the cost if those charges had been paid. Where articles were not freely available we determined whether the policies of publishers in each case would have allowed deposit in a non-commercial repository (Green open access). We also examined citation rates for different types of access. We found that, of our 2017 sample set, about two out of every five articles were freely accessible without payment or subscription (41%). Where research was explicitly said to be funded by New Zealands major research funding agencies, the proportion was slightly higher at 45%. Where open articles would have incurred an APC we estimated an average cost per article of USD1,682 (for publications where all articles require an APC, that is, Gold open access) and USD2,558 (where APC payment is optional, Hybrid open access) at a total estimated cost of USD1.45m. Of the paid options, Gold is by far more common for New Zealand researchers (82% Gold, 18% Hybrid). In terms of citations, our analysis aligned with previous studies that suggest a correlation between publications being freely accessible and, on balance, slightly higher rates of citation. This is not seen across all types of open access, however, with Diamond OA achieving the lowest rates. Where articles were not freely accessible we found that a very large majority of them (88% or 3089 publications) could have been legally deposited in an institutional repository. Similarly, only in a very small number of cases had a version deposited in the repository of a New Zealand university made the difference between the publication being freely accessible or not (125 publications). Given that most New Zealand researchers support research being open, there is clearly a large gap between belief and practice in New Zealands research ecosystem.",

We used mitoribosomes with reduced RNA and increased protein mass from Trypanosoma brucei, to provide insights into the biogenesis of mitoribosomal large subunit. Structural characterisation of a stable assembly intermediate revealed 22 assembly factors, some of which are also encoded in mammalian genomes. The assembly factors form a protein network that spans over 180 [A], shielding the ribosomal RNA surface. The entire central protuberance and L7/L12 stalk are not assembled, and require removal of the factors and remodeling of the mitoribosomal proteins to become functional. The conserved proteins GTPBP7 and mt-EngA are bound together at the subunit interface in proximity to the peptidyl transferase center. A mitochondrial acyl-carrier protein plays a role in docking the L1 stalk which needs to be repositioned during maturation.

    "abstract": "Optogenetic manipulation with single-cell resolution can be achieved by two-photon excitation; however, this frequently requires relatively high laser powers or holographic illumination. Here we developed a practical strategy to improve the efficiency of two-photon stimulation by positioning fluorescent proteins or small fluorescent molecules with high two-photon cross-sections in the vicinity of opsins. This generates a highly localized source of endogenous single-photon illumination that can be tailored to match the optimal opsin absorbance. Through neuronal and vascular stimulation in the live mouse brain, we demonstrate the utility of this technique to achieve more efficient opsin stimulation, without loss of cellular resolution. We also provide a theoretical framework for understanding the potential advantages and constrains of this methodology, with suggestions for future improvements. Altogether, this fluorescence transfer illumination method allows experiments difficult to implement in the live brain such as all-optical neural interrogation and control of regional cerebral blood flow.",

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, post translational regulation of nutrient permeases such as trafficking and turnover are poorly understood. We found that loss of a leucine permease BAP2, but not other permeases lead to severe growth retardation when the carbon source is glucose or galactose but not glycerol and lactate. Leucine prototrophy suppressed the retardation, showing BAP2 and LEU2 are synthetically lethal. We discovered that loss of BUL1, an arrestin involved in trafficking of diverse permeases suppressed this lethality. The suppression required another leucine permease, BAP3.

    "abstract": "BackgroundStandard protocols for Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were adopted and being used in a global scale for surveillance of many bacterial food-borne diseases. Matched PFGE bands are considered regardless of co-migration of different DNA fragments. Molecular epidemiology is turning toward whole genome sequencing (WGS). Although, WGS results can be digested In-silico, PFGE and WGS data are being compared separately. We describe a new image analysis algorithm that enables identification of how many DNA fragments co-migrate during PFGE. We built a database that compare described PFGE results to in-silico obtained digestion models (from WGS). Reliability of the method was assessed in-silico using novel computer simulation approach. From WGS, 1,816 digestion model (DMs) were obtained as recommended by PulseNet international. Simulation codes were designed to predict PFGE profiles when DMs are separated at 5% PFGE resolution in addition to expected co-migration levels.\n\nResultsPFGE simulation has shown that about 35% of DNA fragments co-migrate at 5% PFGE resolution. Similar result was obtained when wet-lab PFGE profiles were analyzed using image analysis algorithm mentioned earlier. When image analysis results were compared to DMs, results returned by geltowgs.uofk.edu database revealed reasonable relatedness to DMs. In terms of number of PFGE typable DNA fragments, 45,517 were typable (representing 46.54% out of 97,801). Previously mentioned typable fragments (in terms of typable sizes) comprised 91.24% of the sum of nucleotides of all chromosomes tested (7.24 billion bp). However, significant variations were shown within and between different digestion protocols.\n\nConclusionsIdentification of co-migration levels will reveal the third dimension of PFGE profiles. This will provide a better way for evaluating isolate relationships. Linking old PFGE results to WGS by means of simulation demonstrated here will provide a chance to link millions of PFGE epidemiological data accumulated during the last 24 years to the new WGS era. Evaluation of population dynamics of pathogenic bacteria will be deeper through space and time. Selection of restriction enzymes for PFGE typing will have a powerful in-silico evaluation tool.",

    "abstract": "The generation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs) is implicated in a plethora of vital cell functions, from mitochondrial quality control to peroxisomal biogenesis. The discovery of distinct subtypes of MDVs has revealed the selective inclusion of mitochondrial cargo in response to varying stimuli. However, the true scope and variety of MDVs is currently unclear, and unbiased approaches have yet to be used to understand their biology. Furthermore, as mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases, it is essential to understand MDV pathways in the nervous system. To address this, we sought to identify the cargo in brain MDVs. We used an in vitro budding assay and proteomic approach to identify proteins selectively enriched in MDVs. 72 proteins were identified as MDV enriched, of which 31% were OXPHOS proteins. Interestingly, the OXPHOS proteins localized to specific modules of the respiratory complexes, hinting at the inclusion of sub-assemblies in MDVs. Small TIM chaperones were also highly enriched in MDVs, linking mitochondrial chaperone-mediated protein transport to MDV formation. As the two Parkinsons disease genes PINK1 and Parkin have been previously implicated in MDV biogenesis in response to oxidative stress, we compared the MDV proteomes from the brains of wild-type mice with those of PINK1-/- and Parkin-/- mice. No significant difference was found, suggesting that PINK1- and Parkin-dependent MDVs make up a small proportion of all MDVs in the brain. Our findings demonstrate a previously uncovered landscape of MDV complexity and provide a foundation from which to discover further novel MDV functions.",

    "abstract": "The overwhelming complexity of microbiomes makes it difficult to decipher functional relationships between specific microbes and ecosystem properties. While machine learning analyses have demonstrated an impressive ability to correlate microbial community composition with macroscopic functions, mechanisms that dictate model predictions are often unknown, and predictions often lack an assigned metric of uncertainty. In this study, we apply Bayesian networks to build on prior feature selection analyses and construct easy-to-interpret probabilistic models, which accurately predict levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the relative abundance of soil bacteria (16S rRNA gene profiles). In addition to standard cross-validation, we show that a Bayesian network model trained using samples from a pine litter decomposition study accurately predicts DOC of samples from an independent oak litter decomposition study, suggesting that mechanisms driving variation in soil carbon storage may be conserved across different types of decomposing plant litter. Furthermore, the structure of the resulting Bayesian network model defines a minimal set of highly informative taxa, whose abundances directly constrain the probability of high or low DOC conditions. Significant accuracy of the Bayesian network model with independent data sets supports the validity of the identified relationships between taxa abundance and DOC.\n\nSummaryUnderstanding the interplay between microbiomes and the environments they inhabit is a daunting task. While recent advances in gene sequencing technology provide a means of profiling the relative abundance of microbial species, the resulting data are noisy, sparse, and limited to small sample sizes. Despite these challenges, machine learning approaches have demonstrated a promising ability to discover patterns linking the microbiome with macroscopic behavior. However, most machine learning models applied to microbiome data do not estimate prediction uncertainty and provide little insight regarding how predictions are made. In this study, we couple machine learning approaches for feature reduction with Bayesian networks to model the relationship between the soil microbiome and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). We show that Bayesian networks are accurate and provide a transparent link between microbial abundance and DOC. To validate Bayesian networks, we demonstrate accurate predictions for held-out testing data and with data from independent decomposition experiments.",

However, how PKG transmits these signals in the absence of known second messenger-dependent calcium channels or scaffolding proteins is unknown. Here we identify a polytopic membrane protein, ICM1, with homology to transporters and calcium channels that is tightly-associated with PKG in both Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood stages and P. berghei gametocytes. Phosphoproteomic analyses in both Plasmodium species reveal multiple ICM1 phosphorylation events dependent upon PKG activity. Stage-specific depletion of P. berghei ICM1 blocks gametogenesis due to the inability of mutant parasites to mobilise intracellular calcium upon PKG activation, whilst conditional loss of P. falciparum ICM1 results in reduced calcium mobilisation, defective egress and lack of invasion. Our findings provide new insights into atypical calcium homeostasis in malaria parasites essential for pathology and disease transmission.",

How do these regions develop during childhood? We used functional MRI to measure longitudinal development of category-selectivity in school-age children over 1 to 5 years. We discovered that from young childhood to the teens, face- and word-selective regions in VTC expand and become more category-selective, but limb-selective regions shrink and lose their preference for limbs. Critically, as a child develops, increases in face- and word-selectivity are directly linked to decreases in limb-selectivity, revealing that during childhood limb-selectivity in VTC is repurposed into word- and face-selectivity. These data provide evidence for cortical recycling during childhood development. This has important implications for understanding typical as well as atypical brain development and necessitates a rethinking of how cortical function develops during childhood.",

However, such theories have been criticized on the grounds that many neuroimaging studies of language processing find similar effects across regions. Moreover, condition by region interaction effects, which provide the strongest evidence of functional differentiation between regions, have rarely been offered in support of these theories. Here we address this by using lesion-symptom mapping in three large, partially-overlapping groups of aphasia patients with left hemisphere brain damage due to stroke (N=121, N=92, N= 218). We identified multiple measure by region interaction effects, associating damage to the posterior middle temporal gyrus with syntactic comprehension deficits, damage to posterior inferior frontal gyrus with expressive agrammatism, and damage to inferior angular gyrus with semantic category word fluency deficits. Our results are inconsistent with recent hypotheses that regions of the language network are undifferentiated with respect to high-level linguistic processing.",

The goal of the present study was to investigate how proprioceptive afferents contribute to effortful perception of heaviness and mass distribution of a manually wielded object in the absence of vision. Blindfolded participants manually wielded a set of specially-designed experimental objects of different mass and mass distribution about the wrist at different wrist angles and wrist angular kinematics. By independently manipulating these variables, we aimed to elicit different levels of tonic and rhythmic activity in the muscle spindles of the wrist flexors and extensors and relate them to reported perceptual judgments of heaviness and length. Perception of heaviness and length were predominantly dependent on an objects static moment and the moment of inertia, respectively. Manipulations of wrist angle and wrist angular kinematics affected perceptual judgments of heaviness and length in relatively opposite ways. As for wrist angle, ulnar deviation consistently resulted in an object being perceived heavier but shorter. Compared to static holding, wielding the object resulted in it being perceived heavier but wielding did not affect perceived length. These results suggest that proprioceptive afferents differentially contribute to effortful perception of object heaviness and mass distribution.",

However, it is unclear how the cellular proteostasis machines have evolved to adjust the protein biogenesis needs to environmental constraints. Herein, we describe a novel computational approach, based on semantic network analysis, to evaluate proteostasis differentiation during evolution. We show that the molecular components of the proteostasis network (PN) are reliable metrics to deconvolute the life forms into Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya and to assess the evolution rates among species. Topological properties of semantic graphs were used as new criteria to evaluate PN complexity of 93 Eukarya, 250 Bacteria and 62 Archaea, thus representing a novel strategy for taxonomic classification. This functional analysis provides information about species divergence and pointed towards taxonomic clades that evolved faster than others. Kingdom-specific PN were identified, suggesting that PN complexity correlates evolution. Through the analysis of gene conservation, we found that the gains or losses that occurred throughout PN evolution revealed a dichotomy within both the PN conserved modules and within kingdom-specific modules. Since the PN is implicated in cell fitness, aging and disease onset, it could be used as a new metric to tackle mechanisms underlying  gain-of-functions, and their biological ramifications.",

Yet, our understanding of the clinical variability remains incomplete. Here, we use biophysical modelling to characterize the dopaminergic landscape in the healthy and denervated striatum. Based on currently proposed mechanisms causing PD, we model three distinct denervation patterns, and show notable differences in the dopaminergic network as denervation progresses. We find local and global differences in the activity of two types of striatal neurons depending on the denervation pattern. Finally, we identify an optimal cellular strategy for maintaining normal dopamine signaling when neurons degenerate stochastically within our model. Our results derive a conceptual framework in which the clinical variability of PD is rooted in distinct denervation patterns and forms testable predictions for future PD research.",

    "abstract": "Poultry originated Escherichia fergusonii (POEF), an emerging bacterial pathogen, causes a wide range of intestinal and extra-intestinal infections in the poultry industry which incurred significant economic losses worldwide. Chromosomal co-existence of antibiotics and metal resistance genes has recently been the focal point of POEF isolates besides its pathogenic potentials. This study reports the complete genome analysis of POEF strain OTSVEF-60 from the poultry originated samples of Bangladesh. The assembled draft genome of the strain was 4.2 Mbp containing 4,503 coding sequences, 120 RNA (rRNA = 34, tRNA = 79, ncRNA = 7), and three intact phage signature regions. Forty one broad range antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including dfrA12, qnrS1, blaTEM-1, aadA2, tet(A) and sul-2 along with multiple efflux pump genes were detected, which translated to phenotypic resistant patterns of the pathogen to trimethoprim, fluoroquinolones, {beta}-lactams, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and sulfonamides. Moreover, 22 metal resistance genes were found co-existing within the genome of the POEF strain, and numerous virulence genes (VGs) coding for cit (AB), feo (AB), fep (ABCG), csg (ABCDEFG), fliC, ompA gadA, ecpD etc were also identified throughout the genome. In addition, we detected a Class I integron gene cassette harboring dfrA12, ant (3'')-I and qacE{Delta}-sul2) genes, 42 copies of insertion sequence (IS) elements, and two CRISPR arrays. The genomic functional analysis revealed overexpression of several metabolic pathways related to motility, flagellar assembly, epithelial cell invasion, quorum sensing, biofilm formation, and biosynthesis of vitamin, co-factors, and secondary metabolites. We herein for the first time detected multiple ARGs, VGs, mobile genetic elements, and some metabolic functional genes in the complete genome of POEF strain OTSVEF-60, which might be associated with the pathogenesis, spreading of ARGs and VGs, and subsequent treatment failure against this emerging avian pathogen with currently available antimicrobials.",

Their work encompassed a widescale analysis of connections reported through tracing between 35 regions in the macaque visual cortex, extending from cortical regions to the laminar level. In this work, we revisit laminar-level connectivity in the macaque brain using a whole-brain MRI-based approach. We use multi-modal ex-vivo MRI imaging of the macaque brain in both white and grey matter, which are then integrated via a simple model of laminar connectivity. This model uses a granularity-based approach to define a set of rules that expands cortical connections to the laminar level. Different fiber tracking routines are then examined in order to explore the ability of our model to infer laminar connectivity. The network of macaque cortical laminar connectivity resulting from the chosen routine is then validated in the visual cortex by comparison to findings from Felleman and Van Essen with an 83% accuracy level. By using a more comprehensive definition of the cortex that addresses its heterogenous laminar composition, we can explore a new avenue of structural connectivity on the laminar level.",

    "abstract": "Standing still and focusing on a visible target in front of us is a preamble to many coordinated behaviors (e.g., reaching an object). Hiding behind its apparent simplicity is a deep layering of texture at many scales. The task of standing still laces together activities at multiple scales: from ensuring that a few photoreceptors on the retina cover the target in the visual field on an extremely fine scale to synergies spanning the limbs and joints at smaller scales to the mechanical layout of the ground underfoot and optic flow in the visual field on the coarser scales. Here, we used multiscale probability density function (PDF) analysis to show that postural fluctuations exhibit similar statistical signatures of cascade dynamics as found in fluid flow. In participants asked to stand quietly, the oculomotor strain of visually fixating at different distances moderated postural cascade dynamics. Visually fixating at a comfortable viewing distance elicited posture with a similar cascade dynamics as posture with eyes closed. Greater viewing distances known to stabilize posture showed more diminished cascade dynamics. In contrast, nearest and farthest viewing distances requiring greater oculomotor strain to focus on targets elicited a dramatic strengthening of postural cascade dynamics, reflecting active postural adjustments. Critically, these findings suggest that vision stabilizes posture by reconfiguring the prestressed poise that prepares the body to interact with different spatial layouts.",

Decades of research have demonstrated that to simplify the dauntingly complex task of interpersonal communication, perceivers use stereotypes and other sources of prior knowledge to predict the responses of individuals in their environment. Here, we show that these top-down expectations can also shape the subjective value of expectation-consistent and expectation-violating targets. Specifically, in two neuroimaging experiments (n = 58), we observed increased activation in brain regions associated with reward processing--including the nucleus accumbens--when perceivers observed information consistent with their social expectations. In two additional behavioral experiments (n = 704), we observed that perceivers were willing to forgo money to encounter an expectation-consistent target and avoid an expectation-violating target. Together, these findings suggest that perceivers value having their social expectations confirmed, much like food or monetary rewards.",

Hence deficits that affect the visual perception may also affect visual mental imagery.\n\nAimWe aimed to study the effect of refractive blur on the vividness of mental imagery.\n\nMethodsSubjects were recruited from volunteers and divided into two groups; individuals with refractive errors-Ametropes(AM), and individuals without refractive errors - Emmetropes(EM). After filling in the Verbalizer-Visualizer-Questionnaire (VVQ), the subjects were asked to perform a mental imagery task with and without refractive blur. The participants were asked to generate a mental image of a specific object initially with eyes closed, eyes open and then with refractive blur in random order, and then judge the vividness of the mental image on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (low vividness) to 5 (good vividness). The EM participants had to wear a + 2D spectacles to produce refractive blur.\n\nResultsA total of 162 participants were recruited to the study. Of these 73 were EM and 89 were AM. Of the AM, 30 had additional astigmatism. The mean VVQ score was 64.9(11.2). The mean refractive error was 1.8(1.3)D. Following the mental imagery task, at baseline with eyes closed, 138 (85.5%)subjects had vivid mental imagery close to visual perception(Likert scale:5). With the opening of the eyes, the vividness dropped by at least 1 point in the Likert scale in 139(85.8%). With the introduction of refractive blur, 153(94.4%) subjects had a drop in the vividness of the image by at least 1 point and 22(13.6%) subjects by at least 2 points.\n\nConclusionIntroduction of refractory blur results in the reduction of the vividness of mental imagery.",

These effects include increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression and anxiety. The mechanisms underlying these late-life neurologic effects are unknown. In this article, we measured changes in the offspring brain and determined which brain regions are sensitive to maternal metabolic milieu and therefore may mediate NDD risk. We showed that mice exposed to maternal high-fat diet display extensive brain changes in adulthood despite being switched to low-fat diet at weaning. Brain regions impacted by early-life diet include the extended amygdalar system, which plays an important role in reward-seeking behaviour. Genes preferentially expressed in these regions have functions related to feeding behavior, while also being implicated in human NDDs, such as autism. Our data demonstrated that exposure to maternal high-fat diet in early-life leads to brain alterations that persist into adulthood, even after dietary modifications.",

For repeatedly encountered environments, learning to switch immediately to prior adaptive states would be beneficial, but past work remains inconclusive. We tested if the visual system can learn such visual mode switching for a strongly tinted environment, where adaptation causes the dominant hue to fade over time. Eleven observers wore red glasses for five one-hour periods per day, for five days. Color adaptation was measured by asking observers to identify \"unique yellow\", appearing neither reddish nor greenish. As expected, the world appeared less and less reddish during the one-hour periods of glasses wear. Critically, across days the world also appeared significantly less reddish immediately after donning the glasses. This indicates that the visual system learned to shift rapidly to a partially adapted state, switching modes to stabilize color vision. Mode switching likely provides a general strategy to optimize perceptual processes.",

Reliability of dynamical systems refers to response to perturbation: A dynamical system is reliable if it behaves predictably following a perturbation. Here, we demonstrate that reliability fails for an archetypal physiological model, the Ultradian glucose-insulin model. Reliability failure arises because of the presence of delay. Using the theory of rank one maps from smooth dynamical systems, we precisely explain the nature of the resulting delay-induced uncertainty (DIU). We develop a recipe one may use to diagnose DIU in a general dynamical system. Guided by this recipe, we analyze DIU emergence first in a classical linear shear flow model and then in the Ultradian model.

Botrytis cinerea, the causal pathogen of grey mould, is a generalist necrotrophic fungus with the ability to infect over 1000 species and influence a broad array of hosts physiological responses. B. cinerea is capable of infecting a wide variety of tissues such as leaves, stem, flowers and fruits that adds to the already complex problem in controlling its spread. Understanding the pathogen induced transcriptional reprogramming in different tissues is important to identify key genes for targeted gene modifications. Identifying the genes that are common between different tissue infections will reveal similarities and differences between these pathogen-tissue pairs. In this study, the transcriptomic datasets of Botrytis infected white berries of Fragaria vesca (WhiteBc) and Botrytis infected red berries of F. vesca (RedBc) were (re)mapped to the latest F. vesca transcriptome to enable direct comparisons with the Botrytis infected F. vesca leaves (LeafBc). The genes involved in MAP kinase signalling, pathogenesis-related, allergens, cell-wall defences, detoxification and secondary metabolites were Common Responsive and Upregulated (CoReUp) between LeafBc, WhiteBc and RedBc, suggesting their important roles against B. cinerea infection in all three tissues.

A longstanding design approach uses genetic fusion to join protein homo-oligomer subunits via -helical linkers to form more complex symmetric assemblies, but this method is hampered by linker flexibility and a dearth of geometric solutions. Here, we describe a general computational method that performs rigid three-body fusion of homo-oligomer and spacer building blocks to generate user-defined architectures, while at the same time significantly increasing the number of geometric solutions over typical symmetric fusion. The fusion junctions are then optimized using Rosetta to minimize flexibility. We apply this method to design and test 92 dihedral symmetric protein assemblies from a set of designed homo-dimers and repeat protein building blocks. Experimental validation by native mass spectrometry, small angle X-ray scattering, and negative-stain single-particle electron microscopy confirms the assembly states for 11 designs. Most of these assemblies are constructed from DARPins (designed ankyrin repeat proteins), anchored on one end by -helical fusion and on the other by a designed homo-dimer interface, and we explored their use for cryo-EM structure determination by incorporating DARPin variants selected to bind targets of interest. Although the target resolution was limited by preferred orientation effects, small scaffold size, and the low-order symmetry of these dihedral scaffolds, we found that the dual anchoring strategy reduced the flexibility of the target-DARPIN complex with respect to the overall assembly, suggesting that multipoint anchoring of binding domains could contribute to cryo-EM structure determination of small proteins.",

    "abstract": "When thrombus fractures and breaks off it can occlude vital vessels such as those of the heart, lung, or brain. These thromboembolic conditions are responsible for 1 in 4 deaths world-wide. This problem is also of significant current interest as 1 in 3 COVID-19 intensive care patients exhibit thromboembolic complications. Thrombus resistance to fracture is driven by its intrinsic fracture toughness as well as other, non-surface-creating dissipative mechanisms. In our current work, we identify and quantify these latter mechanisms toward future studies that aim to delineate fracture from other forms of dissipation. To this end, we use an in vitro thrombus mimic system to produce whole blood clots and explore their dissipative mechanics under simple uniaxial extension, cyclic loading, and stress-relaxation. We found that whole blood clots exhibit Mullins effect, hysteresis, permanent set, strain-rate dependence, and nonlinear stress-relaxation. Interestingly, we found that performing these tests under dry or submerged conditions did not change our results. However, performing these tests under room temperature or body temperature conditions yielded differences. Overall, we have demonstrated that whole blood clots show several dissipative phenomena - similarly to hydrogels - that will be critical to our understanding of thrombus fracture.",

    "abstract": "Clathrin mediated endocytosis is the primary pathway for receptor and cargo internalization in eukaryotic cells. It is characterized by a polyhedral clathrin lattice that coats budding membranes. The mechanism and control of lattice assembly, curvature, and vesicle formation at the plasma membrane has been a matter of longstanding debate. Here, we use platinum replica and cryo electron microscopy and tomography to present a global structural framework of the pathway. We determine the shape and size parameters common to clathrin-mediated endocytosis. We show that clathrin sites maintain a constant surface area during curvature across multiple cell lines. Flat clathrin is present in all cells and spontaneously curves into coated pits without additional energy sources or recruited factors. Finally, we attribute curvature generation to loosely connected and pentagon-containing flat lattices that can rapidly curve when a flattening force is released. Together, these data present a new universal mechanistic model of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",

    "abstract": "The concept of environmental DNA (eDNA) utilizes nucleic acids of organisms directly from the environment. Recent breakthrough studies have successfully detected a wide spectrum of prokaryotic and eukaryotic eDNA from a variety of environments, ranging from ancient to modern, and from terrestrial to aquatic. These numerous sources promise to establish eDNA as a tool for diverse scientific settings. Here, we propose and establish spider webs as a source of eDNA with far reaching implications. First, we conducted a field study to track specific arthropod targets from different spider webs. We then employed high-throughput amplicon sequencing of taxonomic barcodes to investigate the utility of spider web eDNA for biodiversity monitoring of animals, fungi and bacteria. Our results show that genetic remains on spider webs allow the detection of even the smallest target organisms. We also demonstrate that eDNA from spider webs is useful in research of community compositions in different domains of life, with potentially highly detailed temporal and spatial information.",

    "abstract": "U12-type or minor introns are found in most multicellular eukaryotes and constitute [~]0.5% of all introns in species with a minor spliceosome. Although the biological significance for evolutionary conservation of U12-type introns is debated, mutations disrupting U12 splicing cause developmental defects in both plants and animals. In human hematopoietic stem cells, U12 splicing defects disrupt proper differentiation of myeloid lineages and are associated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), predisposing individuals to acute myeloid leukemia. Mutants in the maize ortholog of RNA Binding Motif Protein48 (RBM48) have aberrant U12-type intron splicing. Human RBM48 was recently purified biochemically as part of the minor spliceosome and shown to recognize the 5 end of the U6atac snRNA. In this report, we use CRISPR/Cas9-mediated ablation of RBM48 in human K-562 cells to show the genetic function of RBM48. RNA-seq analysis comparing wild-type and mutant K-562 genotypes found that 48% of minor intron containing genes (MIGs) have significant U12-type intron retention in RBM48 mutants. Comparing these results to maize rbm48 mutants defined a subset of MIGs disrupted in both species. Mutations in the majority of these orthologous MIGs have been reported to cause developmental defects in both plants and animals. Our results provide genetic evidence that the primary defect of human RBM48 mutants is aberrant U12-type intron splicing, while a comparison of human and maize RNA-seq data identifies candidate genes likely to mediate mutant phenotypes of U12-type splicing defects.",

    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, numerous examples have been described where a trait that was once lost during the course of evolution had been regained. Here, we argue that such reverse evolution can also become apparent when trait expression is plastic in response to the environment. We tested this hypothesis for the loss and regain of fat synthesis in parasitic wasps. Wasps from lineages that supposedly regained lipogenic ability ~80 million years ago were grown under a fat-poor or fat-rich environment. In line with our hypothesis, it turned out that fat synthesis had not been lost and regained, but was only switched on in low-fat environments. Functional protein domains of key lipogenesis genes were also found in other parasitoid species, suggesting that plasticity of fat synthesis may be more widespread in parasitoids. Individual-based simulations then revealed that a switch for plastic expression can remain functional in the genome for thousands of generations, even if it is only used sporadically. The evolution of plasticity may thus also explain other examples of apparent reverse evolution.",

    "abstract": "Proteins encoded by plant resistance genes (R genes) detect pathogenic effectors and initiate immune responses. Although R genes in many plant genomes are identified, they are yet to be identified in wheat. The major objectives of this project were to conduct genome-wide identification of the NB-ARC-encoding R genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and assess their genomic architecture and potential functional divergence. Wheat protein sequences were obtained from the Ensembl Genomes database, and genes were identified using interpro program. Chromosomal locations of the R genes were determined and syntenic analyses were performed. Altogether, 2151 wheat NB-ARC-encoding genes were identified, among which 1298 genes formed 547 gene clusters. Many of these gene clusters included highly similar genes likely formed by tandem duplications. Among the NB-ARC-encoding genes, 1552 ([~]72%) encode Leucine-Rich Repeats (LRRs), 802 are Coiled-Coil (CC) domain-encoding CC-NBS-LRR (CNL) genes and three are Resistance to Powdery mildew 8 (RPW8) domain-encoding RPW8-NBS-LRR (RNL) genes. Surprisingly, five of the NB-ARC-encoding genes encoded a Toll/Interleukin-1 Receptor (TIR), with no LRR, known as TN genes. CNL clades formed similar nesting patterns with a large expansion of CNL-C group like previously reported findings in wheat relatives. Comparisons of the wheat genome with barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and Tauschs goatgrass (Aegilops tauschii Coss.), showed similar locations for homologous NB-ARC-encoding genes. These results showed that R genes in wheat have diversified through duplication to encode receptors that recognize rapidly evolving pathogenic effectors. Identified R genes in this study have implications in plant breeding, as a source of resistance for crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "Re-exposure to a cocaine-associated context triggers craving and relapse through the retrieval of salient context-drug memories. Upon retrieval, context-drug memories become labile and temporarily sensitive to modification before they are reconsolidated into long-term memory stores. Cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) signaling is necessary for cocaine-memory reconsolidation and associated glutamatergic plasticity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA); however, it remains unclear whether CB1Rs in the BLA mediate this phenomenon. To investigate this question, we examined whether CB1R antagonist or agonist administration into the BLA immediately after cocaine-memory retrieval (i.e., during memory reconsolidation) alters cocaine-memory strength and subsequent drug context-induced cocaine-seeking behavior in an instrumental rodent model of cocaine relapse. Intra-BLA administration of the CB1R antagonist, AM251 (0.3 {micro}g/hemisphere) - during, but not after, memory reconsolidation - increased drug context-induced cocaine-seeking behavior three days later, while the CB1R agonist, WIN55,212-2 (0.5 {micro}g/hemisphere) failed to alter this behavior. Furthermore, AM251 administration into the posterior caudate putamen (anatomical control region) during memory reconsolidation did not alter subsequent context-induced cocaine-seeking behavior. In a follow-up experiment, cocaine-memory retrieval elicited robust hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, as indicated by an increase in blood serum corticosterone concentration, and this response was selectively extended by intra-BLA AM251 administration during the putative time of memory reconsolidation relative to all control conditions. Together, these findings suggest that CB1R populations in the BLA gate memory strength or interfere with memory maintenance, possibly by diminishing the impact of cue-induced arousal on the integrity of the reconsolidating memory trace or on the efficiency of the memory reconsolidation process.",

Clusters containing Slc12a3+/Pvalb+ and Slc12a3+/Pvalb- cells were identified as DCT1 and DCT2 cells. The DCT1 cells appear to be heterogeneously associated with variable expression of Slc8a1, Calb1, and Ckb among other mRNAs. No DCT2-specific transcripts were found. The analysis also identified two distinct cell types in the Slc12a1+ portion of Henles loop as well as Nos1+/Avpr1a+ macula densa cells. Thus, we identify unexpected cell diversity in the intermediate region of the nephron and create a web-based data resource for these cells.",

    "abstract": "Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism affect 300,000-600,000 patients each year in the US. The progression from deep vein thrombus to pulmonary embolism occurs when blood clots, as a whole or partially, break off from the deep veins and eventually occlude the pulmonary arteries. Venous thromboembolism is the cause of up to 100,000 deaths per year in the US alone. To date, we dont fully understand this mechanical process among other reasons because in-vivo samples are difficult to obtain, highly heterogeneous, and their shapes are inappropriate for most mechanical tests. Toward overcoming these obstacles, we have set out to develop an in-vitro thrombus mimic and to test this mimic under large deformation simple shear. In addition to reporting on the mechanics of our mimics under simple shear, we explore the sensitivity of their mechanics to coagulation conditions and blood storage time, and compare three hyperelastic material models for their ability to fit our data. We found that thrombus mimics made from whole blood demonstrate strain-stiffening, a negative Poynting effect, and hysteresis when tested quasi-statically to 50% strain under simple shear. Additionally, we found that the stiffness of these mimics does not significantly vary with coagulation conditions or blood storage times. Of the three hyperelastic constitutive models that we tested, the Ogden model provided the best fits to both shear stress and normal stress. In conclusion, we developed a robust protocol to generate regularly-shaped, homogeneous thrombus mimics that lend themselves to simple shear testing under large deformation. Future studies will extend our model to include the effect of maturation and explore its fracture properties toward a better understanding of embolization.",

Here we show that 4% of genes in the barnacle genome experience balancing selection across the entire range of the species. Many of these genes harbor mutations maintained across 2 million years of evolution between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. These genes are involved in ion regulation, pain reception, and heat tolerance, functions which are essential in highly variable ecosystems. The data also reveal complex population structure within and between basins, driven by the trans-Arctic interchange and the last glaciation. Divergence between Atlantic and Pacific populations is high, foreshadowing the onset of allopatric speciation, and suggesting that balancing selection is strong enough to maintain functional variation for millions of years in the face of complex demography.",

As a consequence, workers were able to evolve highly specialized morphologies for foraging and colony maintenance, whereas the reproductive caste became specialized for reproduction. Despite these important changes, little is known about general patterns of morphological evolution within the ant reproductive caste. Our goals were to characterize morphological variation in the ant reproductive caste and to test whether different sexes display variation in their evolutionary rates. We obtained measurements of 897 specimens from a total of 678 ant species. The shapes of the size distributions were similar between sexes, with queens being larger than males in all traits except for eye length. Contrary to the expectation based on Renschs rule, although queens were larger, the degree of dimorphism increased with body size. Finally, there is strong evidence for an accelerated tempo of morphological evolution in queens in relation to males. These results represent the first comprehensive treatment of morphological variation in the ant reproductive caste and provide important new insights into their evolution.",

    "abstract": "Humic acids (HAs) stimulate the growth of several plant species by regulating their hormonal and redox metabolisms. Nevertheless, studies on the relationship of these substances with the plant-associated microbiota are almost nonexistent. Here, we hypothesized that the effect of HAs occurs in parallel with the regulation of the plant-associated bacterial community. Our results show the positive influence of HAs on the growth of rice and its stimulation of the root system. Metataxonomics revealed that the structure and composition of root bacterial communities were affected upon the application of HAs. Chitinophaga and Mucilaginibacter were the predominant genera in HA-treated roots. These bacteria produce enzymes that degrade compounds like those present in the wall of fungi, oomycetes, and nematode eggs. Pseudomonas and the Gp 1 group of Acidobacteria, both siderophore-producers and plant-growth promoters were also enriched, although with lower abundances. Given these results, we suggest that plants recruit these microorganisms in response to the stress caused by the HA-root interaction. For the first time, our findings indicate that HA-stimulated plants adopt the ecological strategy of recruiting members of the bacterial community that are candidates for the suppression of pathogens and, therefore, involved in plant defense.",

    "abstract": "Human{gamma} D (H{gamma}D) and{gamma} C (H{gamma}C) are double domained crystallin (Crys) proteins expressed in the nucleus of the eye lens. Structural perturbations in the protein often trigger aggregation, which eventually leads to cataract. To decipher the underlying molecular mechanism, it is important to characterize the partially unfolded conformations of Crys proteins. Using coarse grained protein models and molecular dynamics simulations, we studied the role of on-pathway folding intermediates in the early stages of aggregation. The multi-dimensional free energy surface revealed at least three different folding pathways with the population of partially structured intermediates. The two dominant pathways confirm sequential folding of the N-terminal [Ntd] and the C-terminal domains [Ctd], while the third, least favored pathway involves intermediates where both the domains are partially folded. A native like intermediate (I*), featuring the folded domains and disrupted inter domain contacts, gets populated in all the three pathways. I* forms domain swapped dimers by swapping the entire Ntds and Ctds with other monomers. Population of such oligomers can explain the increased resistance to unfolding resulting in hysteresis observed in the folding experiments of H{gamma}D Crys. An ensemble of double domain swapped dimers are also formed during refolding, where intermediates consisting of partially folded Ntds and Ctds swap secondary structures with other monomers. The double domain swapping model presented in our study provides structural insights into the early events of aggregation in Crys proteins and identifies the key secondary structural swapping elements, where introducing mutations will aid in regulating the overall aggregation propensity.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/210443v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd37e6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@60e7cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@128386org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@178f240_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract figure\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Plant secretome studies have shown the importance of plant defense proteins in the vascular system against pathogens. Studies on Pierces disease of grapevines caused by the xylem-limited bacteria Xylella fastidiosa (Xf) have detected proteins and pathways associated to its pathobiology. Despite the biological importance of the secreted proteins in the extracellular space to plant survival and development, proteome studies are scarce due to technical and technological challenges. Deep learning neural network prediction methods can provide powerful tools for improving proteome profiling by data-independent acquisition (DIA). We aimed to explore the potential of this strategy by combining it with in silico spectral library prediction tool, Prosit, to analyze the proteome of vascular leaf sap of grapevines with Pierces disease. The results demonstrate that the combination of DIA and Prosit increased the total number of identified proteins from 145 to 360 for grapevines and 18 to 90 for Xf. The new proteins increased the range of molecular weight, assisted on the identification of more exclusive peptides per protein, and increased the identification of low abundance proteins. These increases allowed the identification of new functional pathways associated with cellular responses to oxidative stress to be further investigated.",

There is increasing evidence that recombinant, soluble VEGF receptor domains interfering with VEGF signaling may inhibit in vivo neoangiogenesis, tumor growth and metastatic spread. We hypothesized that a soluble form of FLT-1 receptor (sFLT-1) could inhibit the growth of pre-established tumors via an anti-angiogenic mechanism. A replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad) vector carrying the sflt-1 cDNA (Adsflt) was used to overexpress the sFLT-1 receptor in a breast cancer animal model. MCF-7 cells, which produce VEGF, were used to establish solid tumors in the mammary fat pads of female nude mice. After six weeks tumors were injected either with Adsflt, or a negative control virus (AdCMV.{beta}gal). After six months, average tumor volume in the Adsflt-infected group (33 {+/-} 22 mm3) was decreased by 91% relative to that of the negative control group (388 {+/-} 94 mm3; P<0.05). Moreover, 10 of 15 Adsflt-infected tumors exhibited complete regression. The vascular density in Adsflt-infected tumors was reduced by 50% relative to that of negative controls (P<0.05), consistent with sFLT-1-mediated tumor regression through an anti-angiogenic mechanism. Moreover, cell necrosis and fibrosis associated with long-term regression of Adsflt-infected tumors were preceded by apoptosis of tumor vascular endothelial cells. Mice treated with Adsflt intratumorally showed no delay in the healing of cutaneous wounds, providing preliminary evidence that Ad-mediated sFLT-1 overexpression may be an effective anti-angiogenic therapy for cancer without the risk of systemic anti-angiogenic effects.",

    "abstract": "Habitat disturbance is one of the major causes of seagrass loss around the Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean bioregion. Assessing the seagrass response to these disturbances is of utmost importance in planning effective conservation measures. Here we report about seagrass reproductive effort (RE) as an indicator to assess seagrass response to habitat disturbances. Quadrat sampling was used to collect seagrass samples at three locations (a disturbed and undisturbed site per location) of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The health of seagrass meadows was quantified based on density-biomass indices of the disturbed sites. A change ratio (D/U) was derived by contrasting the RE of disturbed (D) sites with the undisturbed (U) sites of all three locations. The relationship between RE and plant morphometrics were also quantified. Reproductive density of T. hemprichii was higher and significant at the three disturbed sites. The average reproductive density of T. hemprichii at the disturbed sites was 3.3-fold higher than the undisturbed sites. The reproductive density consisted around 52% of the total shoot density of T. hemprichii at the disturbed sites. In general, the increase in the plant RE was site-specific and was 4-fold higher at the three disturbed sites. Positive and significant correlations was observed between the change ratio of RE and the plant morphometrics, suggesting an active participation of seagrass morphometrics in the reproductive process. Increase in seagrass RE can contribute to the increase in population genetic diversity, meadow maintenance and various ecosystem functions under the influence of anthropogenic disturbance scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Despite an excellent track record, microbial drug discovery suffers from high rates of re-discovery. Better workflows for the rapid investigation of complex extracts are needed to increase throughput and allow early prioritization of samples. In addition, systematic characterization of poorly explored strains is seldomly performed. Here, we report a metabolomic study of 72 isolates belonging to the rare actinomycete genus Planomonospora, using a workflow of open access tools to investigate its secondary metabolites. The results reveal a correlation of chemical diversity and strain phylogeny, with classes of metabolites exclusive to certain phylogroups. We were able to identify previously reported Planomonospora metabolites, including the ureylene-containing oligopeptide antipain, the thiopeptide siomycin including new congeners and the ribosomally synthesized peptides sphaericin and lantibiotic 97518. In addition, we found that Planomonospora strains can produce the siderophore desferrioxamine or a salinichelin-like peptide. Analysis of the genomes of three newly sequenced strains led to the detection of 47 gene cluster families, of which several were connected to products found by LC-MS/MS profiling. This study demonstrates the value of metabolomic studies to investigate poorly explored taxa and provides a first picture of the biosynthetic capabilities of the genus Planomonospora.",

We report that human EMREOs carry information about both horizontal and vertical eye displacement as well as initial/final eye position. We conclude that all of the information necessary to contribute to a suitable coordinate transformation of auditory spatial cues into a common reference frame with visual information is present in this signal. We hypothesize that the underlying mechanism causing EMREOs could impose a transfer function on any incoming sound signal, which could permit subsequent processing stages to compute the positions of sounds in relation to the visual scene.",

    "abstract": "To thrive, organisms must maintain physiological and environmental variables in optimal ranges. However, in a dynamic world, the optimal range of a variable might fluctuate depending on the organisms state or environmental conditions. Given these fluctuations, how do biological control systems maintain optimal control of physiological and environmental variables? We explored this question by studying the phototactic behavior of larval zebrafish. We demonstrate, with behavioral experiments and computational modeling, that larval zebrafish use phototaxis to maintain environmental luminance at a set point that depends on luminance history. We further show that fish compute this set point using information from both eyes, and that the set point fluctuates on a timescale of seconds when environmental luminance changes. These results expand on previous studies, where phototaxis was found to be primarily positive, and suggest that larval zebrafish, rather than consistently turning towards the brighter areas, exert homeostatic control over the luminance of their surroundings. Furthermore, we show that fluctuations in the surrounding luminance feed back on the system to drive allostatic changes to the luminance set point. Our work has uncovered a novel principle underlying phototaxis in larval zebrafish and characterized a behavioral algorithm by which larval zebrafish exert control over a sensory variable.",

In addition, several aspects of this study are unique, including the comparison of linear and non-linear template generation, the characterization of a large and homogeneous cohort, an analysis of effective resolution after averaging, and the evaluation of potential within template bias as well as a comparison with a template from another minipig species using a \"left-out\" validation set. We found that within our highly homogeneous co-hort, non-linear registration produced better templates, but only marginally so. Although our T1-weighted data were resolution limited, we preserved effective resolution across the multi-subject average, produced templates that have high gray-white matter contrast, and demonstrated superior registration accuracy compared to the only known alternative minipig template.",

Overall accuracy predictions for X-ray and cryoEM structures in the PDB correlate with their resolution, and the network should be broadly useful for assessing the accuracy of both predicted structure models and experimentally determined structures and identifying specific regions likely to be in error. Incorporation of the accuracy predictions at multiple stages in the Rosetta refinement protocol considerably increased the accuracy of the resulting protein structure models, illustrating how deep learning can improve search for global energy minima of biomolecules.",

    "abstract": "Visually guided postural control emerges in response to task constraints. Task constraints generate physiological fluctuations that foster the exploration of available sensory information at many scales. Temporally correlated fluctuations quantified using fractal and multifractal metrics have been shown to carry perceptual information across the body. The risk of temporally correlated fluctuations is that stable sway appears to depend on a healthy balance of standard deviation (SD): too much or too little SD entails destabilization of posture. This study presses on the visual guidance of posture by prompting participants to quietly stand and fixate at distances within, less than, and beyond comfortable viewing distance. Manipulations of the visual precision demands associated with fixating nearer and farther than comfortable viewing distance reveals an adaptive relationship between SD and temporal correlations in postural fluctuations. Changing the viewing distance of the fixation target shows that increases in temporal correlations and SD predict subsequent reductions in each other. These findings indicate that the balance of SD within stable bounds may depend on a tendency for temporal correlations to self-correct across time. Notably, these relationships became stronger with greater distance from the most comfortable viewing and reaching distance, suggesting that this self-correcting relationship allows the visual layout to press the postural system into a poise for engaging with objects and events. Incorporating multifractal analysis showed that all effects attributable to monofractal evidence were better attributed to multifractal evidence of nonlinear interactions across scales. These results offer a glimpse of how current nonlinear dynamical models of self-correction may play out in biological goal-oriented behavior. We interpret these findings as part of the growing evidence that multifractal nonlinearity is a modeling strategy that resonates strongly with ecological-psychological approaches to perception and action.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTVaccine and antiviral development against SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19 disease currently lacks a validated small animal model. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) by the human cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18 hACE2) represent a susceptible rodent model. K18 hACE2-transgenic mice succumbed to SARS-CoV-2 infection by day 6, with virus detected in lung airway epithelium and brain. K18 ACE2-transgenic mice produced a modest TH1/2/17 cytokine storm in the lung and spleen that peaked by day 2, and an extended chemokine storm that was detected in both lungs and brain. This chemokine storm was also detected in the brain at day 4. K18 hACE2-transgenic mice are, therefore, highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and represent a suitable animal model for the study of viral pathogenesis, and for identification and characterization of vaccines (prophylactic) and antivirals (therapeutics) for SARS-CoV-2 infection and associated severe COVID-19 disease.",

    "abstract": "Prior information about distractor facilitates selective attention to task-relevant items and helps the optimization of oculomotor planning. Particularly, feature-based attentional inhibition could be benefited from the pre-knowledge of critical features of the distractors. In the present study, we capitalized on gaze-position decoding to examine the dynamics of attentional deployment in a feature-based attentional task that involved two groups of dots (target/distractor dots) moving toward different directions. Specifically, this measurement revealed how pre-knowledge of the targets or distractors direction modulated real-time feature-based attentional bias. In Experiment 1, participants were provided with target cues indicating the moving direction of target dots. The results showed that participants were biased towards the cued direction and tracked the target dots throughout the task period. In Experiment 2 and Experiment 3, participants were provided with cues that informed the moving direction of distractor dots. The results showed that participants would continuously monitor the distractors direction when the distractor cue varied on a trial-by-trial basis (Experiment 2). However, when the to-be-ignored distractor direction remained constant (Experiment 3), participants would strategically bias their attention to the distractors direction before the cue onset and reduce the cost of re-deployment of attention between trials. These results suggest that monitoring the distractors feature is a prerequisite for feature-based attentional inhibition and this process is facilitated by the predictability of the distractors feature.",

    "abstract": "Pro-inflammatory immune responses are necessary for effective pathogen clearance, but cause severe tissue damage if not shut down in a timely manner1,2. Excessive complement and IFN-{gamma}-associated responses are known drivers of immunopathogenesis3 and are among the most highly induced immune programs in hyper-inflammatory SARS-CoV2 lung infection4. The molecular mechanisms that govern orderly shutdown and retraction of these responses remain poorly understood. Here, we show that complement triggers contraction of IFN-{gamma} producing CD4+ T helper (Th) 1 cell responses by inducing expression of the vitamin D (VitD) receptor (VDR) and CYP27B1, the enzyme that activates VitD, permitting T cells to both activate and respond to VitD. VitD then initiates the transition from pro-inflammatory IFN-{gamma}+ Th1 cells to suppressive IL-10+ Th1 cells. This process is primed by dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape of CD4+ T cells, generating superenhancers and recruiting c-JUN and BACH2, a key immunoregulatory transcription factor5-7. Accordingly, cells in psoriatic skin treated with VitD increased BACH2 expression, and BACH2 haplo-insufficient CD4+ T cells were defective in IL-10 production. As proof-of-concept, we show that CD4+ T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with COVID-19 are Th1-skewed and that VDR is among the top regulators of genes induced by SARS-CoV2. Importantly, genes normally down-regulated by VitD were de-repressed in CD4+ BALF T cells of COVID-19, indicating that the VitD-driven shutdown program is impaired in this setting. The active metabolite of VitD, alfacalcidol, and cortico-steroids were among the top predicted pharmaceuticals that could normalize SARS-CoV2 induced genes. These data indicate that adjunct therapy with VitD in the context of other immunomodulatory drugs may be a beneficial strategy to dampen hyperinflammation in severe COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The skin and its microbiome are the first lines of defense against environmental stressors and pathogens. The symbiotic relationships between the host and the microbiome and within the microbiome are critical to host health. In frogs, this research area is lacking especially in the context of their skin infection with Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis. B. dendrobatidis is a major fungal skin pathogen to amphibians that has caused the extinction of hundreds of amphibian species populations. While some frog species are known susceptible to B. dendrobatidis infections, and others are resistant, we hypothesized that the skin microbiome of frogs plays a role in the prevention of B. dendrobatidis infections that is yet unknown. Therefore, in this work we have examined the bacterial and fungal skin microbiome of one species that is sensitive to B. dendrobatidis infections, Anaxyrus boreas (formerly: Bufo boreas), and the resistant species, Xenopus laevis and Rhinella marina (formerly: Bufo marinus). This was accomplished using tag-encoded FLX amplicon pyrosequencing (bTEFAP) of the 16S rRNA and ITS DNA regions. Our results showed that the bacterial and fungal skin microbiome of A. boreas and R. marina were more similar than to that of X. laevis. We found distinct patterns between the skin microbiome of B. dendrobatidis sensitive and resistant frog species. For the bacterial microbiome, the most abundant bacterial genus observed in all frog samples was Microbacterium. The resistant species had higher abundance in the genera Pseudomonas, Sphingobium, Pedobacter, Variovorax, Morganella, Sphingomonas, Giesbergeria, and Agromyces. In contrast, they had lower abundance of Elizabethkingia (formerly: Flavobacterium), Enterobacter, Ochrobactrum, Arthobacter, Stenotrophomonas, Shinella, Klebsiella, Aeromonas, Comomonas, Chitinophaga, and Rhodococcus. Regarding the fungal microbiome, the resistant species showed higher abundance in the genera Aspergillus, Cladosporium, Elaphomyces, Monascus, Tritirachium, Ceratostomella, and Claviceps, while Asterotremella, Trichosporon, and Malasezzia genera were less represented in resistant species. We have also observed that in the resistant species, the skin microbiome had higher diversity in the fungal microbiota, but not in the bacterial microbiota. We speculate that those observed differences have implications in B. dendrobatidis susceptibility that are yet to be determined, possibly through competition for nutrients or the production of specific anti-fungal molecules.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "In the MAPK pathway, an oncogenic V600E mutation in B-Raf kinase causes the enzyme to be constitutively active, leading to aberrantly high phosphorylation levels of its downstream effectors, MEK and ERK kinases. The V600E mutation in B-Raf accounts for more than half of all melanomas and [~]3% of all cancers and many drugs target the ATP-binding site of the enzyme for its inhibition. Since B-Raf can develop resistance against these drugs and such drugs can induce paradoxical activation, drugs that target allosteric sites are needed. To identify other potential drug targets, we generated and kinetically characterized an active form of B-RafV600E expressed using a bacterial expression system. In doing so, we identified an alpha helix on B-Raf, found at the B-Raf-MEK interface, that is critical for their interaction and the oncogenic activity of B-RafV600E. We performed binding experiments between B-Raf mutants and MEK using pull downs and biolayer interferometry, and assessed phosphorylation levels of MEK in vitro and in cells as well as its downstream target ERK to show that mutating certain residues on this alpha helix is detrimental to binding and downstream activity. Our results suggest that this B-Raf alpha helix binding site on MEK could be a site to target for drug development to treat B-RafV600E-induced melanomas.",

    "abstract": "Induction of necroptosis by mammalian reovirus requires both type I interferon (IFN)-signaling and viral replication events that lead to production of progeny genomic dsRNA. The reovirus outer capsid protein {micro}1 negatively regulates reovirus-induced necroptosis by limiting RNA synthesis. To determine if the outer capsid protein {sigma}3, which interacts with {micro}1, also functions in regulating cell death, we used siRNA-mediated knockdown. Similar to that observed by diminishment of {micro}1 expression, knockdown of newly synthesized {sigma}3 enhances necroptosis. {sigma}3 knockdown does not impact reovirus RNA synthesis. Instead, this increase in necroptosis following {sigma}3 knockdown is accompanied by an increase in IFN production. Furthermore, ectopic expression of {sigma}3 is sufficient to block IFN expression following infection. Surprisingly, the capacity of {sigma}3 protein to bind dsRNA does not impact its capacity to diminish production of IFN. Consistent with this, infection with a virus harboring a mutation in the dsRNA binding domain of {sigma}3 does not result in enhanced production of IFN or cell death. Together, these data suggest that {sigma}3 limits the production of IFN to control innate immune signaling and cell death following infection through a mechanism that is independent of its dsRNA binding capacity.\n\nIMPORTANCEWe use mammalian reovirus as a model to study how virus infection modulates innate immune signaling and cell death induction. Here we sought to determine how viral factors regulate these processes. Our work highlights a previously unknown role for the reovirus outer capsid protein {sigma}3 in limiting the induction of a necrotic form of cell death called necroptosis. Induction of cell death by necroptosis requires production of interferon. {sigma}3 limits the induction of necroptosis by preventing excessive production of interferon following infection.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticles are promising alternatives to antibiotics since nanoparticles are easy to manufacture, non-toxic, and do not promote resistance. Nanoparticles act via physical disruption of the bacterial membrane and/or the generation of high concentrations of reactive-oxygen species locally. Potential for physical disruption of the bacterial membrane may be quantified by free energy methods, such as the extended Derjuan-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory, which predicts the initial surface-material interactions. The generation of reactive-oxygen species may be quantified using enthalpies of formation to predict minimum inhibitory concentrations. Neither of these two quantitative structure-activity values describes the dynamic, in situ behavioral changes in the bacterias struggle to survive. In this paper, borrowing parameters from logistic, oscillatory, and diauxic growth models, we use principal component analysis and agglomerative hierarchical clustering to classify survival modes across nanoparticle types and concentrations. We compare the growth parameters of 170 experimental interactions between nanoparticles and bacteria. The bacteria studied include Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Helicobacter pylori, and were tested across multiple concentrations of liposomal drug delivery systems, amphiphilic peptide, and silver and selenium nanoparticles. Clustering reveals specific pairs of bacteria and nanoparticles where the nanoparticle induced growth dynamics could potentially spread the infection through the development of resistance and tolerance. This rapid screening also shows that bacteria generated nanoparticles do not induce growth modes indicative of the development of resistance. This methodology can be used to rapidly screen for novel therapeutics that do not induce resistance before using more robust intracellular content screening. This methodology can also be used as a quality check on batch manufactured nanoparticles.",

    "abstract": "The Shieldin complex, consisting of SHLD1, SHLD2, SHLD3 and REV7, shields DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) from nucleolytic resection. The end-protecting activity of Shieldin promotes productive non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) in G1 but can threaten genome integrity during S-phase by blocking homologous recombination (HR). Curiously, the penultimate Shieldin component, SHLD1 is one of the least abundant mammalian proteins. Here, we report that the transcription factors THAP1, YY1 and HCF1 bind directly to the SHLD1 promoter, where they cooperatively maintain the low basal expression of SHLD1. Functionally, this transcriptional network ensures that SHLD1 protein levels are kept in check to enable a proper balance between end protection and end resection during physiological DSB repair. In the context of BRCA1 deficiency, loss of THAP1 dependent SHLD1 expression confers cross resistance to PARP inhibitor and cisplatin, and shorter progression free survival in ovarian cancer patients. In contrast, loss of THAP1 in BRCA2 deficient cells increases genome instability and correlates with improved responses to chemotherapy. Pathogenic THAP1 mutations are causatively linked to the adult-onset torsion dystonia type 6 (DYT6) movement disorder, but the critical disease targets are unknown. We further demonstrate that murine models of Thap1-associated dystonia show reduced Shld1 expression concomitant with elevated levels of unresolved DNA damage in the brain. In summary, our study provides the first example of a transcriptional network that directly controls DSB repair choice and reveals a previously unsuspected link between DNA damage and dystonia.",

    "abstract": "Drones are now widely used to study wildlife, but applications for studying bioacoustics have been limited. Drones can be used to collect data on bird vocalizations, but an ongoing concern is that noise from the drones could change bird vocalization behavior. To test this behavioral impact we conducted an experiment using 30 sound localization arrays to track the song output of seven songbird species before, during, and after a 3-minute flight of a small quadcopter drone hovering at 50 m above ground level. We analyzed 8,303 song bouts, of which 2,285 song bouts of 184 individual birds were within 50 meters of the array centers. We used linear mixed effect models to assess patterns in song output showed patterns that could be attributed to the drones presence. We found no evidence of any effect of the drone for five species: American Robin Turdus migratorius, Common Yellowthroat Geothlypis trichas, Field Sparrow Spizella pusilla, Song Sparrow Melospiza melodia, and Indigo Bunting Passerina cyanea. However, we found a substantial decrease in Yellow Warbler Setophaga petechia song detections during the 3-minute drone hover, such that there was an 81% drop in detections in the 3rd minute (Wald-test, p<0.001), compared with before the drones introduction. In contrast, the number of singing Northern Cardinal Cardinalis cardinalis increased after the drone was introduced, and remained almost five-fold higher for 4-minutes after the drone departed (P<0.001). Further, we found an increase in cardinal contact/alarm calls when the drone was overhead, with the elevated calling-rate sustaining for 2 minutes after the drone had departed (P<0.001). Our study suggests that responses of songbirds to drones may be species-specific, an important consideration when proposing the use of drones in avian studies. We note that recent advances in drone technology have resulted in much quieter drones, which makes us hopeful that the impacts that we detected could be greatly reduced.",

Linear Mixed Model regression analyses of age at last encounter revealed variants in genes known to be linked with clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, which are associated with myelodysplastic syndromes, as top signals in our analysis, suggestive of age-related somatic mutation accumulation in hematopoietic cells despite patients lacking clinical diagnoses.

Several of those loci were also associated with brain structure differences across breeds; and six of the respective top-candidate genes are also associated with human brain structure and function. More broadly, the geneset of canine behavioral scans is supported by enrichment for genes mapped for human behavior, personality, cognition, psychopathology and brain structure. The biology implicated includes, neurogenesis, axon guidance, angiogenesis, brain structure, alternative splicing, disease association, Hox-family transcription factors, and subiculum expression. Because body size and behavior are correlated in dogs, we isolated the effect of body size in the dog mapping and in the comparative human UK Biobank analyses. Our dog findings are consistent with pleiotropy of diverse brain traits with energy metabolism and growth, and suggest behavioral variations often affect neurogenesis. There is support for such pleiotropy in humans and well-powered genetic studies of human psychiatric traits consistently implicate neurogenesis. We propose a genetic network which underlies neuron birth and development throughout life is associated with evolutionary adaptation of behavior and the general psychopathology factor. This understanding has implications for genetic and environmental contributions to psychiatric disease. We discuss how canine translational models can further accelerate the study of psychopathology.\n\nAuthor summaryWe genetically mapped diverse normal and problem behaviors in dogs. The well-established approach we used is ideally suited for finding variation that is common across dog breeds and for pin-pointing the most likely gene candidates. Our analysis of the genes implicated at 90 genome regions shows they are enriched for i) genes mapped for diverse brain functions and pathologies in humans; ii) genes involved in brain development throughout life; and iii) footprints of evolution in dogs, humans and other animals. We propose that is consistent with evolutionary conservation of the general genetic factor of mental health in humans, which is correlated with personality and intelligence. The implications are that this super-network of genes is preferentially targeted by evolutionary adaptation for behavior and that its dysregulation increases risk of mental health disorders.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBulk production of medium-chain carboxylates (MCCs) with 6-12 carbon atoms is of great interest to biotechnology. Open cultures (e.g., reactor microbiomes) have been utilized to generate MCCs in bioreactors. When in-line MCC extraction and prevention of product inhibition is required, the bioreactors have been operated at mildly acidic pH (5.0-5.5). However, model chain-elongating bacteria grow optimally at neutral pH values. Here, we isolated a chain-elongating bacterium (strain 7D4C2) that thrives at mildly acidic pH. We studied its metabolism and compared its whole genome and the reverse {beta}-oxidation (rBOX) genes to other bacteria.\n\nResultsStrain 7D4C2 produces lactate, acetate, n-butyrate, n-caproate, biomass, and H2/CO2 from hexoses. With only fructose as substrate (pH 5.5), the maximum n-caproate specificity (i.e., products per other carboxylates produced) was 60.9 {+/-} 1.5%. However, this was considerably higher at 83.1 {+/-} 0.44% when both fructose and n-butyrate (electron acceptor) were combined as a substrate. A comparison of serum bottles with fructose and n-butyrate with an increasing pH value from 4.5 to 9.0 showed a decreasing n-caproate specificity from [~]92% at mildly acidic pH (pH 4.5-5.0) to [~]24% at alkaline pH (pH 9.0). Moreover, when carboxylates were extracted from the broth (undissociated n-caproic acid was [~]0.3 mM), the n-caproate selectivity (i.e., product per substrate fed) was 42.6 {+/-} 19.0% higher compared to serum bottles without extraction. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence, strain 7D4C2 is most closely related to the isolates Caproicibacter fermentans (99.5%) and Caproiciproducens galactitolivorans (94.7%), which are chain-elongating bacteria that are also capable of lactate production. Whole-genome analyses indicate that strain 7D4C2, C. fermentans, and C. galactitolivorans belong to the same genus of Caproiciproducens. Their rBOX genes are conserved and located next to each other, forming a gene cluster, which is different than for other chain-elongating bacteria such as Megasphaera spp.\n\nConclusionsCaproiciproducens spp., comprising strain 7D4C2, C. fermentans, C. galactitolivorans, and several unclassified strains, are chain-elongating bacteria that encode a highly conserved rBOX gene cluster. Caproiciproducens sp. 7D4C2 (DSM 110548) was studied here to understand n-caproate production better at mildly acidic pH within microbiomes and has the additional potential as a pure-culture production strain to convert sugars into n-caproate.",

    "abstract": "Populations of microbes are constantly evolving heterogeneity that selection acts upon, yet heterogeneity is non-trivial to assess methodologically. The practice of isolating single cell colonies for establishing, transferring, and using a strain results in single-cell bottlenecks with a generally neglected effect on the characteristics of the strain. We used six industrial yeasts to assess the level of heterogeneity in clonal populations, especially in terms of stress tolerance. First, we uncovered the existence of genome structure variants in available sequenced genomes of clonal lineages of thes strains. Subsequent phenotyping of strains and their newly isolated subclones showed that single-cell bottlenecks during isolation can considerably influence the observable phenotype. Next, we decoupled fitness distributions on the level of individual cells from clonal interference by plating single cell colonies. We used the obtained data on colony area for statistical modeling of the heterogeneity in phenotypes. One strain was further used to show how individual subclonal lineages are remarkably different not just in phenotype, but also in the level of heterogeneity. Thereby we call attention to the fact that choosing an initial clonal lineage from an industrial yeast strain may vastly influence downstream performances and observations on geno- and phenotype, and also on heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Learning induces structural changes in the brain. Especially repeated, long-term behaviors, such as extensive training of playing a musical instrument, are likely to produce characteristic features to brain structure. However, it is not clear to what extent such structural features can be extracted from magnetic resonance images of the brain. Here we show that it is possible to predict whether a person is a musician or a non-musician based on the thickness of the cerebral cortex measured at 148 brain regions en-compassing the whole cortex. Using a supervised machine-learning technique, we achieved a significant ({kappa} = 0.321, p < 0.001) agreement between the actual and predicted participant groups of 30 musicians and 85 non-musicians. The areas contributing to the prediction were mostly in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes of the left hemisphere. Our results suggest that decoding musicianship from magnetic resonance images of brain structure is feasible. Further, the distribution of the areas that were informative in the classification, which mostly, but not entirely, overlapped with earlier findings on areas relevant for musical skills, implies that decoding-based analyses of structural properties of the brain can reveal novel aspects of musical aptitude. In particular, our results highlight differences in visual areas in addition to the already more established differences located in motor networks and networks of higher-order cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "Cell-free gene expression (CFE) systems from crude cellular extracts have attracted much attention for accelerating the design of cellular function, on-demand biomanufacturing, portable diagnostics, and educational kits. Many essential biological processes that could endow CFE systems with desired functions, such as protein glycosylation, rely on the activity of membrane-bound components. However, without the use of synthetic membrane mimics, activating membrane-dependent functionality in bacterial CFE systems remains largely unstudied. Here, we address this gap by characterizing native, cell-derived membrane vesicles in Escherichia coli-based CFE extracts and describing methods to enrich vesicles with heterologous, membranebound machinery. We first use nanocharacterization techniques to show that lipid vesicles in CFE extracts are tens to hundreds of nanometers across, and on the order of ~3x1012 particles/mL. We then determine how extract processing methods, such as post-lysis centrifugation, can be used to modulate concentrations of membrane vesicles in CFE systems. By tuning these methods, we show that increasing the number of vesicle particles to ~7x1012 particles/mL can be used to increase concentrations of heterologous membrane protein cargo expressed prior to lysis. Finally, we apply our methods to enrich membrane-bound oligosaccharyltransferases and lipid-linked oligosaccharides for improving N-linked and O-linked glycoprotein synthesis. We anticipate that our findings will facilitate in vitro gene expression systems that require membrane-dependent activities and open new opportunities in glycoengineering.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe RNA-binding protein FXR1 (fragile X-related protein 1) has been implicated as an important regulator of post-transcriptional changes of mRNAs. However, its role in mRNA circularization and recruitment of eukaryotic translation initiation factors for protein translation remains obscure. Here, we aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms and potential clinical applications of FXR1 in ovarian cancer growth and progression.\n\nMethodsFXR1 copy number variation, mRNA expression, protein levels, and their association with prognosis were determined in clinical datasets. An orthotopic ovarian cancer model and bioluminescence imaging were used for preclinical evaluation of FXR1 in vivo. Reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) and qPCR arrays were performed to identify FXR1s key targets and downstream effects. SUnSET and polysome profiling were used to determine the translational effects of FXR1. Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were performed to identify the interaction between FXR1 and cMYC mRNA and eIF4F complex. RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP), RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays (REMSA), proximity ligation assays (PLA), and biochemical assays were used to identify the specific site on cMYC mRNA to which FXR1 binds to promote mRNA circularization and translation.\n\nResultsWe found that amplification and copy-gain of FXR1 increased the expression of FXR1 mRNA and FXR1 protein in ovarian cancer patients, and these events associated with poor prognosis. We demonstrated that FXR1 binds to AU-rich elements (ARE) within the 3 untranslated region (3UTR) of cMYC. As a consequence, FXR1 binding to cMYC 3UTR leads to the circularization of mRNA and facilitated the recruitment of eukaryotic translation initiation factors (eIFs) to translation start site for improving protein synthesis.\n\nConclusionWe found that FXR1 upregulates a known oncogene, cMYC, by binding to AU-rich elements within the 3UTR, leading to the recruitment of the eIF4F complex for cMYC translation. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism of action of FXR1 in tumorigenesis and provides opportunities to use FXR1 and its downstream effectors as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in ovarian and other cancers.",

    "abstract": "Blood clots are essential biomaterials that prevent blood loss and provide a temporary scaffold for tissue repair. In their function, these materials must be capable of resisting mechanical forces from hemodynamic shear and contractile tension without rupture. Fibrin networks, the primary load-bearing element in blood clots, have unique nonlinear mechanical properties resulting from their hierarchical structure, which provides multiscale load bearing from fiber deformation to protein unfolding. Here, we study the fiber and molecular scale response of fibrin under shear and tensile loads in situ using a combination of fluorescence and vibrational (molecular) microscopy. Imaging protein fiber orientation and molecular vibrations, we find that fiber orientation and molecular changes in fibrin appear at much larger strains under shear compared to uniaxial tension. Orientation levels reached at 150% shear strain were reached already at 60% tensile strain, and molecular unfolding of fibrin was only seen at shear strains above 300%, whereas fibrin unfolding began already at 20% tensile strain. Moreover, shear deformation caused progressive changes in vibrational modes consistent with increased protofibril and fiber packing that were already present even at very low tensile deformation. Together with a bioinformatic analysis of the fibrinogen primary structure, we propose a scheme for the molecular response of fibrin from low to high deformation, which may relate to the teleological origin of its resistance to shear and tensile forces.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=71 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/205005v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d72dfborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10bed75org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12d33aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e9b40f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Large portions of eukaryotic genomes consist of transposable elements (TEs), and the establishment of transcription-repressing heterochromatin during early development safeguards genome integrity in Drosophila. Repeat-rich Y chromosomes can act as reservoirs for TEs ( toxic Y effect), and incomplete epigenomic defenses during early development can lead to deleterious TE mobilization. Here, we contrast the dynamics of early TE activation in two Drosophila species with vastly different Y chromosomes of different age. Zygotic TE expression is elevated in male embryos relative to females in both species, mostly due to expression of Y-linked TEs. Interestingly, male-biased TE misexpression diminishes across development in D. pseudoobscura, but remains elevated in D. miranda, the species with the younger and larger Y chromosome. The repeat-rich Y of D. miranda still contains many actively transcribed genes, which compromise the formation of silencing heterochromatin. Elevated TE expression results in more de novo insertions of repeats in males compared to females. This lends support to the idea that the  toxic Y chromosome can create a mutational burden in males when genome-wide defense mechanisms are compromised, and suggests a previously unappreciated epigenetic conflict on evolving Y chromosomes between transcription of essential genes and silencing of selfish DNA.",

MMBIR events appear only as germline variants in normal human fibroblast cells but readily accumulate de novo across several cancer types.

    "abstract": "The hallmarks of constitutive heterochromatin, HP1 and H3K9me2/3, assemble heterochromatin-like domains/complexes outside canonical constitutively heterochromatic territories where they regulate chromatin-templated processes. Domains are more than 100kb in size; complexes less than 100kb. They are present in the genomes of organisms ranging from fission yeast to man, with an expansion in size and number in mammals. Some of the likely functions of the domains/complexes include silencing of the donor mating type region in fission yeast, regulation of mammalian imprinted genes and the phylotypic progression during vertebrate development. Far cis- and trans-contacts between micro-phase separated domains/complexes in mammalian nuclei contribute to the emergence of epigenetic compartmental domains (ECDs) detected in Hi-C maps. We speculate that a thermodynamic description of micro-phase separation of heterochromatin-like domains/complexes will require a gestalt shift away from the monomer as the \"unit of incompatibility\", where it is the choice of monomer that determines the sign and magnitude of the Flory-Huggins parameter, {chi}. Instead, a more dynamic structure, the oligo-nucleosomal \"clutch\", consisting of between 2 to 10 nucleosomes is both the long sought-after secondary structure of chromatin and its unit of incompatibility. Based on this assumption we present a simple theoretical framework that enables an estimation of {chi} for domains/complexes flanked by euchromatin and thereby an indication of their tendency to phase separate. The degree of phase separation is specified by {chi}N, where N is the number of \"clutches\" in a domain/complex. Our approach may provide an additional tool for understanding the biophysics of the 3D genome.",

It is therefore believed that their cellular function is to sequester in the nucleus their associated proteins and/or target mRNAs. However, little is known about the molecular determinant in mRNA targets that allow their association to paraspeckles except that inverted repeats of Alu sequences (IRAlu) present in 3UTR of mRNAs may allow this association. While in a previous study we established the list of paraspeckle target RNAs in a rat pituitary cell line, we didnt find however, inverted repeated SINEs, the rat equivalent of primate IRAlus in 3UTR of these RNAs. By developing a candidate gene strategy, we selected a paraspeckle target gene, namely calreticulin mRNA, and we searched for other potential RNA recruitment elements in its 3UTR, since 3UTRs usually contain the sequence recognition for nuclear localization. We found a 15-nucleotide sequence, present as a tandem repeat in 3UTR of this mRNA, which is involved in the nuclear retention by paraspeckles. While being not overrepresented in the 3UTR of the paraspeckle target RNAs, this recruitment element was present in near 30% of all 3UTR mRNAs. In addition, since an oligonucleotide containing this sequence binds the paraspeckle protein component HNRNPK, it is proposed that HNRNPK may constitute a bridging protein between paraspeckles and target mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Amyloid fibrils are aberrant protein aggregates associated with various amyloidoses and neurodegenerative diseases. It is recently indicated that structural diversity of amyloid fibrils often results in different pathological phenotypes including cytotoxicity and infectivity. The diverse structures are predicted to propagate by seed-dependent growth, which is one of the characteristic properties of amyloid fibrils. However, much remains unknown regarding how exactly the amyloid structures are inherited to subsequent generations by seeding reaction. Here, we investigated the behaviors of self- and cross-seeding of amyloid fibrils of human and bovine insulin in terms of thioflavin T fluorescence, morphology, secondary structure, and iodine staining. Insulin amyloid fibrils exhibited different structures depending on species, and each of which replicated in self-seeding. In contrast, gradual structural changes were observed in cross-seeding, and a new-type amyloid structure with distinct morphology and cytotoxicity was formed when human insulin was seeded with bovine insulin fibrils. Remarkably, iodine staining tracked changes in amyloid structure sensitively, and singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis of the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the fibril-bound iodine has revealed the presence of one or more intermediate metastable states during the structural changes. From these findings, we propose a propagation scheme with multistep structural changes in cross-seeding between two heterologous proteins, which is accounted for as a consequence of the rugged energy landscape of amyloid formation.",

    "abstract": "From insects to humans, calcium signaling is essential for life. An important part of this process is the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum calcium pump SERCA, which maintains low cytosolic calcium levels required for intracellular calcium homeostasis. In higher organisms, this is a tightly controlled system where SERCA interacts with tissuespecific regulatory subunits such as phospholamban in cardiac muscle and sarcolipin in skeletal muscle. With the recent discovery of the sarcolambans, the family of calcium pump regulatory subunits also appears to be ancient, spanning more than 550 million years of evolutionary divergence from insects to humans. This evolutionary divergence is reflected in the peptide sequences, which vary enormously from one another and range from vaguely phospholamban-like to vaguely sarcolipin-like. Here, our goal was to investigate select sarcolamban peptides for their ability to regulate calcium pump activity. For a side-by-side comparison of diverse sarcolamban peptides, we tested them against mammalian skeletal muscle SERCA1a. This allowed us to determine if the sarcolamban peptides mimic phospholamban and sarcolipin in their regulatory activities. Four sarcolamban peptides were chosen from different invertebrate species. Of these, we were able to express and purify sarcolamban peptides from bumble bee, water flea, and tadpole shrimp. Sarcolamban peptides were co-reconstituted into proteoliposomes with mammalian SERCA1a and the effect of each peptide on the apparent calcium affinity and maximal activity of SERCA was measured. While all peptides were super-inhibitors of SERCA, they exhibited either phospholamban-like or sarcolipin-like characteristics. Molecular modeling, protein-protein docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were used to reveal novel features of insect versus mammalian calcium pumps and the sarcolamban regulatory subunits.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionCell structure and migration is impacted by the mechanical properties and geometry of the cell adhesive environment. Most studies to date investigating the effects of 3D environments on cells have not controlled geometry at the single-cell level, making it difficult to understand the influence of 3D environmental cues on single cells. Here, we developed microwell platforms to investigate the effects of 2D vs 3D geometries on single-cell F-actin and nuclear organization.\n\nMethodsWe used microfabrication techniques to fabricate three polyacrylamide platforms: 3D microwells with a 3D adhesive environment (3D/3D), 3D microwells with 2D adhesive areas at the bottom only (3D/2D), and flat 2D gels with 2D patterned adhesive areas (2D/2D). We measured geometric swelling and Youngs modulus of the platforms. We then cultured C2C12 myoblasts on each platform and evaluated the effects of the engineered microenvironments on F-actin structure and nuclear shape.\n\nResultsWe tuned the mechanical characteristics of the microfabricated platforms by manipulating the gel formulation. Crosslinker ratio strongly influenced geometric swelling whereas total polymer content primarily affected Youngs modulus. When comparing cells in these platforms, we found significant effects on F-actin and nuclear structures. Our analysis showed that a 3D/3D environment was necessary to increase actin and nuclear height. A 3D/2D environment was sufficient to increase actin alignment and nuclear aspect ratio compared to a 2D/2D environment.\n\nConclusionsUsing our novel polyacrylamide platforms, we were able to decouple the effects of 3D confinement and adhesive environment, finding that both influenced actin and nuclear structure.",
