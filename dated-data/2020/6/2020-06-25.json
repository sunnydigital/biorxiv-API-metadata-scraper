    "abstract": "Genetic drift is a basic evolutionary principle describing random changes in allelic frequencies, with far-reaching consequences in various topics ranging from species conservation efforts to speciation. The conventional approach assumes that genetic drift has the same effect on all populations undergoing the same change in size, regardless of different behaviors and history of the populations. However, here we reason that processes leading to a systematic increase of individuals chances of survival, such as learning or immunological memory, can mitigate the effects of genetic drift even if the overall mortality rate in the population does not change. We further test this notion in an agent-based model monitoring allele frequencies in a population of prey, either able or not able to learn. Importantly, both these populations start with the same effective size and have the same and constant overall mortality rates. Our results demonstrate that even under these conditions, learning can mitigate drift if generations overlap. Furthermore, this effect holds regardless if the population is haploid or diploid or whether it reproduces sexually or asexually. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that learning is an overlooked factor affecting the effective population size. These findings may be of importance not only for basic evolutionary theory but also for other fields using the concept of genetic drift.",

    "abstract": "Resolving the molecular processes that mediate genetic risk remains a challenge as most disease-associated variants are non-coding and functional and bioinformatic characterization of these signals requires knowledge of the specific tissues and cell-types in which they operate. To address this challenge, we developed a framework for integrating tissue-specific gene expression and epigenomic maps (primarily from tissues involved in insulin secretion and action) to obtain tissue-of-action (TOA) scores for each association signal by systematically partitioning posterior probabilities from Bayesian fine-mapping. We applied this scheme to credible set variants for 380 association signals from a recent GWAS meta-analysis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Europeans. The resulting tissue profiles underscored a predominant role for pancreatic islets and, to a lesser extent, subcutaneous adipose and liver, that was largely attributable to enhancer elements and transcribed regions, particularly among signals with greater fine-mapping resolution. We incorporated resulting TOA scores into a rule-based classifier, and validated the tissue assignments through comparison with data from cis-eQTL enrichment, functional fine-mapping, RNA co-expression, and patterns of physiological association. In addition to implicating signals with a single tissue-of-action, we also found evidence for signals with shared effects in multiple tissues as well as distinct tissue profiles between independent signals within heterogeneous loci. Lastly, we demonstrated that TOA scores can be directly coupled with eQTL colocalization to further resolve effector transcripts at T2D signals. This framework guides mechanistic inference by directing functional validation studies to the most relevant tissues and can gain power as fine-mapping resolution and cell-specific annotations become richer. This method is generalizable to all complex traits with relevant annotation data and is made available as an R package.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell (sc) sequencing performs unbiased profiling of individual cells and enables evaluation of less prevalent cellular populations, often missed using bulk sequencing. However, the scale and the complexity of the sc datasets poses a great challenge in its utility and this problem is further exacerbated when working with larger datasets typically generated by consortium efforts. As the scale of single cell datasets continues to increase exponentially, there is an unmet technological need to develop database platforms that can evaluate key biological hypothesis by querying extensive single-cell datasets.\n\nLarge single-cell datasets like human cell atlas and COVID-19 cell atlas (collection of annotated sc datasets from various human organs) are excellent resources for profiling target genes involved in human diseases and disorders ranging from oncology, auto-immunity, as well as infectious diseases like COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. SARS-CoV-2 infections have led to a worldwide pandemic with massive loss of lives, infections exceeding 7 million cases. The virus uses ACE2 and TMPRSS2 as key viral entry associated proteins expressed in human cells for infections. Evaluating the expression profile of key genes in large single-cell datasets can facilitate testing for diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine targets; as the world struggles to cope with the on-going spread of COVID-19 infections.\n\nIn this manuscript we describe, REVEAL: SingleCell which enables storage, retrieval and rapid query of single-cell datasets inclusive of millions of cells. The analytical database described here enables selecting and analyzing cells across multiple studies. Cells can be selected using individual metadata tags, more complex hierarchical ontology filtering, and gene expression threshold ranges, including co-expression of multiple genes. The tags on selected cells can be further evaluated for testing biological hypothesis. One such example includes identifying the most prevalent cell type annotation tag on returned cells.\n\nWe used REVEAL: SingleCell to evaluate expression of key SARS-CoV-2 entry associated genes, and queried the current database (2.2 Million cells, 32 projects) to obtain the results in <60 seconds. We highlighted cells expressing COVID-19 associated genes are expressed on multiple tissue types, thus in part explains the multi-organ involvement in infected patients observed worldwide during the on-going COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "VDAC (Voltage Dependent Anion Channel) is a family of pore forming protein located in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Its channel property ensures metabolites exchange between mitochondria and the rest of the cell resulting in metabolism and bioenergetics regulation, and in cell death and life switch. VDAC1 is the best characterized and most abundant isoform, and is involved in many pathologies, as cancer or neurodegenerative diseases. However, little information is available about its gene expression regulation in normal and/or pathological conditions. In this work, we explored VDAC1 gene expression regulation in normal conditions and in the contest of metabolic and energetic mitochondrial dysfunction and cell stress. The most active area of the putative promoter region was characterized in terms of transcription factors responsive elements both by bioinformatic studies and promoter activity experiments. In particular, we found a predominant presence of NRF-1 together with other transcription factors binding sites, involved in cell growth, proliferation, development and we studied their prevalence in gene activity. Furthermore, upon depletion of nutrients or controlled hypoxia, as reported in various pathologies, we found that VDAC1 transcripts levels were significantly increased in a time related manner. VDAC1 promoter activity was also validated by gene reporter assays. According to PCR real-time data, it was confirmed that VDAC1 promoter activity is further stimulated when are exposed to stress. A bioinformatic survey suggested NRF-1 e HIF-1 as the most active TFBS. Their validation was obtained by mutagenesis and overexpression experiments. In conclusion, we demonstrated experimentally the involvement of both NRF-1 and HIF-1 in the regulation of VDAC1 promoter activation at basal level and in cell stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "Quantitative PCR is frequently used to measure average telomere length (TL) relative to the TL of a reference DNA sample of the investigators choosing. This makes comparisons of TLs across studies and laboratories difficult. Here we demonstrate that a single synthetic single-stranded dual-template oligonucleotide (DTO) containing both a telomere repeat sequence (T) and a segment of the human beta-globin (HBB) single copy gene (S) can be used as a universal reference standard for monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR (MMqPCR) measurements of average TL using SYBR Green I as the only fluorescent reporter dye. A set of twelve concentrations of the DTO is prepared by serial 3-fold dilutions, to a lowest concentration of ~20 copies per l. The 5 highest concentrations are used for the T standard curve, and the 5 lowest concentrations are used for the S standard curve. For each reaction 5 l containing approximately 3 ng of genomic DNA (or one of the DTO dilutions) is mixed with 5 l of a 2x MasterMix containing the primers for T and S amplification, and MMqPCR is performed. The design of the primers and thermal cycling profile allows all T amplification signals to be collected before exponential amplification of the S signal begins. Exponential amplification from S is then carried out in a temperature range that keeps the telomere product fully melted and therefore unable to influence the S amplification signal. The T value for each DNA sample is the Standard Curve DTO dilution that contains the same number of copies of the telomere sequence as the experimental sample, and the S value is the DTO dilution that contains the same number of copies of the single copy gene sequence as the experimental sample. Dividing the first dilution by the second dilution yields an absolute T/S ratio, since it is expressed relative to the fixed 1:1 T/S ratio that is built into the DTO by design. Absolute T/S ratios for average TL in 48 human DNA samples determined by this method correlated strongly with mean Terminal Restriction Fragment (mTRF) lengths for the same DNA samples determined by the Southern Blot method (R-squared = 0.801). This DTO and the accompanying protocol may facilitate the standardization of average telomere length measurements and analyses across laboratories.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT70 kDa heat shock proteins (Hsp70) are essential chaperones of the protein quality control network; vital for cellular fitness and longevity. The four cytosolic Hsp70\u2019s in yeast, Ssa1-4, are thought to be functionally redundant but the absence of Ssa1 and Ssa2 causes a severe reduction in cellular reproduction and accelerates replicative aging. In our efforts to identify which Hsp70 activities are most important for longevity assurance, we systematically investigated the capacity of Ssa4 to carry out the different activities performed by Ssa1/2 by overproducing Ssa4 in cells lacking these Hsp70 chaperones. We found that Ssa4, when overproduced in cells lacking Ssa1/2, rescued growth, mitigated aggregate formation, restored spatial deposition of aggregates into protein inclusions, and promoted protein degradation. In contrast, Ssa4 overproduction in the Hsp70 deficient cells failed to restore the recruitment of the disaggregase Hsp104 to misfolded/aggregated proteins, to fully restore clearance of protein aggregates, and to bring back the formation of the nucleolus-associated aggregation compartment. Exchanging the nucleotide-binding domain of Ssa4 with that of Ssa1 suppressed this \u2018defect\u2019 of Ssa4. Interestingly, Ssa4 overproduction extended the short lifespan of ssa1\u0394 ssa2\u0394 mutant cells to a lifespan comparable to, or even longer than, wild type cells, demonstrating that Hsp104-dependent aggregate clearance is not a prerequisite for longevity assurance in yeast.AUTHOR SUMMARY All organisms have proteins that network together to stabilize and protect the cell throughout its lifetime. One of these types of proteins are the Hsp70s (heat shock protein 70). Hsp70 proteins take part in folding other proteins to their functional form, untangling proteins from aggregates, organize aggregates inside the cell and ensure that damaged proteins are destroyed. In this study, we investigated three closely related Hsp70 proteins in yeast; Ssa1, 2 and 4, in an effort to describe the functional difference of Ssa4 compared to Ssa1 and 2 and to answer the question: What types of cellular stress protection are necessary to reach a normal lifespan? We show that Ssa4 can perform many of the same tasks as Ssa1 and 2, but Ssa4 doesn\u2019t interact in the same manner as Ssa1 and 2 with other types of proteins. This leads to a delay in removing protein aggregates created after heat stress. Ssa4 also cannot ensure that misfolded proteins aggregate correctly inside the nucleus of the cell. However, this turns out not to be necessary for yeast cells to achieve a full lifespan, which shows us that as long as cells can prevent aggregates from forming in the first place, they can reach a full lifespan.Competing Interest StatementD. \u00d6. is employed by AstraZeneca M\u00f6lndal, Sweden\nF.E. is employed by AstraZeneca M\u00f6lndal, Sweden\nS.H. is employed by Cochlear Nordic AB, M\u00f6lnlycke, SwedenView Full Text",

Yet, analysis of many species is hindered because they grow in regions that lack infrastructure for advanced molecular biology. We developed and adapted low-cost methods that address these issues.

We have optimized low-cost home-made DNA extraction to increase yields, reduce costs, and produce DNA suitable for next generation sequencing. We also describe how to build a gel documentation system for DNA quantification. As a proof of principle, we use these methods to evaluate wild Berberis darwinii, native to Southern Chile.Method summary We describe a suite of low-cost do-it-yourself methods for field collection of plant tissues, extraction of genomic DNA suitable for next generation sequencing, and home-made agarose gel documentation suitable for DNA quantification.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTOne evolutionary path from hermaphroditism to dioecy is via a gynodioecious intermediate. The evolution of dioecy may also coincide with the formation of sex chromosomes that possess sex-determining loci that are physically linked in a region of suppressed recombination. Dioecious papaya (Carica papaya) has an XY chromosome system, where the presence of a Y chromosome determines males. However, in cultivation, papaya is gynodioecious, due to the conversion of the male Y chromosome to a hermaphroditic Yh chromosome during its domestication. We investigated gene expression linked to the X, Y, and Yh chromosomes at different floral developmental stages in order to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that may be involved in the sexual reversion of males to hermaphrodites. We identified 309 sex-biased genes found on the sex chromosomes, most of which are found in the pseudoautosomal regions (PARs). Female (XX) expression in the sex determining region (SDR) was almost double that of X-linked expression in males (XY) and hermaphrodites (XYh), which rules out dosage compensation for most sex-linked gene; although, an analysis of hemizygous X-linked loci found evidence of partial dosage compensation. Furthermore, we identified a potential candidate gene associated with both sex determination and the transition to hermaphroditism, a homolog of the MADS-box protein SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVG).Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

With an aging population, the prevalence of neurodegenerative and vascular disease increases; and so does the indication for MRI exams in patients with such implants. In response to this growing need for MRI, many groups have investigated strategies to mitigate the RF heating of the implants. These efforts, however, have relied either on simulations with homogenous body models or simplified phantom experiments (box shaped phantom with single tissue). It is well established, however, that the shape and heterogeneity of human body affects the distribution of MRI electric fields, which by proxy, alters the RF heating of an implant inside the body. In this contribution, we applied numerical simulations and phantom experiments to examine the effectiveness of RF heating mitigation strategies under variant patient body compositions, focusing on two recently proposed techniques: (a) surgical modification of DBS lead trajectories inside the body, and (b) use of a patient-adjustable reconfigurable MRI coil, both aiming to reduce the coupling of implanted leads and MRI electric fields. Our results demonstrated that both techniques perform well under variant body compositions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

However, this platform has several issues in terms of the materials used (e.g., polydimethylsiloxane), such as the absorbance of tested drug candidates and fluorescent dyes by the material, as well as the effect on cultured cellular status, thus misleading the results obtained from cell assays and fabrication processes. Hence, to eliminate the issues mentioned above, we developed a cyclo olefin polymer (COP)-based MPS via photobonding process using vacuum ultraviolet (VUV), named COP-VUV-MPS. COP-VUV-MPS showed better chemical resistance and avoided molecule absorption. COP-VUV-MPS could maintain the stemness of environmentally sensitive human-induced pluripotent stem cells without causing undesired cellular phenotypes and gene expression. These results suggested that COP-VUV-MPS might be broadly used for the advancement of MPS and applications in drug development and in vitro toxicological testing.Competing Interest StatementM.Y. is an employee of Ushio Inc.

Therefore, a computational model is highly desired to accurately predict protein solubility from the amino acid sequence. Many methods have been developed, but they are mostly based on the one-dimensional embedding of amino acids that is limited to catch spatially structural information.\n\nResultsIn this study, we have developed a new structure-aware method to predict protein solubility by attentive graph convolutional network (GCN), where the protein topology attribute graph was constructed through predicted contact maps from the sequence. GraphSol was shown to substantially out-perform other sequence-based methods. The model was proven to be stable by consistent R2 of 0.48 in both the cross-validation and independent test of the eSOL dataset.

    "abstract": "Resting functional MRI studies of the infant brain are increasingly becoming an important tool in developmental neuroscience. Whereas the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity (FC) measures derived from resting fMRI data have been characterized in the adult and child brain, similar assessments have not been conducted in infants. In this study, we examined the intra-session test-retest reliability of FC measures from 119 infant brain MRI scans from four neurodevelopmental studies. We investigated edge-level and subject-level reliability within one MRI session (between and within runs) measured by the Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). First, using an atlas-based approach, we examined whole-brain connectivity as well as connectivity within two common resting fMRI networks - the default mode network (DMN) and the sensorimotor network (SMN). Second, we examined the influence of run duration, study site, and scanning manufacturer (e.g., Philips and General Electric) on ICCs. Lastly, we tested spatial similarity using the Jaccard Index from networks derived from independent component analysis (ICA). Consistent with resting fMRI studies from adults, our findings indicated poor edge-level reliability (ICC = 0.14 - 0.18), but moderate-to-good subject-level intra-session reliability for whole-brain, DMN, and SMN connectivity (ICC = 0.40 - 0.78). We also found significant effects of run duration, site, and scanning manufacturer on reliability estimates. Some ICA-derived networks showed strong spatial reproducibility (e.g., DMN, SMN, and Visual Network), and were labelled based on their spatial similarity to analogous networks measured in adults. These networks were reproducibly found across different study studies. However, other ICA-networks (e.g. Executive Control Network) did not show strong spatial reproducibility, suggesting that the reliability and/or maturational course of functional connectivity may vary by network. In sum, our findings suggest that developmental scientist may be on safe ground examining the functional organization of some major neural networks (e.g. DMN and SMN), but judicious interpretation of functional connectivity is essential to its ongoing success.\n\nHighlightsO_LIInfant functional connectivity (FC) shows poor edge-level reliability (ICCs)\nC_LIO_LIHowever, subject-level infant FC estimates show good-to-excellent ICCs\nC_LIO_LISpatial reproducibility is better for some resting networks (DMN, SMN) than others (ECN)\nC_LIO_LIReliability estimates differ across study site and MRI scanner\nC_LIO_LIConclusion - Infant FC can be a reliable measurement, but judicious use is needed\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "AimModelling African great ape distribution has until now focused on current or past conditions, whilst future scenarios remain scarcely explored. Using an ensemble forecasting approach, we predicted changes in taxon-specific distribution under future scenarios of climate, land-use and human population changes.\n\nLocationSub-Saharan Africa\n\nMethodsWe compiled occurrence data on African ape populations from the IUCN A.P.E.S. database and extracted relevant human-, climate- and habitat-related predictors representing current and future (2050) conditions to predict taxon-specific distribution under a best- and a worst-case scenario, using ensemble forecasting. Given the large effect on model predictions, we further tested algorithm sensitivity by considering default and non-default modelling options. The latter included interactions between predictors and polynomial terms in correlative algorithms.\n\nResultsThe future distributions of gorilla and bonobo populations are likely to be directly determined by climate-related variables. In contrast, future chimpanzee distribution is influenced mostly by anthropogenic variables. Both our modelling approaches produced similar model accuracy, although a slight difference in the magnitude of range change was found for Gorilla beringei beringei, G. gorilla diehli, and Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii. On average, a decline of 50% of the geographic range (non-default; or 55% default) is expected under the best scenario if no dispersal occurs (57% non-default or 58% default in worst scenario). However, new areas of suitable habitat are predicted to become available for most taxa if dispersal occurs (81% or 103% best, 93% or 91% worst, non-default and default, respectively), except for G. b. beringei.\n\nMain ConclusionsDespite the uncertainty in predicting the precise proportion of suitable habitat by 2050, both modelling approaches predict large range losses for all African apes. Thus, conservation planners urgently need to integrate land-use planning and simultaneously support conservation and climate change mitigation measures at all decision-making levels both in range countries and abroad.",

    "abstract": "Phenology-the timing of life-history events-is a key trait for understanding responses of organisms to climate. The digitization and online mobilization of herbarium specimens is rapidly advancing our understanding of plant phenological response to climate and climatic change. The current practice of manually harvesting data from individual specimens, however, greatly restricts our ability to scale-up data collection. Recent investigations have demonstrated that machine-learning approaches can facilitate this effort. However, present attempts have focused largely on simplistic binary coding of reproductive phenology (e.g., presence/absence of flowers). Here, we use crowd-sourced phenological data of buds, flowers, and fruits from > 3000 specimens of six common wildflower species of the eastern United States (Anemone canadensis L., A. hepatica L., A. quinquefolia L., Trillium erectum L., T. grandiflorum (Michx.) Salisb., and T. undulatum Wild.) to train models using Mask R-CNN to segment and count phenological features. A single global model was able to automate the binary coding of each of the three reproductive stages with > 87% accuracy. We also successfully estimated the relative abundance of each reproductive structure on a specimen with [&ge;] 90% accuracy. Precise counting of features was also successful, but accuracy varied with phenological stage and taxon. Specifically, counting flowers was significantly less accurate than buds or fruits likely due to their morphological variability on pressed specimens. Moreover, our Mask R-CNN model provided more reliable data than non-expert crowd-sourcers but not botanical experts, highlighting the importance of high-quality human training data. Finally, we also demonstrated the transferability of our model to automated phenophase detection and counting of the three Trillium species, which have large and conspicuously-shaped reproductive organs. These results highlight the promise of our two-phase crowd-sourcing and machine-learning pipeline to segment and count reproductive features of herbarium specimens, thus providing high-quality data with which to investigate plant response to ongoing climatic change.",

    "abstract": "Within the cell, there are compartments and local conditions that may constrain amino acid sequence. Life emerged in an anoxic world but releasing a photosynthesis by-product, the molecular oxygen, forced adaptive changes to counteract its toxicity. Several mechanisms evolved to balance the intracellular redox state and maintain a reductive environment more compatible with many essential biological functions. Here, we statistically interrogate the aminoacidic composition of E. coli proteins and investigate how the proneness or susceptibility to oxidation of amino acid biased their sequences. By sorting the proteins in five different compartments: cytoplasm, internal membrane, periplasm, outer membrane and extracellular; we found that various oxidative lesions constrain protein composition, that there is a dependency of the cellular compartments and there is an impact on the evenness distribution or frequency. This analysis is necessary from an evolutionary point of view to reflect how the oxidative atmosphere could restrict protein composition and probably imposed a trend in the codon bias.",

    "abstract": "Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) affects approximately 7-9 children per 1000 live births. Numerous genetic studies have established a role for rare genomic variants at the copy number variation (CNV) and single nucleotide variant level. In particular, the role of de novo mutations (DNM) has been highlighted in syndromic and non-syndromic CHD. To identify novel haploinsufficient CHD disease genes we performed an integrative analysis of CNVs and DNMs identified in probands with CHD including cases with sporadic thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA). We assembled CNV data from 7,958 cases and 14,082 controls and performed a gene-wise analysis of the burden of rare genomic deletions in cases versus controls. In addition, we performed mutation rate testing for DNMs identified in 2,489 parent-offspring trios. Our combined analysis revealed 21 genes which were significantly affected by rare genomic deletions and/or constrained non-synonymous de novo mutations in probands. Fourteen of these genes have previously been associated with CHD while the remaining genes (FEZ1, MYO16, ARID1B, NALCN, WAC, KDM5B and WHSC1) have only been associated in singletons and small cases series, or show new associations with CHD. In addition, a systems level analysis revealed shared contribution of CNV deletions and DNMs in CHD probands, affecting protein-protein interaction networks involved in Notch signaling pathway, heart morphogenesis, DNA repair and cilia/centrosome function. Taken together, this approach highlights the importance of re-analyzing existing datasets to strengthen disease association and identify novel disease genes.",

    "abstract": "In humans, de novo recurrent copy number variations (CNVs) often arise during meiosis from non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between low copy repeat elements (LCRs). These chromosomal rearrangements are responsible for a wide variety of genomic disorders involving duplication or deletion of dose-sensitive genes. The precise factors that steer meiotic cells toward this detrimental recombination pathway are not fully understood. To create a model for the investigation of LCR-mediated CNV mechanisms, we developed a diploid experimental system in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We modified the right arm of chromosome V through the introduction of engineered LCRs: duplicated 5 to 35 kb segments of yeast DNA flanking single copy interstitial spacers, analogously to the meiotic NAHR substrates that exist in humans. Phenotypic markers, including a copy number reporter, were inserted within the interstitial spacer. Their segregation in the haploid meiotic progeny was used to phenotypically identity and classify recurrent CNV events. This system allowed us to measure the effects of LCR size on the frequency of meiotic de novo recurrent CNV formation, and to determine the relative proportions of each of the three main NAHR classes: interhomolog, intersister, and intrachromatid. The frequency of CNV increased as the LCRs became larger, and interhomolog NAHR was overrepresented relative to the two other classes. We showed that this experimental system directly mimics the features of de novo recurrent CNVs reported in human disease, thus it represents a promising tool for the discovery and characterization of conserved cellular factors and environmental exposures that can modulate meiotic NAHR.",
