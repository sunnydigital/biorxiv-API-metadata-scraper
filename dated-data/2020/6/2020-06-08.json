    "abstract": "LINE-1 mediated retrotransposition of protein-coding mRNAs is an active process in modern humans for both germline and somatic genomes. Prior works that surveyed human data or human cohorts mostly relied on detecting discordant mappings of paired-end short reads, or assumed L1 hallmarks such as polyA tails and target site duplications. Moreover, there has been few genome-wide comparison between gene retrocopies in great apes and humans. In this study, we introduced a more sensitive and accurate approach to the discovery of processed pseudogene. Our method utilizes long read assemblies, and more importantly, is able to provide full retrocopy sequences as well as the neighboring sequences which are missed by short-read based methods reads. We provided an overview of novel gene retrocopies of 40 events (38 parent genes) in 20 human assemblies, a significantly higher discovery rate than previous reports (39 events of 36 parent genes out of 939 individuals). We also performed comprehensive analysis of lineage specific retrocopies in chimpanzee, gorilla and orangutan genomes.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTThe Human Cell Atlas (HCA) is a large project that aims to identify all cell types in the human body. The dimension reduction and clustering for identification of cell types from single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) data have become foundational approaches to HCA. The major challenges of current computational analyses are of poor performance on large scale data and sensitive to initial data. We present a new ensemble framework called Adaptive Slice KNNs (scASK) to address the challenges for analysing scRNA-seq data with high dimensionality. scASK consists of three innovational modules, called DAS (Data Adaptive Slicing), MCS (Meta Classifiers Selecting) and EMS (Ensemble Mode Switching), respectively, which facilitate scASK to approximate a bias-variance tradeoff beyond classification. Thirteen real scRNA-seq datasets are used to evaluate the performance of scASK. Compared with five popular classification algorithms, our experimental results indicate that scASK achieves the best accuracy and robustness among all competing methods. In conclusion, adaptive slicing is an effective structural reduction procedure, and meanwhile scASK provides novel and robust ensemble framework especially for classifying cell types based on scRNA-seq data. scASK is publically available at https://github.com/liubo2358/scASKcmd.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death for women worldwide. Patients whose tumors express Estrogen Receptor  (ER) account for around 70% of cases and are mostly treated with targeted endocrine therapy. However, 40% of these tumors eventually relapse due to resistance development and further treatment of these patients is highly ineffective. In this study we profiled the early phases of the resistance development process to uncover drivers of this phenomenon. Time-resolved analysis revealed that ATF3, a member of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors, acts as a novel regulator of the response to therapy via rewiring of central signaling processes towards the adaptation to endocrine treatment. ATF3 was found to be essential in controlling crucial processes such as proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis during the early response to treatment through the regulation of MAPK/AKT signaling pathways. Its essential role was confirmed in vivo in a mouse model and elevated expression of ATF3 was verified in patient datasets, adding clinical relevance to our findings. This study proposes ATF3 as a novel mediator of endocrine resistance development in breast cancer and elucidates its role in the regulation of downstream pathways activities.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic divisions depend on the timely assembly and proper orientation of the mitotic spindle. Malfunctioning of these processes can considerably delay mitosis, thereby compromising tissue growth and homeostasis, and leading to chromosomal instability. Here we identified Mms19 as an important player in these processes as it promotes spindle and astral microtubule (MT) growth and consequently regulates spindle orientation and mitosis duration in Drosophila neural stem cells. Loss of functional Mms19 drastically affects the growth and development of mitotic tissues in Drosophila larvae. We found that Mms19 performs its mitotic activities through two different pathways. By stimulating the mitotic kinase cascade, it triggers the localization of the MT regulatory complex TACC/Msps (Transforming Acidic Coiled Coil/Minispindles, the homolog of human ch-TOG) to the centrosome. In addition, we present evidence that Mms19 stimulates MT stability and bundling by binding directly to MTs.",

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin maintains genome integrity and function, and is organised into distinct nuclear domains. Some of these domains are proposed to form by phase separation through the accumulation of HP1. Mammalian heterochromatin contains noncoding major satellite repeats (MSR), which are highly transcribed in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Here, we report that MSR transcripts can drive the formation of HP1 droplets in vitro, and scaffold heterochromatin into dynamic condensates in ESCs, leading to the formation of large nuclear domains that are characteristic of pluripotent cells. Depleting MSR transcripts causes heterochromatin to transition into a more compact and static state. Unexpectedly, changing heterochromatins biophysical properties has severe consequences for ESCs, including chromosome instability and mitotic defects. These findings uncover an essential role for MSR transcripts in modulating the organisation and properties of heterochromatin to preserve genome stability. They also provide new insights into the processes that could regulate phase separation and the functional consequences of disrupting the properties of heterochromatin condensates.",

    "abstract": "For many pollinators, flowers provide predictable temporal schedules of resource availability, meaning an ability to learn time-dependent information could be widely beneficial. However, this ability has only been demonstrated in a handful of species. Observational studies of Heliconius butterflies suggest that they may have an ability to form time-dependent foraging preferences. Heliconius are unique among butterflies in actively collecting and digesting pollen, a dietary behaviour linked to spatiotemporally faithful \u2018trap-line\u2019 foraging. Time-dependency of foraging preferences is hypothesised to allow Heliconius to exploit temporal predictability in alternative pollen resources, as well as contributing to optimal use of learnt foraging routes. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence in support of this hypothesis, demonstrating that Heliconius hecale can learn opposing colour preferences in two time periods. This shift in preference is robust to the order of presentation, suggesting that preference is tied to the time of day and not due to ordinal learning. However, we also show that this ability is not limited to Heliconius, as previously hypothesised, but is also present in a related genus of non-pollen feeding butterflies. This demonstrates that time learning pre-dates the origin of pollen-feeding and may be prevalent across butterflies with less specialized foraging behaviours.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

A vaccine to protect against this disease does not exist so transmission control relies on eliminating tsetse populations. Although neurotoxic insecticides are the gold standard for insect control, they negatively impact the environment and reduce insect pollinator species. Here we present a promising, environment-friendly alternative that targets insect tyrosine metabolism pathway. A bloodmeal contains high levels of tyrosine, which is toxic to haematophagous insects if it is not degraded. RNAi silencing of either the first two enzymes in the tyrosine degradation pathway (TAT and HPPD) was lethal to tsetse. Furthermore, nitisinone (NTBC), an FDA-approved tyrosine catabolism inhibitor, killed tsetse regardless if the drug was orally or topically applied. However, it did not affect bumblebee survival. A mathematical model shows that NTBC could reduce the transmission of African trypanosomiasis in sub-Saharan Africa, thus accelerating current elimination programmes.",

    "abstract": "Glutamylation, introduced by TTLL enzymes, is the most abundant modification of brain tubulin. Essential effector proteins read the tubulin glutamylation pattern, and its misregulation causes neurodegeneration. TTLL glutamylases posttranslationally add glutamates to internal glutamates in tubulin C-terminal tails (branch initiation, through an isopeptide bond), and additional glutamates can extend these (elongation). TTLLs are thought to specialize for initiation or elongation, but the mechanistic basis for regioselectivity is unknown. We present cocrystal structures of murine TTLL6 bound to tetrahedral intermediate analogs that delineate key active-site residues that make this an elongase. We show that TTLL4 is exclusively an initiase, and through combined structural and phylogenetic analyses, engineer TTLL6 into a branch-initiating enzyme. TTLL glycylases add glycines posttranslationally to internal glutamates, and we find that the same active-site residues discriminate between initiase and elongase glycylases. These active-site specializations of TTLL glutamylases and glycylases ultimately yield the chemical complexity of cellular microtubules.",

    "abstract": "Organic farming systems are generally based on intensive soil tillage for seed bed preparation and weed control, which in the long-term often leads to reduced soil fertility. To avoid this, organic farming systems need to adopt conservation agriculture practices, such as minimum tillage and diligent crop rotations. However, minimum tillage generally delays soil warming in spring causing reduced nitrogen mineralization and thus poor plant growth. This negative effect needs to be compensated. We hypothesize that, in a diverse crop rotation, organic minimum tillage based on frequent cover cropping and application of dead mulch will improve soil fertility and thus crop production as confirmed by a number of chemical and biological soil indicators.\n\nWe made use of two long-term field experiments that compare typical organic plough-based systems (25 cm) with minimum tillage systems (<15 cm) including application of transfer mulch to potatoes. Both tillage systems were either fertilized with compost or equivalent amounts of mineral potassium and phosphate. In 2019, soil samples from both fields were collected and analyzed for soil pH, organic carbon, macro-, micronutrients, microbial biomass, microbial activity and total nematode abundance. In addition, performance of pea in the same soils was determined under greenhouse conditions.\n\nResults from the field experiments showed an increase of macronutrients (+52%), micronutrients (+11%), microbial biomass (+51%), microbial activity (+86%), and bacterivorous nematodes (+112%) in minimum tillage compared with the plough-based system. In the accompanying greenhouse bioassay, pea biomass was 45% higher under minimum than under plough tillage. In conclusion, the study showed that under organic conditions, soil fertility can be improved in minimum tillage systems by intensive cover cropping and application of dead mulch to levels higher than in a plough-based system. Furthermore, the abundance of bacterivorous nematodes can be used as a reliable indicator for the soil fertility status.",

    "abstract": "In agroecosystems, anthropogenic activities can modify the natural dispersal capacity of crops and their capacity to establish feral populations. In the case of oilseed rape (OSR), seed spillage from grain trailers during harvest was first quantified by an in situ scientific study (Selommes, Loir-et-Cher, France). Demographic analysis of seeds collected from 85 traps set on road verges suggested that OSR dispersal distance due to seed spillage from grain trailers can be up to 400m. In the present study, we used SSR markers to genotype seeds collected from trap-sites and from surrounding OSR fields to precisely estimate the distances between traps and fields. Trailer directions on each road were also considered. Few seeds (5.8%) were not linked to a field in the studied area, while most of the seeds (59.2%) were linked to a field situated over 400 m away. The overall mean dispersal distance was 1250 m. It ranged from 308 m to 1392 m for one-lane roads, and from 1048 m to 1404 m for two-lane roads. Events of seed dispersal at greater distances (> 5 km) were rare but still possible. It thus follows that OSR seed dispersal due to spillage from grain trailers should be carefully considered in the context of genetically modified plant cultivation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNearly all Eurasians have [~]2% Neanderthal ancestry due to several events of inbreeding between anatomically modern humans and archaic hominins. Previous studies characterizing the legacy of Neanderthal ancestry in modern Eurasians have identified examples of both adaptive and deleterious effects of admixture. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of the genome-wide influence of Neanderthal introgression on modern human diseases and traits.\n\nResultsWe integrate recent maps of Neanderthal ancestry with well-powered association studies for more than 400 diverse traits to estimate heritability enrichment patterns in regions of the human genome tolerant of Neanderthal ancestry and in introgressed Neanderthal variants themselves. First, we find that variants in regions tolerant of Neanderthal ancestry are depleted of heritability for all traits considered, except skin and hair-related traits. Second, the introgressed variants remaining in modern Europeans are depleted of heritability for most traits; however, we discover that they are enriched for heritability of several traits with potential relevance to human adaptation to non-African environments, including hair and skin traits, autoimmunity, chronotype, bone density, lung capacity, and menopause age. To better understand the phenotypic consequences of these enrichments, we adapt recent methods to test for consistent directional effects of introgressed alleles, and we find directionality for several traits. Finally, we use a direction-of-effect-aware approach to highlight novel candidate introgressed variants that influence risk for disease.\n\nConclusionOur results demonstrate that genomic regions retaining Neanderthal ancestry are not only less functional at the molecular-level, but are also depleted for variation influencing a diverse array of complex traits in modern humans. In spite of this depletion, we identify traits where introgression has an outsized effect. Integrating our results, we propose a framework for using quantification of trait heritability and direction of effect in introgressed regions to understand how Neanderthals were different from modern humans, how selection acted on different traits, and how introgression may have facilitated adaptation to non-African environments.",

    "abstract": "There is substantial experimental evidence to indicate that Leishmania infections that are transmitted naturally by the bites of infected sand flies differ in fundamental ways from the inflammatory and immune reactions initiated by needle inocula. We have used flow cytometry and intravital microscopy (IVM) to reveal the heterogeneity of sand fly transmission sites with respect to the subsets of phagocytes in the skin that harbor L. major within the first hours and days after infection. By flow cytometry analysis, dermis resident macrophages (TRMs) were on average the predominant infected cell type at 1 hr and 24 hr. By confocal IVM, the co-localization of L. major and neutrophils varied depending on the proximity of deposited parasites to the presumed site of vascular damage, defined by the highly localized swarming of neutrophils. Some of the dermal TRMs could be visualized acquiring their infections via transfer from or efferocytosis of parasitized neutrophils, providing direct evidence for the \"Trojan Horse\" model. The role of neutrophil engulfment by dermal TRMs and the involvement of the Tyro3/Axl/Mertk family of receptor tyrosine kinases in these interactions and in sustaining the anti-inflammatory program of dermal TRMs was supported by the effects observed in neutrophil depleted and in Axl-/-Mertk-/- mice. The Axl-/-Mertk-/- mice also displayed reduced parasite burdens but more severe pathology following L. major infection transmitted by sand fly bite.\n\nSummarySand flies transmit Leishmania major which causes cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans and in non-human hosts. Our analyses of sand fly transmission sites of L. major in the mouse skin revealed that dermis resident macrophages (TRM) were the predominant phagocytes to take up the parasite within the first 24 hr post-bite. The early involvement of neutrophils varied depending on the proximity of deposited parasites to the site of tissue damage around which the neutrophils coalesced. By intra-vital microscopy, some of the dermal TRMs could be visualized acquiring their infections by direct transfer from or phagocytosis of parasitized neutrophils. The involvement of the Tyro3/Axl/Mertk family of receptor tyrosine kinases in these cellular interactions and in sustaining the anti-inflammatory functions of dermal TRMs was supported by the reduced parasite burdens but more severe pathology observed in Axl-/-Mertk-/- mice. The heterogeneity of sand fly transmission sites with respect to the dose of parasites and the early cellular interactions described here likely contribute to the wide range of infection outcomes that are associated with natural transmission of L. major observed in mouse models and possibly humans.",

    "abstract": "Endophytes play an important role in plant growth and development. Some one can produce auxins, ACCs, iron carriers, and so on to help plants grow and resist unhealthy growth environments. In addition, they can produce certain antimicrobial substances to resist pests and diseases. Among them, Bacillus is the most common beneficial endophytic bacterium in plants. In this paper, 20 IAA-producing strains were screened from endophytic bacteria isolated from Taxus chinensis var. mairei plant tissues by high-performance liquid-chromatography (HPLC). Based on the 20 IAA-producing strains, LC-TOF-MS technology was used to screen lipopeptide-producing Bacillus sp. As a result, three strains (KLBMPTC01, KLBMPTC10, and KLBMPTC29) of Bacillus-producing lipopeptides with abundant contents and species were obtained. According to the situation of the IAA and lipopeptides produced by these strains, KLBMPTC10 was selected as the experimental strain for later toxicological tests. In an Ames test and oral toxicity experiments in mice, we did not detect mutagenicity and other physiological toxicity. This is hoping to provide a theoretical basis for forest resource protection and biofertiliser production therewith.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications regulate gene expression in the host response to a diverse range of pathogens. The extent and consequences of epigenetic modification during macrophage responses to Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the role of pneumolysin, a key Streptococcus pneumoniae virulence factor, in influencing these responses, are currently unknown. To investigate this, we infected human monocyte derived macrophages (MDMs) with Streptococcus pneumoniae and addressed whether pneumolysin altered the epigenetic landscape and the associated acute macrophage transcriptional response using a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach. Transcriptomic analysis identified 503 genes that were differentially expressed in a pneumolysin-dependent manner in these samples. Pathway analysis highlighted the involvement of transcriptional responses to core innate responses to pneumococci including modules associated with metabolic pathways activated in response to infection, oxidative stress responses and NF{kappa}B, NOD-like receptor and TNF signalling pathways. Quantitative proteomic analysis confirmed pneumolysin-regulated protein expression, early after bacterial challenge, in representative transcriptional modules associated with innate immune responses. In parallel, quantitative mass spectrometry identified global changes in the relative abundance of histone post translational modifications (PTMs) upon pneumococcal challenge. We identified an increase in the relative abundance of H3K4me1, H4K16ac and a decrease in H3K9me2 and H3K79me2 in a PLY-dependent fashion. We confirmed that pneumolysin blunted early transcriptional responses involving TNF- and IL-6 expression. Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, similarly downregulated TNF production, reprising the pattern observed with pneumolysin. In conclusion, widespread changes in the macrophage transcriptional response are regulated by pneumolysin and are associated with global changes in histone PTMs. Modulating histone PTMs can reverse pneumolysin-associated transcriptional changes influencing innate immune responses, suggesting that epigenetic modification by pneumolysin plays a role in dampening the innate responses to pneumococci.\n\nAuthor summaryPneumolysin is a toxin that contributes to how Streptococcus pneumoniae, the leading cause of pneumonia, causes disease. In this study, the toxin alters gene expression in immune cells called macrophages, one of the first lines of defence against bacteria at sites of infection. Modulation involved multiple immune responses, including generation of chemical signals coordinating responses in immune cells termed cytokines. In addition, changes were observed in histone proteins that are involved in controlling gene expression in the cell. Pneumolysin reduced early production of the cytokine TNF- and a medicine vorinostat that modifies these  epigenetic histone modifications had a similar affect, suggesting epigenetic mechanisms contribute to the ability of pneumolysin to reduce immune responses.",

    "abstract": "The fast Fourier transform (FFT), has been the main tool for the EEG spectral analysis (SPA). However, as the EEG dynamics shows nonlinear and non-stationary behavior, results using the FFT approach may result meaningless. A novel method has been developed for the analysis of nonlinear and non-stationary signals known as the Hilbert-Huang transform method. In this study we describe and compare the spectral analyses of the EEG using the traditional FFT approach with those calculated with the Hilbert marginal spectra (HMS) after decomposition of the EEG with a multivariate empirical mode decomposition algorithm. Segments of continuous 60-seconds EEG recorded from 19 leads of 47 healthy volunteers were studied. Although the spectral indices calculated for the explored EEG bands showed significant statistical differences for different leads and bands, a detailed analysis showed that for practical purposes both methods performed substantially similar. The HMS showed a reduction of the alpha activity (-5.64%), with increment in the beta-1 (+1.67%), and gamma (+1.38%) fast activity bands, and also an increment in the theta band (+2.14%), and in the delta (+0.45%) band, and vice versa for the FFT method. For the weighted mean frequencies insignificant mean differences (lower than 1Hz) were observed between both methods for the delta, theta, alpha, beta-1 and beta-2 bands, and only for the gamma band values for the HMS were 3 Hz higher than with the FFT method. The HMS may be considered a good alternative for the SPA of the EEG when nonlinearity or non-stationarity may be present.",

    "abstract": "People balance the benefits of cognitive work against the costs of cognitive effort. Models that incorporate prospective estimates of the costs of cognitive effort into decision making require a mechanism by which these costs are learned. However, it remains open what brain systems are important for this learning, particularly when learning is not tied explicitly to a decision about what task to perform. In this fMRI experiment, we parametrically manipulated the level of effort a task requires by increasing task switching frequency across six task contexts. In a scanned learning phase, participants implicitly learned about the task switching frequency in each context. In a subsequent test phase, participants made selections between pairs of these task contexts. We modeled learning within a reinforcement learning framework, and found that effort expectations that derived from task-switching probability and response time (RT) during learning were the best predictors of later choice behavior. Prediction errors (PE) from these two models were associated with FPN during distinct learning epochs. Specifically, PE derived from expected RT was most correlated with the fronto-parietal network early in learning, whereas PE derived from expected task switching frequency was correlated with the fronto-parietal network late in learning. These results suggest that multiple task-related factors are tracked by the brain while performing a task that can drive subsequent estimates of effort costs.",

Here, we use an -synuclein-overexpressing transgenic (Th-1-SNCA-A30P) mouse model of PD to identify appropriate candidate markers in the gut for early stages of PD before hallmark symptoms begin to manifest. A30P mice did not show alterations in gait parameters at 2 months of age, and these mice were therefore defined as pre-symptomatic A30P mice (psA30P). We discovered early functional motility changes in the gut and early molecular dysregulations in the myenteric plexus of psA30P mice by comparative protein and miRNA profiling and cell culture experiments. We found that the proteins neurofilament light chain, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 and calbindin 2, together with the miRNAs that regulate them, are potential biomarkers of early PD that may facilitate timely treatment and/or prevention of PD in men.",

    "abstract": "Crowding, the failure to identify a peripheral item in clutter, is an essential bottleneck in visual information processing. A hallmark characteristic of crowding is the inner-outer asymmetry in which the outer flanker (more eccentric) produces stronger interference than the inner one (closer to the fovea). We tested the contribution of the inner-outer asymmetry to the pattern of crowding errors in a typical radial crowding display in which both flankers are presented simultaneously on the horizontal meridian. In two experiments, observers were asked to estimate the orientation of a Gabor target. Instead of the target, observers reported the outer flanker much more frequently than the inner one. When the target was the outer Gabor, crowding was reduced. Furthermore, when there were four flankers, two on each side of the target, observers misreported the outer flanker adjacent to the target, not the outermost flanker. Model comparisons suggested that orientation crowding reflects sampling over a weighted sum of the represented features, in which the outer flanker is more heavily weighted compared to the inner one. Our findings reveal a counterintuitive phenomenon: in a radial arrangement of orientation crowding, within a region of selection, the outer item dominates appearance more than the inner one.",

    "abstract": "Strawberry (Fragaria xananassa) is an economically important high-value crop that is susceptible to three most devastating pathogens with different lifestyles - a necrotrophic fungus Botrytis cinerea causing grey mold, a hemibiotrophic oomycete Phytophthora cactorum causing crown/root rot, and a biotrophic fungus Podosphaera aphanis causing powdery mildew. Studies on individual plant-pathogen interactions are only sufficient for developing disease resistant strawberry varieties to a particular pathogen. However, each of these pathogens have the potential to co-infect strawberry at a given point of time. Therefore, understanding how these pathogens manipulate strawberrys defences and how it responds to these pathogens is essential for developing broad-spectrum disease resistant varieties. Here, in the diploid model Fragaria vesca, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis between each of these pathogen infections to identify 501 Common Responsive (CoRe) genes targeted against these pathogens. Furthermore, about 80% of these CoRe set are upregulated upon infection by all three pathogens indicating a similar transcriptional response of F. vesca independent of pathogens lifestyle. These upregulated CoRe set include genes from well-known defence responsive pathways such as calcium and MAP kinase signalling, WRKY transcription factors, pathogenesis-related allergen genes and hormone and terpene biosynthetic genes. These novel insights into F. vescas defences might serve as a basis for engineering plants with broad spectrum resistance.",

Morphologically and ecologically, Microgramma presents a wide variation that is not seen in its closest related genera. Recent works changed the circumscription of Microgramma to better conform with phylogenetic evidence, but no comprehensively sampled study has addressed the evolution of this lineage. This study aimed to investigate phylogenetic relationships, ecological and morphological evolution within Microgramma, as well as test the role of long-distant dispersal in the history of the genus. Sequences from five plastid regions were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships and estimate divergence times. Our results show five clades in Microgramma that do not corroborate any infrageneric classification system proposed. Several morphological traits seem to be homoplastic, such as leaf dimorphism. Tuber-like myrmecodomatia are suggested to be synapomorphic for one clade, although ant-plant association appears in two distinct lineages. Microgramma lycopodioides and M. mauritiana are not closely related, with the African species nested within an Atlantic Forest clade, indicating a long-distance dispersal event estimated to have occurred around 15 Ma from South America to Africa, followed by speciation.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescently-quenched probes that are specifically activated in the cancer microenvironment have great potential application for diagnosis, early detection and surgical guidance. These probes are often designed to target specific enzymes associated with disease by direct optimization using single purified targets. However, this can result in painstaking chemistry efforts to produce a probe with suboptimal performance when applied in vivo. We describe here an alternate, unbiased activity-profiling approach in which whole tissue extracts are used to directly identify optimal peptide sequences for probe design. Screening of mouse mammary tumor extracts with a hybrid combinatorial substrate library (HyCoSuL) identified a combination of natural and non-natural amino acid residues that could be used to generate highly efficient tumor-specific fluorescently quenched substrate probes. The most effective probe is significantly brighter than any of our previously reported tumor imaging probes designed for specific proteases and robustly discriminates tumor tissue from adjacent healthy tissue in a mouse model of cancer. Importantly, although the probes were developed by screening mouse mammary tumor tissues, they are able to effectively distinguish human ductal carcinomas from normal breast tissue with similar reactivity profiles to those observed in mouse tissues. This new strategy simplifies and enhances the process of probe optimization by direct screening in a tissue of interest without any a priori knowledge of enzyme targets. It has the potential to be applied to advance the development of probes for diverse disease states for which clinical or animal model tissues are available.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSystems-level analyses, such as differential gene expression analysis, co-expression analysis, and metabolic pathway reconstruction, depend on the accuracy of the transcriptome. Multiple tools exist to perform transcriptome assembly from RNAseq data. However, assembling high quality transcriptomes is still not a trivial problem. This is especially the case for non-model organisms where adequate reference genomes are often not available. Different methods produce different transcriptome models and there is no easy way to determine which are more accurate. Furthermore, having alternative-splicing events exacerbates such difficult assembly problems. While benchmarking transcriptome assemblies is critical, this is also not trivial due to the general lack of true reference transcriptomes.\n\nResultsIn this study, we first provide a pipeline to generate a set of the benchmark transcriptome and corresponding RNAseq data. Using the simulated benchmarking datasets, we compared the performance of various transcriptome assembly approaches including both de novo and genome-guided methods. The results showed that the assembly performance deteriorates significantly when alternative transcripts (isoforms) exist or for genome-guided methods when the reference is not available from the same genome. To improve the transcriptome assembly performance, leveraging the overlapping predictions between different assemblies, we present a new consensus-based ensemble transcriptome assembly approach, ConSemble.\n\nConclusionsWithout using a reference genome, ConSemble using four de novo assemblers achieved an accuracy up to twice as high as any de novo assemblers we compared. When a reference genome is available, ConSemble using four genome-guided assemblies removed many incorrectly assembled contigs with minimal impact on correctly assembled contigs, achieving higher precision and accuracy than individual genome-guided methods. Furthermore, ConSemble using de novo assemblers matched or exceeded the best performing genome-guided assemblers even when the transcriptomes included isoforms. We thus demonstrated that the ConSemble consensus strategy both for de novo and genome-guided assemblers can improve transcriptome assembly. The RNAseq simulation pipeline, the benchmark transcriptome datasets, and the script to perform the ConSemble assembly are all freely available from: http://bioinfolab.unl.edu/emlab/consemble/.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWRab5 is required for macropinosome formation, but its site and mode of action remain unknown. We report that Rab5 acts at the plasma membrane, downstream of ruffling, to promote macropinosome sealing and scission. Dominant-negative Rab5, which obliterates macropinocytosis, had no effect on the development of membrane ruffles. However, Rab5-containing vesicles were recruited to circular membrane ruffles, and SNARE-dependent endomembrane fusion was necessary for completion of macropinocytosis. This fusion event coincided with the disappearance of PtdIns(4,5)P2 that accompanies macropinosome closure. Counteracting the depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P2 by expression of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase impaired macropinosome formation. Importantly, we found that removal of PtdIns(4,5)P2 is dependent on Rab5, through the Rab5-mediated recruitment of the inositol 5-phosphatases OCRL and Inpp5b, via APPL1. Knockdown of OCRL and Inpp5b, or APPL1 prevented macropinosome closure, without affecting ruffling. We therefore propose that Rab5 is essential for the clearance of PtdIns(4,5)P2 needed to complete macropinosome scission from the plasmalemma.",

    "abstract": "Equipartitioning by chromosome hitchhiking and copy number correction by DNA amplification are at the heart of the evolutionary success of the selfish yeast 2-micron plasmid. The present analysis reveals plasmid presence near centromeres and telomeres in mitotic cells, with a preference towards the latter. The observed correlation of plasmid missegregation with non-disjunction of rDNA and telomeres under Cdc14 inactivation, higher plasmid missegregation upon induced missegregation of chromosome XII but not chromosome III, requirement of condensin for plasmid stability and the interaction of the condensin subunit Brn1 with the plasmid partitioning system lend functional credence to condensed chromatin being favored for plasmid tethering. By homing to condensed/quiescent chromosome locales, and not over-perturbing genome homeostasis, the plasmid may minimize fitness conflicts with its host. Analogous persistence strategies may be utilized by other extrachromosomal selfish genomes, for example, episomes of mammalian viruses that also hitchhike on host chromosomes for their stable maintenance.",

    "abstract": "We demonstrate that it is possible to draw direct numerical correlations between virus particles and effective virus-like particle (VLP) derived vaccines through extraction of a Bragg-Williams order parameter from electron microscopy. The method has its roots in studies of disorder in metal alloys, and is adapted to describe the type and occurrence of structural motifs within the arrangement of viral coat proteins, captured by the value of the order parameter as a measure of disorder. A conventional approach to viral vaccine design consists of replicating select proteins to create a VLP designed to trigger an immune response while remaining non-infectious. Understanding variations between viruses and vaccine strains therefore tends to focus on differences between proteins, which can be characterized through genetic analysis. While such an approach provides vital information about the functioning and interactions of the proteins, it does not yet yield an early-stage pathway towards predicting the efficacy of a vaccine, and so large-scale clinical trials are required to obtain critical information. With the urgency associated with pandemics, including Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) originating from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, there is a need for earlier indications of whether a vaccine has the necessary characteristics. Application of the methodology to Dengue and influenza virus particles indicates that temperature and pH during incubation could potentially be exploited to fine-tune the order parameter of VLP-based vaccines to match the corresponding virus. Additionally, utilization of an Ising model plot reveals a clear relationship between case fatality rate and order parameter for distinct virus families.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDrugs affecting neuromodulation, for example by dopamine or acetylcholine, take centre stage among therapeutic strategies in psychiatry. These neuromodulators can change both neuronal gain and synaptic plasticity and therefore affect electrophysiological measures. An important goal for clinical diagnostics is to exploit this effect in the reverse direction, i.e., to infer the status of specific neuromodulatory systems from electrophysiological measures.\n\nIn this study, we provide proof-of-concept that the functional status of cholinergic (specifically muscarinic) receptors can be inferred from electrophysiological data using generative (dynamic causal) models. To this end, we used epidural EEG recordings over two auditory cortical regions during a mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm in rats. All animals were treated, across sessions, with muscarinic receptor agonists and antagonists at different doses. Together with a placebo condition, this resulted in five levels of muscarinic receptor status. Using a dynamic causal model - embodying a small network of coupled cortical microcircuits - we estimated synaptic parameters and their change across pharmacological conditions. The ensuing parameter estimates associated with (the neuromodulation of) synaptic efficacy showed both graded muscarinic effects and predictive validity between agonistic and antagonistic pharmacological conditions.\n\nThis finding illustrates the potential utility of generative models of electrophysiological data as computational assays of muscarinic function. In application to EEG data of patients from heterogeneous spectrum diseases, e.g. schizophrenia, such models might help identify subgroups of patients that respond differentially to cholinergic treatments.\n\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWTATEMENTC_SCPLOWIn psychiatry, the vast majority of pharmacological treatments affect actions of neuromodulatory transmitters, e.g. dopamine or acetylcholine. As treatment is largely trial-and-error based, one of the goals for computational psychiatry is to construct mathematical models that can serve as \"computational assays\" and infer the status of specific neuromodulatory systems in individual patients. This neuro-modelling strategy has great promise for electrophysiological data in particular but requires careful validation. The present study demonstrates that the functional status of cholinergic (muscarinic) receptors can be inferred from electrophysiological data using dynamic causal models of neural circuits. While accuracy needs to be enhanced and our results must be replicated in larger samples, our current results provide proof-of-concept for computational assays of muscarinic function using EEG.",

    "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a pathogen that causes severe vector-borne zoonotic diseases, thereby posing a serious threat to human health. Although JEV is potentially neurotropic, its pathogenesis and distribution in the host have not been fully elucidated. In this study, an infected mouse model was established using a highly virulent P3 strain of JEV. Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization, combined with anatomical imaging of the mouse brain, were used to dynamically localize the virus and construct three-dimensional (3D) images. Consequently, onset of mild clinical symptoms occurred in some mice at 84h post JEV infection, while most mice displayed typical neurological symptoms at 144h post infection. Moreover, brain pathology revealed typical changes associated with non-suppurative encephalitis, which lasted up to 192h. The earliest detection of viral antigen was achieved at 72h post infection, in the thalamus and medulla oblongata. At 144h post infection, the positive viral antigen signals were mainly distributed in the cerebral cortex, olfactory area, basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem regions in mice. At 192h post infection, the antigen signals gradually decreased, and the localization of JEV tended to concentrate in the cerebrum and thalamus, while no viral antigen was detected in the brain at 504h post infection. In this model, the viral antigen was first expressed in the reticular thalamic nucleus (Rt), at a consistent concentration. The expression of the viral antigen in the hippocampal CA2 region, the anterior olfactory nucleus, and the deep mesencephalic nucleus was high and persistent. The 3D images showed that viral signals were mostly concentrated in the parietal cortex, occipital lobe, and hippocampus, near the mid-sagittal plane. In the early stages of infection in mice, a large number of viral antigens were detected in denatured and necrotic neurons, suggesting that JEV directly causes neuronal damage. From the time of its entry, JEV is widely distributed in the central nervous system thereby causing extensive damage.Author summary There are many theories regarding the mechanism of entry of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) into the nervous system. The inflammation cascade effect, resulting from the virus entering the central nervous system (CNS), is a major cause of brain injury in JEV patients. In this study, we found that the earliest point at which viral antigen was detected in the brain tissues following peripheral infection of JEV was at 72h. The virus was located in the nerve nuclei of the thalamus and medulla oblongata and, subsequently, viral antigens were found in the anterior olfactory nucleus. At 96h post infection, the virus was extensively distributed in the brain tissue, and at 144h-192h the viral antigen was widely distributed and highly concentrated. The viral concentration detected in the ventromedial thalamic nucleus (VM), deep mesencephalic nucleus (DpMe), and motor trigeminal nucleus (Mo5) remained high throughout the experiment. The hypertrophic nerve nuclei of JEV include the early anterior olfactory (AO) nucleus and the late hippocampal CA2 region. In the early stages of viral infection (72-144h post infection), the changes in viral antigen concentration and mortality rate were consistent. It was hypothesized that this stage represents the activation of viral proliferation and brain inflammation.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "One of the earliest and most prevalent barriers to successful reproduction is polyspermy, or fertilization of an egg by multiple sperm. To prevent these supernumerary fertilizations, eggs have evolved multiple mechanisms. It has recently been proposed that zinc released by mammalian eggs at fertilization may block additional sperm from entering. Here, we demonstrate that eggs from amphibia and teleost fish also release zinc. Using Xenopus laevis as a model, we document that zinc reversibly blocks fertilization. Finally, we demonstrate that extracellular zinc similarly disrupts early embryonic development in eggs from diverse phyla, including: Cnidaria, Echinodermata, and Chordata. Our study reveals that a fundamental strategy protecting human eggs from fertilization by multiple sperm may have evolved more than 650 million years ago.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWith the gradual reopening of economies and resumption of social life, robust surveillance mechanisms should be implemented to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Unlike RT-qPCR, SARS-CoV-2 Whole Genome Sequencing (cWGS) has the added advantage of identifying cryptic origins of the virus, and the extent of community-based transmissions versus new viral introductions, which can in turn influence public health policy decisions. However, practical and cost considerations of cWGS should be addressed before it can be widely implemented.\n\nMethodsWe performed shotgun transcriptome sequencing using RNA extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs of patients with COVID-19, and compared it to targeted SARS-CoV-2 full genome amplification and sequencing with respect to virus detection, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. To track virus origin, we used open-source multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic tools to compare the assembled SARS-CoV-2 genomes to publicly available sequences.\n\nResultsWe show a significant improvement in whole genome sequencing data quality and viral detection using amplicon-based target enrichment of SARS-CoV-2. With enrichment, more than 99% of the sequencing reads mapped to the viral genome compared to an average of 0.63% without enrichment. Consequently, a dramatic increase in genome coverage was obtained using significantly less sequencing data, enabling higher scalability and significant cost reductions. We also demonstrate how SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences can be used to determine their possible origin through phylogenetic analysis including other viral strains.\n\nConclusionsSARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequencing is a practical, cost-effective, and powerful approach for population-based surveillance and control of viral transmission in the next phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Functions of the gut microbiome have a growing number of implications for host metabolic health, with diet being one of the most significant influences on microbiome composition. Compelling links between diet and the gut microbiome suggest key roles for various macronutrients, including lipids, yet how individual classes of dietary lipids interact with the microbiome remain largely unknown. A class of lipids known as sphingolipids are bioactive components of most foods and are produced by prominent gut microbes. This makes sphingolipids intriguing candidates for shaping diet-microbiome interactions. Here, we use a click-chemistry based approach to track the incorporation of bioorthogonal dietary omega-alkynyl sphinganine (sphinganine alkyne - SAA) into the gut microbial community (Click). Identification of microbe and SAA-specific metabolic products was achieved by fluorescence-based sorting of SAA containing microbes (Sort), 16S rRNA gene sequencing to identify the sphingolipid-interacting microbes (Seq), and comparative metabolomics to identify products of SAA assimilation by the microbiome (Spec). Together this approach, Click-Sort-Seq-Spec (ClickSSS), revealed that SAA-assimilation was nearly exclusively performed by gut Bacteroides, indicating that sphingolipid-producing bacteria play a major role in processing dietary sphinganine. Comparative metabolomics of cecal microbiota from SAA-treated mice showed conversion of SAA to a suite of dihydroceramides, consistent with metabolic activity via Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium. Additionally, other sphingolipid-interacting microbes were identified with a focus on an uncharacterized ability of Bacteroides and Bifidobacterium to metabolize dietary sphingolipids. Therefore, ClickSSS provides a platform to study the flux of virtually any alkyne-labeled metabolite in diet-microbiome interactions.",

To determine whether the renin-angiotensin inhibition regulates ACE2 expression, either enalapril (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) or losartan (an AT1 receptor blocker) was infused subcutaneously to male C57BL/6J mice for two weeks. Neither enalapril nor losartan changed abundance of ACE2 mRNA in lung, ileum, kidney, and heart. Viral entry also depends on transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) to prime the S protein. TMPRSS2 mRNA was abundant in lungs and ileum, modest in kidney, but barely detectable in heart. TMPRSS2 mRNA abundance was not altered by either enalapril or losartan in any of the 4 tissues. Next, we determined whether depletion of angiotensinogen (AGT), the unique substrate of the renin-angiotensin system, changes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA abundance. AGT antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) were injected subcutaneously to male C57BL/6J mice for 3 weeks.

However, the molecular mechanism by which TDP-43 aggregates form and cause neurodegeneration remains poorly understood. Cyclophilin A, also known as peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPIA), is a foldase and molecular chaperone. We previously found that PPIA interacts with TDP-43 and governs some of its functions, and its deficiency accelerates disease in a mouse model of ALS. Here we characterized PPIA knock-out mice throughout their lifespan and found that they develop a neurodegenerative disease with key behavioural features of FTD, marked TDP-43 pathology and late-onset motor dysfunction. In the mouse brain, deficient PPIA induces aggregation of the GTP-binding nuclear protein Ran, a PPIA substrate required for TDP-43 nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Moreover, in absence of PPIA, TDP-43 autoregulation is perturbed and TDP-43 and proteins involved in synaptic function are downregulated, leading to impairment of synaptic plasticity. Finally, we found that PPIA was downregulated in several ALS and ALS-FTD patients and identified a PPIA loss-of-function mutation in a sporadic ALS patient. The mutant PPIA has low stability, altered structure and impaired interaction with TDP-43. These findings strongly implicate that defective PPIA function causes TDP-43 mislocalization and dysfunction and should be considered in future therapeutic approaches.",

Here, we show how the insect hormone Bursicon coordinates the selection and sustains execution of a behavior in newly emerged adult Drosophila. Such flies must expand and harden their wings after metamorphosis, but they choose to delay expansion in confined conditions. We show that the decision to expand is mediated by an environmentally-sensitive, positive feedback loop in which Bursicon promotes its own sustained release.

    "abstract": "An ever-increasing number of intracellular multi-protein networks have been identified in plant cells. Split-GFP based protein-protein interaction assays combine the advantages of in vivo interaction studies in a native environment with additional visualisation of protein complex localisation. Due to its simple protocols, it has become one of the most frequently used methods. However, standard fluorescent proteins entail several drawbacks for sophisticated microscopy.\n\nWith the HaloTag(R) system, these drawbacks can be overcome as this reporter forms covalent irreversible bonds with synthetic photostable fluorescent ligands. Dyes can be used in adjustable concentrations and are suitable for advanced microscopy methods. Therefore, we established the Split-HaloTag(R) imaging assay in plants which is based on the reconstitution of a functional HaloTag(R) protein upon protein-protein interaction and subsequent covalent binding of an added fluorescent ligand. Its suitability and robustness were demonstrated using well-characterised interactions as an example for protein-protein interaction at cellular structures: the molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis complex anchoring to filamentous actin. Additionally, a specific interaction was visualised with subdiffractional polarisation microscopy in a more distinctive manner as example for sophisticated imaging.\n\nSplit-GFP and Split-HaloTag(R) can complement one another as Split-HaloTag(R) represents an alternative option and an addition to the large toolbox of in vivo methods. Therefore, this promising new Split-HaloTag(R) imaging assay provides a unique and sensitive approach for more detailed characterization of protein-protein interaction with specific microscopic techniques such as 3D-imaging, single molecule tracking and super-resolution microscopy.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization. As of the 31st of May, 2020, there have been more than 6 million COVID-19 cases diagnosed worldwide and over 370,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. Thousands of SARS-CoV-2 strains have been sequenced to date, providing a valuable opportunity to investigate the evolution of the virus on a global scale. We performed a phylogenetic analysis of over 1,225 SARS-CoV-2 genomes spanning from late December 2019 to mid-March 2020. We identified a missense mutation, D614G, in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, which has emerged as a predominant clade in Europe (954 of 1,449 (66%) sequences) and is spreading worldwide (1,237 of 2,795 (44%) sequences). Molecular dating analysis estimated the emergence of this clade around mid-to-late January (10 - 25 January) 2020. We also applied structural bioinformatics to assess D614G potential impact on the virulence and epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. In silico analyses on the spike protein structure suggests that the mutation is most likely neutral to protein function as it relates to its interaction with the human ACE2 receptor. The lack of clinical metadata available prevented our investigation of association between viral clade and disease severity phenotype. Future work that can leverage clinical outcome data with both viral and human genomic diversity is needed to monitor the pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related death globally. Resistance to standard of care endocrine treatment occurs in at least 30% of ER+ breast cancer patients resulting in ~40,000 deaths every year in the US alone. Preclinical studies strongly implicate activation of growth factor receptor, HER2 in endocrine treatment resistance of ER+ breast cancer that is HER2- at diagnosis1,2. However, clinical trials of pan-HER inhibitors in ER+/HER2- patients have disappointed, likely due to a lack of predictive biomarkers3-6. Here we demonstrate that loss of MLH1, a principal mismatch repair gene, causally activates HER2 in ER+/HER2- breast cancer upon endocrine treatment. Additionally, we show that HER2 activation is indispensable for endocrine treatment resistant growth of MLH1- cells in vitro and in vivo. Consequently, inhibiting HER2 restores sensitivity to endocrine treatment in multiple experimental models including patient-derived xenograft tumors. Patient data from multiple clinical datasets (TCGA, METABRIC, Alliance (Z1031) and E-GEOD-28826) supports an association between MLH1 loss, HER2 upregulation, and sensitivity to trastuzumab in endocrine treatment-resistant ER+/HER2- patients. These results provide strong rationale that MLH1 could serve as a first-in-class predictive marker of sensitivity to combinatorial treatment with endocrine drugs and HER inhibitors in endocrine treatment-resistant ER+/HER2- breast cancer patients. Implications of this study extend beyond breast cancer to Lynch Syndrome cancers.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryDefective mismatch repair activates HER2 in HER2-negative breast cancer cells and renders them susceptible to HER2 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Our knowledge of the diversity and evolution of the virosphere will likely increase dramatically with the study of microbial eukaryotes, including the microalgae in few RNA viruses have been documented to date. By combining meta-transcriptomic approaches with sequence and structural-based homology detection, followed by PCR confirmation, we identified 18 novel RNA viruses in two major groups of microbial algae - the chlorophytes and the chlorarachniophytes. Most of the RNA viruses identified in the green algae class Ulvophyceae were related to those from the families Tombusviridae and Amalgaviridae that have previously been associated with plants, suggesting that these viruses have an evolutionary history that extends to when their host groups shared a common ancestor. In contrast, seven ulvophyte associated viruses exhibited clear similarity with the mitoviruses that are most commonly found in fungi. This is compatible with horizontal virus transfer between algae and fungi, although mitoviruses have recently been documented in plants. We also document, for the first time, RNA viruses in the chlorarachniophytes, including the first observation of a negative-sense (bunya-like) RNA virus in microalgae. The other virus-like sequence detected in chlorarachniophytes is distantly related to those from the plant virus family Virgaviridae, suggesting that they may have been inherited from the secondary chloroplast endosymbiosis event that marked the origin of the chlorarachniophytes. More broadly, this work suggests that the scarcity of RNA viruses in algae most likely results from limited investigation rather than their absence. Greater effort is needed to characterize the RNA viromes of unicellular eukaryotes, including through structure-based methods that are able to detect distant homologies, and with the inclusion of a wider range of eukaryotic microorganisms.\n\nAuthor summaryRNA viruses are expected to infect all living organisms on Earth. Despite recent developments in and the deployment of large-scale sequencing technologies, our understanding of the RNA virosphere remains anthropocentric and largely restricted to human, livestock, cultivated plants and vectors for viral disease. However, a broader investigation of the diversity of RNA viruses, especially in protists, is expected to answer fundamental questions about their origin and long-term evolution. This study first investigates the RNA virus diversity in unicellular algae taxa from the phylogenetically distinct ulvophytes and chlorarachniophytes taxa. Despite very high levels of sequence divergence, we were able to identify 18 new RNA viruses, largely related to plant and fungi viruses, and likely illustrating a past history of horizontal transfer events that have occurred during RNA virus evolution. We also hypothesise that the sequence similarity between a chlorarachniophyte-associated virga-like virus and members of Virgaviridae associated with plants may represent inheritance from a secondary endosymbiosis event. A promising approach to detect the signals of distant virus homologies through the analysis of protein structures was also utilised, enabling us to identify potential highly divergent algal RNA viruses.",

    "abstract": "Cocktail combinations of bacteria-infecting viruses (bacteriophage), can suppress pathogenic bacterial growth. However, predicting how phage cocktails influence microbial communities with complex ecological interactions, specifically cross-feeding interactions in which bacteria exchange nutrients, remains challenging. Here, we used experiments and mathematical simulations to determine how to best suppress a model pathogen, E. coli, when obligately cross-feeding with S. enterica. We tested whether the duration of pathogen suppression caused by a two-lytic phage cocktail was maximized when both phage targeted E. coli, or when one phage targeted E. coli and the other its cross-feeding partner, S. enterica. Experimentally, we observed that cocktails targeting both cross-feeders suppressed E. coli growth longer than cocktails targeting only E. coli. Two non-mutually-exclusive mechanisms could explain these results: 1) we found that treatment with two E. coli phage led to the evolution of a mucoid phenotype that provided cross-resistance against both phage, and 2) S. enterica set the growth rate of the co-culture, and therefore targeting S. enterica had a stronger effect on pathogen suppression. Simulations suggested that cross-resistance and the relative growth rates of cross-feeders modulated the duration of E. coli suppression. More broadly, we describe a novel bacteriophage cocktail strategy for pathogens that cross-feed.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementCross-feeding, or exchanging nutrients among bacteria, is a type of ecological interaction found in many important microbial communities. Furthermore, cross-feeding interactions are found to play a role in some infections, and research into treating infections with combinations of bacteriophage in  cocktails is growing. Here, we used a combination of mathematical modelling and wet-lab experiments to optimize suppression of a model pathogen with a bacteriophage cocktail in a synthetic cross-feeding bacterial coculture. A key finding was that a physiological parameter - growth rate - of the bacteria was important to consider when choosing the most effective cocktail formulation. This work is novel because it highlights an unexpected multispecies-targeting strategy for designing phage cocktails for cross-feeding pathogens and has relevance to many ecological systems ranging from human health to agriculture. We demonstrate how leveraging knowledge of a pathogens ecological interaction has the potential to improve precision medicine and management of microbial systems.",

    "abstract": "After training on large datasets, certain deep neural networks are surprisingly good models of the neural mechanisms of adult primate visual object recognition. Nevertheless, these models are poor models of the development of the visual system because they posit millions of sequential, precisely coordinated synaptic updates, each based on a labeled image. While ongoing research is pursuing the use of unsupervised proxies for labels, we here explore a complementary strategy of reducing the required number of supervised synaptic updates to produce an adult-like ventral visual stream (as judged by the match to V1, V2, V4, IT, and behavior). Such models might require less precise machinery and energy expenditure to coordinate these updates and would thus move us closer to viable neuroscientific hypotheses about how the visual system wires itself up. Relative to the current leading model of the adult ventral stream, we here demonstrate that the total number of supervised weight updates can be substantially reduced using three complementary strategies: First, we find that only 2% of supervised updates (epochs and images) are needed to achieve ~80% of the match to adult ventral stream. Second, by improving the random distribution of synaptic connectivity, we find that 54% of the brain match can already be achieved \"at birth\" (i.e. no training at all). Third, we find that, by training only ~5% of model synapses, we can still achieve nearly 80% of the match to the ventral stream. When these three strategies are applied in combination, we find that these new models achieve ~80% of a fully trained models match to the brain, while using two orders of magnitude fewer supervised synaptic updates. These results reflect first steps in modeling not just primate adult visual processing during inference, but also how the ventral visual stream might be \"wired up\" by evolution (a models \"birth\" state) and by developmental learning (a models updates based on visual experience).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundImbalance in prefrontal cortical (PFC) pyramidal neuron excitation:inhibition is thought to underlie symptomologies shared across stress-related disorders and neuropsychiatric disease, including dysregulation of emotion and cognitive function. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying K+ (GIRK/Kir3) channels mediate excitability of medial PFC pyramidal neurons, however the functional role of these channels in mPFC-dependent regulation of affect, cognition, and cortical dynamics is unknown.\n\nMethodsIn mice harboring a  floxed version of the kcnj3 (Girk1) gene, we used a viral-cre approach to disrupt GIRK1-containing channel expression in pyramidal neurons within the prelimbic (PL) or infralimbic (IL) cortices. Additional studies used a novel model of chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) to determine the impact on PL GIRK-dependent signaling and cognitive function.\n\nResultsIn males, loss of pyramidal GIRK-dependent signaling in the PL, but not IL, differentially impacted measures of affect and motivation, and impaired working memory and cognitive flexibility. CUS produced similar deficits in affect and cognition that paralleled a reduction in PL pyramidal GIRK-dependent signaling akin to viral approaches. Viral- and stress-induced behavioral deficits were rescued by systemic injection of a novel, GIRK1-selective agonist, ML-297. Unexpectedly, neither ablation of PL GIRK-dependent signaling or exposure to the CUS regimen impacted affect or cognition in female mice.\n\nConclusionsGIRK-dependent signaling in male mice, but not females, is critical for maintaining optimal PL function and behavioral control. Disruption of this inhibition may underlie stress-related dysfunction of the PL and represent a therapeutic target for treating stress-induced deficits in affect regulation and impaired cognition that reduce quality of life.",

    "abstract": "Food-induced morphological plasticity, a type of developmental plasticity, is a well-documented phenomenon in larvae of the echinoid echinoderm, Dendraster excentricus. A recent study in our lab has shown that this morphological plasticity is associated with significant physiological plasticity for growth. The goal of the current study was to measure several aspects of protein metabolism in larvae growing at different rates to understand the mechanistic basis for this physiological growth plasticity. Larvae of D. excentricus were fed rations of 1,000 (low-fed) or 10,000 (high-fed) algal cells mL\u22121. Primary measurements of protein growth, algal ingestion, aerobic metabolism, alanine transport and protein synthesis were used to model growth and protein metabolism. Relative protein growth rates were 6.0 and 12.2 % day\u22121 for low- and high-fed larvae, respectively. The energetic cost of protein synthesis was similar between both treatments at 4.91 J (mg protein synthesized)\u22121. Larvae in both treatments used about 50% of their metabolic energy production to fuel protein synthesis. Mass-specific rates of protein synthesis were also similar. The most important difference between low- and high-fed larvae were mass-specific rates of protein degradation. Low-fed larvae had relatively low rates of degradation early in development that increased with larval age, surpassing high-fed degradation rates at 20 days post-fertilization. Changes in protein depositional efficiency during development were similar to those of larval growth efficiency, indicating that differences in protein metabolism are largely responsible for whole-organism growth plasticity. Mass-specific alanine transport rates were about 2-times higher in low-fed larvae, demonstrating that the longer arms of low-fed larvae may be a mechanism for acquiring more dissolved nutrients from their environment. In total, these results provide an explanation for the differences in growth efficiency between low- and high-fed larvae and demonstrate the importance of protein degradation pathways in establishing these growth differences. These observations, together with previous studies measuring morphological and physiological plastic responses, allow for a more integrated understanding of developmental plasticity in echinoid larvae.AbbreviationsDPFdays post-fertilizationPOpostoral armAEassimilation efficiencyGGEgross growth efficiencyNGEnet growth efficiencyPGEprotein growth efficiencyPDEprotein depositional efficiencyMBLmidline body lengthFAAfree amino acid poolRGRrelative growth rateBCAbicinchoninic assayBSAbovine serum albuminTCAtrichloroacetic acidBODbiological oxygen demandTORtarget of rapamycinDOMdissolved organic materialView Full Text",

Amphidiploid plants derived from hybridization of  Roshan x Aegilops cylindrica and  Chinese Spring x Ae. cylindrica genotypes contrasting in salt tolerance were assessed for their morpho-physiological responses and the expression patterns of three genes related to ion homeostasis under 250 mM NaCl. Results showed that salt stress caused significant declines in both their morphological and phenological traits. Moreover, salt stress reduced not only their chlorophyll content but also their root and shoot K contents and K/Na ratios, while it led to significant enhancements in the remaining traits. Similar to Ae. cylindrica, the amphidiploids subjected to salt stress exhibited significantly higher H2O2 levels, root and shoot K contents, and root and shoot K/Na ratios accompanied by lower root and shoot Na contents and MDA concentrations when compared with the same traits in the wheat parents. Quantitative Real-Time PCR showed significant differential expression patterns of the HKT1;5, NHX1, and SOS1 genes between the amphidiploids and their parents. The transcript level of HKT1;5 was found to be higher in the roots than in the shoots of both the amphidiploids and Ae. cylindrica while NHX1 exhibited a higher expression in the shoot tissues. The consistency of these data provides compelling support for the hypothesis that active exclusion of Na from the roots and elevated vacuolar sequestration of Na in the leaves might explain the declining Na levels in the shoots and roots of both the amphidiploids and Ae. cylindrica relative to those measured in wheat parents. It is concluded that the hybridized amphiploids are potentially valuable resources for salt improvement in bread wheat through the backcrossing approach.",

    "abstract": "Advanced age is strongly correlated with both increased cancer incidence and general immune decline. The immune tumor microenvironment (ITME) has been established as an important prognostic of both therapeutic efficacy and overall patient survival. Thus, age-related immune decline is an important consideration for the treatment of a large subset of cancer patients. Current studies of aging-related immune alterations are predominantly performed on non-cancerous tissue, requiring additional study into the effects of age on tumor immune infiltration. We leverage large scale transcriptional data sets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Genotype-Tissue Expression project to distinguish normal age-related immune alterations from age-related changes in tumor immune infiltration. We demonstrate that while there is overlap between the normal immune aging phenotype and that of the ITME, there are several changes in immune cell abundance that are specific to the ITME, particularly in T cell, NK cell, and Macrophage populations. These results suggest that aged immune cells are more susceptible to tumor suppression of cytotoxic immune cell infiltration and activity than normal tissues, which creates an unfavorable ITME in older patients in excess of normal immune decline with age and may inform the application of existing and emerging immunotherapies for this large population of patients. We additionally identify that age-related increases in tumor mutational burden are associated with decreased DNA methylation and increased expression of the immune checkpoint genes PDL1, CD80, and LAG3 which may have implications for therapeutic application of immune checkpoint blockade in older patients.",

    "abstract": "Predation is one of the driving forces that shaped the marine ecosystems through time. Apart from the anti-predatory strategies adopted by the prey, the predatory outcome is often indirectly influenced by the other members of the ecological community. Association between organisms are often found to influence the outcome and the evolution of such association may have been guided by such interactions. Mollusc-burnacle association, although common, is not explored to assess if the epibiont offers the molluscs any protection against predation (associational resistance) or increases the risk by attracting predators (shared doom). Using a series of controlled experiments with a drilling predator (Paratectonatica tigrina), its prey (Pirenella cingulata) and an epibiont (Amphibalanus amphitrite), we evaluated the effect of epibionts on the drilling behavior of the predator by documenting the successful attack (Drilling frequency, DF), and handling time. Our results show that the prey with epibionts are significantly less likely to be drilled when the predator has sufficient choice of prey, consistent with the tenets of the associational resistance. The preference of choosing the non-encrusted prey, however, diminishes with fewer available prey. The handling time is significantly higher in the attacks on the encrusted prey than non-encrusted prey, even though the barnacles are not drilled. Although the proximity of the drilling site to encrustation tends to increase the handling time, the size of encrustation does not have any effect. Because the profitability of prey largely depends on the ratio of handling time and the energetic yield from consuming the prey, the increase in handling time due to encrustation makes it less profitable for the predator. The role of encrustation as a deterrent to predation might also explain the complex shell architecture in some prey gastropods that increases the likelihood of encrustation besides providing direct resistance against predation.",

    "abstract": "Efficient co-transcriptional splicing is thought to suppress the formation of genome-destabilizing R-loops upon interaction between nascent RNA and the DNA template. Inhibition of the SF3B splicing complex using Pladienolide B (PladB) in human K562 cells caused widespread intron retention and nearly 2,000 instances of R-loops gains. However, only minimal overlap existed between these events, arguing that unspliced introns do not cause excessive R-loops. R-loop gains were instead driven by readthrough transcription resulting from loss of transcription termination over a subset of stress-response genes, defining a new class of aberrant \"downstream of genes\" (DoG) R-loops. Such DoG R-loops were temporally and spatially uncoupled from loci experiencing DNA damage. Unexpectedly, the predominant response to splicing inhibition was a global R-loop loss resulting from accumulation of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerases and defective elongation. Thus, SF3B1-targeted splicing inhibition triggered profound alterations in transcriptional dynamics, leading to unexpected disruptions in the global R-loop landscape.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIIntron retention caused by SF3B1 inhibition does not lead to excessive R-loops\nC_LIO_LIA subset of genes shows readthrough transcription and accompanying R-loop gains\nC_LIO_LISF3B1 inhibition causes broad reduction in nascent transcription and R-loop loss\nC_LIO_LIR-loop gains and DNA damage are temporally and spatially uncoupled\nC_LI",
