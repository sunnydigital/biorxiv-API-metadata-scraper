    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the cause of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, like many other viruses, uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) to enable synthesis of multiple proteins from its compact genome. In independent analyses, we evaluated the PRF regions of all SARS-CoV-2 sequences available in GenBank and from the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data for variations. Of the 5,156 and 27,153 sequences analyzed, respectively, the PRF regions were identical in 95.7% and 97.2% of isolates. The most common change from the reference sequence was from C to U at position 13,536, which lies in the three-stemmed pseudoknot known to stimulate frameshifting. With the conversion of the G13493-C13536 Watson-Crick pair to G-U, the SARS-CoV-2 PRF closely resembles its counterpart in the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. The occurrence of this change increased from 0.5 to 3% during the period of March to May 2020.",

    "abstract": "A critical event during the process of cell infection by a viral particle is attachment, which is driven by adhesive interactions and resisted by bending and tension. The biophysics of this process has been studied extensively but the additional role of externally applied force or displacement has generally been neglected. In this work we study the adhesive force-displacement response of viral particles against a cell membrane. We have built two models: one in which the viral particle is cylindrical (say, representative of filamentous virus such as Ebola) and another in which it is spherical (such as SARS-CoV-2 and Zika). Our interest is in initial adhesion, in which case deformations are small and the mathematical model for the system can be simplified considerably. The parameters that characterize the process combine into two dimensionless groups that represent normalized membrane bending stiffness and tension. In the limit where bending dominates, for sufficiently large values of normalized bending stiffness, there is no adhesion between viral particles and the cell membrane without applied force. (The zero-external-force contact width and pull-off force are both zero.) For large values of normalized membrane tension, the adhesion between virus and cell membrane is weak but stable. (The contact width at zero external force has a small value.) Our results for pull-off force and zero force contact width help to quantify conditions that could aid the development of therapies based on denying the virus entry into the cell by blocking its initial adhesion.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The natural resistance of rapid growth Mycobacterium (RGM) against multiple antibiotics renders the treatment of caused infections less successful and time consuming. Therefore, new effective agents are urgently needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of 115 isolates, constituting different RGM species, against four oxazolidinones i.e. delpazolid, sutezolid, tedizolid and linezolid. Additionally, 32 reference strains of different RGM species were also tested. The four oxazolidinones exhibited potent in vitro activity against the recruited RGM reference strains, 24 out of 32 RGM species had MICs [&le;] 8 g/mL against all four oxazolidinones whereas tedizolid and delpazolid generally presented lower MICs than linezolid or sutezolid. Tedizolid showed the strongest activity against clinical isolates of M. abscessus with MIC50=1g/mL and MIC90=2g/mL. MIC values for tedizolid were usually 4- to 8-fold less than the MICs of linezolid for M. abscessus subsp. abscessus. The MIC distributions of sutezolid and linezolid were similar, while delpazolid showed 2-fold lower MIC as compared with linezolid. Linezolid was not active against most of the tested M. fortuitum isolates, 22 out of the 25 M. fortuitum were resistant against linezolid. However, delpazolid exhibited better antimicrobial activity against these isolates with 4-fold lower MIC values, in contrast with linezolid. In addition, the protein alignment of RplC and RplD and structure based analysis showed that there may be no correlation between oxazolidinones resistance and mutations in rplC, rplD and 23 srRNAgenes in tested RGM. This study showed tedizolid harbors the strongest inhibitory activity against M. abscessus in vitro, while delpazolid presented the best activity against M. fortuitum, which provided important insights on the potential clinical application of oxazolidinones to treat RGM infections.",

    "abstract": "We previously showed that oral administration of cystine and theanine (CT) to mice confers resistance to influenza virus infection. In human studies, CT prevented colds in healthy subjects and enhanced antibody production after influenza vaccination in elderly individuals with a poor nutritional status. The mechanism of action of CT is thought to be glutathione (GSH)-mediated regulation of intracellular redox, which might affect innate immune systems such as macrophages to exert physiological effects. The effect of CT on influenza is independent of viral type, and this treatment has a broad range of antiviral activities. To explore the mechanisms of CT in viral infection, we performed transcriptome profiling of spleen tissues isolated from influenza A virus (IAV)-infected mice. We identified unique gene signatures in response to CT in the IAV-infected mice. Genes upregulated by CT included redox-regulated genes such as GCLC/GCLM (subunits of glutamate cysteine ligase, a rate-limiting enzyme of GSH biosynthesis), TXN1, TXN2, TXNRD2, and SOD1, suggesting that the intracellular redox environment is substantially altered by CT. However, genes downregulated in response to CT included chemokine/chemokine receptor genes (CCL5, CCL19, CXCL9, CXCL12, CXCR3, CXCR4, and ACKR3), some of which are related to cytokine storm. A comparison with public COVID-19-related gene set data showed that the upregulated gene signature was highly similar to the downregulated gene sets of SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and the upregulated gene set of attenuated SARS-CoV-infected cells. In conclusion, the unique gene signatures observed in response to orally administered CT in IAV-infected mouse spleen tissues suggested that CT may attenuate viral infection, replication and associated symptoms such as cytokine storm.",

    "abstract": "Coastal winds transport water masses and larval fish onshore or offshore which may influence estuarine recruitment, yet our understanding of the mechanism underlying this relationship is limited. Here, we combine datasets from a historical database of larval fish off southeast Australia with a high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis model to show that normalised abundance of coastally spawned larvae increased with weak to moderate upwelling favourable winds 14 days prior to sampling. The increase in abundance may reflect increased nutrient and plankton availability for larval fish. Normalised larval abundance decreased following strong upwelling favourable winds but increased after onshore (downwelling favourable) winds, due to wind-driven transport. By combining a commercial estuarine fisheries catch-rate dataset (4 species, 8 estuaries, 10 years) and the high-resolution atmospheric reanalysis model, we show that negative effects of upwelling favourable winds during the spawning period can be detected in lagged estuarine commercial fisheries catch rates (lagged by 2 - 8 years depending on species growth rates), potentially representing the same mechanism proposed for larval fish. Upwelling favourable winds in the southeast Australian region have increased since 1850 while onshore winds have decreased, which may reduce larval recruitment to estuaries. Coastal winds are likely an important factor for estuarine recruitment in the southeast Australian region and future research on the estuarine recruitment of fish should incorporate coastal winds.",

    "abstract": "Clinical use of antimicrobials faces great challenges from the emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogens. The overexpression of drug efflux pumps is one of the major contributors to MDR. It is considered as a promising approach to overcome MDR by reversing the function of drug efflux pumps. In the life-threatening fungal pathogen Candida albicans, the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter Mdr1p can excrete many structurally unrelated antifungals, leading to multidrug resistance. Here we report a counterintuitive case of reversing multidrug resistance in C. albicans by using a natural product berberine to hijack the overexpressed Mdr1p for its own importation. Moreover, we illustrate that the imported berberine accumulates in mitochondria, and compromises the mitochondrial function by impairing mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial Complex I. It results in the selective elimination of Mdr1p overexpressed C. albicans cells. Furthermore, we show that berberine treatment can prolong the mean survival time (MST) of mice with a blood-borne dissemination of Mdr1p overexpressed multidrug resistant candidiasis. This study provided a potential direction of novel anti-MDR drug discovery by screening for multidrug efflux pump converters.",

    "abstract": "The vaginal microbiome plays an important role in human health and species of vaginal bacteria have been associated with reproductive disease. Strain level variation is also thought to be important, but the diversity, structure and evolutionary history of vaginal strains is not as well characterized. We developed and validated an approach to measure strain variation from metagenomic data based on SNPs within the core-genomes for six species of vaginal bacteria: G. vaginalis, L. crispatus, L. iners, L. jensenii, L. gasseri, and A. vaginae. Despite inhabiting the same environment, strain diversity and structure varies across species. All species except L. iners are characterized by multiple distinct groups of strains. Even so, strain diversity is lower in the Lactobacillus species, consistent with a more recent colonization of the human vaginal microbiome. Both strain diversity and the frequency of multi-strain samples is related to species-level diversity of the microbiome in which they occur, suggesting similar ecological factors influencing diversity within the vaginal niche. We conclude that the structure of strain level variation provides both the motivation and means of testing whether strain level differences contribute to the function and health consequences of the vaginal microbiome.\n\nData SummaryAll vaginal metagenomic sequence data generated for this project can be found on the Sequence Read Archive under BioProject PRJNA639592.",

    "abstract": "Viruses have developed innovative strategies to exploit the cellular machinery and overcome the host antiviral defenses, often using specifically structured RNA elements. Examples are found in flaviviruses; during flaviviral infection, pathogenic subgenomic flaviviral RNAs (sfRNAs) accumulate in the cell. These sfRNAs are formed when a host cell 5 to 3 exoribonuclease degrades the viral genomic RNA but is blocked by an exoribonuclease resistant RNA structure (xrRNA) located in the viral genomes 3untranslated region (UTR). Although known to exist in several Flaviviridae genera the full distribution and diversity of xRNAs in this virus family was unknown. Using the recent high-resolution structure of an xrRNA from the divergent flavivirus Tamana bat virus (TABV) as a reference, we used bioinformatic searches to identify xrRNA in the Pegivirus, Pestivirus, and Hepacivirus genera. We biochemically and structurally characterized several examples, determining that they are genuine xrRNAs with a conserved fold. These new xrRNAs look superficially similar to the previously described xrRNAs but possess structural differences making them distinct from previous classes of xrRNAs. Our findings thus require adjustments of previous xrRNA classification schemes and expand on the previously known distribution of the xrRNA in Flaviviridae, indicating their widespread distribution and illustrating their importance.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe Flaviviridae comprise one of the largest families of positive sense single stranded (+ssRNA) and it is divided into the Flavivirus, Pestivirus, Pegivirus, and Hepacivirus genera. The genus Flavivirus contains many medically relevant viruses such as Zika Virus, Dengue Virus, and Powassan Virus. In these, a part of the viruss RNA twists up into a very special three-dimensional shape called an xrRNA that blocks the ability of the cell to \"chew up\" the viral RNA. Hence, part of the virus RNA remains intact, and this protected part is important for viral infection. This was known to occur in Flaviviruses but whether it existed in the other members of the family was not known. In this study, we not only identified a new subclass of xrRNA found in Flavivirus but also in the remaining three genera. The fact that this process of viral RNA maturation exists throughout the entire Flaviviridae family makes it clear that this is an important but underappreciated part of the infection strategy of these diverse human pathogens.",

Bacterial pathogens causing the UTIs were identified using the colony morphology, Grams staining and biochemical characterization techniques. Microbial inhibitory test of antibiotics and leaf extracts were performed using the disc diffusion and well diffusion techniques respectively. MIC and MLC were determined by broth dilution method. Binary probit model was used to determine the prevalence of UTI across people of different age group and gender. Four bacterial strains namely Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were identified as the causative agents of UTI among the people. The E. coli was identified as most infectious while S. aureus as the least infectious pathogen. Females in the age group of  16-30 years and male within  61-75 years were more susceptible to UTI. Among the tested leaf extracts, Tamarindus indica and Clitoria ternatea were more effective to treat UTI as compared to the tested antibiotics Ceftriaxone and Piperacillin.

    "abstract": "Oral supplementation of the NAD+ precursor Nicotinamide Riboside (NR) has been reported to increase Sirtuin (SIRT) signalling, mitochondrial biogenesis and endurance capacity in rodent skeletal muscle. However, whether NR supplementation can elicit a similar response in human skeletal muscle is unclear. This study aimed to assess the effect of 7-day NR supplementation on exercise-induced transduction and transcriptional responses in skeletal muscle of young, healthy, recreationally active human volunteers. In a double-blinded, randomised, counter-balanced, crossover design, eight male participants (age: 23 \u00b1 4 years, VO2peak: 46.5 \u00b1 4.4 mL\u00b7kg-1\u00b7min-1) received one week of NR or cellulose placebo (PLA) supplementation (1000 mg\u00b7d-1) before performing one hour of cycling at 60% Wmax. Muscle biopsies were collected prior to supplementation and pre-, immediately and three-hours post-exercise from the medial vastus lateralis, whilst venous blood samples were collected throughout the trial. Global acetylation, auto-PARylation of PARP1, acetylation of p53Lys382 and MnSODLys122 were unaffected by NR supplementation or exercise. Exercise led to an increase in AMPKThr172 (1.6-fold), and ACCSer79 (4-fold) phosphorylation, in addition to an increase in PGC-1\u03b1 (\u223c5-fold) and PDK4 (\u223c10-fold) mRNA expression, however NR had no additional effect on this response. There was also no effect of NR supplementation on substrate utilisation at rest or during exercise or on skeletal muscle mitochondrial respiration. Finally, NR supplementation blunted the exercise induced activation of skeletal muscle NNMT mRNA expression, but had no effect on mRNA expression of NMRK1, NAMPT or NMNAT1, which were not significantly affected by NR supplementation or exercise. In summary, one week of NR supplementation does not augment skeletal muscle signal transduction pathways implicated in mitochondrial adaptation to endurance exercise.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Lack of effective treatments for aggressive breast cancer is still a major global health problem. We previously reported that Photodynamic Therapy using Methylene Blue as photosensitizer (MB-PDT) massively kills metastatic human breast cancer, marginally affecting healthy cells. In this study we aimed to unveil the molecular mechanisms behind MB-PDT effectiveness. Through lipidomic and biochemical approaches we demonstrated that MB-PDT efficiency and specificity relies on polyunsaturated fatty acids-enriched membranes and on the better capacity to deal with photooxidative damage displayed by non-tumorigenic cells. We found out that, in tumorigenic cells, lysosome membrane permeabilization is accompanied by ferroptosis and/or necroptosis. Our results broadened the understanding of MB-PDT-induced photooxidation mechanisms and specificity in breast cancer cells. Therefore, we demonstrated that efficient approaches could be designed on the basis of lipid composition and metabolic features for hard-to-treat cancers. The results further reinforce MB-PDT as a therapeutic strategy for highly aggressive human breast cancer cells.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Deep waters represent the largest biome on Earth and the largest ecosystem of Costa Rica. Fungi play a fundamental role in global biogeochemical cycling in marine sediments, yet, they remain little explored. We studied fungal diversity and community composition in several marine sediments from 16 locations sampled along a bathymetric gradient (from a depth of 380 to 3474 m) in two transects of about 1500 km length in the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) of Costa Rica. Sequence analysis of the V7-V8 region of the 18S rRNA gene obtained from sediment cores revealed the presence of 787 fungal amplicon sequence variants (ASVs). On average, we detected a richness of 75 fungal ASVs per sample. Ascomycota represented the most abundant phylum with Saccharomycetes constituting the dominant class. Three ASVs accounted for ca. 63% of all fungal sequences: the yeast Metschnikowia (49.4%), Rhizophydium (6.9%), and Cladosporium (6.7%). Although we distinguished a cluster dominated by yeasts and a second cluster dominated by filamentous fungi, we were unable to detect a strong effect of depth, temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH on the composition of fungal communities. We highlight the need to understand further the ecological role of fungi in deep-sea ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "SummarySystems based on the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and CRISPR associated proteins (Cas) have revolutionized genome editing in many organisms, including plants. Most CRISPR-Cas strategies in plants rely on genetic transformation using Agrobacterium tumefaciens to supply the gene editing reagents, such as the Cas nucleases or the guide RNA (gRNA). While the Cas nucleases are constant elements in editing approaches, gRNAs are target-specific and a screening process is usually required to identify those most effective. Plant virus-derived vectors are an alternative for the fast and efficient delivery of gRNAs into adult plants, due to the virus capacity for genome amplification and systemic movement, a strategy known as virus-induced genome editing (VIGE). In this work, we engineered Potato virus X (PVX) to build a vector able to easily express one or more gRNAs in adult solanaceous plants. Using the PVX-based vector, Nicotiana benthamiana genes were efficiently targeted, producing nearly 80% indels in a transformed line that constitutively expressed Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9. Interestingly, results showed that the PVX vector allows expression of arrays of unspaced gRNAs achieving highly efficient multiplex editing in a few days in adult plant tissues. We also demonstrate that genome modifications are inherited in plants regenerated from infected tissues. In sum, the new PVX VIGE vector allows easy, fast and efficient expression of gRNAs arrays for multiplex CRISPR-Cas genome editing and will be a useful tool for functional gene analysis and precision breeding across diverse plant species, particularly in important crops of the family Solanaceae.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Species of the genus Danio display strikingly different colour patterns ranging from horizontal stripes, to vertical bars or spots7-10. Stripe formation in zebrafish, Danio rerio, oriented by the horizontal myoseptum, is a self-organizing process based on cell-contact-mediated interactions between three types of chromatophores with a leading role of iridophores11-14. We investigated genes known to regulate chromatophore interactions in zebrafish as candidates that might have evolved to produce a pattern of vertical bars in its sibling species, Danio aesculapii8,10. Using gene editing15-17 we generated several mutants in D. aesculapii that demonstrate a lower complexity in the interactions between chromatophores in this species, as well as a minor role of iridophores in patterning. Complementation tests in interspecific hybrids18,19 identified obelix/Kcnj13, which encodes an inwardly rectifying potassium channel (Kir7.1)20, as a gene evolved between D. rerio and D. aesculapii as well as in two of seven more Danio species tested.

    "abstract": "As hosts acquire resistance to viruses, viruses must overcome that resistance to re-establish infectivity, or go extinct. Despite the significant hurdles associated with adapting to a resistant host, viruses are evolutionarily successful and maintain stable coevolutionary relationships with their hosts. To investigate the factors underlying how pathogens adapt to their hosts, we performed a deep mutational scan of the region of the \u03bb tail fiber tip protein that mediates contact with the \u03bb host, E. coli. Phages harboring amino acid substitutions were subjected to selection for infectivity on wild type E. coli, revealing a highly restrictive fitness landscape, in which most substitutions completely abrogate function. By comparing this lack of mutational tolerance to evolutionary diversity, we highlight a set of mutationally intolerant and diverse positions associated with host range expansion. Imposing selection for infectivity on three \u03bb-resistant hosts, each harboring a different missense mutation in the \u03bb receptor, reveals hundreds of adaptive variants in \u03bb. We distinguish \u03bb variants that confer promiscuity, a general ability to overcome host resistance, from those that drive host-specific infectivity. Both processes may be important in driving adaptation to a novel host.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The apical complex is the instrument of invasion used by apicomplexan parasites, and the conoid is a conspicuous feature of this apparatus found throughout this phylum. The conoid, however, is believed to be heavily reduced or missing from Plasmodium species and other members of the class Aconoidasida. Relatively few conoid proteins have previously been identified, making it difficult to address how conserved this feature is throughout the phylum, and whether it is genuinely missing from some major groups. Moreover, parasites such as Plasmodium species cycle through three invasive forms and there is the possibility of differential presence of the conoid between these stages. We have applied spatial proteomics and high-resolution microscopy to develop a more complete molecular inventory and understanding of the organisation of conoid-associated proteins in the model apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. These data revealed molecular conservation of all conoid substructures throughout Apicomplexa, including Plasmodium, and even in allied Myzozoa such as Chromera and dinoflagellates. We reporter-tagged and observed the expression and location of several conoid complex proteins in the malaria model P. berghei and revealed equivalent structures in all of its zoite forms, as well as evidence of molecular differentiation between blood-stage merozoites and the ookinetes and sporozoites of the mosquito vector. Collectively we show that the conoid is a conserved apicomplexan element at the heart of the invasion mechanisms of these highly successful and often devastating parasites.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid male sterility (HMS) contributes to reproductive isolation commonly observed among house mouse (Mus musculus) subspecies, both in the wild and in laboratory crosses. Incompatibilities involving specific Prdm9 alleles and certain Chromosome (Chr) X genotypes are known determinants of fertility and HMS, and previous work in the field has demonstrated that genetic background modifies these two major loci. We constructed hybrids that have identical genotypes at Prdm9 and identical X chromosomes, but differ widely across the rest of the genome. In each case, we crossed female PWK/PhJ mice representative of the M. m. musculus subspecies to males from a classical inbred strain representative of M. m. domesticus: 129S1/SvImJ, A/J, C57BL/6J, or DBA/2J. We detected three distinct trajectories of fertility among the hybrids using breeding experiments. The PWK129S1 males were always infertile. PWKDBA2 males were fertile, despite their genotypes at the major HMS loci. We also observed age-dependent changes in fertility parameters across multiple genetic backgrounds. The PWKB6 and PWKAJ males were always infertile before 15 weeks and after 35 weeks, yet some PWKB6 and PWKAJ males were fertile between fifteen and 35 weeks. This observation could resolve previous contradictory reports about the fertility of PWKB6. Taken together, these results point to multiple segregating HMS modifier alleles, some of which have age-related modes of action. The ultimate identification of these alleles and their age-related mechanisms will advance understanding both of the genetic architecture of HMS and of how reproductive barriers are maintained between house mouse subspecies.",

    "abstract": "Extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) are major causes of urinary and bloodstream infections. ExPEC reservoirs are not completely understood. Some mastitis-associated E. coli (MAEC) strains carry genes associated with ExPEC virulence, including metal scavenging, immune avoidance, and host attachment functions. In this study, we investigated the role of the high-affinity zinc uptake (znuABC) system in the MAEC strain M12. Elimination of znuABC moderately decreased fitness during mouse mammary gland infections. The {Delta}znuABC mutant strain exhibited an unexpected growth delay in the presence of bile salts, which was alleviated by the addition of excess zinc. We isolated {Delta}znuABC mutant suppressor mutants with improved growth of in bile salts, several of which no longer produced the K96 capsule made by strain M12. Addition of bile salts also reduced capsule production by strain M12 and ExPEC strain CP9, suggesting that capsule synthesis may be detrimental when bile salts are present. To better understand the role of the capsule, we compared the virulence of mastitis strain M12 with its unencapsulated {Delta}kpsCS mutant in two models of ExPEC disease. The wild type strain successfully colonized mouse bladders and kidneys and was highly virulent in intraperitoneal infections. Conversely, the {Delta}kpsCS mutant was unable to colonize kidneys and was unable to cause sepsis. These results demonstrate that some MAEC may be capable of causing human ExPEC illness. Virulence of strain M12 in these infections is dependent on its capsule. However, capsule may interfere with zinc homeostasis in the presence of bile salts while in the digestive tract.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo present and assess a method for choosing a fixed increment between spokes in radially sampled MRI that results in higher SNR than other radial sampling increments.\n\nTheory and MethodsSampling uniformity contributes to image SNR when reconstructed using linear methods. Thus, for a radial trajectory, uniformly spaced sampling is ideal. However, uniform sampling lacks post-acquisition reconstruction flexibility, which is often needed in dynamic imaging. Golden ratio-based increments are often used for this purpose. The method presented here, Set Increment with Limited Views Encoding Ratio (SILVER), optimizes sampling uniformity when a limited number of temporal resolutions are required. With SILVER, an optimization algorithm finds the angular increment that provides the highest uniformity for a pre-defined set of reconstruction window sizes. SILVER was tested over multiple sets and assessed in terms of uniformity, noise amplification, and SNR both in simulations and in acquisitions of a phantom and healthy volunteers.\n\nResultsThe proposed algorithm produced trajectories that, for the optimized window sizes, had higher uniformity and lower image noise than golden ratio sampling both in a simulated single-coil system and in a multi-coil system, assessed using simulation, phantom, and in vivo experiments. The noise in SILVER optimized trajectories was comparable to uniformly distributed spokes whilst retaining flexibility in reconstruction at multiple temporal resolutions. In a resting state fMRI experiment, tSNR increases at different spatial and temporal resolutions ranged from 21-72%.\n\nConclusionSILVER is a simple addition to any sequence currently using golden ratio sampling and significantly increases sampling efficiency and SNR.",

    "abstract": "\"Open science\" is an umbrella term describing various aspects of transparent and open science principles. The adoption of open science principles at different levels of the scientific process (e.g., individual researchers, laboratories, institutions) has been rapidly changing the scientific research landscape in the past years, but uptake of these principles differ from discipline to discipline. Here, we asked to what extent journals in the field of sleep and chronobiology research encourage or even require following transparent and open science principles in their author guidelines. To this end, we scored the author guidelines of a comprehensive set of 28 sleep and chronobiology journals, including the major outlets in the field, using the standardised Transparency and Openness (TOP) Factor. This instrument rates the extent to which journals encourage or require following various aspects of open science, including data citation, data transparency, analysis code transparency, materials transparency, design and analysis guidelines, study pre-registration, analysis plan pre-registration, replication, registered reports, and the use of open science badges. Across the 28 journals, we find low values on the TOP Factor (median [25th, 75th percentile] 2.5 [1, 3], min. 0, max. 9, out of a total possible score of 28). This suggests an opportunity for sleep and chronobiology journals to further support the recent developments by implementing transparency and openness principles in their guidelines and making adherence to them mandatory.",

    "abstract": "Continuing advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) demonstrate the promise it holds for revealing biological structures at chemical resolution, in which noncovalent interactions, RNA and protein modifications, and solvation can be modeled accurately. At present, the best cryo-EM-derived models of the bacterial ribosome are of the large (50S) ribosomal subunit with effective global resolutions of 2.4-2.5 [A], based on map-to-model Fourier shell correlation (FSC). Here we present a model of the E. coli 70S ribosome with an effective global resolution of 2.0 [A], based on maps showcasing unambiguous positioning of residues, their detailed chemical interactions, and chemical modifications. These modifications include the first examples of isopeptide and thioamide backbone substitutions in ribosomal proteins, the former of which is likely conserved in all domains of life. The model also defines extensive solvation of the small (30S) ribosomal subunit for the first time, as well as interactions with A-site and P-site tRNAs, mRNA, and the antibiotic paromomycin. The high quality of the maps now allows a deeper phylogenetic analysis of ribosomal components, and identification of structural conservation to the level of solvation. The maps and models of the bacterial ribosome presented here should enable future structural analysis of the chemical basis for translation, and the development of robust tools for cryo-EM structure modeling and refinement.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible for a high number of acute and chronic hospital-acquired infections. As it develops more and more resistances against existing antibiotics, P. aeruginosa has been placed highest on the global priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria for which alternative treatments are urgently needed. Former studies have highlighted the crucial role of the bacterial lectin LecA and the host cell glycosphingolipid globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) for the cellular uptake of P. aeruginosa into epithelial cells via the lipid zipper mechanism. To further characterize the host cell plasma membrane domain for LecA-driven attachment and invasion, we analyzed the protein and lipid composition of pulled-down membrane domains for novel interaction partners of LecA by mass spectrometry. We unraveled a predilection of LecA for binding to saturated Gb3 species in the extracellular membrane leaflet and an induction of dynamic phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate clusters at the intracellular leaflet co-localizing with sites of LecA binding. Moreover, we identified the GPI-anchored protein CD59 and flotillins, known as cargo and eponymous component of flotillin-assisted endocytosis, as LecA interaction partners. Depletion of each of these host cell proteins resulted in more than 50% of reduction in invasiveness of the P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 highlighting the importance of this LecA-induced plasma membrane domain. Our strategy to reduce the complexity of host-pathogen interactions by first identifying interaction partners of a single virulence factor and subsequently transferring these findings to the bacterium has been proven to be a successful approach in elucidating the molecular mechanisms of bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "The canonical function of the Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex is the tethering of transport carriers. GARP belongs to the complexes associated with tethering containing helical rods (CATCHR) family and is a hetero-tetrameric complex consisting of the subunits Vps51, Vps52, Vps53 and Vps54. How the activity of GARP is regulated and if it possesses other functions besides tethering remains largely unknown. Here we identify the GARP subunit Vps53 as a novel regulatory target of the S. cerevisiae AMP kinase (AMPK) homolog Snf1. We find that Vps53 is both an in vivo and in vitro target of Snf1 and show that phosphorylation depends on the nature and quantity of the available carbon source. Phosphorylation of Vps53 does not affect the canonical trafficking pathway, but results in altered mitochondrial dynamics and the formation of a previously unknown contact site between the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria, termed GoMiCS. Our results provide an example of a subunit of a CATCHR complex with a constitutive function in membrane trafficking and an inducible role in organelle contact site formation. We anticipate our results to be the starting point for the characterization of this novel contact site.",

    "abstract": "After injury, severed dendrites and axons expose the \"eat-me\" signal phosphatidylserine (PS) on their surface and degenerate by disassembly. While axon degeneration is controlled by a conserved \"axon-death\" pathway that is thought to activate self-destruction, how PS exposure is regulated by this pathway and whether PS-induced phagocytosis contributes to neurite breakdown in vivo remain unknown. Here we show that in Drosophila sensory dendrites, PS exposure and self-destruction are triggered by two distinct levels of NAD+ reduction downstream of Sarm activation. Surprisingly, phagocytosis is the main driver of dendrite degeneration induced by both genetic NAD+ disruptions and injury. Furthermore, the axon-death factor Axed is only partially required for self-destruction of injured dendrites, acting in parallel with PS-induced phagocytosis. Lastly, injured dendrites exhibit a unique rhythmic calcium flashing that correlates with self-destruction. Therefore, a special genetic program coordinates PS exposure and self-destruction in injury-induced dendrite degeneration in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Anthracycline-based chemotherapy is a common treatment for cancer patients. Because it is delivered intravenously, endothelial cells are exposed first and to the highest concentrations, prior to diffusion to target cells. Not surprisingly, vascular dysfunction is a consequence of anthracycline therapy. While chemotherapy-induced endothelial damage at administration sites has been investigated, the effects of lower doses encountered by distant microvascular networks has not. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of epirubicin, a widely used anthracycline, on healthy endothelial cells to elucidate its effects on microvascular physiology.\n\nHere, endothelial cells were briefly exposed to low doses of epirubicin to recapitulate levels in circulation following dilution in the blood and compound half-life in circulation. Both immediate and prolonged responses to treatment were assessed to determine changes in endothelial function.\n\nEpirubicin caused a decrease in proliferation and viability in hUVEC, with lower doses resulting in a senescent phenotype in a large proportion of cells, accompanied by a significant increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines and a significant decrease in metabolic activity. Epirubicin exposure also impaired endothelial function with delayed wound closure, reduced angiogenic potential and increased monolayer permeability downstream of VE-cadherin internalization. Primary lung endothelial cells obtained from epirubicin-treated mice similarly demonstrated reduced viability and functional impairment. In vivo, epirubicin treatment resulted in persistent reduction in lung vascular density and significantly increased infiltration of myeloid cells.\n\nModulation of endothelial status and inflammatory tissue microenvironment observed in response to low doses of epirubicin may predict risk for long-term secondary pathologies associated with chemotherapy.",

Here, we have characterized and compared viral populations of SARS-CoV-2 among COVID-19 patients within and across households. Our work showed an active viral replication activity in the human respiratory tract and the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host. The inter-host comparison among viral populations further revealed a narrow transmission bottleneck between patients from the same households, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions.\n\nAuthor summaryIn this study, we compared SARS-CoV-2 populations of 13 Chinese COVID-19 patients. Those viral populations contained a considerable proportion of viral sub-genomic messenger RNAs (sgmRNA), reflecting an active viral replication activity in the respiratory tract tissues. The comparison of 66 identified intra-host variants further showed a low viral genetic distance between intra-household patients and a narrow transmission bottleneck size. Despite the co-existence of genetically distinct viruses within the same host, most intra-host minor variants were not shared between transmission pairs, suggesting a dominated role of stochastic dynamics in both inter-host and intra-host evolutions. Furthermore, the narrow bottleneck and active viral activity in the respiratory tract show that the passage of a small number of virions can cause infection. Our data have therefore delivered a key genomic resource for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission research and enhanced our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin is essential in all eukaryotes to maintain genome integrity, long-term gene repression and to help chromosome segregation during mitosis. However, heterochromatin regions must be restricted by boundary elements to avoid its spreading over actively transcribed loci. In Plasmodium falciparum, facultative heterochromatin is important to regulate parasite virulence, antigenic variation and transmission. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating repressive regions remain unknown. To investigate this topic, we chose the ap2-g gene, which forms a strictly delimited and independent heterochromatin island. Using electrophoretic motility shift assay (EMSA) we identified an ap2-g exon element at the 3 end binding nuclear protein complexes. Upon replacement of this region by a gfp gene, we observed a shift in the heterochromatin boundary resulting in HP1 (Heterochromatin Protein 1) spreading over [~]2 additional kb downstream. We used this DNA element to purify candidate proteins followed by proteomic analysis. The identified complexes were found to be enriched in RNA-binding proteins, pointing to a potential role of RNA in the regulation of the ap2-g 3 heterochromatin boundary. Our results provide insight into the unexplored topic of heterochromatin biology in P. falciparum and identify a DNA element within the master regulator of sexual commitment modulating heterochromatin spreading.",

    "abstract": "In budding yeast the Rif1 protein is important for protecting nascent DNA at blocked replication forks, but the mechanism has been unclear. Here we show that budding yeast Rif1 must interact with Protein Phosphatase 1 to protect nascent DNA. In the absence of Rif1, removal of either Dna2 or Sgs1 prevents nascent DNA degradation, implying that Rif1 protects nascent DNA by targeting Protein Phosphatase 1 to oppose degradation by the Sgs1-Dna2 nuclease-helicase complex. This functional role for Rif1 is conserved from yeast to human cells. Yeast Rif1 was previously identified as a target of phosphorylation by the Tel1/Mec1 checkpoint kinases, but the importance of this phosphorylation has been unclear. We find that nascent DNA protection depends on a cluster of Tel1/Mec1 consensus phosphorylation sites in the Rif1 protein sequence, indicating that the intra-S phase checkpoint acts to protect nascent DNA through Rif1 phosphorylation. Our observations uncover the pathway by which budding yeast Rif1 stabilises newly synthesised DNA, highlighting the crucial role Rif1 plays in maintaining genome stability from lower eukaryotes to humans.\n\nAuthor summaryGenome instability is a leading factor contributing to cancer. Maintaining efficient error-free replication of the genome is key to preventing genome instability. During DNA replication, replication forks can be stalled by external and intrinsic obstacles, leading to processing of nascent DNA ends to enable replication restart. However, the nascent DNA must be protected from excessive processing to prevent terminal fork arrest, which could potentially lead to more serious consequences including failure to replicate some genome sequences. Using a nascent DNA protection assay we have investigated the role of the budding yeast Rif1 protein at blocked replication forks. We find that Rif1 protects nascent DNA through a mechanism that appears conserved from yeast to humans. We show that budding yeast Rif1 protects nascent DNA by targeting Protein Phosphatase 1 activity to prevent degradation of nascent DNA by the Sgs1-Dna2 helicase-nuclease complex. Furthermore, we find that Rif1 phosphorylation by the checkpoint pathway during replication stress is crucial for this function. Our results indicate that the S phase checkpoint machinery acts by phosphorylating Rif1 to protect nascent DNA, providing important clues concerning the conserved role of Rif1 in regulating events when replication is challenged.",

Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF), is a major transcription factor involved in cellular response to low oxygen tension. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding regulatory sequences capable of post-translational modification of multiple genes. Present study aimed to identify common regulatory miRNAs of HIF gene family and coagulation pathway by In-silico approach in order to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the process of hypoxia induced coagulation.\n\nMethodsHIF family and Coagulation pathway genes along with their receptors and mediators were enlisted after comprehensive literature review. Thorough search of three highly cited database was done to identify the miRNAs targeting these genes. The extracted miRNA list was then prioritized on the basis of number and functional relevance of genes targeted. The target genes of all prioritized miRNAs were listed and subjected to followed by gene ontology (GO) study and pathway analysis.\n\nResultPresent In-silico analysis identified five candidate miRNAs, viz., hsa-mir-4433a-3p, hsa-mir-4667-5p, hsa-mir-6735-5p, hsa-mir-6777-3p and hsa-mir-6815-3p that co-regulate genes of HIF family and coagulation pathway. GO and pathway analysis revealed that genes regulated by these five microRNAs, predominantly modulate genes facilitating coagulation and hypoxic response.\n\nConclusionWe identified five key microRNAs involved in bodys response to hypoxia and potentially involved in the blood coagulation cascade as well.

    "abstract": "Protective immunity to parasitic infections has been difficult to elicit by vaccines. Among parasites that evade vaccine-induced immunity is Toxoplasma gondii, which causes lethal secondary infections in chronically infected mice. Here we report that unlike susceptible C57BL/6J mice, A/J mice were highly resistant to secondary infection. To identify correlates of immunity, we utilized forward genetics to identify Nfkbid, a nuclear regulator of NF-{kappa}B that is required for B cell activation and B-1 cell development. Nfkbid-null mice (bumble) did not generate parasite-specific IgM and lacked robust parasite-specific IgG, which correlated with defects in B-2 cell maturation and class-switch recombination. Though high-affinity antibodies were B-2 derived, transfer of B-1 cells partially rescued the immunity defects observed in bumble mice and were required for 100% vaccine efficacy in bone marrow chimeric mice. Immunity in resistant mice correlated with robust isotype class-switching in both B cell lineages, which can be fine-tuned by Nfkbid gene expression. We propose a model whereby humoral immunity to T. gondii is regulated by Nfkbid and requires B-1 and B-2 cells for full protection.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEukaryotic parasitic diseases account for approximately one fifth of all childhood deaths, yet no highly protective vaccine exists for any human parasite. More research must be done to discover how to elicit protective vaccine-induced immunity to parasitic pathogens. We used an unbiased genetic screen to find key genes responsible for immunity to the eukaryotic parasite Toxoplasma gondii. Our screen found Nfkbid, a transcription factor regulator, which controls B cell activation and innate-like B-1 cell development. Mice without Nfkbid were not protected against T. gondii and were deficient at making antibodies against the parasite. Our survival studies of vaccinated mice with and without B-1 compartments found that B-1 cells improved survival, suggesting that B-1 cells act in conjunction with B-2 cells to provide vaccine-induced immunity. Nfkbid and other loci identified in our unbiased screen represent potential targets for vaccines to elicit protective immune responses against parasitic pathogens.",

Here we have identified IL-27 as the cytokine specifically produced by murine B cells upon sequential stimulation by TLR ligands and then CD154 and IL-21, the hallmark factors of T follicular helper cells, and during the T-dependent antibody response to a conjugated hapten or virus infection. B-cell Il27p28 transcription is concomitant with increased locus accessibility and depends on newly induced BATF3 transcription factor. IL-27-producing B cells are inefficient in antibody secretion, but cooperate with IFN{gamma} to promote proliferation, survival, class-switching and plasma cell differentiation of CD40-activated B cells, leading to optimal IgG2a and IgG1 responses. Overall, IL-27-producing B cells function as \"helper\" B cells that integrate the innate and adaptive stages of the antibody response.\n\nOne-sentence summaryB cells integrate innate TLR and adaptive CD40 signals to induce BATF3 transcription factor for production of IL-27, which together with INFg optimizes antibody responses.",

    "abstract": "Genome editing is now widely used in plant science for both fundamental research and molecular crop breeding. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) technology, through its precision, high efficiency and versatility, allows to edit many sites in plant genomes. This system has been highly successful to produce of knock-out mutants through the introduction of frameshift mutations due to error-prone repair pathways. Nevertheless, recent new CRISPR-based technologies such as base editing and prime editing can generate precise and on request nucleotide conversion, allowing to fine-tune protein function and generate gain-of-function mutants. However, genome editing through CRISPR systems still have some drawbacks and limitations, such as the PAM restriction and the need for more diversity in CRISPR tools to simultaneously mediate different catalytic activities. In this study, we successfully used the CRISPR-Cas9 system from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9) for the introduction of frameshift mutations in the tetraploid genome of the cultivated potato (Solanum tuberosum). We also developed a S. aureus-cytosine base editor that mediate nucleotide conversions, allowing to precisely modify specific residues or regulatory elements in potato. Our proof-of-concept results in potato expand the plant dicot CRISPR toolbox for biotechnology and precision breeding applications.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The small LOV/F-box/Kelch family of E3 ubiquitin ligases plays an essential role in the regulation of plant circadian clocks and flowering time by sensing dusk. The family consists of three members, ZEITLUPE (ZTL), LOV KELCH PROTEIN 2 (LKP2), and FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT F-BOX PROTEIN 1 (FKF1), which share a unique protein domain architecture allowing them to act as photoreceptors that transduce light signals via altering stability of target proteins. Despite intensive study of this protein family we still lack important knowledge about the biochemical and functional roles of the protein domains that comprise these unique photoreceptors. Here, we perform comparative analyses of transgenic lines constitutively expressing the photoreceptor LOV domain or the Kelch repeat protein-protein interaction domains of ZTL, FKF1, and LKP2. Expression of each domain alone is sufficient to disrupt circadian rhythms and flowering time, but each domain differs in the magnitude of effect. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry with the ZTL Kelch repeat domain identified a suite of potential interacting partners. Furthermore, the ZTL Kelch repeat domain mediates interaction with the LOV domain of ZTL and the ZTL homologs LKP2 and FKF1. This suggests that the Kelch repeat domain of ZTL may mediate homo- and hetero-dimerization of the three LOV/F-box/Kelch proteins and provide added insight into the composition of the protein complexes and an additional role for the Kelch repeat domain.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Primates form strong social bonds and depend on social relationships and networks that provide shared resources and protection critical for survival. Social deficits such as those present in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other psychiatric disorders hinder the individual\u2019s functioning in communities. Given that early diagnosis and intervention can improve outcomes and trajectories of ASD, there is a great need for tools to identify early markers for screening/diagnosis, and for translational animal models to uncover biological mechanisms and develop treatments. One of the most widely used screening tools for ASD in children is the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), a quantitative measure used to identify individuals with atypical social behaviors. The SRS has been adapted for use in adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) \u2013a species very close to humans in terms of social behavior, brain anatomy/connectivity and development\u2013 but has not yet been validated or adapted for a necessary downward extension to younger ages matching those for ASD diagnosis in children. The goal of the present study was to adapt and validate the adult macaque SRS (mSRS) in juvenile macaques with age equivalent to 4-6 yr old human children. Expert primate coders modified the mSRS to adapt it to rate atypical social behaviors in juvenile macaques living in complex social groups at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center. Construct and face validity of this juvenile mSRS (jmSRS) was determined based on well-established and operationalized measures of social and non-social behaviors in this species using traditional behavioral observations. We found that the jmSRS identifies variability in social responsiveness of juvenile rhesus monkeys and shows strong construct/predictive validity, as well as sensitivity to detect atypical social behaviors in young male and female macaques across social status. Thus, the jmSRS provides a promising tool for translational research on macaque models of children social disorders.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Disrupted nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis; however, the mechanisms by which impaired NCT causes neurodegeneration remain unclear. In a Drosophila screen, we identified Ref(2)p/p62, a key regulator of autophagy, as a potent suppressor of neurodegeneration caused by the GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion (G4C2 HRE) in C9orf72 that causes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). We found that p62 is increased and forms ubiquitinated aggregates due to decreased autophagic cargo degradation. Immunofluorescence and electron microscopy of Drosophila tissues demonstrate an accumulation of lysosome-like organelles that precedes neurodegeneration. These phenotypes are partially caused by cytoplasmic mislocalization of Mitf/TFEB, a key transcriptional regulator of autophagolysosomal function. Additionally, TFEB is mislocalized and downregulated in human cells expressing GGGGCC repeats and in C9-ALS patient motor cortex. Our data suggest that the C9orf72-HRE impairs Mitf/TFEB nuclear import, thereby disrupting autophagy and exacerbating proteostasis defects in C9-ALS/FTD.",

    "abstract": "Microtubule plus end depolymerization rate is a potentially important target of physiological regulation, but it has been challenging to measure, so its role in spatial organization is poorly understood. Here we apply a method for tracking plus ends based on time difference imaging to measure depolymerization rates in large interphase asters growing in Xenopus egg extract. We observed strong spatial regulation of depolymerization rates, which were almost two-fold higher in the aster interior compared to the periphery, and much less regulation of polymerization or catastrophe rates. We interpret these data in terms of a limiting component model, where aster growth results in lower levels of soluble tubulin and MAPs in the interior cytosol compared to that at the periphery. The steady-state polymer fraction of tubulin was \u223c30%, so tubulin is not strongly depleted in the aster interior. We propose that the limiting component for microtubule assembly is a MAP that inhibits depolymerization, and that egg asters are tuned to low microtubule density.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

Here we show, using E. coli, that the scaling concept also rules cell size fluctuations under time-dependent conditions, even though the distribution changes with time. We develop a microfluidic device for observing dense and large bacterial populations, under uniform and switchable conditions. Triggering bacterial reductive division by switching to non-nutritious medium, we find that the cell size distribution changes in a specific manner that keeps its normalized form unchanged; in other words, scale invariance holds. This finding is underpinned by simulations of a model based on cell growth and intracellular replication. We also formulate the problem theoretically and propose a sufficient condition for the scale invariance. Our results emphasize the importance of intrinsic cellular replication processes in this problem, suggesting different distribution trends for bacteria and eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "In the human host blood Monocytes and bone marrow Megakaryocytes are implicated as major sites supporting high replication. The human K562 cell line supports DENV replication and represent Megakaryocyte-Erythrocyte progenitors (MEP), replicating features of in vivo Megakaryopoiesis upon stimulation with Phorbol esters. In this article, we report results that indicate the mutual influence of Megakaryopoiesis and DENV replication on each other, through comparison of PMA-induced differentiation of either mock-infected or DENV-infected K562 cells. We present data showing PMA-induced differentiation to drastically increase DENV replication and a concomitant augmented secretion of infectious virus. Although the mechanism is not clear yet, we show that it is not through an increased uptake of virus by differentiated cells. On the other hand, DENV replication in cells undergoing PMA-induced differentiation, interferes with major differentiation markers of Megakaryopoiesis including activation of ERK1/2 MAP Kinase, endomitosis and surface expression of platelet-specific proteins without any drastic effect on cell death. Among signaling intermediaries of the JAK-STAT pathway, we observed infection associated degradation of SOC3 protein similar to earlier observations with STAT2. DENV infection leads to accumulation of Reactive-oxygen species (ROS) in different cells including K562. PMA-induced differentiation of uninfected K562 cells also leads to intracellular ROS accumulation. Interestingly, we observed ROS accumulation to be suppressed by concomitant DENV replication in K562 cells undergoing PMA-induced differentiation. This is the first report of a model system where DENV replication suppresses intracellular ROS accumulation. The implications of these results for Megakaryopoiesis and viral replication would be discussed.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cell division is driven by a tubulin homolog FtsZ, which assembles into the Z-ring structure leading to the recruitment of the cell division machinery. In ovoid-shaped Gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococci, MapZ guides Z-ring positioning at cell equators through an, as yet, unknown mechanism. The cell wall of the important dental pathogen Streptococcus mutans is composed of peptidoglycan decorated with Serotype c Carbohydrates (SCCs). Here, we show that an immature form of SCC, lacking the recently identified glycerol phosphate (GroP) modification, coordinates Z-ring positioning. Pulldown assays using S. mutans cell wall combined with binding affinity analysis identified the major cell separation autolysin, AtlA, as an SCC binding protein. Importantly, AtlA binding to mature SCC is attenuated due to GroP modification. Using fluorescently-labeled AtlA, we mapped SCC distribution on the streptococcal surface to reveal that GroP-deficient immature SCCs are exclusively present at the cell poles and equators. Moreover, the equatorial GroP-deficient SCCs co-localize with MapZ throughout the S. mutans cell cycle. Consequently, in GroP-deficient mutant bacteria, proper AtlA localization is abrogated resulting in dysregulated cellular autolysis. In addition, these mutants display morphological abnormalities associated with MapZ mislocalization leading to Z-ring misplacement. Altogether, our data support a model in which GroP-deficient immature SCCs spatially coordinate the localization of AtlA and MapZ. This mechanism ensures cell separation by AtlA at poles and Z-ring alignment with the cell equator.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The blood-sucking hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus is a vector of Chagas disease, one of the most neglected tropical diseases affecting several million people, mostly in Latin America. The blood meal is an event with a high epidemiological impact since in adult mated females it initiates the production of hundreds of eggs. By means of RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) we have examined how a blood meal influences mRNA expression in the central nervous system (CNS), fat body and ovaries in order to promote egg production, focusing on tissue-specific responses under controlled nutritional conditions. We illustrate the cross talk between reproduction and a) lipids, proteins and trehalose metabolism, b) neuropeptide and neurohormonal signaling, and c) the immune system. Overall, our molecular evaluation confirms and supports previous studies and provides an invaluable molecular resource for future investigations on different tissues involved in successful reproductive events. Analyses like this can be used to increase the chances of developing novel strategies of vector population control by translational research, with less impact on the environment and more specificity for a particular organism.Author summary The blood-sucking hemipteran Rhodnius prolixus is one of the main vectors of Chagas disease. The blood meal is an event with a high epidemiological impact since in adult mated females, blood-gorging leads to the production of hundreds of eggs. This work describes an in-depth central nervous system (CNS), ovary and fat body transcriptome analysis, focusing on transcripts related to blood intake which may be relevant in promoting egg production. To date, the principle focus in Chagas disease prevention is on the elimination of triatomine vectors and their progeny. This work will serve as a starting point for initiating novel investigations on targets identified with a potential for use in vector control; for example using specific genes to generated symbiont-mediated RNAi, a powerful technology which provides a novel means in biocontrol against tropical disease vectors.View Full Text",

To address this, we introduce Cheetah - a flexible computational toolkit that simplifies the integration of real-time microscopy analysis with algorithms for cellular control. Central to the platform is an image segmentation system based on the versatile U-Net convolutional neural network. This is supplemented with functionality to robustly count, characterise and control cells over time. We demonstrate Cheetahs core capabilities by analysing long-term bacterial and mammalian cell growth and by dynamically controlling protein expression in mammalian cells. In all cases, Cheetahs segmentation accuracy exceeds that of a commonly used thresholding-based method, allowing for more accurate control signals to be generated. Availability of this easy-to-use platform will make control engineering techniques more accessible and offer new ways to probe and manipulate living cells.",

A high percentage of prediabetes subjects develops into type 2 diabetes mellitus in the following years. The effect of opioid peptides and their receptors, in addition to immunological cytokines on prediabetes, is not well understood.\n\nObjectiveWe hypothesize that opioid peptides and their receptors affect the insulin and the insulin resistance (IR) in patients with prediabetes and that the immune cytokines, IL-6 (inflammatory factor) and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory factor), influence the opioid system.\n\nMethodsA total of 60 patients with prediabetes and IR (prediabetes+IR), 60 patients with prediabetes without IR (prediabetes-IR), and 60 controls participated in the study. The IR state was HOMAIR > 2.5. The enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, - and {kappa}-opioid receptors (MOR and KOR), endomorphin-2 (EM2), and {beta}- endorphin ({beta}EP).\n\nResultsThe subjects with prediabetes had dyslipidemia, and not all of them underwent the IR state. The IL-6, IL-10, {beta}-endorphin, MOR, and endomorphin-2 were higher in the prediabetes subgroups compared with the control group. MOR was correlated with IL-10 and KOR. Prediabetes+IR can be predicted by the increased levels of the combination of IL-10, {beta}EP, and EM2 and by the combination of IL-10 and endomorphin-2/KOR with good sensitivity and specificity.\n\nConclusionOpioid peptides and their receptors were upregulated in patients with prediabetes depending on the significance of IR. These changes in the opioid system depend on the immune cytokines. Both systems need to be normalized to prevent further development into diabetes mellitus.",

    "abstract": "A label-free procedure to identify single amino acids (AAs) for protein sequencing is developed in theory and simulated in part. A terminal AA cleaved from a protein/peptide, a tRNA, its cognate amino-acyl tRNA synthetase (AARS), and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) are brought together in a container where tRNA, if cognate, gets charged with AA and adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is released. The released AMP (and any free AA and ATP molecules) filters into the cis chamber of an adjoining electrolytic cell (e-cell) from where they pass through a nanopore into the trans chamber. Addition of NaOH to the container deacylates the tRNA if it is charged. The resulting free AA passes into the cis chamber of the e-cell, translocates into trans, and causes a current blockade; AA is immediately known from the identity of the tRNA (the two are cognate). If the tRNA is not charged there is no AA bound to it so AA remains unidentified. In this approach there is no need to distinguish among the 20 AAs by blockade size; it suffices to distinguish blockades from noise: thus a high-precision analog measurement has been transformed into a low-precision binary one. Identification is accurate because of tRNA superspecificity (the tRNA charging error rate is < 1/350); parallel execution with 20 different tRNAs can identify AA in one cycle. This is a de novo method in which no prior information about the protein is used or needed.",

    "abstract": "Therapy resistance remains a major clinical challenge for the management of metastatic melanoma. Here we show that activation of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR), which we show is common in drug-tolerant and resistant melanoma, promotes selective synthesis of mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol. Since mitochondrial translation adapts to the influx of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, ISR activation indirectly enhances mitochondrial translation and makes these cells highly vulnerable to mitochondrial translation inhibitors. Treatment of melanoma with mitoribosome-targeting antibiotics, induces proteotoxic stress and significantly compromises the growth of NRAS-mutant and immunotherapy-resistant skin melanoma as well as uveal melanoma. Additionally, a triple BRAFi/MEKi/Tigecycline combination reduces intratumour heterogeneity by abrogating emergence of dedifferentiated drug-tolerant cells, and delayed or even prevented the development of resistance in BRAFV600E PDX models. Consistently, a melanoma patient exposed to Doxycycline, a mitoribosome-targeting antibiotic commonly used to treat infections, experienced a complete and long-lasting response of a treatment-resistant lesion.\n\nSignificanceOur study indicates that the repurposing of mitoribosome-targeting antibiotics offers a rational salvage strategy for targeted therapy in BRAF-mutant melanoma, and a therapeutic option to target NRAS-driven and immunotherapy-resistant cutaneous melanoma and uveal melanomas.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TE) are selfish genetic elements that can cause harmful mutations. In Drosophila, it has been estimated that half of all spontaneous visible marker phenotypes are mutations caused by TE insertions. Because of the harm posed by TEs, eukaryotes have evolved systems of small RNA-based genome defense to limit transposition. However, as in all immune systems, there is a cost of autoimmunity and small RNA-based systems that silence TEs can inadvertently silence genes flanking TE insertions. In a screen for essential meiotic genes in Drosophila melanogaster, a truncated Doc retrotransposon within a neighboring gene was found to trigger the germline silencing of ald, the Drosophila Mps1 homolog, a gene essential for meiosis. A subsequent screen for modifiers of this silencing identified a new insertion of a Hobo DNA transposon in the same neighboring gene. Here we describe how the original Doc insertion triggers flanking piRNA biogenesis and local gene silencing and how the additional Hobo insertion leads to de-silencing by reducing flanking piRNA biogenesis triggered by the original Doc insertion. These results support a model of TE-mediated silencing by piRNA biogenesis in cis that depends on local determinants of transcription. This may explain complex patterns of off-target gene silencing triggered by TEs within populations and in the laboratory. It also provides a mechanism of sign epistasis among TE insertions.\n\nAuthor SummaryTransposable elements (TEs) are selfish DNA elements that can move through genomes and cause mutation. In some species, the vast majority of DNA is composed of this form of selfish DNA. Because TEs can be harmful, systems of genome immunity based on small RNA have evolved to limit the movement of TEs. However, like all systems of immunity, it can be challenging for the host to distinguish self from non-self. Thus, TE insertions occasionally cause the small RNA silencing machinery to turn off the expression of critical genes. The rules by which this inadvertent form of autoimmunity causes gene silencing are not well understood. In this article, we describe a phenomenon whereby a TE insertion, rather than silencing a nearby gene, rescues the silencing of a gene caused by another TE insertion. This reveals a mode of TE interaction via small RNA silencing that may be important for understanding how TEs exert their effects on gene expression in populations and across species.",

    "abstract": "Infectiousness heterogeneity among individuals with tuberculosis (TB) is substantial and is likely to have a significant impact on the long-term dynamics of TB and the effectiveness of interventions. However, there is a gap in capturing heterogeneous infectiousness and evaluating its impact on the effectiveness of interventions.\n\nInformed by observed distribution of secondary infections, we constructed a deterministic model of TB transmission using ordinary differential equations. The model incorporated assumption of heterogeneous infectiousness with three levels of infectivity, namely non-spreaders, low-spreaders and super-spreaders. We evaluated the effectiveness of dynamic transmission untargeted and targeted implementation of an intervention intended to represent active case finding with a point-of-care diagnostic tool. The simulated intervention detected 20% of all TB patients who would otherwise have been missed by the health system during their disease episode and was compared across four epidemiological scenarios.\n\nOur model suggested that targeting the active case finding intervention towards super-spreaders was more effective than untargeted intervention in all setting scenarios, with more effectiveness in settings with low case detection and high transmission intensity. For instance, a targeted intervention achieved a 42.2% reduction in TB incidence, while the untargeted intervention achieved only a 20.7% reduction over 20 years, given the same number of people treated. Although the most marked impact on equilibrium TB incidence came from the rate of late reactivation, the proportion of super-spreaders and their relative infectiousness had shown substantial impact.\n\nTargeting active case-finding interventions to highly infectious cases likely to be particularly beneficial in settings where case detection is poor. Heterogeneity-related parameters had an equivalent effect to several other parameters that have been established as being very important to TB transmission dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Computer-aided drug discovery is an essential component of modern drug development. Therein, deep learning has become an important tool for rapid screening of billions of molecules in silico for potential hits containing desired chemical features. Despite its importance, substantial challenges persist in training these models, such as severe class imbalance, high decision thresholds, and lack of ground truth labels in some datasets. In this work we argue in favor of directly optimizing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in such cases, due to its robustness to class imbalance, its ability to compromise over different decision thresholds, certain freedom to influence the relative weights in this compromise, fidelity to typical benchmarking measures, and equivalence to positive/unlabeled learning. We also propose new training schemes (coherent mini-batch arrangement, and usage of out-of-batch samples) for cost functions based on the ROC, as well as a cost function based on the logAUC metric that facilitates early enrichment (i.e. improves performance at high decision thresholds, as often desired when synthesizing predicted hit compounds). We demonstrate that these approaches outperform standard deep learning approaches on a series of PubChem high-throughput screening datasets that represent realistic and diverse drug discovery campaigns on major drug target families.",

    "abstract": "Background Endocrine therapy is the most common treatment for estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, but its effectiveness is limited by high rates of primary and acquired resistance. There are likely many genetic causes and recent studies suggest the important role of ESR1 mutations and fusions in endocrine resistance. Previously we reported a recurrent ESR1 fusion called ESR1-CCDC170 in 6-8% of the luminal B breast cancers that has a worse clinical outcome after endocrine therapy. Despite being the most frequent ESR1 fusion, its functional role in endocrine resistance have not been studied in vivo, and the engaged mechanism and therapeutic relevance remain uncharacterized.Methods The endocrine sensitivities of HCC1428 or T47D breast cancer cells following genetic perturbations of ESR1-CCDC170 were assessed using clonogenic assays and/or xenograft mouse models. The underlying mechanisms were investigated by reverse phase protein array, western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. The sensitivity of ESR1-CCDC170 expressing breast cancer cells to concomitant treatments of tamoxifen and HER/SRC inhibitors was assessed by clonogenic assays.Results Our results suggested that different ESR1-CCDC170 fusions endow different levels of reduced endocrine sensitivity in vivo, resulting in significant survival disadvantages. Further investigation revealed a novel mechanism that ESR1-CCDC170 binds to HER2/HER3/SRC and activates SRC/PI3K/AKT signaling. Silencing of ESR1-CCDC170 in the fusion-positive cell line, HCC1428, downregulates HER2/HER3, represses pSRC/pAKT, and improves endocrine sensitivity. More important, breast cancer cells expressing ectopic or endogenous ESR1-CCDC170 are highly sensitive to treatment regimens combining endocrine agents with the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib and/or the SRC inhibitor dasatinib.Conclusion ESR1-CCDC170 may endow breast cancer cell survival under endocrine therapy via maintaining/activating HER2/HER3/SRC/AKT signaling which implies a potential therapeutic strategy for managing these fusion positive tumors.Competing Interest StatementDr. Rachel Schiff receives research funding from AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Gilead Sciences, and PUMA Biotechnology, outside of this project; and is a consulting/advisory committee member for Macrogenics, and Eli Lilly.

Despite the burden mis-localized mitochondrial precursors place on cells, our understanding of the systems that dispose of these proteins is incomplete. Here, we catalog the location and steady-state abundance of mitochondrial precursor proteins during mitochondrial impairment in S. cerevisiae. We find that a number of non-imported mitochondrial proteins localize to the nucleus, where they are eliminated by proteasome-based nuclear protein quality control. Recognition of mitochondrial precursors by the nuclear quality control machinery requires the presence of an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), and impaired breakdown of precursors leads to their buildup in nuclear-associated foci.

    "abstract": "Misassembled nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are removed by sealing off the surrounding nuclear envelope (NE), which is mediated by members of the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) machinery. Recruitment of ESCRT proteins to the NE is mediated by the interaction between the ESCRT member Chm7 and the inner nuclear membrane protein Heh1, which belongs to the conserved LEM family. Increased ESCRT recruitment results in excessive membrane scission at damage sites but its regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that Hub1-mediated alternative splicing of HEH1 pre-mRNA, resulting into its shorter form Heh1-S, is critical for the integrity of the NE. ESCRT-III mutants lacking Hub1 or Heh1-S display severe growth defects and accumulate improperly assembled NPCs. This depends on the interaction of Chm7 with the conserved MSC domain only present in the longer spliced variant Heh1-L. Heh1 variants assemble into heterodimers and we demonstrate that a unique splice segment in Heh1-S suppresses growth defects associated with uncontrolled interaction between Heh1-L and Chm7. Together, our findings reveal that Hub1-mediated splicing generates Heh1-S to regulate ESCRT recruitment to the nuclear envelope.\n\nSummary statementHeh1-S, the Hub1-mediated spliced version of HEH1 pre-mRNA, contributes to nuclear envelope maintenance by preventing excessive recruitment of Chm7.",

    "abstract": "We investigated genetic variation at 37 newly-developed microsatellite loci in populations of the tsetse fly Glossina fuscipes fuscipes captured from the upper and lower reaches of a single hydrographical network within an endemic Human African Trypanosomiasis focus. Our primary aim was to assess the impact of vector control using insecticide-treated baits (Tiny Targets) on genetic structure. We initially used STRUCTURE to delineate geographical boundaries of two stable  ancestral reference populations without any history of vector control but marked for either vector control ( intervention) or no control ( non-intervention). We then used the ADMIXTURE model to assess genetic divergence in temporal populations collected after vector control implementation. We applied the Linkage Disequilibrium method to explicitly measure spatial and temporal changes in effective population size (Ne). We observed a significant reduction in Ne coincident with vector control, whereas Ne remained stable in the non-intervention area. Our empirical findings show how classical population genetics approaches detected within a short period of time, a significant genetic bottleneck associated with vector control, and opens up the possibility of using routine genomic surveillance. We have also generated a resource of new genetic markers for studies on the population genetics of tsetse at finer-scale resolution.\n\nFundingThis work was funded through a Wellcome Trust Masters Fellowship in Public Health and Tropical Medicine awarded to Allan Muhwezi (103268/Z/13/Z).",

However, large scale discovery of noncoding events altering the gene expression regulatory program has been limited to a few examples with high recurrence or high functional impact.\n\nResultsWe focused on transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) that show similar mutation loads than what is observed in protein-coding exons. By combining cancer somatic mutations in TFBSs and expression data for protein-coding and miRNA genes, we evaluated the combined effects of transcriptional and post-transcriptional alteration on the dysregulation of the regulatory programs in cancer. The analysis of seven cancer cohorts culminated with the identification of protein-coding and miRNA genes linked to mutations at TFBSs that were associated with a cascading trans-effect deregulation on the cells regulatory program. Our analyses of cis-regulatory mutations associated with miRNAs recurrently predicted 17 miRNAs as pan-cancer-associated through deregulation of their target gene networks. Overall, our predictions were enriched for protein-coding and miRNA genes previously annotated as cancer drivers. Functional enrichment analyses highlighted that cis-regulatory mutations are associated with the dysregulation of key pathways associated with carcinogenesis\n\nConclusionsThese pan-cancer results suggest that our method predicts cis-regulatory mutations related to the dysregulation of key gene regulatory networks in cancer patients.

    "abstract": "Disturbed blood lipid profiles after food intake have been associated with increased risk for cardiovascular and metabolic disease. Postprandial lipid profiling (PLP) can be used as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, insulin resistance and other metabolic diseases but is based today on frequent blood sampling over several hours after a meal, an approach that is invasive and inconvenient for patients. Non-invasive PLP may offer a favorable alternative for disseminated monitoring in humans. In this study, we investigate the use of localized lipid sensing guided by Multispectral Optoacoustic Tomography (MSOT) for non-invasive, label-free assessment of postprandial lipemia in human vasculature and in soft tissues. For penetrating deep in human tissue, we utilize measurements at 930 nm, where lipids exhibit strong light absorption in the near-infrared spectral range (NIR). In a pilot study, we longitudinally measured postprandial lipemia in healthy subjects over 6 hours following consumption of a high-fat meal. Localized measurements were obtained from four anatomical structures: the radial artery, the cephalic vein, the brachioradialis muscle and the subcutaneous fat of the forearm. Analysis of optoacoustic signals demonstrated a 63.4% mean lipid increase in intra-arterial lipids at approximately 4 hours postprandially, a 89.7% mean increase in intra-venous lipids at 3-hours, a 120.8% mean increase in intra-muscular lipids at 3-hours and a 30.5% mean increase in subcutaneous fat lipids at 4-hours. We discuss how portable MSOT offers unprecedented potential to study lipid metabolism that could lead to novel diagnostics and prevention strategies by offering label-free and non-invasive detection of tissue biomarkers implicated in cardiometabolic diseases.Competing Interest StatementV.

    "abstract": "Sub-nucleosomal complexes including hexasomes and tetrasomes have been identified as intermediates in nucleosome assembly and disassembly. Their formation is promoted by certain histone chaperones and ATP-dependent remodelers, as well as through transcription by RNA polymerase II. In addition, hexasomes appear to be maintained in transcribed genes and could be an important regulatory factor. While nucleosome composition affects the structure and accessibility of the nucleosomal DNA, its influence on the histone tails is largely unknown. Previously, we found that the H3 tail accessibly is occluded in the context of the nucleosome due to interactions with DNA (Morrison et al, 2018). Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics of the H3 tail in the hexasome and tetrasome. Using a combination of NMR spectroscopy, MD simulations, and trypsin proteolysis, we find that the conformational ensemble of the H3 tail is regulated by nucleosome composition. Similar to what we previously found for the nucleosome, the H3 tails bind robustly to DNA within the hexasome and tetrasome, but upon loss of the H2A/H2B dimer, we determined that the adjacent H3 tail has an altered conformational ensemble, increase in dynamics, and increase in accessibility. Similar to observations of DNA dynamics, this is seen to be asymmetric in the hexasome. Our results indicate that nucleosome composition has the potential to regulate chromatin signaling at the histone tails and ultimately help shape the chromatin landscape.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "3D single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) is an emerging superresolution method for structural cell biology, as it allows probing precise positions of proteins in cellular structures. Supercritical angle fluorescence strongly depends on the z-position of the fluorophore and can be used for z localization in a method called supercritical angle localization microscopy (SALM). Here, we realize the full potential of SALM by directly splitting supercritical and undercritical emission, using an ultra-high NA objective, and applying new fitting routines to extract precise intensities of single emitters, resulting in a four-fold improved z-resolution compared to the state of the art. We demonstrate nanometer isotropic localization precision on DNA origami structures, and on clathrin coated vesicles and microtubules in cells, illustrating the potential of SALM for cell biology.",

    "abstract": "SummarySingle cell RNA sequencing is an evolving field to elucidate cellular architecture of adult organs. Using normal breast tissues from healthy volunteers and a rapid procurement/processing/sequencing protocol, 13 breast epithelial cell clusters were identified. Approximately 90% of breast cancers were enriched for cell-of-origin signatures derived from differentiated luminal clusters and two minor luminal progenitor clusters. Expression of cell cycle and chromosome segregation-related genes were higher in one of the minor clusters and breast tumors with this cluster signature displayed the highest mutation rate and poor outcome. We identified TBX3 and PDK4 as genes co-expressed with estrogen receptor (ER) in the normal breasts and their expression analyses in &gt;550 breast cancers enabled prognostically relevant cell-of-origin based subclassification of ER+ breast cancers.Significance This study elucidates different epithelial cell types of the normal breasts and identifies a minor subpopulation of cells from which the majority of breast cancers may originate. This observation should help to develop methods to characterize breast tumors based on cell-of-origin. Although it was suggested that intrinsic subtypes of breast cancers have distinct cells of origins, this study suggests multiple cell-of-origin for an intrinsic subtype of breast cancer, including for hormone responsive breast cancers. Cell-of-origin signatures allowed survival-associated subclassification of intrinsic subtypes. Critically, this normal breast cell atlas would allow for the classification of genes differentially expressed in a breast tumor compared to normal breast due to the cell-of-origin of tumor and those that are acquired due to genomic aberrations.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Deficiencies in mitochondrial import cause the toxic accumulation of non-imported mitochondrial precursor proteins. Numerous fates for non-imported mitochondrial precursors have been identified, including proteasomal destruction, deposition into protein aggregates, and mis-targeting to other organelles. Amongst organelles, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has emerged as a key destination for non-imported mitochondrial proteins, but how ER-targeting of these proteins is achieved remains unclear. Here, we show that the guided entry of tail-anchored proteins (GET) complex is required for ER-targeting of endogenous mitochondrial multi-transmembrane proteins. Without a functional GET pathway, non-imported mitochondrial proteins destined for the ER are alternatively sequestered into Hsp42-dependent protein foci. The ER targeting of non-imported mitochondrial proteins by the GET complex prevents cellular toxicity and facilitates re-import of mitochondrial proteins from the ER via the recently identified ER-SURF pathway. Overall, this study outlines an important and unconventional role for the GET complex in mitigating stress associated with non-imported mitochondrial proteins.",

    "abstract": "Most mammalian stem cells undergo cellular division during their differentiation to produce daughter cells with a new cellular identity. However, the cascade of epigenetic events and molecular mechanisms occurring between successive cell divisions upon differentiation have not yet been described in detail due to technical limitations. Here, we address this question by taking advantage of the Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) reporter to develop a culture system allowing the differentiation of human Embryonic Stem Cells (hESCs) synchronised for their cell cycle. Using this approach, we have assessed the epigenome and transcriptome dynamics during the first two divisions leading to definitive endoderm. We first observed that transcription of key markers of differentiation occurs before division suggesting that differentiation is initiated during the progression of cell cycle. Furthermore, ATAC-seq shows a major decrease in chromatin accessibility after pluripotency exit indicating that the first event of differentiation is the inhibition of alternative cell fate. In addition, using digital genomic footprinting we identified novel cell cycle-specific transcription factors with regulatory potential in endoderm specification. Of particular interest, Activator protein 1 (AP-1) controlled p38/MAPK signalling seems to be necessary for blocking endoderm shifting cell fate toward mesoderm lineage. Finally, histone modifications analyses suggest a temporal order between different marks. We can also conclude that enhancers are dynamically and rapidly established / decommissioned between different cell cycle upon differentiation. Overall, these data not only reveal key the successive interplays between epigenetic modifications during differentiation but also provide a valuable resource to investigate novel mechanisms in germ layer specification.",

We identify previously unknown niche compartments and show that long implicated slow-cycling cells form separate lineages in the outer limbus, with only local clonal dynamics. Instead, we find distinct stem cells in the pericorneal limbus to be required for corneal regeneration.

    "abstract": "Transgressive segregation is common in plant breeding populations, where a small minority of recombinants are outliers relative to parental phenotypes. While this phenomenon has been attributed to complementation and epistatic effects, the physiological, biochemical, and molecular bases have not been fully illuminated. By systems-level scrutiny of the IR29 x Pokkali recombinant inbred population of rice, we addressed the hypothesis that novel salt tolerance phenotypes are created by positive or negative coupling or uncoupling effects and novel regulatory networks. Hyperspectral profiling distinguished the transgressive individuals in terms of stress penalty to growth. Non-parental network signatures that led to either optimal or non-optimal integration of developmental with stress-related mechanisms were evident at the macro-physiological, biochemical, metabolic, and transcriptomic levels. The large positive net gain in super-tolerant progeny was due to ideal complementation of beneficial traits, while shedding antagonistic traits. Super-sensitivity was explained by the stacking of multiple antagonistic traits and loss of major beneficial traits. The mechanisms elucidated in this study are consistent with the Omnigenic Theory, emphasizing the synergy or lack thereof between core and peripheral components. This study supports a breeding paradigm based on genomic modeling to create the novel adaptive phenotypes for the crops of the 21st century.",

Previous studies suggest multiple transitions from insect to wind pollination within this genus, in association with polyploidy and unisexual flowers, but the underlying genes remain unknown. We generated a draft reference genome for Thalictrum thalictroides, a representative of a clade with ancestral floral traits (diploidy, hermaphroditism, and insect pollination) and a model for functional studies. To facilitate candidate gene discovery in flowers with different sexual and pollination systems we also generated floral transcriptomes of T. thalictroides and of wind-pollinated, andromonoecious (staminate and hermaphroditic flowers on the same plant) T. hernandezii.\n\nThe T. thalictroides draft genome assembly consisted of 44,860 contigs (N50=12,761 bp. and 243 Mbp. total length) and contained 84.5% conserved embryophyte single-copy genes. Floral transcriptomes from Illumina sequencing and de novo assembly contained representatives of most eukaryotic core genes (approximately 80%), with most of their genes falling into common orthologous groups (orthogroups). Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) motifs were also identified, which together with the single-copy genes constitute a resource for population-level or phylogenetic studies. Finally, to validate the utility of these resources, putative candidate genes were identified for the different floral morphologies using stepwise dataset comparisons. In conclusion, we present genomic and transcriptomic resources for Thalictrum, including the first genome of T. thalictroides and potential candidate genes for flowers with distinct sexual and pollination systems.",

    "abstract": "Luminal epithelial cells (LEps) are a key cell lineage implicated in age-related luminal breast cancers. Alterations to the epigenome are a hallmark of aging cells. However, the extent of age-associated DNA methylation alterations in LEps, and the corresponding functional consequences of these alterations, have remained unclear. We report here that aging leads to distinct methylation changes in LEps. Luminal lineage-specific genes gain promoter methylation, whereas myoepithelial-specific genes lose promoter methylation. Regulatory elements display methylation changes at lineage-specific TF binding sites consistent with the loss of lineage fidelity. CpG islands (CGIs) and transposable elements (TEs) have stochastic methylation gain and loss, respectively. PRC2 target genes that are hypermethylated in luminal breast cancer exhibit stochastic methylation increase with age. TEs with stochastic methylation loss are activated in breast cancer and potentially function as regulatory elements contributing to the loss of lineage fidelity with age. Each of these classes of methylation changes impact the regulation of genes associated with luminal breast cancer. Altogether, our results indicate that aging leads to DNA methylation changes that could determine breast cancer susceptibility.\n\nSignificanceMammary luminal epithelial cells lose lineage-specific expression with age and accumulate stochastic methylation changes that lead to loss of silencing at transposable elements.

    "abstract": "BackgroundImputation accuracy among other things depends on the size of the reference panel, the markers minor allele frequency (MAF), and the correct placement of variants on the reference genome assembly. Using high-density genotypes of 3938 Nellore cattle from Brazil, we investigated the accuracy of imputation from 50K to 777K SNP density, using map positions determined according to the bovine genome assemblies UMD3.1 and ARS-UCD1.2. We assessed the effect of reference and target panel sizes on the pre-phasing-based imputation quality using ten-fold cross-validation. Further, we compared the reliability of the model-based imputation quality score (Rsq) from Minimac3 to empirical imputation accuracy.\n\nResultsThe overall accuracy of imputation measured as the squared correlation between true and imputed allele dosages (R2dose) was virtually identical using either the UMD3.1 or ARS-UCD1.2 genome assembly. When the size of the reference panel increased from 250 to 2000, R2dose increased from 0.845 to 0.917, and the number of polymorphic markers in the imputed data set increased from 586,701 to 618,660. Advantages in both accuracy and marker density were also observed when larger target panels were imputed, likely resulting from more accurate haplotype inference. Imputation accuracy and the marker density in the imputed data increased from 0.903 to 0.913 and from 593,239 to 595,570 when haplotypes were inferred in 500 and 2900 target animals, respectively. The model-based imputation quality scores from Minimac3 (Rsq) were highly correlated to but systematically higher than empirically estimated accuracies. The correlation between these metrics increased with the size of the reference panel and MAF of imputed variants.\n\nConclusionsAccurate imputation of BovineHD BeadChip markers is possible in Nellore cattle using the new bovine reference genome assembly ARS-UCD1.2. The use of large reference and target panels improves the accuracy of the imputed genotypes and provides genotypes for more markers segregating at low frequency for downstream genomic analyses. The model-based imputation quality score from Minimac3 (Rsq) can be used to detect poorly imputed variants but its reliability depends on the size of the reference panel used and MAF of the imputed variants.",

    "abstract": "High-risk strains of human papillomavirus are causative agents for cervical and other mucosal cancers with type 16 being the most frequent. Compared to the European Prototype (A1, denoted \"EP\"), the Asian-American (D2/D3, denoted \"AA\") sub-lineage or \"variant\" is reported to have increased abilities to promote carcinogenesis. Few global interactome studies have looked at protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between host proteins and variants of the key transforming E6 protein. We applied a primary human foreskin keratinocyte model transduced with EP and AA variant E6 genes and co-immunoprecipitated expressed E6 proteins along with interacting cellular proteins to detect virus-host binding partners. We reasoned that, due to single nucleotide polymorphisms, AAE6 and EPE6 may have unique PPIs with host cellular proteins--conferring gain or loss of function--resulting in varied abilities to promote carcinogenesis. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and stringent interactor selection criteria based on the number of peptides, we identified 25 candidates: 6 unique to each of AAE6 and EPE6, along with 13 E6 targets common to both AAE6 and EPE6. We also applied a more inclusive process based on pathway selection and discovered 171 target proteins: 90 unique AAE6 and 61 unique EPE6 along with 20 common E6 targets between the two sub-lineages. Interpretations for both approaches were made using databases such as UniProt, BioGRID and Reactome. Detected E6 targets are implicated in important hallmarks of cancer: deregulating Notch and other signaling, energetics and hypoxia, DNA replication and repair, and immune response. Validation experiments, such as reverse co-immunoprecipitation and RNA interference, are required to substantiate these findings. Here, we provide an unprecedented resource for new research questions in HR HPV biology. The current data also underline our labs driving hypothesis that E6, being a \"master regulator\" in HPV-positive cancers, is an excellent candidate for anti-cancer treatment strategies.\n\nAuthor SummaryChronic infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 is the most prevalent cause of cervical and other mucosal cancers. The E6 oncoproteins of the European Prototype (EP) and the Asian-American (AA) HPV variants differentially promote carcinogenesis. We looked at protein-protein interactions between host proteins and two key HPV variant E6 proteins of these strains to reveal how high risk HPVs cause cancer, based on the proteins they bind to in infected cells. Our methodology combined molecular biology and data mining techniques using widely available databases. We confirmed and discovered novel virus-host associations that explained how HPV AA and EP variants differ in their carcinogenic capabilities, and confirmed the candidacy of the E6 protein as a viable target for HPV therapies.",

    "abstract": "The precise timing of neuronal activity is critical for normal brain function. In weakly electric fish, the medullary pacemaker network (PN) sets the timing for an oscillating electric organ discharge (EOD) used for electric sensing. This network is the most precise biological oscillator known, with sub-microsecond variation in oscillator period. The PN consists of two principle sets of neurons, pacemaker and relay cells, that are connected by gap junctions and normally fire in synchrony, one-to-one with each EOD cycle. However, the degree of gap junctional connectivity between these cells appears insufficient to provide the population averaging required for the observed temporal precision of the EOD. This has led to the hypothesis that individual cells themselves fire with high precision, but little is known about the oscillatory dynamics of these pacemaker cells. To this end, we have developed a biophysical model of a pacemaker neuron action potential based on experimental recordings. We validated the model by comparing the changes in oscillatory dynamics produced by different experimental manipulations. Our results suggest that a relatively simple model captures the complex dynamics exhibited by pacemaker cells, and that these dynamics may enhance network synchrony and precision.\n\nAuthor summaryMany neural networks in the brain exhibit activity patterns which oscillate regularly in time. These oscillations, like a clock, can provide a precise sense of time, enabling drummers to maintain complex beat patterns and pets to anticipate \"feeding time\". The exact mechanisms by which brain networks give rise to these biological clocks are not clear. The pacemaker network of weakly electric fish has the highest precision of all known biological clocks. In this study, we develop a detailed biophysical model of neurons in the pacemaker network. We then validate the model against experiments using a nonlinear dynamics approach. Our results show that pacemaker precision is due, at least in part, to how individual pacemaker cells generate their activity. This supports the idea that temporal precision in this network is not solely an emergent property of the network but also relies on the dynamics of individual neurons.",

    "abstract": "We consider the Pavlovian eyeblink conditioning (EBC) via repeated presentation of paired conditioned stimulus (tone) and unconditioned stimulus (airpuff). The influence of various temporal recoding of granule cells on the EBC is investigated in a cerebellar network where the connection probability pc from Golgi to granule cells is changed. In an optimal case of [Formula], individual granule cells show various well- and ill-matched firing patterns relative to the unconditioned stimulus. Then, these variously-recoded signals are fed into the Purkinje cells (PCs) through parallel-fibers (PFs), and the instructor climbing-fiber (CF) signals from the inferior olive depress them effectively. In the case of well-matched PF-PC synapses, their synaptic weights are strongly depressed through strong long-term depression (LTD). On the other hand, practically no LTD occurs for the ill-matched PF-PC synapses. This type of \"effective\" depression at the PF-PC synapses coordinates firings of PCs effectively, which then make effective inhibitory coordination on cerebellar nucleus neuron [which elicits conditioned response (CR; eyeblink)]. When the learning trial passes a threshold, acquisition of CR begins. In this case, the timing degree [T]d of CR becomes good due to presence of the ill-matched firing group which plays a role of protection barrier for the timing. With further increase in the trial, strength [S] of CR (corresponding to the amplitude of eyelid closure) increases due to strong LTD in the well-matched firing group, while its timing degree [T]d decreases. In this way, the well- and the ill-matched firing groups play their own roles for the strength and the timing of CR, respectively. Thus, with increasing the learning trial, the (overall) learning efficiency degree [L]e (taking into consideration both timing and strength of CR) for the CR is increased, and eventually it becomes saturated. By changing pc from [Formula], we also investigate the influence of various temporal recoding on the EBC. It is thus found that, the more various in temporal recoding, the more effective in learning for the Pavlovian EBC.",

    "abstract": "To achieve their therapeutic effect on the brain, molecules need to pass the blood-brain-barrier (BBB). Many pharmacological treatments of neuropathologies encounter the BBB as a barrier, hindering their effective use. Pharmaceutical nanotechnology based on optimal physicochemical features and taking advantage of naturally occurring permeability mechanisms, nanocarriers such as liposomes offer an attractive alternative to allow drug delivery across the BBB. Liposomes are spherical bilayer lipid-based nanocapsules that can load hydrophilic molecules in their inner compartment and on their outer surface can be functionally modified by peptides, antibodies and polyethyleneglycol (PEG). When composed of cationic lipids, liposomes can serve as gene delivery devices, encapsulating and protecting genetic material from degradation and promoting nonviral cell transfection. In this study, we aimed to develop a liposomal formulation to encapsulate a plasmid harbouring brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and infuse these liposomes via the peripheral bloodstream into the brain. To this end, liposomes were tagged with PEG, transferrin, and arginine and characterized regarding their physical properties, such as particle size, zeta-potential and polydispersity index (PDI). Moreover, we selected liposomes preparations for plasmid DNA (pDNA) encapsulation and checked for loading efficiency, in vitro cell uptake, and transfection. The preliminary results from this pilot study revealed that we were able to replicate the liposomes synthesis described in literature, achieving compatible size, charge, PDI, and loading efficiency. However, we could not properly determine whether the conjugation of the surface ligands transferrin and arginine to PEG worked and whether they were attached to the surface of the liposomes. Additionally, we were not able to see transfection in SH-SY5Y cells after 24 or 48 hours of incubation with the pDNA loaded liposomes. In conclusion, we synthesized liposomes encapsulation pBDNF, however, further research will be necessary to address the complete physicochemical characterization of the liposomes. Furthermore, preclinical studies will be helpful to verify transfection efficiency, cytotoxicity, and in the future, safe delivery of BDNF through the BBB.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTHow aquatic insects cope with cold temperatures is poorly understood. This is particularly true for high-elevation species that often experience a seasonal risk of freezing. In the Rocky Mountains, nemourid stoneflies (Plecoptera: Nemouridae) are a major component of mountain stream biodiversity and are typically found in streams fed by glaciers and snowfields, which due to climate change, are rapidly receding. Predicting the effects of climate change on mountain stoneflies is difficult because their thermal physiology is largely unknown. We investigated cold tolerance of several alpine stoneflies (Lednia tumana, Lednia tetonica, and Zapada spp.) from the Rocky Mountains, USA. We measured the supercooling point (SCP) and tolerance to ice enclosure of late-instar nymphs collected from a range of thermal regimes. SCPs varied among species and populations, with the lowest SCP measured for nymphs from an alpine pond, which is much more likely to freeze solid in winter than flowing streams. We also show that L. tumana cannot survive being enclosed in ice, even for short periods of time (less than three hours) at relatively mild temperatures (\u22120.5 \u00b0C). Our results indicate that high-elevation stoneflies at greater risk of freezing may have correspondingly lower SCPs, and despite their common association with glacial meltwater, they appear to be living near their lower thermal limits.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Brassica napus is an important oilseed crop cultivated worldwide. During domestication and breeding of B. napus, flowering time has been a target of selection because of its substantial impact on yield. Here we use double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (ddRAD) to investigate the genetic basis of flowering in B. napus. An F2 mapping population was derived from a cross between an early-flowering spring type and a late-flowering winter type. Flowering time in the mapping population differed by up to 25 days between individuals. High genotype error rates persisted after initial quality controls, as suggested by a genotype discordance of \u223c12% between biological sequencing replicates. After genotype error correction, a linkage map spanning 3,605.70 cM and compromising 14,630 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was constructed. A quantitative trail locus (QTL) on chromosome C2 was detected in the vicinity of flowering time genes including FT and FLC. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the ddRAD approach to sample the B. napus genome. Our results also suggest that ddRAD genotype error rates can be higher than expected in F2 populations. Quality filtering and genotype correction and imputation can substantially reduce these error rates and allow effective linkage mapping and QTL analysis.Competing Interest StatementBASF supported this work and employs SR.View Full Text",

We explore apple fruit development through the growing season to establish the point at which the features differentiating those cultivars become evident. This is relevant both for the understanding of the growing process and to ensure that any identification and classification tools can be used both on ripened-on-tree and stored fruit. Current literature presents some contradictory findings on apple development, we explored the size development of 12 apple cultivars in the Brogdale National Fruit Collection, UK over two growing seasons.Methods Fruit were sampled at regular time points throughout the growing season and four morphometrics (maximum length, maximum diameter, weight, and centroid size) were collected. These were regressed against growing degree days in order to appropriately describe the growth pattern observed.Results All four morphometrics were adequately described using log-log linear regressions, with adjusted R2 estimates ranging from 78.3% (maximum length) to 86.7% (weight). For all four morphometrics, a 10% increase in growing degree days was associated with a 1% increase in the morphometric measurement.Discussion Our findings refine previous work presenting rapid early growth followed by a plateau in later stages of development and are in disagreement with published expo-linear models. We established that apples harvested for commercial storage purposes, two weeks prior to maturity, showed only a modest decrease in size, demonstrating that size morphometric approaches are appropriate for classification of apples, both ripened-on-tree and stored.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Gene vectors driven by tumour-specific promoters to express reporter genes and therapeutic genes are an emerging approach for improved cancer diagnosis and treatment. Minicircles (MCs) are shortened plasmids stripped of prokaryotic sequences and have potency and safety characteristics that are beneficial for clinical translation. We previously developed survivin-driven, tumour-activatable MCs for cancer detection via a secreted blood reporter assay. Here we present a novel theranostic system for prostate cancer featuring a pair of survivin-driven MCs, combining selective detection of aggressive tumours via a urinary reporter test and subsequent tumour treatment with gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy.\n\nMethodsWe engineered both diagnostic and therapeutic survivin-driven MCs expressing Gaussia luciferase, a secreted reporter that is detectable in the urine, and cytosine deaminase:uracil phosphoribosyltransferase fusion, respectively. Diagnostic MCs were evaluated in mice carrying orthotopic prostate tumours with varying survivin levels, measuring reporter activity in serial urine samples. Therapeutic MCs were evaluated in mice receiving prodrug using bioluminescence imaging to assess cancer cell viability over time.\n\nResultsDiagnostic MCs revealed mice with aggressive prostate tumours exhibited significantly higher urine reporter activity than mice with non-aggressive tumours and tumour-free mice. Combined with 5-fluorocytosine prodrug treatment, therapeutic MCs resulted in reduced bioluminescence signal in mice with aggressive prostate tumours compared to control mice.\n\nConclusionSequential use of these MCs may be used to first identify patients carrying aggressive prostate cancer by a urinary reporter test, followed by stringent treatment in stratified individuals identified to have high-risk lesions. This work serves to highlight tumour-activatable MCs as a viable platform for development of gene-based tumour-activatable theranostics.",

    "abstract": "One of the most fundamental challenges for all living organisms is to sense and respond to alternating nutritional conditions in order to adapt their metabolism and physiology to promote survival and achieve balanced growth. Here, we applied metabolomics and lipidomics to examine temporal regulation of metabolism during starvation in wildtype Caenorhabditis elegans and in animals lacking the transcription factor HLH-30. Our findings show for the first time that starvation alters the abundance of hundreds of metabolites and lipid species in a temporal- and HLH-30-dependent manner. We demonstrate that premature death of hlh-30 animals under starvation can be prevented by supplementation of exogenous fatty acids, and that HLH-30 is required for complete oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. We further show that RNAi-mediated knockdown of the gene encoding carnitine palmitoyl transferase I (cpt-1) only impairs survival of wildtype animals and not of hlh-30 animals. Strikingly, we also find that compromised generation of peroxisomes by prx-5 knockdown renders hlh-30 animals hypersensitive to starvation, which cannot be rescued by supplementation of exogenous fatty acids. Collectively, our observations show that mitochondrial functions are compromised in hlh-30 animals and that hlh-30 animals rewire their metabolism to largely depend on functional peroxisomes during starvation, underlining the importance of metabolic plasticity to maintain survival.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/170555v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a7339borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12d36b0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1615d6aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13bfaa8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Exploring structural and functional variations of the parasites through the intraerythrocytic stages and their impact on red blood cell (RBCs) is a cornerstone of antimalarial drug development. In order to trace such changes in fine steps of parasite development, we performed an imaging study of RBCs infected by Plasmodium falciparum, using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRF), further supplemented with bright field microscopy for the direct assignment of the stages. This multifaceted imaging approach allows to reveal structure-functionality relations via correlations of the parasite maturation with morphological and fluorescence properties of the stages. We established identification patterns characteristic to the different parasite stages based on the height profile of infected RBCs, as obtained by AFM, which show close correlation with typical fluorescence (TIRF) maps of RBCs. Furthermore, we found that hemozoin crystals exhibit a strong optical contrast by quenching fluorescence. We demonstrate that these topographic and optical features also provide a tool to locate the hemozoin crystals within the RBCs and, in turn, to follow their growth.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTMetabolism and signaling intersect in the genetic cancer syndrome hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC), a disease in which mutation of the TCA cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH) causes hyperaccumulation of fumarate. This electrophilic oncometabolite can alter gene activity at the level of transcription, via reversible inhibition of epigenetic dioxygenases, as well as posttranslationally, via covalent modification of cysteine residues. To better understand how metabolites function as covalent signals, here we report a chemoproteomic analysis of a kidney-derived HLRCC cell line. Building on previous studies, we applied a general reactivity probe to compile a dataset of cysteine residues sensitive to rescue of cellular FH activity. This revealed a broad upregulation of cysteine reactivity upon FH rescue, caused by an approximately equal proportion of transcriptional and posttranslational regulation in the rescue cell line. Gene ontology analysis highlights new targets and pathways potentially modulated by FH mutation. Comparison of the new dataset to literature studies highlights considerable heterogeneity in the adaptive response of cysteine-containing proteins in different models of HLRCC. Our analysis provides a resource for understanding the proteomic adaptation to fumarate accumulation, and a foundation for future efforts to exploit this knowledge for cancer therapy.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

One option is to interfere with the formation of lipid-laden \u201cfoamy\u201d macrophages in the infected host. Here, we provide evidence that WNT6, a member of the evolutionary conserved WNT signaling pathway, promotes foam cell formation by regulating key lipid metabolic genes including acetyl-CoA carboxylase-2 (ACC2) during pulmonary TB. In addition, we demonstrate that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) facilitates its intracellular growth and dissemination in the host by exploiting the WNT6-ACC2 pathway. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we show that lack of functional WNT6 or ACC2 significantly reduces intracellular TAG levels, Mtb growth and necrotic cell death of macrophages. In combination with the anti-TB drug isoniazid, pharmacological inhibition of ACC2 improved anti-mycobacterial treatment in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, we propose the WNT6-ACC2 signaling pathway as a promising target for a host-directed therapy to reduce intracellular replication of Mtb by modulating neutral lipid metabolism.Competing Interest StatementDrs.
