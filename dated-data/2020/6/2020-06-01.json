    "abstract": "Protein ubiquitination at sites of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by RNF168 recruits BRCA1 and 53BP1, mediators of the homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DSB repair pathways, respectively. While NHEJ relies on 53BP1 binding to ubiquitinated Lysine 15 on H2A-type histones (H2AK15ub), an RNF168-dependent modification, the mechanism linking RNF168 to BRCA1 recruitment during HR has remained unclear. Here, we identify a tandem BRCT domain ubiquitin-dependent recruitment motif (BUDR) in BARD1 - BRCA1s obligate partner protein - that binds H2AK15ub directly, thereby recruiting BRCA1 to DSBs. BARD1 BUDR mutations compromise HR, and render cells hypersensitive to PARP inhibition and cisplatin treatment. We find that BARD1-nucleosome interactions require BUDR binding to H2AK15ub and ankyrin repeat domain-mediated binding of the histone H4 tail, specifically when unmethylated on Lysine-20 (H4K20me0), a state limited to post replicative chromatin. Finally, we demonstrate that by integrating DNA damagedependent H2AK15ub and DNA replication-dependent H4K20me0 signals at sites of DNA damage, BARD1 coordinates BRCA1-dependent HR with 53BP1 pathway antagonization, establishing a simple paradigm for the governance of DSB repair pathway choice.",

    "abstract": "During the current century, each major coronavirus outbreak has triggered a quick and immediate surge of academic publications on this topic. The spike in research publications following the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (Covid-19) outbreak, however, has been like no other. The global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has mobilised scientific efforts in an unprecedented way. In less than five months, more than 12,000 research items have been indexed while the number increasing every day. With the crisis affecting all aspects of life, research on Covid-19 seems to have become a focal point of interest across many academic disciplines. Here, scientometric aspects of the Covid-19 literature are analysed and contrasted with those of the two previous major Coronavirus diseases, i.e. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Certain recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct and major cohort of studies: (i) studies linked to the public health response and epidemic control, (ii) studies associated with the chemical constitution of the virus and (iii) studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies affiliated with the category (i) seem to have been the first to emerge, they overall received least numbers of citations compared to those of the two other categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been distributed across a broader variety of journals and subject areas. Clear links are observed between the geographical origins of each outbreak or the local geographical severity of each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19 studies also display the involvement of authors from a broader variety of countries compared to SARS and MRS.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Use of organic manures to meet the nutrient requirement of crop would be an inevitable practice in the years to come for sustainable agriculture since organic manures generally improve the soil physical, chemical and biological properties. Hence, field experiments were carried out in 2017 and 2018 to compare the impact of different organic manures and NPK fertilizer on soil properties, growth, yield, proximate and mineral contents of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus L.). The treatments each year 2017 and 2018 consisted of: rabbit manure, cow dung, poultry manure, green manure [Mexican sunflower (Tithonia diversifolia Asteraceae)], pig manure, NPK 15-15-15 fertilizer applied at 120 kg N ha-1 and a control (no manure/ inorganic fertilizer). The seven treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replication. Organic manures and NPK fertilizer increased the soil organic matter (OM), N, P, K, Ca and Mg (NPK fertilizer did not increase OM, Ca and Mg significantly), growth, yield, minerals, protein, ash, carbohydrate and mucilage contents of okra fruit as compared with control. Organic manures improved okra yield compared with NPK fertilizer. Okra growth and yield parameters were significantly higher in 2018 compared with 2017. Control, rabbit manure, cow dung, poultry manure, green manure, pig manure and NPK fertilizer in 2018 increased the pod yield of okra by 9.7%, 35.3%, 57.9%, 36.2%, 39.2%, 45.5% and 3.2%, respectively compare with the same treatment in 2017. Amongst various organic manures, poultry manure produced significantly higher plant growth, yield, mineral and proximate composition of okra because of its high soil chemical properties which could be related to its lowest C: N ratio, lignin and lignin: N ratio. Results also showed that okra grown during high intensity rainfall has higher yield but with reduced quality except its mucilage content. Therefore, planting of okra with poultry manure under moderate rainfall will enhance the health benefit from the fruit, however, those that desire its mucilage content planting during high rainfall is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax malaria is a neglected tropical disease in Africa due to low occurrence rates and lack of accurate diagnosis. Recently, there has been a dramatic increase in P. vivax cases in East Africa and reportedly spreading to western countries. This study investigated the geographical origin and genetic diversity of P. vivax in Sudan by 14 microsatellite markers. A total of 113 clinical P. vivax samples were collected from two districts, New Halfa and Khartoum in Sudan. In addition, data from 841 geographical samples retrieved from the database for global genetic analysis were included in the analysis to further the genetic relationships among the P. vivax isolates at regional and worldwide scales. On a regional scale, we observed 91 unique and 8 shared haplotypes amongst the Sudan samples. Such a high genetic diversity compared to other geographical isolates lends support to hypothesis that P. vivax was originated from Africa. On a global scale, as already demonstrated, we observed distinct genetic clustering of P. vivax isolates from Africa, South America, and Asia (including Papua New Guinea and Solomon Island) with limited admixture in all three clusters. The principal component analysis and phylogenetic tree showed similar clustering patterns and highlighted the contribution of the African isolates to the genetic variation observed globally. The East African P. vivax showed similarity with some of the Asian isolates suggesting potential recent introductions. Our results show extensive genetic diversity co-occurring with significant multi-locus linkage disequilibrium, demonstrating the effectiveness of using microsatellite markers to implement effective control measures.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionBacterial meningitis is medical emergency that requires immediate medical attention. It is a cause of an estimated 288, 649 deaths worldwide per year, of which 94 883 death occur among Under-five children. Up to 24% of the survivors suffer from long-term sequelae such as epilepsy, mental retardation, or sensorineural deafness especially when the disease is contracted during early childhood.\n\nObjectivethe aim of this study was to assess bacterial isolates of CSF sample and their antimicrobial resistance patterns among under-five children in Dilla University Referral Hospital.\n\nMaterial and MethodsHospital based cross-sectional study design was used to collect clinical data and CSF sample from under-five children who was suspected for meningitis. Sediment of CSF sample was inoculated to Blood Agar plate, Chocolate Agar plate and Mackonkey Agar for bacterial isolation and identification. Chemical analysis and cytological analysis was also conducted based on standard operating procedures.\n\nResultsFrom a total of 287 CSF sample cultured, causative bacteria were detected in 38 (13.2%). From culture positive cases the most frequent isolate was Streptococcus pneumoniae 13 (34.2%) followed by Staphylococcus aureas 7 (18.4%), Neisseria meningitidis 6 (16%) and Escherichia coli 6 (16%). Haemophilus influenzae b was isolated in 4 (10.5%) of children with meningitis. The other cause of meningitis was Streptococcus agalactiae which accounted (10.5%). Cryptococcus neoformans have been detected in 4 (1.9%) cases of meningitis. Of all bacterial isolates about 42.1% (16/38) bacterial isolates were multidrug resistant. About 38.5% of S. pneumoniae was multidrug resistance while about 33.3% N. meningitis, 50% of H. influenzae, 57.1% of S. aureas and 40% of E. coli showed multidrug resistance\n\nConclusionsHigh prevalence of bacterial meningitis and high rate of drug resistance were observed. S. pneumoniae was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis among under-five children.",

    "abstract": "Information theory has become an essential tool of modern neuroscience. It can however be difficult to apply in experimental contexts when acquisition of very large datasets is prohibitive. Here, we compare the relative performance of two information theoretic measures, mutual information and transfer entropy, for the analysis of information flow and energetic consumption at synapses. We show that transfer entropy outperforms mutual information in terms of reliability of estimates for small datasets. However, we also show that a detailed understanding of the underlying neuronal biophysics is essential for properly interpreting the results obtained with transfer entropy. We conclude that when time and experimental conditions permit, mutual information might provide an easier to interpret alternative. Finally, we apply both measures to the study of energetic optimality of information flow at thalamic relay synapses in the visual pathway. We show that both measures recapitulate the experimental finding that these synapses are tuned to optimally balance information flowing through them with the energetic consumption associated with that synaptic and neuronal activity. Our results highlight the importance of conducting systematic computational studies prior to applying information theoretic tools to experimental data.\n\nAuthor summaryInformation theory has become an essential tool of modern neuroscience. It is being routinely used to evaluate how much information flows from external stimuli to various brain regions or individual neurons. It is also used to evaluate how information flows between brain regions, between neurons, across synapses, or in neural networks. Information theory offers multiple measures to do that. Two of the most popular are mutual information and transfer entropy. While these measures are related to each other, they differ in one important aspect: transfer entropy reports a directional flow of information, as mutual information does not. Here, we proceed to a systematic evaluation of their respective performances and trade-offs from the perspective of an experimentalist looking to apply these measures to binarized spike trains. We show that transfer entropy might be a better choice than mutual information when time for experimental data collection is limited, as it appears less affected by systematic biases induced by a relative lack of data. Transmission delays and integration properties of the output neuron can however complicate this picture, and we provide an example of the effect this has on both measures. We conclude that when time and experimental conditions permit, mutual information - especially when estimated using a method referred to as the  direct method - might provide an easier to interpret alternative. Finally, we apply both measures in the biophysical context of evaluating the energetic optimality of information flow at thalamic relay synapses in the visual pathway. We show that both measures capture the original experimental finding that those synapses are tuned to optimally balance information flowing through them with the concomitant energetic consumption associated with that synaptic and neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and has emerged as global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to elevated markers of cardiac injury associated with higher risk of mortality in COVID-19 patients. It is unclear whether cardiac injury may have been caused by direct infection of cardiomyocytes or is mainly secondary to lung injury and inflammation. Here we investigate whether human cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nMethodsInfection was induced by two strains of SARS-CoV-2 (FFM1 and FFM2) in human induced pluripotent stem cells-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CM) and in two models of human cardiac tissue.\n\nResultsWe show that SARS-CoV-2 infects hiPS-CM as demonstrated by detection of intracellular double strand viral RNA and viral spike glycoprotein protein expression. Increasing concentrations of virus RNA are detected in supernatants of infected cardiomyocytes, which induced infections in CaCo-2 cell lines documenting productive infections. SARS-COV-2 infection induced cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic effects and abolished cardiomyocyte beating. RNA sequencing confirmed a transcriptional response to viral infection as demonstrated by the up-regulation of genes associated with pathways related to viral response and interferon signaling, apoptosis and reactive oxygen stress. SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiotoxicity was confirmed in a iPS-derived human 3D cardiosphere tissue models. Importantly, viral spike protein and viral particles were detected in living human heart slices after infection with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nConclusionsThe demonstration that cardiomyocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro warrants the further in depth monitoring of cardiotoxic effects in COVID-19 patients.\n\nClinical PerspectiveO_ST_ABSWhat is New?C_ST_ABSO_LIThis study demonstrates that human cardiac myocytes are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nC_LIO_LIThe study documents that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes a full replicatory circle and induces a cytotoxic response in cardiomyocytes.\nC_LIO_LIInfection was confirmed in two cardiac tissue models, including living human heart slices.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the Clinical Implications?O_LIThe study may provide a rational to explain part of the cardiotoxicity observed in COVID-19 patients\nC_LIO_LIThe demonstration of direct cardiotoxicity induced by SARS-CoV-2 warrants an in depth further analysis of cardiac tissue of COVID-19 patients and a close monitoring for putative direct cardiomyocyte injury.\nC_LIO_LIThe established models can be used to test novel therapeutic approaches targeting COVID-19.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Citizen science (CS) currently refers to some level of volunteer participation in any discipline of scientific research. Over the last two decades, nature-based CS has flourished due to innovative technology, novel devices, and widespread digital platforms used to collect and classify species occurrence data. For scientists, CS offers a low-cost approach of collecting species occurrence information at large spatial scales that otherwise would be prohibitively expensive. We examined the trends and gaps linked to the use of CS as a source of data for species distribution models (SDMs), in order to propose guidelines and highlight solutions. We conducted a quantitative literature review of 224 peer-reviewed articles to measure how the representation of different taxa, regions, and data types have changed in SDM publications since the 2010s. Our review shows that the number of papers using CS for SDMs has increased at approximately double the rate of the overall number of SDM papers. However, disparities in taxonomic and geographic coverage remain in studies using CS. Western Europe and North America were the regions with the most coverage (71.2%). Papers on birds (51.2%) and mammals (26.2%) outnumbered other taxa. Among invertebrates, flying insects including Lepidoptera and Odonata received the most attention. Compared to studies on animal taxa, papers on plants using CS data remain rare. Although the aims and scope of SDM papers are diverse, conservation remained the central theme of SDM using CS data. We present examples of the use of CS and highlight recommendations to motivate further research, such as combining multiple data sources and promoting local and traditional knowledge. We hope our findings will strengthen citizen-researchers partnerships to better inform SDMs, especially for less-studied taxa and regions. Researchers stand to benefit from the large quantity of data available from CS sources to improve global predictions of species distributions.",

However, few studies have applied synchrony to predict collaborative learning quality in real classroom. This study collected electrodermal activity (EDA) and heart rate (HR) in naturalistic class sessions, and compared the physiological synchrony between independent task and group discussion task. Since each student learn differently and not everyone prefers collaborative learning, participants were sorted into collaboration and independent dyads based on collaborative behaviors before data analysis. The result showed that during groups discussions, high collaboration pairs produced significantly higher synchrony than low collaboration dyads (p = 0.010). Given the equivalent engagement level during independent and collaborative tasks, the difference of physiological synchrony between high and low collaboration dyads was triggered by collaboration quality. Building upon this result, the classification analysis was conducted, indicating that EDA synchrony can predict collaboration quality (AUC = 0.767, p = 0.015).",

The snowball sampling was employed to recruit the participants. The data were analyzed using STATA version 14. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the level of knowledge and practices.Results The majority of the respondents (80.35%) were male. The overall prevention knowledge of the participants towards the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was high. About 91.2% of the participant was heard about the novel coronavirus disease and Social Medias\u2019 were the main source of the information. About 90% of the participants had a good prevention knowledge of maintaining social distance and frequent hand washing. The practices of the participants towards the COVID-19 prevention were very low. Out of 341 participants, only 61% and 84% of the participants were practicing social distance and frequent hand washing, respectively.Conclusions Majority of the participants had knew the ways of protecting themselves from the novel coronavirus. But, there was deficiencies of changing these prevention knowledge to practice. This indicates that there was gap between knowledge and implementation of prevention strategies in the community. The concerned body should focus on providing education for the community regarding the implementation of the prevention knowledge to practice.AbbreviationsFFNCFamily, friends, neighbor, and colleaguesMoHMinistry of HealthSARSSevere Acute Respiratory SyndromeMERSMiddle East Respiratory SyndromeWHOWorld Health OrganizationView Full Text",

    "abstract": "Cattle (bovine species) are economically and ecologically very important and are cosmopolitan in distribution. Increasing number of cattle on the urban streets of developing and underdeveloped countries has become an unmanageable menace in recent time. Consequently numbers of road accidents have increased in the urban areas of most of the developing countries, like India. In the present study, we estimated the population of street cattle wandering on the street/road/highway of Raipur city of India using direct head count method and advanced Photographic Capture Recapture Method (PCRCM). We compared these two scientific methods of population estimation to check their adequacy. We prepared grid (1.0 x 1.0 km) on the map of Raipur city using Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) software and randomly selected 20 grids for the estimation of street cattle population. We used line transects and block count methods for data sampling. Results of direct head count method indicated an estimation of 11808.45 cattle (using line transects sampling method) and 11198.30 cattle (using block counting sampling method) visibly roaming on the street of Raipur city. Further, advanced PCRCM indicated an estimation of 35149.61 cattle using line transects sampling method and 34623.20 cattle using block counting sampling method. We observed female biased sex ratio in both mature and immature cattle. Frequency of mature cattle was significantly higher than that of immature cattle followed by calves. Further, the frequency of cattle in a grid was found in the following order: cow > bull > heifer > immature male > female calve > male calve. We concluded that the estimated population of street cattle in Raipur city is about 34623. Results of both the techniques, i.e., direct head count method and PCRCM for population estimation are consistent. The direct head count method yields the number of cattle visibly roaming on the street in a particular time; whereas advanced PCRCM gives the total population of street cattle in the city. Results of this study might be helpful in the management of street cattle menace in urban habitat and landscape.",

    "abstract": "Root growth potential (RGP) is a popular physiological indicator used to evaluate seedling vigor. However, the time scale used in the RGP test is the order of days, which leads to poor performance of the RGP method. We propose an optical interference method, called statistical interferometry, to measure minute root elongation at a sub-nanometer scale, which can decrease the time used in measuring RGP. The time scale of this method is also 104 times less than that of the RGP method. Because we can measure the length of root elongation continuously, we can compute the root elongation rate (RER), which is the variety of the length of root elongation per second. Continuous monitoring can help determine the quality of Masson pine seedling as soon as possible. To show the effectiveness of our proposed method, we designed an experiment, in which we applied different water stresses to our collected Masson pine seedlings and acquired two groups of pines, representing two different qualities: one stressed by water and one not. After measuring the RER of the groups in our experiments, we found that RER is interrelated with the quality of seedlings.\n\nAuthor summaryLi Wang have worked in Nanjing Forest University.

    "abstract": "Introduction Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) taken by People Living with HIV (PLHIV) protects against tuberculosis (TB). Despite its recommendation, there is scarcity of data on the uptake of IPT among PLHIV and factors associated with treatment outcomes. We aimed to determine the proportion of PLHIV initiated on IPT, IPT treatment outcomes and screening for TB during and after IPT.Methods A retrospective cohort study of a representative sample of PLHIV initiated on IPT between July 2015 and June 2018 in Kenya. We abstracted information on socio-demographic, TB screening practices, IPT initiation, follow up, and outcomes from health facilities\u2019 patient record cards, IPT cards and IPT registers. Further, we assessed baseline characteristics as potential correlates of developing TB during and after treatment and IPT completion using multivariable logistic regression.Results We enrolled 138,442 PLHIV into ART during the study period and initiated 95,431 (68.9%) into IPT. Abstracted files for 4708 patients initiated on IPT, out of which 3891(82.6%) had IPT treatment outcomes documented, 4356(92.5%) had ever been screened for TB at every clinic visit and 4,243(90.1%) had documentation of TB screening on the IPT tool before IPT initiation. 3712(95.4%) of patients with documented IPT treatment outcomes completed their treatment. 42(0.89%) of the abstracted patients developed active TB, 16(38.1%) during and 26(61.9%) after completing IPT. Follow up for TB at 6-month post-IPT completion was done for 2729(73.5%) of patients with IPT treatment outcomes. Sex, Viral load suppression and clinic type were associated with TB development (p&lt;0.05). Levels 4, 5, FBO, and private facilities and IPT prescription practices were associated with IPT completion (p&lt;0.05).Conclusion Two-thirds of PLHIV were initiated on IPT, with a high completion rate. TB screening practices were better during IPT than after completion. Development of TB during and after IPT emphasises need for keen follow up.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Spatial biological networks are abundant on all scales of life, from single cells to ecosystems, and perform various important functions including signal transmission and nutrient transport. These biological functions depend on the architecture of the network, which emerges as the result of a dynamic, feedback-driven developmental process. While cell behavior during growth can be genetically encoded, the resulting network structure depends on spatial constraints and tissue architecture. Since network growth is often difficult to observe experimentally, computer simulations can help to understand how local cell behavior determines the resulting network architecture. We present here a computational framework based on directional statistics to model network formation in space and time under arbitrary spatial constraints. Growth is described as a biased correlated random walk where direction and branching depend on the local environmental conditions and constraints, which are presented as 3D multilayer grid. To demonstrate the application of our tool, we perform growth simulations of a dense network between cells and compare the results to experimental data from osteocyte networks in bone. Our generic framework might help to better understand how network patterns depend on spatial constraints, or to identify the biological cause of deviations from healthy network function.\n\nAuthor summaryWe present a novel modeling approach and computational implementation to better understand the development of spatial biological networks under the influence of external signals. Our tool allows us to study the relationship between local biological growth parameters and the emerging macroscopic network function using simulations. This computational approach can generate plausible network graphs that take local feedback into account and provide a basis for comparative studies using graph-based methods.",

    "abstract": "There has been a long-standing debate about whether categories are represented by individual category members (exemplars) or by the central tendency abstracted from individual members (prototypes). Across neuroimaging studies, there has been neural evidence for either exemplar representations or prototype representations, but not both. In the present study, we asked whether it is possible for individuals to form multiple types of category representations within a single task. We designed a categorization task to promote both exemplar and prototype representations, and we tracked their formation across learning. We found evidence for co-existing prototype and exemplar representations in brain in regions that aligned with previous studies: prototypes in ventromedial prefrontal cortex and anterior hippocampus and exemplars in inferior frontal gyrus and lateral parietal cortex. These findings show that, under the right circumstances, individuals may form representations at multiple levels of specificity, potentially facilitating a broad range of future memory-based decisions.",

    "abstract": "Reliably predicting sustainable exploitation levels for many tropical species subject to hunting remains a difficult task, largely because of the inherent uncertainty associated with estimating parameters related to both population dynamics and hunting pressure. Here, we investigate a modelling approach to support decisions in bushmeat management which explicitly considers parameter uncertainty. We apply the approach to duiker Cephalophus spp., assuming either a constant quota-based, or a constant proportional harvesting, strategy. Within each strategy, we evaluate different hunting levels in terms of both average yield and survival probability, over different time horizons. Under quota-based harvesting, considering uncertainty revealed a trade-off between yield and extinction probability that was not evident when ignoring uncertainty. The highest yield was returned by a quota that implied a 40% extinction risk, whereas limiting extinction risk to 10% reduced yield by 50%-70%. By contrast, under proportional harvesting, there was no trade-off between yield and extinction probability. The maximum proportion returned a yield comparable with the maximum possible under quota-based harvesting, but with extinction risk below 10%. However, proportional harvesting can be harder to implement in practice because it depends on an estimate of population size. In both harvesting approaches, predicted yields were highly right-skewed with median yields differing from mean yields, implying that decision outcomes depend on attitude to risk. The analysis shows how an explicit consideration of all available information, including uncertainty, can, as part of a wider process involving multiple stakeholders, help inform harvesting policies.",

    "abstract": "Paraquat (PQ) is a highly lethal herbicide. Ingestion of large quantities of PQ usually results in cardiovascular collapse and eventually death. However, the mechanism of acute PQ poisoning induced cardiotoxicity is poorly understood. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to aim to investigate the mechanisms of PQ induced cardiotoxicity by examining the effects of PQ on hemodynamics in vivo, as well as in vitro on isolated hearts and ventricular myocytes in rats. Intravenous administration of PQ (100 or 180 mg/kg) in anesthetized rats induced dose-dependent decreases in heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac contractility (left ventricular [LV] dP/dtmax). Furthermore, it prolonged the rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval. In Langendorff-perfused isolated hearts, PQ (33 or 60 \u03bcM) decreased LV pressure and contractility (LV dP/dtmax in isolated ventricular myocytes), PQ (10\u201360 \u03bcM) decreased the amplitude of Ca2+ transients and cell shortening in a concentration-dependent manner. Patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that PQ decreased the amplitude and availability of the transient outward K+ channel (Ito) and altered its gating kinetics. These results suggest that PQ-induced cardiotoxicity results mainly from diminished Ca2+ transients and inhibited K+ channels, which lead to the suppression of LV contractile force and prolongation of the QTc interval.View Full Text",
