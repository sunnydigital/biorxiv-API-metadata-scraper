    "abstract": "Unicellular eukaryotic phytoplankton, such as diatoms, rely on microbial communities for survival despite lacking specialized compartments to house microbiomes (e.g., animal gut). Microbial communities have been widely shown to benefit from diatom excretions that accumulate within the microenvironment surrounding phytoplankton cells, known as the phycosphere. However, mechanisms that enable diatoms and other unicellular eukaryotes to nurture specific microbiomes by fostering beneficial bacteria and repelling harmful ones are mostly unknown. We hypothesized that diatom exudates may attune microbial communities and employed an integrated multi-omics approach using the ubiquitous diatom Asterionellopsis glacialis to reveal how it modulates its naturally associated bacteria. We show that A. glacialis reprograms its transcriptional and metabolic profiles in response to bacteria to secrete a suite of central metabolites and two unusual secondary metabolites, rosmarinic acid and azelaic acid. While central metabolites are utilized by potential bacterial symbionts and opportunists alike, rosmarinic acid promotes attachment of beneficial bacteria to the diatom and simultaneously suppresses the attachment of opportunists. Similarly, azelaic acid enhances growth of beneficial bacteria, while simultaneously inhibiting growth of opportunistic ones. We further show that the bacterial response to azelaic acid is widespread in the worlds oceans and taxonomically restricted to a handful of bacterial genera. Our results demonstrate the innate ability of an important unicellular eukaryotic group to modulate their microbial consortia, similar to higher eukaryotes, using unique secondary metabolites that regulate bacterial growth and behavior inversely in different bacterial populations.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments on extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing multiple virus particles challenge the rigid definition of non-enveloped viruses. However, how non-enveloped viruses hijack cell machinery to promote non-lytic release in EVs, and their functional roles, remain to be clarified. Here we used Bluetongue virus (BTV) as a model of a non-enveloped arthropod-borne virus and observed that the majority of viruses are released in EVs, both in vitro and in the blood of infected animals. Based on the cellular proteins detected in these EVs, and use of inhibitors targeting the cellular degradation process, we demonstrated that these extracellular vesicles are derived from secretory lysosomes, in which the acidic pH is neutralized upon the infection. Moreover, we report that secreted EVs are more efficient than free-viruses for initiating infections, but that they trigger super-infection exclusion that only free-viruses can overcome.\n\nAuthor summaryRecent discoveries of non-enveloped virus secreted in EVs opened the door to new developments in our understanding of the transmission and pathogenicity of these viruses. In particular, how these viruses hijack the host cellular secretion machinery, and the role of these EVs compared with free-virus particles remained to be explored. Here, we tackled these two aspects, by studying BTV, an emerging arthropod-borne virus causing epidemics worldwide. We showed that this virus is mainly released in EVs, in vivo and in the blood of infected animals, and that inhibition of the cell degradation machinery decreases the release of infectious EVs, but not free-virus particles. We found that BTV must neutralize the pH of lysosomes, which are important organelles of the cell degradation machinery, for efficient virus release in EVs. Our results highlight unique features for a virus released in EVs, explaining how BTV transits in lysosomes without being degraded. Interestingly, we observed that EVs are more infectious than free-virus particles, but only free-viruses are able to overcome the super-infection exclusion, which is a common cellular defense mechanism. In conclusion, our study stresses the dual role played by both forms, free and vesicular, in the virus life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Doxycycline (DOX) is a key antimalarial drug thought to kill Plasmodium parasites by blocking protein translation in the essential apicoplast organelle. Clinical use is primarily limited to prophylaxis due to delayed second-cycle parasite death at 1-3 M serum concentrations. DOX concentrations >5 M kill parasites with first-cycle activity but have been ascribed to off-target mechanisms outside the apicoplast. We report that 10 M DOX blocks apicoplast biogenesis in the first cycle and is rescued by isopentenyl pyrophosphate, an essential apicoplast product, confirming an apicoplast-specific mechanism. Exogenous iron rescues parasites and apicoplast biogenesis from first-but not second-cycle effects of 10 M DOX, revealing that first-cycle activity involves a metal-dependent mechanism distinct from the delayed-death mechanism. These results critically expand the paradigm for understanding the fundamental antiparasitic mechanisms of DOX and suggest repurposing DOX as a faster-acting antimalarial at higher dosing whose multiple mechanisms would be expected to limit parasite resistance.",

    "abstract": "The recent spread of Zika virus (ZIKV) and its association with congenital defects and neurological disorders has created an urgent need to understand the pathogenesis of ZIKV and identify therapeutic strategies that will prevent or eliminate them. The neurodevelopmental defects associated with ZikV infections early in pregnancy are well documented, however the potential defects associated with infections in late pregnancy and perinatal period are less well characterized. Further, the long-term sequelae of these infections are not fully understood. Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice infected at one day old (P1), which neurodevelopmentally model late pregnancy in humans, develop a transient neurological syndrome including unsteady gait, kinetic tremors, severe ataxia and seizures 10-15 days post-infection (dpi) but symptoms subside after a week, and most animals survive. Despite apparent recovery, MRI of convalescent mice shows reduced cerebellar volume that correlates with altered coordination and motor function as well as hyperactivity and impulsivity. Persistent mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes including Cd80, Il-1, and Ifn-{gamma} together with Cd3, Cd8 and perforin (PrfA), suggested the persistence of a low-grade inflammatory process. Further, the brain parenchyma of convalescent mice harbor multiple small foci with viral antigen, active apoptotic processes in neurons, and cellular infiltrates, surrounded by activated astrocytes and microglia as late as 1-year post-infection. Detection of negative-sense strand viral RNA and replication of virus derived from these convalescent mice by blinded passage in Vero cells confirmed that low levels of live ZikV persist in CNS of convalescent mice life-long. Our studies establish that Zika can establish reservoirs in CNS and suggest that anti-viral treatment that clears virus from the CNS as well as long-term neurological and behavioral monitoring may be needed for patients known to be exposed to ZikV at an early age.\n\nAuthors summaryThe congenital brain malformations associated with ZikV infections early in pregnancy are well documented, however whether apparently asymptomatic perinatal exposure could lead to long term sequelae is not fully understood. Using a non-lethal neonatal mouse model, we examine host-pathogen interactions, anatomical changes and behavioral patterns by following survivors of the acute infection for over 1 year. We discover that infectious Zika virus has the potential to remain in the CNS for life, lodged within small foci surrounded by gliosis and infiltrating immune cells that may act to limit the viral spread, but also interfere with healing and contribute to life-long neuropathic and behavioral sequelae. These results suggest that anti-viral treatment and long-term neurological and behavioral monitoring may be indicated for patients known to have been exposed to Zika virus, regardless of neurodevelopmental disease severity.",

    "abstract": "RNA helices are often punctuated with non-Watson-Crick features that can be the target of chemical compounds, but progress towards identifying small molecules specific for non-canonical elements has been slow. We have used a tandem UU:GA mismatch motif (5-UG-3:5-AU-3) embedded within the helix of an RNA hairpin as a model to identify compounds that bind the motif specifically. The three-dimensional structure of the RNA hairpin and its interaction with a small molecule compound identified through a virtual screen are presented. The G-A of the mismatch forms a sheared pair upon which the U-U base pair stacks. The hydrogen bond configuration of the U-U pair involves the O2 of the U adjacent to the G and the O4 of the U adjacent to the A. The G-A and U-U pairs are flanked by A-U and G-C base pairs, respectively, and the mismatch exhibits greater stability than when the motif is within the context of other flanking base pairs or when the 5-3 orientation of the G-A and U-U is swapped. Residual dipolar coupling constants were used to generate an ensemble of structures against which a virtual screen of 64,480 small molecules was performed to identify candidate compounds that the motif specifically binds. The tandem mismatch was found to be specific for one compound, 2-amino-1,3-benzothiazole-6-carboxamide, which binds with moderate affinity but extends the motif to include the flanking A-U and G-C base pairs. The finding that affinity for the UU:GA mismatch is flanking sequence dependent emphasizes the importance of motif context and potentially increases the number of small non-canonical features within RNA that can be specifically targeted by small molecules.",

    "abstract": "Traditionally molecular assembly pathways for viruses have been inferred from high resolution structures of stable intermediates purified in vitro, and from low resolution images of cell sections as well as from genetic approaches including conditionally lethal mutants. Here, we directly visualise a previously unsuspected  single shelled icosahedral intermediate for a mammalian orthoreovirus, in addition to the expected virions, in cryo-preserved infected cells by cryo-electron tomography of cellular lamellae1,2. Particle classification and averaging yielded structures at resolutions as high as 5.6 [A], sufficient to identify secondary structural elements and place known molecular structures, allowing us to produce an atomic model of the intermediate, comprising 120 copies of protein {lambda}1 and 120 copies of {sigma}2. This {lambda}1 shell is in a  collapsed form compared to the mature virions, with the molecules pushed inwards at the icosahedral 5-folds by ~100 [A]. This grossly indented shell, although produced by a mammalian reovirus, is reminiscent of the first assembly intermediate of prokaryotic dsRNA viruses belonging to a different virus family3, adding weight to the supposition that these diverse viruses share a common ancestor, and suggesting mechanisms for the assembly of viruses of the Reoviridae. Such methodology holds enormous promise for the dissection of the replication cycle of many viruses.",

We define Phox2a anterolateral system neuron birth order, migration and differentiation, and uncover an essential role for Phox2a in the development of relay of nociceptive signals from the spinal cord to the brain. Finally, we also demonstrate that the molecular identity of Phox2a neurons is conserved in the human foetal spinal cord.

    "abstract": "Cell death events continuously challenge epithelial barrier function, yet are crucial to eliminate old or critically damaged cells. How such apoptotic events are spatio-temporally organized to maintain epithelial homeostasis remains unclear. We observe waves of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) and AKT serine/threonine kinase (Akt) activity pulses that originate from apoptotic cells and propagate radially to healthy surrounding cells. This requires Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) signaling. At the single-cell level, ERK/Akt waves act as spatial survival signals that locally protect cells in the vicinity of the epithelial injury from apoptosis for a period of 3-4h. At the cell population level, ERK/Akt waves maintain epithelial homeostasis (EH) in response to mild or intense environmental insults. Disruption of this spatial signaling system results in the inability of a model epithelial tissue to ensure barrier function in response to environmental insults.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerotic vascular disease is the leading cause of death world-wide with few novel therapies available in spite of the ongoing health burden. Oxidative stress is a well-established driver of atherosclerotic progression; however the clinical translation of redox-based therapies is lacking. One of the challenges facing redox-based therapies is their targeted delivery to cellular domains of redox dysregulation. In the current study we sought to develop NPs encapsulating redox-based interventions that exploit passive means of targeting to selectively accumulate in atherosclerotic plaque with the aim of enhancing the intra-plaque bioavailability of interventions. Herein we present two types of nanoparticles (NPs): (i) We have employed flash nanoprecipitation to synthesize polymeric NPs encapsulating the hydrophobic Nrf2 activator drug, CDDO-Methyl, (ii) we have generated LDL-like NPs encapsulating the anti-inflammatory compound, oleic acid (OA). Nrf2-activators are a promising class of redox-active drug molecules whereby activation of Nrf2 results in the expression of several antioxidant and cyto-protective enzymes. Moreover, local activation of Nrf2 within the atherosclerotic plaque can be athero-protective. In this study we characterize the physiochemical properties of these NPs as well as confirm in vitro association of NPs with murine macrophages. In vitro drug release of CDDO-Me from polymeric NPs was determined by Nrf2-ARE-driven GFP fluorescence. In vivo localization was assessed through immunofluorescence of histological sections as well as whole-tissue light sheet fluorescence microscopy. We show that CDDO-Me-NPs and LDL-OA-NPs selectively accumulate in atherosclerotic plaque of two widely-used murine models of atherosclerosis: ApoE-/- and LDLr-/- mice. Overall, these studies underline that targeting of atherosclerotic plaque is an effective means to enhance delivery of redox-based interventions. Future work will assess the therapeutic efficacy of intra-plaque Nrf2 activation or anti-inflammatory actions with CDDO-Me-NPs or LDL-OA-NPs, respectively.",

Intriguingly, we did not observe any co-diffusion of fluorescently-labelled nanobodies with the GFP-labelled proteins. Our results suggest significant binding of the nanobodies to a non-emissive, oligomerized form of the fluorescent proteins, promoting disassembly into more monomeric forms after binding. Our findings show that great care must be taken when using nanobodies for studying dynamic and quantitative protein organisation.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic fusions involving tyrosine kinases are common drivers of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There are at least 15 different variants of the EML4-ALK fusion, all of which have a similar portion of ALK that includes the kinase domain, but different portions of EML4. Targeted treatment with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has proven effective but patient outcomes are variable. Here, we focus on one common variant, EML4-ALK V3, which drives an aggressive form of the disease. EML4-ALK V3 protein forms cytoplasmic liquid droplets that contain the signalling proteins GRB2 and SOS1. The TKIs ceritinib and lorlatinib dissolve these droplets and the EML4-ALK V3 protein re-localises to microtubules, an effect recapitulated by an inactivating mutation in the ALK catalytic site. Mutations that promote a constitutively active ALK stabilise the liquid droplets even in the presence of TKIs, indicating that droplets do not depend on kinase activity per se. Uniquely, the TKI alectinib promotes droplet formation of both the wild-type and catalytically inactive EML4-ALK V3 mutant, but not in a mutant that disrupts a hallmark of the kinase activity, the Lys-Glu salt-bridge. We propose that EML4-ALK V3 liquid droplet formation occurs through transient dimerization of the ALK kinase domain in its active conformation in the context of stable EML4-ALK trimers. Our results provide insights into the relationship between ALK activity, conformational state and the sub-cellular localisation of EML4-ALK V3 protein, and reveal the different effects of structurally divergent ALK TKIs on these properties.",

Such impairments are associated with alterations in brain structure and function, especially in the hippocampus, which changes to experience throughout life. It is well-known that regular exercise can maintain hippocampus volume. The hippocampus is critical for cognitive flexibility involved with extinction and reinstatement of conditioned fear. Therefore, we asked whether voluntary chronic exercise in middle-aged mice can improve extinction and/or reinstatement of conditioned fear compared to standard housing. Eight-month-old male and female C57Bl/6J mice had access to a running wheel or remained in standard housing until 11 months of age. Alongside control standard-housed young adult (3-month-old) mice, they received tone-footshock pairings, which were subsequently extinguished with tone-alone presentations the next day. Half of the mice then received a reminder treatment in the form of a single footshock. Both male and female 11-month-old mice housed in standard conditions exhibited impaired reinstatement compared to young adult mice. However, for males that had access to a running wheel from 8 months of age, the reminder treatment rescued reinstatement ability. This was not observed in females. Additionally, exercise during middle age in both sexes increased expression of Bdnf mRNA in the hippocampus, specifically exon 4 mRNA. These results show that, at least for males, physical exercise is beneficial for reducing age-related decline in cognitive abilities. Despite not rescuing their impaired reinstatement, exercise also increased Bdnf gene expression in the female hippocampus, which could potentially benefit other forms of hippocampal-dependent cognition.",
