    "abstract": "Atr is a serine/threonine kinase, known to sense single-stranded DNA breaks and activate the DNA damage checkpoint by phosphorylating Chek1, which inhibits Cdc25, causing cell cycle arrest. This pathway has not been implicated in neuroregeneration. We show that in Drosophila sensory neurons, removing Atr or Chek1, or overexpressing Cdc25 promotes regeneration, whereas Atr or Chek1 overexpression, or Cdc25 knockdown impedes regeneration. Inhibiting the Atr-associated checkpoint complex in neurons promotes regeneration and improves synapse/behavioral recovery after CNS injury. Independent of DNA damage, Atr responds to the mechanical stimulus elicited during regeneration, via the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo and its downstream NO signaling. Sensory neuron-specific knockout of Atr in adult mice, or pharmacological inhibition of Atr-Chek1 in mammalian neurons in vitro and in flies in vivo enhance regeneration. Our findings reveal the Piezo-Atr-Chek1-Cdc25 axis as an evolutionarily conserved inhibitory mechanism for regeneration, and identify potential therapeutic targets for treating nervous system trauma.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the functions of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs2/3) in the inferior colliculus (IC)--a midbrain structure that is a major integration region of the central auditory system. We investigated how these receptors modulate sound-evoked and spontaneous firing in the mouse IC in vivo. We first performed immunostaining and tested hearing thresholds to validate VGAT-ChR2 transgenic mice on a mixed CBA/CaJ x C57BL/6J genetic background. Transgenic animals allowed for optogenetic cell type identification. Extracellular single neuron recordings were obtained before and after pharmacological mGluR2/3 activation. We observed increased sound-evoked firing--as assessed by the rate-level functions--in a subset of both GABAergic and non-GABAergic IC neurons following mGluR2/3 pharmacological activation. These neurons also displayed elevated spontaneous excitability and were distributed throughout the IC area tested, suggesting a widespread mGluR2/3 distribution in the mouse IC.",

    "abstract": "Gambling disorder is associated with deficits in classical feedback-based learning tasks, but the computational mechanisms underlying such learning impairments are still poorly understood. Here, we examined this question using a combination of computational modeling and functional resonance imaging (fMRI) in gambling disorder participants (n=23) and matched controls (n=19). Participants performed a simple reinforcement learning task with two pairs of stimuli (80% vs. 20% reinforcement rates per pair). As predicted, gamblers made significantly fewer selections of the optimal stimulus, while overall response times (RTs) were not significantly different between groups. We then used comprehensive modeling using reinforcement learning drift diffusion models (RLDDMs) in combination with hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation to shed light on the computational underpinnings of this performance impairment. In both groups, an RLDDM in which both non-decision time and response threshold (boundary separation) changed over the course of the experiment accounted for the data best. The model showed good parameter recovery, and posterior predictive checks revealed that in both groups, the model reproduced the evolution of both accuracy and RTs over time. Examination of the group-wise posterior distributions revealed that the learning impairment in gamblers was attributable to both reduced learning rates and a more rapid reduction in boundary separation over time, compared to controls. Furthermore, gamblers also showed substantially shorter non-decision times. Model-based imaging analyses then revealed that value representations in gamblers in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex were attenuated compared to controls, and these effects were partly associated with model-based learning rates. Exploratory analyses revealed that a more anterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex cluster showed attenuations in value representations in proportion to gambling disorder severity in gamblers. Taken together, our findings reveal computational mechanisms underlying reinforcement learning impairments in gambling disorder, and confirm the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and as a critical neural hub in this disorder.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic transcription factors have great promise as tools to explore biological processes. By allowing precise alterations in gene expression, they can help elucidate relationships between gene expression and plant morphology or metabolism. However, the years-long timescales, high cost, and technical skill associated with plant transformation have dramatically slowed their use. In this work, we developed a new platform technology called VipariNama (ViN) in which RNA vectors are used to rapidly deploy synthetic transcription factors and reprogram gene expression in planta. We demonstrate how ViN vectors can direct activation or repression of multiple genes, systemically and persistently over several weeks, and in multiple plant species. We also show how this transcriptional reprogramming can create predictable changes to metabolic and morphological phenotypes in the model plants Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis thaliana in a matter of weeks. Finally, we show how a model of gibberellin signaling can guide ViN vector-based reprogramming to rapidly engineer plant size in both model species as well as the crop Solanum lycopersicum (tomato). In summary, using VipariNama accelerates the timeline for generating phenotypes from over a year to just a few weeks, providing an attractive alternative to transgenesis for synthetic transcription factor-enabled hypothesis testing and crop engineering.",

    "abstract": "Rapid divergence in genital structures among nascent species has been posited to be an early-evolving cause of reproductive isolation, although evidence supporting this idea as a widespread phenomenon remains mixed. Using a collection of interspecific introgression lines between two Drosophila species that diverged [~]240,000 years ago, we tested the hypothesis that even modest divergence in genital morphology can result in substantial fitness losses. We studied the reproductive consequences of variation in the male epandrial posterior lobes between Drosophila mauritiana and D. sechellia and found that divergence in posterior lobe morphology has significant fitness costs on several pre-fertilization and post-copulatory reproductive measures. Males with divergent posterior lobe morphology also significantly reduced the life span of their mates. Interestingly, one of the consequences of genital divergence was decreased oviposition and fertilization, which suggests that a sensory bias for posterior lobe morphology could exist in females, and thus posterior lobe morphology may be the target of cryptic female choice in these species. Our results provide evidence that divergence in genitalia can in fact give rise to substantial reproductive isolation early during species divergence, and they also reveal novel reproductive functions of the external male genitalia in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveScalp high frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a promising biomarker of epileptogenicity in infantile spasms (IS) and many other epilepsy syndromes, but prior studies have relied on visual analysis of short segments of data due to the prevalence of artifacts in EEG. Therefore, we set out to develop a fully automated method of HFO detection that can be applied to large datasets, and we sought to robustly characterize the rate and spatial distribution of HFOs in IS.\n\nMethodsWe prospectively collected long-term scalp EEG data from 13 subjects with IS and 18 healthy controls. For patients with IS, recording began prior to diagnosis and continued through initiation of treatment with adenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The median analyzable EEG duration was 18.2 hours for controls and 83.9 hours for IS subjects ([~]1300 hours total). Ripples (80-250 Hz) were detected in all EEG data using an automated algorithm.\n\nResultsHFO rates were substantially higher in patients with IS compared to controls. In IS patients, HFO rates were higher during sleep compared to wakefulness (median 5.5/min and 2.9/min, respectively; p =0.002); controls did not exhibit a difference in HFO rate between sleep and wakefulness (median 0.98/min and 0.82/min, respectively). Spatially, the difference between IS patients and controls was most salient in the central/posterior parasaggital region, where very few HFOs were detected in controls. In IS subjects, ACTH therapy significantly decreased the rate of HFOs.\n\nDiscussionHere we show for the first time that a fully automated algorithm can be used to detect HFOs in long-term scalp EEG, and the results are accurate enough to clearly discriminate healthy subjects from those with IS. We also provide a detailed characterization of the spatial distribution and rates of HFOs associated with infantile spasms, which may have relevance for diagnosis and assessment of treatment response.",

    "abstract": "Varenicline is one of the top medications used for smoking cessation and is often prescribed before termination of nicotine use. The effect of this combined nicotine and varenicline use on the reward system and motivation for primary reinforcement is underexplored. The goal of this study was to assess the effects of nicotine and varenicline on the consumption of sucrose. In Experiment 1, we first assessed the responding for sucrose after pretreatment with nicotine (0, 0.1, or 0.4 mg/kg) and varenicline (0.0, 0.1, 1.0 mg/kg) using a behavioral economics approach. The responding for sucrose was then assessed using a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement after pretreatment with all possible combinations of nicotine and varenicline doses. In Experiment 2, rats were assessed for the consumption of sucrose in home cages after pretreatment with nicotine and varenicline. We found that a) nicotine decreased economic demand for sucrose, b) varenicline rescued nicotine-induced reduction in economic demand for sucrose, and c) history of varenicline treatment predicted responding for sucrose on a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement where rats with a history of varenicline treatment responded significantly lower for sucrose across nicotine doses than rats that have not being exposed to varenicline. The results of Experiment 2 largely confirmed that nicotine decreases motivation for sucrose using a passive consumption protocol and that varenicline rescues this effect. Overall, these findings suggest that varenicline interacts with the effects of nicotine by restoring nicotine-induced reduction in motivation for appetitive rewards.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Tomatoes come in a multitude of shapes and flavors despite a narrow genetic pool. Here, we leveraged whole-genome resequencing data available for 602 cultivated and wild accessions to determine the contribution of transposable elements (TEs) to tomato diversity. We identified 6,906 TE insertions polymorphisms (TIPs), which result from the mobilization of 337 distinct TE families. Most TIPs are low frequency variants and disproportionately located within or adjacent to genes involved in environmental response. In addition, we show that genic TE insertions tend to have strong transcriptional effects and can notably lead to the generation of multiple transcript isoforms. We also uncovered through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) ~180 TIPs associated with extreme variations in major agronomic traits or secondary metabolites. Importantly, these TIPs tend to affect loci that are distinct from those tagged by SNPs. Collectively, our findings suggest a unique and important role for TE mobilization in tomato diversification, with important implications for future breeding.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the function and dysfunction of the brain remains one of the key challenges of our time. However, an overwhelming majority of brain research is carried out in the Global North, by a minority of well-funded and intimately interconnected labs. In contrast, with an estimated one neuroscientist per million people in Africa, news about neuroscience research from the Global South remains sparse. Clearly, devising new policies to boost Africa\u2019s neuroscience landscape is imperative. However, the policy must be based on accurate data, which is largely lacking. Such data must reflect the extreme heterogeneity of research outputs across the continent\u2019s 54 countries distributed over an area larger than USA, Europe and China combined. Here, we analysed all of Africa\u2019s Neuroscience output over the past 21 years. Uniquely, we individually verified in each of 12,326 publications that the work was indeed performed in Africa and led by African-based researchers. This step is critical: previous estimates grossly inflated figures, because many of Africa\u2019s high-visibility publications are in fact the result of internationally led collaborations, with most work done outside of Africa. The remaining number of African-led Neuroscience publications was 5,219, on average only ~5 per country and year. From here, we extracted metrics such as the journal and citations, as well as detailed information on funding, international collaborations and the techniques and model systems used. We link these metrics to demographic data and indicators of mobility and economy. For reference, we also extracted the same metrics from 220 randomly selected publications each from the UK, USA, Australia, Japan and Brazil. Our unique dataset allows us to gain accurate and in-depth information on the current state of African Neuroscience research, and to put it into a global context. This in turn allows us to make actionable recommendations on how African research might best be supported in the future.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "HMG-CoA reductase (Pseudomonas mevalonii) utilizes mevalonate, coenzyme A (CoA) and the cofactor NAD in a complex mechanism involving two hydride transfers with cofactor exchange, accompanied by large conformational changes by a 50 residue subdomain, to generate HMG-CoA. Details about this mechanism such as the conformational changes that allow intermediate formation, cofactor exchange and product release remain unknown. The formation of the proposed intermediates has also not been observed in structural studies with natural substrates. Having been shown to be an essential enzyme for the survival of gram-positive antibiotic resistant pathogenic bacteria, studying its mechanism in detail will be beneficial in developing novel antibacterials. The enzyme has been shown to be catalytically active inside the crystal with dithio-HMG-CoA and NADH but curiously is found to be inactive in the reverse direction in the structure bound to mevalonate, CoA and NAD.\n\nTo understand the factors limiting activity in the HMGR crystal with mevalonate, CoA and NAD, we studied the effect of crystallization components and pH on enzymatic activity. We observed a strong inhibition in the crystallization buffer and an increase in activity with increasing pH. We attribute this inhibitive effect to the presence of ammonium ions present in the crystal since inhibition is also observed with several other ammonium salt buffers. Additionally, the lack of inhibition was observed in the absence of ammonium. The effect of each ligand (mevalonate, CoA and NAD) on the rate of the enzymatic reaction in the crystallization environment was further investigated by measuring their Km in the crystallization buffer. The Km measurements indicate that the hydride transfer step between NAD and mevalonate is inhibited in the crystallization environment. To test this further, we solved a crystal structure of pmHMGR bound to the post-hydride transfer intermediate (mevaldehyde) and cofactor Coenzyme A. The resulting turnover with the formation of a thiohemiacetal indicated that the crystallization environment inhibited the oxidative acylation of mevalonate and the reaction intermediate mevaldyl-CoA.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveRadiotherapy, combined with surgical resection and chemotherapy, remains a first-line treatment for infiltrative gliomas. However, these tumor are not surgically curable, and often recur, even within the prior radiation field, and may demonstrate a more aggressive phenotype. We recently demonstrated that the radiated brain tumor microenvironment promotes tumor aggressiveness in an orthotopic patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of glioblastoma (Mayo GBM 143). Importantly, high grade gliomas display diverse molecular phenotypes, and whether this genetic variability leads to divergent behaviour in the radiated tumor microenvironment is unknown. Herein, we characterize the effects of the irradiated brain microenvinroment on nine additional unique GBM cell lines to better understand the nuances of how tumor molecular phenotypes influence cellular dynamics.\n\nMethodsFemale athymic nude mice were randomly divided into cranial radiation (15 Gy) and non-radiated groups. Mice then underwent intracranial implantation with one of the selected PDX GBM cell lines (GBM 6, 10, 12, 39, 46, 76, 123, 164, 196; total n=8-15, per group, per line). GBM 6 cells were additionally implanted 6 months after completion of fractionated radiation (4Gy x 10 fractions or 2Gy x 30 fractions) vs sham radiation. Kaplan-Meyer (K-M) and log-rank tests were performed to compare the survival between irradiated and non-irradiated groups.\n\nResultOf nine previously untested human GBM lines, we found that five demonstrated shorter survival in the pre-radiated brain (GBM 6, 46, 76, 164, 196); similar to previous observations with GBM 143. GBM 6 was also evaluated 6 months after fractionated radiation yielding similar results. However, two lines yielded prolonged survival in the pre-radiated brain (GBM 10, 12); GBM12 and 10 demonstrated the fastest baseline growth in the non-radiated brain; GBM 39, 123 whose rate of growth was not impacted by the radiated brain, demonstrated a an intermediate baseline growth rate between that of those positively and negatively impacted by the radiated brain microenvironment. No other clinical or molecular phenotype was found to consistently correlate with response to the radiated microenvironment.\n\nConclusionAmong a total of 10 total human GBM lines evaluated to date, 60% induce faster mortality in a radiated microenvironment, and 20% induce slower mortality. These results highlight the likely critical impact of the irradiated microenvironment on tumor behaviour, yet illustrate that different tumors may exhibit opposing responses. Although further evaluation will be needed to understand mechanisms of divergent behavior, our data suggest the increased rate of growth in the radiated microenvironment may not apply to the fastest-growing tumor lines, which could instead demonstrate a paradoxical response.",

    "abstract": "The processes that give rise to species richness gradients are not well understood, but may be linked to resource-based limits on the number of species a region can support. Ecological limits placed on regional species richness would also limit population sizes, suggesting that these processes could also generate genetic diversity gradients. If true, we might better understand how broad-scale biodiversity patterns are formed by identifying the common causes of genetic diversity and species richness. We develop a hypothetical framework based on the consequences of regional variation in ecological limits to simultaneously explain spatial patterns of species richness and neutral genetic diversity. Repurposing raw genotypic data spanning 38 mammal species sampled across 801 sites in North America, we show that estimates of genome-wide genetic diversity and species richness share spatial structure. Notably, species richness hotspots tend to harbor lower levels of within-species genetic variation. A structural equation model encompassing eco-evolutionary processes related to resource availability, habitat heterogeneity, and human disturbance explained 78% of variation in genetic diversity and 74% of the variation in species richness. These results suggest we can infer broad-scale patterns of species and genetic diversity using two simple environmental measures of resource availability and ecological opportunity.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary speciation provides a unique opportunity to directly observe the traits and environmental responses of a new species. Cardamine insueta is an allotriploid species that appeared within the past 150 years in a Swiss village, Urnerboden. In contrast to its two progenitor species, C. amara and C. rivularis that live in wet and open habitats, respectively, C. insueta is found in-between their habitats with temporal water level fluctuation. This triploid species propagates clonally and serves as a triploid bridge to form higher ploidy species. Although niche separation is observed in field studies, the mechanisms underlying the environmental robustness of C. insueta are not clear. To characterize responses to a fluctuating environment, we performed a time-course analysis of homeolog gene expression in C. insueta in response to submergence treatment. For this purpose, the two parental (C. amara and C. rivularis) genome sequences were assembled with a reference-guided approach, and homeolog-specific gene expression was quantified by using HomeoRoq software. We found that C. insueta and C. rivularis initiated vegetative propagation by forming ectopic meristems on leaves, while C. amara did not. We examined homeolog-specific gene expression of three species at nine time points during the treatment. The genome-wide expression ratio of homeolog pairs was 2:1 over the time-course, consistent with the ploidy number. By searching the genes with high coefficient of variation of expression over time-course transcriptome data, we found many known key transcriptional factors related to meristem development and formation upregulated in both C. rivularis and rivularis-homeolog of C. insueta, but not in C. amara. Moreover, some amara-homeologs of these genes were also upregulated in the triploid, suggesting trans-regulation. In turn, Gene Ontology analysis suggested that the expression pattern of submergence tolerant genes in the triploid was inherited from C. amara. These results suggest that the triploid C. insueta combined advantageous patterns of parental transcriptomes to contribute to its establishment in a new niche along a water-usage gradient.",

    "abstract": "MHC-I associated peptides (MAPs) play a central role in the elimination of virus-infected and neoplastic cells by CD8 T cells. However, accurately predicting the MAP repertoire remains difficult, because only a fraction of the transcriptome generates MAPs. In this study, we investigated whether codon arrangement (usage and placement) regulates MAP biogenesis. We developed an artificial neural network called Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor (CAMAP), predicting MAP presentation solely from mRNA sequences flanking the MAP-coding codons (MCCs), while excluding the MCC per se. CAMAP predictions were significantly more accurate when using original codon sequences than shuffled codon sequences which reflect amino acid usage. Furthermore, predictions were independent of mRNA expression and MAP binding affinity to MHC-I molecules and applied to several cell types and species. Combining MAP ligand scores, transcript expression level and CAMAP scores was particularly useful to increaser MAP prediction accuracy. Using an in vitro assay, we showed that varying the synonymous codons in the regions flanking the MCCs (without changing the amino acid sequence) resulted in significant modulation of MAP presentation at the cell surface. Taken together, our results demonstrate the role of codon arrangement in the regulation of MAP presentation and support integration of both translational and post-translational events in predictive algorithms to ameliorate modeling of the immunopeptidome.\n\nAuthor summaryMHC-I associated peptides (MAPs) are small fragments of intracellular proteins presented at the surface of cells and used by the immune system to detect and eliminate cancerous or virus-infected cells. While it is theoretically possible to predict which portions of the intracellular proteins will be naturally processed by the cells to ultimately reach the surface, current methodologies have prohibitively high false discovery rates. Here we introduce an artificial neural network called Codon Arrangement MAP Predictor (CAMAP) which integrates information from mRNA-to-protein translation to other factors regulating MAP biogenesis (e.g. MAP ligand score and transcript expression levels) to improve MAP prediction accuracy. While most MAP predictive approaches focus on MAP sequences per se, CAMAPs novelty is to analyze the MAP-flanking mRNA sequences, thereby providing completely independent information for MAP prediction. We show on several datasets that the integration of CAMAP scores with other known factors involved in MAP presentation (i.e. MAP ligand score and mRNA expression) significantly improves MAP prediction accuracy, and further validate CAMAP learned features using an in-vitro assay. These findings may have major implications for the design of vaccines against cancers and viruses, and in times of pandemics could accelerate the identification of relevant MAPs of viral origins.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin is the tightly packaged structure of DNA and protein within the nucleus of a cell. The arrangement of different protein complexes along the DNA modulates and is modulated by gene expression. Measuring the binding locations and level of occupancy of different transcription factors (TFs) and nucleosomes is therefore crucial to understanding gene regulation. Antibody-based methods for assaying chromatin occupancy are capable of identifying the binding sites of specific DNA binding factors, but only one factor at a time. On the other hand, epigenomic accessibility data like ATAC-seq, DNase-seq, and MNase-seq provide insight into the chromatin landscape of all factors bound along the genome, but with minimal insight into the identities of those factors. Here, we present RoboCOP, a multivariate state space model that integrates chromatin information from epigenomic accessibility data with nucleotide sequence to compute genome-wide probabilistic scores of nucleosome and TF occupancy, for hundreds of different factors at once. We apply RoboCOP to MNase-seq data to elucidate the protein-binding landscape of nucleosomes and 150 TFs across the yeast genome. Using available protein-binding datasets from the literature, we show that our model predicts the binding of these factors genome-wide more accurately than existing methods.",

UBR5, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, is mutated and/or overexpressed in human lung cancer cells suggesting its pathological role in cancer.\n\nMethodsWe determined expression of UBR5 protein in multiple lung cancer cell lines and human patient samples. Using immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry we determined the UBR5 interacting proteins. The impact of loss of UBR5 for lung adenocarcinoma cell lines was analyzed using cell viability, clonogenic assays and in vivo xenograft models in nude mice. Additional Western blot analysis was performed to assess the loss of UBR5 on downstream signaling. Statistical analysis was done by one-way ANOVA for in vitro studies and Wilcoxon paired t-test for tumor volumes in vivo.\n\nResultsWe show variability of UBR5 expression levels in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and in primary human patient samples. To gain better insight into the role that UBR5 may play in lung cancer progression we performed unbiased interactome analyses for UBR5. Data indicate that UBR5 has a wide range of interacting protein partners that are known to be involved in critical cellular processes such as DNA damage, proliferation and cell cycle regulation. We have demonstrated that shRNA-mediated loss of UBR5 decreases cell viability and clonogenic potential of lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. In addition, we found decreased levels of activated AKT signaling after the loss of UBR5 in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines using multiple means of UBR5 knockdown/knockout. Furthermore, we demonstrated that loss of UBR5 in lung adenocarcinoma cells results in significant reduction of tumor volume in nude mice.\n\nConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that deregulation of the N-end rule ubiquitination pathway plays a crucial role in the etiology of some human cancers, and blocking this pathway via UBR5-specific inhibitors, may represent a unique therapeutic target for human cancers.",

    "abstract": "Despite continued efforts into improving biosecurity protocol, Campylobacter continues to be detected in the majority of commercial chicken flocks across Europe. Using an extensive data set of Campylobacter prevalence within a chicken breeder flock for over a year, multiple Bayesian models are presented to explore the dynamics of the spread of Campylobacter in response to seasonal variation, species-specificity, bird health and total infection prevalence. It was found that birds within the flock varied greatly in their response to bacterial challenge, and that this phenomena had a large impact in the overall prevalence of different species of Campylobacter. Campylobacter jejuni appeared more frequently in the summer, while Campylobacter coli persisted for a longer duration, amplified by the most susceptible birds in the flock. Our study suggests that strains of Campylobacter that appear most frequently likely possess no demographic advantage, but are instead amplified due to the health of the birds that ingest it.",

    "abstract": "In the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb, local dopaminergic interneurons play a key role in regulating the flow of sensory information from nose to cortex. These dual dopamine- and GABA-releasing cells are capable of marked experience-dependent changes in the expression of neurotransmitter-synthesising enzymes, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). However, such plasticity has most commonly been studied in cell populations identified by their expression of the enzyme being studied, and after long periods of sensory deprivation. Here, instead, we used brief 1- or 3-day manipulations of olfactory experience in juvenile mice, coupled with a conditional genetic approach that labelled neurons contingent upon their expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT-tdTomato). This enabled us to evaluate the potential for rapid changes in neurotransmitter-synthesising enzyme expression in an independently identified neuronal population. Our labelling strategy showed good specificity for olfactory bulb dopaminergic neurons, whilst revealing a minority sub-population of non-dopaminergic DAT-tdTomato cells that expressed the calcium-binding protein calretinin. Crucially, the proportions of these neuronal subtypes were not affected by brief alterations in sensory experience. Short-term olfactory manipulations also produced no significant changes in immunofluorescence or whole-bulb mRNA for the GABA-synthesising enzyme GAD67/Gad1. However, in bulbar DAT-tdTomato neurons brief sensory deprivation was accompanied by a transient, small drop in immunofluorescence for the dopamine-synthesising enzyme dopa decarboxylase (DDC), and a sustained decrease for TH. Deprivation also produced a sustained decrease in whole-bulb Th mRNA. Careful characterisation of an independently identified, genetically labelled neuronal population therefore enabled us to uncover rapid experience-dependent changes in dopamine-synthesising enzyme expression.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory infections, such as the novel coronavirus (SARS-COV-2) and other lung injuries, damage the pulmonary epithelium. In the most severe cases this leads to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Due to respiratory failure associated with ARDS, the clinical intervention is the use of mechanical ventilation. Despite the benefits of mechanical ventilators, prolonged or misuse of these ventilators may lead to ventilation-associated/ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI). Damage caused to epithelial cells within the alveoli can lead to various types of complications and increased mortality rates. A key component of the immune response is recruitment of macrophages, immune cells that differentiate into phenotypes with unique pro- and/or anti-inflammatory roles based on the surrounding environment. An imbalance in pro- and anti-inflammatory responses can have deleterious effects on the individuals health. To gain a greater understanding of the mechanisms of the immune response to VILI and post-ventilation outcomes, we develop a mathematical model of interactions between the immune system and site of damage while accounting for macrophage polarization. Through Latin hypercube sampling we generate a virtual cohort of patients with biologically feasible dynamics. We use a variety of methods to analyze the results, including a random forest decision tree algorithm and parameter sensitivity with eFAST.

    "abstract": "Many lysosome functions are determined by a lumenal pH of ~5.0, including the activity of resident acid-activated hydrolases. Lysosome pH (pHlys) is increased in neurodegenerative disorders and predicted to be decreased in cancers, making it a potential target for therapeutics to limit the progression of these diseases. Accurately measuring pHlys, however, is limited by currently used dyes that accumulate in multiple intracellular compartments and cannot be propagated in clonal cells for longitudinal studies or in vivo determinations. To resolve this limitation, we developed a genetically encoded ratiometric pHlys biosensor, pHLARE (pH Lysosomal Activity REporter), which localizes predominantly in lysosomes, has a dynamic range of pH 4.0 to 6.5, and can be stably expressed in cells. Using pHLARE we show decreased pHlys with inhibiting activity of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), in breast and pancreatic cancer cells compared with tissue-matched untransformed cells, and with the activated oncogene H-RasV12. pHLARE is a new tool to accurately measure pHlys, for improved understanding of lysosome dynamics that could be a promising therapeutic target.\n\nSummary StatementMost lysosome functions require a low lumenal pH, which is dysregulated in many human diseases.

    "abstract": "Conservation of exploited fish populations is a priority for environmental managers. Spatio-temporal knowledge on reproductive sites is mandatory for species and habitat conservation but is often difficult to assess, particularly over vast geographic areas. Regular and long-term standardized surveys are necessary to identify reproductive sites, assess population trends and their distribution. Here we emphasize the utility of Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) for the survey and management of a depleted vulnerable Mediterranean fish species, the brown meagre, Sciaena umbra. Acoustic surveys of reproductive calls were conducted combining 1) spatial data from standardized surveys within three MPAs and from 49 unprotected sites throughout the Northwestern Mediterranean basin, as well as 2) temporal data from a two-year-long survey at a presumed spawning location. The MPA surveys, which rapidly scanned ~30-50 km of the rocky coastlines per MPA, unveiled maps of distribution and reproductive activity of the brown meagre, including potential spawning sites. They were also effective in emphasizing effects linked to management actions: Full-protection zones had a higher number of vocalizations (70% of the listening sites) compared to less protected zones (30% of the sites) or sites outside MPAs (45% of the sites). This was also reflected in the number of singers that was generally low (< 3 individuals) in less protected zones and outside MPAs, implying lower fish densities. Highest calling aggregations were observed in potential spawning areas that represented only 0.04% of all listening sites, and were almost all in older, fully protected MPAs, which thus play a key role for fish stock recovery. The two-year survey revealed a 5-month reproductive season (from May to October) with a strong positive correlation between calling activity and temperature. Overall this study confirms the role of PAM as an efficient, replicable and standardized non-invasive method for population management that can identify functional sites and key protection zones, provide valuable information on reproduction, spatial and temporal occurrence, but also on population trends and climate-driven changes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMonitoring of threatened species and their key habitats is critical for environmental managers.\nC_LIO_LIManagement requires methods to assess population trends at large spatial and temporal scales.\nC_LIO_LIPassive acoustics (PA) is efficient in mapping and monitoring vulnerable fish species.\nC_LIO_LIDistribution, reproductive sites and population dynamics can be assessed over vast geographical areas.\nC_LIO_LIWe show the utility of PA to identify key conservation zones and assess effects of management actions.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The non-psychoactive cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), is FDA-approved for treatment of two drug-resistant epileptic disorders, and is seeing increased use among the general public, yet the mechanisms that underlie its therapeutic effects and side-effect profiles remain unclear. Here, we report a systems-level analysis of CBD action in human cell lines using temporal multi-omic profiling. FRET-based biosensor screening revealed that CBD treatment resulted in a sharp rise in cytosolic calcium, and activation of AMPK and ERK kinases in human keratinocyte and neuroblastoma cell lines. CBD treatment led to alterations in the abundance of metabolites, mRNA transcripts, and proteins consistent with activation of cholesterol biosynthesis, transport and storage. We found that CBD rapidly incorporated into cellular membranes and altered cholesterol chemical activity, suggesting direct perturbation of cholesterol-dependent membrane properties. CBD treatment induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in multiple human cell lines, which was rescued by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, and potentiated by compounds that disrupt cholesterol trafficking and storage. Our data point to a pharmacological interaction of CBD with cholesterol homeostasis pathways, with potential implications in its therapeutic use.",

    "abstract": "Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) exhibit complex dynamics across a variety of behavioral contexts, often in ways that seem task-specific and even incompatible with results across different paradigms. Dopaminergic signaling during timing tasks has been a prime example. In behavioral timing, dopaminergic dynamics predict the initiation of self-timed movement via a seconds-long ramp up of activity prior to movement onset, similar to ramping seen in visuospatial reward approach and multi-step, goal-directed behaviors. By contrast, in perceptual timing, DANs exhibit more complex dynamics whose direction of modulation seems to be the opposite of that observed in behavioral timing. Mikhael et al. (2022) recently proposed a formal model in which dopaminergic dynamics encode reward expectation in the form of an \"ongoing\" reward-prediction error (RPE) that arises from resolving uncertainty of ones position in the value landscape (i.e., ones spatial-temporal distance to reward delivery/omission). Here, we show that application of this framework recapitulates and reconciles the seemingly contradictory dopaminergic dynamics observed in behavioral vs perceptual timing. These results suggest a common neural mechanism that broadly underlies timing behavior: trial-by-trial variation in the rate of the internal \"pacemaker,\" manifested in DAN signals that reflect stretching or compression of the derivative of the subjective value function relative to veridical time. In this view, faster pacemaking is associated with relatively high amplitude dopaminergic signaling, whereas slower pacemaking is associated with relatively low levels of dopaminergic signaling, consistent with findings from pharmacological and lesion studies.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research and numerous basic science advances, there have only marginal gains in improving glioblastoma multiforme survival. Therefore, new ideas and approaches for treating this aggressive disease are essential to drive progress forward. Conventional therapies, such as radiation and Temozolomide (TMZ), function to cause oxidative stress and DNA damage yielding a senescent-like state of replicative arrest in susceptible cells. However, increasing evidence demonstrates malignant cells can escape senescence leading to tumor recurrence. Ablation of non-replicating senescent tumor cells after radiation and chemotherapy may be an avenue to reduce the rates of tumor recurrence. Senolytic agents have been developed that selectively target senescent cells, but it remains unknown whether senolytics might be utilized against senescent-like glioma cells. We employed radiation or TMZ to induce a functionally senescent state in human glioblastoma cells. Viable cells that survive these treatments were then utilized to screen candidate senolytic drugs, to identify those selectively effective at ablating senescent-like cells over naive non-tumor and proliferative cells. Among 10 candidate senolytic drugs evaluated, only Bcl-XL inhibitors demonstrated reproducible senolytic activity in radiated or TMZ-treated glioma across the majority of GBM cell lines evaluated. Conversely, Bcl-2 inhibitors and other established senolytic drugs failed to show any consistent senolytic activity. In agreement with these data, Bcl-XL knockdown selectively reduced the viability of senescent-like GBM cells, whereas knockdown of Bcl-2 or Bcl-W yielded no senolytic effect. These findings demonstrate the potential to harness radiation-induced biology to ablate latent surviving cells and highlight Bcl-XL dependency as a potential vulnerability of surviving GBM cells after exposure to radiation or TMZ.",

    "abstract": "Plant physiological processes generally are regulated by phytohormones, including plant biochemical responses to herbivory. Here, we addressed whether a suite of maize (Zea mays mays) phytohormones, including some precursor and derivative metabolites, relevant to herbivory defence were mediated by the crops domestication, northward spread, and modern breeding. For this, we compared phytohormone and metabolite levels among four plant types representing the evolutionary and agronomic transitions from maizes wild ancestor, Balsas teosinte (Zea mays parviglumis), to Mexican and US maize landraces, and to highly-bred US maize cultivars, as affected by root herbivory by Western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera). Following ecological-evolutionary hypotheses, we expected to find changes in: (i) maize defence strategy, from reliance on induced to constitutive defences; (ii) levels of phytohormones relevant to herbivore resistance consistent with gradual weakening of defences, and; (iii) levels of a phytohormone relevant to herbivory tolerance because it positively affects plant growth. We found that with its domestication, maize seemed to have transitioned from reliance on induced defences in Balsas teosinte to reliance on constitutive defences in maize. Also, we found that while one subset of phytohormones relevant to herbivory was suppressed (13-oxylipins), another was enhanced (9-oxylipins) with domestication, and both subsets were variably affected by spread and breeding. Finally, an auxin phytohormone directly linked to growth (indole-3-acetic acid), increased significantly with domestication, and seemingly with spread and breeding. We concluded that rootworm defences in maize were mediated by domestication and ensuing processes, such as spread and breeding, and argued that agricultural intensification mediated maize defence evolution in parallel with modern breeding.",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation is expected to cause high FST at sites linked to a causal locus, however this pattern can also be driven by background or positive selection. Within-population nucleotide diversity could provide a means to differentiate these scenarios, as both background and positive selection deplete diversity, whereas some theoretical studies have shown that local adaptation increases it. However, it is unclear whether such theoretical predictions generalize to more complicated models. Here, we explore how local adaptation shapes genome-wide patterns in nucleotide diversity and FST, extending previous work to study the effect of variable degrees of polygenicity and genotypic redundancy in an adaptive trait, and different levels of population structure. We show that local adaptation produces two very different patterns depending on the relative strengths of migration and selection, either markedly decreasing or increasing within-population diversity at linked sites at equilibrium. When migration is low, regions of depleted diversity can extend large distances from the causal locus, with substantially more diversity eroded than expected with background selection. With higher migration, peaks occur over much smaller genomic distances but with much larger magnitude changes in diversity. In spatially extended clinal environments both patterns can be found within a single species, with increases in diversity at the center of the range and decreases towards the periphery. Our results demonstrate that there is no universal diagnostic signature of local adaptation based on nucleotide diversity, however, given that neither background nor positive selection inflate diversity, when peaks are found they strongly suggest local adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Callosal projections from primary somatosensory cortex (S1) are key for processing somatosensory inputs and integrating sensory-motor information. How the callosal innervation pattern in S1 is formed during early postnatal development is not clear. We found that the normal termination pattern of these callosal projections is disrupted in cortex specific NMDAR mutants. Rather than projecting selectively to the primary/secondary somatosensory cortex (S1/S2) border, axons were uniformly distributed throughout S1. In addition, the density of this projection increased over postnatal life until the mice died by P30. By combining genetic and antibody-mediated loss of function, we demonstrated that it is NR2B-containing NMDA receptors in target S1 that mediate this guidance phenotype, thus playing a central role in interhemispheric connectivity. Furthermore, we found that this function of NMDA receptors in callosal circuit formation is independent of ion channel function and instead depends on interactions with EPHRIN-B/EPHB. Thus, NMDAR cooperates with EPHRIN-B/EPHB in target S1 to control the formation callosal circuits by acting as an accessory axon guidance receptor modulating EPH-dependent repulsion.",

    "abstract": "Although cortical circuits are complex and interconnected with the rest of the brain, their macroscopic dynamics are often approximated by modeling the averaged activities of excitatory and inhibitory cortical neurons, without interactions with other brain circuits. To verify the validity of such mean-field models, we optogenetically stimulated populations of excitatory and parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons in awake mouse visual cortex, while recording population activity in cortex and in its thalamic correspondent, the lateral geniculate nucleus. The cortical responses to brief test pulses could not be explained by a mean-field model including only cortical excitatory and inhibitory populations. However, these responses could be predicted by extending the model to include thalamic interactions that cause net cortical suppression following activation of cortical excitatory neurons. We conclude that mean-field models can accurately summarize cortical dynamics, but only when the cortex is considered as part of a dynamic corticothalamic network.",

Variants outside of these regions may have a large impact on protein expression and/or structure and can lead to disease, but this effect can be challenging to predict. Consequently, these variants are poorly annotated using standard tools. We have developed a plugin to the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor, the UTRannotator, that annotates variants in 5untranslated regions (5UTR) that create or disrupt upstream open reading frames (uORFs). We investigate the utility of this tool using the ClinVar database, providing an annotation for 30.8% of all 5UTR (likely) pathogenic variants, and highlighting 31 variants of uncertain significance as candidates for further follow-up. We will continue to update the UTR annotator as we gain new knowledge on the impact of variants in UTRs.\n\nAvailability and implementationUTRannotator is freely available on Github: https://github.com/ImperialCardioGenetics/UTRannotator\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at bioRxiv.",

    "abstract": "Local landrace and breeding germplasm is a useful source of genetic diversity for regional and global crop improvement initiatives. Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) in West Africa has diversified across a mosaic of cultures and end-uses, and along steep precipitation and photoperiod gradients. To facilitate germplasm utilization, a West African sorghum association panel (WASAP) of 756 accessions from national breeding programs of Niger, Mali, Senegal, and Togo was assembled and characterized. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to generate 159,101 high-quality biallelic SNPs, with 43% in intergenic regions and 13% in genic regions. High genetic diversity was observed within the WASAP ({pi} = 0.00045), only slightly less than in a global diversity panel ({pi} = 0.00055). Linkage disequilibrium decayed to background level (r2 < 0.1) by ~50 kb in the WASAP. Genome-wide diversity was structured both by botanical type, and by populations within botanical type, with eight ancestral populations identified. Most populations were distributed across multiple countries, suggesting several potential common gene pools across the national programs. Genome-wide association studies of days to flowering and plant height revealed eight and three significant quantitative trait loci (QTL), respectively, with major height QTL at canonical height loci Dw3 and SbHT7.1. Colocalization of two of eight major flowering time QTL with flowering genes previously described in US germplasm (Ma6 and SbCN8) suggests that photoperiodic flowering in WA sorghum is conditioned by both known and novel genes. This genomic resource provides a foundation for genomics-enabled breeding of climate-resilient varieties in West Africa.",

Saliva has anti-haemostatic and anti-inflammatory activities that evolved to facilitate bloodfeeding, but also modulate the hosts immune responses.

Here, we characterised the profile of N-glycans from the salivary glycoproteins of Lutzomyia longipalpis, vector of visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas. In silico predictions suggest half of Lu. longipalpis salivary proteins may be N-glycosylated. SDS-PAGE coupled to LC-MS analysis of sand fly saliva, before and after enzymatic deglycosylation, revealed several candidate glycoproteins. To determine the diversity of N-glycan structures in sand fly saliva, enzymatically released sugars were fluorescently tagged and analysed by HPLC, combined with highly sensitive LC-MS/MS, MALDI-TOF-MS, and exoglycosidase treatments. We found that the N-glycan composition of Lu. longipalpis saliva mostly consists of oligomannose sugars, with Man5GlcNAc2 being the most abundant, and a few hybrid-type species. Interestingly, some glycans appear modified with a group of 144 Da, whose identity has yet to be confirmed. Our work presents the first detailed structural analysis of sand fly salivary glycans.",

    "abstract": "Differentiation of sex chromosomes is thought to have evolved with cessation of recombination and subsequent loss of genes from the degenerated partner (Y and W) of sex chromosomes, which in turn leads to imbalance of gene dosage between sexes. Based on work with traditional model species, theory suggests that unequal gene copy numbers lead to the evolution of mechanisms to counter this imbalance. Dosage compensation, or at least achieving dosage balance in expression of sex-linked genes between sexes, has largely been documented in lineages with male heterogamety (XX/XY sex determination), while ZZ/ZW systems are assumed to be usually associated with the lack of chromosome-wide gene dose regulatory mechanisms. Here we document that although the pygopodid geckos evolved male heterogamety with a degenerated Y chromosome 32-72 million years ago, one species in particular, Burtons legless lizard (Lialis burtonis), does not possess dosage balance in the expression of genes in its X-specific region. We summarize studies on gene dose regulatory mechanisms in animals and conclude that there is in them no significant dichotomy between male and female heterogamety. We speculate that gene dose regulatory mechanisms are likely to be related to the general mechanisms of sex determination instead of type of heterogamety.",

    "abstract": "Neocortical pyramidal cells (PCs) display functional specializations defined by their excitatory and inhibitory circuit connectivity. For layer 2/3 (L2/3) PCs, little is known about the detailed relationship between their neuronal response properties, dendritic structure and their underlying circuit connectivity at the level of single cells. Here, we ask whether L2/3 PCs in mouse primary visual cortex (V1) differ in their functional intra- and interlaminar connectivity patterns, and how this relates to differences in visual response properties. Using a combined approach, we first characterized the orientation and direction tuning of individual L2/3 PCs with in vivo 2-photon calcium imaging. Subsequently, we performed excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input mapping of the same L2/3 PCs in brain slices using laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS).\n\nOur data from this structure-connectivity-function analysis show that the sources of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input are different in their laminar origin and horizontal location with respect to cell position: On average, L2/3 PCs receive more inhibition than excitation from within L2/3, whereas excitation dominates input from L4 and L5. Horizontally, inhibitory input originates from locations closer to the horizontal position of the soma, while excitatory input arises from more distant locations in L4 and L5. In L2/3, the excitatory and inhibitory inputs spatially overlap on average. Importantly, at the level of individual neurons, PCs receive inputs from presynaptic cells located spatially offset, vertically and horizontally, relative to the soma. These input offsets show a systematic correlation with the preferred orientation of the postsynaptic L2/3 PC in vivo. Unexpectedly, this correlation is higher for inhibitory input offsets within L2/3 than for excitatory input offsets. When relating the dendritic complexity of L2/3 PCs to their orientation tuning, we find that sharply tuned cells have a less complex apical tree compared to broadly tuned cells. These results indicate that the spatial input offsets of the functional input connectivity are linked to orientation preference, while the orientation selectivity of L2/3 PCs is more related to the dendritic complexity.",

    "abstract": "Hippocampal theta oscillations have a temporally asymmetric waveform shape, but it is not known if this theta asymmetry extends to all other cortical regions involved in spatial navigation and memory. Here, using both established and improved cycle-by-cycle analysis methods, we show that theta waveforms in the postrhinal cortex are also temporally asymmetric. On average, the falling phase of postrhinal theta cycles lasts longer than the subsequent rising phase. There are, however, rapid changes in both the instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous temporal asymmetry of postrhinal theta cycles. These rapid changes in amplitude and asymmetry are very poorly correlated, indicative of a mechanistic disconnect between these theta cycle features. We show that the instantaneous amplitude and asymmetry of postrhinal theta cycles differentially encode running speed. Although theta amplitude continues to increase at the fastest running speeds, temporal asymmetry of the theta waveform shape plateaus after medium speeds. Our results suggest that the amplitude and waveform shape of individual postrhinal theta cycles may be governed by partially independent mechanisms and emphasize the importance of employing a single cycle approach to understanding the genesis and behavioral correlates of cortical theta rhythms.",

Although global stress-dependent changes are well documented, contributions of individual neuron remodeling events to animal behavior modification are challenging to study. In response to environmental insults, C. elegans become stress-resistant dauers. Dauer entry induces amphid sensory-organ remodeling, in which bilateral AMsh glial cells expand and fuse, allowing embedded AWC chemosensory neurons to extend sensory receptive endings. We show that amphid remodeling accelerates dauer exit upon exposure to favorable conditions, and identify a G protein-coupled receptor, REMO-1, driving AMsh glia fusion, AWC neuron remodeling, and dauer exit. REMO-1 is expressed in and localizes to AMsh glia tips, is dispensable for other remodeling events, and promotes stress-induced expression of the remodeling receptor tyrosine kinase VER-1. Our results demonstrate how single-neuron structural changes affect animal behavior, identify key glial roles in stress-induced nervous system shape changes, and demonstrate that remodeling primes animals to respond to favorable conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated neurocognitive disorders persist in the era of antiretroviral therapy (ART). One factor that is elevated among persons with HIV (PWH) and independently associated with neurocognitive impairment is methamphetamine dependence (METH+). Such dependence may further increase cognitive impairment among PWH, by delaying HIV diagnosis (and thus, ART initiation), which has been posited to account for persistent cognitive impairment among PWH, despite subsequent treatment-related viral load suppression (VLS; [&le;]50 copies of the virus per milliliter in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid). This study examined the independent and combined (additive versus synergistic) effects of HIV and history of METH+ on the sustained attention and vigilance cognitive domain, while controlling for VLS.\n\nMethodsParticipants included 205 (median age=44 years; 77% males; HIV-/METH- n=67; HIV+/METH - n=49; HIV-/METH+ n=36; HIV+/METH+ n=53) individuals enrolled in the Translational Methamphetamine AIDS Research Center, who completed Conners and the 5- Choice continuous performance tests (CPTs).\n\nResultsMETH+ participants exhibited deficits in sustained attention and vigilance; however, these effects were not significant after excluding participants who had a positive urine toxicology screen for methamphetamine. Controlling for VLS, PWH did not have worse sustained attention and vigilance, but consistently displayed slower reaction times across blocks, relative to HIV-participants. There was no HIV x METH interaction on sustained attention and vigilance.\n\nConclusionsRecent methamphetamine use among METH+ people and detectable viral loads are detrimental to sustained attention and vigilance. These findings highlight the need for prompt diagnosis of HIV and initiation of ART, and METH use interventions.",

    "abstract": "The increased susceptibility of ripe fruit to fungal pathogens poses a substantial threat to crop production and marketability. Here, we coupled transcriptomic analyses with mutant studies to uncover critical processes associated with defenses and susceptibility in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit. Using unripe and ripe fruit inoculated with three fungal pathogens, we identified common pathogen responses reliant on chitinases, WRKY transcription factors, and reactive oxygen species detoxification. We established that the magnitude and diversity of defense responses do not significantly impact the interaction outcome, as susceptible ripe fruit mounted a strong defense response to pathogen infection. Then, to distinguish features of ripening that may be responsible for susceptibility, we utilized non-ripening tomato mutants that displayed different susceptibility patterns to fungal infection. Based on transcriptional and hormone profiling, susceptible tomato genotypes had losses in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis, while jasmonic acid accumulation and signaling coincided with defense activation in resistant fruit. We identified and validated a susceptibility factor, pectate lyase (PL). CRISPR-based knockouts of PL, but not polygalacturonase (PG2a), reduced susceptibility of ripe fruit by >50%. This study suggests that targeting specific genes that drive susceptibility is a viable strategy to improve the resistance of tomato fruit against fungal disease.\n\nHighlightIncreased susceptibility to fungal disease during tomato ripening is driven by the accumulation of susceptibility factors and not the lack of defense responses.",

    "abstract": "Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) and deglycosylation (CDDG) are a collection of rare pediatric disorders with symptoms that range from mild to life threatening. They typically affect multiple organ systems and usually present with neurological abnormalities including hypotonia, cognitive impairment, and intractable seizures. Several genes have been implicated in the thirty-six types of CDG, but currently NGLY1 is the only known CDDG gene. A common biological mechanism among CDG types and in CDDG is endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here, we develop two isogenic human cellular models of CDG (PMM2, the most prevalent type of CDG, and DPAGT1) and of the only CDDG (NGLY1) in an effort to identify drugs that can alleviate ER stress. Systematic phenotyping identified elevated ER stress and autophagy levels among other cellular and morphological phenotypes in each of the cellular models. We screened a complex drug library for compounds able to correct aberrant morphological phenotypes in each of the models using an agnostic phenotypic cell painting assay based on >300 cellular features. The image-based screen identified multiple candidate compounds able to correct aberrant morphology, and we show a subset of these are able to correct cellular and molecular defects in each of the models. These results provide new directions for the treatment of rare diseases of glycosylation and deglycosylation and a framework for new drug screening paradigms for more common neurodegenerative diseases characterized by ER stress.\n\nSummary sentenceNovel drug screening modality identifies compounds that correct aberrant molecular phenotypes in precision cellular models of glycosylation defects.",

In Lynch Syndrome (LS), one of the most highly prevalent cancer syndromes, nearly 90% of clinically observed missense variants are deemed \"variants of uncertain significance\" (VUS). To systematically resolve their functional status, we performed a massively parallel screen in human cells to identify loss-of-function missense variants in the key DNA mismatch repair factor MSH2. The resulting functional effect map is substantially complete, covering 94% of the 17,746 possible variants, and is highly concordant (96%) with existing functional data and expert clinicians interpretations. The large majority (89%) of missense variants were functionally neutral, perhaps unexpectedly in light of its evolutionary conservation. These data provide ready-to-use functional evidence to resolve the [~]1,300 extant missense VUSs in MSH2, and may facilitate the prospective classification of newly discovered variants in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Refractive errors are the most common ocular disorders and are a leading cause of visual impairment worldwide. Although ocular axial length is well established to be a major determinant of refractive errors, the molecular and cellular processes regulating ocular axial growth are poorly understood. Mutations in genes encoding the PRSS56 and MFRP are a major cause of nanophthalmos. Accordingly, mouse models with mutations in the genes encoding the retinal factor PRSS56 or MFRP, a gene predominantly localized in the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) exhibit ocular axial length reduction and extreme hyperopia. However, the precise mechanisms underlying PRSS56- and MFRP-mediated ocular axial growth remain elusive. Here, we show that Adamts19 expression is significantly upregulated in retina of mice lacking either Prss56 or Mfrp. Using a combination of genetic approaches and mouse models, we show that while ADAMTS19 is not required for ocular growth during normal development, its inactivation exacerbates ocular axial length reduction in both Prss56 or Mfrp mutant mice. These results suggest that the upregulation of retinal Adamts19 expression is part of an adaptive molecular response to counteract impaired ocular growth. Using a complementary genetic approach. We further demonstrate that loss of PRSS56 or MFRP function prevents excessive ocular axial growth in a mouse model of developmental myopia caused by a null mutation in Irpb, demonstrating that ocular axial elongation in Irbp-/- mice is fully dependent on PRSS56 and MFRP functions. Collectively, our findings provide insight into the molecular network involved in ocular axial growth regulation and refractive development and support the notion that relay of the signal between the retina and RPE could be critical for promoting ocular axial elongation.",

Here, we present an in silico saturation mutagenesis approach to identify all driver mutations in 568 cancer genes across 66 tumor types. For most cancer genes the mutation probability across tissues --underpinned by active mutational processes-- influences which driver variants have been observed, although this differs significantly between tumor suppressor and oncogenes.

    "abstract": "Teleost fish can synthesize one of the major omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFAs), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), from dietary -linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3n-3), via elongase of very long chain fatty acid (Elovl) and fatty acid desaturase (Fads). However, it remains unclear which elongase is responsible for the endogenous synthesis of DHA. Here in this study, the knockout models of the two major elongases, Elovl2 and Elovl5, were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 approach in zebrafish and comparatively analyzed. The homozygous mutants were validated by Sanger sequencing, mutation-mediated PCR and whole-mount in situ hybridization analysis of the endogenous target genes. Compared with wildtype (WT) counterparts, the content of DHA was significantly reduced by 67.1% (p<0.05) in the adult liver and by 91.7% (p<0.01) in the embryo at 3 day-post-fertilization (dpf) of the elovl2 mutant, but not of the elovl5 mutant. Further study revealed that elovl2 and fads2 was upregulated by 9.9-fold (p<0.01) and 9.7-fold (p<0.01) in the elovl5 mutant, and elovl5 and fads2 was upregulated by 15.1-fold (p<0.01) and 21.5-fold (p<0.01) in the elovl2 mutant. Our study indicates that although both Elovl2 and Elovl5 have the elongase activity toward C20, the upregulation of elovl2 could completely replace the genetic depletion of elovl5, but upregulation of elovl5 could not compensate the endogenous deficiency of elovl2 in mediating DHA synthesis. In conclusion, the endogenous synthesis of DHA in is mediated by Elovl2 but not Elovl5 in teleost, and a DHA-deficient genetic model of zebrafish has been generated.",

Any deviation of the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity will reduce the predictive values of the test. Here, we report the occurrence of contaminations of commercial primers/probe sets with the SARS-CoV-2 target sequence of the RT-qPCR as an example for pitfalls during PCR diagnostics affecting diagnostic specificity. In several purchased in-house primers/probe sets, quantification cycle values as low as 17 were measured for negative control samples. However, there were also primers/probe sets that displayed very low-level contaminations, which were detected only during thorough internal validation. Hence, it appears imperative to pre-test each batch of reagents extensively before use in routine diagnosis, to avoid false-positive results and low positive predictive value in low-prevalence situations. As such, contaminations may have happened more widely, COVID-19 diagnostic results should be re-assessed retrospectively to validate the epidemiological basis for control measures.",

The most recent ASF outbreak in Vietnam occurred in 2019, posing a threat to spread to the neighboring Asian countries.

While the diagnosis method of ASF recommended by the World Organization of Animal Health is real-time PCR, it is not suitable for in-field detection of the disease. In this study, a colorimetric Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay was developed and evaluated for ASF virus detection using crude serum samples collected from domestic pigs in Vietnam during the 2019 outbreak. The LAMP results can be readily visualized to naked eyes within 30 minutes without the requirement of DNA extraction and sophisticated equipment. The sensitivity, specificity, and limit of detection of colorimetric LAMP assay were comparable to a commercial diagnostic real-time PCR kit. Results strongly indicate that the developed colorimetric LAMP assay is highly recommended for the in-field diagnosis of ASF.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression signatures (GES) connect phenotypes to mRNA expression patterns, providing a powerful approach to define cellular identity, function, and the effects of perturbations. However, the use of GES has suffered from vague assessment criteria and limited reproducibility. The structure of proteins defines the functional capability of genes, and hence, we hypothesized that enrichment of structural features could be a generalizable representation of gene sets. We derive structural gene expression signatures (sGES) using features from various levels of protein structure (e.g. domain, fold) encoded by the transcribed genes in GES, to describe cellular phenotypes. Comprehensive analyses of data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), ARCHS4, and mRNA expression of drug effects on cardiomyocytes show that structural GES (sGES) are useful for identifying robust signatures of biological phenomena. sGES also enables the characterization of signatures across experimental platforms, facilitates the interoperability of expression datasets, and can describe drug action on cells.",

    "abstract": "The Ras family of proteins is known to play an important role in cellular signal transduction. The oncoprotein Ras is also found to be mutated in [~]90% of the pancreatic cancers, of which G12V, G13V, A59G and Q61L are the known hot-spot mutants. These ubiquitous proteins fall in the family of G-proteins, and hence switches between active GTP bound and inactive GDP bound states, which is hindered in most of its oncogenic mutant counterparts. Moreover, Ras being a GTPase has an intrinsic property to hydrolyze GTP to GDP, which is obstructed due to mutations and lends the mutants stuck in constitutively active state leading to oncogenic behavior. In this regard, the present study aims to understand the dynamics involved in the hot-spot mutant A59G-Ras using long classical MD simulations ([~]10{micro}s) and comparing the same with its wild-type counterpart. Advanced analytics using Markov State Model (MSM) based approach has been deployed to comparatively understand the transition path for the wild-type and mutant systems. Roles of crucial residues like Tyr32, Gln61 and Tyr64 have also been established using multivariate PCA analyses. Furthermore, this multivariate PCA analysis also provides crucial features which may be used as reaction coordinates for biased simulations for further studies. The absence of formation of pre-hydrolysis network is also reported for the mutant conformation, using the distance-based analyses (between crucial residues) of the conserved regions. The implications of this study strengthen the hypothesis that the disruption of the pre-hydrolysis network in the mutant A59G ensemble might lead to permanently active oncogenic conformation in the mutant conformers.",

    "abstract": "Myxobacteria and dictyostelids are prokaryotic and eukaryotic multicellular lineages, respectively, that after nutrient depletion aggregate and develop into structures called fruiting bodies. The developmental processes and the resulting morphological outcomes resemble one another to a remarkable extent despite their independent origins, the evolutionary distance between them and the lack of traceable levels of homology in the molecular mechanisms of the groups. We hypothesize that the morphological parallelism between the two lineages arises as the consequence of the interplay, within multicellular aggregates, between generic processes, physical and physicochemical processes operating similarly in living and non-living matter at the mesoscale (~10-3-10-1 m) and agent-like behaviors, unique to living systems, characteristic of the constituent cells. To this effect, we analyze the relative contribution of the generic and agent-like determinants in the main phenomena of myxobacteria and dictyostelid development, and their roles in the emergence of their shared traits. We show that as a consequence of aggregation collective cell-cell contacts mediate the emergence of liquid-like properties, making nascent multicellular masses subject to new sets of patterning and morphogenetic processes. In both lineages, this leads to behaviors such as streaming, rippling, and rounding up, similar to effects observed in non-living fluids. Later the aggregates solidify, leading them to exhibit additional generic properties and motifs. We consider evidence that the morphological phenotypes of the multicellular masses deviate from the predictions of generic physics due to the contribution of agent-like behaviors. These include directed migration, quiescence, and oscillatory signal transduction of the cells mediated by responses to external cues acting through species-specific regulatory and signaling mechanisms reflecting the evolutionary histories of the respective organisms. We suggest that the similar developmental trajectories of Myxobacteria and Dictyostelia are more plausibly due to shared generic physical processes in coordination with analogous agent-type behaviors than to convergent evolution under parallel selection regimes. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of the existence and synergy of these two categories of developmental factors for evolutionary theory.",

    "abstract": "Precision medicine holds great promise for improving health and reducing health disparities that can be most fully realized by advancing diversity and inclusion in research participants. Without engaging underrepresented groups, precision medicine could not only fail to achieve its promise but also further exacerbate the health disparities already burdening the most vulnerable. Yet underrepresentation by people of non-European ancestry continues in precision medicine research and there are disparities across racial groups in the uptake of precision medicine applications and services. Studies have explored possible explanations for population differences in precision medicine participation, but full appreciation of the factors involved is still developing. To better inform the potential for addressing health disparities through PM, we assessed the relationship of precision medicine knowledge and trust in biomedical research with sociodemographic variables. Using a series of linear regression models applied to survey data collected in a diverse sample, we analyzed variation in both precision medicine knowledge and trust in biomedical research with socioeconomic factors as a way to understand the range of precision medicine knowledge (PMK) in a broadly representative group and its relationship to trust in research and demographic characteristics. Our results demonstrate that identifying as Black, while significantly PMK, explains only 1.5% of the PMK variance in unadjusted models and 7% of overall variance in models adjusted for meaningful covariates such as age, marital status, employment, and education. We also found a positive association between PMK and trust in biomedical research. These results indicate that race is a factor affecting PMK, even after accounting for differences in sociodemographic variables. Additional work is needed, however, to identify other factors contributing to variation in PMK as we work to increase diversity and inclusion in precision medicine applications.",

    "abstract": "1.Imprinted genes help mediate embryonic cell proliferation and differentiation, but their roles after birth are far less well understood. A subset of 16 imprinted gene network (IGN) genes is expressed at higher levels in stem cell progenitor cells of adult skeletal muscle and epidermis compared to their differentiated counterparts. While these genes function in muscle regeneration, their role in the skin is poorly understood. We assessed the expression profiles of these 16 IGN genes in publicly available datasets and revealed elevated expression of IGN genes in the telogen and early anagen phases in mouse skin. We also identified IGN genes among a list of previously identified hair cycle-associated genes. Furthermore, our results suggest that IGN genes form part of a larger network and function predominantly as upstream regulators of hair cycle-regulated genes. Based on these in silico data, we propose a potential novel role of these 16 IGN genes as upstream regulators of hair cycle-associated genes. We speculate that IGN gene dysregulation participates in syndromes characterized by an impaired hair cycle. Thus, IGN gene expression might serve as a point of therapeutic intervention for patients suffering from cutaneous pathologies such as common hair-loss disorders.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for a vaccine with efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesize that peptide vaccines containing epitope regions optimized for concurrent B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell stimulation would drive both humoral and cellular immunity with high specificity, potentially avoiding undesired effects such as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Additionally, such vaccines can be rapidly manufactured in a distributed manner. In this study, we combine computational prediction of T cell epitopes, recently published B cell epitope mapping studies, and epitope accessibility to select candidate peptide vaccines for SARS-CoV-2. We begin with an exploration of the space of possible T cell epitopes in SARS-CoV-2 with interrogation of predicted HLA-I and HLA-II ligands, overlap between predicted ligands, protein source, as well as concurrent human/murine coverage. Beyond MHC affinity, T cell vaccine candidates were further refined by predicted immunogenicity, viral source protein abundance, sequence conservation, coverage of high frequency HLA alleles and co-localization of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. B cell epitope regions were chosen from linear epitope mapping studies of convalescent patient serum, followed by filtering to select regions with surface accessibility, high sequence conservation, spatial localization near functional domains of the spike glycoprotein, and avoidance of glycosylation sites. From 58 initial candidates, three B cell epitope regions were identified. By combining these B cell and T cell analyses, as well as a manufacturability heuristic, we propose a set of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine peptides for use in subsequent murine studies and clinical trials.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/135004v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fc6599org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1725a45org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@84a233org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b4c7aa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Neural coding and memory formation depend on temporal spiking sequences that span high-dimensional neural ensembles. The unsupervised discovery and characterization of these spiking sequences requires a suitable dissimilarity measure to spiking patterns, which can then be used for clustering and decoding. Here, we present a new dissimilarity measure based on optimal transport theory called SpikeShip, which compares multineuron spiking patterns based on all the relative spike-timing relationships among neurons. SpikeShip computes the optimal transport cost to make all the relative spike-timing relationships (across neurons) identical between two spiking patterns. We show that this transport cost can be decomposed into a temporal rigid translation term, which captures global latency shifts, and a vector of neuron-specific transport flows, which reflect inter-neuronal spike timing differences. SpikeShip can be effectively computed for high-dimensional neuronal ensembles, has a low (linear) computational cost that has the same order as the spike count, and is sensitive to higher-order correlations. Furthermore SpikeShip is binless, can handle any form of spike time distributions, is not affected by firing rate fluctuations, can detect patterns with a low signal-to-noise ratio, and can be effectively combined with a sliding window approach. We compare the advantages and differences between SpikeShip and other measures like SPIKE and Victor-Purpura distance. We applied SpikeShip to large-scale Neuropixel recordings during spontaneous activity and visual encoding. We show that high-dimensional spiking sequences detected via SpikeShip reliably distinguish between different natural images and different behavioral states. These spiking sequences carried complementary information to conventional firing rate codes. SpikeShip opens new avenues for studying neural coding and memory consolidation by rapid and unsupervised detection of temporal spiking patterns in high-dimensional neural ensembles.",

    "abstract": "Ploidy is the number of whole sets of chromosomes in a species. Ploidy is typically a stable cellular feature that is critical for survival. Polyploidization is a route recognized to increase gene dosage, improve fitness under stressful conditions and promote evolutionary diversity. However, the mechanism of regulation and maintenance of ploidy is not well characterized. Here, we examine the spontaneous diploidization associated with mutations in components of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae centrosome, known as the spindle pole body (SPB). Although SPB mutants are associated with defects in spindle formation, we show that two copies of the mutant in a haploid yeast favors diploidization in some cases, leading us to speculate that the increased gene dosage in diploids  rescues SPB duplication defects, allowing cells to successfully propagate with a stable diploid karyotype. This copy number-based rescue is linked to SPB scaling: certain SPB subcomplexes do not scale or only minimally scale with ploidy. We hypothesize that acquisition of lesions in structures with incompatible allometries such as the centrosome may drive changes such as whole genome duplication, which have shaped the evolutionary landscape of many eukaryotes.\n\nAuthor SummaryPloidy is the number of whole sets of chromosomes in a species. Most eukaryotes alternate between a diploid (two copy) and haploid (one copy) state during their life and sexual cycle. However, as part of normal human development, specific tissues increase their DNA content. This gain of entire sets of chromosomes is known as polyploidization, and it is observed in invertebrates, plants and fungi, as well. Polyploidy is thought to improve fitness under stressful conditions and promote evolutionary diversity, but how ploidy is determined is poorly understood. Here, we use budding yeast to investigate mechanisms underlying the ploidy of wild-type cells and specific mutants that affect the centrosome, a conserved structure involved in chromosome segregation during cell division. Our work suggests that different scaling relationships (allometry) between the genome and cellular structures underlies alterations in ploidy. Furthermore, mutations in cellular structures with incompatible allometric relationships with the genome may drive genomic changes such duplications, which are underly the evolution of many species including both yeasts and humans.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sgg) is an emerging opportunistic pathogen responsible for septicemia and endocarditis in the elderly. Invasive infections by Sgg are strongly linked to the occurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC). It was previously shown that increased secondary bile salts in CRC-conditions enhances the bactericidal activity of gallocin, a bacteriocin produced by Sgg, enabling it to colonize the mouse colon by outcompeting resident enterococci. In a separate study, we have shown that Sgg produces and secretes a 21-mer peptide that activates bacteriocin production. This peptide was named CSP because of its sequence similarity with competence stimulating peptides found in other streptococci. Here we demonstrate that CSP is a bona fide quorum-sensing peptide involved in activation of gallocin gene transcription. We therefore refer to CSP as GSP (gallocin stimulating peptide). GSP displays some unique features since its N-terminal amino-acid lies three residues after the double glycine leader sequence. Herein, we set out to investigate the processing and export pathway that leads to mature GSP. We also conducted the first comprehensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) of Sgg GSP to identify its key structural features.\n\nSignificanceStreptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus (Sgg) is an opportunistic pathogen associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) and endocarditis. Sgg utilizes quorum-sensing (QS) to regulate the production of a bacteriocin (gallocin) and gain selective advantage in colonizing the colon. In this manuscript, we report 1) the first structure-activty relationship study of the Sgg QS pheromone that regulates gallocin production; 2) evidence that the active QS pheromone is processed to its mature form by a unique ABC transporter and not processed by an extracellular protease; and 3) supporting evidence of interspecies interactions between streptococci pheromones. Our results revealed the minimal pheromone scaffold needed for gallocin activation and uncovered unique interactions between two streptococci species QS signals that warrant further studies.",

Biofilms were quantified and imaged with confocal and scanning electron microscopy. In the second method, biofilms were grown on bioabsorbable collagen coupons in a modified CDC biofilm reactor. Coupons were immersed in treatment for 24 h. The first method was limited in its ability to assess efficacy. Efficacy profiles against biofilms grown on collagen were more definitive, with CZ-01179 gel eradicating well-established biofilms to a greater degree compared to clinical standards.

    "abstract": "Resolving the COVID-19 pandemic requires diagnostic testing to determine which individuals are infected and which are not. The current gold standard is to perform RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal samples. Best-in-class assays demonstrate a limit of detection (LoD) of ~100 copies of viral RNA per milliliter of transport media. However, LoDs of currently approved assays vary over 10,000-fold. Assays with higher LoDs will miss more infected patients, resulting in more false negatives. However, the false-negative rate for a given LoD remains unknown. Here we address this question using over 27,500 test results for patients from across our healthcare network tested using the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA. These results suggest that each 10-fold increase in LoD is expected to increase the false negative rate by 13%, missing an additional one in eight infected patients. The highest LoDs on the market will miss a majority of infected patients, with false negative rates as high as 70%. These results suggest that choice of assay has meaningful clinical and epidemiological consequences. The limit of detection matters.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence shows that the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is highly sensitive to interferons (IFNs). However, the underlying antiviral effectors remain to be defined. Here, we show that Zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) that specifically targets CpG dinucleotides in viral RNA sequences restricts SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that ZAP and its cofactors KHNYN and TRIM25 are expressed in human lung cells. Type I, II and III IFNs all strongly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 and further induced ZAP expression. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 and its closest relatives from bats show the strongest CpG suppression among all known human and bat coronaviruses, respectively. Nevertheless, knock-down of ZAP significantly increased SARS-CoV-2 production in lung cells, particularly upon treatment with IFN- or IFN-{gamma}. Thus, our results identify ZAP as an effector of the IFN response against SARS-CoV-2, although this pandemic pathogen may be preadapted to the low CpG environment in humans.\n\nHighlightsO_LISARS-CoV-2 and its closest bat relatives show strong CpG suppression\nC_LIO_LIIFN-{beta}, -{gamma} and -{lambda} inhibit SARS-CoV-2 with high efficiency\nC_LIO_LIZAP restricts SARS-CoV-2 and contributes to the antiviral effect of IFNs\nC_LI",

Though knowledge of cervical cancer is an important determinant of women\u2019s participation in prevention and screening for cervical cancer, little is known about this topic in Nepal. This study explores the experiences of cervical cancer survivors and assesses the attitude of family and community towards it and stigma related to this disease in Bharatpur, Nepal.Methods The study design is qualitative methods involving two focus-group discussions. A total of 17 cervical cancer survivors were selected purposively from Chitwan. All qualitative data were transcribed and translated into English and were thematically analyzed.Results Majority of the participants had scant knowledge about cervical cancer, its causative agent, showed less cervical cancer screening, delayed healthcare-seeking behavior despite having persistent symptoms before the diagnosis. The main reasons identified for not uptaking the cervical screening methods are an embarrassment and having no symptoms at all. Most of them endured social stigma related to cervical cancer in the form of physical isolation and verbal abuse.Conclusions There is an urgent need for interventions to make women and the public aware of cervical cancer and launch effective health education campaigns, policies for cervical cancer prevention programs. This implementation can save the lives of hundreds of women and help them avoid going through all the negative experiences related to cervical cancer. More studies are required to gain the perspectives, knowledge, experiences, and attitudes of cervical cancer survivors to add to the research.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool has the potential to improve the livestock breeding industry by allowing for the introduction of desirable traits. Although an efficient and targeted tool, the CRISPR/Cas9 system can have some drawbacks, including off-target mutations and mosaicism, particularly when used in developing embryos. Here, we introduced genome editing reagents into single-cell bovine embryos to compare the effect of Cas9 mRNA and protein on the mutation efficiency, level of mosaicism, and evaluate potential off-target mutations utilizing next generation sequencing. We designed guide-RNAs targeting three loci (POLLED, H11, and ZFX) in the bovine genome and saw a significantly higher rate of mutation in embryos injected with Cas9 protein (84.2%) vs. Cas9 mRNA (68.5%). In addition, the level of mosaicism was higher in embryos injected with Cas9 mRNA (100%) compared to those injected with Cas9 protein (94.2%), with little to no unintended off-target mutations detected. This study demonstrates that the use of Cas9 protein, rather than Cas9 mRNA, results in a higher editing efficiency in bovine embryos while lowering the level of mosaicism. However, further optimization must be carried out for the CRISPR/Cas9 system to become feasible for single-step embryo editing in a commercial system.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti are feared invasive mosquitoes as they transmit pathogens which cause debilitating diseases in humans. Although mainland Europe has not yet witnessed re-establishment and diffusion of Ae. aegypti populations, several urban areas along coastlines represent suitable habitats for the species. In addition, European coastal areas are characterized by a high exotic species propagule pressure, due to the dense international ship traffic.\n\nHere, we applied a process-based population dynamical model to simulate both the life cycle and dispersal of Ae. aegypti at the local scale after its introduction through ship traffic. We selected five European ports along a gradient of latitude by considering both environmental conditions and the economical importance of ports: Algeciras and Barcelona in Spain; Venice and Genoa in Italy and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The model was informed using parameters relevant for Ae. aegypti biology, fine-scale temperature time-series, urban structures and road networks.\n\nAccording to model results, the introduction of small quantities of Ae. aegypti eggs, from 10 to 1000, has the potential to cause species establishment, high local densities and slow initial dispersal in the two southernmost study areas, Algeciras and Barcelona, whereas Genoa may be considered only close to suitability. Barcelona had the highest simulated mosquito densities (584 females/ha), whereas Algeciras densities were never more than 32 females/ha, but remained higher during winter. The spatial spread of the species varied between a few hundred meters to 2 km/year and was affected by the structure of the road network, topography and urban sprawl along the coast in the surrounding of the port of introduction. The study areas of Genoa, Venice and Rotterdam were found not suitable for establishment of this mosquito species, however climate change could create conditions for Ae. aegypti invasion in these regions in the next decades.\n\nIt is commonly accepted that targeted monitoring and early control actions are the most effective methods to hinder the establishment of invasive species in new areas. Our findings and model framework may support surveillance initiatives for those European coastal urban areas which have a known high propagule pressure and a high modelled probability of Ae. aegypti establishment.\n\nHighlightsO_LIEuropean coasts present favourable conditions for Aedes aegypti establishment\nC_LIO_LIWe assess the species introduction and establishment using a process-based model\nC_LIO_LIWe selected five ports: Algeciras, Barcelona, Venice, Genoa and Rotterdam\nC_LIO_LIAlgeciras and Barcelona were the most suitable areas for the species establishment\nC_LIO_LIClimate change could make more suitable the northernmost study areas\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Residential yards constitute a substantive biodiverse greenspace within urban areas. This biodiversity results from a combination of native and non-native species and can contribute to biotic homogenization. Geographical climatic patterns affect the distribution of native species and may differently affect non-native species. In this study, we examined biodiversity and biotic homogenization patterns of yard-dwelling land snails across 12 towns in Oklahoma and Kansas (USA). The 3 x 4 array of towns incorporated a N-S winter temperature gradient (mean low January temperature range = -8.4 to 0.1 {degrees}C) and an E-W annual rainfall gradient (annual rainfall range = 113.8 to 61.3 cm/yr). Ten yards per town were surveyed. We hypothesized that mild winter temperatures and greater annual rainfall would be associated with greater snail abundance and richness, and that the presence of non-native species would contribute to biotic homogenization. Non-native snails were present and often abundant in all towns. Snail communities varied with both rainfall and cold temperature. Contrary to our prediction, snail abundance was inversely related to annual rainfall - likely because drier conditions resulted in greater yard watering that both augmented rainfall and maintained moist conditions. Sorensen similarity between towns for the entire land snail community and for only non-native species both showed distance-decay patterns, with snail composition becoming less similar with increasing distance - patterns resulting from species turnover. The biotic homogenization index also showed a distance-decay pattern, such that closer towns were more likely to have biotic homogenization whereas more distant towns tended to have biotic differentiation. These results support the concept that biotic homogenization is more likely regionally and that climatic changes over distance result in species turnover and can reduce spatially broad biotic homogenization.",

Mining and using genes that control important rice grain quality characteristics are major tasks for plant breeders. Here, a genome-wide association study was conducted to determine the genetic bases of 12 rice grain quality traits in 113 varieties and 565 testcross hybrids. A total of 56 significant SNPs were associated with 9 of the traits in variety phenotypic, general combining ability, testcross hybrid phenotypic and mid-parental heterotic datasets, from which 45 novel loci were identified. The cumulative effects of superior alleles or favorable haplotypes of genes closest to significant quality trait-associated loci were found in the four datasets. Additionally, the favorable gene haplotypes performed better than those of superior alleles in the variety and testcross hybrid datasets. Pyramiding the favorable haplotypes of five cloned rice grain quality genes resulted in a very low amylose content and high yield in the latter. These testcross hybrids had rice grain qualities similar to their parental lines but with much higher yields. The amylose content, grain width and grain length predictions for potential hybrids among the 113 varieties using genomic selection based on the BayesB method revealed a performance trend similar to those the testcross hybrids in our study. Thus, the selection of combination of favorable rice quality-related gene haplotypes is recommended to breed hybrids with high yields and elite grain qualities.",

    "abstract": "Genome integrity is particularly important in germ cells to faithfully preserve genetic information across generations. As yet little is known about the contribution of various DNA repair pathways to prevent mutagenesis. Using the C. elegans model we analyse mutational spectra that arise in wild-type and 61 DNA repair and DNA damage response mutants cultivated over multiple generations. Overall, 44% of lines show >2-fold increased mutagenesis with a broad spectrum of mutational outcomes including changes in single or multiple types of base substitutions induced by defects in base excision or nucleotide excision repair, or elevated levels of 50-400 bp deletions in translesion polymerase mutants rev-3(pol {zeta}) and polh-1(pol {eta}). Mutational signatures associated with defective homologous recombination fall into two classes: 1) mutants lacking brc-1/BRCA1 or rad-51/RAD51 paralogs show elevated base substitutions, indels and structural variants, while 2) deficiency for MUS-81/MUS81 and SLX-1/SLX1 nucleases, and HIM-6/BLM, HELQ-1/HELQ and RTEL-1/RTEL1 helicases primarily cause structural variants. Genome-wide investigation of mutagenesis patterns identified elevated rates of tandem duplications often associated with inverted repeats in helq-1 mutants, and a unique pattern of  translocation events involving homeologous sequences in rip-1 paralog mutants. atm-1/ATM DNA damage checkpoint mutants harboured complex structural variants enriched in subtelomeric regions, and chromosome end-to-end fusions. Finally, while inactivation of the p53-like gene cep-1 did not affect mutagenesis, combined brc-1 cep-1 deficiency displayed increased, locally clustered mutagenesis. In summary, we provide a global view of how DNA repair pathways prevent germ cell mutagenesis.",

    "abstract": "Rho family GTPases regulate an array of cellular processes and are often modulated by pathogens to promote infection. Here, we identify a cryptic guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain in the OtDUB protein encoded by the pathogenic bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi. A proteomics-based OtDUB interaction screen identified numerous potential host interactors, including the Rho-GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42. We discovered a new domain in OtDUB with Rac1/Cdc42 GEF activity (OtDUBGEF), with higher activity toward Rac1 in vitro. While this GEF bears no obvious sequence similarity to known GEFs, crystal structures of OtDUBGEF alone (3.0 [A]) and complexed with Rac1 (1.7 [A]) reveal striking convergent evolution, with a distinct topology, on a V-shaped bacterial GEF fold shared with other bacterial GEF domains. Structure-guided mutational analyses identified residues critical for activity and a novel mechanism for nucleotide displacement. Ectopic expression of OtDUB activates Rac1 preferentially in cells, and expression of the OtDUBGEF alone alters cell morphology. Cumulatively, this work reveals a novel bacterial GEF within the multifunctional OtDUB that co-opts host Rac1 signaling to evoke changes in cytoskeletal structure.",

    "abstract": "In the ocean, viruses impact microbial mortality, regulate biogeochemical cycling, and alter the metabolic potential of microbial lineages. At deep-sea hydrothermal vents, abundant viruses infect a wide range of hosts among the archaea and bacteria that inhabit these dynamic habitats. However, little is known about viral diversity, host range, and biogeography across different vent ecosystems, which has important implications for how viruses manipulate microbial function and evolution. Here, we examined viral diversity, viral and host distribution, and viral-host interactions in microbial metagenomes generated from venting fluids from several vent sites within three different geochemically and geographically distinct hydrothermal systems: Piccard and Von Damm vent fields at the Mid-Cayman Rise in the Caribbean Sea, and at several vent sites within Axial Seamount in the Pacific Ocean. Analysis of viral sequences and Clustered Regularly InterSpaced Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) spacers revealed highly diverse viral assemblages and evidence of active infection. Network analysis revealed that viral host range was relatively narrow, with very few viruses infecting multiple microbial lineages. Viruses were largely endemic to individual vent sites, indicating restricted dispersal, and in some cases viral assemblages persisted over time. Thus, we show that hydrothermal vent fluids are home to novel, diverse viral assemblages that are highly localized to specific regions and taxa.\n\nImportanceViruses play important roles in manipulating microbial communities and their evolution in the ocean, yet not much is known about viruses in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. However, viral ecology and evolution are of particular interest in hydrothermal vent habitats because of their unique nature: previous studies have indicated that most viruses in hydrothermal vents are temperate rather than lytic, and it has been established that rates of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) are particularly high among thermophilic vent microbes, and viruses are common vectors for HGT. If viruses have broad host range or are widespread across vent sites, they have increased potential to act as gene-sharing \"highways\" between vent sites. By examining viral diversity, distribution, and infection networks across disparate vent sites, this study provides the opportunity to better characterize and constrain the viral impact on hydrothermal vent microbial communities. We show that viruses in hydrothermal vents are diverse and apparently active, but most have restricted host range and are not widely distributed among vent sites. Thus, the impacts of viral infection are likely to be highly localized and constrained to specific taxa in these habitats.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems are inhabited by members of cosmopolitan bacterioplankton lineages despite the disconnected nature of these habitats. The lineages are delineated based on >97% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, but their intra-lineage microdiversity and phylogeography, which are key to understanding the eco-evolutional processes behind their ubiquity, remain unresolved. Here, we applied long-read amplicon sequencing targeting nearly full-length 16S rRNA genes and the adjacent ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequences to reveal the intra-lineage diversities of pelagic bacterioplankton assemblages in 11 deep freshwater lakes in Japan and Europe. Our single nucleotide-resolved analysis, which was validated using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, uncovered 7-101 amplicon sequence variants for each of the 11 predominant bacterial lineages and demonstrated sympatric, allopatric, and temporal microdiversities that could not be resolved through conventional approaches. Clusters of samples with similar intra-lineage population compositions were identified, which consistently supported genetic isolation between Japan and Europe. At a regional scale (up to hundreds of kilometers), dispersal between lakes was unlikely to be a limiting factor, and environmental factors were potential determinants of population composition. The extent of microdiversification varied among lineages, suggesting that highly diversified lineages (e.g., Iluma-A2 and acI-A1) achieve their ubiquity by containing a consortium of genotypes specific to each habitat, while less diversified lineages (e.g., CL500-11) may be ubiquitous due to a small number of widespread genotypes. The lowest extent of intra-lineage diversification was observed among the dominant hypolimnion-specific lineage (CL500-11), suggesting that their dispersal among lakes is not limited despite the hypolimnion being a more isolated habitat than the epilimnion. Our novel approach complemented the limited resolution of short-read amplicon sequencing and limited sensitivity of the metagenome assembly-based approach, and highlighted the complex ecological processes underlying the ubiquity of freshwater bacterioplankton lineages.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia patients often manifest semantic processing deficits. It has been proposed that these deficits stem from disorganized semantic representations in the brain. However, no study has yet examined the neural correlates of semantic disorganization by directly evaluating semantic representations in the brain. We used voxelwise modeling on functional magnetic resonance imaging signals to evaluate the semantic representations associated with several thousand words in individual patient brains. We then compared the structural properties of semantic representations to those in healthy controls. The variability of semantic representations was smaller both within individual patients and across patients compared to controls. Surrogate data analysis suggests that the observed reduction in representational variability is associated with disorganization of categorical information. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first evidence for sematic disorganization in schizophrenia at the level of brain representations.",

    "abstract": "The Sox family of transcription factors regulate many processes during metazoan development, including stem cell maintenance and nervous system specification. Characterising the repertoires and roles of these genes can therefore provide important insights into animal evolution and development. We further characterised the Sox repertoires of several arachnid species with and without an ancestral whole genome duplication (WGD), and compared their expression between the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum and the harvestman Phalangium opilio. We also found that most Sox families have been retained as ohnologs after WGD and evidence for potential subfunctionalisation and/or neofunctionalization events. Our results also suggest that Sox21b-1 likely regulated segmentation ancestrally in arachnids, playing a similar role to the closely related SoxB gene, Dichaete, in insects. We previously showed that Sox21b-1 is required for the simultaneous formation of prosomal segments and sequential addition of opisthosomal segments in P. tepidariorum. We studied the expression and function of Sox21b-1 further in this spider and found that while this gene regulates the generation of both prosomal and opisthosomal segments, it plays different roles in the formation of these tagmata reflecting their contrasting modes of segmentation and deployment of gene regulatory networks with different architectures.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism(s) through which mammalian kinase MELK promotes tumorigenesis is not understood. We find that the C. elegans orthologue of MELK, PIG-1, promotes apoptosis by partitioning an anti-apoptotic factor. The C. elegans NSM neuroblast divides to produce a larger cell that differentiates into a neuron and a smaller cell that dies. We find that in this context, PIG-1 is required for partitioning of CES-1 Snail, a transcriptional repressor of the pro-apoptotic gene egl-1 BH3-only. pig-1 MELK is controlled by both a ces-1 Snail- and par-4 LKB1-dependent pathway, and may act through phosphorylation and cortical enrichment of nonmuscle myosin II prior to neuroblast division. We propose that pig-1 MELK-induced local contractility of the actomyosin network plays a conserved role in the acquisition of the apoptotic fate. Our work also uncovers an auto-regulatory loop through which ces-1 Snail controls its own activity through the formation of a gradient of CES-1 Snail protein.\n\nSignificance StatementApoptosis is critical for the elimination of  unwanted cells. What distinguishes wanted from unwanted cells in developing animals is poorly understood. We report that in the C. elegans NSM neuroblast lineage, the level of CES-1, a Snail-family member and transcriptional repressor of the pro-apoptotic gene egl-1, contributes to this process. In addition, we demonstrate that C. elegans PIG-1, the orthologue of mammalian proto-oncoprotein MELK, plays a critical role in controlling CES-1Snail levels. Specifically, during NSM neuroblast division, PIG-1MELK controls partitioning of CES-1Snail into one but not the other daughter cell thereby promoting the making of one wanted and one unwanted cell. Furthermore, we present evidence that PIG-1MELK acts prior to NSM neuroblast division by locally activating the actomyosin network.",

    "abstract": "There are few data considering human genetics as an important risk factor for birth abnormalities related to ZIKV infection during pregnancy, even though sub-Saharan African populations are apparently more resistant to CZS as compared to populations in the Americas. We hypothesized that single nucleotide variants (SNVs), especially in innate immune genes, could make some populations more susceptible to Zika congenital complications than others. Differences in the SNV frequencies among continental populations provide great potential for Machine Learning techniques. We explored a key immune genomic gradient between individuals from Africa, Asia and Latin America, working with complex signatures, using 297 SNVs. We employed a two-step approach. In the first step, decision trees (DTs) were used to extract the most discriminating SNVs among populations. In the second step, machine learning algorithms were used to evaluate the quality of the SNV pool identified in step one for discriminating between individuals from sub-Saharan African and Latin-American populations. Our results suggest that 10 SNVs from 10 genes (CLEC4M, CD58, OAS2, CD80, VEPH1, CTLA4, CD274, CD209, PLAAT4, CREB3L1) were able to discriminate sub-Saharan Africans from Latin American populations using only immune genome data, with an accuracy close to 100%. Moreover, we found that these SNVs form a genome gradient across the three main continental populations. These SNVs are important elements of the innate immune system and in the response against viruses. Our data support the Human Immune Genome Complex Gradient hypothesis as a new theory that may help to explain the CZS catastrophe in Brazil.",

Previous studies by our group and others have demonstrated fibroblasts possess regenerative activities. In the current study we demonstrated: a) fibroblasts inhibit mixed lymphocyte reaction; b) suppress T cell activation; c) inhibit DC maturation; and d) stimulate T regulatory (Treg) cell formation. Importantly, administration of fibroblasts in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis resulted in disease inhibition, which was abrogated upon depletion of Treg cells.

However, little is known about the seasonal dynamics of the bacterial communities inhabiting these lakes and the role of environmental factors that have the main impact on their structure. Therefore, two soda pans were sampled monthly between April 2013 and July 2014 to reveal changes in the planktonic community. By late spring in both years, a sudden shift in the community structure was observed, the previous algae-associated bacterial communities had collapsed, resulting the highest ratio of actinobacteria within the bacterioplankton (89%, with the dominance of acIII-A1 lineage) ever reported in the literature. Before these peaks, an extremely high abundance (>10,000 individuum l-1) of microcrustaceans (Moina and Arctodiaptomus) was observed. OTU-based statistical approaches showed that in addition to algal blooms and water-level fluctuations, zooplankton densities had the strongest effect on the composition of bacterial communities. In these extreme environments, this implies a surprisingly strong, community-shaping top-down role of microcrustacean grazers.",

KAP1 is required to sustain high levels of Tsix, thus reinforcing and propagating the asymmetry, and, as a result, marking the future active X chromosome. Furthermore, we show that RIF1 association with the future inactive X chromosome is essential for Xist upregulation. This double-bookmarking system, based on the mutually exclusive relationships of Tsix and RIF1, and RIF1 and KAP1, thus coordinates the identification of the inactive and active X chromosomes and initiates a self-sustaining loop that transforms an initially stochastic event into a stably inherited asymmetric X chromosome state.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota (GM)-bone axis has emerged as a crucial mediator in the maintenance of bone homeostasis. Estrogen-deficiency induced bone loss is closely associated with an altered GM. However, the underlying mechanisms remain not fully understood. To this end, feces samples collected from the postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis (PMO) and with normal bone mass (PMN) were examined by 16s rRNA gene sequencing. We found that GM in PMO group was featured by a significant decreased proportion of genus Prevotella in comparison with that in the PMN group. Next, Prevotella histicola (P.histicola), a typical specie of Prevotella, was orally given to the mice following the ovariectomy (OVX) procedure and it significantly prevented OVX induced bone loss. Mechanistically, the protective effects of P.histicola on bone mass were found to be associated with the inhibition of osteoclastic resorption by attenuating osteoclastogenic cytokines expression and ameliorating gut permeability. Thus, P.histicola may prevent estrogen-deficiency induced bone loss through the GM-bone axis.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriocins are natural antimicrobial peptides produced by bacteria to kill closely related competitors. The opportunistic pathogen Streptococcus gallolyticus (Sgg) was recently shown to outcompete commensal enterococci of the murine microbiota in tumoral conditions thanks to the production of a two-peptide bacteriocin named gallocin. We here identified 4 genes involved in the regulatory control of gallocin in Sgg UCN34, respectively encoding a histidine kinase/response regulator two-component system (BlpH/BlpR), a secreted peptide (GSP), and a putative regulator of unknown function (BlpS). While BlpR is a typical 243-aa response regulator possessing a phospho-receiver domain and a LytTR DNA-binding domain, BlpS is a 108-aa protein containing only a LytTR domain. Our results showed that the secreted peptide GSP activates the dedicated two-component system BlpH/BlpR to induce gallocin transcription. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis indicates that this regulatory system (GSP-BlpH/BlpR) is highly specific for bacteriocin production. Importantly, as opposed to BlpR, BlpS was shown to repress gallocin gene transcription. A conserved operator DNA sequence of 30-bp was found in all promoter regions regulated by BlpR and BlpS. EMSA assays showed direct and specific binding of the two gallocin regulators to various regulated promoter regions in a dose dependent manner. Gallocin expression appears tightly controlled in Sgg by quorum sensing and antagonistic activity of 2 LytTR-containing proteins.\n\nSignificanceStreptococcus gallolyticus (Sgg), formely known as S. bovis biotype I, is an opportunistic pathogen causing septicemia and endocarditis in the elderly often associated with asymptomatic colonic neoplasia. We previously showed that Sgg produces a bacteriocin, termed gallocin, enabling colonization of the colon in tumoral conditions by outcompeting commensal members of the gut. Here we characterized a 4-component regulatory system that regulates gallocin transcription, which is activated by the response regulator BlpR. BlpR itself is activated by a quorum sensing peptide GSP and a dedicated histidine kinase BlpH. Interestingly, BlpS, a small DNA-binding protein co-transcribed with BlpR was found to repress gallocin genes transcription, likely by antagonizing BlpR. Understanding gallocin regulation is crucial to prevent Sgg colon colonization in tumoral conditions.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates how DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) dysfunction causes genome instability. We showed that in DNMT3b deficient cells, R-loops contribute to prominent {gamma}H2AX signal, which was mapped to repetitive satellite sequences including centromere regions. By ChIP and DRIP analyses, our data revealed that centromeric R-loops in DNMT3b deficient cells are removed by XPG/XPF, thus generating DNA breaks in centromeres to increase mitotic aberration. In immunodeficiency-centromeric instability-facial anomalies (ICF) patient cells carrying the loss-of-function mutation at DNMT3b, knockdown of XPG/XPF in ICF cells also reduces DNA breaks in centromere while bringing up centromeric R-loop to the level similar to that in wild-type cells. These results suggest that DNMT3b has a critical function in preventing XPG/XPF-mediated cleavages at centromeric R-loop sites. Finally, we showed the involvement of non-homologous end-joining repair at centromeric sites in ICF cells. Thus, DNA cleavages at centromeric R-loops with error-prone repair undermine centromere stability in ICF cells.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus conveys various information associated with spatial navigation; yet, information distribution to multiple downstream areas remains unknown. We investigated this by identifying axonal projections using optogenetics during large-scale recordings from the rat subiculum, the major hippocampal output structure. Subicular neurons demonstrated a noise-resistant representation of place, speed, and trajectory, which was as accurate as that of hippocampal CA1 neurons. Speed and trajectory information was most prominently sent to the retrosplenial cortex and nucleus accumbens, respectively. Place information was distributed uniformly to the retrosplenial cortex, nucleus accumbens, anteroventral thalamus, and medial mammillary body. Information transmission by projection neurons was tightly controlled by theta oscillations and sharp-wave/ripples in a target region-specific manner. In conclusion, the subiculum robustly routes diverse navigation-associated information to downstream areas.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe subiculum accurately and robustly represents diverse information and routes it in a target region-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Fructose metabolism is increasingly recognized as a preferred energy source for cancer cell proliferation. However, it remains unclear why cancer cells favor fructose metabolism and how they acquire a sufficient amount of fructose. Here we report that cancer cells convert glucose into fructose through intra- and extracellular polyol pathways. The fructose metabolism bypasses normal aerobic respirations self-control to supply excessive metabolites to glycolysis and promotes the Warburg effect. Inhibition of fructose production drastically suppressed glycolysis and ATP production in cancer. Furthermore, we determined that a glucose transporter, SLC2A8/GLUT8, exports intracellular fructose to other cells in the tumor microenvironment. Taken together, our study suggests that the Warburg effect is achieved by means of fructose metabolism, instead of glucose metabolism alone.",

    "abstract": "Microbes transform aqueous mercury (Hg) into methylmercury (MeHg), a potent neurotoxin in terrestrial and marine food webs. This process requires the gene pair hgcAB, which encodes for proteins that actuate Hg methylation, and has been well described for anoxic environments. However, recent studies report potential MeHg formation in suboxic seawater, although the microorganisms involved remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted large-scale multi-omic analyses to search for putative microbial Hg methylators along defined redox gradients in Saanich Inlet (SI), British Columbia, a model natural ecosystem with previously measured Hg and MeHg concentration profiles. Analysis of gene expression profiles along the redoxcline identified several putative Hg methylating microbial groups, including Calditrichaeota, SAR324 and Marinimicrobia, with the last by far the most active based on hgc transcription levels. Marinimicrobia hgc genes were identified from multiple publicly available marine metagenomes, consistent with a potential key role in marine Hg methylation. Computational homology modelling predicted that Marinimicrobia HgcAB proteins contain the highly conserved structures required for functional Hg methylation. Furthermore, a number of terminal oxidases from aerobic respiratory chains were associated with several SI putative novel Hg methylators. Our findings thus reveal potential novel marine Hg-methylating microorganisms with a greater oxygen tolerance and broader habitat range than previously recognised.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLow birth weight (LBW) was a leading cause of neonatal mortality. It showed an increasing trend in Sub-Saharan Africa for the last one and half decade. Moreover, it was a public health problem in Ethiopia. Even though different studies were conducted to identify its predictors, contextual factors were insufficiently addressed in Ethiopia. There was also limited evidence on the spatial distribution of low birth weight. Therefore, this study aimed to explore spatial distribution and factors associated with low birth weight in Ethiopia.\n\nMethodSecondary data analysis was conducted using the 2016 EDHS data. A total of 1502 (weighted sample) mothers whose neonates were weighed at birth five years preceding the survey were included. GIS 10.1, SaTscan, stata, and Excel were used for data cleaning and analysis. A multi-level mixed-effects logistic regression model was fitted to identify factors associated with low birth weight. Finally, hotspot areas from GIS results, log-likelihood ratio (LLR) and relative risk with p-value of spatial scan statistics, AOR with 95% CI and random effects for mixed-effects logistic regression model were reported.\n\nResultsLow birth weight was spatially clustered in Ethiopia. Primary (LLR=11.57; P=0.002) clusters were detected in the Amhara region. Whereas secondary (LLR=11.4; P=0.003;LLR=10.14,P=0.0075) clusters were identified at Southwest Oromia, north Oromia, south Afar, and Southeast Amhara regions. Being severely anemic (AOR=1.47;95%CI1.04,2.01), having no education (AOR=1.82;95%CI1.12,2.96), Prematurity (AOR=5.91;95%CI3.21,10.10) female neonate (AOR=1.38;95%CI1.04,1.84)were significantly associated with LBW\n\nConclusionLBW was spatially clustered in Ethiopia with high-risk areas in Amhara,Oromia, and Afar regions and it was affected by socio demographic factors. Therefore, focusing the policy intervention in those geogrsphically low birth weight risk areas and improving maternal education and nutrtion could be vital to reduce the low birth weight disparity in Ethiopia.",
