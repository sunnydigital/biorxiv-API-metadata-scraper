    "abstract": "Cannabinoids are notorious and profound modulators of behavioral state. In the brain, endocannabinoids act via Type 1-cannabinoid receptors (CB1) to modulate synaptic transmission and mediate multiple forms of synaptic plasticity. CB1 knockout (CB1KO) mice display a range of behavioral phenotypes, in particular hypoactivity and various deficits in learning and memory, including cerebellumdependent delay eyeblink conditioning. Here we find that the apparent effects of CB1 deletion on cerebellar learning are not due to direct effects on CB1-dependent plasticity, but rather, arise as a secondary consequence of altered behavioral state. Hypoactivity of CB1KO mice accounts for their impaired eyeblink conditioning across both animals and trials. Moreover, learning in these mutants is rescued by walking on a motorized treadmill during training. Finally, cerebellar granule cell-specific CB1KOs exhibit normal eyeblink conditioning, and both global and granule cell-specific CB1KOs display normal cerebellum-dependent locomotor coordination and learning. These findings highlight the modulation of behavioral state as a powerful independent means through which individual genes contribute to complex behaviors.",

    "abstract": "AbstractPrecise tongue control is necessary for drinking, eating, and vocalizing1, 2. Yet because tongue movements are fast and difficult to resolve, neural control of lingual kinematics remains poorly understood. Here we combine kilohertz frame-rate imaging and a deep learning based neural network to resolve 3D tongue kinematics in mice drinking from a water spout. Successful licks required previously unobserved corrective submovements (CSMs) which, like online corrections during primate reaches3-10, occurred after the tongue missed unseen, distant, or displaced targets. Photoinhibition of anterolateral motor cortex (ALM) impaired online corrections, resulting in hypometric licks that missed the spout. ALM neural activity reflected upcoming, ongoing, and past CSMs, as well as errors in predicted spout contact. Though less than a tenth of a second in duration, a single mouse lick exhibits hallmarks of online motor control associated with a primate reach, including cortex-dependent corrections after misses.",

    "abstract": "Parallel evolution of ecotypes occurs when selection independently drives the evolution of similar traits across similar environments. The multiple origin of ecotypes is often inferred on the basis of a phylogeny which clusters populations according to geographic location and not by the environment they occupy. However, the use of phylogenies to infer parallel evolution in closely related populations is problematic because gene flow and incomplete lineage sorting can uncouple the genetic structure at neutral markers from the colonization history of populations. Here, we demonstrate multiple origins within ecotypes of an Australian wildflower, Senecio lautus. We observed strong genetic structure as well as phylogenetic clustering by geography and show that this is unlikely due to gene flow between parapatric ecotypes, which is surprisingly low. We further confirm this analytically by demonstrating that phylogenetic distortion due to gene flow often requires higher levels of migration than those observed in S. lautus. Our results imply that selection can repeatedly create similar phenotypes despite the perceived homogenizing effects of gene flow.",

    "abstract": "NUPR1 is a stress response protein overexpressed upon cell injury in virtually all organs including the exocrine pancreas. Despite NUPR1s well established role in the response to cell stress, the molecular and structural machineries triggered by NUPR1 activation remain largely unknown. In this study, we uncover an important role for NUPR1 in participating in the unfolded protein response pathway and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. Biochemical results, confirmed by ultrastructural morphological observation, revealed alterations in the UPR in acinar cells of germline-deleted NUPR1 murine models, consistent with the inability to restore general protein translation. Bioinformatical analysis of NUPR1 interacting partners showed significant enrichment in translation initiation factors, including eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2. Co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays both confirmed interaction between NUPR1 and eIF2 and its phosphorylated form (p-eIF2). Our. Moreover, our data also suggest loss of NUPR1 in cells results in maintained eIF2 phosphorylation and evaluation of nascent proteins by (peIF2), and click chemistry revealed that NUPR1-depleted PANC-1 cells displayed a slower post stress protein translational recovery compared to wild-type. Combined, this data proposes a novel role for NUPR1 in the integrated stress response pathway, at least partially through promoting efficient PERK-branch activity and resolution through a unique interaction with eIF2.\n\nSignificanceIn the pancreas, NUPR1 is required for a resolution of the ER stress response. During ER stress response, NUPR1 binds both eIF2 allowing for its dephosphorylation and restoration of new protein synthesis.\n\nHighlightsBiochemical analysis revealed a general reduction in the protein expression of downstream mediators of the unfolded protein response in the pancreas of mice lacking Nupr1. This finding suggests a novel role for NUPR1 in the UPR/ER stress response.\n\nUltrastructural analysis of pancreata revealed reduced morphological alterations in tunicamycin-treated Nupr1-/- mice compared to Nupr1+/+ mice consistent with a maintained block in general protein translation.\n\nCo-immunoprecipitation of tagged NUPR1 confirmed a novel interaction with eIF2. Depletion of NUPR1 prolonged phosphorylation of eIF2, suggesting it may be involved in attenuation of the PERK branch of the UPR.\n\nNUPR1-depleted PANC-1 cells displayed a slower recovery of protein translation following UPR activation",

    "abstract": "Salinity has a significant negative impact on production of rice. To cope with the increased soil salinity due to climate change, we need to develop salt tolerant rice varieties that can maintain their high yield. Rice landraces indigenous to coastal Bangladesh can be a great resource to study the genetic basis of salt adaptation. In this study, we implemented a QTL analysis framework on a reciprocal mapping population between a salt tolerant landrace Horkuch and a high yieldingrice variety IR29. Our aim was to detect genetic loci that contributes to the salt adaptive responses of the two different developmental stages of rice which are very sensitive to salinity stress. We identified 14 QTL for 9 traits and found that most are unique to the specific developmental stage. In addition, we detected a significant effect of the cytoplasmic genome on the QTL model for some traits such as leaf total potassium and filled grain weight. This underscores the importance of considering cytoplasm-nuclear interaction for breeding programs. Along with this, we identified QTL co-localization for multiple traits that highlights the possible constraint of multiple QTL selection for breeding programs due to different contributions of a donor allele for different traits.\n\nHighlightsWe identified genetic loci for the salt tolerance response of two different developmental stages of the rice plant and detected significant contribution of cytoplasm-nuclear genome interaction for a few traits.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFemale genital tract (FGT) inflammation is an important risk factor for HIV acquisition. The FGT microbiome is closely associated with inflammatory profile, however, the relative importance of microbial activities has not been established. Since proteins are key elements representing actual microbial functions, this study utilized metaproteomics to evaluate the relationship between FGT microbial function and inflammation in 113 young and adolescent South African women at high risk of HIV infection. Women were grouped as having low, medium or high FGT inflammation by K-means clustering according to pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations.\n\nResultsA total of 3,186 microbial and human proteins were identified in lateral vaginal wall swabs using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, while 94 microbial taxa were included in the taxonomic analysis. Both metaproteomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses showed increased non-optimal bacteria and decreased lactobacilli in women with FGT inflammatory profiles. However, differences in the predicted relative abundance of most bacteria were observed between 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metaproteomics analyses. Bacterial protein functional annotations (gene ontology) predicted inflammatory cytokine profiles more accurately than bacterial relative abundance determined by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, as well as functional predictions based on 16S rRNA gene sequence data (p<0.0001). The majority of microbial biological processes were underrepresented in women with high inflammation compared to those with low inflammation, including a Lactobacillus-associated signature of reduced cell wall organization and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. This signature remained associated with high FGT inflammation in a subset of 74 women nine weeks later, was upheld after adjusting for Lactobacillus relative abundance, and was associated with in vitro inflammatory cytokine responses to Lactobacillus isolates from the same women. Reduced cell wall organization and peptidoglycan biosynthesis were also associated with high FGT inflammation in an independent sample of ten women.\n\nConclusionsBoth the presence of specific microbial taxa in the FGT and their properties and activities are critical determinants of FGT inflammation. Our findings support those of previous studies suggesting that peptidoglycan is directly immunosuppressive, and identify a possible avenue for biotherapeutic development to reduce inflammation in the FGT. To facilitate further investigations of microbial activities, we have developed the FGT-METAP application that is available at (http://immunodb.org/FGTMetap/).",

    "abstract": "The role of calcium signaling during cytokinesis has long remained ambiguous. The studies of embryonic cell division discovered that calcium concentration increases transiently at the division plane just before the cleavage furrow ingression, leading to the hypothesis that these calcium transients trigger the contractile ring constriction. However, such calcium transients have only been found in animal embryos and their function remains controversial. Here we explored cytokinetic calcium transients in the model organism fission yeast. We adopted GCaMP, a genetically encoded calcium indicator, to determine the intracellular calcium level. We validated GCaMP as a highly sensitive calcium indicator which allowed us to capture the calcium transients stimulated by osmotic shocks. To identify calcium transients during cytokinesis, we first identified a correlation between the intracellular calcium level and cell division. Next, we discovered calcium spikes at the start of the cleavage furrow ingression and the end of the cell separation using time-lapse microscopy to. Inhibition of these calcium spikes slowed down the furrow ingression and led to frequent lysis of the daughter cells. We conclude that like the larger animal embryos fission yeast triggers cytokinetic calcium transients which promote the ring constriction and daughter cell integrity (194).\n\nHighlight summary for TOCCalcium rises transiently at the division plane during embryonic cell cytokinesis, but the conservation and function of such calcium transients remain unclear. We identified similar calcium spikes during fission yeast cytokinesis and demonstrated that these spikes promote the contractile ring constriction and the daughter cell integrity (257).",

Electrodermal activity (EDA) and Electromyography (EMG) were recorded simultaneously to indicate the arousal levels of participants. Results showed that both background speech and white noise significantly improved visual WM performance.

Specific EV surface proteins provide distinguishing characteristics, but are insufficient for more detailed classification of EVs. Here, we suggest a novel \"Bimolecular surface antigen expressed in EV\" (BiEV) as a potential indicator for more efficient EV screening. A BiEV can be identified using a previously developed method, enzyme-mediated activation of radical sources, to label the components proximal (within 20 nm) to a given molecule. We examined the screening of cancer cell-secreted EV (cEV) included in serum EVs from a model mouse for lung cancer. The cEV-specific BiEVs were first identified by through a comparison of serum EVs from wild-type and lung cancer mice, showing that the CHL1-SLC4A1 bimolecule was a significant candidate for cEV-specific BiEV. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay quantification of CHL1-SLC4A1 BiEV appeared to suggest a potential for cancer screening of these mice. Using the same protocols, we found that CHL1-caspase 14 BiEV was significantly elevated in lung cancer patients compared with healthy persons. A BiEV strategy may be able to make a contribution to more effective EV screening, resulting in novel biological and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Sea star wasting disease describes a condition affecting asteroids that resulted in significant Northeastern Pacific population decline following a mass mortality event in 2013. The etiology of sea star wasting is unresolved. We hypothesized that asteroid wasting is a sequela of microbial organic matter remineralization near respiratory surfaces which leads to boundary layer oxygen diffusion limitation (BLODL). Wasting lesions were induced in Pisaster ochraceus by enrichment with a variety of organic matter (OM) sources and by experimentally reduced oxygen conditions. Microbial assemblages inhabiting tissues and at the asteroid-water interface bore signatures of copiotroph proliferation before wasting onset, followed by the proliferation of putatively facultative and strictly anaerobic taxa. These results together illustrate that suboxic conditions at the animal-water interface may be established by heterotrophic bacterial activity in response to organic matter loading. Wasting susceptibility was significantly and positively correlated with rugosity, a key determinant of boundary layer thickness. At a semi-continuously monitored field site (Langley Harbor), wasting predictably occurred at annual peak or decline in phytoplankton biomass over 5 years, suggesting that primary production-derived OM may contribute to BLODL. Finally, wasting individuals from 2013 - 2014 bore stable isotopic signatures reflecting anaerobic processes which suggests that this phenomenon may have affected asteroids during mass mortality. The impacts of BLODL may be more pronounced under higher temperatures due to lower O2 solubility, in more rugose asteroid species due to restricted hydrodynamic flow, and in larger specimens due to their lower surface area to volume ratios which affects diffusive respiratory potential. Moreover, our results demonstrate that marine invertebrate disease may result from heterotrophic microbial activity that occurs adjacent to respiratory tissues, which raises important questions about the etiology of marine diseases in other benthic taxa.",

    "abstract": "The skin of vertebrates is the outermost organ of the body and serves as the first line of defense against external aggressions. In contrast to mammalian skin, that of teleost fish lacks keratinization and has evolved to operate as a mucosal surface containing a skin-associated lymphoid tissue (SALT). Thus far, IgT representing the prevalent immunoglobulin (Ig) in SALT have only been reported upon infection with a parasite. However, very little is known about the types of B cells and Igs responding to bacterial infection in the teleost skin mucosa, as well as the inductive or effector role of the SALT in such responses. To address these questions, here we analyzed the immune response of trout skin upon infection with one of the most widespread fish skin bacterial pathogens, Flavobacterium columnare. This pathogen induced strong skin innate immune and inflammatory responses at the initial phases of infection. More critically, we found that the skin mucus of fish having survived the infection contained significant IgT-but not IgM- or IgD-specific titers against the bacteria. Moreover, we demonstrate the local proliferation and production of IgT+ B-cells and specific IgT titers respectively within the SALT upon bacterial infection. Thus, our findings represent the first demonstration that IgT is the main Ig isotype induced by the skin mucosa upon bacterial infection, and that because of the large surface of the skin, its SALT probably represents a prominent IgT inductive site in fish.",

    "abstract": "The dysregulation of transcription factors is widely associated with tumorigenesis. As the most well-defined transcription factor in multiple types of cancer, c-Myc can directly transform cells by transactivating various downstream genes. Given that there is no effective way to directly inhibit c-Myc, c-Myc targeting strategies based on its regulatory mechanism hold great potential for cancer therapy. In this study, we found that WSB1, a direct target gene of c-Myc, can positively regulate c-Myc expression, which forms a feedforward circuit promoting cancer development. Luciferase-based promoter activity assays and RNA sequencing results confirmed that WSB1 promoted c-Myc expression through the {beta}-catenin pathway. Mechanistically, WSB1 affected {beta}-catenin destruction complex-PPP2CA assembly and E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor {beta}-TRCP recruitment, which inhibited the ubiquitination of {beta}-catenin and subsequently transactivated c-Myc. Of interest, the promoting effect of WSB1 on c-Myc was independent of its E3 ligase activity. Moreover, co-expression of WSB1 and c-Myc strongly enhanced the initiation and progression of tumours both in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our findings revealed a novel mechanism involved in tumorigenesis in which the WSB1/c-Myc feedforward circuit played an essential role, highlighting a potential c-Myc intervention strategy in cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about mechanisms of membrane fission in bacteria despite their requirement for cytokinesis. The only known dedicated membrane fission machinery in bacteria, FisB, is expressed during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis and is required to release the developing spore into the mother cell cytoplasm. Here we characterized the requirements for FisB-mediated membrane fission. FisB forms mobile clusters of [~]12 molecules that give way to an immobile cluster at the engulfment pole containing [~]40 proteins at the time of membrane fission. Analysis of FisB mutants revealed that binding to acidic lipids and homo-oligomerization are both critical for targeting FisB to the engulfment pole and membrane fission. Experiments using artificial membranes and filamentous cells suggest FisB does not have an intrinsic ability to sense or induce membrane curvature but can bridge membranes. Finally, modeling suggests homo-oligomerization and trans interactions with membranes are sufficient to explain FisB accumulation at the membrane neck that connects the engulfment membrane to the rest of the mother cell membrane during late stages of engulfment. Together, our results show that FisB is a robust and unusual membrane fission protein that relies on homo-oligomerization, lipid-binding and the unique membrane topology generated during engulfment for localization and membrane scission, but surprisingly, not on lipid microdomains, negative-curvature lipids, or curvature-sensing.",

    "abstract": "The ability to understand spoken language is essential for social, vocational, and emotional health, but can be disrupted by environmental noise, injury, or hearing loss. These auditory deficits can be ameliorated by visual speech signals that convey redundant or supplemental speech information, but the brain regions critically responsible for these audiovisual (AV) interactions remain poorly understood. Previous TMS and lesion-mapping studies suggest that the left posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) is causally implicated in producing the McGurk effect, an AV illusion in which auditory and visual speech are perceptually \"fused.\" However, previous research suggests that the McGurk effect is neurally and behaviorally dissociable from other visual effects on speech perception and, therefore, may not provide a generalizable index of AV interactions in speech perception more broadly. To examine whether the left pSTS is critically responsible for AV speech integration more broadly, we measured the strength of the McGurk effect, AV facilitation effects, and AV conflict effects longitudinally over 2 years in patients undergoing surgery for intrinsic tumors in the left pSTS (n = 2) or frontal lobes (control; n = 14). Results demonstrated that left pSTS lesions impaired experience of the McGurk effect, but did not uniformly reduce visual influences on speech perception. Additionally, when multisensory behaviors were affected by a lesion, AV speech perception abilities could recover over time. Our results suggest a causal dissociation between perceptual benefits produced by congruent AV speech and perceptual modulations produced by incongruent AV speech (the McGurk effect).These data are consistent with models proposing that that the pSTS is only one of multiple critical areas necessary for AV speech interactions.",

However, the molecular mechanisms involved in sensing mechanical stress during muscle formation remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role of the mechano-sensitive ion channel Piezo1 during myogenic progression. Direct manipulation of Piezo1 in muscle stem cells alters their myogenic progression. Indeed, Piezo1 knockdown suppresses myoblast fusion leading to smaller myotubes. Such event is accompanied by significant downregulation of the fusogenic protein Myomaker. In parallel, while Piezo1 knockdown also lowers Ca2+ influx in response to stretch, Piezo1 activation increases Ca2+ influx in response to stretch and enhances myoblasts fusion. We believe these findings may help understand molecular defects present in some muscle diseases. Altogether our study shows that Piezo1 is essential for terminal muscle differentiation acting on myoblast fusion, suggesting that Piezo1 deregulation may have implications in muscle aging and degenerative diseases including muscular dystrophies.",

    "abstract": "Acute ischemic stroke affects men and women differently in many ways. In particular, women are oftentimes reported to experience a higher acute stroke severity than men. Here, we derived a low-dimensional representation of anatomical stroke lesions and designed a sex-aware Bayesian hierarchical modelling framework for a large-scale, well phenotyped stroke cohort. This framework was tailored to carefully estimate possible sex differences in lesion patterns explaining acute stroke severity (NIHSS) in 1,058 patients (39% female). Anatomical regions known to subserve motor and language functions emerged as relevant regions for both men and women. Female patients, however, presented a more widespread pattern of stroke severity-relevant lesions than male patients. Furthermore, particularly lesions in the posterior circulation of the left hemisphere underlay a higher stroke severity exclusively in women. These sex-sensitive lesion pattern effects could be discovered and subsequently robustly replicated in two large independent, multisite lesion datasets. The constellation of findings has several important conceptual and clinical implications: 1) suggesting sex-specific functional cerebral asymmetries, and 2) motivating a sex-stratified approach to management of acute ischemic stroke. To go beyond sex-averaged stroke research, future studies should explicitly test whether acute therapies administered on the basis of sex-specific cutoff volumes of salvageable tissue will lead to improved outcomes in women after acute ischemic stroke.",

There is currently no approved vaccine to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and only very few treatment options are available to manage COVID-19 patients. For development of preclinical countermeasures, reliable and well-characterized small animal disease models will be of paramount importance. Here we show that intranasal inoculation of SARS-CoV-2 into Syrian hamsters consistently caused moderate broncho-interstitial pneumonia, with high viral lung loads and extensive virus shedding, but animals only displayed transient mild disease. We determined the infectious dose 50 to be only five infectious particles, making the Syrian hamster a highly susceptible model for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Neither hamster age nor sex had any impact on the severity of disease or course of infection. Finally, prolonged viral persistence in interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain knockout hamsters revealed susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 to adaptive immune control. In conclusion, the Syrian hamster is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 making it a very suitable infection model for COVID-19 countermeasure development.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe Syrian hamster is highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 making it an ideal infection model for COVID-19 countermeasure development.",

    "abstract": "The amygdala is one of the most widely connected structures in the primate brain and plays a key role in social and emotional behavior. Here, we present the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of whole-brain resting-state amygdala networks to discern whether connectivity in these networks could serve as an endophenotype for social behavior. Leveraging published resting-state amygdala networks as a priori endophenotypes in a GWAS meta-analysis of two adolescent cohorts, we identified a common polymorphism on chr.8p23.2 (rs10105357 A/G, MAF (G)=0.35) associated with stronger connectivity in the medial amygdala network (beta=0.20, p=2.97x10-8). This network contains regions that support reward processes and affiliative behavior. People carrying two copies of the minor allele for rs10105357 participate in more prosocial behaviors (t=2.644, p=0.008) and have higher CSMD1 expression in the temporal cortex (t=3.281, p=0.002) than people with one or no copy of the allele. In post-mortem brains across the lifespan, we found that CSMD1 expression is relatively high in the amygdala (2.79 fold higher than white matter, p=1.80x10-29), particularly so for nuclei in the medial amygdala, reaching a maximum in later stages of development. Amygdala network endophenotyping has the potential to accelerate genetic discovery in disorders of social function, such as autism, in which CSMD1 may serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis requires strict spatial and temporal organization to reproduce specific cell shapes. In the ovoid-shaped, pathogenic bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn), septal and peripheral (sidewall-like) PG synthesis occur simultaneously at midcell. To uncover the organization of proteins and activities that carry out these two modes of PG synthesis, we examined Spn cells vertically oriented onto their poles to image the division plane at the high lateral resolution of 3D-SIM (structured-illumination microscopy). Using fluorescent D-amino acid (FDAA) probes, we show that areas of new transpeptidase (TP) activity catalyzed by penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) separate into a pair of concentric rings early in division, representing peripheral PG (pPG) synthesis (outer ring) and the leading-edge (inner ring) of septal PG (sPG) synthesis. Fluorescently tagged PBP2x or FtsZ locate primarily to the inner FDAA-marked ring, whereas PBP2b and FtsX remain in the outer ring, suggesting roles in sPG or pPG synthesis, respectively. Short pulses of FDAA labeling revealed an arrangement of separate regularly spaced \"nodes\" of TP activity around the division site of predivisional cells. Control experiments in wild-type and mutant strains support the interpretation of nodal spacing of TP activity, and statistical analysis confirmed that the number of nodes correlates with different ring diameters. This nodal pattern of FDAA labeling is conserved in other ovoid-shaped species. Tagged PBP2x, PBP2b, and FtsX proteins also exhibited nodal patterns with spacing comparable to that of FDAA labeling. Together, these results reveal a highly ordered PG synthesis apparatus in ovococcal bacteria at different stages of division.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe spatial organization of PBPs and their TP activity at division septa is not well understood. In some bacteria, TP activity and PBP localization seem to be nodal (also called punctate), whereas in other bacteria, discrete foci of PBP activity are infrequently or not observed. Here we report two basic properties of the organization of PBPs and TP activity in the ovoid-shaped bacterium Spn. First, there is distinct spatial separation of the sPG machine, including FtsZ, from the pPG synthesis machine at the midcell of dividing Spn cells. Second, in predivisional cells, PBPs and TP activity are organized heterogeneously into regularly spaced nodes, whose number and dynamic distribution are likely driven by the PG synthesis of PBP:SEDS complexes.",

    "abstract": "Most adults experience episodes of gingivitis, which can progress to the irreversible, chronic state of periodontitis. However the mechanistic roles of plaque in gingivitis onset and progression to periodontitis remain elusive. Here, we integrated the longitudinal multi-omics data from plaque metagenome, metabolome and salivary cytokines in 40 adults who transit from naturally-occurring gingivitis (NG), to healthy gingivae (baseline) and then to experimental gingivitis (EG). During EG, rapid and consistent alterations in plaque microbiota, metabolites and salivary cytokines emerged as early as 24-72 hours after pause of oral hygiene, defining an asymptomatic  sub-optimal health (SoH) stage. SoH also features a steep and synergetic decrease of plaque-derived betaine and Rothia spp., suggesting an anti-gum-inflammation mechanism by health-promoting microbial residents. Global, cross-cohort meta-analysis revealed a high Microbiome-based Periodontitis Index at SoH state, due to its convergent taxonomical and functional profiles towards those of periodontitis. In contrast, caries SoH features a microbial signature very distinct from caries. Thus SoH is a universal state of polymicrobial inflammations with disease-specific features, which is key to maintaining a disease-preventive plaque.",

    "abstract": "Bile acids are detergent molecules that solubilize dietary lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins. Humans synthesize bile acids with -orientation hydroxyl groups which can be biotransformed by gut microbiota to toxic, hydrophobic bile acids, such as deoxycholic acid (DCA). Gut microbiota can also convert hydroxyl groups from the -orientation through an oxo-intermediate to the {beta}-orientation, resulting in more hydrophilic, less toxic bile acids. This interconversion is catalyzed by regio-(C-3 vs. C-7) and stereospecific ( vs. {beta}) hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDHs). So far, genes encoding the urso-(7-HSDH & 7{beta}-HSDH) and iso-(3-HSDH & 3{beta}-HSDH) bile acid pathways have been described. Recently, multiple human gut clostridia were reported to encode 12-HSDH, which interconverts DCA and 12-oxolithocholic acid (12-oxoLCA). 12{beta}-HSDH completes the epi-bile acid pathway by converting 12-oxoLCA to the 12{beta}-bile acid denoted epiDCA; however, gene(s) encoding this enzyme have yet to be identified. We confirmed 12{beta}-HSDH activity in cultures of Clostridium paraputrificum ATCC 25780. From six candidate C. paraputrificum ATCC 25780 oxidoreductase genes, we discovered the first gene (DR024_RS09610) encoding bile acid 12{beta}-HSDH. Phylogenetic analysis revealed unforeseen diversity for 12{beta}-HSDH, leading to validation of two additional bile acid 12{beta}-HSDHs through a synthetic biology approach. By comparison to a previous phylogenetic analysis of 12-HSDH, we identified the first potential C-12 epimerizing strains: Collinsella tanakaei YIT 12063 and Collinsella stercoris DSM 13279. A Hidden Markov Model search against human gut metagenomes located putative 12{beta}-HSDH genes in about 30% of subjects within the cohorts analyzed, indicating this gene is relevant in the human gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Cell migration is important during early animal embryogenesis. Cell migration and cell shape are controlled by actin assembly and dynamics, which depend on capping proteins, including the barbed-end heterodimeric actin capping protein (CP). CP activity can be regulated by capping-protein-interacting (CPI) motif proteins, including CARMIL (capping protein Arp2/3 myosin-I linker) family proteins. Previous studies of CARMIL3, one of the three highly conserved CARMIL genes in vertebrates, have largely been limited to cells in culture. Towards understanding CARMIL function during embryogenesis in vivo, we analyzed zebrafish lines carrying mutations of carmil3. Maternal-zygotic mutants show impaired endodermal migration during gastrulation, along with defects in dorsal forerunner cell (DFC) cluster formation, affecting the morphogenesis of Kupffers vesicle (KV). Mutant KVs are smaller and display decreased numbers of cilia, leading to defects in left/right (L/R) patterning with variable penetrance and expressivity. The penetrance and expressivity of the KV phenotype in carmil3 mutants correlated well with the L/R heart positioning defect at the end of embryogenesis. This first in vivo animal study of CARMIL3 reveals its new role for CARMIL3 during morphogenesis of the vertebrate embryo. This role involves migration of endodermal cells and DFCs, along with subsequent morphogenesis of the KV and L/R asymmetry.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic divergence-time estimation has been revolutionized by two recent developments: 1) total-evidence dating (or \"tip-dating\") approaches that allow for the incorporation of fossils as tips in the analysis, with their phylogenetic and temporal relationships to the extant taxa inferred from the data, and 2) the fossilized birth-death (FBD) class of tree models that capture the processes that produce the tree (speciation, extinction, and fossilization), and thus provide a coherent and biologically interpretable tree prior. To explore the behaviour of these methods, we apply them to marattialean ferns, a group that was dominant in Carboniferous landscapes prior to declining to its modest extant diversity of slightly over 100 species. We show that tree models have a dramatic influence on estimates of both divergence times and topological relationships. This influence is driven by the strong, counter-intuitive informativeness of the uniform tree prior and the inherent nonidentifiability of divergence-time models. In contrast to the strong influence of the tree models, we find minor effects of differing the morphological transition model or the morphological clock model. We compare the performance of a large pool of candidate models using a combination of posterior-predictive simulation and Bayes factors. Notably, an FBD model with epoch-specific speciation and extinction rates was strongly favored by Bayes factors. Our best-fitting model infers stem and crown divergences for the Marattiales in the mid-Devonian and Late Cretaceous, respectively, with elevated speciation rates in the Mississippian and elevated extinction rates in the Cisuralian leading to a peak diversity of [~]2800 species at the end of the Carboniferous, representing the heyday of the Psaroniaceae. This peak is followed by the rapid decline and ultimate extinction of the Psaroniaceae, with their descendants, the Marattiaceae, persisting at approximately stable levels of diversity until the present. This general diversification pattern appears to be insensitive to potential biases in the fossil record; despite the preponderance of available fossils being from Pennsylvanian coal balls, incorporating fossilization-rate variation does not improve model fit. In addition, by incorporating temporal data directly within the model and allowing for the inference of the phylogenetic position of the fossils, our study makes the surprising inference that the clade of extant Marattiales is relatively young, younger than any of the fossils historically thought to be congeneric with extant species. This result is a dramatic demonstration of the dangers of node-based approaches to divergence-time estimation, where the assignment of fossils to particular clades are made a priori (earlier node-based studies that constrained the minimum ages of extant genera based on these fossils resulted in much older age estimates than in our study) and of the utility of explicit models of morphological evolution and lineage diversification.",

    "abstract": "Breeding for late blight resistance has traditionally relied on phenotypic selection, but as the number of characterized resistance (R) genes has grown, so have the possibilities for genotypic selection. One challenge for breeding russet varieties is the lack of information about the genetic basis of resistance in this germplasm group. Based on observations of strong resistance by  Payette Russet to genotype US-23 of the late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans in inoculated experiments, we deduced the variety must contain at least one major R gene. To identify the gene(s), 79 F1 progeny were screened using a detached leaf assay and classified as resistant vs. susceptible. Linkage mapping using markers from the potato SNP array revealed a single resistant haplotype on the short arm of chromosome group 4, which coincides with the R2/Rpi-abpt/Rpi-blb3 locus. PCR amplification and sequencing of the gene in Payette revealed it is homologous to R2, and transient expression experiments in Nicotiana benthamiana confirmed its recognition of the Avr2 effector. Sequencing of a small diversity panel revealed a SNP unique to resistant haplotypes at the R2 locus, which was converted to a KASP marker that showed perfect prediction accuracy in the F1 population and diversity panel. Although many genotypes of P. infestans are virulent against R2, even when defeated this gene may be valuable as one component of a multi-genic approach to quantitative resistance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA large portion of nuclear DNA is composed of transposable element (TE) sequences, whose transposition is controlled by diverse host defense strategies in order to maintain genomic integrity. One such strategy is the fungal-specific Repeat-Induced Point (RIP) mutation that hyper-mutates repetitive DNA sequences. While RIP is found across Fungi, it has been shown to vary in efficiency. To date, detailed information on the TE landscapes and associated RIP patterns exist only in a few species belonging to highly divergent lineages.\n\nResultWe investigated 18 nearly gapless genome assemblies of ten Neurospora species, which diverged from a common ancestor about 7 MYA, to determine genome-wide TE distribution and their associated RIP patterns. We showed that the TE contents between 8.7-18.9% covary with genome sizes that range between 37.8-43.9 Mb. Degraded copies of Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were abundant among the identified TEs, and these are distributed across the genome at varying frequencies. In all investigated genomes, TE sequences had signs of numerous C-to-T substitutions, suggesting that RIP occurred in all species. RIP signatures in all genomes correlated with TE-dense regions.\n\nConclusionsEssentially gapless genome assemblies allowed us to identify TEs in Neurospora genomes, and reveal that TEs contribute to genome size variation in this group. Our study suggests that TEs and RIP are highly correlated in Neurospora, and hence, the pattern of interaction is conserved over the investigated evolutionary timescale. We show that RIP signatures can be used to facilitate the identification of TE-rich region in the genome.",

The purpose of our present research is to evaluate whether the activity of the Vitamin A ester retinyl propionate (RP) can be enhanced by niacinamide (Nam) and a flavonoid containing Ceratonia siliqua (CS) fruit extract in retinoid responsive in vitro models.\n\nMETHODSRP was tested alone and in combination with Nam and CS in an RAR reporter cell line for promoter activation and compared to trans-retinoic acid (tRA) activation. These treatments were also tested in keratinocytes for gene expression profiling by qPCR using a panel of 40 retinoid responsive genes.\n\nRESULTStRA or RP elicited RAR reporter activation in a dose dependent manner. The combination of 0.5 M or 2 M RP with 10 mM Nam had a 56% and 95% signal increase compared to RP, respectively. The addition of 1% CS to 0.5 M or 2 M RP with 10 mM Nam elicited a further increase of 114% and 156%, respectively, over RP and Nam combinations. All retinoids elicited an increase in expression of 40 retinoid sensitive genes over control levels. Of the 40 genes 27 were enhanced by either 0.5 M RP or 2 M RP with 10 mM Nam and 1% CS. Nam or CS had very modest activity in both models.\n\nCONCLUSIONThe combination of RP with Nam and CS showed a higher retinoid response than RP in two separate retinoid responsive in vitro models. We hypothesize Nam and CS enhances RP activity by modulating metabolism to tRA via increasing NAD+ pools and inhibiting reduction of retinal (RAL) back to retinol, respectively. The findings provide evidence that this combination may have enhanced efficacy for treating the appearance of photoaged skin.",

The model biflagellate Chlamydomonas reinhardtii rotates at a constant 1 - 2 Hz as it swims, but the mechanism is unclear. Here, we show unequivocally that the rolling motion derives from a persistent, non-planar flagellar beat pattern. This is revealed by high-speed imaging and micromanipulation of live cells. We construct a fully-3D model to relate flagellar beating directly to the free-swimming trajectories. For realistic geometries, the model reproduces both the sense and magnitude of the axial rotation of live cells. We show that helical swimming requires further symmetry-breaking between the two flagella. These functional differences underlie all tactic responses, particularly phototaxis.

Prion-like proteins (PrLPs) have been demonstrated to be present in plants, but their role in plant stress and memory remains largely unexplored. In this work, we report the widespread presence of PrLPs in plants through a comprehensive analysis of 39 genomes representing major taxonomic groups. We find diverse functional roles associated with plant  prionomes. Investigation of the rice transcriptome further delineated the role of PrLPs in stress and developmental responses, leading us to explore whether and to what extent PrLPs may build stress memory. The rice prionome is significantly enriched for Transposons/Retrotransposons (Ts/RTRs), and we derived transcriptional regulatory inferences from diurnal gene expression revealing a complex regulatory network between PrLPs, transcription factors and genes known to be involved in stress priming, as well as transient and trans-generational plant memory. Overall, our data suggest that plant memory mechanisms may rely upon protein-based signals embedded in PrLPs, in addition to chromatin-based epigenetic signals and provides important insights into the anticipated role of prions in stress and memory.",

    "abstract": "Optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs) offer the potential for a step change in magnetoencephalography (MEG) enabling wearable systems that: provide improved data quality; accommodate any subject group; allow data capture during movement and offer a reduction in costs. However, OPM-MEG is still a nascent technology and, to realise its potential, it must be shown to facilitate key neuroscientific measurements, such as the characterisation of human brain networks. Networks, and the connectivities that underlie them, have become a core area of neuroscientific investigation, and their importance is underscored by many demonstrations of their perturbation in brain disorders. Consequently, a demonstration of network measurements via OPM-MEG would be a significant step forward. Here, we aimed to show that a wearable 50-channel OPM-MEG system enables characterisation of the electrophysiological connectome. To this end, we characterise connectivity in the resting state and during a simple visuo-motor task, using both OPM-MEG and a state-of-the-art 275-channel cryogenic MEG device. Our results show that connectome matrices from OPM and cryogenic systems exhibit an extremely high degree of similarity, with correlation values >70 %. This value is not measurably different to the correlation observed between connectomes measured in different subject groups, on a single scanner. In addition, similar differences in connectivity between individuals (scanned multiple times) were observed in cryogenic and OPM-MEG data, again demonstrating the fidelity of OPM-MEG data. This demonstration shows that a nascent OPM-MEG system offers results similar to a cryogenic device, even despite having [~]5 times fewer sensors. This adds weight to the argument that OPMs will ultimately supersede cryogenic sensors for MEG measurement.",

    "abstract": "Overlapping neurophysiological signals are the main obstacle preventing from using cortical event-related potentials (ERPs) in clinical settings. Children ERPs are particularly affected by this problem, as their cerebral cortex is still maturing. To overcome this problem, we applied a new version of Spike-density Component Analysis (SCA), an analysis method recently introduced, to isolate with high accuracy the neural components of auditory ERP responses (AEPs) in 8-year-old children. Electroencephalography was used with 33 children to record AEPs to auditory stimuli varying in spectrotemporal features. Three different analysis approaches were adopted: the standard ERP analysis procedure, SCA with template-match (SCA-TM), and SCA with half-split average consistency (SCA-HSAC). SCA-HSAC most successfully allowed the extraction of AEPs for each child, revealing that the most consistent components were P1 and N2. An immature N1 component was also detected.\n\nSuperior accuracy in isolating neural components at the individual level even in children was demonstrated for SCA-HSAC over other SCA approaches. Reliable methods of extraction of neurophysiological signals at the individual level are crucial for the application of cortical AEPs for routine diagnostic exams in clinical settings both in children and adults.\n\nHighlightsO_LISpike-density component analysis (SCA) was validated on children ERPs\nC_LIO_LISCA extracted overlapping neural components from auditory ERPs (AEPs)\nC_LIO_LIChild AEPs were modelled at the individual level\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is a developmental period that dramatically impacts body and behavior, with pubertal hormones playing an important role not only in the morphological changes in the body but also in brain structure and function. Understanding brain development during adolescence has become a priority in neuroscience because it coincides with the onset of many psychiatric and behavioral disorders. However, little is known about how puberty influences the brain functional connectome. In this study, taking a longitudinal human sample of typically developing children and adolescents (of both sexes), we demonstrate that the development of the brain functional connectome better fits pubertal status than chronological age. In particular, centrality, segregation, efficiency, and integration of the brain functional connectome increase after the onset of the pubertal markers. We found that these effects are stronger in attention and task control networks. Lastly, after controlling for this effect, we showed that functional connectivity between these networks is related to better performance in cognitive flexibility. This study points out the importance of considering longitudinal nonlinear trends when exploring developmental trajectories, and emphasizes the impact of puberty on the functional organization of the brain in adolescence.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the brain organization along development is a crucial challenge for Neuroscience. In particular, during adolescence there is a great impact in body and cognitive functions as well as substantial incidence of mental health disruptions. Here, we tested how brain organization changes along this period based on the properties of the functional connectome in a longitudinal pediatric sample. We found a nonlinear increase in the connectivity and the brain network efficiency, particularly after the onset of puberty. These effects were more prominent in association networks. In addition, higher connectivity in those areas was associated with better performance in cognitive flexibility. These results demonstrate the importance of considering pubertal assessment as well as nonlinear trends in developmental studies.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) is among the most widely diffused, inexpensive, and applied neuroimaging techniques. Nonetheless, EEG requires measurements against a reference site(s), which is typically chosen by the experimenter, and specific pre-processing steps precede analysis. It is therefore valuable to obtain quantities that are reference-independent and minimally affected by pre-processing choices. Here, we show that the topological structure of embedding spaces, constructed either from multi-channel EEG timeseries or from their temporal structure, are subject-specific and robust to re-referencing and pre-processing pipelines. By contrast, the shape of correlation spaces, that is, discrete spaces where each point represents an electrode and the distance between them that is in turn related to the correlation between the respective timeseries, were neither significantly subject-specific nor robust to changes of reference. Our results suggest that the shape of spaces describing the observed configurations of EEG signals holds information about the individual specificity of the underlying individuals brain dynamics, and that temporal correlations constrain to a large degree the set of possible dynamics. In turn, these encode the differences between subjects space of resting state EEG signals. Finally, our results and proposed methodology provide tools to explore the individual topographical landscapes and how they are explored dynamically. We propose therefore to augment conventional topographic analyses with an additional - topological - level of analysis, and to consider them jointly. More generally, these results provide a roadmap for the incorporation of topological analyses within EEG pipelines.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental problem in neuroscience is how memories are maintained from days to a lifetime, given turnover of proteins that underlie expression of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) or  tag synapses as eligible for LTP. One likely solution relies on synaptic positive feedback loops, prominently including persistent activation of Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and self-activated synthesis of protein kinase M {zeta} (PKM{zeta}). Recent studies also suggest positive feedback based on recurrent synaptic reactivation within neuron assemblies, or engrams, is necessary to maintain memories. The relative importance of these feedback mechanisms is controversial. To explore the likelihood that each mechanism is necessary or sufficient to maintain memory, we simulated maintenance of LTP with a simplified model incorporating persistent kinase activation, synaptic tagging, and preferential reactivation of strong synapses, and analyzed implications of recent data. We simulated three model variants, each maintaining LTP with one feedback loop: autonomous, self-activated PKM{zeta} synthesis (model variant I); self-activated CamKII (model variant II); and recurrent reactivation of strengthened synapses (model variant III). Variant I requires and predicts that, for successful maintenance, PKM{zeta} must contribute to synaptic tagging. Variant II maintains LTP and suggests persistent CaMKII activation could maintain PKM{zeta} activity, a feedforward interaction not previously considered. However we note data challenging this feedback loop. In Variant III synaptic reactivation drives, and thus predicts, recurrent or persistent activity elevations of CamKII and other necessary kinases, plausibly contributing to empirically persistent elevation of PKM{zeta} levels. Reactivation is thus predicted to sustain recurrent rounds of synaptic tagging and incorporation of plasticity-related proteins. We also suggest (model variant IV) that synaptic reactivation and autonomous kinase activation could synergistically maintain LTP. We propose experiments that could discriminate these maintenance mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Gliomas are heavily infiltrated with immune cells of myeloid origin. Past studies have shown that high-grade gliomas have a higher proportion of alternatively activated and suppressive myeloid cells when compared to low-grade gliomas, which correlate with poor prognosis. However, the differences in immune cell phenotypes within high-grade gliomas (between grade III and IV) are relatively less explored, and a correlation of phenotypic characteristics between immune cells in the blood and high grade tumors has not been performed. Additionally, myeloid cells of granulocytic origin present in gliomas remain poorly characterized. Herein, we address these questions through phenotypic characterizations of monocytes and neutrophils present in blood and tumors of individuals with glioblastoma (GBM, grade IV) or grade III gliomas. Our data show that CD163 expressing M2 monocytes are present in greater proportions in GBM tissue when compared to grade III glioma tissue. In addition, we observe that neutrophils are highly heterogeneous among individuals with glioma, and a greater proportion of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells are present in grade III gliomas when compared to GBM. Finally, we show that the expression levels of CD86 and CD63 showed a high correlation between blood and tumor, and suggest that these may be used as possible markers for prognosis.",

We also establish that this is a general transcriptional regulatory mechanism for [~]6% of genes expressed with FPKM>1 in primary human airway epithelial cells. We observed that a homeostatic mechanism maintains promoter, but not enhancer H3K18/27ac in response to extensive inhibition of CBP/p300 acetyl transferase activity by the highly specific small molecule inhibitor A-485. Further, our results suggest a function for BRD4 association at enhancers in regulating paused Pol2 release at nearby promoters. Taken together, our results uncover processes regulating transcriptional elongation by promoter region histone H3 acetylation and homeostatic maintenance of promoter, but not enhancer, H3K18/27ac in response to inhibition of CBP/p300 acetyl transferase activity.",

    "abstract": "Three dimensional (3D) collective cell migration (CCM) is critical for improving liver cell therapies, eliciting mechanisms of liver disease, and modeling human liver development/ organogenesis. Here, we modeled liver organogenesis to induce 3D CCM and improve existing models. The liver diverticulum, normally surrounded by septum transversum mesenchyme (STM) at E8.5, was modeled with a miniature liver spheroid surrounded by mesenchymal cells and matrix. In mixed spheroid models with both liver and uniquely MRC5 (fetal lung) fibroblasts, we observed co-migration of cells, and a significant increase in length and number of liver spheroid protrusions, and this was highly sensitive to TGFB1 stimulation. To understand paracrine effects between MRC-5 cells and liver, we performed conditioned medium (M-CM) experiments. Interestingly, the addition of M-CM increased liver 3D CCM, with thin, 3D, dose-dependent branching morphogenesis, an upregulation of Twist1, and a sensitivity to a broad TGFB inhibitor. To test the effects of cell-cell interactions of 3D CCM, the STM was modeled with a spheroid of MRC-5 cells, and we performed co-spheroid culture of liver with MRC-5. We observed a complex morphogenesis, whereby thin, linear, 3D liver cell strands attach to the MRC-5 spheroid, anchor, and thicken to form permanent and thick anchoring contacts between the two spheroids. We also observed spheroid fusion, a form of interstitial migration. In conclusion, we present several novel cultivation systems that induce distinct features of 3D CCM, as judged by the presence of branching, linearity, thickness, and interstitial migration. These methodologies will greatly improve our molecular, cellular, and tissue-scale understanding of liver organogenesis, liver diseases, and liver cell therapy, and will serve as a tool to bridge conventional 2D studies and preclinical in vivo studies.",

Current and future predictions of change in geographic distribution are frequently included in species distribution models (SDMs). The potential spatial distributions of the fruit fly Anastrepha striata Schiner (the main species of agricultural importance in guava crops) under current and possible future scenarios in Colombia were modeled, and the establishment risk was assessed for each guava-producing municipality in the country. The SDMs were developed using 221 geographical records in conjunctuin with nine scenopoetic variables. The model for current climate conditions indicated an extensive suitable area for the establishment of A. striata in the Andean region, smaller areas in the Caribbean and Pacific, and almost no areas in the Orinoquia and Amazonian regions. A brief discussion regarding the area suitability for the fly is offered. The expansion of the suitable area was observed in all future scenarios; moreover, this effect was more pronounced in the Amazonian region. The Colombian guava-producing municipalities were classified according to the degree of vulnerability to the fly establishment as follows: 42 were high-risk, 16 were intermediate-risk, and 17 were low-risk. The implementation of future integrated management plans must include optimal spatial data and must consider environmental aspects, such as those suggested by the models presented here.

    "abstract": "Adaptation to novel environments often involves the evolution of multiple morphological, physiological and behavioral traits. One striking example of multi-trait evolution is the suite of traits that has evolved repeatedly in cave animals, including regression of eyes, loss of pigmentation, and enhancement of non-visual sensory systems [1,3]. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, consists of fish that inhabit at least 30 caves in Northeast Mexico and ancestral-like surface fish which inhabit the rivers of Mexico and Southern Texas [6]. Cave A. mexicanus are interfertile with surface fish and have evolved a number of traits that are common to cave animals throughout the world, including albinism, eye loss, and alterations to behavior [8-10]. To define relationships between different cave-evolved traits, we phenotyped 208 surface-cave F2 hybrid fish for numerous morphological and behavioral traits. We found significant differences in sleep between pigmented and albino hybrid fish, raising the possibility that these traits share a genetic basis. In cavefish and many other species, mutations in oculocutaneous albinism 2 (oca2) cause albinism [11-15]. Surface fish with CRISPR-induced mutations in oca2 displayed both albinism and reduced sleep. Further, this mutation in oca2 fails to complement sleep loss when surface fish harboring this engineered mutation are crossed to different, independently evolved populations of albino cavefish with naturally occurring mutations in oca2, confirming that oca2 contributes to sleep loss. Finally, analysis of the oca2 locus in wild caught cave and surface fish suggests that oca2 is under positive selection in at least three cave populations. Taken together, these findings identify oca2 as a novel regulator of sleep and suggest that a pleiotropic function of oca2 underlies the adaptive evolution of both of albinism and sleep loss.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that urbanization shapes the ecology and evolution of species interactions. Islands are particularly susceptible to urbanization due to the fragility of their ecosystems; however, few studies have examined the effects of urbanization on species interactions on islands. To address this gap, we studied the effects of urbanization on interactions between Darwins finches and its key food resource, Tribulus cistoides, in three towns on the Galapagos Islands. We assessed the effects of urbanization on seed and mericarp removal, mericarp morphology, and finch community composition using natural population surveys, experimental manipulations, and finch observations. We found that both seed and fruit removal rates were higher in urban compared to non-urban populations in the natural and experimental populations, and that urbanization modified selection on mericarp size and defense. Urban environments supported smaller and less diverse finch communities than non-urban environments. Together, our results suggest that urbanization can dramatically alter ecological interactions between Darwins finches and T. cistoides, leading to modified selection on T. cistoides populations.

    "abstract": "APOBEC3A (A3A) and APOBEC3B (A3B) enzymes drive APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis, but the understanding of the regulation of their mutagenic activity remains limited. Here, we showed that mutagenic and non-mutagenic A3A and A3B enzymes are produced by canonical and alternatively spliced A3A and A3B isoforms, respectively. Notably, increased expression of the canonical A3B isoform, which encodes the mutagenic A3B enzyme, predicted shorter progression-free survival of bladder cancer patients. Expression of the mutagenic A3B isoform was reduced by exon 5 skipping, generating a non-mutagenic A3B isoform. The exon 5 skipping, which was dependent on the interaction between SF3B1 splicing factor and weak branch point sites in intron 4, could be enhanced by an SF3B1 inhibitor, decreasing the production of the mutagenic A3B enzyme. Thus, our results underscore the role of A3B, especially in bladder cancer, and implicate alternative splicing of A3B as a mechanism and therapeutic target to restrict APOBEC-mediated mutagenesis.",

    "abstract": "Viruses of prokaryotes are extremely abundant and diverse. Culture-independent approaches have recently shed light on the biodiversity these biological entities1,2. One fundamental question when trying to understand their ecological roles is: which host do they infect? To tackle this issue we developed a machine-learning approach named Random Forest Assignment of Hosts (RaFAH), based on the analysis of nearly 200,000 viral genomes. RaFAH outperformed other methods for virus-host prediction (F1-score = 0.97 at the level of phylum). RaFAH was applied to diverse datasets encompassing genomes of uncultured viruses derived from eight different biomes of medical, biotechnological, and environmental relevance, and was capable of accurately describing these viromes. This led to the discovery of 537 genomic sequences of archaeal viruses. These viruses represent previously unknown lineages and their genomes encode novel auxiliary metabolic genes, which shed light on how these viruses interfere with the host molecular machinery. RaFAH is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/rafah/.",

    "abstract": "Cellular genetic heterogeneity is common in many biological conditions including cancer, microbiome, co-infection of multiple pathogens. Detecting and phasing minor variants, which is to determine whether multiple variants are from the same haplotype, play an instrumental role in deciphering cellular genetic heterogeneity, but are still difficult because of technological limitations. Recently, long-read sequencing technologies, including those by Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, have provided an unprecedented opportunity to tackle these challenges. However, high error rates make it difficult to take full advantage of these technologies. To fill this gap, we introduce iGDA, an open-source tool that can accurately detect and phase minor single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), whose frequencies are as low as 0.2%, from raw long-read sequencing data. We also demonstrated that iGDA can accurately reconstruct haplotypes in closely-related strains of the same species (divergence[&ge;] 0.011%) from long-read metagenomic data. Our approach, therefore, presents a significant advance towards the complete deciphering of cellular genetic heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Wood formation is a crucial process for carbon sequestration, yet how variations in carbon supply affect wood formation and carbon dynamics in trees more generally remains poorly understood.\n\nTo better understand the role of carbon supply in wood formation, we restricted phloem transport using girdling and compression around the stem of mature white pines and monitored the effects on local wood formation and stem CO2 efflux, as well as nonstructural carbon concentrations in needles, stems, and roots.\n\nGrowth and stem CO2 efflux varied with location relative to treatment (i.e., above or below on the stem). We observed up to a two-fold difference in the number of tracheids formed above versus below the manipulations over the remaining growing season. In contrast, the treatments did not affect mean cell size noticeably and mean cell-wall area decreased only slightly below them. Surprisingly, nonstructural carbon pools and concentrations in the xylem, needles, and roots remained largely unchanged, although starch reserves declined and increased marginally below and above the girdle, respectively.\n\nOur results suggest that phloem transport strongly affects cell proliferation and respiration in the cambial zone of mature white pine, but has little impact on nonstructural carbon concentrations. These findings contribute to our understanding of how wood formation is controlled.\n\nHighlightRestrictions in phloem transport designed to affect carbon supply, lead to changes in wood formation and stem respiration of mature white pines without substantially changing local nonstructural carbon concentrations.",

    "abstract": "While it is well known that all organisms age, our understanding of how aging occurs varies dramatically among species. The aging process in perennial plants is not well defined, yet can have implications on production and yield of valuable fruit and nut crops. Almond, a relevant nut crop, exhibits an age-related disorder known as non-infectious bud failure (BF) that affects vegetative bud development, indirectly affecting kernel-yield. This species and disorder present an opportunity to address aging in a commercially-relevant and vegetatively-propagated, perennial crop threatened by an aging-related disorder. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that telomere length and/or TERT expression can serve as biomarkers of aging in almond using both whole-genome sequencing data and leaf samples collected from distinct age cohorts over a two-year period. To measure telomere lengths, we employed both in silico and molecular approaches. We also measured expression of TERT, a subunit of the enzyme telomerase, which is responsible for maintaining telomere lengths. Results from this work show a marginal but significant association between both telomere length measured by monochrome multiplex quantitative PCR and TERT expression, and age of almond seedlings. These results suggest that as almonds age, TERT expression decreases and telomeres shorten. This work provides valuable information on potential biomarkers of perennial plant aging, contributing to our limited knowledge of this process. In addition, translation of this information will provide opportunities to address BF in almond breeding and nursery propagation.",

    "abstract": "Living systems formed and evolved under governing constraints that characterize their interactions with the inorganic world. These interactions are definable using basic physico-chemical principles. Here, we formulate a comprehensive set of ten governing abiotic constraints that define possible quantitative metabolomes. We apply these constraints to a metabolic network of Escherichia coli that represents 90% of its metabolome. We show that the quantitative metabolomes allowed by the abiotic constraints are consistent with metabolomic and isotope labeling data. We find that: (i) Network-wide characterization of charge-, proton- and magnesium-related constraints shape transcriptional regulatory responses to osmotic stress; (ii) Proton and charge imbalance underlie transcriptional regulatory responses to acid stress; (iii) Abiotic constraints drive the evolution of transport systems, such as high-affinity phosphate transporters. Thus, quantifying the constraints that the inorganic world imposes on living systems provides insights into their key characteristics, helps understand the outcomes of evolutionary adaptation, and should be considered as a fundamental part of theoretical biology and for understanding the constraints on evolution.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that transcription factor B1 mitochondrial (TFB1M) is involved in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes (T2D) owing to mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we describe that dimethyladenosine transferase 1 homolog (DIMT1), a homologue of TFB1M, is expressed and active in pancreatic {beta}-cells. Like TFB1M, it has been implicated in control of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) but its role in {beta}-cells or T2D remains to be identified. Silencing of DIMT1 impacted mitochondrial function, leading to reduced expression of mitochondrial OXPHOS proteins, reduced oxygen consumption rate (OCR), dissipated mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m) and caused a lower rate of ATP production (mATP). In addition, DIMT1 knockdown slowed the rate of protein synthesis. In accordance with these findings, DIMT1-deficiency perturbed insulin secretion in rodent and human {beta}-cell lines. These effects are likely a result of destabilization of ribosomal assembly, involving NIN1 (RPN12) binding protein 1 homolog (NOB-1) and Pescadillo ribosomal biogenesis factor 1 (PES-1). These are two critical ribosomal subunits proteins, whose interactions were perturbed upon DIMT1-deficiency, thereby disturbing protein synthesis in {beta}-cells. Thus, we have here highlighted a role of DIMT1 in ribosomal biogenesis that perturbs protein synthesis, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and disrupted insulin secretion, both being potential pathogenetic factors in T2D.",

    "abstract": "Quiescence, an actively-maintained reversible state of cell cycle arrest, is not well understood. PTEN is one of the most frequently lost tumor suppressors in human cancers and regulates quiescence of stem cells and cancer cells. In C. elegans mutant for daf-18, the sole C. elegans PTEN ortholog, primordial germ cells (PGCs) divide inappropriately in starvation conditions, in a TOR-dependent manner. Here, we further investigated the role of daf-18 in maintaining PGC quiescence. We found that maternal or zygotic daf-18 is sufficient to maintain cell cycle quiescence, that daf-18 acts in the germ line and soma, and that daf-18 affects timing of PGC divisions in fed animals. Importantly, our results also implicate daf-18 in zygotic germline gene activation, though not in germline fate specification. However, TOR is less important to zygotic germline gene expression, suggesting that in the absence of food daf-18/PTEN prevents inappropriate germline zygotic gene activation and cell division by distinct mechanisms.",
