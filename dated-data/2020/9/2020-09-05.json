    "abstract": "The mental contexts in which we interpret experiences are often person-specific, even when the experiences themselves are shared. We developed a geometric framework for mathematically characterizing the subjective conceptual content of dynamic naturalistic experiences. We model experiences and memories as trajectories through word embedding spaces whose coordinates reflect the universe of thoughts under consideration. Memory encoding can then be modeled as geometrically preserving or distorting the shape of the original experience. We applied our approach to data collected as participants watched and verbally recounted a television episode while undergoing functional neuroimaging. Participants recountings all preserved coarse spatial properties (essential narrative elements), but not fine spatial scale (low-level) details, of the episodes trajectory. We also identified networks of brain structures sensitive to these trajectory shapes. Our work provides insights into how we preserve and distort our ongoing experiences when we encode them into episodic memories.",

    "abstract": "When the human brain manifests the birth of organised communication among local and large-scale neuronal populations activity remains undescribed. We report, in resting-state EEG source-estimates of 100 infants at term age, the existence of macro-scale dynamic functional connectivity, which have rich topological organisations, distinct spectral fingerprints and scale-invariance temporal dynamics. These functional networks encompass the default mode, primary sensory-limbic system, thalamo-frontal, thalamo-sensorimotor and visual-limbic system confined in the delta and low-alpha frequency intervals (1-8 Hz). The temporal dynamics of these networks not only are nested within much slower timescale ({inverted exclamation} 0.1 Hz) but also correlated in a hierarchical leading-following organisation. We show that the anatomically constrained richly organised spatial topologies, spectral contents and temporal fluctuations of resting-state networks reflect an established intrinsic dynamic functional connectome in the human brain at term age. The graph theoretical analysis of the spatial architectures of the networks revealed small-world topology and distinct rich-club organisations of interconnected cortical hubs that exhibit rich synchronous dynamics at multiple timescales. The approach opens new avenues to advance our understanding about the early configuration organisation of dynamic networks in the human brain and offers a novel monitoring platform to investigate functional brain network development in sick preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial multiple drug resistance is a significant issue for the medical community. Gram-negative bacteria exhibit higher rates of multi-drug resistance, partly due to the impermeability of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall and double-membrane cell envelope, which limits the internal accumulation of antibiotic agents. The outer lipopolysaccharide membrane regulates the transport of hydrophobic molecules, while the inner phospholipid membrane controls influx of hydrophilic particles. In Escherichia coli, the gene accA produces the acetyl-CoA carboxylase transferase enzyme required for catalyzing synthesis of fatty acids and phospholipids that compose the inner membrane. To increase antibiotic susceptibility and decrease growth, this study interrupted fatty acid synthesis and disrupted the composition of the inner membrane through inhibiting the gene accA with antisense RNA. This inhibition suppressed expression of luxS, a vital virulence factor that regulates cell growth, transfers intercellular quorum-sensing signals mediated by autoinducer-2, and is necessary for biofilm formation. Bacterial cells in which accA was inhibited also displayed a greater magnitude of antibiotic susceptibility. These findings confirm accA as a potent target for developing novel antibiotics such as antimicrobial gene therapies.",

    "abstract": "Despite ongoing advancements in our understanding of the local single-cellular and network-level activity of neuronal populations in the human brain, extraordinarily little is known about their  intermediate microscale local circuit dynamics. Here, we utilized ultrahigh density microelectrode arrays and a rare opportunity to perform intracranial recordings across multiple cortical areas in human participants to discover three distinct classes of cortical activity that are not locked to ongoing natural brain rhythmic activity. The first included fast waveforms similar to extracellular single unit activity. The other two types were discrete events with slower waveform dynamics and were found preferentially in upper layers of the grey matter. They were also observed in rodents, non-human primates, and semi-chronic recordings in humans via laminar and Utah array microelectrodes. The rates of all three events were selectively modulated by auditory and electrical stimuli, pharmacological manipulation, and cold saline application and had small causal co-occurrences. These results suggest that with the proper combination of high resolution microelectrodes and analytic techniques it is possible to capture neuronal dynamics that lay between somatic action potentials and aggregate population activity and that understanding these intermediate microscale dynamics may reveal important details of the full circuit behavior in human cognition.",

    "abstract": "Infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii, a Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen, are difficult to eradicate due to the bacteriums propensity to quickly gain antibiotic resistances and form biofilms, a protective bacterial multicellular community. The A. baumannii DNA damage response (DDR) mediates the antibiotic resistance acquisition and regulates RecA in an atypical fashion; both RecALow and RecAHigh cell types are formed in response to DNA damage. The findings of this study demonstrate that the levels of RecA can influence the development, formation and dispersal, of biofilms through the global biofilm regulator bfmR. RecA loss results in surface attachment and prominent biofilms, while elevated RecA leads to diminished attachment and dispersal. These findings suggest that the challenge to treat A. baumannii infections may be explained by the induction of the DDR, common during infection, as well as the delicate balance between maintaining biofilms in low RecA cells, and promoting mutagenesis and dispersal in high RecA cells. This study underscores the importance of understanding the fundamental biology of bacteria to develop more effective treatments for infections.",

    "abstract": "O_LIEcologists often invoke interspecific facilitation to help explain positive biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships in plant communities, but seldom test how it occurs. One mechanism through which one species may facilitate another is by ameliorating abiotic stress. Physiological experiments show that a chronic excess of light can cause stress that depresses carbon assimilation. If shading by a plants neighbors reduces light stress enough, it may facilitate that plants growth. If light is instead most often a limiting factor for photosynthesis, shading may have an adverse, competitive effect.\nC_LIO_LIIn a temperate tree diversity experiment, we measured stem growth rates and photosynthetic physiology in broadleaf trees across a gradient of light availability imposed by their neighbors. At the extremes, trees experienced nearly full sun (monoculture), or were shaded by nearby fast-growing conifers (shaded biculture).\nC_LIO_LIMost species had slower growth rates with larger neighbors, implying a net competitive effect. On the other hand, the two most shade-tolerant species (Tilia americana and Acer negundo) and the most shade-intolerant one (Betula papyrifera) had faster stem growth rates with larger neighbors. The two most shade-tolerant species had large increases in photoinhibition (reduced dark-acclimated Fv/Fm) across the gradient of increasing light availability, which suggests they are more vulnerable to chronic light stress. While most species had lower carbon assimilation rates in the shaded biculture treatment, T. americana had rates up to 25% higher. T. americana also dropped its leaves 3-4 weeks earlier in monocultures, curtailing its growing season. We conclude that although large neighbors can cause light limitation in shade-intolerant species, they can also increase growth through abiotic stress amelioration in shade-tolerant species. Finally, in shade-intolerant B. papyrifera, we find a pattern of stem elongation in trees with larger neighbors, which may suggest that a shade avoidance response accounts for the apparent positive trend in stem volume.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis: Both positive and negative species interactions in our experiment can be explained in large part by the photosynthetic responses of trees to the light environment created by their neighbors. We show that photosynthetic physiology can help explain the species interactions that underlie biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships. The insights that ecologists gain by searching for such physiological mechanisms may help us forecast species interactions under environmental change.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe establishment of the small intestinal (SI) lineage during human embryogenesis is critical for the proper development of neonatal gut functions, including nutrient absorption and immune defense. The chromatin dynamics and regulatory networks that drive human SI lineage formation and regional patterning are essentially unknown. To fill this knowledge void, we apply a cutting-edge genomic technology to a state-of-the-art human model of early SI development. Specifically, we leverage chromatin run-on sequencing (ChRO-seq) to define the landscape of active promoters, enhancers, super enhancers, and gene bodies across distinct stages of directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into SI spheroids with regional specification.\n\nResultsThrough comprehensive ChRO-seq analysis we identify candidate stage-specific chromatin activity states, novel markers, and enhancer hotspots during the directed differentiation process. Moreover, we propose a detailed transcriptional network associated with SI lineage formation or initial regional patterning. Among our findings is a unique pattern of enhancer activity and transcription at HOX gene loci that is previously undescribed. Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data from human fetal SI at early developmental time points shed further light on the unique HOX gene temporal dynamics that underlies SI regional patterning.\n\nConclusionsOverall, the results lead to a new proposed working model for the regulatory underpinnings of human SI lineage formation and regional patterning, thereby adding a novel dimension to the literature that has thus far relied almost exclusively on non-human models.",

The NHEJ pathway is necessary for V(D)J recombination in developing B and T lymphocytes. During NHEJ, Ku70 and Ku80 form a heterodimer that recognizes DSBs and promotes recruitment and function of downstream factors PAXX, MRI, DNA-PKcs, Artemis, XLF, XRCC4, and LIG4. Mutations in several known NHEJ genes result in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Inactivation of Mri, Paxx or Xlf in mice results in normal or mild phenotype, while combined inactivation of Xlf/Mri, Xlf/Paxx, or Xlf/Dna-pkcs leads to late embryonic lethality. Here, we describe three new mouse models. We demonstrate that deletion of Trp53 rescues embryonic lethality in mice with combined deficiencies of Xlf and Mri. Furthermore, Xlf-/-Mri-/-Trp53+/- and Xlf-/-Paxx-/-Trp53+/- mice possess reduced body weight, severely reduced mature lymphocyte counts, and accumulation of progenitor B cells. We also report that combined inactivation of Mri/Paxx results in live-born mice with modest phenotype, and combined inactivation of Mri/Dna-pkcs results in embryonic lethality. Therefore, we conclude that XLF is functionally redundant with MRI and PAXX during lymphocyte development in vivo. Moreover, Mri genetically interacts with Dna-pkcs and Paxx.",

    "abstract": "The rate at which plants grow is a major functional trait in plant ecology. However, little is known about its evolution in natural populations. Here, we investigate evolutionary and environmental factors shaping variation in the growth rate of Arabidopsis thaliana. We used plant diameter as a proxy to monitor plant growth over time in environments that mimicked latitudinal differences in the intensity of natural light radiation, across a set of 278 genotypes sampled within four broad regions, including an outgroup set of genotypes from China. A field experiment conducted under natural conditions confirmed the ecological relevance of the observed variation. All genotypes markedly expanded their rosette diameter when the light supply was decreased, demonstrating that environmental plasticity is a predominant source of variation to adapt plant size to prevailing light conditions. Yet, we detected significant levels of genetic variation both in growth rate and growth plasticity. Genome-wide association studies revealed that only 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms associate with genetic variation for growth above Bonferroni confidence levels. However, marginally associated variants were significantly enriched among genes with an annotated role in growth and stress reactions. Polygenic scores computed from marginally associated variants confirmed the polygenic basis of growth variation. For both light regimes, phenotypic divergence between the most distantly related population (China) and the various regions in Europe is smaller than the variation observed within Europe, indicating that some level of stabilizing selection constrains the evolution of growth rate. We observed that Spanish genotypes, however, reach a significantly larger size than Northern European genotypes. Tests of adaptive divergence and analysis of the individual burden of deleterious mutations reveal that adaptive processes have played a more important role in shaping regional differences in rosette growth than maladaptive evolution.",

Separating the Fraser River from southern US populations, and refining additional substructure within the central coast may be possible in mixed-stock analysis; this will be addressed in future work.

In 78 human mother-infant dyads, maternal hair was sampled postnatally, and infants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at term-equivalent age. Higher hair cortisol concentration was associated with higher left amygdala fractional anisotropy ({beta}=0.677, p=0.010), lower left amygdala orientation dispersion index ({beta}=-0.597, p=0.034), and higher fractional anisotropy in connections between the right amygdala and putamen ({beta}=0.475, p=0.007) in girls compared to boys.

    "abstract": "Advances in microscopy imaging technologies have enabled the visualization of live-cell dynamic processes using time-lapse microscopy imaging. However, modern methods exhibit several limitations related to the training phases and to time constraints, hindering their application in the laboratory practice. In this work, we present a novel method, named Automated Cell Detection and Counting (ACDC), designed for activity detection of fluorescent labeled cell nuclei in time-lapse microscopy. ACDC overcomes the limitations of the literature methods, by first applying bilateral filtering on the original image to smooth the input cell images while preserving edge sharpness, and then by exploiting the watershed transform and morphological filtering. Moreover, ACDC represents a feasible solution for the laboratory practice, as it can leverage multi-core architectures in computer clusters to efficiently handle large-scale imaging datasets. Indeed, our Parent-Workers implementation of ACDC allows to obtain up to a 3.7x speed-up compared to the sequential counterpart. ACDC was tested on two distinct cell imaging datasets to assess its accuracy and effectiveness on images with different characteristics. We achieved an accurate cell-count and nuclei segmentation without relying on large-scale annotated datasets, a result confirmed by the average Dice Similarity Coefficients of 76.84 and 88.64 and the Pearson coefficients of 0.99 and 0.96, calculated against the manual cell counting, on the two tested datasets.",

We studied the influence of low-frequency coding variants (MAF < 1%) on multi-dimensional facial shape phenotypes in 2329 healthy Europeans. We used MultiSKAT o scan the exome for face-associated low-frequency variants in a gene-based manner. Seven genes (AR, CARS2, FTSJ1, HFE, LTB4R, TELO2, NECTIN1) were significantly associated with shape variation of the cheek, chin, nose and mouth areas. These genes displayed a wide range of phenotypic effects, with some impacting the full face and others affecting localized regions. The missense variant rs142863092 in NECTIN1 had a significant effect on chin morphology, and was predicted bioinformatically to be deleterious. NECTIN1 is an established craniofacial gene that underlies a human syndrome that includes a mandibular phenotype. We further showed that nectin1a mutations can affect zebrafish craniofacial development, with the size and shape of the mandibular cartilage altered in mutant animals. These Findings highlighted the role of low-frequency coding variants in normal-range facial variation.",

    "abstract": "The critical brain hypothesis suggests that efficient neural computation can be realized through dynamics of the brain characterized by scale-free avalanche activities. However, the relation between human cognitive performance and the avalanche criticality in large-scale brain networks remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed the mean synchronization and synchronization entropy of blood oxygenation level signals from resting-state fMRI. We found that the scale-free avalanche activity was associated with intermediate synchronization and maximal synchronization entropy. The complexity of functional connectivity, as well as structure-function coupling, is maximized by criticality, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. We observed order-disorder phase transitions in resting-state brain dynamics and found that there were longer times spent in the subcritical regime. These results support the hypothesis that large-scale brain networks lie in the vicinity of a critical point. Finally, we showed evidence that the neural dynamics of human participants with higher fluid intelligence and working memory scores are closer to criticality. We identified brain regions whose critical dynamics showed significant positive correlations with fluid intelligence performance, and found these regions were located in the prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal cortex, which are believed to be important nodes of brain networks underlying human intelligence. Our results reveal the role that avalanche criticality plays in cognitive performance, and provide a simple method to identify the critical point and map cortical states on a spectrum of neural dynamics, ranging from subcriticality to supercriticality.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA barcoding technology is gaining innovative applications. The effectiveness of current DNA barcode reference libraries in identifying amphipod barcodes and/or strengthening the existing library was tested. From 2500 amphipod individuals we barcoded 22 amphipod species belonging to 17 genera, 13 families among which 13 species were first time barcoded. More than 80 percent of the species were new distributional records. The minimum and maximum inter-specific pair-wise distance values was respectively 0.16 and 5.51 percent. Defining family specific species threshold values would be imperative, rather than expecting a universal barcode gap for amphipod species. The overall mean pair-wise distance, nucleotide diversity and Tajimas statistics were 3.59 percent, 0.27 and 2.62, respectively. There is a strong need to increase the number of amphipod species barcodes in the reference database. For better facilitation of environmental monitoring, the datasets could be exclusively accessed at BOLD through http://dx.doi.org/10.5883/DS-MAOI.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial systems have gained wide attention for depolymerization of lignocellulosic biomass, due to their high functional diversity and adaptability. To achieve the full microbial exploitation of lignocellulosic residues and the cost-effective production of bioproducts within a biorefinery, multiple metabolic pathways and enzymes of various specificities are required. In this work, highly diverse aerobic, mesophilic bacteria enriched from Keri Lake, a pristine marsh of increased biomass degradation and natural underground oil leaks, were explored for their metabolic versatility and enzymatic potential towards lignocellulosic substrates. A wide diversity of Pseudomonas species were obtained from enrichment cultures where organosolv lignin served as the sole carbon and energy source and were able to assimilate a range of lignin-associated aromatic compounds. Highly complex bacterial consortia were also enriched in cultures with xylan or carboxymethyl cellulose as sole carbon sources, belonging to Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacilli, Sphingobacteriia, and Flavobacteria. Numerous individual isolates could target diverse structural lignocellulose polysaccharides by expressing hydrolytic activities on crystalline or amorphous cellulose and xylan. Specific isolates showed increased potential for growth in lignin hydrolysates prepared from alkali pretreated agricultural wastes. The results suggest that Keri isolates represent a pool of effective lignocellulose degraders with significant potential for industrial applications in a lignocellulose biorefinery.",

    "abstract": "The genome is not a linear molecule of DNA randomly folded in the nucleus, but exists as an organized, three-dimensional (3D) dynamic architecture. Intriguingly, it is now clear that each cell type has a unique and characteristic 3D genome organization that functions in determining cell identity during development. A currently challenging basic question is how cell-type specific 3D genome structures are established during development. Herein, we analyzed 3D genome structures in primary myoblasts and myocytes from MyoD knockout (MKO) and wild type (WT) mice and discovered that MyoD, a pioneer transcription factor (TF), can function as a \"genome organizer\" that specifies the proper 3D genome architecture unique to muscle cell development. Importantly, we genetically demonstrate that H3K27ac is insufficient for establishing MyoD-induced chromatin loops in muscle cells. The establishment of MyoDs \"architectural role\" should have profound impacts on advancing understanding of other pioneer transcription factors in orchestrating lineage specific 3D genome organization during development in a potentially very large number of cell types in diverse organisms.",

    "abstract": "Two-photon microscopy together with fluorescent proteins and fluorescent protein-based biosensors are commonly used tools in neuroscience. To enhance their experimental scope, it is important to optimize fluorescent proteins for two-photon excitation. Directed evolution of fluorescent proteins under one-photon excitation is common, but many one-photon properties do not correlate with two-photon properties. A simple system for expressing fluorescent protein mutants is E. coli colonies on an agar plate. The small focal volume of two-photon excitation makes creating a high throughput screen in this system a challenge for a conventional point-scanning approach. We present an instrument and accompanying software that solves this challenge by selectively scanning each colony based on a colony map captured under one-photon excitation. This instrument, called the GIZMO, can measure the two-photon excited fluorescence of 10,000 E. coli colonies in 7 hours. We show that the GIZMO can be used to evolve a fluorescent protein under two-photon excitation.",

The AAVS1 site is the site which is disrupted upon integration of Adeno Associated Virus (AAV) and is considered a  safe-harbor in human genome because about one third of humans are infected with AAV and so far there is no apodictic evidence that AAV is pathogenic or disruption of AAVS1 causes any disease in man. Therefore, we chose to target AAVS1 site for the insertion of ABCB11, a bile acid transporter which is defective in Progressive Familial Intra Hepatic Cholestasis Type-2 (PFIC-2), a lethal disease of children where cytotoxic bile salts accumulate inside hepatocytes killing them and eventually the patient.\n\nMethodsWe used CRISPR Cas9 a genome editing tool to insert ABCB11 gene at AAVS1 site in human cell-lines.\n\nResultsWe found that human ABCB11 sequence has a \"Pribnow- Schaller Box\" which allows its expression in bacteria and expression of ABCB11 protein which is toxic to E. coli and the removal of the same was required for successful cloning.

These factors and outcomes have also been associated to, or affected by, the process of aging. Here, we investigated whether murine white (WAT) and brown (BAT) adipose tissue lipids exhibit rhythmicity and if this is affected by aging. To this end, we have measured the 24 hour lipid profiles of WAT and BAT using a global lipidomics analysis of >1100 lipids. We observed rhythmicity in nearly all lipid classes including glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sterol lipids and sphingolipids. Overall, ~22% of the analyzed lipids were considered rhythmic in WAT and BAT. Despite a general accumulation of lipids upon aging the fraction of oscillating lipids decreased in both tissues to 14% and 18%, respectively. Diurnal profiles of lipids in BAT appeared to depend on the lipid acyl chain length and this specific regulation was lost in aged mice. Our study revealed how aging affects the rhythmicity of lipid metabolism and could contribute to the quest for targets that improve diurnal lipid homeostasis to maintain cardiometabolic health during aging.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsPrimary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease characterized by progressive destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The immunopathology of PBC involves excessive inflammation; therefore, negative regulators of inflammatory response, such as Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1-Induced Protein-1 (MCPIP1, alias Regnase1) may play important roles in the development of PBC. The aim of this work was to verify whether Mcpip1 expression protects against development of PBC.\n\nMethodsGenetic deletion of Zc3h12a was used to characterize the role of Mcpip1 in the pathogenesis of PBC. 6-52-week-old Mcpip1fl/fl and Mcpip1AlbKO mice were used for immunohistochemical, biochemical and molecular tests.\n\nResultsWe found that Mcpip1 deficiency in the liver recapitulates most of the features of human PBC, in contrast to mice with Mcpip1 deficiency in myeloid cells (Mcpip1LysMKO mice), which present with robust myeloid cell-driven systemic inflammation. In Mcpip1AlbKO livers, intrahepatic bile ducts displayed proliferative changes with inflammatory infiltration, bile duct destruction, and fibrosis leading to cholestasis. In plasma, increased concentrations of IgG, IgM, and AMA autoantibodies (anti-PDC-E2) were detected. Interestingly, the phenotype of Mcpip1AlbKO mice was robust in 6-week-old and 52-week-old mice, but milder in 12-24-week-old mice, suggesting early prenatal origin of the phenotype and age-dependent progression of the disease. Hepatic transcriptome analysis of 6-week-old and 24-week-old Mcpip1AlbKO mice showed 812 and 8 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, compared with age-matched control mice, and revealed a distinct set of genes compared to those previously associated with development of PBC.\n\nConclusionsThe phenotype of Mcpip1AlbKO mice recapitulates most of the features of human PBC, and demonstrates early prenatal origin and age-dependent progression of PBC. Therefore, Mcpip1AlbKO mice provide a unique model for the study of PBC.\n\nLay summaryDeletion of hepatic Mcpip1 in Mcpip1AlbKO mice leads to development of PBC that recapitulates phenotype of human patients.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of response bias (the sensory-independent factor) on resolution thresholds of Sloan letters in central and paracentral vision.\n\nMethodsNine subjects with normal ocular health were recruited for this study. Using the method of constant stimuli, individual Sloan letters resolution thresholds were measured at 0{degrees} (central) and at {+/-}3{degrees} eccentricity along the vertical meridian of the visual field. Response biases and letter similarities were computed using Luces choice model.\n\nResultsResults showed that the differences in resolution thresholds of individual Sloan letters were significant at the central (F (9, 80) =5.02, p<.001), the upper ({chi}2 (9) = 50.38, p<.05) and the lower ({chi}2 (9) = 56.32, p<.05) visual field locations. Unlike letter similarity measures, response biases showed significant correlations to the differences in thresholds at the central (r = -0.83, p<.05), the upper (r = - 0.73, p<.05) and the lower (r = -0.70, p<.05) visual field locations.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest that response biases have a significant effect on resolution of Sloan letters that could result in overestimating resolution acuity in central and paracentral visual field locations.",

    "abstract": "Visual signals influence the brains computation of spatial position and orientation. Accordingly, the primary visual cortex (V1) is extensively interconnected with areas involved in computing head direction (HD) information. Predictive coding theories posit that higher cortical areas send sensory or motor predictions to lower areas, but whether this includes cognitive variables like the HD signal--and whether HD information is present in V1--is unknown. Here we show that V1 encodes the yaw, roll, and pitch of the head in freely behaving rats, either in the presence or absence of visual cues. HD tuning was modulated by lighting and movement state, but was stable on a population level for over a week. These results demonstrate the presence of a critical spatial orientation signal in a primary cortical sensory area and support predictive coding theories of brain function.",

    "abstract": "The Pleistocene glacial cycles had a profound impact on the ranges and genetic make-up of organisms. Whilst it is clear that the contact zones that have been described for many sister taxa are secondary and have formed during the last interglacial, it is unclear when the taxa involved began to diverge. Previous estimates based on small numbers of loci are unreliable given the stochasticity of genetic drift and the contrasting effects of incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow on gene divergence. Here we use genome-wide transcriptome data to estimate divergence for 18 sister species pairs of European butterflies showing either sympatric or contact zone distributions. We find that in most cases species divergence predates the mid-Pleistocene transition or even the entire Pleistocene period. We also show that although post divergence gene flow is restricted to contact zone pairs, they are not systematically younger than sympatric pairs. This suggests that contact zones are not limited to the embryonic stages of the speciation process, but can involve notably old taxa. Finally, we show that mitochondrial and nuclear divergence are only weakly correlated and mitochondrial divergence is higher for contact-zone pairs. This suggests a possible role of selective sweeps affecting mitochondrial variation in maintaining contact zones.\n\nImpact SummaryThe influence of the Pleistocene glacial cycles on structuring species and genetic diversity in temperate taxa has permeated biogeographic and phylogeographic thinking for decades. Although phylogeographic studies have repeatedly claimed that the Pleistocene acted as a species pump, systematic tests of this idea based on robust estimates of species divergence are lacking. Here we estimate divergence times for all sister species pairs of European butterfly using genome-wide transcriptome data. We find that most species pairs are substantially older than the onset of Pleistocene glacial cycling. We also show that post divergence gene flow is restricted to pairs that form contact-zones. However, in contrast to expectations under a null model of allopatric speciation contract zone pairs are not necessarily younger than sympatric pairs.",

    "abstract": "Environmental features can alter the behaviours and phenotypes of organisms and populations evolving within them including the dynamics between natural and sexual selection. Experimental environmental manipulation, particularly when conducted in experiments where the dynamics of the purging of deleterious alleles are compared, has demonstrated both direct and indirect effects on the strength and direction of selection. However, many of these experiments are conducted with fairly simplistic environments when it is not always clear how or why particular forms of spatial heterogeneity may influence behaviour or selection. Using Drosophila melanogaster, we tested three different spatial environments designed to determine if spatial constraint of critical resources influences the efficiency of natural and sexual selection. We conducted two allele purging experiments to 1) assess the effects of these spatial treatments on the selective dynamics of six recessive mutations, and 2) determine how these dynamics changed when sexual selection was relaxed and the spatial area was reduced. We found that allele purging dynamics depended on spatial environment, however the patterns of purging rates between the environments differed across distinct deleterious mutations. We also found that for two of the mutations, the addition of sexual selection increased the purging rate.",

Here, we present a statistical investigation of the second dogma linking the phenotypic and transcriptional differences to the genomic changes across species, revealing the regulatory genomic sequence differences underlying these inter-species differences. We show that gain or loss of specific transcription factor binding site sequences are connected to the inter-species gene-expression differences in a statistically significant manner, with a particularly larger effect on stromal genes related to invasibility. We also uncover transcriptional factors differentially regulating genes related to pro- and anti- invasible property of stroma. This work extends the understanding of inter-species differences in stromal invasion to the causal genomic sequence differences paving new avenues to target stromal characteristics to regulate placental, or cancer invasion.",

    "abstract": "Unraveling the origin of molecular pathways underlying the evolution of adaptive traits is essential for understanding how new lineages emerge, including the relative contribution of conserved, ancestral traits, and newly evolved, derived traits. Here, we investigated the evolutionary divergence of sex pheromone communication from moths (mostly nocturnal) to butterflies (mostly diurnal) that occurred ~98 million years ago. In moths, females typically emit pheromones to attract male mates, but in butterflies pheromones and used by females for mate choice. The molecular bases of sex pheromone communication are well understood in moths, but have remained virtually unexplored in butterflies. We used a combination of transcriptomics, real time qPCR, and phylogenetics, to identify genes involved in different steps of sex pheromone communication in the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. Our results show that the biosynthesis and reception of sex pheromones relies both on moth-specific gene families (reductases) and on more ancestral insect gene families (desaturases, olfactory receptors, odorant binding proteins). Interestingly, B. anynana further appears to use what was believed to be the moth-specific neuropeptide Pheromone Biosynthesis Activating Neuropeptide (PBAN) for regulation of sex pheromone production. Altogether, our results suggest that a mosaic pattern best explains how sex pheromone communication evolved in butterflies, with some molecular components derived from moths, and others conserved from more ancient insect ancestors. This is the first large-scale analysis of the genetic pathways underlying sex pheromone communication in a butterfly.",

In this species, female-like hermaphrodites have been shown to produce sperm and self-fertilize. However, rare males are sometimes observed too. In a large population-genetic analysis, we show for the first time that although self-fertilization appears to be the primary mode of reproduction, rare outbreeding events between males and hermaphrodites do occur, and we thereby confirm androdioecy as the mating system of I. purchasi.

Similarly, the mutational landscape of both epithelial and stromal components of the mammary gland has not been investigated. Both are relevant for breast cancer (BC), as the interplay between age, pregnancy, and cancer risk has not been fully characterized11. We describe whole genome sequencing analysis of epithelial and stromal compartments from the normal breast. We show that, in a similar way to other normal organs, the mutational burden of the mammary nulliparous epithelium significantly increases with age. In a nulliparous status, mutated clones are maintained at a consistently small size throughout the life of the individual; however, at parity, pre-existent clones significantly increase in size with age. Both epithelial and stromal compartments of the healthy breast contain pre-existing known cancer mutations, albeit at low rate, indicative of subsequent positive selection for mutations in tissue-specific driver genes. In line with this, both compartments also present gene enrichment in preferentially mutated cancer pathways. Our results show that mutational landscapes differ between the parous and nulliparous epithelium and suggest an explanation for both differential breast cancer risk and development of pregnancy-associated BC (PABC).",

    "abstract": "Environmental cues attain the ability to guide behavior via learned associations. As predictors, cues can elicit adaptive behavior and lead to valuable resources (e.g., food). For some individuals, however, cues are transformed into incentive stimuli and elicit motivational states that can be maladaptive. The goal-tracker/sign-tracker animal model captures individual differences in cue-motivated behaviors, with reward-associated cues serving as predictors of reward for both phenotypes but becoming incentive stimuli to a greater degree for sign-trackers. While these distinct phenotypes are characterized based on Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior, they exhibit differences on a number of behaviors relevant to psychopathology. To further characterize the neurobehavioral endophenotype associated with individual differences in cue-reward learning, neuroendocrine and behavioral profiles associated with stress and anxiety were investigated in male goal-tracker, sign-tracker, and intermediate responder rats. It was revealed that baseline corticosterone increases with Pavlovian learning, but to the same degree, regardless of phenotype. No significant differences in behavior were observed between goaltrackers and sign-trackers during an elevated plus maze or open field test, nor were there differences in corticosterone response to the open field test or physiological restraint. Upon examination of central markers associated with stress-reactivity, we found that sign-trackers have greater glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression in the ventral hippocampus, with no phenotypic differences in the dorsal hippocampus or prelimbic cortex. These findings demonstrate that goal-trackers and sign-trackers do not differ on stress- and anxiety-related behaviors, and suggest that differences in neuroendocrine measures between these phenotypes can be attributed to distinct cue-reward learning styles.\n\nSignificance StatementWhile the goal-tracker/ sign-tracker animal model derives from individual differences in Pavlovian conditioned approach behavior, other traits, including some of relevance to addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder, have been shown to co-exist with the propensity to sign-track. The extent to which this model encompasses differences in aversive arousal and associated neuroendocrine measures, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we show that behavioral and corticosterone response to stress-related paradigms do not differ between goal-trackers and sign-trackers. However, glucocorticoid receptor expression in the ventral hippocampus does differ between phenotypes, suggesting that this central marker that is typically associated with stress-responsivity, may, in fact, play an important role in appetitive motivation.",

If confirmed, this has important implications for crop breeding.\n\nWe present the first large-sale investigation of kin recognition in a crop germplasm collection comprising 30 North-European cultivars and landraces of spring wheat, spanning 100 years of breeding history. In a full diallel in vitro bioassay, we compared root growth of seedlings when growing in pure substrate, or in substrate previously occupied by a donor seedling from the same (KIN) or another (NONKIN) genotype.\n\nSeedlings growing in KIN or NONKIN substrate generally had longer but not more roots than seedlings growing in pure substrate. Responses were generally larger in longer roots, suggesting that root elongation was promoted throughout the growth period. Responses to KIN and NONKIN substrates were found to range from positive to negative, with root length responses to kin being increasingly positive with year of release. Seedlings growing in KIN substrate generally had shorter but not fewer roots than seedlings growing in NONKIN substrate. This kin recognition ranged from positive to negative across the specific donor-receiver combinations and did not change systematically with year of release of either genotype. Root traits in both KIN and NONKIN substrate were affected by both donor and receiver genotype, and these effects were generally larger than the effect of specific combinations. Genotypes showing higher levels of kin recognition also tended to invoke larger responses in other genotypes. Kin recognition was reduced in most cases by the addition of sodiumorthovanadate, a chemical inhibitor, supporting the hypothesis that kin responses were mediated by changes in the chemical constitution of the substrate.\n\nThe identified patterns of kin recognition across the germplasm collection were complex, suggesting a multigenic background and shared breeding history of the genotypes. We conclude that kin response represents a potential target for crop breeding which can improve root foraging and competitive interactions.",

    "abstract": "Arms race co-evolution drives rapid adaptive changes in pathogens and in the immune systems of their hosts. Plant intracellular NLR immune receptors detect effectors delivered by pathogens to promote susceptibility, activating an immune response that halts colonization. As a consequence, pathogen effectors evolve to escape immune recognition and are highly variable. In turn, NLR receptors are one of the most diverse protein families in plants, and this variability underpins differential recognition of effector variants. The molecular mechanisms underlying natural variation in effector recognition by NLRs are starting to be elucidated. The rice NLR pair Pik-1/Pik-2 recognizes AVR-Pik effectors from the blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, triggering immune responses that limit rice blast infection. Allelic variation in a heavy metal associated (HMA) domain integrated in the receptor Pik-1 confers differential binding to AVR-Pik variants, determining resistance specificity. Previous mechanistic studies uncovered how a Pik allele, Pikm, has extended recognition to effector variants through a specialized HMA/AVR-Pik binding interface. Here, we reveal the mechanistic basis of extended recognition specificity conferred by another Pik allele, Pikh. A single residue in Pikh-HMA increases binding to AVR-Pik variants, leading to an extended effector response in planta. The crystal structure of Pikh-HMA in complex with an AVR-Pik variant confirmed that Pikh and Pikm use a similar molecular mechanism to extend their pathogen recognition profile. This study shows how different NLR receptor alleles functionally converge to extend recognition specificity to pathogen effectors.\n\nAuthor SummaryPlant pathogens constantly evolve to overcome immune defences and successfully colonize hosts, resulting in some of the most devastating diseases that affect global food production. To defend themselves, plants have evolved a sophisticated immune system that recognizes the presence of different pathogens and triggers immune responses to stop their spread. How plant immune receptors achieve extended recognition to specific pathogen strains and the molecular details of this recognition are just starting to be understood.\n\nIn this study, we characterize how an allele of a rice immune receptor achieves a broad-spectrum recognition to effectors from the rice blast fungus. We found that this receptor has evolved a single change that alters the way it binds to different effector variants. This change increases binding affinity to these variants and this is ultimately translated to immune recognition. Interestingly, a different rice immune receptor allele also achieves broad-spectrum effector recognition in a similar way. Therefore, different immune receptor alleles can converge on a similar mechanism to achieve extended recognition to pathogen effectors.\n\nThis knowledge has the potential to help to the rational design of plant immune receptors with bespoke resistance to some of the most destructive pathogens.

    "abstract": "Transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS), a non-invasive neuromodulatory technique capable of altering cortical activity, has been proposed to improve the signal-to-noise ratio at the neuronal level and the sensitivity of the neurons following an inverted U-function. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of tRNS on vGLUT1 and GAD 65-67 and its safety in terms of pathological changes. For that, juvenile mice were randomly distributed in three different groups: \"tRNS 1x\" receiving tRNS at the density current used in humans (0.3 A/m2, 20 min), \"tRNS 100x\" receiving tRNS at two orders of magnitude higher (30.0 A/m2, 20 min) and \"sham\" (0.3 A/m2, 15 s). Nine tRNS sessions during five weeks were administered to the prefrontal cortex of alert animals. No detectable tissue macroscopic lesions were observed after tRNS sessions. Post-stimulation immunohistochemical analysis of GAD 65-67 and vGLUT1 immunoreactivity showed a reduced GAD 65-67 immunoreactivity levels in the region directly beneath the electrode for tRNS 1x group with no significant effects in the tRNS 100x nor sham group. The observed results points to an excitatory effect associated with a decrease in GABA levels in absence of major histopathological alterations providing a novel mechanistic explanation for tRNS effects.",

    "abstract": "Injured axons must regenerate to restore nervous system function, and regeneration is regulated in part by external factors from non-neuronal tissues. Many of these extrinsic factors act in the immediate cellular environment of the axon to promote or restrict regeneration, but the existence of long-distance signals regulating axon regeneration has not been clear. Here we show that the Rab GTPase rab-27 inhibits regeneration of GABAergic motor neurons in C. elegans through activity in the intestine. Re-expression of RAB-27, but not the closely related RAB-3, in the intestine of rab-27 mutant animals is sufficient to rescue normal regeneration. Several additional components of an intestinal neuropeptide secretion pathway also inhibit axon regeneration, including NPDC1/cab-1, SNAP25/aex-4, and KPC3/aex-5. Together these data indicate that RAB-27-dependent neuropeptide secretion from the intestine inhibits axon regeneration, and point to distal tissues as potent extrinsic regulators of regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral strategies that depend on sensory information are not immutable; rather they can be shaped by the specific sensory context in which animals develop. This behavioral plasticity depends on the remarkable capacity for the brain to reorganize in response to alterations in the sensory environment, particularly when changes in sensory input occur at an early age. To study this phenomenon, we utilize the short-tailed opossum, a marsupial that has been a valuable animal model to study developmental plasticity due to the extremely immature state of its nervous system at birth. Previous studies in opossums have demonstrated that removal of retinal inputs early in development results in profound alterations to cortical connectivity and functional organization of visual and somatosensory cortex; however, behavioral consequences of this plasticity are not well understood. We trained early blind (EB) and sighted control (SC) opossums to perform a two-alternative forced choice texture discrimination task. Whisker trimming caused an acute deficit in discrimination accuracy for both EB and SC animals indicating that they primarily used a whisker-based strategy to guide choices based on tactile cues - though performance recovered in days, suggesting a shift to the use of other body parts when whiskers were absent. Mystacial whiskers were important for performance in both groups; however, genal whiskers only contributed to performance in EB animals. EB opossums significantly outperformed SC opossums in discrimination accuracy, being more sensitive to textural differences by ~75 m smaller. Our results support behavioral compensation following early blindness using tactile inputs, especially the whisker system.",

    "abstract": "Despite viral suppression due to combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND) continue to affect half of people with HIV, suggesting that certain antiretrovirals (ARVs) may contribute to HAND. We examined the effects of nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors tenofovir disproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) and the integrase inhibitors dolutegravir (DTG) and elvitegravir (EVG) on viability, structure, and function of glutamatergic neurons (a subtype of CNS neuron involved in cognition) derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-neurons), and primary human neural precursor cells (hNPCs), which are responsible for neurogenesis. Using automated digital microscopy and image analysis (high content analysis, HCA), we found that DTG, EVG, and TDF decreased hiPSC-neuron viability, neurites, and synapses after seven days of treatment. Analysis of hiPSC-neuron calcium activity using Kinetic Image Cytometry (KIC) demonstrated that DTG and EVG also decreased the frequency and magnitude of intracellular calcium transients. Longer ARV exposures and simultaneous exposure to multiple ARVs increased the magnitude of these neurotoxic effects. Using the Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes (MIEL) assay, we found that TDF decreased hNPC viability and changed the distribution of histone modifications that regulate chromatin packing, suggesting that TDF may reduce neuroprogenitor pools important for CNS development and maintenance of cognition in adults. This study establishes human preclinical assays that can screen potential ARVs for CNS toxicity to develop safer cART regimens and HAND therapeutics.",

TRPV1 sensitisation is induced and maintained by two major mechanisms; post-translational and transcriptional changes in TRPV1 induced by inflammatory mediators produced and accumulated in injured tissues, and TRPV1 activation-induced feed-forward signalling. The latter mechanism includes synthesis of TRPV1 agonists within minutes, and upregulation of various receptors functionally linked to TRPV1 within a few hours, in nociceptive primary sensory neurons. Here, we report that a novel mechanism, which contributes to TRPV1 activation-induced TRPV1-sensitisation within ~30 minutes in at least ~30% of TRPV1-expressing cultured murine primary sensory neurons, is mediated through upregulation in cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) expression and increased synthesis of a series of COX2 products. These findings highlight the importance of feed-forward signalling in sensitisation, and the value of inhibiting COX2 activity to control pain, in nociceptive primary sensory neurons in tissue injuries.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorus (P) is an essential component of several core biological molecules. In bacteria, P is mainly acquired as inorganic orthophosphate (Pi). Once in the cytoplasm, Pi is incorporated into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which exists primarily as a Mg2+ salt. Notably, whereas P is essential, excess of cytosolic Pi hinders growth. Here we demonstrate that cytotoxic effects of excessive Pi uptake result from its assimilation into ATP and subsequent disruption of Mg2+ dependent processes. We show that Salmonella enterica cells experiencing cytoplasmic Mg2+ starvation restrict Pi uptake, thereby limiting the availability of an ATP precursor. This response prevents excessive ATP synthesis, overproduction of ribosomal RNA, chelation of free cytoplasmic Mg2+ and the destabilization of Mg2+-dependent core processes that ultimately hinder bacterial growth and leads to loss of cellular viability. We demonstrate that, even when cytoplasmic Mg2+ is not limiting, excessive Pi uptake leads to increased ATP synthesis, depletion of free cytoplasmic Mg2+, inhibition of translation and growth. Our results establish that bacteria must restrict Pi uptake to prevent the depletion of cytoplasmic Mg2+. Furthermore, they provide a framework to understand the molecular basis of Pi cytotoxicity and reveal a regulatory logic employed by bacterial cells to control P assimilation.\n\nImportancePhosphorus (P) is essential for life. As the fifth most abundant element in living cells, P is required for the synthesis of an array of biological molecules including (d)NTPs, nucleic acids and membranes. Organisms typically acquire environmental P as inorganic phosphate. While essential for growth and viability, excessive intracellular Pi is toxic for both bacteria and eukaryotes. Using the bacterium Salmonella enterica as a model, we demonstrate that Pi cytotoxicity is manifested following its assimilation into ATP, which acts as a chelating agent for intracellular cations, most notably, Mg2+. These results identify physiological processes disrupted by excessive Pi and elucidate a regulatory logic employed by bacteria to prevent uncontrollable P assimilation.",

Previous studies have reported that PRC2 interacts with RNA in a promiscuous manner, but the biological functions of such interaction are unknown. Here we present a seesaw mechanism for the regulation of {varepsilon}-globin through inactivating EZH2 by an upstream non-coding RNA (LEVER). We show that LEVER, a non-coding RNA identified by RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) of the PRC2 core subunit EZH2 and Nanopore sequencing, binds PRC2 and thereby prevents the accumulation of H3K27 methylation along the genomic region where LEVER RNA is transcribed. The open chromatin within the LEVER locus in turn competes for the chromatin interaction between the {varepsilon}-globin promoter and the Locus Control Region (LCR), working as a negative regulatory element of {varepsilon}-globin expression. Hence, LEVER RNA negatively regulates {varepsilon}-globin by sequestering PRC2 from repressing the LEVER locus, which is a competitor of the {varepsilon}-globin-LCR interaction.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs are the epitome of species diversity, yet the number of described scleractinian coral species, the framework-builders of coral reefs, remains moderate by comparison. DNA sequencing studies are rapidly challenging this notion by exposing a wealth of undescribed diversity, but the evolutionary and ecological significance of this diversity remains largely unclear. Here, we present an annotated genome for one of the most ubiquitous corals in the Indo-Pacific (Pachyseris speciosa), and uncover through a comprehensive genomic and phenotypic assessment that it comprises morphologically indistinguishable, but ecologically divergent cryptic lineages. Demographic modelling based on whole-genome resequencing disproved that morphological crypsis was due to recent divergence, and instead indicated ancient morphological stasis. Although the lineages occur sympatrically across shallow and mesophotic habitats, extensive genotyping using a rapid diagnostic assay revealed differentiation of their ecological distributions. Leveraging \"common garden\" conditions facilitated by the overlapping distributions, we assessed physiological and quantitative skeletal traits and demonstrated concurrent phenotypic differentiation. Lastly, spawning observations of genotyped colonies highlighted the potential role of temporal reproductive isolation in the limited admixture, with consistent genomic signatures in genes related to morphogenesis and reproduction. Overall, our findings demonstrate how ecologically and phenotypically divergent coral species can evolve despite morphological stasis, and provide new leads into the potential mechanisms facilitating such divergence in sympatry. More broadly, they indicate that our current taxonomic framework for reef-building corals may be scratching the surface of the ecologically relevant diversity on coral reefs, consequently limiting our ability to protect or restore this diversity effectively.",

    "abstract": "Genetic, biochemical, and structural studies have elucidated the molecular basis for spliceosome catalysis. Splicing is RNA catalyzed and the essential snRNA and protein factors are well-conserved. However, little is known about how non-essential components of the spliceosome contribute to the reaction and modulate the activities of the fundamental core machinery. Ecm2 is a non-essential yeast splicing factor that is a member of the Prp19-related complex of proteins. Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures have revealed that Ecm2 binds the U6 snRNA and is entangled with Cwc2, another non-essential factor that promotes a catalytically active conformation of the spliceosome. These structures also indicate that Ecm2 and the U2 snRNA likely form a transient interaction during 5 splice site (SS) cleavage. We have characterized genetic interactions between ECM2 and alleles of splicing factors that alter the catalytic steps in splicing. In addition, we have studied how loss of ECM2 impacts splicing of pre-mRNAs containing non-consensus or competing SS. Our results show that ECM2 functions during the catalytic stages of splicing. It facilitates the formation and stabilization of the 1st-step catalytic site, promotes 2nd-step catalysis, and permits alternate 5 SS usage. We propose that Cwc2 and Ecm2 can each fine-tune the spliceosome active site in unique ways. Their interaction network may act as a conduit through which splicing of certain pre-mRNAs, such as those containing weak or alternate splice sites, can be regulated.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide association and fine-mapping studies have enabled the discovery of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other variants that are significantly associated with many autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes (T1D). However, many of the SNPs lie in non-coding regions, limiting the identification of mechanisms that contribute to autoimmune disease progression.\n\nMethodsAutoimmunity results from a failure of immune tolerance, suggesting that regulatory T cells (Treg) are likely a significant point of impact for this genetic risk, as Treg are critical for immune tolerance. Focusing on T1D as a model of defective function of Treg in autoimmunity, we designed a SNPs filtering workflow called 3 Dimensional Functional Annotation of Accessible Cell Type Specific SNPs (3DFAACTS-SNP) that utilises overlapping profiles of Treg-specific epigenomic data (ATAC-seq, Hi-C and FOXP3-ChIP) to identify regulatory elements potentially driving the effect of variants associated with T1D, and the gene(s) that they control.\n\nResultsUsing 3DFAACTS-SNP we identified 36 SNPs with plausible Treg-specific mechanisms of action contributing to T1D from 1,228 T1D fine-mapped variants, identifying 119 novel interacting regions resulting in the identification of 51 candidate target genes. We further demonstrated the utility of the workflow by applying it to three other fine-mapped/meta-analysed SNP autoimmune datasets, identifying 17 Treg-centric candidate variants and 35 interacting genes. Finally, we demonstrate the broad utility of 3DFAACTS-SNP for functional annotation of any genetic variation using all common (>10% allele frequency) variants from the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD). We identified 7,900 candidate variants and 3,245 candidate target genes, generating a list of potential sites for future T1D or autoimmune research.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that it is possible to further prioritise variants that contribute to T1D based on regulatory function and illustrate the power of using cell type specific multi-omics datasets to determine disease mechanisms. The 3DFAACTS-SNP workflow can be customised to any cell type for which the individual datasets for functional annotation have been generated, giving broad applicability and utility.",

We show that BayesSpace improves the identification of transcriptionally distinct tissues from spatial transcriptomics samples of the brain, of melanoma, and of squamous cell carcinoma. In particular, BayesSpaces improved resolution allows the identification of tissue structure that is not detectable at the original resolution and thus not recovered by other methods. Using an in silico dataset constructed from scRNA-seq, we demonstrate that BayesSpace can spatially resolve expression patterns to near single-cell resolution without the need for external single-cell sequencing data. In all, our results illustrate the utility BayesSpace has in facilitating the discovery of biological insights from a variety of spatial transcriptomics datasets.",

    "abstract": "Immune receptor signalling proceeds by the binding (or tethering) of enzymes to their cytoplasmic tails before they catalyse reactions on substrates within reach. This is the case for the enzyme SHP-1 that, upon tethering to the inhibitory receptor PD-1, dephosphorylates membrane substrates to suppress T cell activation. Precisely how tethering regulates SHP-1 activity is incompletely understood. Here, we use surface plasmon resonance to measure binding, catalysis, and molecular reach for PD-1 tethered SHP-1 reactions. We find that the reach of PD-1--SHP-1 complexes is dominated by the 13.0 nm reach of SHP-1 itself. This is longer than an estimate from the structure of the allosterically active conformation (5.3 nm), suggesting that SHP-1 explores multiple active conformations. Using modelling, we show that when uniformly distributed, PD-1--SHP-1 complexes can only reach 15% of substrates but this increases to 90% when they are co-clustered. When within reach, we show that membrane recruitment increases the activity of SHP-1 by a 1000-fold increase in local concentration. The work highlights how molecular reach regulates the activity of membrane-recruited SHP-1 with insights applicable to other membrane-tethered reactions.\n\nSignificance statementImmune receptors transduce signals by recruiting (or tethering) cytoplasmic enzymes to their tails at the membrane. When tethered, these enzymes catalyse reactions on other substrates to propagate signalling. Precisely how membrane tethering regulates enzyme activity is incompletely understood. Unlike other tethered reactions, where the enzyme tethers to the substrate, the substrate in this case is a different receptor tail. Therefore, the ability of the receptor-tethered enzyme to reach a substrate can be critical in controlling reaction rates. In this work, we determine the molecular reach for the enzyme SHP-1 and the receptor PD-1 to which it can tether, and show how molecular reach controls receptor signalling.",

    "abstract": "The emergent properties of the array arrangement of the molecular motor myosin II in the sarcomere of the striated muscle, generation of steady force and shortening, can be studied in vitro with a synthetic nanomachine, made by an ensemble of eight HMM myosin fragments from rabbit psoas muscle carried on a piezoelectric nanopositioner and brought to interact with a properly oriented actin filament attached via gelsolin (a Ca2+-regulated actin binding protein) to a bead trapped by a Dual Laser Optical Tweezers. The application of the original version of the nanomachine to investigation of the Ca2+-dependent regulation mechanisms of the other sarcomeric (regulatory or cytoskeleton) proteins, adding them on at a time, was anyway prevented by the impossibility to preserve Ca2+ as a free parameter. Here the nanomachine is implemented by assembling the bead-attached actin filament with the Ca2+-insensitive gelsolin fragment TL40. The performance of the nanomachine is determined either in the absence or in the presence of 0.1 mM Ca2+ (the concentration required for BTA preparation with gelsolin). The nanomachine exhibits a maximum power output of 5.4 aW, independently of [Ca2+], opening the possibility for future studies of the Ca2+-dependent function/dysfunction of regulatory and cytoskeletal proteins.",

    "abstract": "The DISP1 protein, related to the NPC1 and PTCH1 cholesterol transporters and to H+-driven transporters of the RND family, enables tissue patterning activity of the lipid-modified Hedgehog protein by releasing it from tightly-localized sites of embryonic expression. A 2.5 [A] resolution cryo-EM structure of DISP1 revealed three Na+ ions coordinated within a channel that traverses its transmembrane domain. This channel and Na+-binding are disrupted in DISP1-NNN (3.4 [A] resolution), a variant with isosteric substitutions for three intramembrane aspartates that each coordinate and neutralize charge for one of the three Na+ ions. DISP1-NNN and other variants that singly disrupt the Na+ sites retain binding to the lipid-modified Hedgehog protein, but most fail to export Hedgehog. The Sonic hedgehog signal (ShhN) interacts with the DISP1 extracellular domains (2.7 [A] complex structure), including an unusual extended DISP1 arm, at a location well above the membrane. Variability analysis reveals a dynamic series of DISP1 conformations, only a restricted subset of which appear to bind ShhN. The bound and unbound DISP1 conformations display distinct Na+ site occupancies; these differences, in conjunction with the unusual locations of certain lipids bound to DISP1, suggest a mechanism by which transmembrane Na+ flux may power extraction of the lipid-linked Hedgehog signal from the membrane, thus enabling its tissue patterning activity. The Na+-coordinating residues resolved in our DISP1 structures are wholly or partly conserved in some of the other metazoan RND family members, such as PTCH1 and NPC1, suggesting the utilization of Na+ flux to power their conformationally-driven activities.",

    "abstract": "Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant steroid hormones that are known to regulate cell division and stress response. We used a systems biology approach to integrate multi-omic datasets and unravel the molecular signaling events of BR response in Arabidopsis. We profiled the levels of 32,549 transcripts, 9,035 protein groups, and 26,950 phosphorylation sites from Arabidopsis seedlings treated with brassinolide (BL, most active BR) for six different lengths of time. We then constructed a network inference pipeline called Spatiotemporal Clustering and Inference of Omics Networks (SC-ION) that was able to integrate these multi-omic data into one, cohesive regulatory network. Our network illustrates the signaling cascade of BR response, starting with kinase-substrate phosphorylation and ending with transcriptional regulation. We used our network predictions to identify putative, relevant phosphorylation sites on the TF BRI1-EMS-SUPPRESSOR 1 (BES1); the importance of which we experimentally validated. Additionally, we identified an uncharacterized TF, which we named BRONTOSAURUS (BRON), that regulates cell division. Further, we show that bron mutant roots are hypersensitive to BL. Together, this work demonstrates the power of integrative network analysis applied to multiomic data and provides fundamental insights into the molecular signaling events occurring during BR response.",

    "abstract": "Differentiation is the process whereby a cell acquires a specific phenotype, by differential gene expression as a function of time. This is thought to result from the dynamical functioning of an underlying Gene Regulatory Network (GRN). The precise path from the stochastic GRN behavior to the resulting cell state is still an open question. In this work we propose to reduce a stochastic model of gene expression, where a cell is represented by a vector in a continuous space of gene expression, to a discrete coarse-grained model on a limited number of cell types. We develop analytical results and numerical tools to perform this reduction for a specific model characterizing the evolution of a cell by a system of piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMP). Solving a spectral problem, we find the explicit variational form of the rate function associated to a large deviations principle, for any number of genes. The resulting Lagrangian dynamics allows us to define a deterministic limit of which the basins of attraction can be identified to cellular types. In this context the quasipotential, describing the transitions between these basins in the weak noise limit, can be defined as the unique solution of an Hamilton-Jacobi equation under a particular constraint. We develop a numerical method for approximating the coarse-grained model parameters, and show its accuracy for a symmetric toggle-switch network. We deduce from the reduced model an approximation of the stationary distribution of the PDMP system, which appears as a Beta mixture. Altogether those results establish a rigorous frame for connecting GRN behavior to the resulting cellular behavior, including the calculation of the probability of jumps between cell types.",

    "abstract": "Extensive diversity has been identified in the human heavy chain immunoglobulin locus, including allelic variation, gene duplication, and insertion/deletion events. Several genes have been suggested to be deleted in many haplotypes. Such findings have commonly been based on inference of germline repertoire from data sets covering antibody heavy chain encoding transcripts. The inference process operate under conditions that may limit identification of genes transcribed at low levels. The presence of rare transcripts that would indicate the presence of poorly expressed alleles in haplotypes that otherwise appear to have deleted these genes has now been assessed. Alleles IGHV1-2*05, IGHV1-3*02, IGHV4-4*01, and IGHV7-4-1*01 were all identified as being expressed at very low levels from multiple haplotypes, haplotypes that by inference often appeared not to express these genes at all. These alleles harbor unusual sequence variants that may compromise the functionality of the encoded products. Transcripts of two of these alleles to a large degree do not encode a functional product, suggesting that these alleles might be non-functional. It is proposed that the functionality status of immunoglobulin genes should also include assessment of their ability to encode functional protein products.",

The changes of oviposition site preference must have accompanied this niche exploitation. In this study, we established an oviposition assay to investigate the effects of commensal microbes deposited by conspecific and heterospecific individuals, and showed that presence of microbes on the oviposition substrate enhances egg-laying of D. melanogaster and D. biarmipes, but discourages that of D. suzukii. This result suggests that a drastic change has taken place in the lineage leading to D. suzukii in how females respond to chemical cues produced by microbes. We also found that hardness of the substrate affects the response to microbial growth, indicating that mechanosensory stimuli interact with chemosensory invoked decisions to select or avoid oviposition sites.",

    "abstract": "Despite the economic importance of P utilization efficiency, information on genetic factors underlying this trait remains elusive. To address that, we performed a genome-wide association study in a spring wheat diversity panel ranging from landraces to elite varieties. We evaluated the phenotype variation for P utilization efficiency in controlled conditions and genotype variation using wheat 90K SNP array. Phenotype variables were transformed into a smaller set of uncorrelated principal components that captured the most important variation data. We identified two significant loci associated with both P utilization efficiency and the 1st principal component on chromosomes 3A and 4A: qPE1-3A and qPE2-4A. Annotation of genes at these loci revealed 53 wheat genes, among which 6 were identified in significantly enriched pathways. The expression pattern of these 6 genes indicated that TraesCS4A02G481800, involved in pyruvate metabolism and TCA cycle, had a significantly higher expression in the P efficient variety under limited P conditions. Further characterization of these loci and candidate genes can help stimulate P utilization efficiency in wheat.\n\nKEY MESSAGEWe report two new loci for P utilization efficiency on chromosomes 3A and 4A of wheat. The prioritized candidate genes at these loci can be investigated by molecular biology techniques to improve P efficiency in wheat and grass relatives.",

Cell death occurred in cells treated with nanorods and irradiated but not in cells with irradiation treatment alone. Cells treated with nanorods and irradiation had increased damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including increased expression of chaperone proteins human high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). This enhanced expression of DAMPs led to the activation of dendritic cells. Overall, this treatment approach is a rapid and highly specific method to eradicate tumor cells with simultaneous immunogenic cell death signaling, showing potential as a combination strategy for immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is primarily caused by traumatic social events and is characterized by intense fear and avoidance of socially enriched contexts. Formation of such intense social aversion requires learning of the association between trauma and originally neutral social stimuli. Acetylation of histones in response to learning is critical for long-term memory formation. Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) have emerged as powerful negative regulators of long-term memory formation. However, the lack of clarity in isoform and spatial specificity in HDAC function exists. Utilizing the social fear conditioning (SFC) as well as cued fear conditioning (CFC) paradigms, we aimed to functionally characterize the role of class I HDACs, especially HDAC1, in the regulation of aversive memories in social versus non-social contexts. Using cFos expression as a marker of cellular activity, we revealed that the lateral septum (LS) was specifically activated post-acquisition in socially fear conditioned (SFC+) mice. We further measured an increase in activity-inducing HDAC1 phosphorylation at serine residues within the septum of SFC+ mice during extinction of social fear. Pharmacological inhibition of HDAC1 within the LS facilitated, while viral overexpression of septal HDAC1 impaired extinction of social fear. Finally, we found that the abovementioned facilitation of extinction memory by HDAC1 inhibition was long-lasting and persists even after 30 days of extinction. Our results show that LS-HDAC1 is a key regulator of long-lasting social fear extinction, which points towards HDAC1 as a potential therapeutic target for SAD.",

    "abstract": "IQSEC2 is an X-linked gene which is associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), intellectual disability and epilepsy. IQSEC2 is a postsynaptic density protein, localized on excitatory synapses as part of the NMDA receptor complex and is suggested to play a role in AMPA receptor trafficking and mediation of long-term depression. Here, we present brain-wide structural volumetric and functional connectivity characterization in a novel mouse model with a missense mutation in the IQ domain of IQSEC2 (A350V). Using high-resolution structural and functional MRI, we show that animals with the A350V mutation display increased whole-brain volume which was further found to be specific to the cortex and hippocampus. Moreover, using a data-driven approach we demonstrate that A350V mice present alterations in structure-function relations of the frontal, auditory, and visual networks. Examination of these alterations revealed an increase in functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsomedial striatum. We also show that corticostriatal functional connectivity is correlated with individual variability in social behavior only in A350V mice, as assessed using the three-chamber social preference test. Our results at the systems-level bridge the impact of previously reported changes in AMPA receptor trafficking to network-level disruption and impaired social behavior. Further, the A350V mouse model recapitulates similarly reported brain-wide changes in other ASD mouse models, with substantially different cellular-level pathologies that nonetheless result in similar brain-wide alterations, suggesting that novel therapeutic approaches in ASD that result in systems-level rescue will be relevant to IQSEC2 mutations.\n\nSignificance StatementSeveral recent studies have characterized the changes in the organization of brain networks in animal models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Here we assessed the effect of an A350V missense mutation in the IQSEC2 gene, which is associated with ASD, on brain-wide functional connectivity and its relation to social behavior deficits in A350V mice relative to controls. We found that the A350V IQSEC2 model results in disrupted functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsomedial striatum. Critically, disrupted increased corticostriatal functional connectivity is predictive of individual variability in social interaction only in A350V mice implicating this pathway in the pathophysiology of the A350V IQSEC2 mutation.",
