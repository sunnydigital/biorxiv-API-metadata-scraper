    "abstract": "RNA structural elements occur in numerous single stranded (+)-sense RNA viruses. The stemloop 2 motif (s2m) is one such element with an unusually high degree of sequence conservation, being found in the 3 UTR in the genomes of many astroviruses, some picornaviruses and noroviruses, and a variety of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The evolutionary conservation and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic transcripts implicates a key role of s2m in the viral infection cycle. Our findings indicate that the element, while stably folded, can nonetheless be invaded and remodelled spontaneously by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that initiate pairing in exposed loops and trigger efficient sequence-specific RNA cleavage in reporter assays. ASOs also act to inhibit replication in an astrovirus replicon model system in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell culture. Our results thus permit us to suggest that the s2m element is a site of vulnerability readily targeted by ASOs, which show promise as anti-viral agents.",

    "abstract": "Peroxisomal Biogenesis Disorders (PBDs) are a class of inherited metabolic disorders with profound neurological and other phenotypes. The most severe PBDs are caused by mutations in peroxin genes, which result in nonfunctional peroxisomes typically through impaired protein import. In order to better understand the molecular causes of Zellweger Spectrum Disease (ZSD) -the most severe PBDs -, we investigated the fate of peroxisomal mRNAs and proteins in ZSD model systems. We found that loss of peroxisomal import has no effect on peroxin mRNA expression or translational efficiency. Instead, peroxin proteins--still produced at high levels-- aberrantly accumulate on the mitochondrial membrane, impairing respiration and ATP generation. Finally, we rescued mitochondrial function in fibroblasts derived from human patients with ZSD by overexpressing ATAD1, an AAA-ATPase that functions in mitochondrial quality control. These findings might provide a new focus of PBD therapies in supporting quality control pathways that protect mitochondrial function.",

    "abstract": "In birds, males are the homogametic sex (ZZ) and females the heterogametic sex (ZW), and primary sex determination is thought to depend on a sex chromosome gene dosage mechanism. Previous studies have suggested that the most likely sex-determinant is the Z chromosome gene DMRT1 (Doublesex and Mab-3 Related Transcription factor 1). To clarify this issue, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 based mono-allelic targeting approach and sterile surrogate hosts to generate birds with targeted mutations in the DMRT1 gene. The resulting chromosomally male (ZZ) chicken with a single functional copy of DMRT1 developed ovaries in place of testes, demonstrating the avian sex determining mechanism is based on DMRT1 dosage. These ZZ ovaries expressed typical female markers and showed clear evidence of follicular development. However, these ZZ adult birds with an ovary in place of testes were indistinguishable in appearance to wild type adult males, supporting the concept of cell-autonomous sex identity (CASI) in birds. In experiments where oestrogen synthesis was blocked in control ZW embryos, the resulting gonads developed as testes. In contrast, if oestrogen synthesis was blocked in ZW embryos that lacked DMRT1, the gonads invariably adopted an ovarian fate. Our analysis shows that DMRT1 is the key sex determination switch in birds and that it is essential for testis development, but that production of oestrogen is also a key factor in primary sex determination in chickens, and that this production is linked to DMRT1 expression.",

    "abstract": "Angiopoietin 1 and 2 (Ang1 and Ang2) modulate angiogenesis and vascular homeostasis through engagement of their very similar F-domain modules with the Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase on endothelial cells. Despite this similarity in the underlying receptor binding interaction, the two angiopoietins have opposite effects: Ang1 induces phosphorylation of protein kinase B (AKT), strengthens cell-cell junctions and enhances endothelial cell survival while Ang2 antagonizes these effects1-4. To investigate the molecular basis for the opposing effects, we examined the protein kinase activation and morphological phenotypes produced by a series of computationally designed protein scaffolds presenting the Ang1 F-domain in a wide range of valencies and geometries. We find two broad phenotypic classes distinguished by the number of presented F-domains: scaffolds presenting 4 F-domains have Ang2 like activity, upregulating pFAK and pERK but not pAKT, and failing to induce cell migration and tube formation, while scaffolds presenting 6 or more F-domains have Ang1 like activity, upregulating pAKT and inducing migration and tube formation. The scaffolds with 8 or more F-domains display superagonist activity, producing stronger phenotypes at lower concentrations than Ang1. When examined in vivo, superagonist icosahedral self-assembling nanoparticles caused significant revascularization in hemorrhagic brains after a controlled cortical impact injury.",

    "abstract": "It is commonly believed that B cells play no role in cancer immune surveillance. However, this conclusion is based on studies using only a single B cell-deficient mouse strain, muMT mice, which does not show increased tumorigenesis compared with wild-type (WT) mice. In this study, we demonstrate a critical role for B cells in anti-tumor immunity and identify the cellular mechanisms that make muMT mice a special case. First, we replicate previous findings using a melanoma model in muMT mice. Then, we show that in muMT mice, B-cell deficiency is compensated for by a significant increase in another potent anti-tumor cell type, Type-1 interferon (IFN I)-producing plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), resulting in normative anti-tumor responses. Depleting pDCs in muMT mice resulted in a significant increase in tumor size and burden. Conversely, adoptive transfer of antibodies from naive WT serum into pDC-depleted muMT mice significantly decreased the tumor load to WT levels. Additionally, a B cell antibody repertoire-deficient mouse strain, IghelMD4 mice, showed a 3-fold increase in tumors relative to WT mice. Overall, these findings indicate the need for a diverse antibody repertoire for early neoplastic cell recognition and the critical role B cells play in anti-cancer immunity.",

    "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma, an oncofusion-driven primary bone tumor, can occur in the setting of various germline mutations in DNA damage repair pathway genes. We recently reported our discovery of a germline mutation in the DNA damage repair protein BARD1 (BRCA1-associated RING domain-1) in a patient with Ewing sarcoma. BARD1 is recruited to the site of DNA double stranded breaks via the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein and plays a critical role in DNA damage response pathways including homologous recombination. PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are effective against Ewing sarcoma cells in vitro, though have demonstrated limited success in clinical trials to date. In order to assess the impact of BARD1 loss on Ewing sarcoma sensitivity to PARP inhibitor therapy, we generated the novel PSaRC318 patient-derived Ewing tumor cell from our patient with a germline BARD1 mutation and then analyzed the response of these cells to PARPi. We demonstrate that PSaRC318 cells are sensitive to PARP inhibition and by testing the effect of BARD1 depletion in additional Ewing sarcoma cell lines, we confirm that loss of BARD1 enhances PARPi sensitivity. In certain malignancies, DNA damage can activate the IRF1 (interferon response factor 1) immunoregulatory pathway, and the activation of this pathway can drive immunosuppression through upregulation of the immune checkpoint protein PD-L1. In order to determine the ability of PARPi to alter Ewing tumor immunoregulation, we evaluated whether PARPi results in upregulation of the IRF1-PDL1 pathway. Indeed, we now demonstrate that PARPi leads to increased PD-L1 expression in Ewing sarcoma. Together, these data thus far suggest that while Ewing tumors harboring germline mutations in DNA damage repair proteins may in respond to PARPi in vitro, in vivo benefit of PARPi may only be demonstrated when counteracting the immunosuppressive effects of DNA damage by concurrently targeting immune checkpoint proteins.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation is a key regulatory mechanism involved in nearly every eukaryotic cellular process. Increasingly sensitive mass spectrometry approaches have identified hundreds of thousands of phosphorylation sites but the functions of a vast majority of these sites remain unknown, with fewer than 5% of sites currently assigned a function. To increase our understanding of functional protein phosphorylation we developed an approach for identifying the phosphorylation-dependence of protein assemblies in a systematic manner. A combination of non-specific protein phosphatase treatment, size-exclusion chromatography, and mass spectrometry allowed us to identify changes in protein interactions after the removal of phosphate modifications. With this approach we were able to identify 316 proteins involved in phosphorylation-sensitive interactions. We recovered known phosphorylation-dependent interactors such as the FACT complex and spliceosome, as well as identified novel interactions such as the tripeptidyl peptidase TPP2 and the supraspliceosome component ZRANB2. More generally, we find phosphorylation-dependent interactors to be strongly enriched for RNA-binding proteins, providing new insight into the role of phosphorylation in RNA binding. By searching directly for phosphorylated amino acid residues in mass spectrometry data, we identified the likely regulatory phosphosites on ZRANB2 and FACT complex subunit SSRP1. This study provides both a method and resource for obtaining a better understanding of the role of phosphorylation in native macromolecular assemblies.",
