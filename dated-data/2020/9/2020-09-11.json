    "abstract": "Understanding the physiological processes that underpin primate performance is key if we are to assess how a primate might respond when navigating new and changing environments. Given the connection between an animals ability to thermoregulate and the changing demands of its thermal environment, increasing attention is being devoted to the study of thermoregulatory processes as a means to assess primate performance. Infrared thermography can be used to record the body surface temperatures of free-ranging animals. However, some uncertainty remains as to how these measurements can be used to approximate core body temperature. Here, we use data collected from wild vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) to examine the relationship between infrared body surface, core body, and local climate, to determine to what extent surface temperatures reflect core body temperature. While we report a positive association between surface and core body temperature - a finding that has previously been used to justify the use of surface temperature measurements as a proxy for core temperature regulation - when we controlled for the effect of the local climate in our analyses, this relationship was no longer observed. That is, body surface temperatures were solely predicted by local climate, and not core body temperatures, suggesting that surface temperatures tell us more about the environment a primate is in, and less about the thermal status of its body core in that environment. Despite the advantages of a non-invasive means to detect and record animal temperatures, infrared thermography alone cannot be used to approximate core body temperature in wild primates.",

    "abstract": "Efficient photosynthesis requires a balance of ATP and NADPH production/consumption in chloroplasts and the exportation of reducing equivalents from chloroplasts is important for balancing stromal ATP/NADPH ratio. Here we showed that the overexpression of purple acid phosphatase 2 on the outer membranes of chloroplasts and mitochondria can streamline the production and consumption of reducing equivalents in these two organelles, respectively. A higher capacity of consumption of reducing equivalents in mitochondria can indirectly help chloroplasts to balance the ATP/NADPH ratio in stroma and recycle NADP+, the electron acceptors of the linear electron flow. A higher rate of ATP and NADPH production from the linear electron flow, a higher capacity of carbon fixation by the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle and a greater consumption of NADH in mitochondria, enhance photosynthesis in the chloroplasts, ATP production in the mitochondria, sucrose synthesis in the cytosol, and eventually boosting plant growth and seed yields in the overexpression lines.",

    "abstract": "ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) is a key transcription factor which promotes photomorphogenesis by regulating complex downstream growth programs. Previous studies suggest that the regulation of HY5 mainly depends on the CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1 (COP1) - SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME A-105 (SPA) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, which degrades positively acting transcription factors of light signaling to repress photomorphogenesis in the dark. SPA proteins function not only as a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex but also as a kinase of PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR1 (PIF1) through its N-terminal kinase domain. Here, we show that HY5 is a new substrate of SPA1 kinase. SPA1 can directly phosphorylate HY5 in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrate that unphosphorylated HY5 strongly interacts with both COP1 and SPA1 than phosphorylated HY5, is the preferred substrate for degradation, whereas phosphorylated HY5 is more stable in the dark. In addition, unphosphorylated HY5 actively binds to the target promoters, and is physiologically more active form. Consistently, the transgenic plants expressing unphosphorylated mutant of HY5 displays enhanced photomorphogenesis. Collectively, our study revealed that SPA1 fine-tunes the stability and the activity of HY5 to regulate photomorphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Zinc (Zn) is a key micronutrient. In humans, Zn deficiency is a common nutritional disorder, and most people acquire dietary Zn from eating plants. In plants, Zn deficiency can decrease plant growth and yield. Understanding Zn homeostasis in plants can improve agriculture and human health. While root Zn transporters in plat model species have been characterized in detail, comparatively little is known about shoot processes controlling Zn concentrations and spatial distribution. Previous work showed that Zn hyperaccumulator species such as Arabidopsis halleri accumulate Zn and other metals in leaf trichomes. The model species Arabidopsis thaliana is a non-accumulating plant, and to date there is no systematic study regarding Zn accumulation in A. thaliana trichomes. Here, we used Synchrotron X-Ray Fluorescence mapping to show that Zn accumulates at the base of trichomes of A. thaliana, as had seen previously for hyperaccumulators. Using transgenic and natural accessions of A. thaliana that vary in bulk leaf Zn concentration, we demonstrated that higher leaf Zn increases total Zn found at the base of trichome cells. Furthermore, our data suggests that Zn accumulates in the trichome apoplast, likely associated with the cell wall. Our data indicates that Zn accumulation in trichomes is a function of the Zn status of the plant, and provides the basis for future studies on a genetically tractable plant species aiming at understanding the molecular steps involved in Zn spatial distribution in leaves.",

    "abstract": "The interplay between nutrient-induced signaling and metabolism plays an important role in maintaining homeostasis and its malfunction has been implicated in many different human diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cancer and neurological disorders. Therefore, unravelling the role of nutrients as signaling molecules and metabolites as well as their interconnectivity may provide a deeper understanding of how these conditions occur. Both signalling and metabolism have been extensively studied using various systems biology approaches. However, they are mainly studied individually and in addition current models lack both the complexity of the dynamics and the effects of the crosstalk in the signaling system. To gain a better understanding of the interconnectivity between nutrient signaling and metabolism, we developed a hybrid model, combining Boolean model, describing the signalling layer and the enzyme constraint model accounting for metabolism using a regulatory network as a link. The model was capable of reproducing the regulatory effects that are associated with the Crabtree effect and glucose repression. We show that using this methodology one can investigat intrinsically different systems, such as signaling and metabolism, in the same model and gain insight into how the interplay between them can have non-trivial effects by showing a connection between Snf1 signaling and chronological lifespan by the regulation of NDE and NDI usage in respiring conditions. In addition, the model showed that during fermentation, enzyme utilization is the more important factor governing the protein allocation, while in low glucose conditions robustness and control is prioritized.\n\nAuthor summaryElucidating the complex relationship between nutrient-induced signaling and metabolism represents a key in understanding the onset of many different human diseases like obesity, type 3 diabetes, cancer and many neurological disorders. In this work we proposed a hybrid modeling approach, combining Boolean representation of singaling pathways, like Snf11, TORC1 and PKA with the enzyme constrained model of metabolism linking them via the regulatory network. This allowed us to improve individual model predictions and elucidate how single components in the dynamic signaling layer affect the steady-state metabolism. The model has been tested under respiration and fermentation, reveling novel connections and further reproducing the regulatory effects that are associated with the Crabtree effect and glucose repression. Finally, we show a connection between Snf1 signaling and chronological lifespan by the regulation of NDE and NDI usage in respiring conditions.",

    "abstract": "Several previous attempts have been made to divide the human amygdala into smaller subregions based on the unique functional properties of the subregions. Although these attempts have provided valuable insight into the functional heterogeneity in this structure, the possibility that spatial patterns of functional characteristics can quickly change over time has been neglected in previous studies. In the present study, we explicitly account for the dynamic nature of amygdala activity. Our goal was not only to develop another parcellation method but also to augment existing methods with novel information about amygdala subdivisions. We performed state-specific amygdala parcellation using resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). RsfMRI data from 102 subjects were acquired with a 3T Trio Siemens scanner. We analyzed values of several RQA measures across all voxels in the amygdala and found two amygdala subdivisions, the ventrolateral (VL) and dorsomedial (DM) subdivisions, that differ with respect to one of the RQA measures, Shannons entropy of diagonal lines. Compared to the DM subdivision, the VL subdivision can be characterized by a higher value of entropy. The results suggest that VL activity is determined and influenced by more brain structures than is DM activity. To assess the biological validity of the obtained subdivisions, we compared them with histological atlases and currently available parcellations based on structural connectivity patterns (Anatomy Probability Maps) and cytoarchitectonic features (SPM Anatomy toolbox). Moreover, we examined their cortical and subcortical functional connectivity. The obtained results are similar to those previously reported on parcellation performed on the basis of structural connectivity patterns. Functional connectivity analysis revealed that the VL subdivision has strong connections to several cortical areas, whereas the DM subdivision is mainly connected to subcortical regions. This finding suggests that the VL subdivision corresponds to the basolateral subdivision of the amygdala (BLA), while the DM subdivision has some characteristics typical of the centromedial amygdala (CMA). The similarity in functional connectivity patterns between the VL subdivision and BLA, as well as between the DM subdivision and CMA, confirm the utility of our parcellation method. Overall, the study shows that parcellation based on BOLD signal dynamics is a powerful tool for identifying distinct functional systems within the amygdala. This tool might be useful for future research on functional brain organization.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA new method for parcellation of the human amygdala was developed\nC_LIO_LIThe ventrolateral and dorsomedial subdivisions of the amygdala were revealed\nC_LIO_LIThe two subdivisions correspond to the anatomically defined regions of the amygdala\nC_LIO_LIThe two subdivisions differ with respect to values of entropy\nC_LIO_LIA new parcellation method provides novel information about amygdala subdivisions\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "When exploring new environments animals form spatial memories that are updated with experience and retrieved upon re-exposure to the same environment. The hippocampus is thought to support these memory processes, but how this is achieved by different subnetworks such as CA1 and CA3 remains unclear. To understand how hippocampal spatial representations emerge and evolve during familiarization, we performed 2-photon calcium imaging in mice running in new virtual environments and compared the trial-to-trial dynamics of place cells in CA1 and CA3 over days. We find that place fields in CA1 emerge rapidly but tend to shift backwards from trial-to-trial and remap upon re-exposure to the environment a day later. In contrast, place fields in CA3 emerge gradually but show more stable trial-to-trial and day-to-day dynamics. These results reflect different roles in CA1 and CA3 in spatial memory processing during familiarization to new environments and constrain the potential mechanisms that support them.",

    "abstract": "As part of the maternal adaptations to pregnancy, mice show a rapid, profound reduction in voluntary running wheel activity (RWA) as soon as pregnancy is achieved. Here, we evaluate the hypothesis that prolactin, one of the first hormones to change secretion pattern following mating, is involved in driving this suppression of physical activity levels during pregnancy. We show that prolactin can acutely suppress RWA in virgin female mice, and that conditional deletion of prolactin receptors (Prlr) from either all forebrain neurons or from GABA neurons prevented the early pregnancy-induced suppression of RWA. Deletion of Prlr specifically from the medial preoptic area, a brain region associated with multiple homeostatic and behavioural roles including parental behaviour, completely abolished the early pregnancy-induced suppression of RWA. Our data demonstrate a key role for prolactin in suppressing voluntary physical activity during early pregnancy, highlighting a novel biological basis for reduced physical activity in pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Survival in the natural environment often relies on an animals ability to quickly and accurately predict the trajectories of moving objects. Motion prediction is primarily understood in the context of translational motion, but the environment contains other types of behaviorally salient motion, such as that produced by approaching or receding objects. However, the neural mechanisms that detect and predictively encode these motion types remain unclear. Here, we address these questions in the macaque monkey retina. We report that four of the parallel output pathways in the primate retina encode predictive information about the future trajectory of moving objects. Predictive encoding occurs both for translational motion and for higher-order motion patterns found in natural vision. Further, predictive encoding of these motion types is nearly optimal with transmitted information approaching the theoretical limit imposed by the stimulus itself. These findings argue that natural selection has emphasized encoding of information that is relevant for anticipating future properties of the environment.",

Although the practical utility of VPL was once thought to be limited by its specificity to the precise stimuli used during training, more recent work has shown that such specificity can be overcome with appropriate training protocols. In contrast, relatively little is known about the extent to which VPL exhibits motor specificity. Indeed, previous studies have shown that training paradigms that require one type of response (e.g., a button press) do not necessarily transfer to those that require a different response (e.g., a mouse movement). In this work, we have examined the effector specificity of VPL by training observers on tasks that maintain the same visual stimuli and task structure, but that require different effectors to indicate the response. We find that, in these conditions, VPL transfers fully between manual and oculomotor responses. These results are consistent with the idea that VPL entails the learning of a decision rule that can generalize across effectors.",

Bayesian theory that takes into account the memory for the events order is compatible with the experimental data, in particular in terms of the effect of order on absolute time reports.

All Sez6 family members contain 2-3 CUB domains and 5 complement control protein (CCP) domains, suggesting that they may be involved in complement regulation. We show that all Sez6 family members inhibit C3 deposition by the classical and alterative pathways with varying degrees of efficacy. For the classical pathway, Sez6 is a strong inhibitor, Sez6L2 is a moderate inhibitor, and Sez6L is a weak inhibitor. Using Sez6L2 as the representative family member, we show that it specifically deactivates C3 convertases by accelerating the decay or dissociation of the C3 convertase components. Sez6L2 also deactivates C3 convertases of the alternative pathway by serving as a cofactor for Factor I to facilitate the cleavage of C3b. However, Sez6L2 has no cofactor activity toward C4b. In summary, the Sez6 family are novel complement regulators that inhibit C3 convertases.",

Due to the low temporal resolution, however, BOLD signals do not allow the exploration of spectral properties of the brain dynamics over different frequency bands which are known to be important in cognitive processes. Recent studies using imaging tools with a high temporal resolution has made it possible to explore the correlation between the regions at multiple frequency bands. These studies introduce the frequency as a new dimension over which the functional networks change, enabling brain networks to transmit multiplex of information at any time. In this computational study, we explore the functional connectivity at different frequency ranges and highlight the role of the distance between the nodes in their correlation. We run the generalized Kuramoto model with delayed interactions on top of the brains connectome and show that how the transmission delay and the strength of the connections, affect the correlation between the pair of nodes over different frequency bands.",

    "abstract": "Activity-dependent structural plasticity at the synapse requires specific changes in the neuronal transcriptome. While much is known about the role of coding elements in this process, the role of the long-noncoding transcriptome remains elusive. Here we report the discovery of an intronic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)--termed ADEPTR--whose expression is upregulated and is synaptically transported in a cAMP/PKA-dependent manner in hippocampal neurons, independent of its protein-coding host gene. Loss of ADEPTR function suppresses activity-dependent changes in synaptic transmission and structural plasticity of dendritic spines. Mechanistically, dendritic localization of ADEPTR is mediated by molecular motor protein Kif2A. ADEPTR physically binds to actin-scaffolding regulators Ankyrin (AnkB) and Spectrin (Sptn1) and is required for their dendritic localization. Taken together, this study demonstrates that ADEPTR regulates the dendritic Spectrin-Ankyrin network for structural plasticity at the synapse and illuminates a novel role for lncRNAs at the synapse.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe have uncovered an intronic long noncoding RNA that is synaptically transported in a cAMP-dependent manner and is linked to cytoskeletal components of structural plasticity in hippocampal neurons.",

    "abstract": "Dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) is a key component of the global geochemical sulfur cycle that is a secondary metabolite produced in large quantities by marine phytoplankton and utilized as an osmoprotectant. Bacterial DMSP lyases convert DMSP to the climate active gas dimethylsulfide (DMS). Whether marine bacteria can also accumulate DMSP as an osmoprotectant to maintain the turgor pressure of the cell in response to changes in external osmolarity remains unknown. The marine halophile Vibrio parahaemolyticus, contains at least six osmolyte transporters, four betaine carnitine choline transport (BCCT) carriers BccT1-BccT4 and two ABC-family ProU transporters. In this study, we showed that DMSP is used as an osmoprotectant by V. parahaemolyticus and several other Vibrio species including V. cholerae and V. vulnificus. Using a V. parahaemolyticus proU double mutant, we demonstrated that these ABC transporters are not required for DMSP uptake. However, a bccT null mutant lacking all four BCCTs had a growth defect compared to wild type in high salt media supplemented with DMSP. Using bccT triple mutants, possessing only one functional BCCT, in growth pattern assays, we identified two BCCT-family transporters, BccT1 and BccT2 are carriers of DMSP. Vibrio cholerae and V. vulnificus, only contain a homolog of BccT3 and functional complementation in Escherichia coli MKH13 showed only V. cholerae BccT3 could transport DMSP. In V. vulnificus strains, we identified and characterized an additional BCCT transporter that was also a carrier for DMSP. Phylogenetic analysis uncovered at least 11 distinct BCCT transporters among members of the Harveyi clade, with some species having up to 9 BCCTs as exemplified by V. jasicida.\n\nImportanceDMSP is present in the marine environment, produced in large quantities by marine phytoplankton as an osmoprotectant, and is an important component of the global geosulfur cycle. The bacterial family Vibrionaceae is comprised of marine species, many of which are halophiles such as V. parahaemolyticus, which can utilize a wide range of osmolytes and possesses at least six transporters for the uptake of these compounds. Here, we demonstrated that V. parahaemolyticus and other Vibrio species can accumulate DMSP as an osmoprotectant and show that the BCCT family transporters were required. DMSP was transported by four different BCCT transporters; BccT1, BccT2, BccT3 and BccT5 depending on the species. Bioinformatics and phylogenetics demonstrated that Vibrio species contain a large number of BCCTs and that many of these are associated with different metabolic pathways.",

    "abstract": "The nitroimidazole pro-drugs delamanid and pretomanid comprise one of only two new antimicrobial classes approved to treat tuberculosis (TB) in 50 years. Prior in vitro studies suggest a relatively low barrier to nitroimidazole resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but clinical evidence is limited to date. We selected pretomanid-resistant M. tuberculosis mutants in two mouse models of TB using a range of pretomanid doses. The frequency of spontaneous resistance was approximately 10-5 CFU. Whole genome sequencing of 161 resistant isolates from 47 mice revealed 99 unique mutations, 91% of which occurred in 1 of 5 genes previously associated with nitroimidazole activation and resistance: fbiC (56%), fbiA (15%), ddn (12%), fgd (4%) and fbiB (4%). Nearly all mutations were unique to a single mouse and not previously identified. The remaining 9% of resistant mutants harbored mutations in Rv2983, a gene not previously associated with nitroimidazole resistance but recently shown to be a guanylyltransferase necessary for cofactor F420 synthesis. Most mutants exhibited high-level resistance to pretomanid and delamanid, although Rv2983 and fbiB mutants exhibited high-level pretomanid resistance, but relatively small changes in delamanid susceptibility. Complementing an Rv2983 mutant with wild-type Rv2983 restored susceptibility to pretomanid and delamanid. By quantifying intracellular F420 and its precursor Fo in overexpressing and loss-of-function mutants, we provide further evidence that Rv2983 is necessary for F420 biosynthesis. Finally, Rv2983 mutants and other F420H2-deficient mutants displayed hypersusceptibility to some antibiotics and to concentrations of malachite green found in solid media used to isolate and propagate mycobacteria from clinical samples.",

    "abstract": "The composition and diversity of animal microbiomes is shaped by a variety of factors, many of them interacting, such as host traits, the environment, and biogeography. Hybrid zones, in which the ranges of two host species meet and hybrids are found, provide natural experiments for determining the drivers of microbiome communities, but have not been well studied in marine environments. Here, we analysed the composition of the symbiont community in two deep-sea, Bathymodiolus mussel species along their known distribution range at hydrothermal vents on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, with a focus on the hybrid zone where they interbreed. In-depth metagenomic analyses of the sulphur-oxidising symbionts of 30 mussels from the hybrid zone, at a resolution of single nucleotide polymorphism analyses of [~]2500 orthologous genes, revealed that parental and hybrid mussels have genetically indistinguishable symbionts. While host genetics does not appear to affect symbiont composition in these mussels, geographic location of the mussels on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge explained 45 % of symbiont genetic variability based on redundancy analyses. We hypothesize that geographic structuring of the free-living symbiont population plays a major role in driving the composition of the microbiome in these deep-sea mussels.",

Dysregulation of gene ontology (GO)-defined systems was measured using the Mahalanobis distance (DM), a measure of multivariant aberrance. We expected many weak positive DM-age correlations, indicating loss of homeostatic control. Out of the 5180 GO terms tested, we found 230 systems that replicated in at least three datasets. Surprisingly, all 230 systems showed negative DM-age correlations, in contrast to findings with clinical biomarkers. These systems were mostly metabolic functions related to small molecules and nitrogen compounds, transport functions, biosynthetic processes and response to stress functions. These results suggest a loss of responsiveness in these gene expression systems during the aging process, and contrast to some previous literature showing increased gene expression heterogeneity with age.",

    "abstract": "Heart regeneration after myocardial infarction remains challenging due to scar and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Here, we show that zebrafish blastema regeneration can effectively resalvage the wound myocardium and blood clot through cytoplasmic exocytosis and nuclear reorganization. The cell remodeling process are also visualized by spatiotemporal expression of three core blastema genes: alpha-SMA- which marks for fibrogenesis, Flk1for angiogenesis/hematopoiesis, Pax3a for remusculogensis, and by characteristic chromatin depositions of H3K9Ac/H3K9Me3. Genome-wide enhancer identification links the depositions of the two histone marks to the chromatin state and these three core blastema cell phenotypes. When the blastema subcellular fractions are introduced into the cultured zebrafish embryonic fibroblasts the altered transcription profile is comparable to the blastema transcription in terms of extracellular matrix structural constituent, vasculature development/angiogenesis, and cardiac muscle regeneration. From the subcellular fractions we identify 15 extracellular components and intermediate filaments, and show that introduction of human Krt5 and noggin peptides conversely regulate PAC2 cells F-actin reorganization, chromatin depositions of H3K9Ac/ H3K9Me3 and phosphorylation of Smad, which are accompanied by characteristic transcriptions of bmp, bmp4, three core blastema genes as well as specific histone acetylation/methylation-related genes. Collectively, this study establishes a new Krt5-BMP4 mechanosignaling cascade that links extracellular molecules to chromatin modifications and regulates blastema cell remodeling, thus providing mechanistic insights into the mesoderm-derived blastema regeneration and underlining a therapy strategy for myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "Exocrine pancreatic damage is a common complication of cystic fibrosis (CF), which can significantly debilitate the quality of life and life expectancy of CF patients. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has a major role in pancreatic ductal ion secretion, however, it presumably has an influence on intracellular signaling as well. Here we describe in multiple model systems, including iPSC-derived human pancreatic organoids from CF patients, that the activity of PMCA4 is impaired by the decreased expression of CFTR in ductal cells. The regulation of PMCA4, which colocalizes and physically interacts with CFTR on the apical membrane of the ductal cells, is dependent on the calmodulin binding ability of CFTR. Moreover, CFTR seems to be involved in the process of the apical recruitment of calmodulin, which enhances its role in calcium signaling and homeostasis. Sustained intracellular Ca2+ elevation in CFTR KO cells undermined the mitochondrial function and increased apoptosis. Based on these, the prevention of sustained intracellular Ca2+ overload may improve the exocrine pancreatic function and may have a potential therapeutic aspect in CF.",

To facilitate future studies of the epigenetic underpinnings of aging effects in the female reproductive axis, several DNA methylation-based biomarkers of aging (epigenetic clocks) for bovine oocytes are presented. One such clock was germane to only oocytes, while a dual-tissue clock was highly predictive of age in both oocytes and blood. Dual species clocks that apply to both humans and cattle were also developed and evaluated. These epigenetic clocks can be used to accurately estimate the chronological age of the oocyte donor. Both epigenetic clock studies and epigenome wide association studies revealed that blood and oocytes differ substantially with respect aging and the underlying epigenetic signatures that potentially influence the aging process. The rate of epigenetic aging was found to be slower in oocytes compared to blood, however, oocytes appeared to begin at an older epigenetic age. The epigenetic clocks for oocytes are expected to address questions in the field of reproductive aging, including the central question: how to slow aging of oocytes.",

To understand the molecular basis of this process, we analyzed the progressing transcriptomes of early male and female germ cells at the single-cell level between germline specification and coalescence with somatic gonadal cells. Our data comprehensively covered zygotic activation in the germline genome, and analyses on genes that exhibit germline-restricted expression revealed that polymerase pausing and differential RNA stability are important mechanisms that establish gene expression differences between the germline and soma. In addition, we observed an immediate bifurcation between the male and female germ cells as zygotic transcription begins. The main difference between the two sexes is an elevation in X chromosome expression in females relative to males signifying incomplete dosage compensation with a few select genes exhibiting even higher expression increases. These indicate that the male program is the default mode in the germline that is driven to female development with a second X chromosome.",

    "abstract": "AimTo identify functional traits that best predict community assembly without knowing the driving environmental factors.\n\nMethodsWe propose a new method that is based on the correlation r(XY) between two matrices of potential community composition: matrix X is fuzzy-weighted by trait similarities of species, and matrix Y is derived by Beals smoothing using the probabilities of species co-occurrences. Since matrix X is based on one or more traits, r(XY) measures how well the traits used for fuzzy-weighting reflect the observed co-occurrence patterns. We developed an optimization algorithm that identifies those traits that maximize this correlation, together with an appropriate permutational test for significance. Using metacommunity data generated by a stochastic, individual-based, spatially explicit model, we assessed the type I error and the power of our method across different simulation scenarios, varying environmental filtering parameters, number of traits and trait correlation structures. We then applied the method to real-world community and trait data of dry calcareous grassland communities across Germany to identify, out of 49 traits, the combination of traits that maximizes r(XY).\n\nResultsThe method correctly identified the relevant traits involved in the community assembly mechanisms specified in simulations. It had high power and accurate type I error and was robust against confounding aspects related to interactions between environmental factors, strength of limiting factors, and correlation among traits. In the grassland dataset, the method identified five traits that best explained community assembly. These traits reflected the size and the leaf economics spectrum, which are related to succession and resource supply, factors that may not be always measured in real-world situations.\n\nConclusionsOur method successfully identified the relevant traits mediating community assembly driven by environmental factors which may be hidden for not being measured or accessible at the spatial or temporal scale of the study.",

Furthermore, we provide a new framework to infer the time since admixture using unphased data.

We found that 1) the genomes of Akkermansia formed 4 species (including 2 candidate species) with distinct interspecies similarity and differed genomic characteristics, and 2) the population of A. muciniphila was structured by 3 previously identified phylogroups (Amuc I, II, and III) referring to 1,132 genomes and 1 new phylogroup (defined as Amuc IV) that contained 62 genomes. Amuc III was presented in Chinese population and Amuc IV was mainly distributed in western populations. A large number of gene of functions, pathways, and carbohydrate active enzymes that specifically associated to phylogroups. Our findings based on over a thousand genomes strengthened the previous knowledge and provided new insights into the population structure and ecology of Akkermansia in human gut.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic AMP is a ubiquitous second messenger used to transduce intracellular signals from a variety of Gs-coupled receptors. Compartmentalisation of protein intermediates within the cAMP signaling pathway underpins receptor-specific responses. The cAMP effector proteins protein-kinase A and EPAC are found in complexes that also contain phosphodiesterases whose presence ensures a coordinated cellular response to receptor activation events. Popeye proteins are the most recent class of cAMP effectors to be identified and have crucial roles in cardiac pacemaking and conduction. We report the first observation that Popeye proteins exist in complexes with members of the PDE4 family in cardiac myocytes thus restricting cAMP signaling. We show that POPDC1 preferentially binds the PDE4A sub-family via a specificity motif in the PDE4 UCR1 region and that PDE4s bind to the Popeye domain of POPDC1 in a region known to be susceptible to a mutation that causes human disease. Using a cell-permeable disruptor peptide that displaces the POPDC1-PDE4 complex we show that PDE4 activity localized to POPDC1 is essential to maintain action potential duration in beating cardiac myocytes.",

    "abstract": "Identification, visualization and quantitation of cardiolipin (CL) in biological membranes is of great interest due to important structural and physiological roles of this lipid. Selective fluorescent detection of CL using non-covalently bound fluorophore TTAPE-Me (1,1,2,2-tetrakis[4-(2-trimethylammonioethoxy)-phenylethene) has been recently proposed. However, this dye was only tested on wild-type mitochondria or liposomes containing neglegible amounts of other anionic lipids, such as PG and PS. No clear preference of TTAPE-Me for binding to CL compared to PG and PS was found in our experiments. The shapes of the emission spectra for these anionic phospholipids were also found to be indistinguishable. Our experiments and complementary molecular dynamics simulations suggest that fluorescence intensity of TTAPE-Me is regulated by dynamic equilibrium between emitting dye, bound to anionic lipids by means of unspecific electrostatic attraction, and non-emitting dye aggregates in aqueous solution. Therefore, TTAPE-Me is not suitable for detection, visualization and localization of CL in the presence of PS and PG present in physiological amounts in the membranes of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells, respectively.",

During oral delivery, NMN is exposed to the gut microbiome, which can modify the NAD+ metabolome through enzyme activities that are not present in mammals. Here, we show that orally delivered NMN can undergo direct deamidation and incorporation in mammalian tissue via the de novo pathway, and that this deamidation is reduced in animals treated with antibiotics to ablate the gut microbiome. Further, we show that antibiotics treatment increases the overall availability of NAD+ metabolites in the gut epithelium, with one possibility that the gut microbiome could be in competition with the host for dietary NAD+ precursors. Together, these data highlight previously undescribed interactions between orally delivered NMN and the gut microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Plants rely on the innate immune system to sense and respond to a wide range of lifestyle pathogens and to facilitate their survival in natural ecosystems. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP)-triggered immunity (PTI) and effector-triggered immunity (ETI) are designated as a two-branched system of innate immunity. Although PTI/ETI share a series of downstream molecular events, systematic analysis of convergent and divergent signaling in PTI/ETI is currently lacking. The phytohormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) are considered to constitute the hormonal backbone of plant immunity, are functionally antagonistic, and play essential roles in defending against biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, respectively. However, the distinct performance of two phytohormones in PTI/ETI remains unclear. Here, we systemically investigate and validate the reprogramming of molecular networks during PTI and ETI. Using publicly available Arabidopsis RNA sequence data from 560 samples, we construct a co-expression network under Mock conditions and then explore the differential expression/co-expression changes during PTI, ETI, and Pto DC3000 infection. During PTI and ETI, one-third of genes in the Arabidopsis genome exhibit the same directional differential expression in a manner independent of JA/ethylene/PAD4/SA signaling but show differential co-expression patterns. However, the defense phytohormone network is required for defense against Pto DC3000 infection. We also exhibit the use of this network in prioritizing genes that functioned closely with the proteins directly targeted by elicitors. Overall, this study will deepen our understanding of plant transcriptome in plant immunity and provide new insights into the mode of action of elicitors.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is implicated as the cause of pathology in various diseases such as Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. Polymorphism in the structure of fibrils formed by aggregation suggests the existence of many different assembly pathways and therefore a heterogeneous ensemble of soluble oligomers. Characterization of this heterogeneity is the key to understanding the aggregation mechanism and toxicity of specific oligomers, but in practice it is extremely difficult because oligomers cannot be readily separated. Here, we investigate highly heterogeneous oligomerization and fibril formation of the 42-residue amyloid-{beta} peptide (A{beta}42). We developed and used new single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopic and fluorescence lifetime imaging methods, combined with deep learning for image analysis. We found that the concentration of oligomers, including dimers, is extremely low and that the dimer is conformationally diverse. Aggregation to form fibrils is also highly heterogeneous in terms of the number of strands in a fibril and the elongation speed and conformation of fibrils. This heterogeneity in all stages of aggregation explains diverse and sometimes irreproducible results of experimental studies of amyloid-{beta}. Based on our observations and analysis, we propose a new model for aggregation of A{beta}42.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PaCa) is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. There is an unmet need to develop strategies to detect PaCa at an early, operable stage and prevent its progression. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) are cystic PaCa precursors that comprise nearly 50% of pancreatic cysts detected incidentally via cross-sectional imaging. Since IPMNs can progress from low- and moderate-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia and invasion, the study of these lesions offers a prime opportunity to develop early detection and prevention strategies. Organoids are an ideal preclinical platform to study IPMNs, and the objective of the current investigation was to establish a living biobank of patient-derived organoids (PDO) from IPMNs. IPMN tumors and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were successfully harvested from 15 patients with IPMNs undergoing pancreatic surgical resection at Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (Tampa, FL) between May of 2017 and March of 2019. Organoid cultures were also generated from cryopreserved tissues. Organoid count and size were determined over time by both Image-Pro Premier 3D Version 9.1 digital platform and Matlab application of a Circular Hough Transform algorithm, and histologic and genomic characterization of a subset of the organoids was performed using immunohistochemistry and targeted sequencing, respectively. The success rates for organoid generation from IPMN tumor and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues were 81% and 87%, respectively. IPMN organoids derived from different epithelial subtypes showed different morphologies in vitro, and organoids recapitulated histologic and genomic characteristics of the parental IPMN tumor. In summary, this pre-clinical model has the potential to provide new opportunities to unveil mechanisms of IPMN progression to invasion and to shed insight into novel biomarkers for early detection and targets for chemoprevention.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a suitable tool for recording brain function in pediatric or challenging populations. As with other neuroimaging techniques, the scientific community is engaged in an evolving debate regarding the most adequate methods for performing fNIRS data analyses.\n\nNew methodWe introduce LIONirs, a neuroinformatics toolbox for fNIRS data analysis, designed to follow two main goals: (1) flexibility, to explore several methods in parallel and verify results using 3D visualization; (2) simplicity, to apply a defined processing pipeline to a large dataset of subjects by using the MATLAB Batch System.\n\nResultsWithin the graphical user interfaces (DisplayGUI), the user can reject noisy intervals and correct artifacts, while visualizing the topographical projection of the data onto the 3D head representation. Data decomposition methods are available for the identification of relevant signatures, such as brain responses or artifacts. Multimodal data recorded simultaneously to fNIRS, such as physiology, electroencephalography or audio-video, can be visualized using the DisplayGUI. The toolbox includes several functions that allow one to read, preprocess, and analyze fNIRS data, including task-based and functional connectivity measures.\n\nComparison with existing methodsSeveral good neuroinformatics tools for fNIRS data analysis are currently available. None of them emphasize multimodal visualization of the data throughout the preprocessing steps and multidimensional decomposition, which are essential for understanding challenging data. Furthermore, LIONirs provides compatibility and complementarity with other existing tools by supporting common data format.\n\nConclusionsLIONirs offers a flexible platform for basic and advanced fNIRS data analysis, shown through real experimental examples.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe LIONirs toolbox is designed for fNIRS data inspection and visualization.\nC_LIO_LIMethods are integrated for isolation of relevant activity and correction of artifacts.\nC_LIO_LIMultimodal auxiliary, EEG or audio-video are visualized alongside the fNIRS data.\nC_LIO_LITask-based and functional connectivity measure analysis tools are available.\nC_LIO_LIThe code structure allows to automated and standardized analysis of large data set.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=76 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/257634v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9cced8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cfdcc3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a694fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7f35f4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Temporal changes in trait values (temporal trait plasticity) is one of the mechanisms for adaptive plastic response to environmental change. However, the consequence of temporal change in trait values and neighborhoods on the growth performance of individuals has rarely been investigated. We, therefore tested the effect of temporal changes in trait values and neighborhood crowding on the growth rate of individuals in a tropical forest using a dataset containing individual level growth and functional trait data for Ficus individuals. We collected trait and size data at two time points (2010 and 2017) for 472 individuals of 15 Ficus species in Xishuangbanna tropical forest dynamics plot, southwest China. We used linear mixed effect model to predict the effect of temporal trait plasticity and neighborhood crowding on the relative growth rate of individuals using these data. We found significant temporal changes in individuals functional traits suggesting a shift in ecological strategies from being functionally acquisitive to conservative. We also found differences in neighborhood crowding between the two census years indicating that the strength of individual interactions might change over time. The temporal changes in trait values and neighborhood crowding were found to predict better the relative growth rate of individuals, compared to static trait or crowding values in the initial and final censuses. We also found major axes of tree functional strategies in a principal component analysis, highlighting potentially adaptive trait differences. Our results in general highlight to consider the temporal dimension of functional traits and biotic interactions, as our result suggest that growth-trait relationships may vary between time points, allowing us to understand the demographic response of species to temporal environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) and its aggressive cutaneous exacerbation known as Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL) cause a huge disease burden in tropics and sub-tropic endemic zones worldwide. Contemporary treatment modalities have been associated with various complications. Encouraged from the recent marked antimalarial effects from plant derived glycosides; here we have chemically synthesized a library of diverse Glycoside derivatives (Gly 1-12) and evaluated their inhibitory efficacy against Ag83 strain of Leishmania donovani. In vitro activity of Glycoside-2 (Gly 2) on promastigote form of Ag83 strain, unravelled its prominent anti-leishmanial property with IC50 value of 1.13M. In-silico studies also unveiled the efficacy of Gly 2 to bind to the membrane surface of parasite. The toxic effect of Gly 2 causes necrosis like death in promastigote by abrogating its proliferation leading to imbalanced redox homeostasis by disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, Gly 2 treatment demonstrated increased susceptibility of parasites towards complement mediated lysis and displayed strong lethal effect on amastigote-macrophage infection model mimicking pathophysiological condition of body. This lead molecule was quite effective against the clinical on promastigotes form of PKDL strain BS12 with IC50 value of 1.97 M making it the most suitable drug so far which can target both VL and PKDL simultaneously. Based on the above experimental validations we narrowed our thoughts regarding the potent role of Gly 2 targeting surface protein of L. donovani such as Gp63, a zinc metalloprotease. Further analysis of structure activity relationship (SAR) of these glycoside derivatives, demonstrated exceptional binding affinity of Gly 2 towards Gp63, a zinc metalloprotease of L. donovani; with strong H-bond interactions of Gly 2 with catalytic domain in the -helix B region of Gp63. The strong confined interactions between Gly 2 and the target protein Gp63 in a physiologically relevant cellular environment was further assessed by Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) which corroborated with our previous results. Taken together, this study reports the serendipitous discovery of glycoside derivative Gly 2 with enhanced leishmanicidal activity and proves to be novel chemotherapeutic prototype against VL and PKDL.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA novel glycoside derivative (Gly 2) targets Gp63 functioning in L. donovani promastigotes, resulting in its abrogated proliferation and severely detabilized redox homeostasis, leading to parasitic death.\nC_LIO_LIStructure activity relationship (SAR) analysis revealed exceptional ligandability of Gly 2 towards Gp63 catalytic domain both in silico and in Cellular Thermal Shift Assay (CETSA) based in vitro analysis.\nC_LIO_LIGly 2 treatment exhibited increased parasite susceptibility towards complement mediated lysis and reduced macrophage infection in vitro mimicking the pathophysiological conditions.\nC_LIO_LIGly 2 showed profound antileishmanial activity against the clinical isolates of Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishmaniasis (PKDL).\nC_LI",

We here tested if repeated recall induces a similar semanticization, and if the resulting qualitative changes in memories can be measured using simple feature-specific reaction time probes. Participants studied associations between verbs and object images, and then repeatedly recalled the objects when cued with the verb, immediately and after a two-day delay. Reaction times during immediate recall demonstrated that conceptual features were accessed faster than perceptual features. Consistent with a semanticization process, this perceptual-conceptual gap significantly increased across the delay. A significantly smaller perceptual-conceptual gap was found in the delayed recall data of a control group who repeatedly studied the verb-object pairings on the first day, instead of actively recalling them. Our findings suggest that wake recall and offline consolidation interact to transform memories over time, strengthening meaningful semantic information over perceptual detail.",

VmPFC BOLD encoded cue valence, importantly predicting trial-by-trial valence-driven response speed differences and EEG theta power around cue onset. In contrast, striatal BOLD encoded selection of active Go responses and correlated with theta power around response time. Within trials, theta power ramped in the fashion of an evidence accumulation signal for the value of making a  Go response, capturing the faster responding to reward cues.

However, across a broad population of PFC neurons, we found no evidence of current-goal-specific memory in any previously reported form - i.e. differences in the rate, sequence, phase or covariance of firing. This suggests such patterns do not hold working memory in the PFC when information must be employed flexibly. Instead, the PFC grouped locations representing behaviorally equivalent task features together, consistent with a role in encoding long-term knowledge of task structure.",

    "abstract": "Food processing environments can harbor microorganisms responsible for food spoilage or foodborne disease. Efficient and accurate identification of microorganisms throughout the food chain can allow the identification of sources of contamination and the timely implementation of control measures. Currently, microbial monitoring of the food chain relies heavily on culture-based techniques. These assays are determined on the microbes expected to be present in the environment, and thus do not cater for unexpected contaminants. Many culture-based assays are also unable to distinguish between undesirable taxa and closely related harmless species. Furthermore, even when multiple culture-based approaches are used in parallel, it is still not possible to comprehensively characterize the entire microbiology of a food-chain sample.\n\nHigh throughput DNA sequencing represents a potential means through which microbial monitoring of the food chain can be enhanced. While sequencing platforms, such as the Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq and NovaSeq, are most typically found in research or commercial sequencing laboratories, newer portable platforms, such as the Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION, offer the potential for rapid analysis of food chain microbiomes. In this study, having initially assessed the ability of rapid MinION-based sequencing to discriminate between different microbes within a simple mock metagenomic mixture of related food spoilage, spore-forming microorganisms. Subsequently, we proceeded to compare the performance of both ONT and Illumina sequencing for environmental monitoring of an active food processing facility.\n\nOverall, ONT MinION sequencing provided accurate classification to species level, which was comparable to Illumina-derived outputs. However, while the MinION-based approach provided a means of easy library preparations and portability, the high concentrations of DNA needed to run the rapid sequencing protocols was a limiting factor, requiring the random amplification of template DNA in order to generate sufficient material for analysis.",

The dispersion cycle is critical for controlling the population of important target microbes (both pathogenic and beneficial). Here, we show that the hysteresis of Bacillus subtilis cell-type regulation with respect to auto-inducing signal strength triggers the migration cycle of the cell population. We investigate migration cycle and its dependence on environmental conditions by quantitative analysis of cyclically expanding, concentric circular colonies. Next, we construct an input/output model that controls cell types in response to environmental conditions and signal density. On the basis of this model, we propose a migration cycle model for cell populations.

Understanding the genetic basis of sex dimorphism and its evolution is crucial for understanding biological differences between the sexes. Genetic variants with sex-antagonistic effects on fitness are expected to segregate in populations at the early phases of sexual dimorphism emergence. Detecting such variants is notoriously difficult, and the few genome-scan methods employed so far have limited power and little specificity. Here, we propose a new framework to detect a signature of sexually antagonistic selection. We rely on trio datasets where sex-biased transmission distortions can be directly tracked from parents to offspring, and allows identifying signal of sexually antagonistic transmission distortions in genomic regions. We report the genomic location and recombination pattern surrounding 66 regions detected as potentially under sexually antagonist selection. We find an enrichment of genes associated with embryonic development within these regions. Last, we highlight two candidates regions for sexually antagonistic selection in humans.",

    "abstract": "The field of phylogeography has evolved rapidly in terms of the analytical toolkit to analyze the ever-increasing amounts of genomic data. Despite substantial advances, researchers have not fully explored all potential analytical tools to tackle the challenge posed by the huge size of genomic datasets. For example, deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), widely employed in image and video classification, are largely unexplored for phylogeographic model selection. In non-model organisms, the lack of information about their ecology, natural history, and evolution can lead to uncertainty about which set of demographic models should be considered. Here we investigate the utility of CNNs for assessing a large number of competing phylogeographic models using South American lizards as an example, and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to contrast the performance of CNNs. First, we evaluated three demographic scenarios (constant, expansion, and bottleneck) for each of four recovered lineages and found that the overall model accuracy was higher than 98% for all lineages. Next, we evaluated a set of 26 models that accounted for evolutionary relationships, gene flow, and changes in effective population size among these lineages and recovered an overall accuracy of 87%. In contrast, ABC was unable to single out a best fit model among 26 competing models. Finally, we used the CNN model to investigate the evolutionary history of two South American lizards. Our results indicate the presence of hidden genetic diversity, gene flow between non-sister populations, and changes in effective population sizes through time, likely in response to Pleistocene climatic oscillations. Our results demonstrate that CNNs can be easily and usefully incorporated into the phylogeographers toolkit.",

    "abstract": "Intercrop breeding programs using genomic selection can produce faster genetic gain than intercrop breeding programs using phenotypic selection. Intercropping is an agricultural practice in which two or more component crops are grown together. It can lead to enhanced soil structure and fertility, improved weed suppression, and better control of pests and diseases. Especially in subsistence agriculture, intercropping has great potential to optimise farming and increase profitability. However, breeding for intercrop varieties is complex as it requires simultaneous improvement of two or more component crops that combine well in the field. We hypothesize that genomic selection can significantly simplify and accelerate the process of breeding crops for intercropping. Therefore, we used stochastic simulation to compare four different intercrop breeding programs implementing genomic selection and an intercrop breeding program entirely based on phenotypic selection. We assumed three different levels of genetic correlation between monocrop grain yield and intercrop grain yield to investigate how the different breeding strategies are impacted by this factor. We found that all four simulated breeding programs using genomic selection produced significantly more intercrop genetic gain than the phenotypic selection program regardless of the genetic correlation with monocrop yield. We suggest a genomic selection strategy which combines monocrop and intercrop trait information to predict general intercropping ability to increase selection accuracy in early stages of a breeding program and to minimize the generation interval.",

We found that that with hypothetical distributions similar to cell-to-cell movement data, the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon produces a false positive rate of 17% while the bootstrap method maintains a false positive at the set rate of 5% under the same circumstances.

Veins consist of at least seven distinct cell types, with specific roles in transport, metabolism, and signaling. Little is known about the vascular cells in leaves, in particular the phloem parenchyma (PP). PP effluxes sucrose into the apoplasm as a basis for phloem loading; yet PP has only been characterized microscopically. Here, we enriched vascular cells from Arabidopsis leaves to generate a single-cell transcriptome atlas of leaf vasculature. We identified [&ge;]19 cell clusters, encompassing epidermis, guard cells, hydathodes, mesophyll, and all vascular cell types, and used metabolic pathway analysis to define their roles. Clusters comprising PP cells were enriched for transporters, including SWEET11 and SWEET12 sucrose and UmamiT amino acid efflux carriers. PP development occurs independently from APL, a transcription factor required for phloem differentiation. PP cells have a unique pattern of amino acid metabolism activity distinct from companion cells (CC), explaining differential distribution/metabolism of amino acids in veins. The kinship relation of the vascular clusters is strikingly similar to the vein morphology, except for a clear separation of CC from the other vascular cells including PP. In summary, our scRNA-seq analysis provides a wide range of information into the leaf vasculature and the role and relationship of the leaf cell types.",

Immediately upon nitrogen-limitation, newly fixed carbon is re-directed towards glycogen synthesis. How the metabolic switch for distributing fixed carbon to either glycogen or cellular building blocks is operated was poorly understood. Here we identify from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 a novel PII interactor, PirC, (Sll0944) that controls 3-phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), the enzyme that deviates newly fixed CO2 towards lower glycolysis. PirC acts as competitive inhibitor of PGAM and this interaction is tuned by PII/2-oxoglutarate. High oxoglutarate release PirC from PII-complex to inhibit PGAM. Accordingly, PirC deficient mutant, as compared to the wild-type, shows strongly reduced glycogen levels upon nitrogen deprivation whereas polyhydroxybutyrate granules are over-accumulated. Metabolome analysis revealed an imbalance in 3-phosphoglycerate to pyruvate levels in the PirC mutant, conforming that PirC controls the carbon flux in cyanobacteria via mutually exclusive interaction with either PII or PGAM.",

However, the effectiveness of this therapy could vary, and partly depend on the donors bacterial species engraftment, whose evaluation is challenging because there are no cost-effective strategies for accurately tracking the microbe transference. In this regard, the precise identification of bacterial species inhabiting the human gut is essential to define their role in human health unambiguously. We used Nanopore-based device to sequence bacterial rrn operons (16S-ITS-23S) and to reveal species-level abundance changes in the human gut microbiota of a FMT trial. By assessing the donor and recipient microbiota before and after FMT, we further evaluated whether this molecular approach reveals strain-level genetic variation to demonstrate microbe transfer and engraftment. Strict control over sequencing data quality and major microbiota covariates was critical for accurately estimating the changes in gut microbial species abundance in the recipients after FMT. We detected strain-level variation via single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) at rrn regions in a species-specific manner. We showed that it was possible to explore successfully the donor-bacterial strain (e.g., Parabacteroides merdae) engraftment in recipients of the FMT by assessing the nucleotide frequencies at rrn-associated SNVs. Our findings indicate that the engraftment of donors microbiota is to some extent correlated with the improvement of metabolic health in recipients and that parameters such as the baseline gut microbiota configuration, sex, and age of donors should be considered to ensure the success of FMT in humans.\n\nTrial registrationThe study was prospectively registered at the Dutch Trial registry - NTR4488 (https://www.trialregister.nl/trial/4488).",

    "abstract": "Accurate translation of genetic information into proteins is vital for cell sustainability. ProXp-ala prevents proteome-wide Pro-to-Ala mutations by hydrolyzing misacylated Ala-tRNAPro, which is synthesized by prolyl-tRNA synthetase (ProRS). Bacterial ProXp-ala was previously shown to combine a size-based exclusion mechanism with conformational and chemical selection for the recognition of the alanyl moiety, while tRNAPro is selected via recognition of tRNA acceptor stem elements G72 and A73. The identity of these critical bases changed during evolution with eukaryotic cytosolic tRNAPro possessing a cytosine at the corresponding positions. The mechanism by which eukaryotic ProXp-ala adapted to these changes remains unknown. In this work, recognition of the aminoacyl moiety and tRNA acceptor stem by human (Hs) ProXp-ala was examined. Enzymatic assays revealed that Hs ProXp-ala requires C72 and C73 in the context of Hs cytosolic tRNAPro for efficient deacylation of mischarged Ala-tRNAPro. The strong dependence on these bases prevents cross-species deacylation of bacterial Ala-tRNAPro or of Hs mitochondrial Ala-tRNAPro by the human enzyme. Similar to the bacterial enzyme, Hs ProXp-ala showed strong tRNA acceptor-stem recognition but differed in its amino acid specificity profile relative to bacterial ProXp-ala. Changes at conserved residues in both the Hs and bacterial ProXp-ala substrate binding pockets modulated this specificity. These results illustrate how the mechanism of substrate selection diverged during the evolution of the ProXp-ala family and provides the first example of a trans-editing domain whose specificity evolved to adapt to changes in its tRNA substrate.",

    "abstract": "Despite considerable research progress on SARS-CoV-2, the direct zoonotic origin (intermediate host) of the virus remains ambiguous. The most definitive approach to identify the intermediate host would be the detection of SARS-CoV-2-like coronaviruses in wild animals. However, due to the high number of animal species, it is not feasible to screen all the species in the laboratory. Given that the recognition of the binding ACE2 proteins is the first step for the coronaviruses to invade host cells, we proposed a computational pipeline to identify potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 by modeling the binding affinity between the Spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) and host ACE2. Using this pipeline, we systematically examined 285 ACE2 variants from mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, and found that the binding energies calculated on the modeled Spike-RBD/ACE2 complex structures correlate closely with the effectiveness of animal infections as determined by multiple experimental datasets. Built on the optimized binding affinity cutoff, we suggested a set of 96 mammals, including 48 experimentally investigated ones, which are permissive to SARS-CoV-2, with candidates from primates, rodents, and carnivores at the highest risk of infection. Overall, this work not only suggested a limited range of potential intermediate SARS-CoV-2 hosts for further experimental investigation; but more importantly, it proposed a new structure-based approach to general zoonotic origin and susceptibility analyses that are critical for human infectious disease control and wildlife protection.",

Its variant carrying mutated Spike (S) protein D614G (SD614G) has become the most prevalent form in the current global pandemic4,5. We have identified a large panel of potential neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) targeting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 S6. Here, we focused on the top 20 potential NAbs for the mechanism study. Of them, the top 4 NAbs could individually neutralize both authentic SARS-CoV-2 and SD614G pseudovirus efficiently. Our epitope mapping revealed that 16/20 potent NAbs overlapped the same steric epitope. Excitingly, we found that one of these potent NAbs (58G6) exclusively bound to a linear epitope on S-RBD (termed as 58G6e), and the interaction of 58G6e and the recombinant ACE2 could be blocked by 58G6. We confirmed that 58G6e represented a key site of vulnerability on S-RBD and it could positively react with COVID-19 convalescent patients plasma. We are the first, as far as we know, to provide direct evidences of a linear epitope that can be recognized by a potent NAb against SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD.

    "abstract": "IntroductionWe present the sequence analysis for 47 complete genomes for SARS-CoV-2 isolates on Turkish patients. To identify their genetic similarity, phylogenetic analysis was performed by comparing the worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequences, selected from GISAID, to the complete genomes from Turkish isolates. In addition, we focused on the variation analysis to show the mutations on SARS-CoV-2 genomes.\n\nMethodsIllumina MiSeq platform was used for sequencing the libraries. The raw reads were aligned to the known SARS-CoV-2 genome (GenBank: MN908947.3) using the Burrows-Wheeler aligner (v.0.7.1). The phylogenetic tree was constructer using Phylip v.3.6 with Neighbor-Joining and composite likelihood method. The variants were detected by using Genome Analysis Toolkit-HaplotypeCaller v.3.8.0 and were inspected on GenomeBrowse v2.1.2.\n\nResultsAll viral genome sequences of our isolates was located in lineage B under the different clusters such as B.1 (n=3), B.1.1 (n=28), and B.1.9 (n=16). According to the GISAID nomenclature, all our complete genomes were placed in G, GR and GH clades. Five hundred forty-nine total and 53 unique variants were detected. All 47 genomes exhibited different kinds of variants. The distinct variants consist of 274 missense, 225 synonymous, and 50 non-coding alleles.\n\nConclusionThe results indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 sequences of our isolates have great similarity with all Turkish and European sequences. Further studies should be performed for better comparison of strains, after more complete genome sequences will be released. We also believe that collecting and sharing any data about SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19 will be effective and may help the related studies.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has devastated the global economy and claimed nearly one million lives, presenting an urgent global health crisis. To identify host factors required for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses, we designed a focused high-coverage CRISPR-Cas9 library targeting 332 members of a recently published SARS-CoV-2 protein interactome. We leveraged the compact nature of this library to systematically screen four related coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2) at two physiologically relevant temperatures (33 {degrees}C and 37 {degrees}C), allowing us to probe this interactome at a much higher resolution relative to genome scale studies. This approach yielded several new insights, including unexpected virus and temperature specific differences in Rab GTPase requirements and GPI anchor biosynthesis, as well as identification of multiple pan-coronavirus factors involved in cholesterol homeostasis. This coronavirus essentiality catalog could inform ongoing drug development efforts aimed at intercepting and treating COVID-19, and help prepare for future coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSFocused CRISPR screens targeting host factors in the SARS-CoV-2 interactome were performed for SARS-CoV-2, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-OC43 coronaviruses.\n\nFocused interactome CRISPR screens achieve higher resolution compared to genome-wide screens, leading to the identification of critical factors missed by the latter.\n\nParallel CRISPR screens against multiple coronaviruses uncover host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles.\n\nThe number of host proteins that interact with a viral bait protein is not proportional to the number of functional interactors.\n\nNovel SARS-CoV-2 host factors are expressed in relevant cell types in the human airway.",

    "abstract": "Comparative functional analysis of the dynamic interactions between various Betacoronavirus mutant strains and broadly utilized target proteins such as ACE2 and CD26, is crucial for a more complete understanding of zoonotic spillovers of viruses that cause diseases such as COVID-19. Here, we employ machine learning to replicated sets of nanosecond scale GPU accelerated molecular dynamics simulations to statistically compare and classify atom motions of these target proteins in both the presence and absence of different endemic and emergent strains of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S spike glycoprotein. Machine learning was used to identify functional binding dynamics that are evolutionarily conserved from bat CoV-HKU4 to human endemic/emergent strains. Conserved dynamics regions of ACE2 involve both the N-terminal helices, as well as a region of more transient dynamics encompassing K353, Q325 and a novel motif AAQPFLL 386-92 that appears to coordinate their dynamic interactions with the viral RBD at N501. We also demonstrate that the functional evolution of Betacoronavirus zoonotic spillovers involving ACE2 interaction dynamics are likely pre-adapted from two precise and stable binding sites involving the viral bat progenitor strains interaction with CD26 at SAMLI 291-5 and SS 333-334. Our analyses further indicate that the human endemic strains hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-OC43 have evolved more stable N-terminal helix interactions through enhancement of an interfacing loop region on the viral RBD, whereas the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants (B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1) have evolved more stable viral binding via more focused interactions between the viral N501 and ACE2 K353 alone.",

    "abstract": "Nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1) of SARS-CoV-2 plays a key role in downregulation of RIG-I pathways and interacts with 40 S ribosome. Recently, the cryo-EM structure in complex with 40S ribosome is deciphered. However, the structure of full length NSP1 without any partner has not been studies. Also, the conformation of NSP1-C terminal region in isolation is not been studied. In this study, we have investigated the conformational dynamics of NSP1C-terminal region (NSP1-CTR; amino acids 130-180) in isolation and under different solvent environments. The NSP1-CTR is found to be intrinsically disordered in aqueous solution. Further, we used alpha helix inducer, trifluoroethanol, and found induction of alpha helical conformation using CD spectroscopy. Additionally, in the presence of SDS, NSP1-CTR is showing a conformational change from disordered to ordered, possibly gaining alpha helix in part. But in presence of neutral lipid DOPC, a slight change in conformation is observed. This implies the possible role of hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction on the conformational changes of NSP1. The changes in structural conformation were further studied by fluorescence-based studies, which showed significant blue shift and fluorescence quenching in the presence of SDS and TFE. Lipid vesicles also showed fluorescence-based quenching. In agreement to these result, fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy decay suggests a change in conformational dynamics. The zeta potential studies further validated that the conformational dynamics is mostly because of hydrophobic interaction. In last, these experimental studies were complemented through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation which have also shown a good correlation and testify our experiments. We believe that the intrinsically disordered nature of the NSP1-CTR will have implications in disorder based binding promiscuity with its interacting proteins.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile spores produced during infection are essential for the recurrence of the disease. However, how C. difficile spores persist in the intestinal mucosa to cause recurrent infection remains unknown. Here, we show that C. difficile spores gain entry into the intestinal mucosa via fibronectin-5{beta}1 and vitronectin-v{beta}1 specific-pathways. The spore-surface exosporium BclA3 protein is essential for both spore-entry pathways into intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, C. difficile spores of a bclA3 isogenic mutant exhibited reduced entry into the intestinal mucosa and reduced recurrence of the disease in a mouse model of the disease. Inhibition of C. difficile spore-entry led to reduced spore-entry into the intestinal epithelial barrier and recurrence of C. difficile infection in vivo. These findings suggest that C. difficile spore-entry into the intestinal barrier is a novel mechanism of spore-persistence that can contribute to infection recurrence and have implications for the rational design of therapies.",

    "abstract": "The forkhead box (Fox) genes encode transcription factors that control several key aspects of development. Present in the ancestor of all eukaryotes, Fox genes underwent several duplications followed by loss and diversification events that gave rise to the current 25 families. However, few Fox members have been identified from the Lophotrochozoa clade, and specifically from planarians, which are a unique model for understanding development, due to the striking plasticity of the adult. The aim of this study was to identify and perform evolutionary and functional studies of the Fox genes of lophotrochozoan species and, specifically, of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. Generating a pipeline for identifying Forkhead domains and using phylogenetics allowed us the phylogenetic reconstruction of Fox genes. We corrected the annotation for misannotated genes and uncover a new family, the QD, present in all metazoans. According to the new phylogeny, the 27 Fox genes found in Schmidtea mediterranea were classified into 12 families. In Platyhelminthes, family losses were accompanied by extensive gene diversification and the appearance of specific families, the A(P) and N(P). Among the newly identified planarian Fox genes, we found a single copy of foxO, which shows an evolutionary conserved role in controlling cell death.\n\nAuthor summaryTranscription factors are the key elements that regulate gene expression in the nucleus. The forkhead box (Fox) transcription factors are one of the most numerous and they control key aspects of development. Fox genes were already present in the ancestor of all eukaryotes, and then underwent several duplications followed by loss and diversification events that gave rise to the current Fox families in the different species. The available data classifies Fox genes in 25 families, but they include few members corresponding to Lophotrocozoa, one of the two invertebrate phyla that includes annelids, molluscs or platyhelmintes. In this study we identify and perform evolutionary studies of the Fox genes of several lophotrochozoan species and, specifically, of the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. The result is the correction of the annotation of Fox genes from many species, proposing a new nomenclature, and the identification of new families; the QD family, present in all metazoans, and the A(P) and N(P) families, specific of Platyhelminthes. We also study the function of Schmidtea mediterranea foxO, a gene involved in aging and cancer in other species, showing its evolutionary conserved role in controlling cell death according to cell metabolism.",

We measured NDPK expression and activity in EVs isolated from triple-negative breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) and non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial (HME1) cells using flow cytometry, western blot, and ATP assay. We evaluated the effects of EV-associated NDPK on endothelial cell migration, vascular remodeling, and metastasis. We further assessed MDA-MB-231 EV induced-proteomic changes in support of pre-metastatic lung niche formation. NDPK-B expression and phosphotransferase activity were enriched in MDA-MB-231 EVs that promote vascular endothelial cell migration and disrupt monolayer integrity. MDA-MB-231 EV-treated mice demonstrate pulmonary vascular leakage and enhanced experimental lung metastasis, whereas treatment with an NDPK inhibitor or a P2Y1 purinoreceptor antagonist blunts these effects. We identified perturbations to the purinergic signaling pathway in experimental lungs, lending evidence to support a role for EV-associated NDPK-B in lung pre-metastatic niche formation and metastatic outgrowth.",

This potent blockade has long been attributed to myelin-associated inhibitors and CSPGs, but incomplete lesions and conflicting reports have prevented conclusive agreement. Here we evaluated DR regeneration in mice, using novel strategies to facilitate complete lesions and analyses, selective tracing of proprioceptive and mechanoreceptive axons, and the first simultaneous targeting of Nogo/Reticulon-4, MAG, OMgp, CSPGs and GDNF. Co-eliminating myelin inhibitors and CSPGs elicited regeneration of only a few conditioning-lesioned DR axons across the DREZ. Their absence, however, markedly and synergistically enhanced regeneration of GDNF-stimulated axons, highlighting the importance of sufficiently elevating intrinsic growth capacity. We also conclude that myelin inhibitors and CSPGs are not the primary mechanism stopping axons at the DREZ.",

    "abstract": "The costimulatory receptor, CD28, synergizes with the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) to promote IL-2 production, cell survival and proliferation. Despite their profound synergy, the obligatory interdependence of the signaling pathways initiated by these two receptors is not well understood. Upon TCR stimulation, Gads, a Grb2-family adaptor, bridges the interaction of two additional adaptors, LAT and SLP-76, to form a TCR-induced effector signaling complex. SLP-76 binds the Tec-family tyrosine kinase, Itk, which phosphorylates SLP-76 at Y173 and PLC-{gamma}1 at Y783. Here we identified Gads Y45 as an additional TCR-inducible, Itk-mediated phosphorylation site. Y45 is found within the N-terminal SH3 domain of Gads, an evolutionarily conserved domain with no known binding partners or signaling function. Gads Y45 phosphorylation depended on the interaction of Gads with SLP-76 and on the preferentially-paired binding of Gads to phospho-LAT. Three Itk-related features, Gads Y45, SLP-76 Y173, and a proline-rich Itk SH3-binding motif on SLP-76, were selectively required for activation of the CD28 RE/AP transcriptional element from the IL-2 promoter, but were not required to activate NFAT. This study illuminates a new regulatory module, in which Itk-targeted phosphorylation sites on two adaptor proteins, SLP-76 and Gads, control the transcriptional response to TCR/CD28 costimulation, thus enforcing the obligatory interdependence of the TCR and CD28 signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that persists in the central nervous system as intracellular chronic stage bradyzoites that are encapsulated by a thick cyst wall. While the cyst wall separates bradyzoites from the host cytosol, it has been posited that small solutes can traverse the cyst wall to sustain bradyzoites. Recently it was found that host cytosolic macromolecules can cross the parasitophorous vacuole and are ingested and digested by actively replicating acute stage tachyzoites. However, the extent to which bradyzoites have an active ingestion pathway remained unknown. To interrogate this, we modified previously published protocols that look at tachyzoite acquisition and digestion of host proteins by measuring parasite accumulation of a host-expressed reporter protein after impairment of an endolysosomal protease (Cathepsin Protease L, CPL). Using two cystogenic parasite strains (ME49 and Pru), we demonstrate that T. gondii bradyzoites can ingest host-derived cytosolic mCherry. Bradyzoites acquire host mCherry within 4 hours of invasion and post-cyst wall formation. This study provides direct evidence that host macromolecules can be internalized by T. gondii bradyzoites across the cyst wall in infected cells.",

    "abstract": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) establishes lifelong neuronal latency in most humans world-wide, reactivating in one-third to cause herpes zoster and occasionally chronic pain. How VZV establishes, maintains and reactivates from latency is largely unknown. Latent VZV gene expression is restricted to VZV latency-associated transcript (VLT) and open reading frame 63 (ORF63) in naturally VZV-infected human trigeminal ganglia (TG). Notably, these transcript levels positively correlated suggesting co-regulated transcription during latency. Here, we used direct RNA-sequencing to identify fusion transcripts that combine VLT and ORF63 loci (VLT-ORF63) and are expressed during both lytic and latent VZV infections. Furthermore, real-time PCR, RNA in situ hybridization and 5 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) all confirmed VLT-ORF63, but not canonical ORF63, expression in human TG. During lytic infection, one of the two major VLT-ORF63 isoforms encodes a novel fusion protein combining VLT and ORF63 proteins (pVLT-ORF63). In vitro, VLT is transcribed in latently VZV-infected human sensory neurons, whereas VLT-ORF63 expression is induced by reactivation stimuli. Moreover, the pVLT-ORF63-encoding VLT-ORF63 isoform induced transcription of lytic VZV genes. Collectively, our findings show that VZV expresses a unique set of VLT-ORF63 transcripts, potentially involved in the transition from latency to lytic VZV infection.",

    "abstract": "The precise mechanism of transcription termination of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase III (Pol III) has been a subject of considerable debate. Although previous studies have clearly shown that at the end of RNA transcripts, tracts comprised of multiple uracils are required for Pol III termination, whether upstream RNA secondary structure in the nascent transcript is necessary for robust transcriptional termination is still subject to debate. We sought to address this directly through the development of an in cellulo Pol III transcription termination assay using a synthetic biology approach. Specifically, we utilized the recently developed Tornado expression system and a stabilized Corn RNA aptamer to create a Pol III-transcribed RNA that produces a detectable fluorescent signal when transcribed in human cells. To study the effects of RNA sequence and structure on Pol III termination, we systematically varied the sequence context upstream of the aptamer and identified sequence characteristics that enhance or diminish termination. We found that in the absence of predicted secondary structure, only poly-U tracts longer than then the average length found in the human genome (4-5 nucleotides), efficiently terminate Pol III transcription. We found that shorter poly-U tracts could induce termination when placed in proximity to secondary structural elements, while secondary structure by itself was not sufficient to induce termination. These findings demonstrate a key role for sequence and structural elements within Pol III-transcribed nascent RNA for efficient transcription termination, and demonstrate a generalizable assay for characterizing Pol III transcription in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Microtubule, composed of {beta}-tubulin heterodimers, remains as one of the most popular anticancer targets for decades. To date, anti-microtubule drugs are mainly functionally divided into microtubule-destabilizing and microtubule-stabilizing agents while microtubule- or tubulin-degradation agents are rarely reported. Six known binding sites on tubulin dimer are identified with five sites on {beta}-tubulin and only one site on -tubulin (pironetin site), hinting compounds binding to -tubulin are less well characterized. Cevipabulin, a microtubule-active antitumor clinical candidate, is widely accepted as a microtubule-stabilizing agent by binding to the vinblastine site. Our X-ray crystallography study reveals that, in addition binding to the vinblastine site, cevipabulin also binds to a novel site on -tubulin (named the seventh site) which located near the nonexchangeable GTP. Interestingly, we find the binding of cevipabulin to the seventh site induces tubulin degradation. As the non-exchangeable GTP has structural role and is important for the stability of tubulin dimers, we propose and confirm the tubulin degradation mechanism as: Cevipabulin at the seventh site puts the T5 loop outward to make the non-exchangeable GTP exchangeable, which reduces the stability of tubulin and results in its destabilization and degradation. Our results confirm a novel agent binding site on -tubulin and shed light on the development of tubulin degraders as a new generation of anti-microtubule drugs targeting this novel site.",

Among the stem cell lineages determined during early embryonic development, trophoblast stem (TS) cells exhibit robust SATB expression. Both SATB1 and SATB2 act to maintain trophoblast stem-state. However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate TS-specific Satb expression are not yet known. We identified Satb1 variant 2 as the predominant transcript in trophoblasts. Histone marks, and RNA polymerase II occupancy in TS cells indicated active state of the promoter. A novel cis-regulatory region with active histone marks was identified [~]21kbp upstream of variant 2 promoter. CRISPR/Cas9 mediated disruption of this sequence decreased Satb1 expression in TS cells and chromatin conformation capture confirmed looping of this regulatory region into the promoter. Scanning position weight matrices across the enhancer predicted two ELF5 binding sites in close vicinity of SATB1 sites, which were confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation. Knockdown of ELF5 downregulated Satb1 expression in TS cells and overexpression of ELF5 increased the enhancer-reporter activity. Interestingly, ELF5 interacts with SATB1 in TS cells, and the enhancer activity was upregulated following SATB overexpression. Our findings indicate that trophoblast-specific Satb1 expression is regulated by long-range chromatin looping of an enhancer that interacts with ELF5 and SATB proteins.",

We utilized a free-living flatworm Schmidtea mediterranea to develop an integrative approach consisting of decellularization, proteomics, and RNA-interference (RNAi) to characterize and investigate ECM functions during tissue homeostasis and regeneration. High-quality ECM was isolated from planarians, and its matrisome profile was characterized by LC-MS/MS. The functions of identified ECM components were interrogated using RNAi. Using this approach, we discovered that heparan sulfate proteoglycan and kyphoscoliosis peptidase are essential for both tissue homeostasis and regeneration. Our strategy provides a robust experimental approach for identifying novel ECM components involved in regeneration that might not be discovered bioinformatically.",

We show that the D haplotype is structurally and genetically distinct and swept to a high stable frequency within the past 1500 years. Quantitative genetic analyses reveal that variation in the strength of drive primarily depends on the identity of the non-D centromere, but also identified an unlinked modifier coincident with kinetochore protein Centromere-specific Histone 3 A (CenH3A). CenH3A has also experienced a recent (<1000 years) selective sweep in our focal population, consistent with ongoing interactions with D shaping its evolution. Together, our results demonstrate an active co-evolutionary arms race between the DNA and protein components of the meiotic machinery, with important consequences for individual fitness and molecular divergence.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor SOX9 is expressed in multiple tissues during embryogenesis and directs developmental processes. SOX9 is activated upon endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in the developing heart, but its role in regulating this process is less clear. Using human umbilical vein endothelial cells as an EndMT model, we show that SOX9 expression alone is sufficient to activate mesenchymal enhancers and steer endothelial cells towards a mesenchymal fate. By genome-wide mapping of the chromatin landscape, we show that SOX9 acts as a pioneer transcription factor, having the ability to open chromatin and lead to deposition of active histone marks at a specific subset of previously silent enhancers, guided by SOX motifs and H2A.Z enrichment. This leads to a switch in enhancer activity states resulting in activation of mesenchymal genes and concurrent suppression of endothelial genes to drive EndMT. Moreover, we show that SOX9 chromatin binding is dynamic, but induces stable changes in the chromatin landscape. Our data also show widespread SOX9 chromatin scanning in silent chromatin that is not associated with SOX motifs or H2A.Z enrichment. Our study highlights the crucial developmental role of SOX9 and provides new insight into key molecular functions of SOX9 in the chromatin landscape and mechanisms of EndMT.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/293993v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1248576org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b6420forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aaffc5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17de585_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, the precise molecular mechanisms of action for IFITM-mediated viral restriction are still unclear. To investigate how site-specific S-palmitoylation controls IFITM3 antiviral activity, here we employed computational, chemical, and biophysical approaches to demonstrate that site-specific lipidation of IFITM3 at highly conserved cysteine 72 modulates its conformation and interaction with lipid membranes leading to enhanced antiviral activity of IFITM3 in mammalian cells.

Yet, the increasing number of genomes available complicates the establishment of the basic building blocks of comparative genomics.

While many programs building pangenomes have become available in the last few years, we have focused on a modular method, that tackles all the key steps of the process, from download to phylogenetic inference. While all steps are integrated, they can also be run separately and multiple times to allow rapid and extensive exploration of the parameters of interest. The software is built in Python3 and includes features to facilitate its future development. We believe PanACoTa is an interesting addition to the current set of comparative genomics tools, since it will accelerate and standardize the more routine parts of the work, allowing microbial genomicists to more quickly tackle their specific questions.",

    "abstract": "Forkhead Box A1 (FOXA1) is a pioneer transcription factor critical in epigenetic regulation of chromatin and cell fate determination. Reduced FOXA1 expression is an independent predictor of poor overall survival in bladder cancer patients. However, the impact of FOXA1 loss on chromatin epigenetics in bladder cancer is unknown. Therefore, we determined the impact of FOXA1 knock out (KO) on epigenetic modification of chromatin and associated gene expression. We identified 8,230 differentially expressed genes following FOXA1 KO. Surprisingly, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) identified IFN[a]/{gamma} gene expression signatures as enriched following FOXA1 KO. FOXA1 KO induced both increased and decreased numbers of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) sites throughout the genome. As expected, the majority of differences in H3K27ac across genomic areas in FOXA1 KO cells is mapped to intergenic and intronic regions where enhancers reside. In addition, a subset of differential H3K27ac levels were also mapped to proximal promoters and within gene bodies. Integrated analysis of RNA/ChIP-seq data shows changes in gene expression that are mirrored by differences in H3K27ac. Motif analysis of DNA sequence enriched for H3K27ac identified significant increases in transcription factor binding motifs including the interferon sensitive response element (ISRE) and interferon response factors such as IRF1. Moreover, we identified increased H3K27ac of regulatory elements as being associated with several upregulated interferon sensitive genes (ISGs) in FOXA1 KO cells, including CD274/PD-L1. Western blotting and Q-RT-PCR confirmed upregulation of CD274/PD-L1 following FOXA1 KO. Analysis of TCGA data confirmed an inverse relationship between FOXA1 and CD274 in bladder cancer, as well as in other cancers. In summary, we provide evidence of widespread epigenetic reprogramming after FOXA1 KO in bladder cancer cells. Additionally, we provide evidence that FOXA1 KO-induced epigenetic changes contribute to activation of a global interferon-dominant expression signature, including the immune checkpoint target CD274/PD-L1 in a cancer cell-intrinsic manner.",

    "abstract": "Orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are largely intractable therapeutic targets, owing to the lack of chemical tools for exploring their pharmacology. The discovery of such tools, however, is hampered by a number of unknowns, such as effector coupling and appropriate positive controls. In our 2017 Nature Chemical Biology paper1, we developed a computational chemical tool discovery approach called GPCR Contact-Informed Neighboring Pocket (GPCR-CoINPocket). This method predicted pharmacological similarity of GPCRs in a ligand- and structure-independent manner, to enable the discovery of off-target activities of known compounds at orphan GPCRs and hence the identification of so-called surrogate ligands. Our orphan GPCR target for prospective surrogate ligand discovery efforts was GPR37L1, a brain-specific receptor linked to cerebellar development2 and seizures3. We had previously demonstrated that GPR37L1 constitutively coupled to Gs and generated ligand-independent increases in intracellular cAMP4[&#167;]. Thus, the inverse agonist activities of computationally predicted surrogates were tested in the cAMP response element luciferase (CRE-luc) reporter gene assay in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells expressing either vector control or what we thought was untagged GPR37L1 in pcDNA3.1. However, we recently discovered that the GPR37L1 construct used in that study was incorrect: instead of pcDNA3.1, it carried the receptor inserted backwards into a yeast p426GPD vector (hereafter referred to as p426-r37L1). Here, we correct the cloning error and describe our subsequent unsuccessful efforts to re-test the computationally predicted GPR37L1 ligands (triggering an author-initiated retraction of1).\n\nNoteWe, the authors, are working with the Nature Chemical Biology Editors to retract our 2017 paper  Orphan receptor ligand discovery by pickpocketing pharmacological neighbors1. The present manuscript is under review at Nature Chemical Biology as a Matters Arising accompaniment to the anticipated author-initiated retraction. We initiated the steps towards the retraction upon discovering a regrettable cloning error that put into question the in vitro findings reported in1. This action was unanimously agreed upon by all authors. The computational aspects of the original manuscript1 are unaffected by this error.",

    "abstract": "The methylome and transcriptome signature following exercise that is physiologically and metabolic relevant to sporting contexts such as team sports or health prescription scenarios (e.g. high intensity interval training/HIIT) has not been investigated. To explore this, we undertook two different sport/exercise relevant high-intensity sprint running protocols in humans using a repeated measures design of: 1) Change of direction (COD) versus; 2) straight line (ST) sprint exercise. We took skeletal muscle biopsies from the vastus lateralis 30 minutes and 24 hours post exercise followed by 850K methylation arrays and comparative analysis with recent sprint and acute aerobic exercise meta-analysis transcriptomes. Despite matched intensity (speed x distance and number of accelerations/decelerations) between COD and ST exercise, COD exercise elicited greater movement (GPS Playerload), physiological (HR), metabolic (lactate) as well as central and peripheral (differential RPE) loading compared with ST exercise. The exercise response alone across both conditions evoked extensive alterations in the methylome immediately post and 24 hrs after exercise, particularly in MAPK, AMPK and axon guidance pathways. COD evoked a considerably greater hypomethylated signature across the genome compared with ST sprint exercise, particularly enriched in: Protein binding, MAPK, AMPK, insulin, and axon guidance pathways. A finding that was more prominent immediately post exercise. Comparative methylome analysis with sprint running transcriptomes identified considerable overlap, with 49% of the genes altered at the expression level also differentially methylated after COD exercise. After differential methylated region analysis, we discovered that VEGFA and its downstream nuclear transcription factor, NR4A1 had enriched hypomethylation within their promoter regions. VEGFA and NR4A1 were also significantly upregulated in the sprint transcriptome and meta-analysis of exercise transcriptomes. We confirmed increased mRNA expression of VEGFA, and considerably larger increases in the expression of canonical metabolic genes, PGC1- and NR4A3, 3 hrs post COD vs. ST exercise. Overall, we demonstrate that increased physiological load via change of direction sprint exercise in human skeletal muscle evokes considerable epigenetic modifications that are associated with changes in expression of genes responsible for adaptation to exercise. These data imply that introducing changes in direction into high intensity running protocols could serve as an important modulator of a favourable epigenomic and transcriptomic landscape in response to exercise in athletes and trigger greater skeletal muscle remodelling through enhanced gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Defects of filaggrin (FLG) compromise epidermal barrier function and represent an important known genetic risk factor for atopic dermatitis (AD), but also for systemic atopy, including allergic sensitization and asthma. The flaky tail mouse model, widely used to address mechanisms of atopy induction by barrier-defective skin, harbors two mutations that affect the skin barrier, the mutation Flgft, resulting in near-complete loss of FLG expression, and the matted mutation inactivating transmembrane protein 79 (Tmem79). Upon separation of the two mutant loci, which are closely linked on chromosome 3, mice defective only for Tmem79 featured pronounced dermatitis and systemic atopy. Upon extensive backcross to BALB/c, also Flgft/ft mice (assumed to be wild type for Tmem79), developed AD-like dermatitis and reproduced the human  atopic march, with high IgE levels and spontaneous asthma, suggesting a key role for functional Flg in protection from atopy also in mice. In contrast, BALB/c mice congenic for a targeted Flg knock out mutation did not develop skin inflammation or atopy. To resolve this discrepancy, we generated Flg-deficient mice on a pure BALB/c background by inactivating the Flg gene in BALB/c embryos. These animals feature an ichthyosis phenotype, but do not develop spontaneous dermatitis or systemic atopy. We sequenced the genome of the atopic Flgft BALB/c congenics and discovered that they were unexpectedly homozygous for the atopy-causing Tmem79matted mutation. In summary, we show that Flg-deficiency does not cause atopy in mice. This finding is in line with lack of atopic disease in a fraction of Ichthyosis vulgaris patients carrying two FLG null alleles. However, absence of FLG may promote and modulate dermatitis caused by other genetic barrier defects, as skin inflammation in Tmem79ma/maFlgft/ft BALB/c congenics is qualitatively different compared to Tmem79ma/ma mice.",

    "abstract": "Aging and immunity are inextricably linked and many genes that extend lifespan also enhance immunoresistance. However, it remains unclear if longevity-enhancing factors modulate immunity and longevity by distinct or shared mechanisms. Here, we demonstrate that the Caenorhabditis elegans pro-longevity factor, NHR-49, also promotes resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but modulates immunity and longevity by spatially and mechanistically distinct mechanisms. Fenofibrate, an agonist of NHR-49s mammalian functional homolog, PPAR, enhanced worm immunoresistance in an NHR-49-dependent manner. NHR-49 expression is increased by germline ablation, an intervention that extends lifespan, but lowered by pathogen exposure. NHR-49 acted in multiple somatic tissues to promote longevity, whereas, its pro-immunity function was mediated by neuronal expression. The canonical NHR-49 target genes, acs-2 and fmo-2, were upregulated by germline loss, but infection triggered fmo-2 downregulation and acs-2 upregulation. Interestingly, neither gene conferred resistance against Gram-negative Pseudomonas, unlike their reported roles in immunity against Gram-positive pathogens. Thus, NHR-49 is differentially regulated by interventions that bring about long-term changes (lifespan extension) vs. short-term stress (pathogen exposure) and in response it orchestrates distinct outputs, including pathogen-specific transcriptional programs. Overall, our study demonstrates the independent control of immunity and longevity by a conserved regulatory protein.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease characterized by CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) dysfunction. With over 2000 CFTR variants identified, in addition to known patient to patient variability, there is a need for personalized treatment. The discovery of CFTR modulators has shown efficacy in certain CF populations, however there are still CF populations without valid therapeutic options. With evidence suggesting that single drug therapeutics are insufficient for optimal management of CF disease, there has been an increased pursuit of combinatorial therapies. Our aim was to test cyclic AMP (cAMP) modulation, through ATP Binding Cassette Transporter C4 (ABCC4) and phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibition, as a potential add-on therapeutic to a clinically approved CFTR modulator, VX-770, as a method for increasing CFTR activity. Human airway epithelial cells (Calu-3) were used to test the efficacy of cAMP modulation by ABCC4 and PDE-4 inhibition through a series of concentration-response studies. Our results showed that cAMP modulation, in combination with VX-770, led to an increase in CFTR activity via an increase in sensitivity when compared to treatment of VX-770 alone. Our study suggests that cAMP modulation has potential to be pursued as an add-on therapy for the optimal management of CF disease.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of a massive vertebral deformity was recorded in the radiating Labeobarbus assemblage from the middle reaches of the Genale River (south-eastern Ethiopia, East Africa). Within this sympatric assemblage, five trophic morphs - generalized, lipped, piscivorous and two scraping feeders - were reported between 1993 and 2019. In 2009, a new morph with prevalence of [~]10% was discovered. The new morph, termed  short, had an abnormally shortened vertebral column and a significantly heightened body. This type of deformity is common in farmed Atlantic salmon and other artificially reared fish, but is rare in nature. In the Genale Labeobarbus assemblage, the deformity was present exclusively within the generalized and lipped morphs. The short morph had between seven and 36 deformed (compressed and/or fused) vertebrae. Their body height was positively correlated with number of deformed vertebrae. In another collection in 2019, the short morph was still present at a frequency of 11%. Various environmental and genetic factors could contribute to the development of this deformity in the Genale Labeobarbus, but based on the available data, it is impossible to confidently identify the key factor(s). Whether the result of genetics, the environment, or both, this high-bodied phenotype is assumed to be an anti-predator adaptation, as there is evidence of its selective advantage in the generalized morph. The Genale \"monstrosity\" is the first reported case of a massive deformity of the vertebral column in a natural population of African fishes.\n\n\"We have also what are called monstrosities; but they graduate into varieties. By a monstrosity I presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure in one part, either injurious to or not useful to the species, and not generally propagated. If it could be shown that monstrosities were even propagated for a succession of generations in a state of nature, modifications might be effected (with the aid of natural selection) more abruptly than I am inclined to believe they are.\" Darwin (1860, pp. 46, 426).",

As part of a clinical trial looking at the effects of Tocilizumab treatment on kidney transplant recipients with subclinical rejection, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing of comparing stimulated PBMCs before and after Tocilizumab treatment. We leveraged this data to create an in vitro cytokine storm model, to better understand the effects of Tocilizumab in the presence of inflammation. Tocilizumab-treated cells had reduced expression of inflammatory-mediated genes and biologic pathways, particularly amongst monocytes.

In contrast, in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) we have previously reported that EZH2 plays a non-canonical role as a transcriptional activator. In this setting, we now show that EZH2 inhibitors can also block the non-canonical activity of EZH2 and inhibit the growth of CRPC cells. Gene expression and epigenomic profiling of cells treated with EZH2 inhibitors demonstrated that rather than de-repressing tumor suppressor genes silenced by PRC2, EZH2 inhibitors downregulate a set of DNA repair genes that are directly regulated by EZH2. In addition, genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9-mediated loss-of-function screens in the presence of EZH2 inhibitors identified these DNA repair genes to underlie the growth-inhibitory function of these compounds. Interrogation of public data from diverse solid tumor types expressing wild-type EZH2 showed that expression of DNA damage repair genes is significantly correlated with cellular sensitivity to EZH2 inhibitors. Consistent with these findings, treatment of CRPC cells with EZH2 inhibitors dramatically enhanced their sensitivity to genotoxic stress. These studies reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism of action of EZH2 inhibitors and provide a mechanistic basis for potential new combination cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "Legionella longbeachae is an environmental bacterium that is commonly found in soil and composted plant material. In New Zealand (NZ) it is the most clinically significant Legionella species causing around two-thirds of all notified cases of Legionnaires disease. Here we report the sequencing and analysis of the geo-temporal genetic diversity of 54 L. longbeachae serogroup 1 (sg1) clinical isolates that were derived from cases from around NZ over a 22-year period, including one complete genome and its associated methylome.\n\nOur complete genome consisted of a 4.1 Mb chromosome and a 108 kb plasmid. The genome was highly methylated with two known epigenetic modifications, m4C and m6A, occurring in particular sequence motifs within the genome. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the 54 sg1 isolates belonged to two main clades that last shared a common ancestor between 108 BCE and 1608 CE. These isolates also showed diversity at the genome-structural level, with large-scale arrangements occurring in some regions of the chromosome and evidence of extensive chromosomal and plasmid recombination. This includes the presence of plasmids derived from recombination and horizontal gene transfer between various Legionella species, indicating there has been both intra-species and inter-species gene flow. However, because similar plasmids were found among isolates within each clade, plasmid recombination events may pre-empt the emergence of new L. longbeachae strains.\n\nOur high-quality reference genome and extensive genetic diversity data will serve as a platform for future work linking genetic, epigenetic and functional diversity in this globally important emerging environmental pathogen.\n\nAuthor SummaryLegionnaires disease is a serious, sometimes fatal pneumonia caused by bacteria of the genus Legionella. In New Zealand, the species that causes the majority of disease is Legionella longbeachae. Although the analyses of pathogenic bacterial genomes is an important tool for unravelling evolutionary relationships and identifying genes and pathways that are associated with their disease-causing ability, until recently genomic data for L. longbeachae has been sparse. Here, we conducted a large-scale genomic analysis of 54 L. longbeachae isolates that had been obtained from people hospitalised with Legionnaires disease between 1993 and 2015 from 8 regions around New Zealand. Based on our genome analysis the isolates could be divided into two main groups that persisted over time and last shared a common ancestor up to 1700 years ago. Analysis of the bacterial chromosome revealed areas of high modification through the addition of methyl groups and these were associated with particular DNA sequence motifs. We also found there have been large-scale rearrangements in some regions of the chromosome, producing variability between the different L. longbeacahe strains, as well as evidence of gene-flow between the various Legionella species via the exchange of plasmid DNA.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHemorrhagic stroke is associated with loss of middle cerebral artery (MCA) autoregulation in the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHRsp). The signaling mechanism associated with the functional loss has yet to be defined. We hypothesize that physiological alterations coincide with changes to cerebrovascular inflammatory and contractile signaling and altered calcium signaling. METHODS: SHRsp rats were fed a high salt (4% NaCl) diet and sacrificed at 9 weeks of age for pre-stroke and after evidence of stroke for post-stroke samples. The MCAs were isolated for measuring protein levels using immunofluorescence (IF) & western blot (WB) for inflammatory signaling and contractile proteins. Tissues surrounding the MCA were analyzed for neuro-inflammation, neuronal damage, total and activated inflammatory proteins (ERK1/2 and p38MAPK), cerebrovascular contraction (PKC and MLC), and transient receptor potential V4 (TRPV4) expression. RESULTS: Our data show increase in activated inflammatory proteins after stroke with an associated decrease in expression of activated contractile proteins and TRPV4 channel expression compared to pre-stroke MCA. The post-stroke samples also show significant increase in neuro-inflammation and neuronal damage compared to pre-stroke samples.\n\nCONCLUSIONAn increase in activated/total (p38 MAPK &ERK1/2) is accompanied by a decrease in activated/total PKC & TRPV4 channel expression in post-stroke SHRsps. The decrease in vessel structural integrity and altered vascular tone of the MCAs may affect its ability to contract in response to pressure. Significant neuro-inflammation and neuronal damage in the brain tissues surrounding the MCA in post-stroke samples suggest MCA dysfunction is accompanied with neuronal and neural damage during stroke.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical forces are essential for proper growth and remodeling of the primitive pharyngeal arch arteries (PAAs) into the great vessels of the heart. Despite general acknowledgement of a link between abnormal hemodynamics and cardiac malformations, the direct correlation between hemodynamics and pharyngeal arch artery morphogenesis remains poorly understood. The elusiveness behind understanding hemodynamic-malformation links is largely due to the difficulty of performing isolated hemodynamic perturbations and quantifying key hemodynamic indices in-vivo. To overcome this issue, minimally invasive occlusion experiments were combined with three-dimensional anatomical models of development and in-silico testing of experimental phenomenon. This combined experimental-computational approach led to a mechanistic understanding of physiological compensation mechanisms in abnormal cardiac morphogenesis. Using our experimental-based framework, we detail morphological and hemodynamic changes twenty-four hours post vessel occlusion. To gain mechanistic insights into the dynamic vessel adaptation process, we perform in-silico occlusions which allow for quantification of instantaneous changes in mechanical loading. We follow the propagation of small defects in a single embryo Hamburger Hamilton (HH) Stage 18 embryo to a more serious defect in an HH29 embryo. Results demonstrate that abnormal PAA hemodynamics can precipitate abnormal cardiac function given the correct timing and location of injury. Following vessel occlusion, morphology changes along the arches are no longer a simple flow-mediated response but rather work to maintain a range of wall shear stress values. Occlusion of the presumptive aortic arch overrides natural growth mechanisms and prevents it from becoming the dominant arch of the aorta.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe developing great vessels transport flow from the heart to the rest of the body. Proper spatial temporal morphogenesis of the primitive paired vessels into the definitive outflow tract of the heart is critical for normal cardiac function. Malpatterning of the great vessels is highly prevalent in congenital heart defects and occurs in conjunction with other intracardiac malformations, such as impaired ventricle and valve development. In this work, we combine experimental-based computational modeling with theoretical adaptation principles. Our combined experimental-computational framework allows for the delineation of immediate and longer-term vascular remodeling as well as the physical mechanisms behind such changes. We show that a small flow obstruction originating within the developing vessels can propagate into structurally serious malformations with impaired functionality.",

    "abstract": "Haplolethals (HL) are regions of diploid genomes that in one dose are fatal for the organism. Their biological meaning is obscure, given that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations will result in dominant lethality and, consequently, should be under strong negative selection. In addition, their biological nature is under debate: a chromosomal structure that is essential for the expression of several genes (regulatory hypothesis), or the strict dosage requirement of one particular gene (functional hypothesis). We report the first in depth study of an haplolethal region, the one associated to the Drosophila gene wings up A (wupA). It encodes 13 transcripts (A-M) that yield 11 protein isoforms (A-K) of Troponin I (TnI). They are functionally diverse in their control of muscle contraction, cell polarity and cell proliferation. Isoform K can transfer to the nucleus where it increases the transcription of the cell proliferation related genes CDK2, CDK4, Rap and Rab5. The nuclear translocation of isoform K is prevented by the co-expression of A or B isoforms, which illustrates isoform interactions. The corresponding dominant lethal mutations (DL) result from DNA rearrangements, clustered in the intron between exons 7-8, and affect the genomic organization of all transcripts. The joint elimination of isoforms C, F, G and H, however, do not cause DL phenotypes. Genetically driven expression of single isoforms rescue neither DL nor any of the mutants known in the gene, suggesting that normal function of wupA requires the properly regulated expression of specific combinations, rather than single, TnI isoforms along development. We conclude that the HL function at wupA results from the combined haploinsufficiency of a large set of TnI isoforms. The qualitative and quantitative normal expression of which, requires the chromosomal integrity of the wupA genomic region. Since all fly TnI isoforms are encoded in the same gene, its HL condition becomes unavoidable.\n\nAuthor summaryMost species contain two copies of their genetic endowment, each received from their progenitors. If one of the duplicated genes is non-functional, due to either null mutations or genomic loss, the remaining gene copy may supply enough product as to cover the requirements for normal function or, alternatively, may reflect the insufficiency through a visible phenotype. In rare occasions, however, mutation in one copy is so deleterious that causes lethality, usually at early stages of development. These so called \"haplolethal regions\", exist across species and represent an evolutionary paradox since they should have been subject to intense negative selection. The inherent difficulties to study haplolethals have precluded their study so far. Here, we analyzed the case of one of the five haplolethal regions of Drosophila, the one associated to the Troponin I encoding gene wupA, by measuring the transcriptional effects of mutations and chromosomal rearrangements affecting this gene. The data show that haplolethality results from the combined insufficiency of a large number of Troponin I isoforms, which are functionally specialized, show interference and require the integrity of the native chromatin structure for their quantitatively regulated expression. These features unveil novel aspects of gene expression and, possibly, on evolutionary gene splitting.",

    "abstract": "In transcription initiation, specific contacts between RNA polymerase (RNAP) and promoter DNA are disrupted as the RNA-DNA hybrid advances into the cleft, resulting in escape of RNAP. From the pattern of large and small rate constants for steps of initiation at {lambda}PR promoter at 19{degrees}C, we proposed that in-cleft interactions are disrupted in extending 3-mer to 5-mer RNA, -10 interactions are disrupted in extending 6-mer to 9-mer, and -35 interactions are disrupted in extending 10-mer to 11-mer, allowing RNAP to escape. Here we test this mechanism and determine enthalpic and entropic activation barriers of all steps from kinetic measurements at 25{degrees}C and 37{degrees}C. Initiation at 37{degrees}C differs significantly from expectations based on lower-temperature results. At low concentration of the second iNTP (UTP), synthesis of full-length RNA at 37{degrees}C is slower than at 25{degrees}C and no transient short RNA intermediates are observed, indicating a UTP-dependent bottleneck step early in the 37{degrees}C mechanism. Analysis reveals that the 37{degrees}C {lambda}PR OC (RPO) cannot initiate and must change conformation to a less-stable initiation complex (IC) capable of binding the iNTP. We find that IC is the primary {lambda}PR OC species below 25{degrees}C, and therefore conclude that IC must be the I3 intermediate in RPO formation. Surprisingly, Arrhenius activation energy barriers to five steps where RNAP-promoter in-cleft and -10 contacts are disrupted are much smaller than for other steps, including a negative barrier for the last of these steps. We interpret these striking effects as enthalpically-favorable, entropically-unfavorable, stepwise bubble collapse accompanying disruption of RNAP contacts.\n\nSignificanceTranscription initiation is highly regulated. To understand regulation, mechanisms of initiation and escape of RNA polymerase (RNAP) from the promoter must be understood. RNAP forms a highly-stable open complex (RPO) with {lambda}PR promoter at 37{degrees}C. From experiments determining effects of temperature on rate constants for each step of RNA synthesis, we find that RPO cannot bind the initiating nucleotides, that the I3 intermediate and not RPO is the initiation complex, and that contacts of RNAP with single-stranded DNA of the discriminator and -10 region and with -35 duplex DNA are disrupted stepwise as the RNA-DNA hybrid moves into the cleft. Evidence is obtained for stepwise bubble collapse and base stacking accompanying disruption of interactions of the single-stranded discriminator and -10 regions with RNAP.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus spreading across the world causing the disease COVID-19. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is done by quantitative reverse-transcription polymer chain reaction (qRT-PCR) testing which utilizes different primer-probe sets depending on the assay used. Using in silico analysis we aimed to determine how the secondary structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the interaction between the reverse primer during qRT-PCR and how it relates to the experimental primer-probe test efficiencies. We introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex Interaction of Nucleic acids with pseudoKnots) that follows the hierarchical folding hypothesis to predict the secondary structure of two interacting nucleic acid strands (DNA/RNA) of similar or different type. DinoKnot is the first program that utilizes stable stems in both strands as a guide to find the structure of their interaction. Using DinoKnot we predicted the interaction of the reverse primers used in four common COVID-19 qRT-PCR tests with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome. In addition, we predicted how 12 mutations in the primer/probe binding region may affect the primer/probe ability and subsequent SARS-CoV-2 detection. While we found all reverse primers are capable of interacting with their target area, we identified partial mismatching between the SARS-CoV-2 genome and some reverse primers. We predicted three mutations that may prevent primer binding, reducing the ability for SARS-CoV-2 detection. We believe our contributions can aid in the design of a more sensitive SARS-CoV-2 test.\n\nAuthor summaryThe current testing for the disease COVID-19 that is caused by the novel cornonavirus SARS-CoV-2 uses oligonucleotides called primers that bind to specific target regions on the SARS-CoV-2 genome to detect the virus. Our goal was to use computational tools to predict how the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA genome affects the ability of the primers to bind to their target region. We introduce the program DinoKnot (Duplex interaction of nucleic acids with pseudoknots) that is able to predict the interactions between two DNA or RNA molecules. We used DinoKnot to predict the efficiency of four common COVID-19 tests, and the effect of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus on ability of the COVID-19 tests in detecting those strains. We predict partial mismatching between some primers and the SARS-CoV-2 genome but that all primers are capable of interacting with their target areas. We also predict three mutations that prevent primer binding and thus SARS-CoV-2 detection. We discuss the limitations of the current COVID-19 testing and suggest the design of a more sensitive COVID-19 test that can be aided by our findings.",

    "abstract": "Tandem alternative splice sites (TASS) is a special class of alternative splicing events that are characterized by a close tandem arrangement of splice sites. Most TASS lack functional characterization and are believed to arise from splicing noise. Based on the RNA-seq data from the Genotype Tissue Expression project, we present an extended catalogue of TASS in healthy human tissues and analyze their tissue-specific expression. The expression of TASS is usually dominated by one major splice site (maSS), while the expression of minor splice sites (miSS) is at least an order of magnitude lower. Among 73k miSS with sufficient read support, 12k (17%) are significantly expressed above the expected noise level, and among them 2k are expressed tissue-specifically. We found significant correlations between tissue-specific expression of RNA-binding proteins (RBP) and tissue-specific expression of miSS that is consistent with miSS response to RBP inactivation by shRNA. In combination with RBP profiling by eCLIP, this allowed prediction of novel cases of tissue-specific splicing regulation including a miSS in QKI mRNA that is likely regulated by PTBP1. According to the structural annotation of the human proteome, tissue-specific miSS are enriched within disordered regions, and indels induced by miSS are enriched with short linear motifs and post-translational modification sites. Nonetheless, more than 15% of tissue-specific miSS affect structured protein regions and may adjust protein-protein interactions or modify the stability of the protein core. The significantly expressed miSS evolve under the same selection pressure as maSS, while other miSS lack signatures of evolutionary selection and conservation. Using mixture models, we estimated that not more than 10% of maSS and not more than 50% of significantly expressed miSS are noisy, while the proportion of noisy splice sites among not significantly expressed miSS is above 70%.",

    "abstract": "Protocadherin-19 belongs to the cadherin family of cell surface receptors and has been shown to play essential roles in the development of the vertebrate nervous system. Mutations in human Protocadherin-19 (PCDH19) lead to PCDH19 Female-limited epilepsy (PCDH19 FLE) in humans, characterized by the early onset of epileptic seizures in children and a range of cognitive and behavioral problems in adults. Despite being considered the second most prevalent gene in epilepsy, very little is known about the intercellular pathways in which it participates. In order to characterize the protein complexes within which Pcdh19 functions, we generated Pcdh19-BioID fusion proteins and utilized proximity-dependent biotinylation to identify neighboring proteins. Proteomic identification and analysis revealed that the Pcdh19 interactome is enriched in proteins that regulate Rho family GTPases, microtubule binding proteins and proteins that regulate cell divisions. We cloned the centrosomal protein Nedd1 and the RacGEF Dock7 and verified their interactions with Pcdh19 in vitro. Our findings provide the first comprehensive insights into the interactome of Pcdh19, and provide a platform for future investigations into the cellular and molecular biology of this protein critical to the proper development of the nervous system.",
