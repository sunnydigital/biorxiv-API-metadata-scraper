    "abstract": "Although originally known as an opportunistic pathogen, Klebsiella pneumoniae has been considered a worldwide health threat nowadays due to the emergence of hypervirulent and antibiotic-resistant strains capable of causing severe infections not only on immunocompromised patients but also on healthy individuals. Fimbriae is an essential virulence factor for K. pneumoniae, especially in urinary tract infections, because it allows the pathogen to adhere and invade urothelial cells and to form biofilms on biotic and abiotic surfaces. The importance of fimbriae for K. pneumoniae pathogenicity is highlighted by the large number of fimbrial gene clusters on the bacterium genome, which requires a coordinated and finely adjusted system to control the synthesis of these structures. In this work, we describe KpfR as a new transcriptional repressor of fimbrial expression in K. pneumoniae and discuss its role in the bacterium pathogenicity. K. pneumoniae lacking the kpfR gene exhibited a hyperfimbriated phenotype with enhanced biofilm formation and greater adhesion to and replication within epithelial host cells. However, the mutant strain was attenuated for colonization of the bladder in a murine model of urinary tract infection. These results indicate that KpfR is an important transcriptional repressor that, by negatively controlling the expression of fimbriae, prevents K. pneumoniae from having a hyperfimbriated phenotype and from being recognized and eliminated by the host immune system.\n\nIMPORTANCEFimbriae are crucial virulence factor for many pathogens because they allow the pathogen to adhere and invade host cells and to form biofilm on biotic and abiotic surfaces. However, the synthesis of fimbriae requires a precise and coordinated control to guarantees the production of these structures only when necessary, thus avoiding unnecessary energy expenditure and bacterial clearance by the host immune cells. Herein, we describe for the first time the role of the transcriptional repressor of fimbrial expression KpfR on the pathogenicity of K. pneumoniae, a Gram-negative pathogen that has gained worldwide attention, notably for being the causative agent of severe and metastatic infections even on healthy individuals. By deleting the kpfR gene, we show that the mutant strain loses the control of fimbriae production, resulting in a hyperfimbriated phenotype that impairs K. pneumoniae ability to colonize a murine model of urinary tract infection.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria grow in constantly changing environments that can suddenly become completely deleted in essential nutrients. The stringent response, a rewiring of the cellular metabolism mediated by the alarmone (p)ppGpp, plays a crucial role in adjusting bacterial growth to the severity of the nutritional insult. The ability of (p)ppGpp to trigger a slowdown of cell growth or induce bacterial dormancy has been widely investigated. However, little is known about the role of (p)ppGpp in promoting growth recovery after severe growth inhibition. In this study, we performed a time-resolved analysis of (p)ppGpp metabolism in Escherichia coli as it recovered from a sudden slowdown in growth. Results show that E. coli recovers by itself from the growth disruption provoked by the addition of serine hydroxamate, the serine analogue that we used to induce the stringent response. Growth inhibition was accompanied by a severe disturbance of metabolic activity and more surprisingly, by a transient overflow of valine and alanine. Our data also show that ppGpp is crucial for growth recovery since in the absence of ppGpp, E. colis growth recovery was slower. In contrast, an increased concentration of pppGpp was found to have no significant effect on growth recovery. Interestingly, the observed decrease in intracellular ppGpp levels in the recovery phase correlated with bacterial growth and the main effect involved was identified as growth dilution rather than active degradative process. This report thus significantly expands our knowledge of (p)ppGpp metabolism in E. coli physiology.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe capacity of microbes to resist and overcome environmental insults, know as resilience, allows them to survive in changing environments but also to resist antibiotic and biocide treatments, immune system responses. Although the role of the stringent response in bacterial resilience to nutritional insults has been well studied, little is known about its importance in the ability of the bacteria to not just resist but also recover from these disturbances. To address this important question, we investigated growth disruption resilience in the model bacterium Escherichia coli and its dependency on the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp by quantifying ppGpp and pppGpp levels as growth was disrupted and then recovered. Our findings may thus contribute to understanding how ppGpp improves E. colis resilience to nutritional stress and other environmental insults.",

    "abstract": "Across tissues, gene expression is regulated by a combination of determinants, including the binding of transcription factors (TFs), along with other aspects of cellular state. Recent studies emphasize the importance of both genetic and epigenetic states - TF binding sites and binding site chromatin accessibility have emerged as potentially causal determinants of tissue specificity. To investigate the relative contributions of these determinants, we constructed three genome-scale datasets for both root and shoot tissues of the same Arabidopsis thaliana plants: TSS-seq data to identify Transcription Start Sites, OC-seq data to identify regions of Open Chromatin, and RNA-seq data to assess gene expression levels. For genes that are differentially expressed between root and shoot, we constructed a machine learning model predicting tissue of expression from chromatin accessibility and TF binding information upstream of TSS locations. The resulting model was highly accurate (over 90% auROC and auPRC), and our analysis of model contributions (feature weights) strongly suggests that patterns of TF binding sites within [~]500 nt TSS-proximal regions are predominant explainers of tissue of expression in most cases. Thus, in plants, cis-regulatory control of tissue-specific gene expression appears to be primarily determined by TSS-proximal sequences, and rarely by distal enhancer-like accessible chromatin regions. This study highlights the exciting future possibility of a native TF site-based design process for the tissue-specific targeting of plant gene promoters.",

    "abstract": "The M2 pyruvate kinase (PKM2) isoform is upregulated in most cancers and plays a crucial role in the Warburg effect, which is characterized by the preference for aerobic glycolysis for energy metabolism. PKM2 is an alternative-splice isoform of the PKM gene and is a potential therapeutic target. Previously, we developed antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that switch PKM splicing from the cancer-associated PKM2 to the PKM1 isoform and induce apoptosis in cultured glioblastoma cells. Here, we explore the potential of ASO-based PKM splice-switching as a targeted therapy for liver cancer. We utilize a more potent lead cEt/DNA ASO and demonstrate that it induces PKM splice-switching and inhibits the growth of cultured hepatocellular-carcinoma (HCC) cells. This PKM isoform switch increases pyruvate-kinase activity and alters glucose metabolism. The lead ASO and a second ASO targeting a non-overlapping site inhibit tumorigenesis in an orthotopic-xenograft HCC mouse model. Finally, a surrogate mouse-specific ASO induces Pkm splice-switching and inhibits HCC growth, without observable toxicity, in a genetic HCC mouse model. These results lay the groundwork for a potential ASO therapy for HCC.\n\nStatement of significanceAntisense oligonucleotides are used to force a change in PKM isoform usage in HCC, reversing the Warburg effect and inhibiting tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cell softening increases with the progression of the disease, suggesting that mechanical phenotyping could be used as a diagnostic or prognostic method. Here we investigate the cell mechanics of gliomas, brain tumors that originate from glial cells or glial progenitors. We use two microrheology techniques, a single cell parallel plates rheometer to probe whole cell mechanics and optical-tweezers to probe intracellular rheology. We show that cell mechanics discriminates human glioma cells of different grades. When probed globally, grade IV glioblastoma cells are softer than grade III astrocytoma cells, while they are surprisingly stiffer at the intracellular level. We explain this difference between global and local intracellular behaviours by changes in the composition and spatial organization of the cytoskeleton and by changes in nuclear mechanics. Our study highlights the need to combine rheology techniques for potential diagnostic or prognostic methods based on cancer cell mechanophenotyping.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3-D) neutrophil migration is essential for immune surveillance and inflammatory responses. During 3-D migration, especially through extravascular spaces, neutrophils rely on frontal protrusions and rear contractions to squeeze and maneuver through extracellular matrices containing narrow pores. However, the role of matrix density and the cells ability to probe and remodel matrix pores during 3-D chemotaxis are far from being understood. We investigated these processes by tracking the trajectories of over 20,000 neutrophils in a 3-D migration device containing collagen matrices of varying concentrations and analyzing the shape of these trajectories at multiple scales. Additionally, we quantified the transient 3-D matrix deformations caused by the migrating cells. The mean pore size of our reconstituted collagen matrices decreased when the collagen concentration ([col]) was increased. In low-[col] matrices, neutrophils exerted large transient deformations and migrated in relatively straight trajectories. In contrast, they were not able to appreciably deform high- [col] matrices and adapted to this inability by turning more often to circumvent these narrow matrix pores. While this adaptation resulted in slower migration, the cells were able to balance the more frequent turning with the long-range directional bias necessary for chemotaxis. Based on our statistical analysis of cell trajectories, we postulate that neutrophils achieve this balance by using matrix obstacles as pivoting points to steer their motion towards the chemoattractant. Inhibiting myosin-II contractility or Arp2/3-mediated pseudopod protrusions not only compromised the cells ability to deform the matrix, but also made them switch to increased turning in more restrictive matrices when compared to untreated control cells. Both myosin-II contractility and Arp2/3-mediated branched polymerization of actin played a role in fast migration, but Arp2/3 was also crucial for neutrophils when coordinating the orientations of successive turns to prevent veering away from the chemotactic path. These results may contribute to an improved understanding of the mechanisms employed by migrating neutrophils in confined 3-D environments, as well as the molecular and environmental regulators for maintaining persistent motion.",

    "abstract": "The classic basal ganglia circuit model asserts a complete segregation of the two striatal output pathways. Empirical data argue that, in addition to indirect-pathway striatal projection neurons (iSPNs), direct-pathway striatal projection neurons (dSPNs) innervate the external globus pallidus (GPe). However, the functions of the latter were not known. In this study, we interrogated the organization principles of striatopallidal projections and their roles in full-body movement in mice (both males and females). In contrast to the canonical motor-promoting response of dSPNs in the dorsomedial striatum (DMSdSPNs), optogenetic stimulation of dSPNs in the dorsolateral striatum (DLSdSPNs) suppressed locomotion. Circuit analyses revealed that dSPNs selectively target Npas1+ neurons in the GPe. In a chronic 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model of Parkinsons disease, the dSPN-Npas1+ projection was dramatically strengthened. As DLSdSPN-Npas1+ projection suppresses movement, the enhancement of this projection represents a circuit mechanism for the hypokinetic symptoms of Parkinsons disease that has not been previously considered. In sum, our results suggest that dSPN input to the GPe is a critical circuit component that is involved in the regulation of movement in both healthy and parkinsonian states.\n\nSignificance statementIn the classic basal ganglia model, the striatum is described as a divergent structure--it controls motor and adaptive functions through two segregated, opposing output streams. However, the experimental results that show the projection from direct-pathway neurons to the external pallidum have been largely ignored. Here, we showed that this striatopallidal sub-pathway targets a select subset of neurons in the external pallidum and is motor-suppressing. We found that this sub-pathway undergoes changes in a Parkinsons disease model. In particular, our results suggest that the increase in strength of this sub-pathway contributes to the slowness or reduced movements observed in Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "Disinfection by-products (DBPs) are compounds produced during the water disinfection process. Iodoacetic acid (IAA) is one of the unregulated DBPs in drinking water, with potent cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in animals. However, whether IAA has toxic effects on oocyte maturation remains unclear. Here, we show that IAA exposure resulted in metaphase I (MI) arrest and polar-body-extrusion failure in mouse oocytes, indicating that IAA had adverse effects on mouse oocyte maturation in vitro. Particularly, IAA treatment caused abnormal spindle assembly and chromosome misalignment. Previous studies reported that IAA is a known inducer of oxidative stress in non-germline cells. Correspondingly, we found that IAA exposure increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in oocytes in a dose-dependent manner, indicating IAA exposure could induce oxidative stress in oocytes. Simultaneously, DNA damage was also elevated in the nuclei of these IAA-exposed mouse oocytes, evidenced by increased {gamma}-H2AX focus number. In addition, the un-arrested oocytes entered metaphase II (MII) with severe defects in spindle morphologies and chromosome alignment after 14-hour IAA treatment. An antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), reduced the elevated ROS level and restored the meiotic maturation in the IAA. exposed oocytes, which indicates that IAA-induced maturation failure in oocytes was mainly mediated by oxidative stress. Collectively, our results indicate that IAA exposure interfered with mouse oocyte maturation by elevating ROS levels, disrupting spindle assembly, inducing DNA damage, and causing MI arrest.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) allow cells to respond to chemical and sensory stimuli through generation of second messengers, such as cyclic AMP (cAMP), which in turn mediate a myriad of processes, including cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. In order to gain deeper insights into the complex biology and physiology of these key cellular pathways, it is critical to be able to globally map the molecular factors that shape cascade function. Yet, to this date, efforts to systematically identify regulators of GPCR/cAMP signaling have been lacking. Here, we combined genome-wide screening based on CRISPR interference with a novel sortable transcriptional reporter that provides robust readout for cAMP signaling, and carried out a functional screen for regulators of the pathway. Due to the sortable nature of the platform, we were able to assay regulators with strong and weaker phenotypes by analyzing sgRNA distribution among three fractions with distinct reporter expression. We identified 45 regulators with strong and 50 regulators with weaker phenotypes not previously known to be involved in cAMP signaling. In follow-up experiments, we validated the functional effects of seven newly discovered mediators (NUP93, PRIM1, RUVBL1, PKMYT1, TP53, SF3A2, and HRAS), and showed that they control distinct steps of the pathway. Thus, our study provides proof of principle that the screening platform can be applied successfully to identify bona fide regulators of GPCR/second messenger cascades in an unbiased and high-throughput manner, and illuminates the remarkable functional diversity among GPCR regulators.\n\nAuthor summaryCells sense and respond to changes in their surrounding environment through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their associated cascades. The proper function of these pathways is essential to human physiology, and GPCRs have become a prime target for drug development for a range of human diseases. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to be able to map how these pathways operate to enable cells to fine-tune their responsiveness. Here, we describe a screening approach that we have devised to systematically identify regulators of GPCR function. We have developed a sortable reporter system and coupled that with silencing of genes across the entire human genome in order to uncover a range of novel mediators of GPCR activity. We characterize a few of these new regulators and show that they function at different steps of the cascade. Therefore, this study serves as proof of principle for the new screening platform. We envision that the approach can be used to dissect additional dimensions of GPCR function, including regulators of drug-specific responses, functional characterization of receptor features, and identification of novel drugs, and thus advance a genome-scale understanding of these critical pathways.",

We developed an approach for locally triggering secretory trafficking from specific subcellular domains to explore the rate, activity dependence and cargo-specificity of central and remote trafficking networks. Surprisingly, different postsynaptic proteins processed in the cell body were transported deep into dendrites, but with strikingly different kinetics, spatial distributions and activity dependencies. Proteins locally processed in dendrites were broadly dispersed prior to surface insertion, but could be directed locally to synapses.

    "abstract": "The interactions between different intra-cellular organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum, have recently been in focus thanks to the tremendous progress in imaging them using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. However, they are still difficult to study in cellulo, and reconstituting these systems has been a standing challenge. Here we achieve this task using a giant unilamellar vesicle (GUV) and supported lipid bilayer (SLB) system. The tethers, which may reside in the cytosol when unbound, are mimicked by single (or double) stranded DNA sequences of two different lengths with ends that are self-sticky, and with terminal cholesterol moieties which insert into GUV or SLB membranes. The DNA-tethers, bound by their sticky-end, can exist in two possible states - either with both cholesterols in the same membrane or each cholesterol in a different membrane, the latter conformation leading to adhesion. Exchange of tether-molecules between the membranes occurs through the aqueous phase. By developing theoretical arguments that are supported in our experiments, we show that this possibility of exchange and the relative difference in the projected area between the two states drives the adhesion due to collective entropic considerations, rather than the usually considered enthalpy of binding. The establishment of this fundamentally different interaction between two membranes suggests that in physiological conditions, the regulation of contact formation inside cells may be very different from the case of the much studied ligand-receptor pairing on the external cell membrane.",

    "abstract": "To identify signaling pathways activated by oxycodone self-administration (SA), Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered oxycodone for 20 days using short-access (ShA, 3 h) and long-access (LgA, 9 h) paradigms. Animals were euthanized two hours after SA cessation and dorsal striata were used in post-mortem molecular analyses. LgA rats escalated their oxycodone intake and separated into lower (LgA-L) or higher (LgA-H) oxycodone takers. LgA-H rats showed increased striatal protein phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and MSK1/2. Histone H3, phosphorylated at serine 10 and acetylated at lysine 14 (H3S10pK14Ac), a MSK1/2 target, showed increased abundance only in LgA-H rats. RT-qPCR analyses revealed increased AMPA receptor subunits, GluA2 and GluA3 mRNAs in the LgA-H rats. GluA3, but not GluA2, expression correlated positively with changes in pMSK1/2 and H3S10pK14Ac. Our findings indicate that escalated oxycodone SA results in MSK1/2-dependent histone phosphorylation, which promoted increases in striatal gene expression. Our observations offer novel avenues for pharmacological interventions against oxycodone addiction.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are advancing into human clinical trials, with emphasis on eliciting high titres of neutralising antibodies against the viral spike (S). However, the merits of broadly targeting S versus focusing antibody onto the smaller receptor binding domain (RBD) are unclear. Here we assessed prototypic S and RBD subunit vaccines in homologous or heterologous prime-boost regimens in mice and non-human primates. We find S is highly immunogenic in mice, while the comparatively poor immunogenicity of RBD was associated with limiting germinal centre and T follicular helper cell activity. Boosting S-primed mice with either S or RBD significantly augmented neutralising titres, with RBD-focussing driving moderate improvement in serum neutralisation. In contrast, both S and RBD vaccines were comparably immunogenic in macaques, eliciting serological neutralising activity that generally exceed levels in convalescent humans. These studies confirm recombinant S proteins as promising vaccine candidates and highlight multiple pathways to achieving potent serological neutralisation.",

    "abstract": "A spike protein mutation D614G became dominant in SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an \"up\" conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for disease control and prevention. A spike protein mutation D614G emerged and became dominant soon after the pandemic started. By engineering the D614G mutation into an authentic wild-type SARS-CoV-2 strain, we demonstrate the importance of this mutation to (i) enhanced viral replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, (ii) improved viral fitness in the upper airway of infected hamsters, and (iii) increased susceptibility to neutralization. Together with clinical findings, our work underscores the importance of this mutation in viral spread, vaccine efficacy, and antibody therapy.",

    "abstract": "People with underlying conditions, including hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, are especially susceptible to negative outcomes after infection with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. These COVID-19 comorbidities are exacerbated by the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), which normally protects from rapidly dropping blood pressure or dehydration via the peptide Angiotensin II (Ang II) produced by the enzyme Ace. The Ace paralog Ace2 degrades Ang II, thus counteracting its chronic effects. Ace2 is also the SARS-CoV-2 receptor. Ace, the coronavirus, and COVID-19 comorbidities all regulate Ace2, but we dont yet understand how. To exploit zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a disease model to understand mechanisms regulating the RAAS and its relationship to COVID-19 comorbidities, we must first identify zebrafish orthologs and co-orthologs of human RAAS genes, and second, understand where and when these genes are expressed in specific cells in zebrafish development. To achieve these goals, we conducted genomic analyses and investigated single cell transcriptomes. Results showed that most human RAAS genes have an ortholog in zebrafish and some have two or more co-orthologs. Results further identified a specific intestinal cell type in zebrafish larvae as the site of expression for key RAAS components, including Ace, Ace2, the coronavirus co-receptor Slc6a19, and the Angiotensin-related peptide cleaving enzymes Anpep and Enpep. Results also identified specific vascular cell subtypes as expressing Ang II receptors, apelin, and apelin receptor genes. These results identify specific genes and cell types to exploit zebrafish as a disease model for understanding the mechanisms leading to COVID-19 comorbidities.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTGenomic analyses identify zebrafish orthologs of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System that contribute to COVID-19 comorbidities and single-cell transcriptomics show that they act in a specialized intestinal cell type.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 have been carefully monitored since the COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019, however, analysis has focused primarily on single nucleotide polymorphisms and largely ignored the role of structural variants (SVs) as well as recombination in SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Using sequences from the GISAID database, we catalogue over 100 insertions and deletions in the SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences. We hypothesize that these indels are artifacts of imperfect homologous recombination between SARS-CoV-2 replicates, and provide four independent pieces of evidence. (1) The SVs from the GISAID consensus sequences are clustered at specific regions of the genome. (2) These regions are also enriched for 5 and 3 breakpoints in the transcription regulatory site (TRS) independent transcriptome, presumably sites of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) template-switching. (3) Within raw reads, these structural variant hotspots have cases of both high intra-host heterogeneity and intra-host homogeneity, suggesting that these structural variants are both consequences of de novo recombination events within a host and artifacts of previous recombination. (4) Within the RNA secondary structure, the indels occur in \"arms\" of the predicted folded RNA, suggesting that secondary structure may be a mechanism for TRS-independent template-switching in SARS-CoV-2 or other coronaviruses. These insights into the relationship between structural variation and recombination in SARS-CoV-2 can improve our reconstructions of the SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary history as well as our understanding of the process of RdRp template-switching in RNA viruses.",

    "abstract": "Rare monogenic disorders of the primary cilium, termed ciliopathies, are characterized by extreme presentations of otherwise-common diseases, such as diabetes, hepatic fibrosis, and kidney failure. However, despite a revolution in our understanding of the ciliums role in rare disease pathogenesis, the organelles contribution to common disease remains largely unknown. We hypothesized that common genetic variants affecting Mendelian ciliopathy genes might also contribute to common complex diseases pathogenesis more generally. To address this question, we performed association studies of 16,875 common genetic variants across 122 well-characterized ciliary genes with 12 quantitative laboratory traits characteristic of ciliopathy syndromes in 378,213 European-ancestry individuals in the UK BioBank. We incorporated tissue-specific gene expression analysis, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and Mendelian disease information into our analysis, and replicated findings in meta-analysis to increase our confidence in observed associations between ciliary genes and human phenotypes. 73 statistically-significant gene-trait associations were identified across 34 of the 122 ciliary genes that we examined (including 8 novel, replicating associations). With few exceptions, these ciliary genes were found to be widely expressed in human tissues relevant to the phenotypes being studied, and our eQTL analysis revealed strong evidence for correlation between ciliary gene expression levels and patient phenotypes. Perhaps most interestingly our analysis identified different ciliary subcompartments as being specifically associated with distinct sets of patient phenotypes, offering a number of testable hypotheses regarding the ciliums role in common complex disease. Taken together, our data demonstrate the utility of a Mendelian pathway-based approach to genomic association studies, and challenge the widely-held belief that the cilium is an organelle important mainly in development and in rare syndromic disease pathogenesis. The continued application of techniques similar to those described here to other phenotypes/Mendelian diseases is likely to yield many additional fascinating associations that will begin to integrate the fields of common and rare disease genetics, and provide insight into the pathophysiology of human diseases of immense public health burden.\n\nContacttheodore.drivas@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "Menopause is related to a decline in ovarian estrogen production, affecting the perception of the somatosensory stimulus, changing the immune-inflammatory systems, and triggering depressive symptoms. Inhibition of kinin B1 and B2 receptors (B1R and B2R) inhibits the depressive-like behavior and mechanical allodynia induced by immune-inflammatory mediators in mice. However, there is no evidence on the role of kinin receptors in depressive-like and nociceptive behavior in female mice submitted to bilateral ovariectomy. This study shows that ovariectomized mice (OVX) developed time-related mechanical allodynia and increased immobility time in the tail suspension test (TST). The genetic deletion of B1R, or the pharmacological blockade by selective kinin B1R antagonist R-715 (acute, i.p), reduced the increase of immobility time and mechanical allodynia induced by ovariectomy. Neither genetic deletion nor pharmacological inhibition of B2R (HOE 140, i.p) prevented the behavioral changes elicited by OVX. Our data suggested a particular modulation of kinin B1R in the nociceptive and depressive-like behavior in ovariectomized mice. Selective inhibition of the B1R receptor may be a new pharmacological target for treating pain and depression symptoms in women on the perimenopause/menopause period.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has given rise to a global pandemic. The gastrointestinal symptoms of some COVID-19 patients are underestimated. There is an urgent need to develop physiologically relevant model that can accurately reflect human response to viral infection. Here, we report the creation of a biomimetic human intestine infection model on a chip system that allows to recapitulate the intestinal injury and immune response induced by SARS-CoV-2, for the first time. The microengineered intestine-on-chip device contains human intestinal epithelium (co-cultured human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells and mucin secreting HT-29 cells) lined in upper channel and vascular endothelium (human umbilical vein endothelial cells, HUVECs) in a parallel lower channel under fluidic flow condition, sandwiched by a porous PDMS membrane coated with extracellular matrix (ECM). At day 3 post-infection of SARS-CoV-2, the intestine epithelium showed high susceptibility to viral infection and obvious morphological changes with destruction of intestinal villus, dispersed distribution of mucus secreting cells and reduced expression of tight junction (E-cadherin), indicating the destruction of mucous layer and the integrity of intestinal barrier caused by virus. Moreover, the endothelium exhibited abnormal cell morphology with disrupted expression of adherent junction protein (VE-cadherin). Transcriptional analysis revealed the abnormal RNA and protein metabolism, as well as activated immune responses in both epithelial and endothelial cells after viral infection (e.g., up-regulated cytokine genes, TNF signaling and NF-kappa B signaling-related genes). This bioengineered in vitro model system can mirror the human relevant pathophysiology and response to viral infection at the organ level, which is not possible in existing in vitro culture systems. It may provide a promising tool to accelerate our understanding of COVID-19 and devising novel therapies.",

    "abstract": "Space travel and prolonged bed rest are examples of mechanical unloading that induce significant muscle and bone loss. To explore interactions between skeletal bone and muscle during reloading, we hypothesized that acute external mechanical loading of bone in combination with re-ambulation facilitates proportional recovery of bone and muscle lost during hind limb suspension (HLS) unloading. Adult male C57Bl/6J mice were assigned to a HLS or time-matched ground control (GC) group. After 2-weeks of HLS, separate groups of mice were studied at day 14 (no re-ambulation), day 28 (14 days re-ambulation) and day 56 (42 days re-ambulation); throughout the re-ambulation period, one limb received mechanical loading and the contralateral limb served as an internal control. HLS induced loss of trabecular bone volume (BV/TV; -51%{+/-}2%) and muscle weight (-15%{+/-}2%) compared to GC at day 14. At day 28, the left tibia (re-ambulation only) of HLS mice had recovered 20% of BV/TV lost during HLS, while the right tibia (re-ambulation and acute external mechanical loading) recovered to GC values of BV/TV ([~]100% recovery). At day 56, the right tibia continued to recover bone for some outcomes (trabecular BV/TV, trabecular thickness), while the left limb did not. Cortical bone displayed a delayed response to HLS, with a 10% greater decrease in BV/TV at day 28 compared to day 14. In contrast to bone, acute external mechanical loading during the re-ambulation period did not significantly increase muscle mass or protein synthesis in the gastrocnemius, compared to re-ambulation alone.",

    "abstract": "An efficient in vivo transient transfection system using protoplasts is an important tool to study gene expression, metabolic pathways, and multiple mutagenesis parameters in plants. Although rice protoplasts can be isolated from germinated seedlings or cell suspension culture, preparation of those donor tissues can be inefficient, time consuming, and laborious. Additionally, the lengthy process of protoplast isolation and transfection needs to be completed in a single day. Here we report a protocol for isolation of protoplasts directly from rice calli, without using seedlings or suspension culture. The method is developed to employ discretionary pause points during protoplast isolation and prior to transfection. Protoplasts maintained within a sucrose cushion partway through isolation, for completion on a subsequent day, per the first pause point, are referred to as S protoplasts. Fully isolated protoplasts maintained in MMG solution for transfection on a subsequent day, per the second pause point, are referred to as M protoplasts. Both S and M protoplasts, 1 day after initiation of protoplast isolation, had minimal loss of viability and transfection efficiency compared to protoplasts 0 days after isolation. S protoplast viability decreases at a lower rate over time than that of M protoplasts and can be used with added flexibility for transient transfection assays and time-course experiments. The protoplasts produced by this method are competent for transfection of both plasmids and ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). Cas9 RNPs were used to demonstrate the utility of these protoplasts to assay genome editing in vivo. The current study describes a highly effective and accessible method to isolate protoplasts from callus tissue induced from rice seeds. This method utilizes donor materials that are resource-efficient and easy to propagate, permits convenience via pause points, and allows for flexible transfection days after protoplast isolation. It provides an advantageous and useful platform for a variety of in vivo transient transfection studies in rice.",

    "abstract": "Parallel independent component analysis (pICA) is a data-driven method that identifies the maximally independent components of multiple imaging modalities while simultaneously investigating the strength of their correlations. Researchers using pICA are given the option to use the suggested model order calculated by the minimum descriptive length (MDL) algorithm, or they can choose their own model order. To date, there are no suggested guidelines for this choice. To test the sensitivity of pICA to the selection of model order, we applied it to a well-researched brain disorder, schizophrenia, looking at the correlations between patterns of grey matter volume (GM) volume and white matter integrity, measured using fractional anisotropy (FA). We varied model orders from low to high, and tested the sensitivity to disorder effects (cases vs controls), similarity of spatial maps identified across model orders, consolidation or distribution effects related to model order selection, and the performance of the minimum descriptive length (MDL) algorithm. The pICA results (multimodal analysis) were also compared to the ICA (unimodal analysis) for each imaging modality. Across model orders, there was consistent sensitivity to disorder effects, and clustered patterns of spatial maps for both the GM and FA reflecting those differences. The MDL-estimated model order captured the majority, but not all, of the spatial patterns present in the GM and FA. There was not the expected consolidation of spatial maps at lower model orders, nor the distribution of spatial maps at higher model orders. The spatial patterns identified in the ICA closely resemble those found in the pICA, although lacking the benefit of the optimization algorithm, were not as highly correlated. This offers some insight and guidance for researchers interested in using pICA with regard to selecting model order for their particular analysis of multiple imaging modalities.",

    "abstract": "Change is ubiquitous in living beings. In particular, the connectome and neural representations can change. Nevertheless behaviors and memories often persist over long times. In a standard model, memories are represented by assemblies of strongly interconnected neurons. For faithful storage these assemblies are assumed to consist of the same neurons over time. Here we propose a contrasting memory model with complete temporal remodeling of assemblies, based on experimentally observed changes of connections and neural representations. The assemblies drift freely as spontaneous synaptic turnover or random activity induce neuron exchange. The gradual exchange allows activity dependent and homeostatic plasticity to conserve the representational structure and keep inputs, outputs and assemblies consistent. This leads to persistent memory. Our findings explain recent experimental results on the temporal evolution of fear memory representations and suggest that memory systems need to be understood in their completeness as individual parts may constantly change.",

    "abstract": "Sensory cue integration is one of the primary areas in which a normative mathematical framework has been used to define the \"optimal\" way in which to make decisions based upon ambiguous sensory information and compare these predictions to behaviour. The conclusion from such studies is that sensory cues are integrated in a statistically optimal fashion. However, numerous alternative computational frameworks exist by which sensory cues could be integrated, many of which could be described as \"optimal\" based on different criteria. Existing studies rarely assess the evidence relative to different candidate models, resulting in an inability to conclude that sensory cues are integrated according to the experimenters preferred framework. The aims of the present paper are to summarise and highlight the implicit assumptions rarely acknowledged in testing models of sensory cue integration, as well as to introduce an unbiased and principled method by which to determine, for a given experimental design, the probability with which a population of observers behaving in accordance with one model of sensory integration can be distinguished from the predictions of a set of alternative models.",

    "abstract": "Being able to accurately perceive the emotion expressed by the facial or verbal expression from others is critical to successful social interaction. However, only few studies examined the multimodal interactions on speech emotion, and there is no consistence in studies on the speech emotion perception. It remains unclear, how the speech emotion of different valence is perceived on the multimodal stimuli by our human brain. In this paper, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with an event-related design, using dynamic facial expressions and emotional speech stimuli to express different emotions, in order to explore the perception mechanism of speech emotion in audio-visual modality. The representational similarity analysis (RSA), whole-brain searchlight analysis, and conjunction analysis of emotion were used to interpret the representation of speech emotion in different aspects. Significantly, a weighted RSA approach was creatively proposed to evaluate the contribution of each candidate model to the best fitted model. The results of weighted RSA indicated that the fitted models were superior to all candidate models and the weights could be used to explain the representation of ROIs. The bilateral amygdala has been shown to be associated with the processing of both positive and negative emotions except neutral emotion. It is indicated that the left posterior insula and the left anterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) play important roles in the perception of multimodal speech emotion.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeThe presence of a paramagnetic rim around a white matter lesion has recently been shown to be a hallmark of a particular pathological type of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion. Increased prevalence of these paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) is associated with a more severe disease course in MS. The identification of these lesions is time-consuming to perform manually. We present a method to automatically detect PRLs on 3T T2*-phase images.\n\nMethodsT1-weighted, T2-FLAIR, and T2*-phase MRI of the brain were collected at 3T for 19 subjects with MS. The images were then processed with lesion segmentation, lesion center detection, lesion labelling, and lesion-level radiomic feature extraction. A total of 877 lesions were identified, 118 (13%) of which contained a paramagnetic rim. We divided our data into a training set (15 patients, 673 lesions) and a testing set (4 patients, 204 lesions). We fit a random forest classification model on the training set and assessed our ability to classify lesions as PRL on the test set.\n\nResultsThe number of PRLs per subject identified via our automated lesion labelling method was highly correlated with the gold standard count of PRLs per subject, r = 0.91 (95% CI [0.79, 0.97]). The classification algorithm using radiomic features can classify a lesion as PRL or not with an area under the curve of 0.80 (95% CI [0.67, 0.86]).\n\nConclusionThis study develops a fully automated technique for the detection of paramagnetic rim lesions using standard T1 and FLAIR sequences and a T2*phase sequence obtained on 3T MR images.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA fully automated method for both the identification and classification of paramagnetic rim lesions is proposed.\nC_LIO_LIRadiomic features in conjunction with machine learning algorithms can accurately classify paramagnetic rim lesions.\nC_LIO_LIChallenges for classification are largely driven by heterogeneity between lesions, including equivocal rim signatures and lesion location.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Seabird movements and diet during the non-breeding season are poorly studied, yet understanding these aspects of seabird ecology is extremely important to effectively conserve these protected species. Stable isotope analyses (SIA) provide a cost-effective solution to filling these knowledge gaps, yielding information on diet and foraging locations of animals. This study aimed to use SIA to investigate whether Common Guillemots (Uria aalge) from different age classes and locations in the UK had contrasting diets and foraging areas during the post-breeding moult (July-September). SIA of secondary feathers and a newly-developed North Sea isoscape were used to identify the likeliest foraging areas and diets of deceased guillemots recovered from beaches in eastern Scotland and mixed fisheries in Cornwall and the Celtic Sea. Overall, guillemots foraged widely in the western, eastern and southern North Sea, consuming a variety of clupeid, gadoid and invertebrate prey. There were negligible dietary differences between age classes and birds from different recovery locations. Juveniles showed a wider range in foraging areas, but both age classes foraged in similar parts of the North Sea. Guillemots recovered from Scotland may have foraged further north, only overlapping with guillemots recovered from the southwestern UK in the southern and eastern North Sea. Their winter recovery locations also implied that they exhibited different movement strategies during the non-breeding season, meriting further investigation. Conservation efforts should target foraging areas in the southern and eastern North Sea which are highly threatened by gillnet fishing, shipping traffic and oil infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "Prospective gains and losses modulate cognitive processing, but it is unresolved whether gains and losses can facilitate flexible learning in changing environments. The prospect of gains might enhance flexible learning through prioritized processing of reward-predicting stimuli but is unclear how far this learning benefit extends when task demands increase. Similarly, experiencing losses might facilitate learning when they trigger attentional re-orienting away from loss-inducing stimuli, but losses may also impair learning by reducing the precise encoding of loss-inducing stimuli. To clarify these divergent views, we tested how varying magnitudes of gains and losses affect the flexible learning of object values in environments that varied attentional load by increasing the number of interfering object features during learning. With this task design we found that larger prospective gains improved learning efficacy and learning speed, but only when attentional load was low. In contrast, expecting losses generally impaired learning efficacy and this impairment was larger at higher attentional load. These findings functionally dissociate the contributions of prospective gains and losses on flexible learning, suggesting they operate via separate control mechanisms. One process is triggered by experiencing loss and seems to disrupt the encoding of specific loss-inducing features which leads to less efficient exploration during learning. The second process is triggered by experiencing gains which enhances learning through a more efficient prioritizing of reward-predicting stimulus features as long as the interference of distracting information is limited. These results demonstrate strengths and limitations of motivational regulation of learning efficacy in multidimensional environments having variable attentional loads.\n\nSignificance statementIncreasing the prospective gains is assumed to enhance flexible learning, but there is no consensus on whether imposing losses enhances or impairs flexible learning. We show that anticipating loss of already attained assets generally reduced learning changes in the relevance of visual objects and that this learning impediment is more pronounced when learning demands higher attentional control of interference from distracting object features. Moreover, we show that increasing the prospective gains indeed facilitates learning, but only when the learning problem has intermediate or low attentional demands. These findings document that the beneficial effects of gains hit a limit when task demands increase, and that prospective losses reduce cognitive flexibility already at low task demands which is exacerbated when task demands increase. These findings provide novel insight into the strengths and limitations of gains and of losses to support flexible learning in multidimensional environments imposing variable attentional loads.",

This suggests adenoma sensitivity may be lower for screening colonoscopy than for follow-up to a known positive stool-based test. Previous CRC microsimulation models assume identical sensitivities between screening and follow-up colonoscopies after positive stool-tests. The Colorectal Cancer and Adenoma Incidence and Mortality Microsimulation Model (CRC-AIM) was used to explore the impact on screening outcomes when assuming different adenoma sensitivity between screening and combined follow-up/surveillance colonoscopies.\n\nMethodsModeled screening strategies included colonoscopy every 10 years, triennial multitarget stool DNA (mt-sDNA), or annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT) from 50-75 years. Outcomes were reported per 1,000 individuals without diagnosed CRC at age 40. Base-case adenoma sensitivity values were identical for screening and follow-up/surveillance colonoscopies. Ranges of adenoma sensitivity values for colonoscopy performance were developed using different slopes of odds ratio adjustments and were designated as small, medium, or large impact scenarios.\n\nResultsAs the differences in adenoma sensitivity for screening versus follow-up/surveillance colonoscopies became greater, life-years gained (LYG) and reductions in CRC-related incidence and mortality versus no screening increased for mt-sDNA and FIT and decreased for screening colonoscopy. The LYG relative to screening colonoscopy reached >90% with FIT in the base-case scenario and with mt-sDNA in a \"medium impact\" scenario.\n\nConclusionsAssuming identical adenoma sensitivities for screening and follow-up/surveillance colonoscopies underestimates the potential benefits of stool-based screening strategies.",

However, it remains largely unknown how visual information from higher visual cortical areas is translated into such a semantic representation of an individual person. Here, we show that some amygdala and hippocampal neurons are selective to multiple different unrelated face identities based on shared visual features. The encoded identities form clusters in the representation of a deep neural network trained to recognize faces. Contrary to prevailing views, these neurons thus represent an individuals face with a visual feature-based code rather than one based on association with known concepts. Feature neurons encoded faces regardless of their identity, race, gender, familiarity, or pixel-level visual features; and the region of feature space to which feature neurons are tuned predicted their response to new face stimuli. Our results reveal a new class of neurons that bridge the perception-driven representation of facial features in the higher visual cortex with mnemonic semantic representations in the MTL, which may form the basis for declarative memory.",

In many African countries, farmers improve agricultural productivity by applying synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to crops, but their continued use over the years has had serious environmental consequences including air and water pollution as well as loss of soil fertility. To reduce the overuse of synthetic amendments, we are developing inocula for crops that are based on indigenous soil microbes, especially those that enhance plant growth and improve agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner. We first isolated environmental DNA from soil samples collected from an agricultural region to study the composition of the soil microbiomes and then used Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), an important legume crop in Botswana and other legumes as \"trap\" plants using the collected soil to induce nitrogen-fixing nodule formation. We have identified drought-tolerant bacteria from Botswana soils that stimulate plant growth; many are species of Bacillus and Paenibacillus. In contrast, the cowpea nodule microbiomes from plants grown in these soils house mainly rhizobia particularly Bradyrhizobium, but also Methylobacterium spp. Hence, the nodule microbiome is much more limited in non-rhizobial diversity compared to the soil microbiome, but also contains a number of potential pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "A recent estimate suggests that one in five deaths globally are associated with sepsis1. To date, no targeted treatment is available for this syndrome, likely due to substantial patient heterogeneity2,3 and our lack of insight into sepsis immunopathology4.

We previously reported an expanded CD14+ monocyte state, MS1, in patients with bacterial sepsis or non-infectious critical illness, and validated its expansion in sepsis across thousands of patients using public transcriptomic data9. Despite its marked expansion in the circulation of bacterial sepsis patients, its relevance to viral sepsis and association with disease outcomes have not been examined. In addition, the ontogeny and function of this monocyte state remain poorly characterized. Using public transcriptomic data, we show that the expression of the MS1 program is associated with sepsis mortality and is up-regulated in monocytes from patients with severe COVID-19. We found that blood plasma from bacterial sepsis or COVID-19 patients with severe disease induces emergency myelopoiesis and expression of the MS1 program, which are dependent on the cytokines IL-6 and IL-10. Finally, we demonstrate that MS1 cells are broadly immunosuppressive, similar to monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and have decreased responsiveness to stimulation. Our findings highlight the utility of regulatory myeloid cells in sepsis prognosis, and the role of systemic cytokines in inducing emergency myelopoiesis during severe bacterial and SARS-CoV-2 infections.",

    "abstract": "A minor subset of individuals infected with HIV-1 develop antibody neutralization breadth during the natural course of the infection, often linked to chronic, high level viremia. Despite significant efforts, vaccination strategies have been unable to induce similar neutralization breadth and the mechanisms underlying neutralizing antibody induction remain largely elusive. Broadly neutralizing antibody responses can also be found in individuals who control HIV to low and even undetectable plasma levels in the absence of antiretroviral therapy, suggesting that high antigen exposure is not a strict requirement for neutralization breadth. We therefore performed an analysis of paired heavy and light chain B-cell receptor repertoires in 12,591 HIV-1 Envelope-specific single memory B-cells to determine alterations in the BCR immunoglobulin gene repertoire and B-cell clonal expansions that associate with neutralizing antibody breadth in 22 HIV controllers. We found that the frequency of genomic mutations in IGHV and IGLV was directly correlated with serum neutralization breadth. The repertoire of the most mutated antibodies was dominated by a small number of large clones with evolutionary signatures suggesting that these clones had reached peak affinity maturation. These data demonstrate that even in the setting of low plasma HIV antigenemia, similar to what a vaccine can potentially achieve, BCR selection for extended somatic hypermutation and clonal evolution can occur in some individuals suggesting that host-specific factors might be involved that could be targeted with future vaccine strategies.",

While many patients experience benefit from MRV therapy, pre-defined set points necessary for FDA approval have not been reached. Therefore, additional research into MRV biology and the effect of viral therapy on different tumor genetic subtypes and microenvironments is necessary to identify tumors most amenable to MRV virotherapy. In this work we analyzed the stage of viral infection necessary to inhibit HIF-1, an aggressive cancer activator induced by hypoxia. We ruled out a number of viral proteins and the virus genome as being necessary and determined that a step parallel with virus core movement across the endosomal membrane was required for this inhibition. Altogether, this work clarifies the mechanisms of MRV-induced HIF-1 inhibition and provides biological relevance for using MRV to inhibit the devastating effects of tumor hypoxia.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal nematodes (GINs) of humans, e.g., hookworms, negatively impact childhood growth, cognition, nutrition, educational attainment, income, productivity, and pregnancy. Hundreds of millions of people are targeted with mass drug administration (MDA) of donated benzimidazole (BZ) anthelmintics. However, BZ efficacy against GINs is suboptimal, and reduced/low efficacy has been seen. Developing an anthelmintic for human MDA is daunting: it must be safe, effective, inexpensive, stable without a cold chain, and massively scalable. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal protein 5B (Cry5B) has anthelmintic properties that could fill this void. Here we develop an API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) form of Bt Cry5B compatible with MDA. We expressed Cry5B in asporogenous Bt during vegetative phase, forming cytosolic crystals. These Bacteria with Cytosolic Crystals (BaCC) were rendered inviable (inactivated BaCC or IBaCC) with food-grade essential oils. IBaCC potency was validated in vitro against nematodes. IBaCC was also potent in vivo against human hookworm infections in hamsters. IBaCC production was successfully scaled to 350 liters at a contract manufacturing facility. A simple fit-for-purpose formulation to protect against stomach digestion and powdered IBaCC were successfully made and used against GINS in hamsters and mice. A pilot histopathology study and blood chemistry workup showed that five daily consecutive doses of 200 mg/kg Cry5B IBaCC (the curative single dose is 40 mg/kg) was non-toxic and completely safe. IBaCC is a safe, inexpensive, highly effective, easy-to-manufacture, and scalable anthelmintic that is practical for MDA and represents a new paradigm for treating human GINs.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory infections by RNA viruses are one of the major burdens upon global health and economy. Viruses like influenza or coronaviruses can be transmitted through respiratory droplets or contaminated surfaces. An effective antiviral coating can decrease the viability of the virus particles in the outside environment significantly, hence reducing their transmission rate. In this work, we have screened a series of nanoparticles and their composites for antiviral activity using Nano Luciferase based highly sensitive influenza A reporter virus. Using this screening system, we have identified copper-graphene (Cu-Gr) nanocomposite shows strong antiviral activity. Extensive material and biological characterization of the nanocomposite suggested a unique metal oxide embedded graphene sheet architecture that can inactivate the virion particles only within 30 minutes of pre-incubation and subsequently interferes with the entry of these virion particles into the host cell. This ultimately results in reduced viral gene expression, replication and production of progeny virus particles, slowing down the overall pace of progression of infection. Using PVA as a capping agent, we have been able to generate a Cu-Gr nanocomposite based highly transparent coating that retains its original antiviral activity in the solid form.",

    "abstract": "A novel, non-motile, Gram-stain-positive, non-spore-forming, obligate anaerobic bacterium, designated strain TF01-11T, was isolated from human faeces. The isolate was characterized by phylogenetic and phenotypic properties, as well as by determination of its whole genome sequence. The growth temperature and pH ranges were 30-42 {degrees}C and 6.0-8.5, respectively. The end products of glucose fermentation were butyric acid and a small amount of acetic acid. The genome was estimated to be 3.61Mbp with G+C content of 36.79 mol%. Genes related to biosynthesis of diaminopimelic acid, polar lipids, polyamines, teichoic and lipoteichoic acids were present. The predominant fatty acids were C16:0 (37.9 %), C14:0 (16.4 %), C13:0 OH/iso-C15:1 H (11.1 %) and C18:1{omega} 9c (10.6 %).

    "abstract": "Diverse bacterial pathogens employ effector delivery systems to disrupt vital cellular processes in the host (1). The type III secretion system 1 of the marine pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, utilizes the sequential action of four effectors to induce a rapid, pro-inflammatory cell death uniquely characterized by a pro-survival host transcriptional response (2, 3). Herein, we show that this pro-survival response is caused by the action of the channel-forming effector VopQ that targets the host V-ATPase resulting in lysosomal deacidification and inhibition of lysosome-autophagosome fusion. Recent structural studies have shown how VopQ interacts with the V-ATPase and, while in the ER, a V-ATPase assembly intermediate can interact with VopQ causing a disruption in membrane integrity. Additionally, we observe that VopQ-mediated disruption of the V-ATPase activates the IRE1 branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR) resulting in an IRE1-dependent activation of ERK1/2 MAPK signaling. We also find that this early VopQ-dependent induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation is terminated by the VopS-mediated inhibitory AMPylation of Rho GTPase signaling. Since VopS dampens VopQ-induced IRE1-dependent ERK1/2 activation, we propose that IRE1 activates ERK1/2 phosphorylation at or above the level of Rho GTPases. This study illustrates how temporally induced effectors can work as in tandem as agonist/antagonist to manipulate host signaling and reveal new connections between V-ATPase function, UPR and MAPK signaling.\n\nImportanceVibrio parahaemolyticus (V. para) is a seafood-borne pathogen that encodes two Type 3 Secretion Systems (T3SS). The first system T3SS1 is thought to be maintained in all strains of V. para to to maintain survival in the environment, whereas the second sytem T3SS2 is linked to clinical isolates and disease in humans. Herein, we find that first system targets evolutionarily conserved signaling systems to manipulate host cells, eventually causing a rapid, orchestrated cells death within three hours. We have found that the T3SS1 injects virulence factors that temporally manipulate host signaling. Within the first hour of infection, the effector VopQ acts first by activating host surval signals while diminishing the host cell apoptotic machinery. Less than an hour later, another effector VopS reverses activation and inhibition of these signaling systems ultimately leading to death of the host cell. This work provides example of how pathogens have evolved to manipulate the interplay between T3SS effectors to regulate host signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "In light of their adverse impacts on resident microbial communities, it is widely predicted that broad-spectrum antibiotics can promote the spread of resistance by releasing resistant strains from competition with other strains and species. We investigated the invasion success of a resistant strain of Escherichia coli inoculated into human-associated communities in the presence and absence of the broad and narrow spectrum antibiotics rifampicin and polymyxin B, respectively. We found strong evidence of community-level suppression of the resistant strain in the absence of antibiotics and, despite large changes in community composition and abundance following rifampicin exposure, suppression of the invading resistant strain was maintained in both antibiotic treatments. Instead, the strength of competitive suppression was more strongly associated with the individual donor from which the community was sampled. This suggests microbiome composition strongly influences susceptibility to invasion by antibiotic-resistant strains, but at least some antibiotic-associated disruption can be tolerated before invasion susceptibility increases. A deeper understanding of this association will aid the development of ecologically-aware strategies for managing antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "In most prokaryotes, missing and poorly active non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DNA repair pathways heavily restrict the direct application of CRISPR-Cas for DNA double-strand break (DSB)-based genome engineering without providing editing templates. CRISPR base editors, on the other hand, can be directly used for genome engineering in a number of bacteria, including E. coli, showing advantages over CRISPR-Cas9, since they do not require DSBs. However, as the current CRISPR base editors can only engineer DNA by A to G or C to T/G/A substitutions, they are incapable of mediating deletions, insertions, and combinations of deletions, insertions and substitutions. To address these challenges, we developed a Cas9 nickase (Cas9n)-reverse transcriptase (Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus, M-MLV) mediated, DSB-free, versatile, and single-nucleotide resolution genetic manipulation toolkit for prokaryotes, termed CRISPR-nRAGE (CRISPR-Cas9n Reverse transcriptase Assisted Genome Engineering) system. CRISPR-nRAGE can be used to introduce substitutions, deletions, insertions, and the combination thereof, both in plasmids and the chromosome of E. coli. Notably, small sized-deletion shows better editing efficiency compared to other kinds of DNA engineering. CRISPR-nRAGE has been used to delete and insert DNA fragments up to 97 bp and 33 bp, respectively. Efficiencies, however, drop sharply with the increase of the fragment size. It is not only a useful addition to the genome engineering arsenal for E. coli, but also may be the basis for the development of similar toolkits for other organisms.",

The ER membrane protein complex (EMC), comprising eight conserved subunits, has emerged as a central player in this process. Yet, we have limited understanding of how EMC enables insertion and integrity of diverse clients, from tail-anchored to polytopic transmembrane proteins. Here, yeast and human EMC cryo-EM structures reveal conserved intricate assemblies and human-specific features associated with pathologies. Structure-based functional studies revealed at least two separable EMC activities, as an insertase regulating tail-anchored protein levels and as a polytopic membrane protein holdase chaperone. These depend on mechanistically coupled yet spatially distinct regions including two lipid-accessible membrane cavities which confer client-specific regulation, and a novel, non-insertase EMC function mediated by the EMC lumenal domain. Our studies illuminate the structural and mechanistic basis of EMCs multifunctionality and point to its role in differentially regulating the biogenesis of distinct client protein classes.",

    "abstract": "Iodine is one of the oldest antimicrobial agents. Till now there have been no reports on acquiring resistance to iodine. Recent studies showed promising results on application of iodine-containing nano-micelles, FS-1, against antibiotic resistant pathogens as a supplement to antibiotic therapy. The mechanisms of the action, however, remain unclear. The aim of this study was to perform a holistic analysis and comparison of gene regulation in three phylogenetically distant multidrug resistant reference strains representing pathogens associated with nosocomial infections from the ATCC culture collection: Escherichia coli BAA-196, Staphylococcus aureus BAA-39 and Acinetobacter baumannii BAA-1790. These cultures were treated by a 5 min exposure to sublethal concentrations of the iodine-containing drug FS-1 applied in the late lagging and the mid of the logarithmic growth phases. Complete genome sequences of these strains were obtained in the previous studies. Gene regulation was studied by total RNA extraction and Ion Torrent sequencing followed by mapping the RNA reads against the reference genome sequences and statistical processing of read counts using the DESeq2 algorithm. It was found that the treatment of bacteria with FS-1 profoundly affected the expression of many genes involved in central metabolic pathways; however, alterations of the gene expression profiles were species-specific and depended on the growth phase. Disruption of respiratory electron-transfer membrane complexes, increased penetrability of bacterial cell walls, osmotic and oxidative stresses leading to DNA damaging were the major factors influencing the treated bacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCEInfections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria threaten the public health worldwide. Combinatorial therapy when antibiotics are administrated together with supplementary drugs improving susceptibility of pathogens to the regular antibiotics is considered as a promising way to overcome this problem. An induction of antibiotic resistance reversion by the iodine-containing nano-micelle drug FS-1 has been reported recently. This drug is currently under clinical trials in Kazakhstan against multidrug resistant tuberculosis. The effects of released iodine on metabolic and regulatory processes in bacterial cells remain unexplored. The current work provides an insight into gene regulation in the antibiotic resistant nosocomial reference strains treated with iodine-containing nanoparticles. This study sheds light on unexplored bioactivities of iodine and the mechanisms of its antibacterial effect when applied in sublethal concentrations. This knowledge will aid in the future design of new drugs against antibiotic resistant infections.",

Streptomyces, like all bacteria, are confronted with the constant threat of phage predation, which in turn shapes bacterial evolution. However, despite significant sequencing efforts recently, relatively few phages infecting Streptomyces have been characterized compared to other genera. Here, we present the isolation and characterization of five novel Streptomyces phages. All five phages belong to the Siphoviridae family, based on their morphology as determined by transmission electron microscopy. Genome sequencing revealed that four of them were temperate phages, while one had a lytic lifestyle. Moreover, one of the newly sequenced phages shows very little homology to already described phages, highlighting the still largely untapped viral diversity. Altogether, this study expands the number of characterized phages of Streptomyces and sheds light on phage evolution and phage-host dynamics in Streptomyces.",

    "abstract": "The search for microorganisms that degrade hydrocarbons is highly relevant because it enables the bioremediation of these substances cheaply and without dangerous by-products. In this work, we studied the microbial communities of an exploratory oil well, abandoned a century ago, located in the Cahuita National Park of Costa Rica. Cahuita well is characterized by a continuous efflux of methane and the presence of a mixture of hydrocarbons including C2-dibenzothiophene, phenanthrene or anthracene, fluoranthene pyrene, dibenzothiophene, tricyclic terpanes, pyrene, sesquiterpenes, sterane and n-alkanes. Based on the analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons, we detected a significant abundance of methylotrophic bacteria (Methylobacillus (6.3-26.0 % of total reads) and Methylococcus (4.1-30.6 %)) and the presence of common genera associated with hydrocarbon degradation, such as Comamonas (0.8-4.6 %), Hydrogenophaga (1.5-3.3 %) Rhodobacter (1.0-4.9 %) and Flavobacterium (1.1-6.5 %). We evidenced the presence of methane monooxygenase (MMO) activities, responsible for the first step in methane metabolism, by amplifying the pmo gene from environmental DNA. We also isolated a strain of Methylorubrum rhodesianum, which was capable of using methanol as its sole carbon source. This work represents a contribution to the understanding of the ecology of communities of microorganisms in environments with permanently high concentrations of methane and hydrocarbons, which also has biotechnological implications for the bioremediation of highly polluting petroleum components.",

    "abstract": "The Arctic is impacted by climate warming faster than any other oceanic region on Earth. Assessing the baseline of microbial communities in this rapidly changing ecosystem is vital for understanding the implications of ocean warming and sea ice retreat on ecosystem functioning. Using CARD-FISH and semi-automated counting, we quantified 14 ecologically relevant taxonomic groups of bacterioplankton (Bacteria and Archaea) from surface (0-30 m) down to deep waters (2500 m) in summerly ice-covered and ice-free regions of the Fram Strait, the main gateway for Atlantic inflow into the Arctic Ocean. Cell abundances of the bacterioplankton communities in surface waters varied from 105 cells mL-1 in ice-covered regions to 106 cells mL-1 in the ice-free regions, and were overall driven by variations in phytoplankton bloom conditions across the Strait. The bacterial classes Bacteroidia and Gammaproteobacteria showed several-fold higher cell abundances under late phytoplankton bloom conditions of the ice-free regions. Other taxonomic groups, such as the Rhodobacteraceae, revealed a distinct association of cell abundances with the surface Atlantic waters. With increasing depth (>500 m), the total cell abundances of the bacterioplankton communities decreased by up to two orders of magnitude, while largely unknown taxonomic groups (e.g., SAR324 and SAR202 clades) maintained constant cell abundances throughout the entire water column (ca. 103 cells mL-1). This suggests that these enigmatic groups may occupy a specific ecological niche in the entire water column. Our results provide the first quantitative spatial variations assessment of bacterioplankton in the summerly ice-covered and ice-free Arctic water column, and suggest that further shift towards ice-free Arctic summers with longer phytoplankton blooms can lead to major changes in the associated standing stock of the bacterioplankton communities.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome can contribute to variation in fitness-related traits of their hosts, and thus to host evolution. Hosts are therefore expected to be under selection to control their microbiome, for instance through controlling microbe transmission from parents to offspring. Current models have mostly focused on microbes that either increase or decrease fitness. In that case, host-level selection is relatively straightforward, favouring either complete or no inheritance. In natural systems, however, vertical transmission fidelity varies widely, and microbiome composition is often shaped by a combination of vertical and horizontal transmission modes. We propose that such mixed transmission could optimize host fitness under fluctuating environments. Using a general model, we illustrate that decreasing vertical transmission fidelity increases the amount of microbiome variation, and thus potentially phenotypic variation, across hosts. Whether or not this is advantageous depends on environmental conditions, how much the microbiome changes during host development, and the contribution of other factors to trait variation. We discuss how environmentally-dependent microbial effects can favor intermediate transmission, review examples from natural systems, and suggest research avenues to empirically test our predictions. Overall, we show that imperfect transmission may be adaptive by allowing individuals to ensure phenotypic variability in their offspring in contexts where varying environments mean that this strategy increases long-term fitness.",

    "abstract": "Environmental factors experienced during development can affect the physiology and behavior of offspring. Maternal glucocorticoids (GCs) may convert environmental cues experienced by the mother into a cue triggering adaptive developmental plasticity in offspring. In North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), females exhibit increases in GCs when conspecific density is elevated, and selection favors more aggressive and perhaps more active mothers under high density conditions. We experimentally elevated maternal GCs during gestation or early lactation to test the hypothesis that elevated maternal GCs cause shifts in offspring aggression and activity that may prepare them for high density conditions. When offspring were weaned, we measured two behavioral traits (activity and aggression) using a standardized behavioral assay. Because maternal GCs may influence offspring hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and HPA axis activity may in turn affect offspring behavior, we also measured the impact of our treatments on offspring HPA axis activity (adrenal reactivity and negative feedback) and the association between offspring HPA axis activity and behavior. Increased maternal GCs during lactation, but not gestation, only slightly elevated activity levels in offspring. Offspring aggression, adrenal reactivity, and negative feedback did not differ between GC-treated and control groups. Offspring with higher adrenal reactivity did exhibit lower aggression, but the relationship between adrenal reactivity and aggression was not affected by treatment with maternal GCs. These results suggest maternal GCs during gestation or early lactation alone may not be a sufficient cue to produce changes in behavioral and physiological stress responses in offspring in natural populations.\n\nSummary StatementWe found maternal glucocorticoid levels do not influence offspring personality or HPA axis dynamics in North American red squirrels. Regardless of maternal glucocorticoid treatment, more aggressive squirrels exhibited lower adrenal reactivity.",

    "abstract": "There is much debate about the existence and function of neural oscillatory entrainment mechanisms in the auditory system. The frequency-following response (FFR) is an index of neural periodicity encoding that can provide a vehicle to study entrainment in frequency ranges relevant to speech and music processing. Criteria for entrainment include the presence of post-stimulus oscillations and phase alignment between stimulus and endogenous activity. To test the hypothesis of entrainment, in experiment 1 we collected FFR data to a repeated syllable using magneto- (MEG) and electroencephalography in 20 healthy adults. We observed significant oscillatory activity after stimulus offset in auditory cortex and subcortical auditory nuclei, consistent with entrainment. In these structures the FFR fundamental frequency converged from a lower value over 100 ms to the stimulus frequency, consistent with phase alignment, and diverged to a lower value after offset, consistent with relaxation to a preferred frequency. In experiment 2, we tested how transitions between stimulus frequencies affected the MEG-FFR to a train of pure-tone pairs in 30 adults. We found that the FFR was affected by the frequency of the preceding tone for up to 40 ms at subcortical levels, and even longer durations at cortical levels. Our results suggest that oscillatory entrainment may be an integral part of periodic sound representation throughout the auditory neuraxis. The functional role of this mechanism is unknown, but it could serve as a fine-scale temporal predictor for frequency information, enhancing stability and reducing susceptibility to degradation that could be useful in real-life noisy environments.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian neocortex develops from a single layer of neuroepithelial cells to form a six-layer heterogeneous mosaic of differentiated neurons and glial cells. This process requires a complex choreography of temporally and spatially restricted transcription factors and epigenetic regulators. Even subtle disruptions in this regulation can alter the way the neocortex forms and functions, leading to a neurodevelopmental disorder. One epigenetic regulator that is essential for the precise development of the neocortex is CITED2 (CBP/p300 Interacting Transactivator with ED-rich termini). Cited2 is highly expressed by intermediate progenitor cells in the subventricular zone during the generation of the superficial layers of the neocortex. A forebrain-specific conditional knockout of Cited2 (cKO) exhibits reduced proliferation of intermediate progenitor cells embryonically, leading to reduced thickness of the superficial layers and a specific reduction in the somatosensory neocortical length postnatally. Further, the Cited2 cKO displays decreased corpus callosum volume and dysregulation of precise neuronal connectivity within the somatosensory cortex. Here, we explore the behavioral consequences resulting from this aberrant neocortical development. We demonstrate that Cited2 cKO mice display decreased maternal separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations as neonates, and an increase in the repetitive behavior of rearing and lack of habituation following repeated acoustic startle as adults. They do not display alterations in anxiety-like behavior, overall locomotor activity or social interactions. Together with the morphological, molecular, and connectivity disruptions, these results identify the Cited2 cKO neocortex as an ideal system to study mechanisms underlying neurodevelopmental and neuroanatomical disruptions with relevance to human neurodevelopmental disorders.",

We controlled the inter-subject variability of illusory/cross-modal perception parametrically, by introducing temporal lags in the incongruent auditory-visual articulations of speech sounds using the McGurk paradigm. The functional segregation-integration balance was captured using two alternative computational approaches. First, the module responsible for cross-modal binding of sesnory signals defined as the perceptual binding network (PBN) was identified using standardized parametric statistical approaches and their temporal correlations with all other brain areas were computed. With increasing illusory perception, the majority of the nodes of PBN showed decreased cooperation with the rest of the brain, reflecting high local segregation but reduced global integration. Second, using graph theoretic measures, the altered patterns of local segregation-global integration were cross-validated.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, a plethora of studies have linked cortical gamma oscillations ([~]30-100 Hz) to neuro-computational mechanisms. Their functional relevance, however, is still passionately debated. Here, we asked if endogenous gamma oscillations in the human brain can be entrained by a rhythmic photic drive >50 Hz. A noninvasive modulation of endogenous brain rhythms allows conclusions about their causal involvement in neurocognition. To this end, we systematically investigated oscillatory responses to a rapid sinusoidal flicker in the absence and presence of endogenous gamma oscillations using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in combination with a high-frequency projector. The photic drive produced a robust response over visual cortex to stimulation frequencies of up to 80 Hz. Strong, endogenous gamma oscillations were induced using moving grating stimuli as repeatedly done in previous research. When superimposing the flicker and the gratings, there was no evidence for phase or frequency entrainment of the endogenous gamma oscillations by the photic drive. Unexpectedly, we did not observe an amplification of the flicker response around participants individual gamma frequencies; rather, the magnitude of the response decreased monotonically with increasing frequency. Source reconstruction suggests that the flicker response and the gamma oscillations were produced by separate, coexistent generators in visual cortex. The presented findings challenge the notion that cortical gamma oscillations can be entrained by rhythmic visual stimulation. Instead, the mechanism generating endogenous gamma oscillations seems to be resilient to external perturbation.\n\nSignificance StatementWe aimed to investigate to what extent ongoing, high-frequency oscillations in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) in the human brain can be entrained by a visual flicker. Gamma oscillations have long been suggested to coordinate neuronal firing and enable inter-regional communication. Our results demonstrate that rhythmic visual stimulation cannot hijack the dynamics of ongoing gamma oscillations; rather, the flicker response and the endogenous gamma oscillations coexist in different visual areas. Therefore, while a visual flicker evokes a strong neuronal response even at high frequencies in the gamma-band, it does not entrain endogenous gamma oscillations in visual cortex. This has important implications for interpreting studies investigating the causal and neuroprotective effects of rhythmic sensory stimulation in the gamma band.",

    "abstract": "The unique fast spiking (FS) phenotype of cortical parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons depends on multiple subtypes of voltage-gated potassium channels (Kv). PV neurons selectively express Kcns3, the gene encoding Kv9.3 subunits, suggesting that Kcns3 expression is critical for the FS phenotype. KCNS3 expression is lower in PV neurons in schizophrenia, but the effects of this alteration are unclear, because Kv9.3 subunit function is poorly understood. We therefore assessed the role of Kv9.3 subunits in PV neuron function by combining gene expression analyses, computational modeling, and electrophysiology in acute slices from the cortex of Kcns3-deficient mice\n\nKcns3 mRNA levels were ~50% lower in cortical PV neurons from Kcns3-deficient relative to wildtype mice. While silent per se, Kv9.3 subunits are believed to amplify the Kv2.1 current in Kv2.1-Kv9.3 channel complexes. Hence, to assess the consequences of reducing Kv9.3 levels, we simulated the effects of decreasing the Kv2.1-mediated current in a computational model. The FS cell model with reduced Kv2.1 produced spike trains with irregular inter-spike intervals, or stuttering, and greater Na+ channel inactivation, possibly due to a smaller afterhyperpolarization. As in the computational model, PV basket cells (PVBCs) from Kcns3-deficient mice displayed spike trains with strong stuttering, which depressed PVBC firing, and smaller afterhyperpolarization. Moreover, Kcns3 deficiency impaired the recruitment of PVBCs by stimuli mimicking synaptic input during cortical UP states, which elicited bursts of spikes at gamma frequency. Our data suggest that Kv9.3 subunits are critical for PVBC physiology, and that KCNS3 deficiency in schizophrenia may impair the substrate of gamma oscillations.\n\nSignificance statementIn the neocortex, Kcns3, the gene encoding voltage-dependent potassium (Kv) channel subunits Kv9.3, is selectively expressed by parvalbumin-positive (PV) neurons. Moreover, KCNS3 expression is decreased in PV neurons in schizophrenia. Kv 9.3 subunits are believed to amplify the current mediated by Kv2.1 subunits, however Kv9.3 function has not been investigated in PV cells.\n\nHere, simulations in a computational model and electrophysiological experiments with Kcns3-deficient mice revealed that Kcns3 deficiency disrupts repetitive firing in cortical PV neurons, possibly enhancing Na+ channel inactivation, and particularly with stimuli eliciting firing at gamma frequency band (30-80Hz). Our results suggest that Kv9.3 subunits are essential for PV neuron electrophysiology and that KCNS3 deficiency likely contributes to PV neuron dysfunction and gamma oscillation impairments in schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Genes enriched for rare disruptive coding variants in schizophrenia overlap those in which disruptive mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), particularly autism spectrum disorders and intellectual disability. However, it is unclear whether this implicates the same specific variants, or even variants with the same functional effects on shared risk genes. Here, we show that de novo mutations in schizophrenia are generally of the same functional category as those that confer risk for NDDs, and that the specific de novo mutations in NDDs are enriched in schizophrenia. These findings indicate that, in part, NDDs and schizophrenia have shared molecular aetiology, and therefore likely overlapping pathophysiology. We also observe pleiotropic effects for variants known to be pathogenic for several syndromic developmental disorders, suggesting that schizophrenia should be included among the phenotypes associated with these mutations. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that at least some forms of schizophrenia lie within a continuum of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "Evasion from imminent threats and prey attack are opposite behavioral choices critical to survival. Curiously, the lateral periaqueductal gray (LPAG) has been implicated in driving both responses. The LPAG responds to social threats and prey hunting while also drives predatory attacks and active defense. However, the LPAG neural mechanisms mediating these behaviors remain poorly defined. Here, we investigate how the LPAG mediates the choices of predatory hunting and evasion from a social threat. Pharmacogenetic inhibition in Fos DD-Cre mice of neurons responsive specifically to insect predation (IP) or social defeat (SD) revealed that distinct neuronal populations in the LPAG drive the prey hunting and evasion from social threats. We show that the LPAG provides massive glutamatergic projection to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). Optogenetic inhibition of the LPAG-LHA pathway impaired IP but did not alter escape/attack ratio during SD. We also found that pharmacogenetic inhibition of LHAGABA neurons impaired IP, but did not change evasion during SD. The results suggest that the LPAG control over evasion to a social attack may be regarded as a stereotyped response depending probably on glutamatergic descending projections. On the other hand, the LPAG control over predatory behavior involves an ascending glutamatergic pathway to the LHA that likely influences LHAGABA neurons driving predatory attack and prey consumption. The LPAG-LHA path supposedly provides an emotional drive for prey hunting and, of relevance, may conceivably have more widespread control on the motivational drive to seek other appetitive rewards.",

    "abstract": "To identify robust and reproducible methods of cerebellar morphometry that can be used in future large-scale structural MRI studies, we investigated the replicability, repeatability, and longterm reproducibility of three fully-automated software tools: FreeSurfer, CERES, and ACAPULCO. Replicability was defined as computational replicability, determined by comparing two analyses of the same high-resolution MRI data set performed with identical analysis software and computer hardware. Repeatability was determined by comparing the analyses of two MRI scans of the same participant taken during two independent MRI sessions on the same day for the Kirby-21 study. Long-term reproducibility was assessed by analyzing two MRI scans of the same participant in the longitudinal OASIS-2 study. We determined percent difference, the image intraclass correlation coefficient, the coefficient of variation, and the intraclass correlation coefficient between two analyses. Our results show that CERES and ACAPULCO use stochastic algorithms that result in surprisingly high differences between identical analyses for ACAPULCO and small differences for CERES. Changes between two consecutive scans from the Kirby-21 study were less than {+/-}5% in most cases for FreeSurfer and CERES (i.e., demonstrating high repeatability). As expected, long-term reproducibility was lower than repeatability for all software tools. In summary, CERES is an accurate, as demonstrated before, and reproducible tool for fully-automated segmentation and parcellation of the cerebellum. We conclude with recommendations for the assessment of replicability, repeatability, and longterm reproducibility in future studies on cerebellar structure.",
