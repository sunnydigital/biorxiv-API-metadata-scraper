    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is the deadliest infectious disease worldwide. The design of new treatments for TB is hindered by the large number of candidate drugs, drug combinations, dosing choices, and complex pharmaco-kinetics/dynamics (PK/PD). Here we study the interplay of these factors in designing combination therapies by linking a machine-learning model, INDIGO-MTB, which predicts in vitro drug interactions using drug transcriptomics, with a multi-scale model of drug PK/PD and pathogen-immune interactions called GranSim. We calculate an in vivo drug interaction score (iDIS) from dynamics of drug diffusion, spatial distribution, and activity within lesions against various pathogen sub-populations. The iDIS of drug regimens evaluated against non-replicating bacteria significantly correlates with efficacy metrics from clinical trials. Our approach identifies mechanisms that can amplify synergistic or mitigate antagonistic drug interactions in vivo by modulating the relative distribution of drugs. Our mechanistic framework enables efficient evaluation of in vivo drug interactions and optimization of combination therapies.",

    "abstract": "Arboviruses cause the most devastating diseases in humans and animals worldwide. Several hundred arbovirus are transmitted by mosquitoes, sand flies or ticks and are responsible for more than million deaths annually. Development of a model system is essential to extrapolate the molecular events occurring during infection in the human and mosquito host. Virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA) combined with MALDI TOF/TOF MS revealed that Dengue-2 virus (DENV-2) exploits similar protein molecules in Drosophila melanogaster and Aedes aegypti for its infection. Furthermore, the virus susceptibility studies revealed that DENV-2 could propagate in D. melanogaster, and DENV-2 produced in fruit fly is equally infectious to D. melanogaster and Ae. aegypti. Additionally, real time PCR analysis revealed that RNAi coupled with JAK-STAT and Toll pathway constitutes an effector mechanism to control the DENV-2 infection in flies. These observations point out that D. melanogaster harbors all necessary machineries to support the growth of arboviruses. With the availability of well-established techniques for genetic and developmental manipulations, D. melanogaster, offers itself as the potential model system for the study of arbovirus-vector interactions.",

    "abstract": "FreeSurfer is among the most widely used suites of software for the study of cortical and subcortical brain anatomy. However, analysis using FreeSurfer can be time-consuming and it lacks support for the graphics processing units (GPUs) after the core development team stopped maintaining GPU-accelerated versions due to significant programming cost. As FreeSurfer is a large project with millions of source lines, in this work, we introduce and examine the use of a directive-based framework, OpenACC, in GPU acceleration of FreeSurfer, and we found the OpenACC-based approach significantly reduces programming costs. Moreover, because the overhead incurred by CPU-to-GPU data transfer is the major challenge in delivering GPU-based codes of high performance, we compare two schemes, copy- and-transfer and overlapped-fully-transfer, to reduce such data transfer overhead. Exper-imental results show that the target function we accelerated with overlapped-fully-transfer scheme ran 2.3 as fast as the original CPU-based function, and the GPU-accelerated program achieved an average speedup of 1.2 compared to the original CPU-based program. These results demonstrate the usefulness and potential of utilizing the proposed OpenACC-based approach to integrate GPU support for FreeSurfer which can be easily extended to other computationally expensive functions and modules of FreeSurfer to achieve further speedup.",

To harness the exciting potential of single cell data for the study of the mouse spinal cord, we have created a harmonized atlas of spinal cord transcriptomic cell types that unifies six independent and disparate studies into one common analysis. With the power of this large and diverse dataset, we reveal spinal cord cell type organization, validate a combinatorial set of markers for in-tissue spatial gene expression analysis, and optimize the computational classification of spinal cord cell types based on transcriptomic data.

Here, we used high-throughput smFISH to screen centrosomal protein-coding genes, and we describe 8 human mRNAs accumulating at centrosomes. These mRNAs localize at different stages during cell cycle with a remarkable choreography, indicating a finely regulated translational program at centrosomes. Interestingly, drug treatments and reporter analyses revealed a common translation-dependent localization mechanism requiring the nascent protein. Using ASPM and NUMA1 as models, single mRNA and polysome imaging revealed active movements of endogenous polysomes towards the centrosome at the onset of mitosis, when these mRNAs start localizing. ASPM polysomes associate with microtubules and localize by either motor-driven transport or microtubule pulling. Remarkably, the Drosophila orthologs of the human centrosomal mRNAs also localize to centrosomes and also require translation. These data identify a conserved family of centrosomal mRNAs that localize by active polysomes transport mediated by nascent proteins.",

Here we explored whether lipidomic remodeling of the adrenal gland could mediate altered adrenocortical steroidogenesis during obesity.\n\nMethodsLipidomic analysis was performed in adrenal glands using shotgun mass spectrometry (MS), and steroid profiling of sera by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) from lean and obese mice. Gene expression analysis was performed in adrenal glands and adrenocortical cell populations. The role of Fatty Acid Desaturase 2 (FADS2) and arachidonic acid on steroid hormone production was studied in primary adrenal gland cell cultures.\n\nResultsAdrenal glands of obese mice displayed a distinct lipidomic profile, encompassing longer and more unsaturated storage lipids and phospholipids compared to adrenal glands of lean mice. Arachidonoyl acyl chains were abundant in the adrenal gland phospholipidome and increased upon obesity. This was accompanied by increased Fads2 expression, the rate-limiting enzyme of arachidonic acid synthesis, and enhanced plasma adrenocortical hormone levels. Inhibition of FADS2 in primary adrenal gland cell cultures abolished steroidogenesis, which was restored by arachidonic acid supplementation.\n\nConclusionsOur data suggest that the FADS2 - arachidonic acid axis regulates adrenocortical hormone synthesis, while alterations in the content of arachidonoyl chains in the adrenal gland phopsholipidome could account for disturbed adrenocortical hormone production.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe adrenal gland lipidome is remodeled in obesity.\nC_LIO_LIArachidonoyl groups are abundant in the adrenal gland phospholipidome and increase in obesity.\nC_LIO_LIFADS2 is highly expressed in the adrenal gland and its expression is further increased in obesity.\nC_LIO_LIFADS2 inhibition blunts adrenocortical steroidogenesis in primary adrenal gland cell cultures, while arachidonic acid supplementation restores it.\nC_LI",

However, this method requires the acquisition of tilt series, and its time consuming throughput of acquiring tilt series severely slows determination of in situ structures. By treating the electron densities of non-target protein as non-Gaussian distributed noise, we developed a new target function that greatly improves the efficiency of the recognition of the target protein in a single cryo-EM image without acquiring tilt series. Moreover, we developed a sorting function that effectively eliminates the false positive detection, which not only improves the resolution during the subsequent structure refinement procedure but also allows using homolog proteins as models to recognize the target protein. Together, we developed an in situ single particle analysis (isSPA) method. Our isSPA method was successfully applied to solve structures of glycoproteins on the surface of a non-icosahedral virus and Rubisco inside the carboxysome. The cryo-EM data from both samples were collected within 24 hours, thus allowing fast and simple structural determination in situ.",

TRPML1, which is a lysosomal Ca2+ release channel upregulated in TNBC, promotes TNBC tumor growth. Here we show a novel crosstalk between lysosomes and mitochondria mediated by TRPML1 in TNBC. TRPML1 is required for the maintenance of mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis. TRPML1 knockdown inhibits TNBC mitochondrial respiration, glycolysis and ATP production, leading to reduced proliferation, promotion of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with enhanced global and mitochondrial ROS. Further, TRPML1 downregulation enhances the cytotoxic effect of Doxorubicin in TNBC cells. Our data reveal a hitherto unknown link between lysosomal TRPML1 channels and mitochondrial metabolism and suggest that TRPML1 inhibition in combination with established chemotherapies could be an effective strategy against TNBC tumors.",

    "abstract": "While sexual dimorphism in courtship and copulation behavior is common in the animal kingdom, sexual dimorphism in feeding behavior is rare. The Aedes aegypti mosquito provides an example of extreme sexual dimorphism in feeding, because only the females show strong attraction to humans, and bite them to obtain a blood-meal necessary to stimulate egg production1-8. The genetic basis of this complex, modular, and sexually dimorphic feeding behavior is unknown. The fruitless gene is sex-specifically spliced in the brain of multiple insect species including mosquitoes9-11 and encodes a BTB zinc-finger transcription factor that has been proposed to be a master regulator of male courtship and mating behavior across insects12-17. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 to mutate the fruitless gene in male mosquitoes. fruitless mutant males fail to mate, confirming the ancestral function of this gene in male sexual behavior. Remarkably, fruitless mutant males also gain strong attraction to a live human host, a behavior that wild-type males never display. Humans produce multiple sensory cues that attract mosquitoes and we show that fruitless specifically controls hostseeking in response to human odor. These results suggest that male mosquitoes possess the neural circuits required to host-seek and that removing fruitless reveals this latent behavior in males. Our results highlight an unexpected repurposing of a master regulator of male-specific sexual behavior to control one module of female-specific blood-feeding behavior in a deadly vector of infectious diseases.",

We show that Q22YU3, which we name Shulin, locks the ODA motor domains into a closed conformation and inhibits motor activity. Cryo-EM reveals how Shulin stabilizes this compact form of ODAs by binding to the dynein tails.

Endothelial cells (ECs) fine tune hemostasis via cAMP-mediated secretion of von Willebrand factor (vWF), which promote the process of clot formation. The exchange protein directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular cAMP receptor that plays a key role in stabilizing ECs and suppressing inflammation. To assess whether EPAC could regulate vWF release during inflammation, we utilized our EPAC1-null mouse model and revealed an increased secretion of vWF in endotoxemic mice in the absence of the EPAC1 gene. Pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 in vitro mimicked the EPAC1-/- phenotype. EPAC1 regulated TNF-triggered vWF secretion from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in a phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-dependent manner. Furthermore, EPAC1 activation reduced inflammation-triggered vWF release, both in vivo and in vitro. Our data delineate a novel regulatory role of EPAC1 in vWF secretion and shed light on potential development of new strategies to controlling thrombosis during inflammation.\n\nKey PointPI3K/eNOS pathway-mediated, inflammation-triggered vWF secretion is the target of the pharmacological manipulation of the cAMP-EPAC system.",

However, a drawback of current technology is that micropatterning efficiency can be variable between proteins, and that proteins may lose activity on the micropatterns. Here, we describe a general method to enable micropatterning of virtually any protein at high specificity and homogeneity while maintaining its activity. Our method is based on an anchor that micropatterns well, Fibrinogen, which we functionalized to bind to common purification tags. This enhances micropatterning on various substrates, facilitates multiplexed micropatterning, and dramatically improves the on-pattern activity of fragile proteins like molecular motors. Furthermore, it enhances the micropatterning of hard to micropattern cells. Last, this method enables subcellular micropatterning, whereby complex micropatterns simultaneously control cell shape and the distribution of transmembrane receptors within that cell.

The ratio of \"hydrophobic-hydrophilic\" and \"positive-negative charged\" residues at the inner LWI remains conserved throughout vertebrate evolution and play important role in regulating TRPV1 trafficking, localization and functions. Arg575 is an important residue as Arg575Asp mutant has reduced Capsaicin-sensitivity, surface expression, colocalization with lipid-raft markers, cell area, and increased cell lethality. This lethality is due to the disruption of the ratio between positive-negative charges there. Such lethality can be rescued by either using TRPV1-specfic inhibitor 5-IRTX or by restoring the positive-negative charge ratio at that position, i.e. by introducing Asp576Arg mutation in Arg575Asp backbone. We propose that Arg575Asp mutant confers TRPV1 in a \"constitutive-open-like\" condition.

The evolution and mutational events of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes are critical for controlling virulence, transmissibility, infectivity, severity of symptoms and mortality associated to this infectious disease. We collected and investigated 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from patients infected in France. Detailed genome cartography of all mutational events (SNPs, indels) was reported and correlated to clinical features of patients. A comparative analysis between our 309 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from French patients and the reference Wuhan coronavirus genome revealed 315 substitution mutations and six deletion events: ten were in 5/3 UTR, 178 were nonsynonymous, 126 were synonymous and one generated a stop codon. Six different deleted areas were also identified in nine viral variants. In particular, 30 substitution mutations (18 nonsynonymous) and one deletion ({Delta}21765-21770) concerned the spike S glycoprotein. An average of 7.8 mutational events (+/- 1.7 SD) and a median of 8 (range, 7-9) were reported per viral isolate. Comparative analyses and clustering of specific mutational signatures in 309 genomes disclose several divisions in groups and subgroups combining their geographical and phylogenetic origin. Clinical outcomes of the 309 COVID-19-infected patients were investigated according to the mutational signatures of viral variants. These findings highlight the genome dynamics of the coronavirus 2019-20 and shed light on the mutational landscape and evolution of this virus. Inclusion of the French cohort enabled us to identify 161 novel mutations never reported in SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected worldwide. These results support a global and continuing surveillance of the emerging variants of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila, female body size is approximately 30% larger than male body size due to an increased rate of larval growth. While the mechanisms that control this sex difference in body size remain incompletely understood, recent studies suggest that the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling pathway (IIS) plays a role in the sex-specific regulation of growth during development. In larvae, IIS activity differs between the sexes, and there is evidence of sex-specific regulation of IIS ligands. Yet, we lack knowledge of how changes to IIS activity impact growth in each sex, as the majority of studies on IIS and body size use single- or mixed-sex groups of larvae and/or adult flies. The goal of our current study was to clarify the requirement for IIS activity in each sex during the larval growth period. To achieve this goal we used established genetic approaches to enhance, or inhibit, IIS activity, and quantified body size in male and female larvae. Overall, genotypes that inhibited IIS activity caused a female-biased decrease in body size, whereas genotypes that augmented IIS activity caused a male-specific increase in body size. This data extends our current understanding of larval growth by showing that most changes to IIS pathway activity have sex-biased effects on body size, and highlights the importance of analyzing data by sex in larval growth studies.",

    "abstract": "Viral replication is dependent on interactions between viral polypeptides and host proteins. Identifying virus-host protein interactions can thus uncover unique opportunities for interfering with the virus life cycle via novel drug compounds or drug repurposing. Importantly, many viral-host protein interactions take place at intracellular membranes and poorly soluble organelles, which are difficult to profile using classical biochemical purification approaches. Applying proximity-dependent biotinylation (BioID) with the fast-acting miniTurbo enzyme to 27 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549), we detected 7810 proximity interactions (7382 of which are new for SARS-CoV-2) with 2242 host proteins (results available at covid19interactome.org). These results complement and dramatically expand upon recent affinity purification-based studies identifying stable host-virus protein complexes, and offer an unparalleled view of membrane-associated processes critical for viral production. Host cell organellar markers were also subjected to BioID in parallel, allowing us to propose modes of action for several viral proteins in the context of host proteome remodelling. In summary, our dataset identifies numerous high confidence proximity partners for SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins, and describes potential mechanisms for their effects on specific host cell functions.",

However, it is still unclear how the virus interferes with immune cell and metabolic functions in the human body. In this study, we investigated the immune response in acute or convalescent COVID19 patients. We characterized the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using flow cytometry and found that CD8+ T cells were significantly subsided in moderate COVID-19 and convalescent patients. Furthermore, characterization of CD8+ T cells suggested that patients with a mild and moderate course of the COVID-19 disease and convalescent patients have significantly diminished expression of both perforin and granzyme A in CD8+ T cells. Using 1H-NMR spectroscopy, we characterized the metabolic status of their autologous PBMCs. We found that fructose, lactate and taurine levels were elevated in infected (mild and moderate) patients compared with control and convalescent patients. Glucose, glutamate, formate and acetate levels were attenuated in COVID-19 (mild and moderate) patients. In summary, our report suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to disrupted CD8+ T cytotoxic functions and changes the overall metabolic functions of immune cells.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 created an unprecedented health crisis since there is no vaccine for this novel virus. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have become crucial for reducing morbidity and mortality. In this study, in vitro and in vivo safety and efficacy analyzes of lyophilized vaccine candidates inactivated by gamma-irradiation were performed. The candidate vaccines in this study were OZG-3861 version 1 (V1), an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus vaccine, and SK-01 version 1 (V1), a GM-CSF adjuvant added vaccine. The candidate vaccines were applied intradermally to BALB/c mice to assess toxicity and immunogenicity. Preliminary results in vaccinated mice are reported in this study. Especially, the vaccine models containing GM-CSF caused significant antibody production with neutralization capacity in absence of the antibody-dependent enhancement feature, when considered in terms of T and B cell responses. Another important finding was that the presence of adjuvant was more important in T cell in comparison with B cell response. Vaccinated mice showed T cell response upon restimulation with whole inactivated SARS-CoV-2 or peptide pool. This study shows that the vaccines are effective and leads us to start the challenge test to investigate the gamma-irradiated inactivated vaccine candidates for infective SARS-CoV-2 virus in humanized ACE2+ mice.",

    "abstract": "A severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has recently caused a pandemic COVID-19 disease that infected more than 25.6 million and killed 852,000 people worldwide. Like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also employs a receptor-binding motif (RBM) of its envelope spike protein for binding the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to gain viral entry. Currently, extensive efforts are being made to produce vaccines against a surface fragment of a SARS-CoV-2, such as the spike protein, in order to boost protective antibody responses. It was previously unknown how spike protein-targeting antibodies would affect innate inflammatory responses to SARS-CoV-2 infections. Here we generated a highly purified recombinant protein corresponding to the RBM of SARS-CoV-2, and used it to screen for cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We found two RBM-binding mAbs that competitively inhibited its interaction with human ACE2, and specifically blocked the RBM-induced GM-CSF secretion in both human monocyte and murine macrophage cultures. Our findings have suggested a possible strategy to prevent SARS-CoV-2-elicited \"cytokine storm\", and provided a potentially useful criteria for future assessment of innate immune-modulating properties of various SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryRBM-binding Antibodies Inhibit GM-CSF Induction.",

    "abstract": "Sustained attention has long been thought to benefit perception in a continuous fashion, but recent evidence suggests that it affects perception in a discrete, rhythmic way. Periodic fluctuations in behavioral performance over time, and modulations of behavioral performance by the phase of spontaneous oscillatory brain activity point to an attentional sampling rate in the theta or alpha frequency range. We investigated whether such discrete sampling by attention is reflected in periodic fluctuations in the decodability of visual stimulus orientation from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) brain signals.\n\nIn this exploratory study, human subjects attended one of two grating stimuli while MEG was being recorded. We assessed the strength of the visual representation of the attended stimulus using a support vector machine (SVM) to decode the orientation of the grating (clockwise vs. counterclockwise) from the MEG signal. We tested whether decoder performance depended on the theta/alpha phase of local brain activity. While the phase of ongoing activity in visual cortex did not modulate decoding performance, theta/alpha phase of activity in the FEF and parietal cortex, contralateral to the attended stimulus did modulate decoding performance. These findings suggest that phasic modulations of visual stimulus representations in the brain are caused by frequency- specific top-down activity in the fronto-parietal attention network.",

    "abstract": "Previous research suggests that there is an interaction between cognitive and motor processes. This has been investigated throughout development and in different conditions related to motor impairment. The current study addressed a gap in the literature by investigating this interaction in the general population of healthy adults with different profiles of motor proficiency by focusing on error-related cognitive control and behavioural adaptation mechanisms. In addition, the impact of these processes was assessed in terms of experienced anxiety. Forty healthy adults were divided into high and low motor proficiency groups based on an assessment of their motor skills. Using electroencephalography (EEG) during a flanker task, error-related negativity (ERN) was measured as the neural indicator of cognitive control. Post-error slowing (PES) was measured to represent behavioural adaptation. Participants also completed an anxiety assessment questionnaire. Participants in the high motor proficiency group achieved better task accuracy and showed relatively enhanced cognitive control through increased ERN. Contrastingly, individuals in the lower motor proficiency group achieved poorer accuracy whilst showing some evidence of compensation through increased PES. Anxiety was found to be associated with motor functioning, but the study could not provide evidence that this was related to cognitive or behavioural control mechanisms. The interaction between cognitive and motor processes observed in this study is unique for healthy and sub-clinical populations and provides a baseline for the interpretation of similar investigations in individuals with motor disorders.",

While the indispensable function of FruM in sex-specific behavior has been understood for decades, the molecular mechanisms underlying its activity remain unknown. Here, we take a genome-wide, brain-wide approach to identifying regulatory elements whose activity depends on the presence of FruM. We identify 436 high-confidence genomic regions differentially accessible in male fruitless neurons, validate candidate regions as bona-fide, differentially regulated enhancers, and describe the particular cell types in which these enhancers are active. We find that individual enhancers are not activated universally but are dedicated to specific fru+ cell types. Aside from fru itself, genes are not dedicated to or common across the fru circuit; rather, FruM appears to masculinize each cell type differently, by tweaking expression of the same effector genes used in other circuits. Finally, we find FruM motifs enriched among regulatory elements that are open in the female but closed in the male. Together, these results suggest that FruM acts cell-type-specifically to decommission regulatory elements in male fruitless neurons.",

    "abstract": "Activation and modulation of sensory-guided behaviors by biogenic amines assure appropriate adaptations to changes in an insects environment. Given its genetic tool kit Drosophila melanogaster represents an excellent model organism to study larger networks of neurons by optophysiological methods. Here, we studied stationary crawling movements of 3rd instar larvae and revealed how the octopaminergic VUM neuron system reacts during crawling behavior and tactile stimulations. We conducted calcium imaging experiments on dissections of the isolated nervous system (missing all sensory input) and found spontaneous rhythmic wave pattern of neuronal activity in VUM neuron clusters over the range of thoracic and abdominal neuromeres in the VNC. In contrast, in vivo preparations (semi-intact animals, receiving sensory input) did not reveal such spontaneous rhythmic pattern. However, tactile stimulations activated different clusters of the VUM neuron system simultaneously in these preparations. The activation intensity of VUM neurons in the VNC was correlated with the location and degree of body wall stimulation. While VUM neuron cluster near the respective location of body wall stimulation were less activated more distant cluster showed stronger activation. Repeated gentle touch stimulations led to decreased response intensities, repeated harsh stimulations resulted in increasing intensities over trials. Optophysiological signals correlated highly with crawling behavior in freely moving larvae stimulated similarly. We conclude that the octopaminergic system is strongly coupled to the neuronal pattern generator of crawling movements and that it is simultaneously activated by physical stimulation, rather intensity than sequential coded. We hope that our work raises the interest in whole biogenic network activity and shows that octopamine release does not only underlie \"the more the better\" principle but instead has a more complex function in control and modulation of insects locomotion.",

Immunosuppression can lead to BKPyV reactivation in the first year post-transplantation in kidney (KTR) and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. In KTR, persistent DNAemia has been correlated to the occurrence of polyomavirus-associated nephropathy (PVAN) that can lead to graft loss if not properly controlled. Based on recent observations that conventional dendritic cells (cDC) specifically infiltrate PVAN lesions, we hypothesized that those cells could play a role in BKPyV infection. We first demonstrated that monocyte-derived DC (MDDC), an in vitro model for mDC, captured BKPyV particles through an unconventional GRAF-1 endocytic pathway. Neither BKPyV particles nor BKPyV-infected cells were shown to activate MDDC. Endocytosed virions were efficiently transmitted to permissive cells and shown to be protected from the antibody-mediated neutralization. Finally, we demonstrated that freshly isolated CD1c+ mDC from the blood and kidney parenchyma behaved similarly to MDDC thus extending our results to cells of clinical relevance. This study sheds light on a potential unprecedented CD1c+ mDC involvement in the BKPyV infection as a promoter of viral spreading.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) represent an abundant and conserved entity of non-coding RNAs, however the principles of biogenesis are currently not fully understood. To elucidate features important for circRNA production, we performed global analyses of RNA-binding proteins associating with the flanking introns of circRNAs, and we identified two factors, SFPQ and NONO, to be highly enriched with circRNAs. Using transient knockdown of both proteins in two human cell lines followed by total RNAseq, we found a subclass of circRNAs with distal inverted Alu elements and long introns to be highly deregulated upon SFPQ knockdown. In addition, SFPQ depletion leads to increased intron retention with concomitant induction of cryptic splicing prevalent for long introns causing in some cases premature transcription termination and polyadenylation. While SFPQ depletion has an overall negative effect on circRNA production, premature termination is not the main causative explanation. Instead, data suggests that aberrant splicing in the upstream and downstream regions of circRNA producing exons are critical for shaping the circRNAome, and specifically, we observe a conserved impact of missplicing in the immediate upstream region to drive circRNA biogenesis. Collectively, our data show that SFPQ plays an important role in maintaining intron integrity by ensuring accurate splicing of long introns, and disclose novel features governing Alu-independent circRNA production.",

    "abstract": "Receptor binding studies using recombinant SARS-CoV proteins have been hampered due to challenges in approaches creating spike protein or domains thereof, that recapitulate receptor binding properties of native viruses. We hypothesized that trimeric RBD proteins would be suitable candidates to study receptor binding properties of SARS-CoV-1 and -2. Here we created monomeric and trimeric fluorescent RBD proteins, derived from adherent HEK293T, as well as in GnTI mutant cells, to analyze the effect of complex vs high mannose glycosylation on receptor binding. The results demonstrate that trimeric fully glycosylated proteins are superior in receptor binding compared to monomeric and immaturely glycosylated variants. Although differences in binding to commonly used cell lines were minimal between the different RBD preparations, substantial differences were observed when respiratory tissues of experimental animals were stained. The RBD trimers demonstrated distinct ACE2 expression profiles in bronchiolar ducts and confirmed the higher binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 over SARS-CoV-1. Our results show that fully glycosylated trimeric RBD proteins are attractive to analyze receptor binding and explore ACE2 expression profiles in tissues.",

    "abstract": "Species with large local abundances tend to occupy more sites. One of the mechanisms proposed to explain this widely reported inter-specific relationship is a cross-scale hypothesis based on dynamics at the population level. Called the vital rates mechanism, it uses within-population demographic processes of population growth and density dependence to predict when inter-specific abundance-occupancy relationships can arise and when these relationships can weaken and even turn negative. Even though the vital rates mechanism is mathematically simple, its predictions has never been tested directly because of the difficulty estimating the demographic parameters involved. Here, using a recently introduced mark-recapture analysis method, we show that there is a weakly positive relationship between abundance and occupancy among 17 bird species. Our results are consistent with the predictions of the vital rate mechanism regarding the demographic processes that are expected to weaken this relationship. Specifically, we find that intrinsic growth rate and local abundance are weakly correlated; and density dependence strength shows considerable variation across species. Variability in density dependence strength is related to variability in species-level local average abundance and intrinsic growth rate; species with lower growth rate have higher abundance and are strongly regulated by density dependent processes, especially acting on survival rates. Species with higher growth rate, on average, have lower abundance and are more weakly regulated by density dependent processes especially acting on fecundity. More generally, our findings support a cross scale mechanism of macroecological abundance-occupancy relationship emerging from density-dependent dynamics at the population level.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are the most numerous biological entity, existing in all environments and infecting all cellular organisms. Compared with cellular life, the evolution and origin of viruses are poorly understood; viruses are enormously diverse and most lack sequence similarity to cellular genes. To uncover viral sequences without relying on either reference viral sequences from databases or marker genes known to characterize specific viral taxa, we developed an analysis pipeline for virus inference based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). CRISPR is a prokaryotic nucleic acid restriction system that stores memory of previous exposure. Our protocol can infer viral sequences targeted by CRISPR and predict their hosts using unassembled short-read metagenomic sequencing data. Analysing human gut metagenomic data, we extracted 11,391 terminally redundant CRISPR-targeted sequences which are likely complete circular genomes of viruses or plasmids. The sequences include 257 complete crAssphage family genomes, 11 genomes larger than 200 kilobases, 766 genomes of Microviridae species, 114 genomes of Inoviridae species and many entirely novel genomes of unknown taxa. We predicted the host(s) of approximately 70% of discovered genomes by linking protospacers to taxonomically assigned CRISPR direct repeats. These results support that our protocol is efficient for de novo inference of viral genomes and host prediction. In addition, we investigated the origin of the diversity-generating retroelement (DGR) locus of the crAssphage family. Phylogenetic analysis and gene locus comparisons indicate that DGR is orthologous in human gut crAssphages and shares a common ancestor with baboon-derived crAssphage; however, the locus has likely been lost in multiple lineages recently.",

    "abstract": "Moths of the family Tortricidae (Insecta: Lepidoptera) usually distribute in temperate and tropical high upland regions. The oriental fruit moth (OFM) Grapholita molesta is a globally important pest of stone and pome fruit from this family. In this study, we assembled a chromosome-level genome for the OFM and conducted a comparative genomic analysis with other lepidopterans. This genome was assembled to 28 chromosomes with a size of 517.71 Mb, an N50 of 19.5 Mb, and a BUSCO completeness of 97.1%. In total, 19968 protein-coding genes were predicted, among which 15269 were functionally annotated. We manually annotated ten gene families for 13 representative genomes from the Lepidopteran. In general, two tortricid moths have a moderate number of detoxification and receptor genes and the lowest number of HSP genes, congruent with their polyphagous dietary and pattern of distribution. However, the OFM has the highest number of P450, I Rs and ORs among all species. Compared to the other tortricid species of the codling moth Cydia pomonella, the OFM has more genes in all gene families. Our results indicate that the high number of some detoxification and receptor genes may be related to the strong adaptation of OFM as a global pest. The high-quality genome of OFM provides an invaluable resource for understanding the ecology, genetics, and evolution of tortricid moths.",

Here, we carried out a systematic and quantitative investigation of yeast ageing with single-cell resolution through transcriptomic sequencing. We optimized a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) protocol to quantitatively study the whole transcriptome profiles of single yeast cells at different ages, finding increased cell-to-cell transcriptional variability during ageing. The single-cell transcriptome analysis also highlighted key biological processes or cellular components, including oxidation-reduction process, oxidative stress response (OSR), translation, ribosome biogenesis and mitochondrion that underlie ageing in yeast. Remarkably, we uncovered a molecular marker, FIT3, that was linked to mitochondrial DNA loss and indicated the early heterogeneity during ageing in yeast. We also analyzed the regulation of transcription factors and further characterized the distinctive temporal regulation of the OSR by YAP1 and proteasome activity by RPN4 during ageing in yeast. Overall, our data profoundly reveal early heterogeneity during ageing in yeast and shed light on the ageing dynamics at the single cell level.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia trachomatis is the most prevalent cause of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) worldwide. U.S. cases have been steadily increasing for more than a decade in both the urogenital tract and rectum. C. trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that is not easily cultured, limiting the capacity for genome studies to understand strain diversity and emergence among various patient populations globally. While Agilent SureSelectXT target-enrichment RNA bait libraries have been developed for whole-genome enrichment and sequencing of C. trachomatis directly from clinical urine, vaginal, conjunctival and rectal samples, efficiencies are only 60-80% for [&ge;]95-100% genome coverage. We therefore re-designed and expanded the RNA bait library to augment enrichment of the organism from clinical samples to improve efficiency. We describe the expanded library, the limit of detection for C. trachomatis genome copy input, and the 100% efficiency and high-resolution of generated genomes where genomic recombination among paired vaginal and rectal specimens from four patients was identified. This workflow provides a robust approach for discerning genomic diversity and advancing our understanding of the molecular epidemiology of contemporary C. trachomatis STIs across sample types, among geographic populations, sexual networks, and outbreaks associated with proctitis/proctocolitis among women and men who have sex with men.\n\nImportanceChlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular bacterium that is not easily cultured, and there is limited information on rectal C. trachomatis transmission and its impact on morbidity. To improve efficiency of previous studies involving whole genome target enrichment and sequencing of C. trachomatis directly from clinical urine, vaginal, conjunctival, and rectal specimens, we expanded the RNA bait library to augment enrichment of the organism from clinical samples. We demonstrate an increased efficiency in the percentage of reads mapping to C. trachomatis. We show the new system is sensitive for near identical genomes of C. trachomatis from two body sites in four women. Further, we provide a robust genomic epidemiologic approach to advance our understanding of C. trachomatis strains causing ocular, urogenital and rectal infections, and to explore geo-sexual networks, outbreaks of colorectal infections among women and men who have sex with men, and the role of these strains in morbidity.",

    "abstract": "Environmental gradients between marine biogeographical provinces separate distinct faunal communities; in the absence of absolute dispersal barriers numerous species nonetheless occur on either side of such boundaries. While the regional populations of such widespread species tend to be morphologically indistinguishable from each other, genetic evidence suggests that they represent unique ecotypes, and likely even cryptic species, that may be uniquely adapted to their local environment. Here, we explored genomic divergence in four sympatric southern African decapod crustaceans whose ranges span the boundary between the cool-temperate west coast (south-eastern Atlantic) and the warm-temperate south coast (south-western Indian Ocean) near the southern tip of the African continent. Using genome-wide data, we found that all four species comprise distinct west- and south coast ecotypes, with molecular dating suggesting divergence during the Pleistocene. Using transcriptomic data from one of the decapod crustaceans, we further found a clear difference in gene expression profiles between the west- and south coast ecotypes. This was particularly clear in the individual from the south coast, which experienced a  transcriptomic shock at low temperatures that are more typical of the west coast and may explain their absence from that coastline. Our results shed new light on the processes involved in driving genomic divergence and incipient speciation.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has become the primary method for non-invasively studying the organization of white matter in the human brain. While many dMRI acquisition sequences have been developed, they all sample q-space in order to characterize water diffusion. Numerous software platforms have been developed for processing dMRI data, but most work on only a subset of sampling schemes or implement only parts of the processing workflow. Reproducible research and comparisons across dMRI methods are hindered by incompatible software, diverse file formats, and inconsistent naming conventions. Here we introduce QSIPrep, an integrative software platform for the processing of diffusion images that is compatible with nearly all dMRI sampling schemes. Drawing upon a diverse set of software suites to capitalize upon their complementary strengths, QSIPrep automatically applies best practices for dMRI preprocessing, including denoising, distortion correction, head motion correction, coregistration, and spatial normalization. Throughout, QSIPrep provides both visual and quantitative measures of data quality as well as \"glass-box\" methods reporting. Taken together, these features facilitate easy implementation of best practices for processing of diffusion images while simultaneously ensuring reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Mice are the most widely used animal model to study genotype to phenotype relationships. Inbred mice are genetically identical, which eliminates genetic heterogeneity and makes them particularly useful for genetic studies. Many different strains have been bred over decades and a vast amount of phenotypic data has been generated. In addition, recently whole genome sequencing-based genome-wide genotype data for many widely used inbred strains has been released. Here, we present an approach for in silico fine-mapping that uses genotypic data of 37 inbred mouse strains together with phenotypic data provided by the user to propose candidate variants and genes for the phenotype under study. Public genome-wide genotype data covering more than 74 million variant sites is queried efficiently in real-time to provide those variants that are compatible with the observed phenotype differences between strains. Variants can be filtered by molecular consequences and by corresponding molecular impact. Candidate gene lists can be generated from variant lists on the fly. Fine-mapping together with annotation or filtering of results is provided in a Bioconductor package called MouseFM. In order to characterize candidate variant lists under various settings, MouseFM was applied to two expression data sets across 20 inbred mouse strains, one from neutrophils and one from CD4+ T cells. Fine-mapping was assessed for about 10,000 genes, respectively, and identified candidate variants and haplotypes for many expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) reported previously based on these data. For albinism, MouseFM reports only one variant allele of moderate or high molecular impact that only albino mice share: a missense variant in the Tyr gene, reported previously to be causal for this phenotype. Performing in silico fine-mapping for interfrontal bone formation in mice using four strains with and five strains without interfrontal bone results in 12 genes. Of these, three are related to skull shaping abnormality. Finally performing fine-mapping for dystrophic cardiac calcification by comparing 9 strains showing the phenotype with 8 strains lacking it, we identify only one moderate impact variant in the known causal gene Abcc6. In summary, this illustrates the benefit of using MouseFM for candidate variant and gene identification.",

    "abstract": "4-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2-deoxyadenosine (EFdA, MK-8591, islatravir) is a nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor (NRTTI) with exceptional potency against WT and drug-resistant HIV strains. However, HIV resistance to EFdA is not well characterized. We therefore developed resistance to EFdA by serial passages using progressively increasing concentrations of EFdA. The starting virus was either WT or clinically relevant NRTI-resistant viruses K65R, M184V, and D67N/K70R/T215F/K219Q). In all cases, the selected mutations included M184V. Additional mutations in the RT connection domain (R358K and E399K) and one mutation in the RNase H domain (A502V) were noted. Site-specific mutagenesis validated the role for M184V as the primary determinant for resistance to EFdA; none of the connection domain mutations contributed significantly to phenotypic resistance to EFdA. A novel EFdA resistance mutation was also observed in the background of M184V. The A114S/M184V combination of mutations imparted higher resistance to EFdA (~24-fold) than M184V (-8-fold) or A114S (~2-fold) alone. Virus fitness data suggested that A114S affects HIV fitness by itself and in the presence of M184V. This is consistent with biochemical experiments that showed decreases in the enzymatic efficiency (kcat/Km) of WT RT vs. A114S (2.1-fold) and A114S/M184V/502V (6.5-fold), whereas there was no significant effect of A502V on RT or virus fitness. The observed EFdA resistance of M184V by itself and in combination with A114S combined with the strong published in vitro and in vivo data, confirm that EFdA is an excellent candidate as a potential HIV therapeutic.",

These sense organs have characteristic shapes related to their function, and in many cases are distributed in a fixed pattern so that they are identifiable individually. In Drosophila melanogaster, the identity of sense organs is regulated by specific combinations of transcription factors. In other arthropods, however, sense organ subtypes cannot be linked to the same code of gene expression. This raises the questions of how sense organ diversity has evolved in arthropods, and if the D. melanogaster subtype identity principle is representative for insects. To address these questions, we analyse sense organ development in another insect, the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. We show that in contrast to D. melanogaster, T. castaneum sense organs cannot be categorised based on their requirement for individual or combinations of the conserved sense organ transcription factors such as cut and pox-neuro and members of the Achaete-Scute (Tc ASH, Tc asense) and Atonal family (Tc atonal, Tc cato, Tc amos). Rather, these genes are required for the specification of sense organ precursors and the development and differentiation of sensory cell types in diverse external sensilla. Based on our findings and past research, we present an evolutionary scenario suggesting that sensory organs have diversified from a default state through subsequent recruitment of sensory genes to the different sense organ specification processes. A specific role for genes in subtype identity has evolved as a secondary effect of the function of these genes in individual or subsets of sense organs, which can largely not be aligned with morphological or functional categories.",

    "abstract": "Sponges live in symbioses with microbes that allow the hosts to exploit otherwise inaccessible resources. Given the potential of microbiomes to unlock new niche axes for the hosts, microbiomes may facilitate evolutionary innovation in the ecology of sponges. However, the hypothesis that ecological diversification evolves via the microbiome among multiple, closely related sponge species living in sympatry is yet untested. Here, we provide the first test of this hypothesis within Ircinia, a genus possessing diverse and abundant microbiomes that engage their hosts in nutritional symbioses. We used genome-wide SNP data (2bRAD) to delimit genetic species boundaries using BFD* among four Ircinia growth forms that putatively constitute distinct species and two nominal species, I. campana and I. strobilina. We also evaluated the performance of two single-locus genetic barcodes, CO1 and ITS, in resolving Ircinia species boundaries. We then used 16S rRNA metabarcoding to test whether the genetic species units uncovered by BFD* harbor microbiomes that are compositionally unique within each host lineage and distinct relative to seawater microbial communities. BFD* recovered genetic species boundaries that are generally reflected in the morphological differences of the growth forms and upheld the species designations of I. campana and I. strobilina, whereas CO1 and ITS provided comparatively little species-level phylogenetic resolution. The microbiomes were found to be compositionally distinct relative to seawater microbial communities, conserved within host lineages, and non-overlapping relative to the microbiomes of other host lineages. These results support a model by which microbiomes underly ecological divergence in resource use among closely related sponge species. This research provides insights into the roles of microbiomes in ecological speciation of sponges and sets the groundwork for further investigation of adaptive radiations in sponges.",

Methods for quantifying gene expression1 and chromatin accessibility2 of single cells are now well-established, but analysis of chromatin regions with specific histone modifications has been technically challenging. Here, we adapt the recently published CUT&Tag method3 to scalable single-cell platforms to profile chromatin landscapes in single cells (scCUT&Tag) from complex tissues. We focus on profiling Polycomb Group (PcG) silenced regions marked by H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in single cells as an orthogonal approach to chromatin accessibility for identifying cell states. We show that scCUT&Tag profiling of H3K27me3 distinguishes cell types in human blood and allows the generation of cell-type-specific PcG landscapes from heterogeneous tissues. Furthermore, we use scCUT&Tag to profile H3K27me3 in a brain tumor patient before and after treatment, identifying cell types in the tumor microenvironment and heterogeneity in PcG activity in the primary sample and after treatment.",

    "abstract": "Although the evolution of cognitive differences among species has long been of interest in ecology, whether natural selection acts on cognitive processes within populations has only begun to receive similar attention. One of the key challenges is to understand how consistently cognitive traits within any one domain are expressed over time and across different contexts, as this has direct implications for the way in which selection might act on this variation. Animal studies typically measure a cognitive domain using only one task in one context, and assume that this captures the likely expression of that domain in different contexts. This deficit is not surprising because, from an ecologists perspective, cognitive tasks are notoriously laborious to employ, and for design reasons most tasks can only be deployed in a specific context. Thus our knowledge of whether individual differences in cognitive abilities are consistent across contexts is limited. Using a wild population of great tits (Parus major) we characterised consistency of two cognitive abilities, each in two different contexts: 1) spatial learning at two different spatial scales, and 2) behavioural flexibility as both performance in a detour reaching task and reversal learning in a spatial task. We found no evidence of a correlation between the two spatial learning speeds, or between the two measures of behavioural flexibility. This suggests that cognitive performance is highly plastic and sensitive to differences across tasks, or that variants of these well-known tasks may tap into different combinations of both cognitive and non-cognitive mechanisms, or that they simply do not adequately measure each putative cognitive domain. Our results highlight the challenges of developing standardised cognitive assays to explain natural behaviour and to understand the selective consequences of that variation.",

Time-resolved, 24-hour measurement of label incorporation allowed detection of over 500 newly synthesized proteins in viable cells, demonstrating low but widespread protein synthesis during persistance. Many essential proteins were newly synthesized and several ribosome-associated proteins, such as RaiA and Sra showed high synthesis levels, pointing to their roles in maintenance of persistence. At the onset of resuscitation, cells synthesized the ribosome-splitting GTPase HflX and various ABC transporters, restored translation machinery and resumed metabolism by inducing glycolysis and biosynthesis of amino acids.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the population structure of the newly emerged coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has significant potential to inform public health management and diagnosis. As SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data accrued, grouping them into clusters is important for organizing the landscape of the population structure of the virus. Due to the limited prior information on the newly emerged coronavirus, we utilized four different clustering algorithms to group 16,873 SARS-CoV-2 strains, which automatically enables the identification of spatial structure for SARS-CoV-2. A total of six distinct genomic clusters were identified using mutation profiles as input features. Comparison of the clustering results reveals that the four algorithms produced highly consistent results, but the state-of-the-art unsupervised deep learning clustering algorithm performed best and produced the smallest intra-cluster pairwise genetic distances. The varied proportions of the six clusters within different continents revealed specific geographical distributions. In particular, our analysis found that Oceania was the only continent on which the strains were dispersively distributed into six clusters. In summary, this study provides a concrete framework for the use of clustering methods to study the global population structure of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, clustering methods can be used for future studies of variant population structures in specific regions of these fast-growing viruses.",

    "abstract": "Canavan disease is a severe progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by swelling and spongy degeneration of brain white matter. The disease is genetically linked to polymorphisms in the aspartoacylase (ASPA) gene, including the substitution C152W. ASPA C152W is associated with greatly reduced protein levels in cells, yet biophysical experiments suggest a wild-type like thermal stability. Here, we examine the stability and degradation pathway of ASPA C152W. When we expressed ASPA C152W in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found a decreased steady state compared to wild-type ASPA as a result of increased proteasomal degradation. However, molecular dynamics simulations of ASPA C152W did not substantially deviate from wild-type ASPA, indicating that the native state is structurally preserved. Instead, we suggest that the C152W substitution prevents ASPA from reaching its stable native conformation, presumably by impacting on de novo folding. Systematic mapping of the protein quality control components acting on misfolded and aggregation-prone species of C152W, revealed that the degradation is highly dependent on the molecular chaperone Hsp70, its co-chaperone Hsp110 as well as several quality control E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases, including Ubr1. In human cells, ASPA C152W displayed increased proteasomal turnover that was similarly dependent on Hsp70 and Hsp110. We propose that Hsp110 is a potential therapeutic target for misfolding ASPA variants that trigger Canavan disease due to excessive degradation.",

Proteomic studies and other approaches have provided evidence of compromised cellular processes in the disorder, including mitochondrial function. Most of the studies so far have been conducted on postmortem brain tissue from patients and do not allow the evaluation of the neurodevelopmental aspect of the disorder. To circumvent that, we studied the mitochondrial and nuclear proteomes of neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from schizophrenia patients versus healthy controls. Our results revealed differentially regulated proteins in pathways related to mitochondrial function, oxidative phosphorylation, cell cycle control, DNA repair, and neuritogenesis. Moreover, metabolic analysis of NSCs revealed alterations in mitochondrial function in schizophrenia-derived cells. Hence, this study shows that changes in important cellular processes are present during neurodevelopment and could be involved with the establishment of schizophrenia, as well as the phenotypic traits observed in adult patients.",

To enhance their experimental scope, it is important to optimize fluorescent proteins for two-photon excitation. Directed evolution of fluorescent proteins under one-photon excitation is common, but many one-photon properties do not correlate with two-photon properties. A simple system for expressing fluorescent protein mutants is E. coli colonies on an agar plate. The small focal volume of two-photon excitation makes creating a high throughput screen in this system a challenge for a conventional point-scanning approach. We present an instrument and accompanying software that solves this challenge by selectively scanning each colony based on a colony map captured under one-photon excitation. This instrument, called the GIZMO, can measure the two-photon excited fluorescence of 10,000 E. coli colonies in 7 hours. We show that the GIZMO can be used to evolve a fluorescent protein under two-photon excitation.",

    "abstract": "To systematically investigate the complexity of neuron-specification regulatory networks we performed an RNA interference (RNAi) screen against all 875 transcription factors (TFs) encoded in Caenorhabditis elegans genome and searched for defects in nine different neuron types of the monoaminergic (MA) superclass and two cholinergic motoneurons.\n\nWe identified 91 TF candidates to be required for correct generation of these neuron types of which 28 were confirmed by mutant analysis. We found that correct reporter expression in each individual neuron type requires at least nine different TFs. Individual neuron types do not usually share TFs involved in their specification but share a common pattern of TFs belonging to the five most common TF families: Homeodomain (HD), basic Helix Loop Helix (bHLH), Zinc Finger (ZF), Basic Leucine Zipper Domain (bZIP) and Nuclear Hormone Receptors (NHR). HD TF members are over-represented, supporting a key role for this family in the establishment of neuronal identities. These five TF families area also prevalent when considering mutant alleles with previously reported neuronal phenotypes in C. elegans, Drosophila or mouse. In addition, we studied terminal differentiation complexity focusing on the dopaminergic terminal regulatory program. We found two HD TFs (UNC-62 and VAB-3) that work together with known dopaminergic terminal selectors (AST-1, CEH-43, CEH-20). Combined TF binding sites for these five TFs constitute a cis-regulatory signature enriched in the regulatory regions of dopaminergic effector genes. Our results provide new insights on neuron-type regulatory programs in C. elegans that could help better understand neuron specification and evolution of neuron types.",

An allosteric mechanism links initial sensing of DNA single-strand breaks by PARP-1s F1 and F2 domains via a process of further domain assembly to activation of the catalytic domain (CAT); synthesis and attachment of poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains to protein sidechains then signals for assembly of DNA repair components. A key component in transmission of the allosteric signal is the HD subdomain of CAT, which alone bridges between the assembled DNA-binding domains and the active site in the ART subdomain of CAT. Here we present a study of isolated CAT domain from human PARP-1, using NMR-based dynamics experiments to analyse WT apo-protein as well as a set of inhibitor complexes (with veliparib, olaparib, talazoparib and EB-47) and point mutants (L713F, L765A and L765F), together with new crystal structures of the free CAT domain and inhibitor complexes. Variations in both dynamics and structures amongst these species point to a model for full-length PARP-1 activation where first DNA binding and then substrate interaction successively destabilise the folded structure of the HD subdomain to the point where its steric blockade of the active site is released and PAR synthesis can proceed.",

For most of these proteins, the fold changes between late-stage OA vs controls and early stage OA vs controls were remarkably similar suggesting potential involvement in the OA process. Further, for the first time this study illustrated distinct patterns in protein co-expression suggesting that the global interplay between the protein machinery is increased in early-OA and lost in late-stage OA.

Despite their essential functions for animal fertility and embryonic development, how CSR-1 22G-RNAs are produced remains unknown. Here, we show that CSR-1 slicer activity is primarily involved in triggering the synthesis of small RNAs on the coding sequences of germline mRNAs and post-transcriptionally regulates a fraction of targets. CSR-1-cleaved mRNAs prime the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, EGO-1, to synthesize 22G-RNAs in phase with ribosome translation in the cytoplasm, in contrast to other 22G-RNAs mostly synthesized in germ granules. Moreover, codon optimality and efficient translation antagonize CSR-1 slicing and 22G-RNAs biogenesis. We propose that codon usage differences encoded into mRNA sequences might be a conserved strategy in eukaryotes to regulate small RNA biogenesis and Argonaute targeting.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe clock and wavefront paradigm is arguably the most widely accepted model for explaining the embryonic process of somitogenesis. According to this model, somitogenesis is based upon the interaction between a genetic oscillator, known as segmentation clock, and a differentiation wavefront, which provides the positional information indicating where each pair of somites is formed. Shortly after the clock and wavefront paradigm was introduced, Meinhardt presented a conceptually different mathematical model for morphogenesis in general, and somitogenesis in particular. Recently, Cotterell et al. rediscovered an equivalent model by systematically enumerating and studying small networks performing segmentation. Cotterell et al. called it a progressive oscillatory reaction-diffusion (PORD) model. In the Meinhardt-PORD model, somitogenesis is driven by short-range interactions and the posterior movement of the front is a local, emergent phenomenon, which is not controlled by global positional information. With this model, it is possible to explain some experimental observations that are incompatible with the clock and wavefront model. However the Meinhardt-PORD model has some important disadvantages of its own. Namely, it is quite sensitive to fluctuations and depends on very specific initial conditions (which are not biologically realistic). In this work, we propose an equivalent Meinhardt-PORD model, and then amend it to couple it with a wavefront consisting of a receding morphogen gradient. By doing so, we get a hybrid model between the Meinhardt-PORD and the clock-and-wavefront ones, which overcomes most of the deficiencies of the two originating models.\n\nSomitogenesis, the process by which somites are formed, is an essential developmental stage in many vertebrates. This process occurs with a strikingly regular periodicity, that is preserved among embryos of a single species. The clock and wavefront paradigm is arguably the most widely accepted model for explaining somitogenesis. However, it is incapable of explaining some experimental facts, like the appearance of somites in the absence of an external wavefront (i.e. a receding morphogen gradient). Shortly after the clock and wavefront paradigm was introduced, Meinhardt presented a conceptually different mathematical model for morphogenesis in general, and somitogenesis in particular. Recently, Cotterell et al. rediscovered an equivalent model by systematically enumerating and studying small networks performing segmentation, and called it a progressive oscillatory reaction-diffusion (PORD) model. The Meinhardt-PORD model tackles some of the deficiencies of the clock and wave-front models, but it has some serious issues of its own. In the present work, we introduce an equivalent Meinhardt-PORD model, and then amend it to couple it with a receding morphogen gradient. By doing so, we get a hybrid model that incorporates characteristics of the Meinhardt-PORD and clock-and-wavefront models. We show that this hybrid model under-goes a bifurcation, from a stable to an unstable limit cycle, as the value of the parameter accounting for a background regulatory input (associated to the receding morphogen gradient) decreases. This bifurcation allows the model to explain why somites can form in the absence of an external wavefront, reassesses the role of the receding morphogen gradient as a conductor for somitogenesis, and makes the model behavior robust to random fluctuations, as well as independent from specific initial conditions (the latter, are two of the weak points of the Meinhardt-PORD model). We argue that this findings provide convincing evidence that reaction-diffusion and positional information (receding morphogen gradient) mechanisms could work together in somitogenesis.",

Although body size has profound effects on the behavior, physiology, ecology, and evolution of animals, how investment in immune defenses changes with body size is unknown. Here, we develop a novel 12-point dilution-curve approach to describe and compare antibacterial capacity against 3 bacterial species among >160 terrestrial species of mammals. We show that antibacterial activity in serum across mammals exhibits isometry, but the serum of large mammals is less hospitable to bacteria than would be predicted by their metabolic rates. Specifically, hypometric metabolic rates would predict that a large species should have disproportionately lower antibacterial capacity than small species, but body size is unrelated to killing capacity across species. Scaling of antibacterial immune defenses provides novel perspectives on the ecology of host-pathogen interactions, and on their co-evolutionary dynamics. These results have direct implications for effectively modeling the evolution of immune defenses and identifying potential reservoir hosts of zoonotic pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Independent origins of sociality in bees and ants are associated with independent expansions of particular odorant receptor (OR) gene subfamilies. In ants, one clade within the OR gene family, the 9-exon subfamily, has dramatically expanded. These receptors detect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs), key social signaling molecules in insects. It is unclear to what extent 9-exon OR subfamily expansion is associated with the independent evolution of sociality across Hymenoptera, warranting studies of taxa with independently derived social behavior. Here we describe odorant receptor gene family evolution in the northern paper wasp, Polistes fuscatus, and compare it to four additional paper wasp species spanning ~40 million years of divergence. We find 200 functional OR genes in P. fuscatus matching predictions from neuroanatomy, and more than half of these are in the 9-exon subfamily. Lineage-specific expansions of 9-exon subfamily ORs are tandemly arrayed in Polistes genomes and exhibit a breakdown in microsynteny relative to tandem arrays in other OR subfamilies. There is evidence of episodic positive diversifying selection shaping ORs in expanded subfamilies, including 9-exon, E, H, and L, but 9-exon ORs do not stand out as selectively diversified among Polistes species. Accelerated evolution has resulted in lower amino acid similarity and high dN/dS among 9-exon ORs compared to other OR subfamilies. Patterns of OR evolution within Polistes are consistent with 9-exon OR function in CHC perception by combinatorial coding, with both selection and drift contributing to interspecies differences in copy number and sequence.",

    "abstract": "Many enveloped viruses such as HIV have evolved to transmit by two infection modes: cell-free infection and cell-to-cell spread. Cell-to-cell spread is highly efficient as it involves directed viral transmission from the infected to the uninfected cell. In contrast, cell-free infection relies on chance encounters between the virion and cell. Despite the higher efficiency of cell-to-cell spread, there is substantial transmission by cell-free infection in conjunction with cell-to-cell spread. A possible reason is that cell-free infection offers a selective advantage by increasing sensitivity to factors interfering with infection, hence accelerating evolution of resistance relative to cell-to-cell spread alone. Here we investigated whether a combination of cell-free infection and cell-to-cell spread confers a selective advantage in experimental evolution to an antiretroviral drug. We maintained HIV infection using coculture of infected with uninfected cells in the face of moderate inhibition by the reverse transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz. We tested the effect on the rate of drug resistance evolution of replacing one coculture infection cycle with an infection cycle involving cell-free infection only, and observed earlier evolution of drug resistance mutations to efavirenz. When we increased selective pressure by adding a second reverse transcriptase inhibitor, emtricitabine, infection with the cell-free step consistently evolved multidrug resistance to both drugs and was able to replicate. In contrast, infection without a cell-free step mostly failed to evolve multidrug resistance. Therefore, HIV cell-to-cell spread decreases the ability of HIV to rapidly evolve resistance to inhibitors, which is conferred by cell-free infection.\n\nAuthor summaryCell-to-cell spread of HIV differs from cell-free, diffusion-based HIV infection in that viral transmission is directed from the infected to the uninfected cell through cellular interactions. Cell-to-cell spread has been recognized as a highly efficient infection mode that is able to surmount inhibition by antibodies and antiretroviral drugs. However, the effect of HIV cell-to-cell spread on the rate of evolution of viral resistance to infection inhibitors has not been studied. Here we used experimental evolution to investigate the effect of cell-to-cell spread versus cell-free infection on the emergence of drug resistance mutations to one or a combination of antiretroviral drugs. We found that replacing one infection cycle in experimental evolution with cell-free infection, where the filtered supernatant from infected cells, but not the cellular fraction, is used as the viral source, results in more rapid evolution of resistance. The consequences are that multidrug resistance consistently evolves with a cell-free viral cycle, but not when infection is solely by coculture of infected and uninfected cells. A possible consequence is that in environments where HIV cell-to-cell spread may predominate and some residual viral replication occurs in the face of ART, the emergence of drug resistance mutations would be delayed.",

    "abstract": "Exceptionally long-lived species, including many bats, rarely show overt signs of aging, making it difficult to determine why species differ in lifespan. Here, we use DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles from 712 known-age bats, representing 26 species, to identify epigenetic changes associated with age and longevity. We demonstrate that DNAm accurately predicts chronological age. Across species, longevity is negatively associated with the rate of DNAm change at age-associated sites. Furthermore, analysis of several bat genomes reveals that hypermethylated age- and longevity-associated sites are disproportionately located in promoter regions of key transcription factors (TF) and enriched for histone and chromatin features associated with transcriptional regulation. Predicted TF binding site motifs and enrichment analyses indicate that age-related methylation change is influenced by developmental processes, while longevity-related DNAm change is associated with innate immunity or tumorigenesis genes, suggesting that bat longevity results from augmented immune response and cancer suppression.",

Genetic and epigenetic regulation of genes relies on structural transitions in chromatin which are driven by intra- and internucleosome dynamics and modulated by chemical modifications of the unstructured terminal tails of histones. Here we demonstrate how the interplay between histone H3 and H2A tails control ample nucleosome breathing motions. We monitored large openings of two genomic nucleosomes, and only moderate breathing of an engineered nucleosome in atomistic molecular simulations amounting to 18s. Transitions between open and closed nucleosome conformations were driven by the displacement and changes in compaction of the two histone tails. These motions involved changes in the DNA interaction profiles of clusters of epigenetic regulatory aminoacids in the tails. Histone tail modulated nucleosome breathing is a key mechanism of chromatin dynamics.",

How surface properties ensure ring assembly with proper symmetry and orthogonal arrangement is not known. Here, we deployed photothermally-actuated off-resonance tapping high-speed atomic force microscopy (PORT-HS-AFM) to decipher physical principles of surface-guided SAS-6 self-assembly. Using machine learning to quantify the polymerization reaction and developing a coagulation-fragmentation model, we discovered that the surface shifts the reaction equilibrium by [~]104 compared to the solution situation, explaining orthogonal organelle emergence. Moreover, molecular dynamics and PORT-HS-AFM revealed that the surface converts helical SAS-6 polymers into 9-fold ring polymers with residual asymmetry, which may impart chiral features to centrioles and cilia. Overall, we discovered two fundamental physical principles directing robust centriole organelle assembly.",

We identified that WIP1-phosphatase encoded by PPM1D, is activated by frequent segmental 17q-gain further accumulated during clonal evolution, gene-amplifications, gene-fusions or gain-of-function somatic and germline mutations. Pharmacological and genetic manipulation established WIP1 as a druggable target in neuroblastoma.

Establishing a transgenic mouse model overexpressing PPM1D showed that these mice develop cancers phenotypically and genetically similar to tumors arising in mice with dysfunctional p53 when subjected to low-dose irradiation. Tumors include T-cell lymphomas harboring Notch1-mutations, Pten-deletions and p53-accumulation, adenocarcinomas and PHOX2B-expressing neuroblastomas establishing PPM1D as a bona fide oncogene in wtTP53 cancer and childhood neuroblastoma.

We show that cellular lineages, states, and transcriptomic features geospatially evolve across normal regions to LUADs.

T regulatory cell phenotypes are increased in normal tissues with proximity to LUAD, in contrast to diminished signatures and fractions of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, antigen-presenting macrophages and inflammatory dendritic cells. We further find that the LUAD ligand-receptor interactome harbors increased expression of epithelial CD24 which mediates pro-tumor phenotypes. These data provide a spatial atlas of LUAD evolution, and a resource for identification of targets for its treatment.\n\nStatement of significanceThe geospatial ecosystem of the peripheral lung and early-stage LUAD is not known.

The prognostic effect of non-K700E SF3B1mut is uncertain.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed the clinical-pathologic features and outcomes of a single-institutional series of 94 SF3B1mut and 415 SF3B1wt newly diagnosed untreated MDS patients and explored the differences between K700E and non-K700E subgroups.\n\nFindingsNinety-four (19%) patients had SF3B1mut: median age, 74 years. Fifty-five (60%) patients carried K700E. Recurrent non-K700E mutations (39, 40%) included R625, H662 and K666. Compared to SF3B1mut K700E, non-K700E patients had a lower median ANC (1{middle dot}8 vs. 2{middle dot}4, p=0{middle dot}005) and were frequently \"high\" R-IPSS (revised International Prognostic Scoring System) [7(19%) vs. 2(4%), p=0{middle dot}031]. Non-K700E MDS frequently associated with RUNX1 (26% vs. 7%, p=0{middle dot}012) and exclusively with BCOR, IDH2, and SRSF2 mutations. There was no significant difference in karyotype or SF3B1 variant allele frequency. Most ([~]80%) were treated with hypomethylating agents. SF3B1mut had superior overall survival (OS) than SF3B1wt in all MDS categories [not-reached vs. 25{middle dot}2 months, p=0{middle dot}0003], low-grade MDS, and MDS with ring sideroblasts (MDS-RS). Compared to SF3B1wt, SF3B1mut K700E had superior outcomes in all MDS categories (25 months vs. not-reached, p=0{middle dot}0001), low-grade MDS, and MDS-RS, but no significant difference was seen with non-K700E. By multivariate analysis, absence of SF3B1mut K700E (not non-K700E) independently associated with prognosis.\n\nInterpretationSF3B1mut MDS show distinct clinical and mutational profiles, with K700E showing a significantly better OS compared to non-K700E mutations and SF3B1wt. Our study highlights the importance of SF3B1 mutation type in MDS risk assessment.\n\nData Sharing StatementThe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are not publicly available due to patient privacy concerns but are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\nResearch in ContextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe designed this study based on the collective evidence from a systematic search of the literature for outcomes of patients MDS with SF3B1 mutations (SF3B1mut) from January 2013 to June 2020. Both the International Working Group for the Prognosis of MDS (IWG-PM) proposal and 2016 revisions to the World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Myelodysplastic Syndromes recognize SF3B1mut MDS with <5% blasts (or ring sideroblasts >5% for WHO) as a distinct sub-category, in the absence of other unfavorable features. This was largely based on favorable prognostic outcomes, a distinct gene expression profile, and association with ring sideroblasts. However, the natural history of SF3B1mut MDS is heterogeneous. A high proportion of SF3B1 mutations occur within codon K700, leading to large-scale mRNA downregulation due to branch point recognition error, while the rest occur outside of this codon. The downstream functional effects of SF3B1 mutations outside of the K700 codon are unclear. The clinical course of SF3B1mut MDS patients likely depends on the type of SF3B1 mutation and other features such as variant allele frequency, concomitant gene mutations, and karyotype. Until now, the effects of the different types of SF3B1 mutations were largely unknown.\n\nAdded value of this studyIn this study, we report distinctive clinicopathologic characteristics and outcomes of MDS patients with SF3B1 mutations segregated based on mutation type: K700E vs. non-K700E. We show that [~]40% of SF3B1 mutated MDS patients have non-K700E mutations. Non-K700E SF3B1mut MDS have distinct clinico-pathologic features, such as lower ANC and frequent association with mutations in RUNX1, BCOR, IDH2, and SRSF2. There was no significant difference in karyotype or SF3B1 variant allele frequency. Importantly, K700E SF3B1mut MDS had superior overall survival compared to SF3B1wt, in all MDS, low-grade MDS, and MDS with ring sideroblasts, but no significant difference was seen with non-K700E. By multivariate analysis, absence of SF3B1mut K700E, but not non-K700E, independently associated with prognosis.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report these findings from a single-institutional series of MDS primarily treated with hypomethylating agents. Our study highlights the importance of determining the SF3B1 mutation type in MDS risk assessment. These findings are important in light of the recent FDA approval of luspatercept based on the results of the MEDALIST trial that suggested sustained hematological responses in SF3B1mut MDS patients.",

    "abstract": "A major disease affecting sugarcane, a leading sugar and energy crop, is sugarcane yellow leaf (SCYL), caused by the sugarcane yellow leaf virus (SCYLV). Despite damages caused by SCYLV, the genetic basis of resistance to this virus remains largely unknown. Several methodologies have arisen to identify molecular markers associated with SCYLV resistance, which are crucial for marker-assisted selection and understanding response mechanisms to this virus. We investigated the genetic basis of SCYLV resistance using dominant and codominant markers and genotypes of interest for breeding. A sugarcane panel inoculated with SCYLV was analyzed for SCYL symptoms, and viral titer was estimated by RT-qPCR. This panel was genotyped with 662 dominant markers and 70,888 SNPs and indels with allele proportion information. We used polyploid-adapted genome-wide association analyses and machine-learning algorithms coupled with feature selection methods to establish marker-trait associations. While each approach identified unique marker sets associated with phenotypes, convergences were observed between them, demonstrating their complementarity. Lastly, we annotated these markers, identifying genes encoding emblematic participants in virus resistance mechanisms and previously unreported candidates involved in viral responses. Our approach could accelerate sugarcane breeding targeting SCYLV resistance and facilitate studies on biological processes leading to this trait.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have identified two distinct cortical representations of voice control in humans, the ventral and the dorsal laryngeal motor cortex. Strikingly, while persistent developmental stuttering has been linked to a white matter deficit in the ventral laryngeal motor cortex, intensive fluency shaping intervention modulated the functional connectivity of the dorsal laryngeal motor cortical network. Currently, it is unknown whether the underlying structural network organization of these two laryngeal representations is distinct or differently shaped by stuttering intervention. Using probabilistic diffusion tractography in 22 individuals who stutter and participated in a fluency shaping intervention, in 18 individuals who stutter and did not participate in the intervention, and in 28 control participants, we here compare structural networks of the dorsal laryngeal motor cortex and the ventral laryngeal motor cortex and test intervention-related white matter changes. We show (i) that all participants have weaker ventral laryngeal motor cortex connections compared to the dorsal laryngeal motor cortex network, regardless of speech fluency, (ii) connections of the ventral laryngeal motor cortex were stronger in fluent speakers, (iii) the connectivity profile of the ventral laryngeal motor cortex predicted stuttering severity, (iv) but the ventral laryngeal motor cortex network is resistant to a fluency shaping intervention. Our findings substantiate a weaker structural organization of the ventral laryngeal motor cortical network in developmental stuttering and imply that assisted recovery supports neural compensation rather than normalization. Moreover, the resulting dissociation provides evidence for functionally segregated roles of the ventral laryngeal motor cortical and dorsal laryngeal motor cortical networks.",

    "abstract": "Segregation and integration are two fundamental principles of brain structural and functional organization. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the brain transits between different functionally segregated and integrated states, and neuromodulatory systems have been proposed as key to facilitate these transitions. Although computational models have reproduced the effect of neuromodulation at the whole-brain level, the role of local inhibitory circuits and their cholinergic modulation has not been studied. In this article, we consider a Jansen & Rit whole-brain model in a network interconnected using a human connectome, and study the influence of the cholinergic and noradrenergic neuromodulatory systems on the segregation/integration balance. In our model, a newly introduced local inhibitory feedback enables the integration of whole-brain activity, and its modulation interacts with the other neuromodulatory influences to facilitate the transit between different functional states. Moreover, the new proposed model is able to reproduce an inverted-U relationship between noradrenergic modulation and network integration. Our work proposes a new possible mechanism behind segregation and integration in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Mosquitoes rely heavily on their olfactory systems for host seeking, selection of oviposition sites, and avoiding predators and other environmental dangers. Of these behaviors, the preferential selection of a human blood-meal host drives the vectorial capacity of anthropophilic female Anopheles coluzzii mosquitoes. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) are dispersed across several appendages on the head and express an obligate odorant receptor co-receptor (Orco) coupled with a \"tuning\" odorant receptor (OR) to form heteromeric, odor-gated ion channels in the membrane of these neurons. To examine the mechanistic and functional contributions of Orco/OR complexes to the chemosensory processes of An. coluzzii, we utilized CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to create a line of homozygous, Orco-knockout, mutant mosquitoes. As expected, orco-/- ORNs across both adult and larval stages of An. coluzzii display significantly lower background activity and lack nearly all odor-evoked responses. In addition, blood-meal-seeking, adult female, orco- /- mutant mosquitoes exhibit severely reduced attraction to human- and non-human-derived odors while gravid females are significantly less responsive to established oviposition attractants. These results reinforce observations in other insects that Orco is crucial in maintaining the activity of ORNs. In that light, it significantly influences a range of olfactory-driven behaviors central to the anthropophilic host preference that is critical to the vectorial capacity of An. coluzzii as a primary vector for human malaria.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundElucidation of immune populations with single-cell RNA-seq has greatly benefited the field of immunology by deepening the characterization of immune heterogeneity and leading to the discovery of new subtypes. However, single-cell methods inherently suffer from limitations in the recovery of complete transcriptomes due to the prevalence of cellular and transcriptional dropout events. This issue is often compounded by limited sample availability and limited prior knowledge of heterogeneity, which can confound data interpretation.\n\nResultsHere, we systematically benchmarked seven high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq methods. We prepared 21 libraries under identical conditions of a defined mixture of two human and two murine lymphocyte cell lines, simulating heterogeneity across immune-cell types and cell sizes. We evaluate methods by their cell recovery rate, library efficiency, sensitivity, and ability to recover expression signatures for each cell type. We observed higher mRNA detection sensitivity with the 10x Genomics 5 v1 and 3 v3 methods. We demonstrate that these methods have fewer drop-out events which facilitates the identification of differentially-expressed genes and improves the concordance of single-cell profiles to immune bulk RNA-seq signatures.\n\nConclusionOverall, our characterization of immune cell mixtures provides useful metrics, which can guide selection of a high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq method for profiling more complex immune-cell heterogeneity usually found in vivo.",

In this study we focus on the profibrotic properties of airway basal cells (ABC) obtained from patients with IPF (IPF-ABC). Single cell RNA sequencing of bronchial brushes revealed extensive reprogramming of IPF-ABC towards a KRT17high PTENlow dedifferentiated cell type. In the 3D organoid model, compared to ABC obtained from healthy volunteers, IPF-ABC give rise to more bronchospheres, de novo bronchial structures resembling lung developmental processes, induce fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition in co-culture. Intratracheal application of IPF-ABC into minimally injured lungs of Rag2-/- or NRG mice causes severe fibrosis, remodeling of the alveolar compartment, and formation of honeycomb cyst-like structures. Connectivity MAP analysis of scRNA seq of bronchial brushings suggested that gene expression changes in IPF-ABC can be reversed by SRC inhibition. After demonstrating enhanced SRC expression and activity in these cells, and in IPF lungs, we tested the effects of saracatinib, a potent SRC inhibitor previously studied in humans.

We parsed the complex FGF intracellular response by creating triple homozygous mutants in the Pea3 subgroup of ETS transcription factors, designated 3etv mutants. The Pea3 proteins Etv4 and Etv5 are expressed in areas of FGF activity; however, their role in FGF signal transduction as either positive or negative modulators of FGF activity was unclear. Using 3etv mutants, we found these genes act redundantly and have phenotypes consistent with known FGF defects in inner ear, pectoral fin, and posterior mesoderm development. Additionally, we uncovered a novel role for the FGF/Pea3 pathway during body axis straightening. 3etv larvae develop a curly-tail up (CTU) phenotype that we linked to mis-regulation of the polycystin and urotensin pathways, which have opposing actions to ensure a straight body orientation along the dorsal-ventral axis. We find that the Etv4/5 transcription factors act as positive regulators of FGF signaling and propose a model where Etv4/5 are required for cilia function downstream of Fgf8a.\n\nSummary StatementPea3 transcription factor triple mutants reveal a role for FGF signaling in balancing polycystin and urotensin signaling to achieve a straight body axis.",

    "abstract": "Reticulate evolutionary events are hallmarks of plant phylogeny, and are increasingly recognized as common occurrences in other branches of the Tree of Life. However, inferring the evolutionary history of admixed lineages presents a difficult challenge for systematists due to genealogical discordance caused by both incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) and hybridization. Methods that accommodate both of these processes are continuing to be developed, but they often do not scale well to larger numbers of species. An additional complicating factor for many plant species is the occurrence of whole genome duplication (WGD), which can have various outcomes on the genealogical history of haplotypes sampled from the genome. In this study, we sought to investigate patterns of hybridization and WGD in two subsections from the genus Penstemon (Plantaginaceae; subsect. Humiles and Proceri), a speciose group of angiosperms that has rapidly radiated across North America. Species in subsect. Humiles and Proceri occur primarily in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, occupying habitats such as mesic, subalpine meadows, as well as more well-drained substrates at varying elevations. Ploidy levels in the subsections range from diploid to hexaploid, and it is hypothesized that most of the polyploids are hybrids (i.e., allopolyploids). To estimate phylogeny in these groups, we first developed a method for estimating quartet concordance factors (QCFs) from multiple sequences sampled per lineage, allowing us to model all haplotypes from a polyploid. QCFs represent the proportion of gene trees that support a particular species quartet relationship, and are used for species network estimation in the program SNaQ (Solis-Lemus & Ane. 2016. PLoS Genet. 12:e1005896). Using phased haplotypes for nuclear amplicons, we inferred species trees and networks for 38 taxa from P. subsect. Humiles and Proceri. Our phylogenetic analyses recovered two clades comprising a mix of taxa from both subsections, indicating that the current taxonomy for these groups is inconsistent with our estimates of phylogeny. In addition, there was little support for hypotheses regarding the formation of putative allopolyploid lineages. Overall, we found evidence for the effects of both ILS and admixture on the evolutionary history of these species, but were able to evaluate our taxonomic hypotheses despite high levels of gene tree discordance. Our method for estimating QCFs from multiple haplotypes also allowed us to include species of varying ploidy levels in our analyses, which we anticipate will help to facilitate estimation of species networks in other plant groups as well.",

In doing so, we discovered three series of fragments that occupy distinct regions of the MtbPPAT active site, presenting a unique opportunity for fragment linking.

    "abstract": "PurposeIn connective tissues there is a clear link between increasing age and degeneration. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are believed to play a central role. AGEs are sugar-induced non-enzymatic crosslinks which accumulate in collagen with age and diabetes, altering tissue mechanics and cellular function. Despite ample correlative evidence linking collagen glycation to tissue degeneration, little is known how AGEs impact cell-matrix interactions, limiting therapeutic options. One reason for this limited understanding is AGEs are typically induced using high concentrations of ribose which decrease cell viability, making it impossible to investigate cell-matrix interactions. The objective of this study was to develop a system to trigger AGE accumulation while maintaining cell viability.\n\nMaterials and MethodsUsing cell-seeded high density collagen gels, we investigated the effect of two systems for AGE induction, ribose at low concentrations (30, 100, and 200 mM) over 15 days of culture and riboflavin (0.25 mM and 0.75mM) induced with blue light for 40 seconds (riboflavin-465 nm).\n\nResultsWe found ribose and riboflavin-465 nm treatment produces fluorescent AGE quantities which match and/or exceed human fluorescent AGE levels for various tissues, ages, and diseases, without affecting cell viability or metabolism. Interestingly, a 40 second treatment of riboflavin-465 nm produced similar levels of fluorescent AGEs as 3 days of 100 mM ribose treatment.\n\nConclusionsRiboflavin-465 nm is a promising method to trigger AGE crosslinks on demand in vivo or in vitro without impacting cell viability and offers potential for unraveling the mechanism of AGEs in age and diabetes related tissue damage.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning has emerged as a revolutionary technology for protein residue-residue contact prediction since the 2012 CASP10 competition. Considerable advancements in the predictive power of the deep learning-based contact predictions have been achieved since then. However, little effort has been put into interpreting the black-box deep learning methods. Algorithms that can interpret the relationship between predicted contact maps and the internal mechanism of the deep learning architectures are needed to explore the essential components of contact inference and improve their explainability. In this study, we present an attention-based convolutional neural network for protein contact prediction, which consists of two attention mechanism-based modules: sequence attention and regional attention. Our benchmark results on the CASP13 free-modeling (FM) targets demonstrate that the two attention modules added on top of existing typical deep learning models exhibit a complementary effect that contributes to predictive improvements. More importantly, the inclusion of the attention mechanism provides interpretable patterns that contain useful insights into the key fold-determining residues in proteins. We expect the attention-based model can provide a reliable and practically interpretable technique that helps break the current bottlenecks in explaining deep neural networks for contact prediction.",

    "abstract": "The extent and function of chromatin state aberrations during colorectal cancer (CRC) progression is not completely understood. Here, by comprehensive epigenomic characterization of 56 tumors, adenomas, and their matched normal tissues, we define the dynamics of chromatin states during the progression of colorectal cancer. H3K27ac-marked active enhancer state could distinguish between different stages of CRC progression. By epigenomic editing, we present evidence that gains of tumor-specific enhancers for crucial oncogenes, such as ASCL2 and FZD10, was crucial for excessive proliferation. Consistently, combination of MEK plus bromodomain (BET) inhibition was found to have synergistic effects in CRC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. Probing inter-tumor heterogeneity, we identified four distinct enhancer subtypes (EpiC), three of which correlate well with previously defined transcriptomic subtypes (CMSs). Importantly, CMS2 can be divided into two EpiC subgroups with significant survival differences. Leveraging such correlation, we devised a combinatorial therapeutic strategy of enhancer-blocking bromodomain inhibitors with pathway-specific inhibitors (PARPi, EGFRi, and TGF{beta}i) for three EPIC groups. Our data suggest that the dynamics of active enhancer underlies colorectal cancer progression and the patient-specific active enhancer patterns govern their unique gene expression patterns which can be leveraged for precision combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "A central principle in our understanding of cerebral cortical organization is that homotopic left and right areas are functionally linked to each other, and also connected with structures that share similar functions within each cerebral cortical hemisphere. Here we refer to this concept as interhemispheric functional symmetry (IHFS). While multiple studies have described the distribution and variations of IHFS in the cerebral cortex, descriptions of IHFS in the subcortex are largely absent in the neuroscientific literature. Further, the proposed anatomical basis of IHFS is centered on callosal and other commissural tracts. These commissural fibers are present in virtually all cerebral cortical areas, but almost absent in the subcortex. There is thus an important knowledge gap in our understanding of subcortical IHFS. What is the distribution and variations of subcortical IHFS, and what are the anatomical correlates and physiological implications of this important property in the subcortex? Using fMRI functional gradient analyses in a large dataset (Human Connectome Project, n=1003), here we explored IHFS in human thalamus, lenticular nucleus, cerebellar cortex, and caudate nucleus. Our detailed descriptions provide an empirical foundation upon which to build hypotheses for the anatomical and physiological basis of subcortical IHFS. Our results indicate that direct or driver cerebral cortical afferent connectivity, as opposed to indirect or modulatory cerebral cortical afferent connectivity, is associated with stronger subcortical IHFS in thalamus and lenticular nucleus. In cerebellar cortex and caudate, where there is no variability in terms of either direct vs. indirect or driver vs. modulatory cerebral cortical afferent connections, connectivity to cerebral cortical areas with stronger cerebral cortical IHFS is associated with stronger IHFS in the subcortex. These two observations support a close relationship between subcortical IHFS and connectivity between subcortex and cortex, and generate new testable hypotheses that advance our understanding of subcortical organization.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) is an essential neurotransmitter modulating motor and cognitive functions. Several neurological disorders, including Parkinsons disease (PD) and drug addiction, are the result of DA system dysfunction; however, it remains incomplete understood of why DA neuron is selectively more vulnerable than other neurons. Here we utilize the spectral feature of human MAO B (monoamine oxidase B) to design a genetic-amenable, GFP-based fluorescent probe CyDAP. Upon genetic and pharmacological manipulations to elevate the cytosolic DA levels in cells and Drosophila models, CyDAP shows enhanced GFP emission, suggesting this probe is feasible for DA detection. Furthermore, we observe that expressing human -Synuclein in Drosophila elicited GFP emission from CyDAP, suggesting a link between cytosolic DA imbalance and regional vulnerability in PD context. Importantly, CyDAP can detect the change of cytosolic DA in live Drosophila brains, as demonstrated by time-lapse and the 4D light-sheet confocal recording. CyDAP may serve as a tool for evaluating metabolic deregulation of DA in brain models of PD and other DA system-related psychiatric disorders.",

We estimate the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies in District Srinagar.\n\nMethods2906 persons >18 years of age selected from hospital visitors across District Srinagar participated in the study. We tested samples for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies using a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay-based serologic test.\n\nResultsAge- and gender-standardized seroprevalence was 3.6% (95% CI 2.9% to 4.3%). Age 30-69 years, a recent history of symptoms of an influenza-like-illness, and a history of being placed under quarantine were significantly related to higher odds of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies. The estimated number of SARS-CoV-2 infections during the two weeks preceding the study, adjusted for test performance, was 32602 with an estimated (median) infection-to-known-case ratio of 46 (95% CI 36 to 57).\n\nConclusionsThe seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibodies is low in the District. A large proportion of the population is still susceptible to the infection. A sizeable number of infections remain undetected, and a substantial proportion of people with symptoms compatible with COVID-19 are not tested.",

    "abstract": "A single amino acid residue change in the exonuclease domain of human DNA polymerase {varepsilon}, P286R, is associated with the development of colorectal cancers, and has been shown to impart a mutagenic phenotype. Perhaps unexpectedly, the corresponding Pol {varepsilon} allele in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (pol2-P301R), was found to drive greater mutagenesis than exonuclease-deficient Pol {varepsilon} (pol2-4), a phenotype sometimes termed ultra-mutagenesis. By studying the impact on mutation frequency, type, replication-strand bias, and sequence context, we show that ultra-mutagenesis is commonly observed in cells carrying a range of cancer-associated Pol {varepsilon} exonuclease domain alleles. Similarities between mutations generated by these alleles and those generated in pol2-4 cells indicate a shared mechanism of mutagenesis that yields a mutation pattern similar to cancer Signature 14. Comparison of POL2 ultra-mutator with pol2-M644G, a mutant in the polymerase domain decreasing Pol {varepsilon} fidelity, revealed unexpected analogies in the sequence context and strand bias of mutations. Analysis of mutational patterns unique to exonuclease domain mutant cells suggests that backtracking of the polymerase, when the mismatched primer end cannot be accommodated in the proofreading domain, results in the observed increase in insertions and T>A mutations in specific sequence contexts.",

    "abstract": "Use of telomere length (TL) as a biomarker for various environmental exposures and diseases has increased in recent years. Various methods have been developed to measure telomere length. PCR-based methods remain wide-spread for population-based studies due to the high-throughput capability. While several studies have evaluated TL measurement methods, the results have been variable. We conducted a literature review of TL measurement cross-method comparison studies that included a PCR-based method published between January 1, 2002 and May 25, 2020. A total of 25 articles were found that matched the inclusion criteria. Papers were reviewed for quality of methodologic reporting of sample and DNA quality, PCR assay characteristics, sample blinding, and analytic approaches to determine final TL. Overall, methodologic reporting was low as assessed by two different reporting guidelines for qPCR-based TL measurement. There was a wide range in the reported correlation between methods (as assessed by Pearsons r) and few studies utilized the recommended intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for assessment of assay repeatability and methodologic comparisons. The sample size for nearly all studies was less than 100, raising concerns about statistical power. Overall, this review found that the current literature on the relation between TL measurement methods is lacking in validity and scientific rigor. In light of these findings, we present reporting guidelines for PCR-based TL measurement methods and results of analyses of the effect of assay repeatability (ICC) on statistical power of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Additional cross-laboratory studies with rigorous methodologic and statistical reporting, adequate sample size, and blinding are essential to accurately determine assay repeatability and replicability as well as the relation between TL measurement methods.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is one of the deadliest aspects of cancer. Initial Metastatic spread is dependent on the detachment and dissemination of cells from a parent tumor, and invasion into the surrounding tissue. In this study, we characterize the kinesin-8 member Kif19 as a promoter of cancer cell invasion that suppresses cell-cell adherens junctions and cell-matrix focal adhesions. Initial analysis of publicly available cancer patient data sets demonstrated that Kif19 expression correlates with worse overall survival probability in several cancers and that Kif19 expression is increased in metastases of colorectal and breast carcinoma compared to the primary tumor. Depletion of Kif19 from two human cancer cell lines (DMS53 and MDA-MB-231) did not alter viability, but decreased the cells ability to invade a Matrigel matrix by half and impaired the invasion of spheroids into a primary cell monolayer. Ectopically expressed Kif19 localized to, and partially depolymerized, microtubules in the cell periphery. However, Kif19 depletion increased microtubule dynamicity and sensitivity to pharmacological depolymerization without altering total microtubule polymer levels. These data indicate that Kif19 can both depolymerize and stabilize microtubules. Given this activity, we then studied Kif19s effect on focal adhesions and adherens junctions, which are both regulated by microtubule dynamics. Kif19 knockdown increased the proportion of cell surface area covered by Vinculin focal adhesions. Further, Kif19 depletion increased whole cell E-cadherin expression and the accumulation of E-cadherin at cell-cell adherens junctions. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of full-length Kif19 led to proportionally smaller focal adhesions and impaired E-cadherin accumulation at cell-cell junctions. Our current hypothesis is that aberrant Kif19 expression in cancer alters focal adhesion dynamics and suppresses E-cadherin expression, which enhance cell invasiveness. Further, we propose that these changes in cell adhesion are due to modification of peripheral microtubule dynamics by Kif19, potentially through disruption of local rho GTPase activity.",

Here we investigate the intermediate formative stage. Using minimal exposure to specification cues, we expand stem cells from formative mouse epiblast. Unlike ES cells or EpiSCs, formative stem (FS) cells respond directly to germ cell induction. They colonise chimaeras including the germline. Transcriptome analyses show retained pre-gastrulation epiblast identity. Gain of signal responsiveness and chromatin accessibility relative to ES cells reflect lineage capacitation. FS cells show distinct transcription factor dependencies from EpiSCs, relying critically on Otx2. Finally, FS cell culture conditions applied to human naive cells or embryos support expansion of similar stem cells, consistent with a conserved attractor state on the trajectory of mammalian pluripotency.",

    "abstract": "In plants, mammals and insects, some genes are methylated in the CG dinucleotide context, a phenomenon called gene body methylation. It has been controversial whether this phenomenon has any functional role. Here, we took advantage of the availability of 876 leaf methylomes in Arabidopsis thaliana to characterize the population frequency of methylation at the gene level and estimated the site-frequency spectrum of allelic states (epialleles). Using a population genetics model specifically designed for epigenetic data, we found that genes with ancestral gene body methylation are under significant selection to remain methylated. Conversely, all genes taken together were inferred to be under selection to be unmethylated. The estimated selection coefficients were small, similar to the magnitude of selection acting on codon usage. We also estimated that A. thaliana is losing gene body methylation three-fold more rapidly than gaining it, which could be due to a recent reduction in the efficacy of selection after a switch to selfing. Finally, we investigated the potential function of gene body methylation through its link with gene expression level. Across genes with polymorphic methylation states, the expression of gene body methylated alleles was consistently and significantly higher than unmethylated alleles. Although it is difficult to disentangle genetic from epigenetic effects, our work suggests that gbM has a small but measurable effect on fitness, perhaps due to its association to a phenotype like gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic chromosomes have phylogenetic persistence. In many taxa, the number of chromosomes is related to the number of centromeres. However, in some groups, such as rhabditid nematodes, centromeric function is distributed across multiple sites on each chromosome. These holocentric chromosomes might, a priori, be expected to be permissive of large-scale chromosomal rearrangement, as chromosomal fragments could still partition correctly and fusions would not generate lethal conflict between multiple centromeres. Here, we explore the phylogenetic stability of nematode chromosomes using a new telomere-to-telomere assembly of the rhabditine nematode Oscheius tipulae generated from nanopore long reads. The 60 Mb O. tipulae genome is resolved into six chromosomal molecules. We find evidence of specific chromatin diminution at all telomeres. Comparing this chromosomal O. tipulae assembly with chromosomal assemblies of diverse rhabditid nematodes we identify seven ancestral chromosomal elements (Nigon elements), and present a model for the evolution of nematode chromosomes through rearrangement and fusion of these elements. We identify frequent fusion events involving NigonX, the element associated with the rhabditid X chromosome, and thus sex-chromosome associated gene sets differ markedly between species. Despite the karyotypic stability, gene order within chromosomes defined by Nigon elements is not conserved. Our model for nematode chromosome evolution provides a platform for investigation of the tensions between local genome rearrangement and karyotypic evolution in generating extant genome architectures.",

    "abstract": "Replication Protein A (RPA) binds to single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and interacts with over three dozen enzymes and serves as a recruitment hub to coordinate most DNA metabolic processes including DNA replication, repair, and recombination. RPA binds ssDNA utilizing six oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide binding (OB) domains within a heterotrimeric complex of RPA70, RPA32 and RPA14 subunits. Based on their DNA binding affinities they are classified as high versus low-affinity DNA binding domains (DBDs). However, recent evidence suggests that the DNA-binding dynamics of DBDs better define their roles. Utilizing hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) we assessed the contacts and dynamics of the individual domains of human RPA to determine the landscape of conformational changes upon binding to ssDNA. As expected, ssDNA interacts with the major DBDs (A, B, C, and D). However, DBD-A and DBD-B are dynamic and do not show robust DNA-dependent protection. DBD-C displays the most extensive changes in HDX, suggesting a major role in stabilizing RPA on ssDNA. DNA-dependent HDX kinetics are also captured for DBD-D and DBD-E. Slower allosteric changes transpire in the protein-protein interaction domains and the linker regions. We propose a dynamics-based DNA binding model for RPA utilizing a dynamic half and a less-dynamic half.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell measurements of cellular characteristics have been instrumental in understanding the heterogeneous pathways that drive differentiation, cellular responses to extracellular signals, and human disease states. scATAC-seq has been particularly challenging due to the large size of the human genome and processing artefacts resulting from DNA damage that are an inherent source of background signal. Downstream analysis and integration of scATAC-seq with other single-cell assays is complicated by the lack of clear phenotypic information linking chromatin state and cell type. Using the heterogeneous mixture of cells in human peripheral blood as a test case, we developed a novel scATAC-seq workflow that increases the signal-to-noise ratio and allows simultaneous measurement of cell surface markers: Integrated Cellular Indexing of Chromatin Landscape and Epitopes (ICICLE-seq). We extended this approach using a droplet-based multiomics platform to develop a trimodal assay to simultaneously measure Transcriptomic state (scRNA-seq), cell surface Epitopes, and chromatin Accessibility (scATAC-seq) from thousands of single cells, which we term TEA-seq. Together, these multimodal single-cell assays provide a novel toolkit to identify type-specific gene regulation and expression grounded in phenotypically defined cell types.",
