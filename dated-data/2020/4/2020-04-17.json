    "abstract": "Bartonellae are Gram-negative facultative-intracellular pathogens that use a type-IV-secretion system (T4SS) to translocate a cocktail of Bartonella effector proteins (Beps) into host cells to modulate diverse cellular functions. BepC was initially reported to act in concert with BepF in triggering major actin cytoskeletal rearrangements that result in the internalization of a large bacterial aggregate by the so-called  invasome. Later, infection studies with bepC deletion mutants and ectopic expression of BepC have implicated this effector in triggering an actin-dependent cell contractility phenotype characterized by fragmentation of migrating cells due to deficient rear detachment at the trailing edge, and BepE was shown to counterbalance this remarkable phenotype. However, the molecular mechanism of how BepC triggers cytoskeletal changes and the host factors involved remained elusive. Using infection assays, we show here that T4SS-mediated transfer of BepC is sufficient to trigger stress fiber formation in non-migrating epithelial cells and additionally cell fragmentation in migrating endothelial cells. Interactomic analysis revealed binding of BepC to a complex of the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 and the serine/threonine-protein kinase MRCK. Knock-out cell lines revealed that only GEF-H1 is required for mediating BepC-triggered stress fiber formation and inhibitor studies implicated activation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway downstream of GEF-H1. Ectopic co-expression of tagged versions of GEF-H1 and BepC truncations revealed that the C-terminal  Bep intracellular delivery (BID) domain facilitated anchorage of BepC to the plasma membrane, whereas the N-terminal  filamentation induced by cAMP (FIC) domain facilitated binding of GEF-H1. While FIC domains typically mediate post-translational modifications, most prominently AMPylation, a mutant with quadruple amino acid exchanges in the putative active site indicated that the BepC FIC domain acts in a non-catalytic manner to activate GEF-H1. Our data support a model in which BepC activates the RhoA/ROCK pathway by re-localization of GEF-H1 from microtubules to the plasma membrane.\n\nAuthor SummaryA wide variety of bacterial pathogens evolved numerous virulence factors to subvert cellular processes in support of a successful infection process. Likewise, bacteria of the genus Bartonella translocate a cocktail of effector proteins (Beps) via a type-IV-secretion system into infected cells in order to interfere with host signaling processes involved in cytoskeletal dynamics, apoptosis control, and innate immune responses. In this study, we demonstrate that BepC triggers actin stress fiber formation and a linked cell fragmentation phenotype resulting from distortion of rear-end retraction during cell migration. The ability of BepC to induce actin stress fiber formation is directly associated with its ability to bind GEF-H1, an activator of the RhoA pathway that is sequestered in an inactive state when bound to microtubules, but becomes activated upon release to the cytoplasm. Our findings suggest that BepC is anchored via its BID domain to the plasma membrane where it recruits GEF-H1 via its FIC domain, eventually activating the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway and leading to stress fiber formation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSEGenetic classifications are crucial for understanding the heterogeneity of glioblastoma. Recently, MR perfusion imaging techniques have demonstrated their ability to determine molecular alterations. In this work, we investigated whether perfusion markers within infiltrated peripheral edema were associated with proneural, mesenchymal, classical and neural subtypes.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODSONCOhabitats open web service was used to obtain the cerebral blood volume at the infiltrated peripheral edema for MRI studies of 50 glioblastoma patients from The Cancer Imaging Archive: TCGA-GBM. ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests were carried out in order to assess the association between vascular features and the subtypes. For assessing specific differences, Mann-Whitney U-test was conducted. Finally, the association of overall survival with molecular and vascular features was assessed using univariate and multivariate Cox models.\n\nRESULTSANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests for the maximum cerebral blood volume at the infiltrated peripheral edema between the four subclasses yielded false discovery rate corrected p-values of <0.001 and 0.02, respectively. This vascular feature was significantly higher (p=0.0043) in proneural patients compared to the rest of the subtypes while conducting Mann-Whitney U-test. The multivariate Cox model pointed to redundant information provided by vascular features at the peripheral edema and proneural subtype when analyzing overall survival.\n\nCONCLUSIONSHigher relative cerebral blood volume at infiltrated peripheral edema is associated with proneural glioblastoma subtype suggesting underlying vascular behavior related to molecular composition in that area.",

    "abstract": "Potato spindle tuber viroid and other pospiviroids can cause serious diseases in potato and tomato crops. Consequently, pospiviroids are regulated in several countries. Since seed transmission is considered as a pathway for the introduction and spread of pospiviroids, some countries demand for the testing of seed lots of solanaceous crops for the presence of pospiviroids. A real-time RT-PCR test, named PospiSense, was developed for testing pepper (Capsicum annuum) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) seeds for seven pospiviroid species known to occur naturally in these crops. The test consists of two multiplex reactions running in parallel, PospiSense 1 and PospiSense 2, that target Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd), Columnea latent viroid (CLVd), pepper chat fruit viroid (PCFVd), potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd), tomato apical stunt viroid (TASVd), tomato chlorotic dwarf viroid (TCDVd) and tomato planta macho viroid (TPMVd, including the former Mexican papita viroid). Dahlia latent viroid (DLVd) is used as an internal isolation control. Validation of the test showed that for both pepper and tomato seeds the current requirements of a routine screening test are fulfilled, i.e. the ability to detect one infested seed in a sample of c.1000 seeds for each of these seven pospiviroids. Additionally, the Pospisense test performed well in an inter-laboratory comparison, which included two routine seed-testing laboratories, and as such provides a relatively easy alternative to the currently used tests.",

    "abstract": "Sex-related differences in cardiovascular diseases are complex and context-dependent. The objective of this work was to comprehensively determine key sex differences in the response to acute and chronic adrenergic stimulation in C57Bl/6 mice. Cardiac function was assessed by trans-thoracic echocardiography before and after acute adrenergic stimulation (a single sub-cutaneous dose of isoproterenol 10 mg/kg) in male and female C57Bl/6 mice. Thereafter, chronic adrenergic stimulation was achieved by sub-cutaneous injections of isoproterenol 10 mg/kg/day for 14 days in male and female mice. Cardiac function and morphometry were assessed by trans-thoracic echocardiography on the 15th day. Thereafter, the mice were euthanized and the hearts were collected. Histopathological analysis of myocardial tissue was performed after staining with hematoxylin & eosin, trichrome, and MAC-2 antibody. Gene expression of remodeling and fibrotic markers was assessed by real-time PCR. Cardiac function and morphometry were also measured before and after isoproterenol 10 mg/kg/day for 14 days in groups of gonadectomized male and female mice and sham-operated controls. In the current work, there were no statistically significant differences in key echocardiographic parameters between male and female C57Bl/6 mice in response to acute adrenergic stimulation. After chronic adrenergic stimulation, there was similar degree of cardiac dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis in male and female mice. Similarly, chronic isoproterenol administration induced hypertrophic and fibrotic genes in hearts of male and female mice to the same extent. Intriguingly, gonadectomy of male and female mice did not have a significant impact on isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction as compared to sham-operated animals. The current work demonstrated lack of significant sex-related differences in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, dysfunction, and fibrosis in C57Bl/6 mice. This study suggests that female sex may not be sufficient to protect the heart against a severe pathologic stimulus and underscores the notion that sexual dimorphism in cardiovascular diseases is highly model-dependent.",

    "abstract": "This study compared force-time characteristics and muscle activity between the isometric squat (ISQ) and mid-thigh pull (IMTP) in both bilateral (ISQBI and IMTPBI) and unilateral (ISQUNI and IMTPUNI) stance. Peak force (PF), rate-of-force (RFD) (e.g. 0-300ms) and EMG of the multifidus, erector spinae (ES), gluteus maximus (GM), biceps femoris (BF), semitendinosus (ST), vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL) and soleus were recorded in ten recreationally trained males. PF was significantly greater during the ISQBI vs. IMTPBI (p=0.016, ES=1.08) but not in the unilateral test mode although effects remained moderate (ES=0.62). A trend indicated heightened RFD300ms (p = 0.083; ES=0.81) during the IMTPBI vs. the ISQBI, but these effects were smaller in the unilateral test (ES = 0.51). Greater (p<0.0001) EMG for VL (ES=1.00-1.13) and VM were recorded during the ISQ compared to IMTP modes in both modes (ES = 0.97 - 1.18). Greater BF EMG (p = 0.030, ES = 0.31) was shown in IMTPBI vs. ISQBI and these effects were stronger in the unilateral modes (p = < 0.05; ES = 0.81 - 0.83). Significantly greater ST activation was shown in both IMTPUNI (p < 0.05; ES = 0.69-0.76) and IMTPBI (p < 0.001; ES = 1.08). These findings indicate that ISQ results in elevated PF, whereas, RFD is heightened during the IMTP and these differences are more pronounced in bilateral modes. Greater activation of the quadriceps and hamstring muscles are expected in ISQ and IMPT respectively.",

    "abstract": "Background To explore the association between the strength of implementation of family planning (FP) programs on the use of modern contraceptives. Specifically, how strongly these programs are being implemented across a health facility\u2019s catchment area in Malawi and the odds of a woman in that catchment area is using modern contraceptives. This information can be used to assess whether the combined impact of multiple large-scale FP programs is leading to change in the health outcomes they aim to improve.Methods and findings We used data from the 2017 Implementation Strength Assessment (ISA) that quantified how much of family planning programs at the health facility and community health worker levels were being implemented across every district of Malawi. We used a summary measure developed in a previous study that employs quantitative methods to combine data across FP domains and health system levels. We tested the association of this summary measure for implementation strength with household data from the 2015 Malawi Demographic Health Survey (DHS). We found that areas with stronger implementation of FP programs had higher odds of women using modern contraceptives compared with areas with weaker implementation. The association of ISA with use of modern contraception was different by education, marital status, and geography. After controlling for these factors, we found that the adjusted odds of using a modern contraceptive was three times higher in catchment areas with high implementation strength compared to those with lower strength.Conclusion Metrics that summarize how strongly FP programs are being implemented were used to show a statistically significantly positive relationship between increasing implementation strength and higher rates of modern contraceptive use. Decisionmakers at the various levels of health authority can use this type of summary measure to better understand the combined impact of their diverse FP programming and inform future programmatic and policy decisions. The findings also reinforce the idea that having a well-supported and supplied cadre of community health workers supplementing FP provision at the health facility can be an important health systems mechanism, especially in rural settings and to target youth populations.View Full Text",
