    "abstract": "Accurate assessment of TCR-antigen specificity at the whole immune repertoire level lies at the heart of improved cancer immunotherapy, but predictive models capable of high-throughput assessment of TCR-peptide pairs are lacking. Recent advances in deep sequencing and crystallography have enriched the data available for studying TCR-p-MHC systems. Here, we introduce a pairwise energy model, RACER, for rapid assessment of TCR-peptide affinity at the immune repertoire level. RACER applies supervised machine learning to efficiently and accurately resolve strong TCR-peptide binding pairs from weak ones. The trained parameters further enable a physical interpretation of interacting patterns encoded in each specific TCR-p-MHC system. When applied to simulate thymic selection of an MHC-restricted T-cell repertoire, RACER accurately estimates recognition rates for tumor-associated neoantigens and foreign peptides, thus demonstrating its utility in helping address the large computational challenge of reliably identifying the properties of tumor antigen-specific T-cells at the level of an individual patients immune repertoire.",

    "abstract": "Ebola virus (EBOV) inclusion bodies (IBs) are cytoplasmic sites of nucleocapsid formation and RNA replication, housing key steps in the virus life cycle that warrant further investigation. During infection IBs display dynamic properties regarding their size and location. Also, the contents of IBs must transition prior to further viral maturation, assembly and release, implying additional steps in IB function. Interestingly, expression of the viral nucleoprotein (NP) alone is sufficient for generation of IBs, indicating that it plays an important role in IB formation during infection. In addition to NP, other components of the nucleocapsid localize to IBs, including VP35, VP24, VP30 and the RNA polymerase L. Previously we defined and solved the crystal structure of the C-terminal domain of NP (NP-Ct), but its role in virus replication remained unclear. Here we show that NP-Ct is absolutely required for IB formation when NP is expressed alone. Interestingly, we find that NP-Ct is also required for production of infectious virus-like particles and retention of viral RNA within these particles. Furthermore, co-expression of the nucleocapsid component VP35 overcomes deletion of NP-Ct in triggering IB formation, demonstrating a functional interaction between the two proteins. Of all the EBOV proteins only VP35 is able to overcome the defect in IB formation caused by deletion of NP-Ct. This effect is mediated by a novel protein-protein interaction between VP35 and NP that controls both regulation of IB formation and RNA replication itself, and which is mediated by a newly identified domain of NP, the \"central domain\" (CD).\n\nImportanceInclusion bodies (IBs) are cytoplasmic sites of RNA synthesis for a variety of negative sense RNA viruses including Ebola virus. In addition to housing important steps in the viral life cycle, IBs protect new viral RNA from innate immune attack and contain specific host proteins whose function is under study. A key viral factor in Ebola virus IB formation is the nucleoprotein, NP, which also is important in RNA encapsidation and synthesis. In this study, we have identified two domains of NP that control inclusion body formation. One of these, the central domain (CD), interacts with viral protein VP35 to control both inclusion body formation and RNA synthesis. The other is the NP C-terminal domain (NP-Ct), whose function has not previously been reported. These findings contribute to a model in which NP and its interactions with VP35 link the establishment of IBs to the synthesis of viral RNA.",

While clinical treatments using SCF would be highly beneficial, these have been limited by toxicity related to mast cell activation.

We created novel therapeutics using tmSCF embedded in proteoliposomes or lipid nanodiscs. Mouse models of anaphylaxis and ischemia revealed the tmSCF-based therapies did not activate mast cells and improved the revascularization in the ischemic hind limb. Proteoliposomal tmSCF preferentially acted on endothelial cells to induce angiogenesis while tmSCF nanodiscs had greater activity in inducing stem cell mobilization and recruitment to the site of injury. The type of lipid nanocarrier used altered the relative cellular uptake pathways and signaling in a cell type dependent manner.

    "abstract": "MotivationDNA metabarcoding is a commonly applied technique used to infer the species composition of environmental samples. These samples can comprise hundreds of organisms that can be closely or very distantly related in the taxonomic tree of life. DNA metabarcoding combines polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-generation sequencing (NGS), whereby a short, homologous sequence of DNA is amplified and sequenced from all members of the community. Sequences are then taxonomically identified based on their match to a reference database. Ideally, each species of interest would have a unique DNA barcode. This short, variable sequence needs to be flanked by relatively conserved regions that can be used as primer binding sites. Appropriate PCR primer pairs would match to a broad evolutionary range of taxa, such that we only need a few to achieve high taxonomic coverage. At the same time however, the DNA barcodes between primer pairs should be different to allow us to distinguish between species to improve resolution. This poses an interesting optimization problem. More specifically: Given a set of references [R] = {R1, R2, ..., Rm}, the problem is to find a primer set P balancing both: high taxonomic coverage and high resolution. This goal can be captured by filtering for frequent primers and ranking by coverage or variation, i.e. the number of unique barcodes. Here we present the software PriSeT, an offline primer discovery tool that is capable of processing large libraries and is robust against mislabeled or low quality references. It tackles the computationally expensive steps with linear runtime filters and efficient encodings.\n\nResultsWe first evaluated PriSeT on references (mostly 18S rRNA genes) from 19 clades covering eukaryotic organisms that are typical for freshwater plankton samples. PriSeT recovered several published primer sets as well as additional, more chemically suitable primer sets. For these new sets, we compared frequency, taxon coverage, and amplicon variation with published primer sets. For 11 clades we found de novo primer pairs that cover more taxa than the published ones, and for six clades de novo primers resulted in greater sequence (i.e., DNA barcode) variation. We also applied PriSeT to 19 SARS-CoV-2 genomes and computed 114 new primer pairs with the additional constraint that the sequences have no co-occurrences in other taxa. These primer sets would be suitable for empirical testing.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/mariehoffmann/PriSeT\n\nContactmarie.hoffmann@fu-berlin.de",

Recent studies suggested prior autonomous selfing mitigate reproductive interference, could enabling coexistence without pollination niche partitioning (pre-emptive selfing hypothesis). However, there are no studies to test whether evolution of prior selfing promote the coexistence, considering eco-evolutionary dynamics of population size, selfing rate and inbreeding depression.\nC_LIO_LITo examine conditions that the evolution of prior selfing promote coexistence under mutual reproductive interference especially in the point of view for pollinator availability and dynamics of inbreeding depression, we constructed individual-based model in which two plant species compete against each other in the form of mutual reproductive interference and can evolve prior autonomous selfing rate. We expected that purging of deleterious mutations could cause evolutionary rescue because inferior species could rescue population density through the evolution of prior selfing if the strength of inbreeding depression decreases with an increase of populations selfing rate.\nC_LIO_LIOur simulation demonstrated that the evolution of prior selfing could promote the coexistence while reproductive interference caused competitive exclusion without evolution. We found that lower pollinator availability tended to prefer rapid evolutionary shift to higher prior selfing rate, it neutralizes the negative effect of reproductive interference, and population dynamics exhibit neutral random walk in both species. When the strength of inbreeding depression decreased with an increase in populations selfing rate, moderate pollinator availability resulted in long-term coexistence in which relative-abundance-dependent selection on the prior selfing rate rescue population density of inferior species intermittently.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis. We showed that the evolution of prior selfing could increase population growth rate of inferior species and consequently enable the long-term coexistence with evolutionary rescue.

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the host component of sepsis has made significant progress. However, detailed study of the microorganisms causing sepsis, either as single pathogens or microbial assemblages, has received far less attention. Metagenomic data offer opportunities to characterise the microbial communities found in septic and healthy individuals. In this study we apply gradient-boosted tree classifiers and a novel computational decontamination technique built upon SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify microbial hallmarks which discriminate blood metagenomic samples of septic patients from that of healthy individuals. Classifiers had high performance when using the read assignments to microbial genera (AUROC = 0.995), including after removal of species  confirmed as the cause of sepsis through clinical testing (AUROC = 0.915). Models trained on single genera were inferior to those employing a polymicrobial model and we identified multiple co-occurring bacterial genera absent from healthy controls.\n\nImportanceWhile prevailing diagnostic paradigms seek to identify single pathogens, our results point to the involvement of a polymicrobial community in sepsis. We demonstrate the importance of the microbial component in characterising sepsis, which may offer new biological insights into the aetiology of sepsis and allow the development of clinical diagnostic or even prognostic tools.",

    "abstract": "The design of novel proteins with specified function and controllable biochemical properties is a longstanding goal in bio-engineering with potential applications across medicine and nanotechnology. The vast expansion of protein sequence databases over the last decades provides an opportunity for new approaches which seek to learn the sequence-function relationship directly from natural sequence variation. Advances in deep generative models have led to the successful modelling of diverse kinds of high-dimensional data, from images to molecules, allowing the generation of novel, realistic samples. While deep models trained on protein sequence data have been shown to learn biologically meaningful representations helpful for a variety of downstream tasks, their potential for direct use in protein engineering remains largely unexplored. Here we show that variational autoencoders trained on a dataset of almost 70000 luciferase-like oxidoreductases can be used to generate novel, functional variants of the luxA bacterial luciferase. We propose separate VAE models to work with aligned sequence input (MSA VAE) and raw sequence input (AR-VAE), and offer evidence that while both are able to reproduce patterns of amino acid usage characteristic of the family, the MSA VAE is better able to capture long-distance dependencies reflecting the influence of 3D structure. To validate the practical utility of the models, we used them to generate variants of luxA whose function was tested experimentally. As further evidence of the practicality of these methods for design, we showed that conditional variants of both models could be used to increase the solubility of luxA without disrupting function. Altogether 18/24 of the variants generated using the AR-VAE and 21/23 variants generated using the MSA VAE retained some luminescence activity, despite containing as many as 35 differences relative to any training set sequence. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep generative models to explore the space of possible protein sequences and generate useful variants, providing a method complementary to rational design and directed evolution approaches.",

    "abstract": "Multisubunit tethering complexes (MTCs) are large (250 to >750 kDa), conserved macromolecular machines that are essential for SNARE-mediated membrane fusion in all eukaryotes. MTCs are thought to function as organizers of membrane trafficking, mediating the initial, long-range interaction between a vesicle and its target membrane and promoting the formation of membrane-bridging SNARE complexes. Previously, we reported the structure of the Dsl1 complex, the simplest known MTC, which is essential for COPI-mediated transport from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This structure suggested how the Dsl1 complex might function to tether a vesicle to its target membrane by binding at one end to the COPI coat and at the other end to ER SNAREs. Here, we use x-ray crystallography to investigate these Dsl1-SNARE interactions in greater detail. The Dsl1 complex comprises three subunits that together form a two-legged structure with a central hinge. Our results show that distal regions of each leg bind N-terminal Habc domains of the ER SNAREs Sec20 (a Qb-SNARE) and Use1 (a Qc-SNARE). The observed binding modes appear to anchor the Dsl1 complex to the ER target membrane while simultaneously ensuring that both SNAREs are in open conformations with their SNARE motifs available for assembly. The proximity of the two SNARE motifs, and therefore their ability to enter the same SNARE complex, depends on the relative orientation of the two Dsl1 legs.",

    "abstract": "Many novel genetic approaches are under development to combat insect pests. One genetic strategy aims to suppress or locally eliminate a species through large, repeated releases of genetically engineered strains that render female offspring unviable under field conditions. Strains with this female-killing (FK) characteristic have been developed either with all of the molecular components in a single construct or with the components in two constructs inserted at independently assorting loci. Strains with two constructs are typically considered to be only of value as research tools and for producing solely male offspring in rearing factories which are subsequently sterilized by radiation before release. A concern with the two-construct strains is that once released, the two constructs would become separated and therefore non-functional. The only FK strains that have been released in the field without sterilization are single-construct strains. Here, we use a population genetics model with density dependence to evaluate the relative effectiveness of female killing approaches based on single- and two-construct arrangements. We find that, in general, the single-construct arrangement results in slightly faster population suppression, but the two-construct arrangement can eventually cause stronger suppression and cause local elimination with a smaller release size. Based on our results, there is no a priori reason that males carrying two independently segregating constructs need to be sterilized prior to release. In some cases, a fertile release would be more efficient for population suppression.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear (nDNA) genes interact to govern metabolic pathways of mitochondria. When differentiated populations interbreed at secondary contact, incompatibilities between mtDNA of one population and nDNA of the other could result in low fitness of hybrids. In northwestern North America, two hybridizing species of warblers, Setophaga occidentalis (abbreviated as SOCC) and S. townsendi (STOW), provide an excellent system to investigate the potential co-adaptation of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA. The inland population of STOW (inland STOW) harbors mtDNA haplotype that is half a million years divergent from the SOCC mtDNA, and these populations also differ strongly in a few nDNA regions. Coastal populations of STOW (coastal STOW) have mixed ancestry, consistent with ancient hybridization of SOCC and inland STOW-like population. Of the few highly-differentiated nDNA regions between inland STOW and SOCC, one of these regions (on chromosome 5) is also differentiated between coastal STOW and inland STOW, and covaries with mtDNA among coastal STOW populations. Genes in this 1.2Mb region of chromosome 5 are associated with fatty acid oxidation and energy-related signaling transduction, both of which are closely associated with mitochondrial function. This chromosome 5 region is correlated with mtDNA haplotypes both within and across sampling sites, a pattern consistent with mitonuclear co-adaptation. We show that such mitonuclear coevolution might be maintained by climate-related selection, because mitonuclear ancestry is correlated with climatic conditions among sampling sites. Together, our observation suggests climatic-associated adaptation shaping mitonuclear differentiation and introgression in this species complex.",

    "abstract": "Numerous gut microbes are associated with insects, but their composition remains largely unknown for many insect groups, along with factors influencing their composition. Here, we compared gut bacterial microbiota of two co-occurring agricultural pests, the peach fruit moth (PFM) and the oriental fruit moth (OFM), collected from different orchards and host plant species. Gut microbiota of both species was mainly composed of bacteria from Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes. The two species shared bacteria from the genera Pseudomonas, Gluconobacter, Acetobacter, and Pantoea, although endosymbiotic Wolbachia was the most abundant genus in PFM and Lactobacillus was the most abundant in OFM. PFM tended to have lower diversity and richness of gut microbiota than OFM; however, only some of the comparisons were statistically significant. Orchards can influence gut microbiota in terms of richness, particularly for PFM, but not so much for diversity parameters.

    "abstract": "Numerous gut microbes are associated with insects, but their composition remains largely unknown for many insect groups, along with factors influencing their composition. Here, we compared gut bacterial microbiota of two co-occurring agricultural pests, the peach fruit moth (PFM) and the oriental fruit moth (OFM), collected from different orchards and host plant species. Gut microbiota of both species was mainly composed of bacteria from Proteobacteria, followed by Firmicutes. The two species shared bacteria from the genera Pseudomonas, Gluconobacter, Acetobacter, and Pantoea, although endosymbiotic Wolbachia was the most abundant genus in PFM and Lactobacillus was the most abundant in OFM. PFM tended to have lower diversity and richness of gut microbiota than OFM; however, only some of the comparisons were statistically significant. Orchards can influence gut microbiota in terms of richness, particularly for PFM, but not so much for diversity parameters. Functional prediction of gut microbiota showed that the top pathways are amino acid metabolism, translation, and membrane transport in both species, but their abundance varied between the two moth species.

    "abstract": "Dendrites shape information flow in neurons. Yet, there is little consensus on the level of spatial complexity at which they operate. We present a flexible and fast method to obtain simplified neuron models at any level of complexity. Through carefully chosen parameter fits, solvable in the least squares sense, we obtain optimal reduced compartmental models. We show that (back-propagating) action potentials, calcium-spikes and NMDA-spikes can all be reproduced with few compartments. We also investigate whether afferent spatial connectivity motifs admit simplification by ablating targeted branches and grouping the affected synapses onto the next proximal dendrite. We find that voltage in the remaining branches is reproduced if temporal conductance fluctuations stay below a limit that depends on the average difference in input impedance between the ablated branches and the next proximal dendrite. Further, our methodology fits reduced models directly from experimental data, without requiring morphological reconstructions. We provide a software toolbox that automatizes the simplification, eliminating a common hurdle towards including dendritic computations in network models.",

    "abstract": "Making predictions about future rewards or punishments is fundamental to adaptive behavior. These processes are influenced by prior experience. For example, prior exposure to aversive stimuli or stressors changes behavioral responses to negative- and positive-value predictive cues. Here, we demonstrate a role for medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons projecting to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT; mPFC[-&gt;]PVT) in this process. We found that a history of punishments negatively biased behavioral responses to motivationally-relevant stimuli in mice and that this negative bias was associated with hyperactivity in mPFC[-&gt;]PVT neurons during exposure to those cues. Furthermore, artificially mimicking this hyperactive response with selective optogenetic excitation of the same pathway recapitulated the punishmentinduced negative behavioral bias. Together, our results highlight how information flow within the mPFC[-&gt;]PVT circuit is critical for making predictions about imminent motivationally-relevant outcomes as a function of prior experience.",

    "abstract": "Rewarding choice options typically contain multiple components, but neural signals in single brain voxels are scalar and primarily vary up or down. In a previous study, we had designed reward bundles that contained the same two milkshakes with independently set amounts; we had used psychophysics and rigorous economic concepts to estimate two-dimensional choice indifference curves (IC) that represented revealed stochastic preferences for these bundles in a systematic, integrated manner. All bundles on the same ICs were equally revealed preferred (and thus had same utility, as inferred from choice indifference); bundles on higher ICs (higher utility) were preferred to bundles on lower ICs (lower utility). In the current study, we used the established behavior for testing with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We now demonstrate neural responses in reward-related brain structures of human female and male participants, including striatum, midbrain and medial orbitofrontal cortex that followed the characteristic pattern of ICs: similar responses along ICs (same utility despite different bundle composition), but monotonic change across ICs (different utility). Thus, these brain structures integrated multiple reward components into a scalar signal, well beyond the known subjective value coding of single-component rewards.\n\nSignificance StatementRewards have several components, like the taste and size of an apple, but it is unclear how each component contributes to the overall value of the reward. While choice indifference curves of economic theory provide behavioural approaches to this question, it is unclear whether brain responses capture the preference and utility integrated from multiple components. We report activations in striatum, midbrain and orbitofrontal cortex that follow choice indifference curves representing behavioral preferences over and above variations of individual reward components. In addition, the concept-driven approach encourages future studies on natural, multi-component rewards that are prone to irrational choice of normal and brain-damaged individuals.",

    "abstract": "Parkinson disease is characterized by loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. As with other neurodegenerative diseases, no disease-modifying treatments exist. While most treatment objectives aim to prevent neuronal loss or protect vulnerable neuronal circuits, an important alternative is to replace lost neurons to reconstruct disrupted circuits. Herein we report an efficient single-step conversion of isolated mouse and human astrocytes into functional neurons by depleting the RNA binding protein PTB. Applying this approach to mice with a chemically induced Parkinsons phenotype, we provide evidence that disease manifestations can be potently reversed through converting astrocytes into new substantia nigral neurons, effectively restoring dopamine levels via reestablishing the nigrostriatal dopamine pathway. We further demonstrate similar disease reversal with a therapeutically feasible approach using antisense oligonucleotides to transiently suppress PTB. These findings identify a generalizable therapeutic strategy for treating neurodegenerative disorders through replacing lost neurons in the brain.",

    "abstract": "ContextThe trend to delay pregnancy in the United States has resulted in the number of advanced maternal age (AMA) pregnancies to also increase. In humans, AMA is associated with a variety of pregnancy-related pathologies such as preeclampsia (PE). While AMA is known to be a factor which contributes to the development of pregnancy-induced diseases, the molecular and cellular mechanisms giving rise to this phenomenon are still very limited. This is due in part to lack of a pre-clinical model which has physiologic relevance to human pregnancy while also allowing control of environmental and genetic variability inherent in human studies.\n\nObjectiveTo determine potential physiologic relevance of the vervet/African green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) as a pre-clinical model to study the effects of AMA on adaptations to pregnancy.\n\nDesignThirteen age-diverse pregnant vervet monkeys (3-16 y.o.) were utilized to measure third trimester blood pressure (BP), complete blood count, iron measurements and hormone levels.\n\nResultsSignificant associations were observed between third trimester diastolic BP and maternal age. Furthermore, the presence of leukocytosis with enhanced circulating neutrophils was observed in AMA mothers compared to younger mothers. Moreover, we observed a negative relationship between maternal age and estradiol, progesterone and cortisol levels. Finally, offspring born to AMA mothers displayed a postnatal growth retardation phenotype.\n\nConclusionsThese studies demonstrate physiologic impairment in the adaptation to pregnancy in AMA vervet/African green monkeys. Our data indicate the vervet/African green monkey may serve as a useful pre-clinical model and tool for deciphering pathological mediators of maternal disease in AMA pregnancy.",

Optimizing both light interception and radiation use efficiency of agricultural crop canopies will be essential to meeting growing needs for food. Canopy architecture is inherently 3D, but many approaches to measuring canopy architecture component traits treat the canopy as a two dimensional structure in order to make large scale measurement, selective breeding, and gene identification logistically feasible. We develop a high throughput voxel carving strategy to reconstruct three dimensional representations of maize and sorghum from a small number of RGB photos. This approach was employed to generate three dimensional reconstructions of a sorghum association population at the late vegetative stage of development. Light interception parameters estimated from these reconstructions enabled the identification of both known and previously unreported loci controlling light interception efficiency in sorghum. The approach described here is generalizable and scalable and it enables 3D reconstructions from existing plant high throughput phenotyping datasets. For future datasets we propose a set of best practices to increase the accuracy of three dimensional reconstructions.",

    "abstract": "Biologics such as peptides and antibodies are a well-established class of therapeutics. However, their intracellular delivery remains problematic. In particular, methods to efficiently inhibit intra-nuclear targets are lacking. We previously described that Pseudomonas Exotoxin A reaches the nucleoplasm via the endosomes-to-nucleus trafficking pathway. Here, we show that a non-toxic truncated form of PE can be coupled to peptides and efficiently reach the nucleoplasm. It can be used as a Peptide Nuclear Delivery Device (PNDD) to deliver polypeptidic cargos as large as Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) to the nucleus. PNDD1 is a fusion of PNDD to the c-myc inhibitor peptide H1. PNDD1 is able to inhibit c-Myc dependent transcription at nanomolar concentration. In contrast, H1 fused to various cell-penetrating peptides are active only in the micromolar range. PNDD1 attenuates cell proliferation and induces cell death in various tumor cell lines. In particular, several patient-derived Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas cell lines die after exposure to PNDD1, while normal B-cells survive. Altogether, our data indicate that PNDD is a powerful tool to bring active cargo to the nucleus and PNDD1 could be the basis of a new therapy against lymphoma.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian embryogenesis is a complex process controlled by transcription factors that dynamically regulate the balance between pluripotency and differentiation. Transcription factor AhR is known to regulate Oct4/Pou5f1 and Nanog, both essential genes in pluripotency, stemness and early embryo development. Yet, the molecular mechanisms controlling Oct4/Pou5f1 and Nanog during embryo development remain largely unidentified. Here, we show that AhR is required for proper embryo differentiation by regulating pluripotency factors and by maintaining adequate metabolic activity. AhR lacking embryos (AhR-/-) showed a more pluripotent phenotype characterized by a delayed expression of differentiation markers of the first and second cell divisions. Accordingly, central pluripotency factors OCT4/POU5F1, NANOG, and SOX2 were overexpressed in AhR-/- embryos at initial developmental stages. An altered intracellular localization of these factors was observed in absence of AhR and, importantly, OCT4 had an opposite expression pattern with respect to AhR from the 2-cell stage to blastocyst, suggesting a negative regulatory mechanism of OCT4/POU5F by AhR. Hippo signalling, rather than being repressed, was upregulated in very early AhR-/- embryos, possibly contributing to their undifferentiation at later stages. Consistently, AhR-null blastocysts overexpressed the early marker of inner cell mass (ICM) differentiation Sox17 whereas downregulated extraembryonic differentiation-driving genes Cdx2 and Gata3. Moreover, the persistent pluripotent phenotype of AhR-/- embryos was supported by an enhanced glycolytic metabolism and a reduction in mitochondrial activity. We propose that AhR is a regulator of pluripotency and differentiation in early mouse embryogenesis and that its deficiency may underline the reduced viability and increased resorptions of AhR-null mice.",

    "abstract": "Vitellogenesis, including vitellogenin (Vg) production in the fat body and Vg uptake by maturing oocytes, is of great importance for the successful reproduction of adult females. The endocrinal and nutritional regulation of vitellogenesis differs distinctly in insects. Here, the complex crosstalk between juvenile hormone (JH) and the two nutrient sensors, insulin/IGF signaling (IIS) and target of rapamycin (TOR), was investigated to elucidate the molecular mechanisms regulating vitellogenesis in the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana. Our data showed that a block of JH biosynthesis or JH action arrested vitellogenesis, partially by inhibiting the expression of doublesex (Dsx), a key transcription factor gene involved in the sex determination cascade. Depletion of IIS and TOR blocked both JH biosynthesis and vitellogenesis. Importantly, the JH analog methoprene, but not bovine insulin (to restore IIS) and amino acids (to restore TOR activity), restored vitellogenesis in the neck-ligated (both nutrient- and JH-deficient) cockroaches. Combining classic physiology with modern molecular techniques, we have demonstrated that JH signaling alone is able to induce vitellogenesis and thus ovarian maturation. By contrast, IIS and TOR do not induce vitellogenesis independent of JH, the nutrient sensors promote vitellogenesis in an indirect manner via activating JH biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "PurposeNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), affected more than 70 % of patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), has become a common metabolic liver disease worldwide. However, the specifically treatments targeting NAFLD have not been found until now. Pulsed electromagnetic fields have positive effects on multiple diseases. However, the effects of PEMF on NAFLD in T2DM require further investigation. The present study assessed the effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields on the liver oxidative stress and lipid accumulation of db/db mice.\n\nPatients and methodsAnimals were exposed to 2 h of pulsed electromagnetic fields (15.38 Hz, 2 mT) or sham stimulated, and thereafter sacrificed at 8 weeks later. The biomarkers of oxidative stress, such as MDA, GSSG and GSH levels, were analysed with commercial kits. The activity of liver antioxidant enzymes as CAT, SOD and GSH-Px was detected. Hepatic expressions of CAT, GR, GSH-Px, SOD1, SOD2 and SREBP-1c at protein levels were determined with Western blotting. Hepatic weight was measured and triglyceride accumulation were visualized by Oil Red O staining.\n\nResultsPEMF exposure could protect the liver from oxidative stress injury by decreasing MDA and GSSG level, promoting reduced GSH level, and increasing GSH-Px activity and expression in comparison with sham group. But CAT and SOD activity have no statistic difference as same as CAT, GR, SOD1 and SOD2 expression. Furthermore, PEMF exposure reduced liver weight and triglyceride content. Meanwhile, PEMF exposure ameliorated hepatic steatosis through reducing the expression of SREBP-1c to regulate the lipid synthesis.\n\nConclusionThe present study provides evidence that PEMF could increase antioxidant enzymes activity and alleviate lipid accumulation in fatty liver. This implies that PEMF exposure has beneficial effects for the treatment of NAFLD in accompany with T2DM.",

    "abstract": "Chronically-implanted neural microelectrodes are powerful tools for neuroscience research and emerging clinical applications, but their usefulness is limited by their tendency to fail after months in vivo. One failure mode is the degradation of insulation materials that protect the conductive traces from the saline environment. Studies have shown that material degradation is accelerated by mechanical stresses, which tend to concentrate on raised topographies such as conducting traces. Therefore, to avoid raised topographies, we developed a fabrication technique that recesses (buries) the traces in dry-etched, self-aligned trenches. The depth of the trenches and the thickness of the traces are matched so that overlying insulation materials are flat, which, according to finite-element modeling, reduces stress concentrations in the insulation material. Here, we provide details on process optimization, modeling of intrinsic stress, and characterization using SEM, focused ion-beam cross sections, profilometry, and electrochemical impedance testing. The technique requires no extra masks, is easy to integrate with existing processes, and produces flatness within about 10 nm.",

    "abstract": "Coevolutionary negative frequency dependent selection has been hypothesized to maintain genetic variation in host and parasites. Despite the extensive literature pertaining to host-parasite coevolution, the effect of matching-alleles (MAM) coevolution on the maintenance of genetic variation has not been explicitly modelled in a finite population. The dynamics of the MAM in an infinite population, in fact, suggests that genetic variation in these coevolving populations behaves neutrally. We find that while this is largely true in finite populations two additional phenomena arise. The first of these effects is that of coevolutionary natural selection on stochastic perturbations in host and pathogen allele frequencies. While this may increase or decrease genetic variation, depending on the parameter conditions, the net effect is small relative to that of the second phenomena. Following fixation in the pathogen, the MAM becomes one of directional selection, which in turn rapidly erodes genetic variation in the host. Hence, rather than maintain it, we find that, on average, matching-alleles coevolution depletes genetic variation.",

    "abstract": "Cave sets the example of extreme ecological niche and habitat for diversified microorganisms. Present study involved in the isolation of endoxylanase producing novel strain Bacillus velezensis AG20 from the Krem Phyllut cave, Meghalaya, India. Culture dependent studies, molecular phylogentics, RNA secondary folding pattern based on 16S rDNA substantiated the identity of this novel strain. Bacillus velezensis AG20 revealed the superbug quality having resistance against various class of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Bacillus velezensis AG20 revealed biofilm formation over the cell surface in FESEM. Highest cell biomass and xylanase production supported in TB medium, further purified partially to 5.3 fold with 21% yield. Molecular weight of the purified xylanase found to be 45 kDa. Enzyme kinetics and pattern of hydrolysis revealed the evidence for the selection of linear birchwood xylan with Vmax = 21.0 {+/-} 3.0 U/ml, Km = 1.25 mg/ml, Kcat = 1.75/s at optimum pH 7 and temperature 50{degrees}C also found significant statistically in Taguchis orthogonal design. Conversely, ruled out any exoacting activity against synthetic pNP-xylopyranoside substrate. Endo-xylanase isolated from Bacillus velezensis AG20 was moderately thermostable over temperatures 50 and 60{degrees}C. Time dependent hydrolysis of agro-waste sugar cane bagasse depicted the production of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) predominantly xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetrose. Purified mixed XOS hold their prebiotic potential by promoting the growth of probiotics Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus as well as high stability (~90%) against systemic fluids. Mixed XOS (300 g/ml) displayed anti-proliferation activities by reducing the growth of HT-29 and Caco-2 cells significantly 90% and 75%, respectively, after 48 h.\n\nIMPORTANCEExtremophiles dwelling inside the caves have laden with the extraordinary capabilities of bioconversion by nature. The pristine ecological niche inside the cave, absence of proper light and air, supports the livelihood of novel microorganisms. In India, Meghalaya is hoisting longest caves in the East Khasi Hills, providing conducive environment for novel bacterial strains. With the prime objective of isolating novel bacterial strains that produce extracellular xylanase our studies have been carried out. Considering the present industrial demand for nutraceutical, prebiotics, anti-proliferating agents and biofuels by the conversion of lignocellulosic biomass (LCB), novel enzymes are required. Xylanases from bacterial origin play a significant role in conversion of LCB into oligosaccharides. Therefore, exploration and characterization of xylanase producing novel isolate from cave may pave the new arena for the production of prebiotic and anti-inflammatory oligosaccharides from agro-waste.",

It has a unique combination of a kinase domain at N-terminus and a WD40 type domain at C-terminus joined through a linker. WD40 domain is comprised of eight {beta} propeller repeats held together via \"tryptophan-docking motifs\" and forming a typical  velcro closure structure. RqkA mutants lacking the WD40 region (hereafter referred to as WD mutant) could not complement RqkA loss in {gamma} radiation resistance in D. radiodurans and lacked {gamma} radiation mediated activation of kinase activity in vivo. WD mutants failed to phosphorylate its cognate substrate (e.g. DrRecA) in surrogate E. coli cells. Further, unlike wild type enzyme, the kinase activity of its WD40 mutants was not stimulated by Pyrroloquinoline quinine (PQQ) indicating the role of the WD motifs in PQQ interaction and stimulation of its kinase activity. Together, results highlighted the importance of the WD40 domain in the regulation of RqkA kinase signaling functions in vivo and thus the role of WD40 domain in the regulation of any STPK is the first time demonstrated in bacteria.\n\nImportanceThis study highlights the importance of the WD40 domain in activity regulation and signaling activity of bacterial serine/ threonine kinase for the first time in the bacterial response to gamma radiation and DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "The firing pattern of ventral midbrain dopamine neurons is controlled by afferent and intrinsic activity to generate prediction error signals that are essential for reward-based learning. Given the absence of intracellular in vivo recordings in the last three decades, the subthreshold membrane potential events that cause changes in dopamine neuron firing patterns remain unknown. By establishing stable in vivo whole-cell recordings of >100 spontaneously active midbrain dopamine neurons in anaesthetized mice, we identified the repertoire of subthreshold membrane potential signatures associated with distinct in vivo firing patterns. We demonstrate that dopamine neuron in vivo activity deviates from a single spike pacemaker pattern by eliciting transient increases in firing rate generated by at least two diametrically opposing biophysical mechanisms: a transient depolarization resulting in high frequency plateau bursts associated with a reactive, depolarizing shift in action potential threshold; and a prolonged hyperpolarization preceding slower rebound bursts characterized by a predictive, hyperpolarizing shift in action potential threshold. Our findings therefore illustrate a framework for the biophysical implementation of prediction error and sensory cue coding in dopamine neurons by tuning action potential threshold dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Severe asthma is a chronic airway disease that exhibits poor response to conventional asthma therapies. Growing evidence suggests that elevated hypoxia increases the severity of asthmatic inflammation among patients and in model systems. In this study, we elucidate the therapeutic effects and mechanistic basis of Adhatoda Vasica (AV) aqueous extract on mouse models of acute allergic as well as severe asthma subtypes at physiological, histopathological, and molecular levels. Oral administration of AV extract attenuates the increased airway resistance and inflammation in acute allergic asthmatic mice and alleviates the molecular signatures of steroid (dexamethasone) resistance like IL-17A, KC, and HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor-1alpha) in severe asthmatic mice. AV inhibits HIF-1 levels through restoration of expression of its negative regulator-PHD2 (prolyl hydroxylase domain-2). Alleviation of hypoxic response mediated by AV is further confirmed in the acute and severe asthma model. AV reverses cellular hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in human bronchial epithelial cells - evident from bioenergetic profiles and morphological analysis of mitochondria. In silico docking of AV constituents reveal higher negative binding affinity for C and O-glycosides for HIF-1, IL-6, Janus kinase 1/3, TNF- and TGF-{beta}-key players of hypoxia-inflammation. This study for the first time provides a molecular basis of action and effect of AV whole extract that is widely used in Ayurveda practice for diverse respiratory ailments. Further, through its effect on hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, the study highlights its potential to treat severe steroid-resistant asthma.\n\nSignificance StatementSevere asthma is a global health concern with a large fraction unresponsive to current treatment modalities involving corticosteroids. Recent findings suggest that elevated hypoxia has a critical role in severity of asthma. Here, we report therapeutic treatment with aqueous extract of Adhatoda Vasica (AV), an ayurvedic medicine, attenuates sever steroid insensitive asthmatic features in mice. The observed effects of AV are through inhibition of hypoxic response, both in vivo and in vitro. AV also reverses mitochondrial dysfunction, a key consequence associated with hypoxia, and asthma. This study highlights the translational potential of AV for the treatment of severe asthma and provides opportunities for its usage in other disease conditions where hypoxia is pertinent.",

We investigate a fully plastic spiking network of the primary visual cortex, building on phenomenological plasticity rules. Our results suggest that inhibitory plasticity is key to the emergence of tuning diversity and accurate input encoding. We show that inhibitory feedback (random and specific) increases the metabolic efficiency by implementing a gain control mechanism.

Our results highlight the essential role of residues near the N-terminal part of coiled-coil regions, possibly critical for superhelix assembly and folding in some cases. We also show that coiled-coils of different oligomerization states exhibit characteristically distinct patterns of disease-causing mutations. Our study provides structural and functional explanations on how disease emerges through the mutation of these structural motifs.",

    "abstract": "In terrestrial animals, lacrimal drainage apparatus evolved to serve as conduits for tear flow. Little is known about the ontogenesis of this system. Here, we investigated tear duct origin, developmental course, genetic and cellular determinants in mouse. We report that primordial tear duct (PTD) originates from junction epithelium of the joining maxillary and lateral nasal processes, which reshapes into future tear duct branches. We identified Prickle 1 as a hallmark for tear duct outgrowth, ablation of which stalled duct elongation. In particular, the disruption of basement membrane (BM) with cytoplasmic accumulation of laminin suggests aberrant protein trafficking. Mutant embryoid bodies (EBs) derived from iPSCs recapitulate BM phenotype of the PTD exhibiting defective visceral endoderm (VE), which normally expresses high level of Prickle 1. Furthermore, replenishing mutant VE with Prickle 1 completely rescued BM but not cell polarity. Taken together, our results reveal a distinct role of Prickle 1 in regulating polarized BM secretion and deposition in precedently uncharacterized tear drainage system and VE, which is independent of apicobasal polarity establishment.",

    "abstract": "MiDAC is a recently identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) complex. While other HDAC complexes have been implicated in neurogenesis, the physiological role of MiDAC remains unknown. Here, we show that MiDAC constitutes an important regulator of neural differentiation. We demonstrate that MiDAC functions as a modulator of a neurodevelopmental gene expression program and binds to important regulators of neurite outgrowth. On the one hand, MiDAC upregulates gene expression by mediating the removal of H4K20ac on the promoters and enhancers of pro-neural genes such as those encoding the secreted ligands SLIT3 and NETRIN1 (NTN1). Conversely, MiDAC inhibits gene expression by reducing H3K27ac on promoter-proximal and -distal elements of negative regulators of neurogenesis. Furthermore, loss of MiDAC results in neurite outgrowth defects that can be rescued by supplementation with SLIT3 and/or NTN1. These findings indicate a crucial role for MiDAC in regulating the ligands of the SLIT3 and NTN1 signaling axes to ensure the proper integrity of neurite development.",

How the interaction between the two organelles contributes the generation of heat remains elusive. Here we report that LD-anchored mitochondria (LDAM) were observed in BAT of mice raised at three different temperatures, 30{degrees}C, 23{degrees}C, and 6{degrees}C. The biochemical analyses including Western blotting and electron transport chain subunits showed that LDAM were functional at given temperatures. Comparative proteomics analysis was conducted and revealed that these LDAM had protein level differences from cytoplasmic mitochondria (CM) at different temperatures. Higher expressions of proteins at low temperature were observed for i) FA {beta}-oxidation in LDAM including FA synthesis, and uncoupling, ii) pseudo-futile cycle in CM, and iii) two shuttle systems; glycerol 3-phosphate in both CM and LDAM, and citrate malate in CM. Together, these results suggest that LDs and LDAM are a preorganized and functional organelle complex that permits the rapid response to cold environment.",

    "abstract": "Neurons must establish and stabilize connections made with diverse targets, each with distinct demands and functional characteristics. At Drosophila neuromuscular junctions, synaptic strength remains stable in a manipulation that simultaneously induces hypo-innervation on one target and hyper-innervation on the other. However, the expression mechanisms that achieve this exquisite target-specific homeostatic control remain enigmatic. Here, we identify the distinct target-specific homeostatic expression mechanisms. On the hypo-innervated target, an increase in postsynaptic glutamate receptor (GluR) abundance is sufficient to compensate for reduced innervation, without any apparent presynaptic adaptations. In contrast, a target-specific reduction in presynaptic neurotransmitter release probability is reflected by a decrease in active zone components restricted to terminals of hyper-innervated targets. Finally, loss of postsynaptic GluRs on one target induces a compartmentalized, homeostatic enhancement of presynaptic neurotransmitter release called presynaptic homeostatic potentiation that can be precisely balanced with the adaptations required for both hypo- and hyper-innervation to maintain stable synaptic strength. Thus, distinct anterograde and retrograde signaling systems operate at pre- and post-synaptic compartments to enable target-specific, homeostatic control of neurotransmission.",

    "abstract": "Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are receptor proteins that are sensitive to their membrane environment, but the mechanism for how lipids modulate function under physiological conditions in a state dependent manner is not known. The glycine receptor is a pLGIC whose structure has been resolved in different functional states. Using a realistic model of a neuronal membrane coupled with coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the lipid-protein interactions are dependent on the receptor state, suggesting that lipids may regulate the receptors conformational dynamics. Comparison with existing structural data confirms known lipid binding sites, but we also predict further protein-lipid interactions including a site at the communication interface between the extracellular and transmembrane domain. Moreover, in the active state, cholesterol can bind to the binding site of the positive allosteric modulator ivermectin. These protein-lipid interaction sites could in future be exploited for the rational design of lipid-like allosteric drugs.\n\nAuthor SummaryIon channels are proteins that control the flow of ions into the cell. The family of ion channels known as the pentameric ligand gated ion channels (pLGICS) open in response to the binding of a neurotransmitter, moving the channel from a resting state to an open state. The glycine receptor is a pLGIC whose structure has been resolved in different functional states. It is also known that the response of pLGICs can also be modified by different types of lipid found within the membrane itself but exactly how is unclear. Here, we used a realistic model of a neuronal membrane and performed molecular dynamics simulations to show various lipid-protein interactions that are dependent on the channel state. Our work also reveals previously unconsidered protein-lipid interactions at a key junction of the channel known to be critical for the transmission of the opening process. We also demonstrate that cholesterol interacts with the protein at a site already known to bind to another compound that modulates the channel, called ivermectin. The work should be useful for future drug design.",

    "abstract": "Lower-limb wearable robotic devices can provide effective assistance to both clinical and healthy populations; however, how assistance should be applied in different gait conditions and environments is still unclear. We suggest a biologically-inspired approach derived from knowledge of human locomotion mechanics and energetics to establish a  roadmap for wearable robot design. In this study, we characterize the changes in joint mechanics during both walking and running across a range of incline/decline grades and then provide an analysis that informs the development of lower-limb exoskeletons capable of operating across a range of mechanical demands. Eight subjects (6M,2F) completed five walking (1.25 m -1) trials at -15%, -10%, 0%, 10%, and 15% grade and five running (2.25 m s-1) trials at -10%, -5%, 0%, 5%, and 10% grade on a treadmill. We calculated time-varying joint moment and power output for the ankle, knee, and hip. For each gait, we examined how individual limb-joints contributed to total limb positive, negative and net power across grades. For both walking and running, changes in grade caused a redistribution of joint mechanical power generation and absorption. From level to incline walking, the ankles contribution to limb positive power decreased from 44% on the level to 28% at 15% uphill grade (p < 0.0001) while the hips contribution increased from 27% to 52% (p < 0.0001). In running, regardless of the surface gradient, the ankle was consistently the dominant source of lower-limb positive mechanical power (47-55%). In the context of our results, we outline three distinct use-modes that could be emphasized in future lower-limb exoskeleton designs 1) Energy injection: adding positive work into the gait cycle, 2) Energy extraction: removing negative work from the gait cycle, and 3) Energy transfer: extracting energy in one gait phase and then injecting it in another phase (i.e., regenerative braking).",

    "abstract": "Current practice of assessing mood episodes in affective disorders largely depends on subjective observations combined with semi-structured clinical rating scales. Motor activity is an objective observation of the inner physiological state expressed in behavior patterns. Alterations of motor activity are essential features of bipolar and unipolar depression. The aim was to investigate if objective measures of motor activity can aid existing diagnostic practice, by applying machine-learning techniques to analyze activity patterns in depressed patients and healthy controls. Random Forrest, Deep Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network algorithms were used to analyze 14 days of actigraph recorded motor activity from 23 depressed patients and 32 healthy controls. Statistical features analyzed in the dataset were mean activity, standard deviation of mean activity and proportion of zero activity. Various techniques to handle data imbalance were applied, and to ensure generalizability and avoid overfitting a Leave-One-User-Out validation strategy was utilized. All outcomes reports as measures of accuracy for binary tests. A Deep Neural Network combined with random oversampling class balancing technique performed a cut above the rest with a true positive rate of 0.82 (sensitivity) and a true negative rate of 0.84 (specificity). Accuracy was 0.84 and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient 0.65. Misclassifications appear related to data overlapping among the classes, so an appropriate future approach will be to compare mood states intra-individualistic. In summary, machine-learning techniques present promising abilities in discriminating between depressed patients and healthy controls in motor activity time series.",

    "abstract": "Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), or internal feelings of reduced mental capacity, is of increasing interest in the scientific, clinical, and lay community. Much of the extant literature is focused on SCD as a risk factor for Alzheimers disease in older adults, while less attention has been paid to non-cognitive health correlates of SCD across adulthood. Consequently, we investigated physical and mental health correlates of SCD in younger, middle-aged, and older adults. We recruited 3,407 U.S. residents through Amazons Mechanical Turk, an online labor market. Participants completed a 90-item self-report survey questionnaire assessing sociodemographic characteristics, physical health, sleep, depression, anxiety, loneliness, wisdom, self-efficacy, and happiness. Overall, 493/1930 (25.5%) of younger adults (18-49) and 278/1032 (26.9%) of older adults (50 or older) endorsed the SCD item. Multivariate analysis of variance and follow-up t-tests revealed worse physical and mental health characteristics in people endorsing SCD compared to those who did not, with effect sizes primarily in the medium to large range. Additionally, age did not moderate relationships between SCD and physical and mental health. Results suggest that SCD is associated with a diverse set of negative health characteristics such as poor sleep and high body mass index, and lower levels of positive factors including happiness and wisdom. Effect sizes of psychological correlates of SCD were as large as (or larger than) those of physical correlates, indicating that mental health and affective symptoms may be critical to consider when evaluating SCD. Overall, findings from this large, national U.S. sample suggest the presence of relationships between SCD and multiple psychological and perceived health factors; our results also show that SCD may be highly prevalent in both younger and older adults, suggesting that it be assessed across the adult lifespan.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOver the past 20 years there has been a >95% reduction in the number of Gambian Human African trypanosomiasis (g-HAT) cases reported globally, largely as a result of large-scale active screening and treatment programmes. There are however still foci where the disease persists, particularly in parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Additional control efforts such as tsetse control using Tiny Targets may therefore be required to achieve g-HAT elimination goals. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of Tiny Targets within DRC.\n\nMethodology/Principal findingsIn 2015-2017, pre- and post-intervention tsetse abundance data were collected from 1,234 unique locations across three neighbouring Health Zones (Yasa Bonga, Mosango, Masi Manimba). Remotely sensed dry season data were combined with pre-intervention tsetse presence/absence data from 332 locations within a species distribution modelling framework to produce a habitat suitability map. The impact of Tiny Targets on the tsetse population was then evaluated by fitting a generalised linear mixed model to the relative fly abundance data collected from 889 post-intervention monitoring sites within Yasa Bonga, with habitat suitability, proximity to the intervention and intervention duration as covariates. Immediately following the introduction of the intervention, we observe a dramatic reduction in fly catches by > 85% (pre-intervention: 0.78 flies/trap/day, 95% CI 0.676-0.900; 3 month post-intervention: 0.11 flies/trap/day, 95% CI 0.070-0.153) which is sustained throughout the study period. Declines in catches were negatively associated with proximity to Tiny Targets, and while habitat suitability is positively associated with abundance its influence is reduced in the presence of the intervention.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThis study adds to the body of evidence demonstrating the impact of Tiny Targets on tsetse across a range of ecological settings, and further characterises the factors which modify its impact. The habitat suitability maps have the potential to guide the expansion of tsetse control activities in this area.\n\nAuthors SummaryThere have been large declines in the number of cases of sleeping sickness as a result of programmes that actively screen and treat the at-risk population. Additional control is needed in areas where the disease persists such as parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The disease is transmitted by tsetse flies, and reducing the tsetse population using Tiny Targets has been shown to control the disease in other countries. Extensive tsetse monitoring has been undertaken in one Health Zone in DRC where Tiny Targets have been deployed. We used these data to gain a better understanding of tsetse habitat, to produce habitat suitability maps, and to subsequently measure the impact of Tiny Targets on the tsetse population. We show that tsetse flies are largely found along rivers and surrounding densely vegetated habitat, with there being a positive relationship between habitat suitability and the number of flies caught. Once Tiny Targets were introduced, the number of flies caught in monitoring traps decreased by >85%, with habitat suitability at the trap location, and the proximity of the trap to the nearest Tiny Target influencing the size of the effect of the intervention. This study adds to the body of evidence demonstrating the impact of Tiny Targets on tsetse distribution in addition to providing information that can be used to guide the expansion of tsetse control activities in this area.",

    "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including the more recently identified Stable Unannotated Transcripts (SUTs) and Cryptic Unstable Transcripts (CUTs), are increasingly being shown to play pivotal roles in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of genes in eukaryotes. Here, we carried out a large-scale screening of ncRNAs in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and provide evidence for SUT and CUT function. Phenotypic data on 372 ncRNA deletion strains in 23 different growth conditions were collected, identifying ncRNAs responsible for significant cellular fitness changes. Transcriptome profiles were assembled for 18 haploid ncRNA deletion mutants and 2 essential ncRNA heterozygous deletants. Guided by the resulting RNA-seq data we analysed the genome-wide dysregulation of protein coding genes and non-coding transcripts. Novel functional ncRNAs, SUT125, SUT126, SUT035 and SUT532 that act in trans by modulating transcription factors were identified. Furthermore, we described the impact of SUTs and CUTs in modulating coding gene expression in response of different environmental conditions, regulating important biological process such as respiration (SUT125, SUT126, SUT035, SUT432), steroid biosynthesis (CUT494, SUT530, SUT468) or rRNA processing (SUT075 and snR30). Overall, this data captures and integrates the regulatory and phenotypic network of ncRNAs and protein coding genes, providing genome-wide evidence of the impact of ncRNAs on cellular homeostasis.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe yeast genome contains 25% of non-coding RNA molecules (ncRNAs), which do not translate into proteins but are involved in regulation of gene expression. ncRNAs can affect nearby genes by physically interfering with their transcription (cis mode of action), or they interact with DNA, proteins or others RNAs to regulate the expression of distant genes (trans mode of action). Examples of cis-acting ncRNAs have been broadly described, however genome-wide studies to identify functional trans-acting ncRNAs involved in global gene regulation are still lacking. Here, we used the ncRNA yeast deletion collection to score their impact on cellular function in different environmental conditions. A group of 20 ncRNAs mutants with broad fitness diversity were selected to investigate their effect on the protein and ncRNA expression network. We showed a high correlation between altered phenotypes and global transcriptional changes, in an environmental dependent manner. We confirmed the widespread trans acting expressional regulation of ncRNAs in the genome and their role in affecting transcription factors. These findings support the notion of the involvement on ncRNAs in fine tuning the cellular expression via regulations of TFs, as an advantageous RNA-mediated mechanism that can be fast and cost-effective for the cells.",

    "abstract": "Across taxa, circadian control of physiology and behavior arises from cell-autonomous oscillations in gene expression, governed by a networks of so-called  clock genes, collectively forming transcription-translation feedback loops. In modern vertebrates, these networks contain multiple copies of clock gene family members, which arose through whole genome duplication (WGD) events during evolutionary history. It remains unclear to what extent multiple copies of clock gene family members are functionally redundant or have allowed for functional diversification. We addressed this problem through an analysis of clock gene expression in the Atlantic salmon, a representative of the salmonids, a group which has undergone at least 4 rounds of WGD since the base of the vertebrate lineage, giving an unusually large complement of clock genes. By comparing expression patterns across multiple tissues, and during development, we present evidence for gene- and tissue-specific divergence in expression patterns, consistent with functional diversification of clock gene duplicates. In contrast to mammals, we found no evidence for coupling between cortisol and circadian gene expression, but cortisol mediated non-circadian regulated expression of a subset of clock genes in the salmon gill was evident. This regulation is linked to changes in gill function necessary for the transition from fresh- to sea-water in anadromous fish. Overall, this analysis emphasises the potential for a richly diversified clock gene network to serve a mixture of circadian and non-circadian functions in vertebrate groups with complex genomes.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe generation of daily (circadian) rhythms in behaviour and physiology depends on the activities of networks of so-called clock genes. In vertebrates, these have become highly complex due to a process known as whole genome duplication, which has occurred repeatedly during evolutionary history, giving rise to additional copies of key elements of the clock gene network. It remains unclear whether this results in functional redundancy, or whether it has permitted new roles for clock genes to emerge. Here, based on studies in the Atlantic salmon, a species with an unusually large complement of clock genes, we present evidence in favour of the latter scenario. We observe marked tissue-specific, and developmentally-dependent differences in the expression patterns of duplicated copies of key clock genes, and we identify a subset of clock genes whose expression is associated with the physiological preparation to migrate to sea, but is independent of circadian regulation. Associated with this, cortisol secretion is uncoupled from circadian organisation, contrasting with the situation in mammals. Our results indicate that whole genome duplication has permitted clock genes to diversify into non-circadian functions, and raise interesting questions about the ubiquity of mammal-like coupling between circadian and endocrine function.",

    "abstract": "Neurospora crassa contains a minimal Polycomb repression system, which provides rich opportunities to explore Polycomb-mediated repression across eukaryotes and enables genetic studies that can be difficult in plant and animal systems. Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 is a multi-subunit complex that deposits mono-, di-, and tri-methyl groups on lysine 27 of histone H3, and tri-methyl H3K27 is a molecular marker of transcriptionally repressed facultative heterochromatin. In mouse embryonic stem cells and multiple plant species, H2A.Z has been found to be co-localized with H3K27 methylation. H2A.Z is required for normal H3K27 methylation in these experimental systems, though the regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. We report here that Neurospora crassa mutants lacking H2A.Z or SWR-1, the ATP-dependent histone variant exchanger, exhibit a striking reduction in levels of H3K27 methylation. RNA-sequencing revealed downregulation of eed, encoding a subunit of PRC2, in an hH2Az mutant compared to wild type and overexpression of EED in a {Delta}hH2Az;{Delta}eed background restored most H3K27 methylation. Reduced eed expression leads to region-specific losses of H3K27 methylation suggesting that EED-dependent mechanisms are critical for normal H3K27 methylation at certain regions in the genome.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEukaryotic DNA is packaged with histone proteins to form a DNA-protein complex called chromatin. Inside the nucleus, chromatin can be assembled into a variety of higher-order structures that profoundly impact gene expression. Polycomb Group proteins are important chromatin regulators that control assembly of a highly condensed form of chromatin. The functions of Polycomb Group proteins are critical for maintaining stable gene repression during development of multicellular organisms, and defects in Polycomb proteins are linked to disease. There is significant interest in elucidating the molecular mechanisms that regulate the activities of Polycomb Group proteins and the assembly of transcriptionally repressed chromatin domains. In this study, we used a model fungus to investigate the regulatory relationship between a histone variant, H2A.Z, and a conserved histone modifying enzyme complex, Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). We found that H2A.Z is required for normal expression of a PRC2 component. Mutants that lack H2A.Z have defects in chromatin structure at some parts of the genome, but not others. Identification of PRC2-target domains that are differentially dependent on EED provides insights into the diverse mechanisms that regulate assembly and maintenance of facultative heterochromatin in a simple model system.\n\nData Reference NumbersGSE146611",
