    "abstract": "Biofilms are an emerging target for new therapeutics in the effort to address the continued increase in resistance and tolerance to traditional antimicrobials. In particular, the distinct nature of the biofilm growth state often means that traditional antimicrobials, developed to combat planktonic cells, are ineffective. Biofilm treatments are designed to both reduce pathogen load at an infection site and decrease the development of resistance by rendering the embedded organisms more susceptible to treatment at lower antimicrobial concentrations. In this work, we developed a new antimicrobial treatment modality by characterizing the natural capacity of two lactobacilli, L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus, to inhibit P. aeruginosa growth, biofilm formation, and biofilm viability. We further engineered these lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to secrete enzymes known to degrade P. aeruginosa biofilms and show that our best performing engineered LAB, secreting a pathogen-derived enzyme (PelAhyd), degrades up to 85 % of P. aeruginosa biofilm.",

    "abstract": "0.1The assembly and binning of metagenomically-assembled genomes (MAGs) using Illumina sequencing has improved the genomic characterization of unculturable communities. However, short-read-only metagenomic assemblies rarely result in completed genomes because of the difficulty assembling repetitive regions. Here, we present a strategy to complete and validate multiple MAGs from a bacterial community using a combination of short and ultra long reads (N50 > 25 kb). Our strategy is to perform an initial long read-only metagenomic assembly using metaFlye, followed by multiple rounds of polishing using both long and short reads. To validate the genomes, we verified that longs reads spanned the regions that were not supported by uniquely mapped paired-end Illumina sequences. We obtained multiple complete genomes from a naphthenic acid-degrading community, including one from the recently proposed Candidate Phyla Radiation. The majority of the population is represented by the assembled genomes; recruiting 63.77 % of Nanopore reads, and 64.38 % of Illumina reads. The pipeline we developed will enable researchers to validate genomes from metagenomic assemblies, increasing the quality of metagenomically assembled genomes through additional scrutiny.",

    "abstract": "Malignant transformation depends on genetic and epigenetic events that result in a burst of deregulated gene expression and chromatin changes. To dissect the sequence of events in this process, we used a T cell-specific lymphoma model based on the human oncogenic NPM-ALK translocation. We find that transformation of T cells shifts thymic cell populations to an undifferentiated immunophenotype, which occurs only after a period of latency, accompanied by induction of the MYC-NOTCH1 axis and deregulation of key epigenetic enzymes. We discover aberrant DNA methylation patterns, overlapping with regulatory regions, plus a high degree of epigenetic heterogeneity between individual tumors. In addition, ALK positive tumors show a loss of collaborative methylation patterns of neighboring CpG sites. Notably, deletion of the maintenance DNA methyltransferase DNMT1 completely abrogates lymphomagenesis in this model, despite oncogenic signaling through NPM-ALK, suggesting that faithful maintenance of tumor-specific methylation through DNMT1 is essential for sustained proliferation and tumorigenesis.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEEpigenetic alterations are causally involved in tumorigenesis. Here we show that induction of a single human oncogene in murine T cells induces specific deregulation of epigenetic enzymes resulting in epigenomic alterations similar to human tumors. Our findings are of broader implication to understand how epigenomic processes are shaped by oncogene induced transformation.",

In eutherian mammals, this joint forms in the embryo, supporting feeding and vocalisation from birth. In contrast, marsupials and monotremes exhibit extreme altriciality and are born before the bones of the novel mammalian jaw joint form. These mammals need to rely on other mechanisms to allow them to feed. Here we show that this vital function is carried out by the earlier developing, cartilaginous incus of the middle ear, abutting the cranial base to form a cranio-mandibular articulation. The nature of this articulation varies between monotremes and marsupials, with monotremes retaining a double articulation, similar to that described in the fossil mammaliaform, Morganucodon, while marsupials use a versican rich matrix to stabilise the jaw against the cranial base. These findings provide novel insight into the evolution of mammals and the relationship between the jaw and ear.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila sensory organ precursors divide asymmetrically to generate pIIa/pIIb cells whose identity relies on the differential activation of Notch at cytokinesis. While Notch is present apically and basally relative to the midbody at the pIIa-pIIb interface, only the basal pool of Notch is reported to contribute to Notch activation in the pIIa cell. Correct intra-lineage signalling requires appropriate apico-basal targeting of Notch, its ligand Delta and its trafficking partner Sanpodo. We previously reported that AP-1 and Stratum regulate the intracellular trafficking of Notch and Sanpodo from the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral membrane. Loss of AP-1 or Stratum caused mild Notch gain-of-function phenotypes. Here, we report that the concomitant loss of AP-1 and Stratum results in a much more penetrant Notch gain-of-function phenotype indicating that AP-1 and Strat control two parallel pathways. While unequal partitioning of cell fate determinants and cell polarity were unaffected, Numb-mediated symmetry breaking is impaired. We further observed increased amounts of signaling competent Notch as well as Delta and Sanpodo at the apical pIIa-pIIb interface and the loss of the basal pool of Notch. We propose that AP-1 and Stratum operate in two parallel pathways to ensure the correct apico-basal localization of Notch controlling where receptor activation takes place.",

Though the approach is similar to my earlier published work that done with tomato seedlings, in case of eggplant, duration of the seed germination, age of the seedlings, symptom timing and progression rate of the disease are different. In an introductory observation, R. solanacearum F1C1 inoculation was performed in to 10-12 days old eggplant seedlings resulted in lethal infection in eggplant seedlings and subsequently most of these infected seedlings got wilted within 10 days of post-inoculation. Colonization studies of R. solanacearum in wilted as well as infected eggplant seedlings were confirmed by GUS staining as well as fluorescence microscopy. In addition, we also observed that wrapping of the eggplant seedlings root by a thin layer of cotton soon after the pathogen inoculation in the root, enhanced the disease progression and wilting of the inoculated seedlings. The standardized root inoculation protocol in eggplant seedlings was found to be efficient to distinguish mutant strains of different virulence genes such as hrpB, phcA and pilT from wild-type R. solanacearum. Due to its reproducibility and consistency in different eggplant cultivars, the standardized protocol described here is practically observed as an useful and rapid approach to investigate R. solanacearum pathogenicity and disease progression at the early seedling stage of eggplant.",

    "abstract": "In the history of phonological theory, the paradigm of computational systems has shifted in tandem with a better understanding of substantive issues such as typology, acquisition, social variation, and historical change in sound structure. The paradigm shift in the past 50 years can simply be characterized as the one from  serial derivation by rules to  parallel evaluation by constraints, and now Optimality Theory (OT) focusses on substantive issues by improving its phonetic groundings and has ceased groping for a better mode of computation. This is because OT is primarily a substantive theory of CON, and at least in its standard version, the computational systems of Eval and GEN are merely  given assumptions.\n\nIn this article, we will overview some arguments against OT in substantive respects. As an ultimate problem in substance, it cannot solve  the poverty paradox, which means the paradox of  the poverty of the stimulus in ontogeny and  the poverty of the inheritance in phylogeny. Moreover, as a proximate problem in substance, certain gaps to be missed in syllable typology would erroneously be predicted to exist by OT. Alternatively, we will rethink the mode of computation in phonology and propose a new paradigm for phonology from the viewpoint of language evolution under a minimalist lens. Our proposal is based on Fujitas (2016a, 2017) Hypothesis on Motor Control Origin of Merge in Language Evolution, which solves  the poverty paradox and thus satisfies both explanatory and evolutionary adequacy. We will demonstrate that substantive findings in OT can successfully be carried over to this scenario, in which the empirical problem concerning the typological gap is offered a reasonable explanation. We will also show that phonology has a vital role in computation and is not merely a subsidiary issue at the interface of the Sensory-Motor systems in linearization or externalization. We will take up one case for this claim: the English syllable CCVC has structural ambiguity, which means that phonology involves internalization with some mechanisms in order to create different hierarchical structures.",

Therefore, this paper presents an investigation on deep feedforward networks models for classification of transposon-derived piRNAs. We analyze and compare the results of the neural networks in different hyperparameters choices, such as number of layers, activation functions and optimizers, clarifying the advantages and disadvantages of each configuration. From this analysis, we propose a model for human piRNAs classification and compare our method with the state-of-the-art deep neural network for piRNA prediction in the literature and also traditional machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, showing that our model has achieved a great performance with an F-measure value of 0.872, outperforming the state-of-the-art method in the literature.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCytosine methylation is a common DNA modification found in most eukaryotic organisms including plants, animals, and fungi. (Cytosine-5)-DNA methyltransferases (C5-DNA MTases) belong to the DNMT family of enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) to cytosine residues of DNA. In mammals, four members of the DNMT family have been reported: DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b and DNMT3L, but only DNMT1, DNMT3a and DNMT3b possess methyltransferase activity. There have been many reports about the methylation landscape in different organisms yet there is no systematic report of how the enzyme DNA (C5) methyltransferases have evolved in different organisms.\n\nResultDNA methyltransferases are found to be present in all three domains of life. However, significant variability has been observed in length, copy number and sequence identity when compared across kingdoms. Sequence conservation is greatly increased in invertebrates and vertebrates compared to other groups. Similarly, sequence length has been found to be increased while domain lengths remain more or less conserved. Vertebrates are also found to be associated with more conserved DNMT domains. Finally, comparison between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) prevailing in human populations and evolutionary changes in DNMT vertebrate alignment revealed that most of the SNPs were conserved in vertebrates.\n\nConclusionThe sequences (including the catalytic domain and motifs) and structure of the DNMT enzymes have been evolved greatly from bacteria to vertebrates with a steady increase in complexity and specificity. This study provides a systematic report of the evolution of DNA methyltransferase enzyme across different lineages of tree of life.",

    "abstract": "The development of genome-informed methods for identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL) and studying the genetic basis of quantitative variation in natural and experimental populations has been driven by advances in high-throughput genotyping. For many complex traits, the underlying genetic variation is caused by the segregation of one or more  large-effect loci, in addition to an unknown number of loci with effects below the threshold of statistical detection. The large-effect loci segregating in populations are often necessary but not sufficient for predicting quantitative phenotypes. They are, nevertheless, important enough to warrant deeper study and direct modelling in genomic prediction problems. We explored the accuracy of statistical methods for estimating the fraction of marker-associated genetic variance (p) and heritability [Formula] for large-effect loci underlying complex phenotypes. We found that commonly used statistical methods overestimate p and [Formula]. The source of the upward bias was traced to inequalities between the expected values of variance components in the numerators and denominators of these parameters. Algebraic solutions for bias-correcting estimates of p and [Formula] were found that only depend on the degrees of freedom and are constant for a given study design. We discovered that average semivariance methods, which have heretofore not been used in complex trait analyses, yielded unbiased estimates of p and [Formula], in addition to best linear unbiased predictors of the additive and dominance effects of the underlying loci. The cryptic bias problem described here is unrelated to selection bias, although both cause the overestimation of p and [Formula]. The solutions we described are predicted to more accurately describe the contributions of large-effect loci to the genetic variation underlying complex traits of medical, biological, and agricultural importance.\n\nAuthor summaryThe contributions of individual genes to the phenotypic variation observed for genetically complex traits has been an ongoing and important challenge in biology, medicine, and agriculture. While many genes have statistically undetectable effects, those with large effects often warrant in-depth study and can be important predictors of complex phenotypes such as disease risk in humans or disease resistance in domesticated plants and animals. The genes identified through associations with genetic markers in complex trait analyses typically account for a fraction of the heritable variation, a genetic parameter we called  marker heritability. We discovered that textbook statistical methods systematically overestimate marker heritability and thus overestimate the contributions of specific genes to the phenotypic variation observed for complex traits in natural and experimental populations. We describe the source of the upward bias, validate our findings through computer simulation, describe methods for bias-correcting estimates of marker heritability, and illustrate their application through empirical examples. The statistical methods we describe supply investigators with more accurate estimates of the contributions of specific genes or networks of interacting genes to the heritable variation observed in complex trait studies.",

    "abstract": "Caves offer selective pressures that are distinct from the surface. Organisms that have evolved to exist under these pressures typically exhibit a suite of convergent characteristics, including a loss or reduction of eyes and pigmentation. As a result, cave-obligate taxa, termed troglobionts, are no longer viable on the surface. This circumstance has led to a \"caves as islands\" model of troglobiont evolution that predicts extreme genetic divergence between cave populations even across relatively small areas. An effective test of this model would involve (1) common troglobionts from (2) nearby caves in a cave-dense region, (3) good sample sizes per cave, (4) multiple taxa, and (5) genome-wide characterization. With these criteria in mind, we used RAD-seq to genotype an average of ten individuals of the troglobiotic spider Nesticus barri and the troglobiotic beetle Ptomaphagus hatchi, each from four closely located caves (ranging from 3-13 km apart) in the cave-rich southern Cumberland Plateau of Tennessee, USA. Consistent with the caves as islands model, we find that populations from separate caves are indeed highly genetically isolated. In addition, nucleotide diversity was correlated to cave length, suggesting that cave size is a dominant force shaping troglobiont population size and genetic diversity. Our results support the idea of caves as natural laboratories for the study of parallel evolutionary processes.",

    "abstract": "Cytokine storms are drivers of pathology and mortality in myriad viral infections affecting the human population. In SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, the strength of the cytokine storm has been associated with increased risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome, myocardial damage, and death. However, the therapeutic value of attenuating the cytokine storm in COVID-19 remains to be defined. Here, we report results obtained using a novel mouse model of lethal sterile anti-viral immune responses. Using a mouse model of Down syndrome (DS) with a segmental duplication of a genomic region encoding four of the six interferon receptor genes (Ifnrs), we demonstrate that these animals overexpress Ifnrs and are hypersensitive to IFN stimulation. When challenged with viral mimetics that activate Toll-like receptor signaling and IFN anti-viral responses, these animals overproduce key cytokines, show exacerbated liver pathology, rapidly lose weight, and die. Importantly, the lethal immune hypersensitivity, accompanying cytokine storm, and liver hyperinflammation are blocked by treatment with a JAK1-specific inhibitor. Therefore, these results point to JAK1 inhibition as a potential strategy for attenuating the cytokine storm and consequent organ failure during overdrive immune responses. Additionally, these results indicate that people with DS, who carry an extra copy of the IFNR gene cluster encoded on chromosome 21, should be considered at high risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryInhibition of the JAK1 kinase prevents pathology and mortality caused by a rampant innate immune response in mice.",

The central response regulator protein CheY can bind to the motor of the motility structure, the flagellum in bacteria and the archaellum in archaea. Both motility structures have a fundamentally different protein composition and structural organization. Yet, both systems receive input from the chemotaxis system. We applied a fluorescent microscopy approach in the model euryarchaeon Haloferax volcanii, and shed light on the sequence order in which signals are transferred from the chemotaxis system to the archaellum. Our findings indicate that the euryarchaeal specific ArlCDE are part of the archaellum motor and that they directly receive input from the chemotaxis system via the adaptor protein CheF. Hence, ArlCDE are an important feature of the archaellum of euryarchaea, are essential for signal transduction during chemotaxis and represent the archaeal switch complex.",

We characterized the performance of the new NIR GECIs in cultured cells, acute mouse brain slices, and C. elegans and Xenopus laevis in vivo.

    "abstract": "The neurotransmitter serotonin controls a great variety of physiological and behavioral processes. In humans, mutations affecting the monoamine oxidase or MAO, the serotonin-degrading enzyme, are highly deleterious. Yet, blind cavefish of the species A. mexicanus carry a partial loss-of-function mutation in MAO (P106L) and seem to thrive in their subterranean environment. Here, we established 4 fish lines, corresponding to the blind cave-dwelling and the sighted river-dwelling morphs of this species, with or without the mutation, in order to decipher the exact contribution of mao P106L in the evolution of cavefish neuro-behavioral traits. Unexpectedly, although mao P106L appeared as an excellent candidate for the genetic determinism of the loss of aggressive and schooling behaviors in cavefish, we demonstrated that it was not the case. Similarly, the anatomical variations in monoaminergic systems observed between cavefish and surface fish brains were independent from mao P106L, and rather due other, morph-dependent developmental processes. On the other hand, we found that mao P106L strongly affected anxiety-like behaviors. Cortisol measurements showed lower basal levels and an increased amplitude of stress response after a change of environment in fish carrying the mutation. Finally, we studied the distribution of the P106L mao allele in wild populations of cave and river A. mexicanus, and discovered that the mutant allele was present - and sometimes fixed - in all populations inhabiting caves of the Sierra de El Abra. The possibility that this partial loss-of-function mao allele evolves under a selective or a genetic drift regime in the particular cave environment is discussed.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchy is a major organizational principle of the cortex and underscores modern computational theories of cortical function. The local microcircuit amplifies long-distance inter-areal input, which show distance-dependent changes in their laminar profiles. Statistical modeling of these changes in laminar profiles demonstrates that inputs from multiple hierarchical levels to their target areas show remarkable consistency, allowing the construction of a cortical hierarchy based on a principle of hierarchical distance. The statistical modeling that is applied to structure can also be applied to laminar differences in the oscillatory coherence between areas thereby determining a functional hierarchy of the cortex. Close examination of the anatomy of inter-areal connectivity reveals a dual counterstream architecture with well-defined distance-dependent feedback and feedforward pathways in both the supra- and infragranular layers, suggesting a multiplicity of feedback pathways with well-defined functional properties. These findings are consistent with feedback connections providing a generative network involved in a wide range of cognitive functions. A dynamical model constrained by connectivity data shed insights into the experimentally observed signatures of frequency-dependent Granger causality for feedforward versus feedback signaling. Concerted experiments capitalizing on recent technical advances and combining tract-tracing, high-resolution fMRI, optogenetics and mathematical modeling hold the promise of a much improved understanding of lamina-constrained mechanisms of neural computation and cognition. However, because inter-areal interactions involve cortical layers that have been the target of important evolutionary changes in the primate lineage, these investigations will need to include human and non-human primates comparisons.\n\nPlanO_LIIntroduction\nC_LIO_LIHierarchy - signatures of inputs to the local circuits.\nC_LIO_LIModels of hierarchy\nC_LIO_LIHierarchy - input consistency\nC_LIO_LIDual stream architecture.\nC_LIO_LIFunctional characteristics of FF and FB pathways.\nC_LIO_LIThe predictive brain and the importance of top-down generative networks.\nC_LIO_LIConclusion.\nC_LI",

Any mismatch between predicted and current input (prediction error) is then fed forward up the hierarchy leading to a revision of the prediction. We tested this hypothesis in the domain of object vision using a combination of multivariate pattern analysis and time-resolved electroencephalography. We presented participants with sequences of images that stepped around fixation in a predictable order. On the majority of presentations, the images conformed to a consistent pattern of position order and object category order, however, on a subset of presentations the last image in the sequence violated the established pattern by either violating the predicted category or position of the object. Contrary to classic predictive coding when decoding position and category we found no differences in decoding accuracy between predictable and violation conditions. However, consistent with recent extensions of predictive coding, exploratory analyses showed that a greater proportion of predictions was made to the forthcoming position in the sequence than to either the previous position or the position behind the previous position suggesting that the visual system actively anticipates future input as opposed to just inferring current input.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression requires two steps - transcription and translation - which can be regulated independently to allow nuanced, localized, and rapid responses to cellular stimuli. Neurons are known to respond transcriptionally and translationally to bursts of brain activity, and a transcriptional response to this activation has also been recently characterized in astrocytes. However, the extent to which astrocytes respond translationally is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that astrocytes also have a programmed translational response by characterizing the change in transcript ribosome occupancy in astrocytes using Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification(TRAP) subsequent to a robust induction of neuronal activity in vivo via acute seizure. We identified a change in transcripts on astrocyte ribosomes, highlighted by a rapid decrease in transcripts coding for ribosomal and mitochondrial components, and a rapid increase in transcripts related to cytoskeletal dynamics, motor activity, ion transport, and cell communication. This indicates a set of dynamic responses, some of which might be secondary to activation of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase(TRK) signaling. Using acute slices, we quantified the extent to which individual cues and sequela of neuronal activity can activate translation acutely in astrocytes. We identified both BDNF and ion concentration changes as contributors to translation induction, with potassium using both action-potential sensitive and insensitive components. We showed this translational response requires the presence of neurons, indicating the response is non-cell autonomous. We also show that this induction of new translation extends into peripheral astrocyte processes (PAPs). Accordingly, proteomics following fear conditioning in mice, showed that new translation influences peri-synaptic astrocyte protein composition in vivo under physiological conditions. Regulation of translation in astrocytes by neuronal activity suggests an additional mechanism by which astrocytes may dynamically modulate nervous system functioning.\n\nMain PointsAstrocytes have a programmed, transcript-specific translational response to neuronal activity.\n\nBoth BDNF and K+, cues of neuronal activity, trigger this response.\n\nThis response requires the presence of neurons.\n\nThis response alters the astrocytic protein composition at the synapse.",

    "abstract": "Fertilization and seed development is a critical time in the plant life cycle, and coordinated development of the embryo and endosperm are required to produce a viable seed. In the endosperm, some genes show imprinted expression where transcripts are derived primarily from one parental genome. Imprinted gene expression has been observed across many flowering plant species, though only a small proportion of genes are imprinted. Understanding the rate of turnover for gain or loss of imprinted expression has been complicated by the reliance on single nucleotide polymorphisms between alleles to enable testing for imprinting. Here, we develop a method to use whole genome assemblies of multiple genotypes to assess for imprinting of both shared and variable portions of the genome using data from reciprocal crosses. This reveals widespread maternal expression of genes and transposable elements with presence-absence variation within maize and across species. Most maternally expressed features are expressed primarily in the endosperm, suggesting that maternal de-repression in the central cell facilitates expression. Furthermore, maternally expressed TEs are enriched for maternal expression of the nearest gene. Read alignments over maternal TE-gene pairs indicate fused transcripts, suggesting that variable TEs contribute imprinted expression of nearby genes.",

    "abstract": "Transposons are mobile DNAs that can cause fatal mutations. To counteract these genome invaders, the host genomes deploy small interfering (si) RNAs to initiate and establish the epigenetic silencing. However, the regulatory mechanisms for the selective recognition of transposons by the host genomes remain still elusive. Here we show that plant transposon RNAs undergo frequent ribosome stalling caused by their inherently unfavourable codon sequence usage. The ribosome stalling then causes the RNA truncation and the localization to siRNA bodies, which are both critical prerequisites for the siRNA processing. In addition, SGS3, the key protein in the siRNA biogenesis pathway, forms liquid droplets in vitro through its prion-like domains implicating the role of liquid-liquid phase separation in the formation of the siRNA bodies. Our study provides a novel insight into the regulatory mechanisms for the recognition of invasive genetic elements which is essential for the maintenance of genome integrity.",

    "abstract": "Webers law states that the ratio of the smallest perceptual change in an input signal and the background signal is constant. The law is observed across the perception of weight, light intensity, and sound intensity and pitch. Conventionally, two models of perception have been proposed to explain Webers law, namely the logarithmic and the linear model. Later, another formulation of Webers law was proposed which links it with exact adaptation. This paper argues in favour of the linear model, which requires the sensory system to generate linear input-output relationship over several orders of magnitude. To this end, a four-node motif (FNM) is constructed from first principles whose series provides almost linear relationship between input signal and output over arbitrary range of input signal. Mathematical analysis into the origin of this quasi-linear relationship shows that the series of coherent type-1 feed-forward loop (C1-FFL) is able to provide perfectly linear input-output relationship over arbitrary range of input signal. FNM also reproduces the neuronal data of numerosity detection study on monkey. The series of FNM also provides a mechanism for sensitive detection over arbitrary range of input signal when the output has an upper limit. Further, the series of FNM provides a general basis for a class of bow-tie architecture where the number of receptors is much lower than the range of input signal and the \"decoded output\". Besides (quasi-)linear input-output relationship, another example of this class of bow-tie architecture that the series of FNM is able to produce is absorption spectra of cone opsins of humans. Further, the series of FNM and C1-FFL, respectively, can compute logarithm over arbitrary range of input signal.",

Herein, SARS-CoV-2 RBD with gram level were obtained through Chinese hamster ovary cells high-density fermentation. The binding of RBD to SARS-CoV-2 receptor, human ACE2, was verified and the efficacy of RBD in vivo was tested on mice and then on horses. As a result, RBD triggered high-titer neutralizing antibodies in vivo, and immunoglobulin fragment F(ab)2 was prepared from horse antisera through removing Fc. Neutralization test demonstrated that RBD-specific F(ab)2 inhibited SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 at 0.07 g/ml, showing a potent inhibitory effect on SARS-CoV-2.

    "abstract": "The repurposing of existing drugs offers the potential to expedite therapeutic discovery against the current COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We have developed an integrative approach to predict repurposed drug candidates that can reverse SARS-CoV-2-induced gene expression in host cells, and evaluate their efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. We found that 13 virus-induced gene expression signatures computed from various viral preclinical models could be reversed by compounds previously identified to be effective against SARS- or MERS-CoV, as well as drug candidates recently reported to be efficacious against SARS-CoV-2. Based on the ability of candidate drugs to reverse these 13 infection signatures, as well as other clinical criteria, we identified 10 novel candidates. The four drugs bortezomib, dactolisib, alvocidib, and methotrexate inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells at < 1 {micro}M, but only methotrexate did not exhibit unfavorable cytotoxicity. Although further improvement of cytotoxicity prediction and bench testing is required, our computational approach has the potential to rapidly and rationally identify repurposed drug candidates against SARS-CoV-2. The analysis of signature genes induced by SARS-CoV-2 also revealed interesting time-dependent host response dynamics and critical pathways for therapeutic interventions (e.g. Rho GTPase activation and cytokine signaling suppression).",

    "abstract": "Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in December 2019, Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) has rapidly spread across the globe. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that age is one of the strongest risk factors influencing the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. Here, we interrogate the transcriptional features and cellular landscapes of the aging human lung through integrative analysis of bulk and single-cell transcriptomics. By intersecting these age-associated changes with experimental data on host interactions between SARS-CoV-2 or its relative SARS-CoV, we identify several age-associated factors that may contribute to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. We observed that age-associated gene expression and cell populations are significantly linked to the heightened severity of COVID-19 in older populations. The aging lung is characterized by increased vascular smooth muscle contraction, reduced mitochondrial activity, and decreased lipid metabolism. Lung epithelial cells, macrophages, and Th1 cells decrease in abundance with age, whereas fibroblasts, pericytes and CD4+ Tcm cells increase in abundance with age. Several age-associated genes have functional effects on SARS-CoV replication, and directly interact with the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Interestingly, age-associated genes are heavily enriched among those induced or suppressed by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These analyses illuminate potential avenues for further studies on the relationship between the aging lung and COVID-19 pathogenesis, which may inform strategies to more effectively treat this disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCOVID-19 is a disease with global public health emergency that have shook the world since its first detection in China in December, 2019. Severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen responsible behind this pandemic. The lethality of different viral strains is found to vary in different geographical locations but the molecular mechanism is yet to be known.\n\nMethodsAvailable data of whole genome sequencing of different viral strains published by different countries were retrieved and then analysed using Multiple Sequence Alignment and Pair-wise Sequence Alignment leading to Phylogenetic tree construction. Each location and the corresponding genetic variations were screened in depth. Then the variations are analysed at protein level giving special emphasis on Non Synonymous amino acid substitutions. The fatality rates in different countries were matched against the mutation number, rarity of the nucleotide alterations and functional impact of the Non Synonymous changes at protein level, separately and in combination.\n\nFindingsAll the viral strains have been found to evolve from the viral strain of Taiwan (MT192759) which is 100% identical with the ancestor SARS-CoV-2 sequences of Wuhan (NC 045512.2; submitted on 5th Jan, 2020). Transition from C to T (C>T) is the most frequent mutation in this viral genome and mutations A>T, G>A, T>A are the rarest ones, found in countries with maximum fatality rate i.e Italy, Spain and Sweden. 20 Non Synonymous mutations are located in viral genome spanning Orf1ab polyprotein, Surface glycoprotein, Nucleocapsid protein etc. The functional effect on the structure and function of the protein can favourably or unfavourably interact with the host body.\n\nInterpretationThe fatality outcome depends on three important factors (a) number of mutation (b) rarity of the allelic variation and (c) functional consequence of the mutation at protein level. The molecular divergence, evolved from the ancestral strain (S) lead to extremely lethal (E), lethal(L) and non lethal (N) strains with the involvement of an Intermediate strain(I).",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTDespite the current devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, several recent studies have suggested that the immunosuppressive drug Tocilizumab can powerfully treating inflammatory responses that occur in this disease. Here, by employing single-cell analysis of the immune cell composition of severe-stage COVID-19 patients and these same patients in post Tocilizumab-treatment remission, we have identified a monocyte subpopulation specific to severe disease that contributes to inflammatory storms in COVID-19 patients. Although Tocilizumab treatment attenuated the strong inflammatory immune response, we found that immune cells including plasma B cells and CD8+ T cells still exhibited an intense humoral and cell-mediated anti-virus immune response in COVID-19 patients after Tocilizumab treatment. Thus, in addition to providing a rich, very high-resolution data resource about the immune cell distribution at multiple stages of the COVID-19 disease, our work both helps explain Tocilizumab\u2019s powerful therapeutic effects and defines a large number of potential new drug targets related to inflammatory storms.Competing Interest StatementJingwen Fang is the executive officer of HanGen BiotechView Full Text",

    "abstract": "In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 emerged causing the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV, the agent responsible for the 2003 SARS outbreak, utilizes ACE2 and TMPRSS2 host molecules for viral entry. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have recently been implicated in SARS-CoV-2 viral infection. Additional host molecules including ADAM17, cathepsin L, CD147, and GRP78 may also function as receptors for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nTo determine the expression and in situ localization of candidate SARS-CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory mucosa, we analyzed gene expression datasets from airway epithelial cells of 515 healthy subjects, gene promoter activity analysis using the FANTOM5 dataset containing 120 distinct sample types, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of 10 healthy subjects, immunoblots on multiple airway epithelial cell types, and immunohistochemistry on 98 human lung samples.\n\nWe demonstrate absent to low ACE2 promoter activity in a variety of lung epithelial cell samples and low ACE2 gene expression in both microarray and scRNAseq datasets of epithelial cell populations. Consistent with gene expression, rare ACE2 protein expression was observed in the airway epithelium and alveoli of human lung. We present confirmatory evidence for the presence of TMPRSS2, CD147, and GRP78 protein in vitro in airway epithelial cells and confirm broad in situ protein expression of CD147 in the respiratory mucosa.\n\nCollectively, our data suggest the presence of a mechanism dynamically regulating ACE2 expression in human lung, perhaps in periods of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and also suggest that alternate receptors for SARS-CoV-2 exist to facilitate initial host cell infection.",

    "abstract": "By engaging angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2 or Ace2), the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may invade host cells in many organs, including the brain. However, the distribution of ACE2 in the brain is still obscure. Here we investigated the ACE2 expression in the brain by analyzing data from publicly available brain transcriptome databases. According to our spatial distribution analysis, ACE2 was relatively highly expressed in some brain locations, such as the choroid plexus and paraventricular nuclei of the thalamus. According to cell-type distribution analysis, nuclear expression of ACE2 was found in many neurons (both excitatory and inhibitory neurons) and some non-neuron cells (mainly astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells) in human middle temporal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex. A few ACE2-expressing nuclei were found in a hippocampal dataset, and none were detected in the prefrontal cortex. Except for the additional high expression of Ace2 in the olfactory bulb areas for spatial distribution as well as in the pericytes and endothelial cells for cell-type distribution, the distribution of Ace2 in mouse brain was similar to that in the human brain. Thus, our results reveal an outline of ACE2/Ace2 distribution in the human and mouse brain, which indicates the brain infection of SARS-CoV-2 may be capable of inducing central nervous system symptoms in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. Potential species differences should be considered when using mouse models to study the neurological effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Lastly, we have identified peptides in the S glycoprotein that are likely to be presented in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complexes, and discuss the role of S protein glycosylation in potentially modulating the adaptive immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or to a related vaccine.\n\nThe 3D structures show that the protein surface is extensively shielded from antibody recognition by glycans, with the exception of the ACE2 receptor binding domain, and also that the degree of shielding is largely insensitive to the specific glycoform. Despite the relatively modest contribution of the glycans to the total molecular weight (17% for the HEK293 glycoform) the level of surface shielding is disproportionately high at 42%.",

Although the use of ready-made reaction mixes can enable more rapid PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19, the need to transport and store these mixes at low temperatures presents challenges to already overburdened logistics networks. Here, we present an optimized freeze-drying procedure that allows SARS-CoV-2 PCR mixes to be transported and stored at ambient temperatures, without loss of activity. Additive-supplemented PCR mixes were freeze-dried. The residual moisture of the freeze-dried PCR mixes was measured by Karl-Fischer titration. We found that freeze-dried PCR mixes with [~]1.2% residual moisture are optimal for storage, transport, and reconstitution. The sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability of the freeze-dried reagents were similar to those of freshly prepared, wet reagents. The freeze-dried mixes retained activity at room temperature (18[~]25{degrees}C) for 28 days, and for 14 and 10 days when stored at 37{degrees}C and 56{degrees}C, respectively. The uptake of this approach will ease logistical challenges faced by transport networks and make more cold storage space available at diagnosis and hospital laboratories. This method can also be applied to the generation of freeze-dried PCR mixes for the detection of other pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic gene fusions are estimated to account for up-to 20 % of cancer morbidity. Originally, oncofusions were identified in blood cancer, but recently multiple sequence-level studies of cancer genomes have established oncofusions throughout all tissue types. However, the functional implications of the identified oncofusions have often not been investigated. In this study, the identified oncofusions from a fusion detection approach (DEEPEST) were analyzed in more detail. In total, DEEPEST contains 28863 unique fusions. From sequence analysis, we found that almost 30% of them (8225) are expected to produce functional fusion proteins with features from both parent genes. Kinases and transcription factors were found to be the main gene families of the protein producing fusions. Considering their role as initiators, actors, and termination points of cellular signaling pathways, we focused our in-depth analyses on them. The domain architecture of the fusions, as well as of their expected interactors, suggests that abnormal molecular context of intact protein domains brought about by fusion events may unlock the oncogenic potential of the wild type counterparts of the fusion proteins. To understand overall effects of oncofusions on cellular signaling, we performed differential expression analysis using TCGA cancer project samples. Results indicated oncofusion-specific alterations in expression levels of individual genes, and overall lowering of the expression levels of key cellular pathways, such as signal transduction, proteolysis, microtubule cytoskeleton organization, and in particular regulation of transcription. The sum of our results suggests that kinase and transcription factor oncofusions globally deregulate cellular signaling, possibly via acquiring novel functions.",

    "abstract": "Increased longevity has not been paralleled by extended healthspan, resulting in more years spent with multiple diseases in older age. As such, interventions to improve healthspan are urgently required. Zoledronate is a nitrogen containing bisphosphonate, which inhibits the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS) enzyme, central to the mevalonate pathway. It is already used clinically to prevent fractures in osteoporotic patients, who have been reported to derive unexpected and unexplained survival benefits. In this study we show that zoledronate has beneficial effects on both lifespan and healthspan using Drosophila as a model. We found that zoledronate extended lifespan, improved climbing activity and reduced intestinal epithelial dysplasia and permeability in aged flies. Mechanistic studies showed that zoledronate conferred resistance to oxidative stress and reduced accumulation of X-ray-induced DNA damage via inhibition of FPPS. Moreover, zoledronate inhibited pAKT in the mTOR pathway and functioned via dFOXO, a molecule associated with increased longevity, downstream of the mevalonate pathway. Taken together, our work indicates that zoledronate, a drug already widely used and dosed only once a year to prevent osteoporosis, modulates important mechanisms of ageing. Its repurposing holds great promise as a treatment to improve healthspan.",

    "abstract": "A recent paper by Enquist and colleagues1 took a very important step in predicting the ecosystemic effects of species losses on a global scale. Using Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST), they concluded that large-sized species contribute disproportionately to several ecosystem functions. One of their key predictions is that total biomass of animals in a trophic level (MTot, using their notation) should increase more than proportionally with its maximum body size (mmax), following the relationship MTot {propto} mmax5/4. Here I argue that this superlinear scaling results from an incorrect representation of the individual size distribution and that the exponent should be 1/4, implying a sublinear scaling. The same reasoning applies to total energy flux or metabolism BTot, which should be invariant to maximum size according to the energetic equivalence and perfect compensatory responses entailed by MST.",

    "abstract": "1The EEG is a well-established non-invasive method in neuroscientific research and clinical diagnostics. It provides a high temporal but low spatial resolution of brain activity. In order to gain insight about the spatial dynamics of the EEG one has to solve the inverse problem, i.e. finding the neural sources that give rise to the recorded EEG activity. The inverse problem is ill-posed, which means that more than one configuration of neural sources can evoke one and the same distribution of EEG activity on the scalp. Artificial neural networks have been previously used successfully to find either one or two dipoles sources. These approaches, however, have never solved the inverse problem in a distributed dipole model with more than two dipole sources. We present ConvDip, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture that solves the EEG inverse problem in a distributed dipole model based on simulated EEG data. We show that (1) ConvDip learned to produce inverse solutions from a single time point of EEG data and (2) outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all focused performance measures. It is more flexible when dealing with varying number of sources, produces less ghost sources and misses less real sources than the comparison methods. It produces plausible inverse solutions for real EEG recordings from human participants. (4) The trained network needs less than 40 ms for a single prediction. Our results qualify ConvDip as an efficient and easy-to-apply novel method for source localization in EEG data, with high relevance for clinical applications, e.g. in epileptology and real time applications.",

Here we report the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp either in the apo form or in complex with a 50-base template-primer RNA and Remdesivir at a resolution range of 2.5-2.8 [A]. The complex structure reveals that the partial double-stranded RNA template is inserted into the central channel of the RdRp where Remdesivir is incorporated into the first replicated base pair and terminates the chain elongation.

    "abstract": "The role of the RNAi/Dicer/Ago system to degrade RNA viruses has been elusive in mammals, which prompted authors to think that interferon (IFN) synthesis is essential in this clade relegating the RNAi defense strategy against viral infection as accessory function. We explore the theoretical possibilities that RNAi triggered by SARS-CoV-2 might degrade some host transcripts in the opposite direction although this hypothesis seems counter intuitive. SARS-CoV-2 genome was therefore computational searched for exact intra pairing within the viral RNA and also hybrid exact pairing with human transcriptome over a minimum 20 bases length. Minimal segments of 20 bases length of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were found based on the theoretical matching with existing complementary strands in the human host transcriptome. Few human genes potentially annealing with SARS-CoV-2 RNA, among them mitochondrial deubiquitinase USP30, a subunit of ubiquitin protein ligase complex FBXO21 along with two long coding RNAs were retrieved. The hypothesis that viral originated RNAi might mediate degradation of messengers of the host transcriptome was corroborated by clinical observation and phylogenetic comparative analysis indicating a strong specificity of these hybrid pairing sequences for both SARS-CoV-2 and human genomes.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 is prevalent in the elderly. Old individuals are more likely to develop pneumonia and respiratory failure due to alveolar damage, suggesting that lung senescence may increase the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication. Considering that human coronavirus (HCoVs; SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV) require host cellular factors for infection and replication, we analyzed Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data to test whether lung aging is associated with transcriptional changes in human protein-coding genes that potentially interact with these viruses. We found decreased expression of the gene tribbles homolog 3 (TRIB3) during aging in male individuals, and its protein was predicted to interact with HCoVs nucleocapsid protein and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Using publicly available lung single-cell data, we found TRIB3 expressed mainly in alveolar epithelial cells that express SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. Functional enrichment analysis of age-related genes, in common with SARS-CoV-induced perturbations, revealed genes associated with the mitotic cell cycle and surfactant metabolism. Given that TRIB3 was previously reported to decrease virus infection and replication, the decreased expression of TRIB3 in aged lungs may help explain why older male patients are related to more severe cases of the COVID-19. Thus, drugs that stimulate TRIB3 expression should be evaluated as a potential therapy for the disease.",

    "abstract": "We propose an efficient framework for genetic subtyping of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 pandemic. Efficient viral subtyping enables visualization and modeling of the geographic distribution and temporal dynamics of disease spread. Subtyping thereby advances the development of effective containment strategies and, potentially, therapeutic and vaccine strategies. However, identifying viral subtypes in real-time is challenging: SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, and the pandemic is rapidly expanding. Viral subtypes may be difficult to detect due to rapid evolution; founder effects are more significant than selection pressure; and the clustering threshold for subtyping is not standardized. We propose to identify mutational signatures of available SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a population-based approach: an entropy measure followed by frequency analysis. These signatures, Informative Subtype Markers (ISMs), define a compact set of nucleotide sites that characterize the most variable (and thus most informative) positions in the viral genomes sequenced from different individuals. Through ISM compression, we find that certain distant nucleotide variants covary, including non-coding and ORF1ab sites covarying with the D614G spike protein mutation which has become increasingly prevalent as the pandemic has spread.\n\nISMs are also useful for downstream analyses, such as spatiotemporal visualization of viral dynamics. By analyzing sequence data available in the GISAID database, we validate the utility of ISM-based subtyping by comparing spatiotemporal analyses using ISMs to epidemiological studies of viral transmission in Asia, Europe, and the United States. In addition, we show the relationship of ISMs to phylogenetic reconstructions of SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and therefore, ISMs can play an important complementary role to phylogenetic tree-based analysis, such as is done in the Nextstrain [1] project. The developed pipeline dynamically generates ISMs for newly added SARS-CoV-2 sequences and updates the visualization of pandemic spatiotemporal dynamics, and is available on Github at https://github.com/EESI/ISM and via an interactive website at https://covid19-ism.coe.drexel.edu/.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe novel coronavirus responsible for COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, expanded to reportedly 8.7 million confirmed cases worldwide by June 21, 2020. The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic highlights the importance of tracking viral transmission dynamics in real-time. Through June 2020, researchers have obtained genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from over 47,000 samples from infected individuals worldwide. Since the virus readily mutates, each sequence of an infected individual contains useful information linked to the individuals exposure location and sample date. But, there are over 30,000 bases in the full SARS-CoV-2 genome--so tracking genetic variants on a whole-sequence basis becomes unwieldy. We describe a method to instead efficiently identify and label genetic variants, or \"subtypes\" of SARS-CoV-2. Applying this method results in a compact, 11 base-long compressed label, called an Informative Subtype Marker or \"ISM\". We define viral subtypes for each ISM, and show how regional distribution of subtypes track the progress of the pandemic. Major findings include (1) covarying nucleotides with the spike protein which has spread rapidly and (2) tracking emergence of a local subtype across the United States connected to Asia and distinct from the outbreak in New York, which is found to be connected to Europe.",

    "abstract": "The global pandemic of COVID-19 disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, has produced an urgent requirement and search for improved treatments whilst effective vaccines are developed. A strategy for improved drug therapy is to increase levels of endogenous reactive metabolites for selective toxicity to SARS-CoV-2 by preferential damage to the viral proteome. Key reactive metabolites producing major quantitative damage to the proteome in physiological systems are: reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the reactive glycating agent methylglyoxal (MG); cysteine residues and arginine residues are their most susceptible targets, respectively. From sequenced-based prediction of the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, we found 0.8-fold enrichment or depletion of cysteine residues in functional domains of the viral proteome; whereas there was a 4.6-fold enrichment of arginine residues, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to oxidative agents and sensitive to MG. For arginine residues of the SARS-CoV-2 predicted to be in functional domains, we examined which are activated towards modification by MG - residues with predicted or expected low pKa by neighbouring group in interactions. We found 25 such arginine residues, including 2 in the spike protein and 10 in the nucleoprotein. These sites were partially conserved in related coronaviridae: SARS-COV and MERS. Finally, we identified drugs which increase cellular MG concentration to virucidal levels: antitumor drugs with historical antiviral activity, doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Our findings provide evidence of potential vulnerability of SARS-CoV-2 to inactivation by MG and a scientific rationale for repurposing of doxorubicin and paclitaxel for treatment of COVID-19 disease, providing efficacy and adequate therapeutic index may be established.",

    "abstract": "Biofilm-based infections are difficult to treat due to their inherent resistance to antibiotic treatment. Discovering new approaches to enhance antibiotic efficacy in biofilms would be highly significant in treating many chronic infections. Exposure to aminoglycosides induces adaptive resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Adaptive resistance is primarily the result of active antibiotic export by RND-type efflux pumps, which use the proton motive force as an energy source. We show that the protonophore uncoupler triclosan depletes the membrane potential of biofilm growing P. aeruginosa, leading to decreased activity of RND-type efflux pumps. This disruption results in increased intracellular accumulation of tobramycin and enhanced antimicrobial activity in vitro. In addition, we show that triclosan enhances tobramycin effectiveness in vivo using a mouse wound model. Combining triclosan with tobramycin is a new anti-biofilm strategy that targets bacterial energetics, increasing the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa biofilms to aminoglycosides.\n\nAuthor summaryAdaptive resistance is a phenotypic response that allows P. aeruginosa to transiently survive aminoglycosides such as tobramycin. To date, few compounds have been identified that target adaptive resistance. Here, we show the protonophore uncoupler triclosan disrupts the membrane potential of P. aeruginosa. The depletion of the membrane potential reduces efflux pump activity, which is essential for adaptive resistance, leading to increased tobramycin accumulation and a shorter onset of action. Our results demonstrate that in addition to its canonical mechanism inhibiting membrane biosynthesis, triclosan can exert antibacterial properties by functioning as a protonophore that targets P. aeruginosa energetics.",

The virus packaging efficiency of VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Sdel18 (S with C-terminal 18 amino acid truncation) is much higher than VSV-SARS-CoV-2-S.

The experimental results can be obtained by automatically counting EGFP positive cell number at 12 hours after infection, making the assay convenient and high-throughput. The serum neutralizing titer of COVID-19 convalescent patients measured by VSV-SARS-CoV-2-Sdel18 pseudovirus assay has a good correlation with live SARS-CoV-2 assay.

    "abstract": "Rice is one of the most important crops for feeding about more than half of the worlds population. Yield of rice crop is significantly hampered by various biotic and abiotic factors. Application of cost-effective and environment-friendly bioinoculant is a common practice to combat the yield losses of rice in this era. The rhizosphere and phyllosphere of rice plants provide specific habitats for various micro-organisms. In the present study, the bacterial population dwelling the rhizosphere and phyllosphere of Basmati rice were explored using metagenomic approach from rice growing areas of Punjab, Pakistan. The bacterial communities associated with the rice rhizosphere of different rice growing areas as well as phyllosphere/rhizosphere were compared. Out of 20,069 16S rRNA gene sequences retreived from rhizosphere soil, 6485 were originated from Faisalabad, 5174 from Gujranwala and 8410 from Sheikhupura. Data analyses revelead that Proteobactria was dominant phylum at all three sites. Choloflexi was second abundant phylum at Sheikhupura, while Actinobacteria and Firmicutes at Gujranwala and Faisalabad. In addition to dominant culturable PGPB Bacillus genus at all three sites, Nitrosospira, Gaiella, Marmoricola, Clostridium sensu stricto. Maximum geners were detected from Faisalabad (159), followed by Sheikhupura (146) and Gujranwala (131). Comparison of the common sequences at the genus-level revealed that maximum number of shared genera (101) were observed in Sheikhupura and Gujranwala. 50 genera were specifically related to Faisalabad, while 27 and 21 genera were detected for Sheikhupura and Gujranwala.\n\nIn the phyllosphere, Proteobacteria (79.6%) was detected as dominant phylum followed by Firmicutes (9.8%), Bacteroidetes (8.6%), Chloroflexi (4.3%) and Actinobacteria (0.9%). Comparison of phyllosphere and rhizosphere showed less bacterial diversity in the phyllosphere but Bradyrhizobium, Sphingomonas, GP6, Pseudomonas, Bacillus are abuundant. Fifteen genera were detected at both compartments. Furthermore, we may select these strains for development of compatible inocula for application in the rhizosphere and phyllosphere of rice.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDifferences have shown to exist in some echocardiographic measurements that were attributed to racial, ethnic and gender. This study determined echocardiographic baseline data of normal adult left ventricular (LV) geometry in our locality.\n\nMethodsThe study was performed on 1,192 apparently healthy adults. Participants below the age of 18 years or those with congenital or acquired cardiac abnormalities and history of long-term regular physical training were excluded. Trans-thoracic echocardiography was performed with Vivid T8 GE dedicated echocardiography machine with probe frequency of 1.7 to 3.2 MHz with integrated electrocardiography (ECG) recording electrodes. The study determined normal dimensions of interventricular diamensions. All measurements were indexed to body surface area (BSA) to obtain echocardiographic baseline normal reference values.\n\nResultsThe mean + SD values of LV parameters for male and female participants were: LVIDd (44.80 {+/-} 5.71 mm vs 42.75 {+/-} 5.21 mm), LVIDs (33.54 {+/-} 5.37 mm vs 30.38 {+/-} 4.81 mm), and LVPWd (8.32 {+/-} 1.26 mm vs 7.51 {+/-} 1.22 mm). Females had more statistically significant interventricular septum in diastole (IVSd) (8.20 {+/-} 1.38 mm vs 7.05 {+/-} 1.27 mm) and interventricular septum in systole (IVSs) (9.08 {+/-} 1.42 mm vs 8.99 {+/-} 1.33 mm) (P < 0.05).\n\nConclusionThis research established echocardiographic baseline normal adult left ventricular geometry in the study population because in order to detect abnormalities, accurate definition of normal values of echocardiographic measurements is of utmost importance for a reliable clinical decision making.",

    "abstract": "We describe how to use several machine learning techniques organized in a learning pipeline to segment and identify subcellular structures from cryo electron tomograms. These tomograms are difficult to analyze with traditional segmentation tools. The learning pipeline in our approach starts from supervised learning via a special convolutional neural network trained with simulated data. It continues with semi-supervised reinforcement learning and/or a region merging techniques that try to piece together disconnected components that should belong to the same subcellular structure. A parametric or non-parametric fitting procedure is then used to enhance the segmentation results and quantify uncertainties in the fitting. Domain knowledge is used in generating the training data for the neural network and in guiding the fitting procedure through the use of appropriately chosen priors and constraints. We demonstrate that the approach proposed here work well for extracting membrane surfaces of protein reconstituted liposomes in a cellular environment that contains other artifacts.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, antimicrobial resistance has been increasingly reported. One main concern is the resistance of gram-negative bacteria like E. coli to ciprofloxacin (fluoroquinolones). Gram-negative bacteria are the main cause of community and hospital-acquired urinary tract infections (UTI). We aimed to review and analyze the data on ciprofloxacin resistance in hospital and community-acquired UTI. A literature search of three electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane) was performed. We considered the papers that were published from January 2004 to May 2019. The search yielded a total of 16097 studies besides 31 studies from a manual search. Filtering yielded 1297 relevant full-text papers. Eighty-three papers, equivalent of 99 cohorts, were finally included in this systematic review and in the analysis. The analysis results suggest that pooled ciprofloxacin resistance for community and hospital-acquired E. coli UTI is 0.27 (95% CI 0.246-0.303) and 0.30 (95% CI 0.22-0.38), respectively. Pooled resistance rates according to regions are 0.43 (95% CI 0.31-0.54) for Asia ensued by Africa 0.31 (95% CI 0.22-0.35), the Middle East 0.21(95% CI 0.13-0.30), Europe 0.18 (95% CI 0.13-0.22), and Australia 0.06 (95% CI 0.04-0.08). The pooled estimates revealed that ciprofloxacin resistance was higher in developing countries compared to that in developed countries, 0.35 (95% CI 0.30-0.40) and 0.13 (95% CI 0.10-0.16), respectively. Finally, plotting resistance over time deemed statistically significant (n= 79, r= 0.29, p= 0.038). Our findings suggest that ciprofloxacin resistance among UTI patients is a highly prevalent and serious issue. The suggested risks are low-income, acquiring hospital infection, and falling in highly-vulnerable regions like Asia and Africa. We also shed light on some approaches to correct the perception of patients and general practitioners (GPs) for antibiotic usage. We also suggest ideas to impede the progress of the post-antibiotic era in countries known for high antibiotic resistance.",
