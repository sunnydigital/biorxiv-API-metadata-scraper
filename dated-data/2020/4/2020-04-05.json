    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2, emerged in 2019 from Hubei region in China and rapidly spread worldwide. As no approved therapeutics exists to treat Covid-19, the disease associated to SARS-Cov-2, there is an urgent need to propose molecules that could quickly enter into clinics. Repurposing of approved drugs is a strategy that can bypass the time consuming stages of drug development. In this study, we screened the Prestwick Chemical Library(R) composed of 1,520 approved drugs in an infected cell-based assay. 90 compounds were identified. The robustness of the screen was assessed by the identification of drugs, such as Chloroquine derivatives and protease inhibitors, already in clinical trials. The hits were sorted according to their chemical composition and their known therapeutic effect, then EC50 and CC50 were determined for a subset of compounds. Several drugs, such as Azithromycine, Opipramol, Quinidine or Omeprazol present antiviral potency with 2<EC50<20{micro}M. By providing new information on molecules inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 replication in vitro, this study could contribute to the short-term repurposing of drugs against Covid-19.",

    "abstract": "Human coronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 are respiratory pathogen of zoonotic origin that have gained worldwide distribution. OC43 apparently emerged from a bovine coronavirus (BCoV) spill-over. All three viruses attach to 9-O-acetylated sialoglycans via spike protein S with hemagglutinin-esterase HE acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. In BCoV, an HE lectin domain promotes esterase activity towards clustered substrates. OC43 and HKU1, however, lost HE lectin function as an adaptation to humans. Replaying OC43 evolution, we knocked-out BCoV HE lectin function and performed forced evolution-population dynamics analysis. Loss of HE receptor-binding selected for second-site mutations in S, decreasing S binding affinity by orders of magnitude. Irreversible HE mutations selected for cooperativity in virus swarms with low-affinity S minority variants sustaining propagation of high-affinity majority phenotypes. Salvageable HE mutations induced successive second-site substitutions in both S and HE. Apparently, S and HE are functionally interdependent and co-evolve to optimize the balance between attachment and release. This mechanism of glycan-based receptor usage, entailing a concerted, fine-tuned activity of two envelope protein species, is unique among CoVs, but reminiscent of that of influenza A viruses (IAVs). Apparently, general principles fundamental to virion-sialoglycan interactions prompted convergent evolution of two important groups of human and animal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The anti-malarial artemisinins have also been implicated in the regulation of various other cellular pathways. Despite their widespread application, the cellular specificities and molecular mechanisms of target recognition by artemisinins remain poorly characterized. We recently demonstrated how these drugs modulate inhibitory postsynaptic signaling by direct binding to the scaffolding protein gephyrin. Here, we report the crystal structure of the central metabolic enzyme pyridoxal kinase (PDXK), which catalyzes the production of the active form of vitamin-B6 (also known as pyridoxal 5-phosphate, PLP), in complex with artesunate at 2.4-[A] resolution. Partially overlapping binding of artemisinins with the substrate pyridoxal inhibits PLP biosynthesis as demonstrated by kinetic measurements. Electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal slices and activity measurements of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), a PLP-dependent enzyme synthesizing the neurotransmitter {gamma}-aminobutyric acid (GABA), define how artemisinins interfere presynaptically with GABAergic signaling. Our data provide a comprehensive picture of artemisinin-induced effects on inhibitory signaling in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Foraging is a vital behavioral task for living organisms. Behavioral strategies and abstract mathematical models thereof have been described in detail for various species. To explore the link between underlying nervous systems and abstract computational principles we present how a biologically detailed neural circuit model of the insect mushroom body implements sensory processing, learning and motor control. We focus on cast & surge strategies employed by flying insects when foraging within turbulent odor plumes. Using a synaptic plasticity rule the model rapidly learns to associate individual olfactory sensory cues paired with food in a classical conditioning paradigm. Without retraining, the system dynamically recalls memories to detect relevant cues in complex sensory scenes. Accumulation of this sensory evidence on short timescales generates cast & surge motor commands. Our systems approach is generic and predicts that population sparseness facilitates learning, while temporal sparseness is required for dynamic memory recall and precise behavioral control.",

    "abstract": "The broad use and misuse of prescription opioids during pregnancy has resulted in a surge of infants diagnosed with Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS). Short-term irritability and neurological complications are hallmarks of NOWS, but the long-term consequences are unknown. Our newly-developed preclinical model of oxycodone self-administration enables adult female rats to readily drink oxycodone (0.06-0.12 mg/ml, [~]10/mg/kg/day) continuously before and during pregnancy and after delivery, to achieve similar liquid intake in oxycodone moms relative to water-only controls. Oxycodone levels were detected in the serum of mothers and pups. Growth parameters in dams and pups, and litter mass and size were similar to controls. Maternal behavior at postnatal day 1 (PN1) was unchanged by perinatal oxycodone consumption. Regarding the plantar thermal response, there were no differences in paw retraction latency between oxycodone and control pups at PN2 or PN14. Oxycodone and control pups had similar motor coordination, cliff avoidance, righting time, pivoting, and olfactory spatial learning from PN3 through PN13. Separation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations at PN8 revealed higher call frequency in oxycodone pups relative to controls. Finally, during naltrexone precipitated withdrawal at PN9, oxycodone males vocalized more than control pups, consistent with a previously-published withdrawal phenotype. Thus, our rat model of continuous oral oxycodone self-administration in pregnancy shows exacerbated affect/social communication in pups in a sex-dependent manner but spared cognition and locomotion. Our preclinical, high face validity NOWS model reproduces key aspects of human opioid use during pregnancy, enabling longitudinal analysis of how maternal oxycodone changes emotional behavior in the offspring.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIFemale rats self-administered oxycodone at clinically relevant doses before and during pregnancy and for the first two weeks after parturition.\nC_LIO_LIBoth dams and pups, for the14 day postnatal experimental period, had detectable levels of oxycodone in their blood\nC_LIO_LIDams drinking oxycodone only or water only did not differ in weight gain, water intake, or the number of pups born and their pups did not differ in weight throughout.\nC_LIO_LISensory and motor function in the pups was not altered, nor was hippocampal dependent spatial learning.\nC_LIO_LIOxycodone exposed pups were physically dependent and displayed increased withdrawal behaviors with or without the opioid antagonist naltrexone.\nC_LIO_LIPups expressed more negative affect, expressed by increased ultrasonic vocalizations, following naltrexone precipitated withdrawal or when separated from their mother.\nC_LI",

Budding yeast is an unicellular organism characterised by a mother cell that buds to generate a daughter cell at each cell cycle. Each cell in a population buds at a different time. Despite its importance in biological applications, such as unravelling cell-cycle machinery mechanisms and production of valuable bioproducts, at present no yeast strain is capable of budding synchronously. To overcome this problem, we used control theory to propose a strategy to modify the yeast cell to endow it with the ability to synchronise its cell cycle across the population. Our strategy relies on a quorum sensing molecule diffusing freely in and out of the cell. The quorum sensing molecule is produced only during a specific phase of the cell cycle and couples the cell-cycle across the cell population. Here we model the proposed strategy with ordinary differential equations and numerically simulate it to demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach.",

Expression profiling of remaining BGC core genes and untargeted mass spectrometry did not identify products from uncharacterized BGCs. This platform strain was repurposed for expression of the recently identified polyketide calbistrin gene cluster and achieved high yields of decumbenone A, B and C.

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which is currently negatively affecting the population and disrupting the global economy. SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the +RNA virus family that utilize single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecules as genomes. SARS-CoV-2, like other coronaviruses, has an unusually large genome for a +RNA virus that encodes four structural proteins - the matrix (M), small envelope (E), spike (S) and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) - and sixteen nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16) that together ensure replication of the virus in the host cell. The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N is essential for linking the viral genome to the viral membrane. Its N-terminal RNA binding domain (N-NTD) captures the RNA genome while the C-terminal domain anchors the ribonucleoprotein complex to the viral membrane via its interaction with the M protein. Here, we characterized the structure of the N-NTD and its interaction with RNA using NMR spectroscopy. We observed a positively charged canyon on the surface of the N-NTD lined with arginine residues suggesting a putative RNA binding site. Next, we performed an NMR titration experiment using an RNA duplex. The observed changes in positions of signals in the N-NTD NMR spectra allowed us to construct a model of the N-NTD in complex with RNA.",

The receptor recognition of ACE2 protein by SARS-CoVs or bat-originated coronaviruses is one of the most important determinant factors for the cross-species transmission and human-to-human transmission. To explore the hypothesis of possible intermediate animal host, we employed molecular dynamics simulation and free energy calculation to examine the binding of bat coronavirus with ACE2 proteins of 47 representing animal species collected from public databases. Our results suggest that intermediate animal host may exist for the zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we found that tree shrew and ferret may be two putative intermediate hosts for the zoonotic spread of SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, the continuous surveillance of pneumonia in human and suspicious animal hosts are crucial to control the zoonotic transmission events caused by SARS-CoV-2.",

A plethora of analyses based on viral sequences has already been published, in scientific journals as well as through non-peer reviewed channels, to investigate SARS-CoV-2 genetic heterogeneity and spatiotemporal dissemination. We examined full genome sequences currently available to assess the presence of sufficient information for reliable phylogenetic and phylogeographic studies in countries with the highest toll of confirmed cases. Although number of-available full-genomes is growing daily, and the full dataset contains sufficient phylogenetic information that would allow reliable inference of phylogenetic relationships, country-specific SARS-CoV-2 datasets still present severe limitations. Studies assessing within country spread or transmission clusters should be considered preliminary at best, or hypothesis generating. Hence the need for continuing concerted efforts to increase number and quality of the sequences required for robust tracing of the epidemic.\n\nSignificance StatementAlthough genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 are growing daily and contain sufficient phylogenetic information, country-specific data still present severe limitations and should be interpreted with caution.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent necessity of effective medication against SARS CoV-2, which is producing the COVID-19 pandemic across the world. Its main protease (Mpro) represents an attractive pharmacological target due to its involvement in essential viral functions. The crystal structure of free Mpro shows a large structural resemblance with the main protease of SARS CoV (nowadays known as SARS CoV-1). Here we report that as average SARS CoV-2 Mpro is 1900% more sensitive than SARS CoV-1 Mpro in transmitting tiny structural changes across the whole protein through long-range interactions. The largest sensitivity of Mpro to structural perturbations is located exactly around the catalytic site Cys-145, and coincides with the binding site of strong inhibitors. These findings, based on a simplified representation of the protein as a residue network, may help in designing potent inhibitors of SARS CoV-2 Mpro.\n\nThe main protease of the new coronavirus SARS CoV-2 represents one of the most important targets for the antiviral pharmacological actions againsts COVID-19. This enzyme is essential for the virus due to its proteolytic processing of polyproteins. Here we discover that the main protease of SARS CoV-2 is topologically very similar to that of the SARS CoV-1. This is not surprising taking into account that both proteases differ only in 12 amino acids. However, we remarkable found a topological property of SARS CoV-2 that has increased in more than 1900% repect to its SARS CoV-1 analogue. This property reflects the capacity of the new protease of transmitting perturbations across its domains using long-range interactions. Also remarkable is the fact that the amino acids displaying such increased sensitivity to perturbations are around the binding site of the new protease, and close to its catalytic site. We also show that this sensititivy to perturbations is related to the effects of powerful protease inhibitors. In fact, the strongest inhibitors of the SARS CoV-2 main protease are those that produce the least change of this capacity of transmitting perturbations across the protein. We think that these findings may help in the design of new potent anti-SARS CoV-2 inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The biomass distribution across trophic levels (biomass pyramid), and cascading responses to perturbations (trophic cascades), are archetypal representatives of the interconnected set of static and dynamical properties of food chains. A vast literature has explored their respective ecological drivers, sometimes generating correlations between them. Here we instead reveal a fundamental connection: both pyramids and cascades reflect the dynamical sensitivity of the food chain to changes in species intrinsic rates. We deduce a direct relationship between cascades and pyramids, modulated by what we call trophic dissipation - a synthetic concept that encodes the contribution of top-down propagation of consumer losses in the biomass pyramid. Predictable across-ecosystem patterns emerge when systems are in similar regimes of trophic dissipation. Data from 31 aquatic mesocosm experiments demonstrate how our approach can reveal the causal mechanisms linking trophic cascades and biomass distributions, thus providing a road map to deduce reliable predictions from empirical patterns.",

    "abstract": "The cashmere goat (Capra hircus) is famous for the fine quality cashmere wool. The cashmere is produced by secondary hair follicle that the growth shows seasonal rhythm. Thus, in this study, the skin of cashmere goat was selected as a model to illustrate the circannual rhythm of skin. The whole length skin transcriptome mixed from selected four months was obtained by PacBio single-molecule long-read sequencing (SMRT) technology. We generated 82,382 high quality non-redundant transcripts belonging to 193,310 genes, including 4,237 novel genes. Other 39 skin transcriptomes sampled from Dec. 2014 to Dec. 2015 were sequenced by Illumina Hi-Seq2500, we found 980 genes were differentially expressed. Of these genes, 403 seasonal rhythm genes (SRGs) were expressed and exhibited a seasonal pattern in skin. The results also showed that miRNAs were differentially expressed as the daylight length changed throughout a year. Some SRG genes related to the hormone secretion and eyes morphogenesis were enriched in skin. These genes gradually increased their expression level under short light, reached the peak near the summer solstice, and then began to decline. We found that the expression of Dio1 gene may be affected by the photoperiod that induces transformation from the inactive T4 to active thyroid hormone T3 in the skin and led to the difference between the skin circannual rhythm and the core circannual rhythm. Furthermore, the skin expressed eye morphogenesis-related genes and miRNAs, which suggested some cells in the skin could have the potential of light sensitivity. These results revealed that SRGs could regulate the downstream gene expression and physiological process in the skin to adapt to the season change.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are innate immune cells that contribute to fighting infections, tissue repair, and maintaining tissue homeostasis. To enable such functional diversity, macrophages resolve potentially conflicting cues in the microenvironment via mechanisms that remain unclear. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to explore how individual macrophages respond when co-stimulated with the inflammatory stimuli, LPS+IFN-{gamma}, and the resolving cytokine, IL-4. We found that co-stimulated macrophages displayed a distinct global transcriptional program. However, variable negative cross-regulation between some LPS+IFN-{gamma}- and IL-4-specific genes resulted in significant cell-to-cell heterogeneity in transcription. Interestingly, negative cross-regulation led to mutually exclusive expression of the T-cell-polarizing cytokines Il6 and Il12b versus the IL-4-associated factors Arg1 and Chil3 in single co-stimulated macrophages, and single-cell secretion measurements showed that these specialized functions were maintained for at least 48 hours. Overall, our study suggests that increasing functional diversity in the population is one strategy macrophages use to respond to conflicting environmental cues.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiome targets for type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention among human cohorts have been controversial. Using an interpretable machine learning-based analytic framework, we identified robust human gut microbiome features, with their optimal threshold, in predicting T2D. Based on the results, we constructed a microbiome risk score (MRS), which was consistently associated with T2D across 3 independent Chinese cohorts involving 9111 participants (926 T2D cases). The MRS could also predict future glucose increment, and was correlated with a variety of gut microbiota-derived blood metabolites. Faecal microbiota transplantation from humans to germ-free mice demonstrated a causal role of the identified combination of microbes in the T2D development. We further identified adiposity and dietary factors which could prospectively modulate the MRS, and found that body fat distribution may be the key factor modulating the gut microbiome-T2D relationship. Taken together, we proposed a new analytical framework for the investigation of microbiome-disease relationship. The identified microbiota may serve as potential drug targets for T2D in future.",

    "abstract": "Alpha-7-nicotine-acetylcholine-receptor (7-nAChRs) agonists modulate the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway to attenuate proinflammatory signals and reduce dopaminergic neuronal cell loss in toxin-induced experimental murine models of Parkinsons disease (PD). The protein -synuclein (Syn) is considered to represent the major pathogenic component in the etiology and progression of sporadic PD. However, no research has been performed to evaluate the effect of 7-nAChR agonists in human Syn mediated models of PD. We, therefore, investigated the effect of the compound JN403, an 7-nAChR specific agonist, in Syn treated in vitro microglia culture and in a human Syn overexpression in vivo mouse model. In primary mouse microglia cells, Syn fragment 61-140 treatment increased the release of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-6, and decreased cell viability. In contrast, 100 nM or 1 M of JN403 co-incubation significantly reduced the level of NO and TNF- release in the microglial cells. For in-vivo testing of JN403, a recombinant adeno-associated viral vector (rAAV)-mediated unilateral intranigral overexpression of human wild-type-Syn (WT-Syn) or of the control protein luciferase (luc) was induced via stereotactic delivery in C57/BL6N mice. Targeted WT-Syn overexpression reduced 20% of the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive (+) nigral neurons after 10 weeks. Subcutaneous daily treatment of 30 mg/kg JN403 over 9 weeks starting at postoperative week 1 did not alter the decrease of TH+ neuronal numbers, and microglial density in WT-Syn overexpression mouse model. The reduced density of TH+ striatal terminals in the WT-Syn groups was also not recovered by the JN403 treatment. In summary, JN403, an 7-nAChR specific agonist shows a beneficial effect on ameliorating proinflammatory signals in Syn exposed microglia cells. However, no significant in-vivo treatment effect was found in an intranigral WT-Syn overexpression mouse model of PD.",

    "abstract": "People often adapt their coordination patterns during walking to reduce energy cost by using sources of external assistance in the environment. Adaptation to walking on a split-belt treadmill, where one belt moves faster than the other, provides an opportunity for people to acquire positive work from the treadmill to reduce metabolic cost by modifying where they step on the faster belt. Though we know what people should do to acquire this assistance, this strategy is not observed during typical adaptation studies. Here, by extending the duration of adaptation, we show that people continuously optimize energetic cost by adjusting foot placement to acquire positive work from the treadmill and reduce the work performed by the legs. These results demonstrate that learning to acquire and take advantage of assistance to reduce energetic cost is central in shaping adaptive locomotion, but this process occurs over timescales longer than those used in typical studies.",

We previously demonstrated that four nucleotide analogues (specifically, the active triphosphate forms of Sofosbuvir, Alovudine, AZT and Tenofovir alafenamide) inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Tenofovir and emtricitabine are the two components in DESCOVY and TRUVADA, the two FDA-approved medications for use as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV infection. This is a preventative method in which individuals who are HIV negative (but at high-risk of contracting the virus) take the combination drug daily to reduce the chance of becoming infected with HIV. PrEP can stop HIV from replicating and spreading throughout the body. We report here that the triphosphates of tenofovir and emtricitabine, the two components in DESCOVY and TRUVADA, act as terminators for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp catalyzed reaction.

    "abstract": "The recent outbreak by SARS-CoV-2 has generated a chaos in global health and economy and claimed/infected a large number of lives. Closely resembling with SARS CoV, the present strain has manifested exceptionally higher degree of spreadability, virulence and stability possibly due to some unidentified mutations. The viral spike glycoprotein is very likely to interact with host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmits its genetic materials and hijacks host machinery with extreme fidelity for self propagation. Few attempts have been made to develop a suitable vaccine or ACE2 blocker or virus-receptor inhibitor within this short period of time. Here, attempt was taken to develop some therapeutic and vaccination strategies with a comparison of spike glycoproteins among SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the SARS-CoV-2. We verified their structure quality (SWISS-MODEL, Phyre2, Pymol) topology (ProFunc), motifs (MEME Suite, GLAM2Scan), gene ontology based conserved domain (InterPro database) and screened several epitopes (SVMTrip) of SARS CoV-2 based on their energetics, IC50 and antigenicity with regard to their possible glycosylation and MHC/paratopic binding (Vaxigen v2.0, HawkDock, ZDOCK Server) effects. We screened here few pairs of spike protein epitopic regions and selected their energetic, IC50, MHC II reactivity and found some of those to be very good target for vaccination. A possible role of glycosylation on epitopic region showed profound effects on epitopic recognition. The present work might be helpful for the urgent development of a suitable vaccination regimen against SARS CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) parenchyma is enclosed by anatomical interfaces including multilayered meninges, the blood-brain barrier (BBB), the choroid plexuses within ventricles and the glia limitans. These border areas hold distinct functional specializations which control the trafficking of monocyte-derived cells toward the CNS parenchyma, altogether maintaining CNS homeostasis. By crossing activated endothelial, epithelial and glial borders, circulating leukocytes gain however access to the CNS parenchyma in several inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis.\n\nStudies in animal models of neuroinflammation have helped describing the phenotypic specifications of these invading monocyte-derived cells, able to exert detrimental or beneficial functions depending on the local environment. In this context, in vivo visualization of iNOS+ pro-inflammatory and arginase-1+ anti-inflammatory macrophages has recently revealed that these distinct cell phenotypes are highly compartmentalized by CNS borders. While arginase-1+ macrophages densely populate the leptomeninges, iNOS+ macrophages rather accumulate in perivascular spaces and at the pia mater-CNS parenchymal interface.\n\nHow and where these macrophages acquire their functional commitment, and whether differentially-activated monocyte-derived cells infiltrate the CNS through distinct gateways, remains however unclear.\n\nIn this study, we have investigated the interaction of monocyte-derived macrophages with endothelial (BBB) and epithelial (choroid plexus) barriers of the CNS, both in vitro and in vivo. By using primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells as in vitro model of the BBB, we observed that, compared to unpolarized primary macrophages, adhesion of functionally-committed macrophages to endothelial cells was drastically reduced, literally abrogating their diapedesis across the BBB. Conversely, when interacting with an activated choroid plexus epithelium, both pro- and anti-inflammatory macrophages displayed substantial adhesive and migratory properties. Accordingly, in vivo analysis of choroid plexuses revealed increased macrophage trafficking and a scattered presence of polarized cells upon induction of anti-CNS inflammation.\n\nAltogether, we show that acquisition of distinct macrophage polarizations significantly alters the adhesive and migratory properties of these cells in a barrier-specific fashion. While monocytes trafficking at the level of the BBB seem to acquire their signature phenotype only following diapedesis, other anatomical interfaces can be the entry site for functionally activated monocyte-derived cells. Our study highlights the choroid plexus as a key access gateway for macrophages during neuroinflammation, and its stroma as a potential priming site for their functional polarization.",

There are two kinds of friction: the first contact that leads to static friction and the dragging phase that leads to dynamic friction. No study has been performed to show the effect of friction type on EEG signals. The main goal of the current study is to investigate the effect of tactile friction on non-linear features of EEG signals.\n\nParticipants performed a tactile task that each of its trials had three states: the sensation of 1) static friction, 2) dynamic friction, and 3) no friction. During the experiment, EEG signals were recorded, and different linear and non-linear EEG indices were extracted and analyzed to find the effect of the tactile friction on EEG signals.\n\nLinear features such as spectral features were not a good choice to distinguish between the states. However, non-linear features such as Lyapunov exponent, Higuchis dimension, and Hurst exponent had the potential to separate the mentioned states. Results also showed signs of predictability (negative Lyapunov exponent) in the signals recorded during dynamic friction and the existence of long-range dependency (memory) in EEG signals recorded during all states. The complexity of the tactile system in Theta band was also higher than the Delta band. The results of this research not only increase our knowledge about brain non-linear dynamics in response to tactile friction but also lead to a design of a preliminary system that can automatically detect friction between the skin and surfaces.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM) is a major cause of food-borne gastroenteritis. Recent outbreaks of infections by STM are often associated with non-animal related food, i.e. vegetables, fruits, herbs, sprouts and nuts. One main problem related to consumption of fresh produce is the minimal processing, especially for leafy salads such as corn salad, rocket salad, or lettuce. In this study, we focused on lettuce (Lactuca sativa) which is contaminated by STM at higher rates compared to corn salad, resulting in prolonged persistence. We previously described the contribution of Saf fimbriae, type 1 secretion system (T1SS)-secreted BapA, intact LPS, and flagella-mediated motility to adhesion to corn salad leaves. We systematically analyzed factors contributing to adhesion of STM to lettuce leaves. We used the previously established reductionist, synthetic approach to identify factors that contribute to the surface binding of STM to leaves of lettuce by expressing all known adhesive structure by the Tet-on system. The analyses revealed contributions of Lpf fimbriae, Sti fimbriae, autotransported adhesin MisL, T1SS-secreted BapA, intact LPS, and flagella-mediated motility to adhesion of STM to lettuce leaves. In addition, we identified BapA is a potential adhesin involved in binding to corn salad and lettuce leaf surfaces.\n\nImportanceGastrointestinal pathogens can be transmitted by animal products, as well as by fresh produce of non-animal origin. The numbers of outbreaks by fresh produce contaminated with gastrointestinal pathogens are increasing, and underline the relevance to human health. The mechanisms involved in the colonization of, persistence on, and transmission by fresh produce are poorly understood and have to be part of further research. Here, we investigated the contribution of adhesive factors of STM in the initial phase of plant colonization, i.e. the binding to the plant surface. Usage of a reductionist, synthetic approach including the controlled surface expression of specific adhesive structures of STM, one at a time, allowed the determination of relevant fimbrial and non-fimbrial adhesins, the O-antigen of lipopolysaccharide, the flagella, and chemotaxis to binding to lettuce leaves.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus currently causing a pandemic. We show that the majority of amino acid positions, which differ between SARS-CoV-2 and the closely related SARS-CoV, are differentially conserved suggesting differences in biological behaviour. In agreement, novel cell culture models revealed differences between the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Moreover, cellular ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) and TMPRSS2 (enables virus entry via S protein cleavage) levels did not reliably indicate cell susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV further differed in their drug sensitivity profiles. Thus, only drug testing using SARS-CoV-2 reliably identifies therapy candidates. Therapeutic concentrations of the approved protease inhibitor aprotinin displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. The efficacy of aprotinin and of remdesivir (currently under clinical investigation against SARS-CoV-2) were further enhanced by therapeutic concentrations of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole (aprotinin 2.7-fold, remdesivir 10-fold). Hence, our study has also identified anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy candidates that can be readily tested in patients.",

Resources essential to monitoring virus transmission have been challenged with a demand for expanded surveillance. The CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time Diagnostic Panel uses a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) consisting of two TaqMan probe and primer sets specific for the 2019-nCoV N gene, which codes for the nucleocapsid structural protein that encapsulates viral RNA, for the qualitative detection of 2019-nCoV viral RNA in respiratory samples. To isolate RNA from respiratory samples, the CDC lists RNA extraction kits from four manufacturers. In anticipation of a limited supply chain of RNA extraction kits and the need for test scalability, we sought to identify alternative RNA extraction methods. Here we show that direct lysis of respiratory samples can be used in place of RNA extraction kits to run the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time Diagnostic assay with the additional benefits of higher throughput, lower cost, faster turnaround and possibly higher sensitivity and improved safety.",

    "abstract": "The 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is a pathogen of critical significance to international public health. Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable \"choke points\" for pharmacologic interventions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate patient outcomes. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce and iteratively refine a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung tissue. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and an online interactive model in under 12 hours, and community domain expertise is driving regular refinements. In a sustained community effort, this consortium is integrating data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health. More broadly, this effort is creating a reusable, modular framework for studying viral replication and immune response in tissues, which can also potentially be adapted to related problems in immunology and immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting rare variants remains a challenge in personal genomics, especially for disorders with several causal genes and for genes that cause multiple disorders. ZNF423 encodes a transcriptional regulatory protein that intersects several developmental pathways. ZNF423 has been implicated in rare neurodevelopmental disorders, consistent with midline brain defects in Zfp423-mutant mice, but pathogenic potential of most patient variants remains uncertain. We engineered ~50 patient-derived and small deletion variants into the highly-conserved mouse ortholog and examined neuroanatomical measures for 791 littermate pairs. Three substitutions previously asserted pathogenic appeared benign, while a fourth was effectively null. Heterozygous premature termination codon (PTC) variants showed mild haploabnormality, consistent with loss-of-function intolerance inferred from human population data. In-frame deletions of specific zinc fingers showed mild to moderate abnormalities, as did low-expression variants. These results affirm the need for functional validation of rare variants in biological context and demonstrate cost-effective modeling of neuroanatomical abnormalities in mice.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYGene identification in rare disorders is typically supported by finding different mutations of the same gene in multiple families with the same disorder. However, causal evidence for any specific mutation found in one or a few related individuals is weaker, especially if the disorder can be caused by any of several genes and the functional effect of the mutation is not certain. Experimental models can be helpful in testing causal effects, but only to the extent that the model is validated to recapitulate one or more aspects of the disorder. We used CRISPR/Cas9-based genome engineering to create a wide range of mutations in mouse Zfp423, whose human cognate is implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, especially cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and Joubert syndrome. This large collection of animal models shows that both reduced Zfp423 expression, including heterozygosity for loss-of-function mutations, and normally-expressed domain deletions, including specific zinc finger domains, produce measureable abnormalities in midline development. Despite this high level of validation, most patient-derived amino acid substitution variants tested do not produce measureable effects. The single exception is a substitution, H1277Y, that destroys a structural element in the last zinc finger domain and results in dramatic loss of steady-state Zfp423 protein level.",

    "abstract": "The diaphragm is a mammalian muscle critical for respiration and separation of the thoracic and abdominal cavities. Defects in the development of the diaphragm are the cause of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), a common birth defect. In CDH, weaknesses in the developing diaphragm allow abdominal contents to herniate into the thoracic cavity and impair lung development, leading to a high neonatal mortality. The genetic etiology of CDH is complex. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertion/deletions (indels), and structural/copy number variants in more than 150 genes have been associated with CDH, although few genes are recurrently mutated in multiple patients and recurrently mutated genes can be incompletely penetrant. This suggests that multiple genetic variants in combination, other not yet investigated classes of variants, and/or nongenetic factors contribute to CDH susceptibility. However, to date no studies have comprehensively investigated the contribution of all possible classes of variants throughout the genome to the etiology of CDH. In our study, we used a unique cohort of four patients with isolated CDH with samples from blood, skin, and diaphragm connective tissue and parental blood samples and deep whole genome sequencing to assess germline and somatic de novo and inherited variants of various sizes (SNVs, indels, and structural variants) in exons, introns, UTRs, and intergenic regions. In each patient we found a different mutational landscape that included germline de novo, and inherited SNVs and indels in multiple genes. We also found in two patients an inherited 343 bp deletion interrupting an annotated enhancer of the CDH associated gene, GATA4, and we hypothesize that this common deletion (found in 1-2% of the population) acts as a sensitizing allele for CDH. Overall, our comprehensive reconstruction of the genetic architecture of four CDH individuals demonstrates that the etiology of CDH is heterogeneous and multifactorial.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDeep whole genome sequencing of family trios shows that etiology of congenital diaphragmatic hernias is heterogeneous and multifactorial.",

    "abstract": "Cassava has been found to carry high levels of recessive deleterious mutations and it is known to suffer from inbreeding depression. Breeders therefore consider specific approaches to decrease cassavas genetic load. Using self fertilization to unmask deleterious recessive alleles and therefore accelerate their purging is one possibility. Before implementation of this approach we sought to understand better its consequences through simulation. Founder populations with high directional dominance were simulated using a natural selection forward simulator. The founder population was then subjected to five generations of genomic selection in schemes that did or did not include a generation of phenotypic selection on selfed progeny. We found that genomic selection was less effective under the directional dominance model than under the additive models that have commonly been used in simulations. While selection did increase favorable allele frequencies, increased inbreeding during selection caused decreased gain in genotypic values under the directional dominance. While purging selection on selfed individuals was effective in the first breeding cycle, it was not effective in later cycles, an effect we attributed to the fact that the generation of selfing decreased the relatedness of the genomic prediction training population from selection candidates. That decreased relatedness caused genomic prediction accuracy to be lower in schemes incorporating selfing. We found that selection on individuals partially inbred by one generation of selfing did increase mean genetic value of the partially inbred population, but that this gain was accompanied by a relatively small increase in favorable allele frequencies such that improvement in the outbred population was lower than might have been intuited.",

    "abstract": "Native tropical forests hold high levels of diversity, challenging forest restoration of large areas in a global change scenario. For a site-specific restoration is required the understanding of the main influences ruling the assemblages. We aimed to answer three questions. 1) how do environmental variables influence taxonomic, phylogenetic diversities, and the phylogenetic structure in the of Rio Doce Basin (TFRD)? 2) How do environmental variables, phylogenetic structure and the main types of seed dispersal relate to each other? 3) Which information of the TFRD assemblages can be used for ecological restoration and conservation? We used 78 sites with their checklists to calculate taxonomic, and phylogenetic diversities, phylogenetic structures, and dispersal proportions. Then, we related the diversities of the sites to their bioclimatic variables and built GLM models. Species richness was influenced negatively by water excess duration, by water deficit duration, and positively by maximum temperature, and temperature seasonality. Water regime drives diversity and phylogenetic community structure in the TFRD more than other variables. Annual precipitation and maximum temperature presented the clearer influences on diversity and phylogenetic structure. Zoochory was positively, and anemochory, autochory were negatively related to sesMPD. By choosing the lineages with high fitness for each site, the functioning and the stability of ecosystems should increase. The addition of species with anemochory and autochory increases functional and phylogenetic diversity in areas with extreme water excess or water deficit, important in a global change scenario. A high proportion of zoochory allows the communities to function conserving dispersers, biodiversity, and services.\n\nImplications for practiceO_LIThe use of objective methods based on community assembly rules enhances the choice of species, and of phylogenetic lineages better fitted to the bioclimatic profiles of the areas to be restored, improving the functioning and stability of the restored forests.\nC_LIO_LIThe water purification service should be improved through forest restoration as much as possible because ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation are co-benefits of restored forests.\nC_LIO_LIThe inclusion of species with anemochory, and autochory in forest restoration practices should become usual, as they increase functional, and phylogenetic diversities, and as a consequence, the ecosystem stability.\nC_LIO_LIA large proportion of species with zoochory in restored forests co-benefits taxonomic diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and ecosystem stability.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Despite ongoing malaria control efforts implemented throughout sub-Saharan Africa, malaria remains an enormous public health concern. Current interventions such as indoor residual spraying with insecticides and use of insecticide-treated bed nets are aimed at targeting the key malaria vectors that are primarily endophagic and endophilic. While these control measures have resulted in a substantial decline in malaria cases and continue to impact indoor transmission, the importance of alternative vectors for malaria transmission has been largely neglected. Anopheles coustani, an understudied vector of malaria, is a species previously thought to exhibit mostly zoophilic behavior. However, recent studies from across Africa bring to light the contribution of this and ecologically similar anopheline species to human malaria transmission. Like many of these understudied species, An. coustani has greater anthropophilic tendencies than previously appreciated, is often both endophagic and exophagic, and carries Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites. These recent developments highlight the need for more studies throughout the geographic range of this species and the potential need to control this vector. The aim of this study was to explore the genetic variation of An. coustani mosquitoes and the potential of this Anopheles species to contribute to malaria parasite transmission in high transmission settings in Nchelenge District, Zambia, and the Kashobwe and Kilwa Health Zones in Haut-Katanga Province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Morphologically identified An. coustani specimens that were trapped outdoors in these study sites were analyzed by PCR and sequencing for species identification and blood meal sources, and malaria parasite infection was determined by ELISA and qPCR. Fifty specimens were confirmed to be An. coustani by the analysis of mitochondrial DNA cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS2). Further, maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis of COI and ITS2 sequences revealed two distinct phylogenetic groups within this relatively small regional collection. Our findings indicate that both An. coustani groups have anthropophilic and exophagic habits and come into frequent contact with P. falciparum, suggesting that this potential alternative malaria vector might elude current vector controls in Northern Zambia and Southern DRC. This study sets the groundwork for more thorough investigations of bionomic characteristics and genetic diversity of An. coustani and its contribution to malaria transmission in these regions.",

    "abstract": "Rapid and widespread implementation of infectious disease surveillance is a critical component in the response to novel health threats. Molecular assays are the preferred method to detect a broad range of pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity. The implementation of molecular assay testing in a rapidly evolving public health emergency can be hindered by resource availability or technical constraints. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the applicability of a pooled-sample testing protocol to screen large populations more rapidly and with limited resources is discussed. A Bayesian inference analysis in which hierarchical testing stages can have different sensitivities is implemented and benchmarked against early COVID-19 testing data. Optimal pool size and increases in throughput and case detection are calculated as a function of disease prevalence. Even for moderate losses in test sensitivity upon pooling, substantial increases in testing throughput and detection efficiency are predicted, suggesting that sample pooling is a viable avenue to circumvent current testing bottlenecks for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Endophytes are microbial colonizers that reside in plants by symbiotic association produces several biological classes of natural products. The current study focuses on the isolation and characterization of bioactive compounds produced by endophytic fungi isolated from the Himalayan yew (Taxus wallichiana) collected from the Mustang district of Nepal. The plant materials were collected from the Lower-Mustang region in the month of October 2016 and the endophytic fungi were isolated on artificial media from inner tissues of bark and needles. Antimicrobial and antioxidant activity, along with total phenolic- and flavonoid-content assays, were used in the evaluation of bioactivity of the fermented crude extracts along with the in vitro ability of the endophytes to produce the anticancer compound Taxol was analyzed. A total of 16 fungal morphotypes were obtained from asymptomatic inner tissues of the bark and needles of T. wallichiana. Among the 16 isolates, the ethyl acetate (EA) fraction of isolate MUS1, showed antibacterial and antifungal activity against all test-pathogens used, with significant inhibition against Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (MIC: 250 {micro}g/ml) and the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans (MIC: 125 {micro}g/ml). Antioxidant activity was also evaluated using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). At a concentration of 100 {micro}g/ml, the % radical scavenging activity was 83.15{+/-}0.40, 81.62{+/-}0.11, and 62.36{+/-}0.29, for ascorbic acid, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and the EA fraction of MUS1, respectively. The DPPH-IC50 value for the EA fraction was 81.52 {micro}g/ml, compared to BHT (62.87 {micro}g/ml) and ascorbic acid (56.15 {micro}g/ml). The total phenolic and flavonoid content in the EA fraction were 16.90{+/-}0.075 {micro}g gallic acid equivalent (GAE) and 11.59{+/-}0.148 {micro}g rutin equivalent (RE), per mg of dry crude extract, respectively. Isolate MUS1, identified as an Annulohypoxylon sp. by ITS sequencing, also produced Taxol (282.05 {micro}g/L) as shown by TLC and HPLC analysis. Having the ability to produce antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds, as well as the anticancer compound Taxol, makes Annulohypoxylon sp. strain MUS1, a promising candidate for further study given that naturally occurring bioactive compounds are of great interest to the pharmacological, food and cosmetic industries.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is already responsible for far more deaths than previous pathogenic coronaviruses (CoVs) from 2002 and 2012. The identification of clinically approved drugs to be repurposed to combat 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19) would allow the rapid implementation of potentially life-saving procedures. The major protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is considered a promising target, based on previous results from related CoVs with lopinavir (LPV), an HIV protease inhibitor. However, limited evidence exists for other clinically approved antiretroviral protease inhibitors, such as atazanavir (ATV). ATV is of high interest because of its bioavailability within the respiratory tract. Our results show that ATV could dock in the active site of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, with greater strength than LPV. ATV blocked Mpro activity. We confirmed that ATV inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication, alone or in combination with ritonavir (RTV) in Vero cells, human pulmonary epithelial cell line and primary monocytes, impairing virus-induced enhancement of IL-6 and TNF- levels. Together, our data strongly suggest that ATV and ATV/RTV should be considered among the candidate repurposed drugs undergoing clinical trials in the fight against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "C3A is a sub-clone of human hepatoblastoma HepG2 cell line with the strong contact inhibition of growth. We fortuitously found that C3A was more susceptible to human coronavirus HCoV-OC43 infection than HepG2, which was attributed to the increased efficiency of virus entry into C3A cells. In an effort to search for the host cellular protein(s) mediating the differential susceptibility of the two cell lines to HCoV-OC43 infection, we found that ADAP2, GILT and LY6E, three cellular proteins with known activity of interfering virus entry, expressed at significantly higher levels in HepG2 cells. Functional analyses revealed that ectopic expression of LY6E, but not GILT or ADAP2, in HEK 293 cells inhibited the entry of HCoV-OC43. While overexpression of LY6E in C3A and A549 cells efficiently inhibited the infection of HCoV-OC43, knockdown of LY6E expression in HepG2 significantly increased its susceptibility to HCoV-OC43 infection. Moreover, we found that LY6E also efficiently restricted the entry mediated by the envelope spike proteins of other human coronaviruses, including the currently pandemic SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, overexpression of serine protease TMPRSS2 or amphotericin treatment significantly neutralized the IFITM3 restriction of human coronavirus entry, but did not compromise the effect of LY6E on the entry of human coronaviruses. The work reported herein thus demonstrates that LY6E is a critical antiviral immune effector that controls CoV infection and pathogenesis via a distinct mechanism.\n\nImportanceVirus entry into host cells is one of the key determinants of host range and cell tropism and is subjected to the control by host innate and adaptive immune responses. In the last decade, several interferon inducible cellular proteins, including IFITMs, GILT, ADAP2, 25CH and LY6E, had been identified to modulate the infectious entry of a variety of viruses. Particularly, LY6E was recently identified as host factors to facilitate the entry of several human pathogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A virus and yellow fever virus. Identification of LY6E as a potent restriction factor of coronaviruses expands the biological function of LY6E and sheds new light on the immunopathogenesis of human coronavirus infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe outbreak of SARS CoV-2 has caused ever-increasing attention and public panic all over the world. Currently, there is no specific treatment against the SARS CoV-2. Therefore, identifying effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. Previous studies found that indomethacin has the ability to inhibit the replication of several unrelated DNA and RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV.\n\nMethodsSARS CoV-2 pseudovirus-infected African green monkey kidney VERO E6 cells treated with different concentrations of indomethacin or aspirin at 48 hours post infection (p.i). The level of cell infection was determined by luciferase activity. Anti-coronavirus efficacy in vivo was confirmed by evaluating the time of recovery in canine coronavirus (CCV) infected dogs treated orally with 1mg/kg body weight indomethacin.\n\nResultsWe found that indomethacin has a directly and potently antiviral activity against the SARS CoV-2 pseudovirus (reduce relative light unit to zero). In CCV-infected dogs, recovery occurred significantly sooner with symptomatic treatment + oral indomethacin (1 mg/kg body weight) daily treatments than with symptomatic treatment + ribavirin (10-15 mg/kg body weight) daily treatments (P =0.0031), but was not significantly different from that with symptomatic treatment + anti-canine coronavirus serum + canine hemoglobin + canine blood immunoglobulin + interferon treatments (P =0.7784).\n\nConclusionThe results identify indomethacin as a potent inhibitor of SARS CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Different fasting regimens are known to promote health, mitigate chronic immunological disorders, and improve age-related pathophysiological parameters in animals and humans. Indeed, several clinical trials are currently ongoing using fasting as a potential therapy for a wide range of conditions. Fasting alters metabolism by acting as a reset for energy homeostasis. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of short-term fasting (STF) are still not well understood, particularly at the systems or multi-organ level. Here, we investigated the dynamic gene expression patterns associated with six periods of STF in nine different mouse organs. We cataloged the transcriptional dynamics within and between organs during STF and discovered differential temporal effects of STF among organs. Using gene ontology enrichment analysis, we identified an organ network sharing 37 common biological pathways perturbed by STF. This network incorporates the brain, liver, interscapular brown adipose tissue, and posterior-subcutaneous white adipose tissue, hence we named it the brain-liver-fats organ network. Using Reactome pathways analysis, we identified the immune system, dominated by T cell regulation processes, as a central and prominent target of systemic modulations during STF in this organ network. The changes we identified in specific immune components point to the priming of adaptive immunity and parallel the fine-tuning of innate immune signaling. Our study provides a comprehensive multi-organ transcriptomic profiling of mice subjected to multiple periods of STF, and adds new insights into the molecular modulators involved in the systemic immuno-transcriptomic changes that occur during short-term energy loss.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive anaerobic intestinal pathogenic bacterium and the causative agent of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and spores are the transmission vehicle of the disease. In C. difficile spores, the outermost exosporium layer is the first barrier of interaction with the host and should carry spore ligands involved in spore-host interactions. C. difficile forms two types of spores (i.e., thin and thick exosporium layers). In this communication, we contribute to understand several biological aspects of these two exosporium morphotypes. By transmission electron microscopy, we demonstrate that both exosporium morphotypes appear simultaneously during sporulation and that the laminations of the spore-coat are formed under anaerobic conditions. Nycodenz density-gradient allows enrichment of spores with a thick-exosporium layer morphotype and presence of polar appendage. Using translational fluorescent fusions with exosporium proteins BclA3, CdeA, CdeC and CdeM as well as with several spore coat proteins, we observed that expression intensity and distribution of SNAP-translational fusions in R20291 strain is highly heterogeneous. Electron micrographs demonstrate that multicopy expression of CdeC, but not CdeM, SNAP translational fusion, increases the abundance of the thick exosporium morphotype. Collectively, these results raise further questions on how these distinctive exosporium morphotypes are made during spore formation.",
