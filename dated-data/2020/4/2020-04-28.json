    "abstract": "The ubiquitous redox coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) acts as a non-canonical cap structure on prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribonucleic acids. Here we find that in budding yeast, NAD-RNAs are abundant (>1400 species), short (<170 nt), and mostly correspond to mRNA 5-ends. The modification percentage is low (<5%). NAD is incorporated during the initiation step by RNA polymerase II, which uses distinct promoters with a YAAG core motif for this purpose. Most NAD-RNAs are 3-truncated. At least three decapping enzymes, Rai1, Dxo1, and Npy1, guard against NAD-RNA at different cellular locations, targeting overlapping transcript populations. NAD-mRNAs do not support translation in vitro. Our work indicates that in budding yeast, most of the NAD incorporation into RNA seems to be accidental and undesirable to the cell, which has evolved a diverse surveillance machinery to prematurely terminate, decap and reject NAD-RNAs.\n\nIn BriefIn budding yeast, most of the NAD incorporation into RNA seems to be accidental and undesirable to the cell, which has evolved a diverse surveillance machinery to prematurely terminate, decap and reject NAD-RNAs.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/065920v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19b86f4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b923f3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e74f69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10e787f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIYeast cells have thousands of short NAD-RNAs related to the 5-ends of mRNAs\nC_LIO_LIRNA polymerase II prefers a YAAG promoter motif for NAD incorporation into RNA\nC_LIO_LINAD-RNA is strongly guarded against by Rai1, Dxo1, and Npy1 decapping enzymes at different subcellular sites\nC_LIO_LIIn vitro, NAD-mRNAs are rejected from translation\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In vitro experiments have shown GRASP65 (GORASP1) and GRASP55 (GORASP2) proteins function in stacking Golgi cisternae. However, in vivo depletion of GORASPs in metazoans have given equivocal results. We have generated a mouse lacking both GORASPs and find that Golgi cisternae remained stacked. However, the stacks are disconnected laterally from each other and the cisternal cross-sectional diameters are significantly reduced compared to their normal counterparts. These data support earlier findings on the role of GORASPs in linking stacks and we suggest that unlinking of stacks affects dynamic control of COPI budding and vesicle fusion at the rims. The net result is that cisternal cores remain stacked, but cisternal diameter is reduced by rim consumption.",

The therapeutic efficacy of cardiosphere-derived cells (CDCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is associated with extracellular vesicle (EV) release. Despite differences in cell origin, it is unclear why EVs elicit differences in therapeutic potency between cell types. Here, we compare EVs derived from multiple MSC and CDC donors. We reveal that EV membrane protein and microRNA (miR) composition are reflective of their parent cell. Small RNA-sequencing revealed enrichment of miR-10b in MSC EVs. Our data support the hypothesis that CDC EVs are distinct from MSC-EVs and is reflected by their miR composition.",

    "abstract": "Human DNA-methylation data have been used to develop biomarkers of ageing - referred to  epigenetic clocks - that have been widely used to identify differences between chronological age and biological age in health and disease including neurodegeneration, dementia and other brain phenotypes. Existing DNA methylation clocks are highly accurate in blood but are less precise when used in older samples or on brain tissue. We aimed to develop a novel epigenetic clock that performs optimally in human cortex tissue and has the potential to identify phenotypes associated with biological ageing in the brain. We generated an extensive dataset of human cortex DNA methylation data spanning the life-course (n = 1,397, ages = 1 to 104 years). This dataset was split into  training and  testing samples (training: n = 1,047; testing: n = 350). DNA methylation age estimators were derived using a transformed version of chronological age on DNA methylation at specific sites using elastic net regression, a supervised machine learning method. The cortical clock was subsequently validated in a novel human cortex dataset (n = 1,221, ages = 41 to 104 years) and tested for specificity in a large whole blood dataset (n = 1,175, ages = 28 to 98 years). We identified a set of 347 DNA methylation sites that, in combination optimally predict age in the human cortex. The sum of DNA methylation levels at these sites weighted by their regression coefficients provide the cortical DNA methylation clock age estimate. The novel clock dramatically out-performed previously reported clocks in additional cortical datasets. Our findings suggest that previous associations between predicted DNA methylation age and neurodegenerative phenotypes might represent false positives resulting from clocks not robustly calibrated to the tissue being tested and for phenotypes that become manifest in older ages. The age distribution and tissue type of samples included in training datasets need to be considered when building and applying epigenetic clock algorithms to human epidemiological or disease cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Members of the Brassicaceae family have the ability to regulate pollination events occurring on the stigma surface. In Brassica species, self-pollination leads to an allele specific interaction between the pollen small cysteine-rich peptide ligand (SCR/SP11) and the stigmatic S-receptor kinase (SRK) that activates the E3 ubiquitin ligase ARC1 (Armadillo repeat-containing 1), resulting in proteasomal degradation of various compatibility factors including Glyoxalase I (GLO1) which is necessary for successful pollination. Suppression of GLO1 was sufficient to reduce compatibility, and overexpression of GLO1 in self-incompatible Brassica napus stigmas resulted in partial breakdown of the self-incompatibility response. Here, we verified if BnGLO1 could function as a compatibility factor in the artificial self-incompatibility system of Arabidopsis thaliana expressing AlSCRb, AlSRKb and AlARC1 proteins from A. lyrata. Overexpression of BnGLO1 is sufficient to breakdown self-incompatibility response in A. thaliana stigmas, suggesting that GLO1 functions as an inter-species compatibility factor. Therefore, GLO1 has an indisputable role as a compatibility factor in the stigma in regulating pollen attachment and pollen tube growth. Lastly, this study demonstrates the usefulness of an artificial self-incompatibility system in A. thaliana for interspecific self-incompatibility studies.",

    "abstract": "Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly malignant neuroendocrine tumor of the skin in which Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) DNA virus insertion can be detected in 75-89% of cases. Etiologic and phenotypic differences exist between MCC tumors with and without the inserted virus, thus it is important to distinguish between MCV+ MCC and MCV-MCC cases. Currently, MCV insertions in MCC genomes are detected using laboratory techniques. Here we report a freely available bioinformatics methodology to identify MCV+ MCC tumors using whole exome sequencing (WES) data. WES data could be also used to infer the virus insertion site into the tumor genome. Our method has been validated in a set of MCC samples previously characterized in the laboratory as MCV+ or MCV-, achieving 100% sensitivity and 62,5% specificity. Thus, with enough depth of sequencing, it is possible to use WES to the presence of MCV insertions in cancer samples.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMicrobial communities influence their environment by modifying the availability of compounds such as nutrients or chemical elicitors. Knowing the microbial composition of a site is therefore relevant to improving productivity or health. However, sequencing facilities are not always available, or may be prohibitively expensive in some cases. Thus, it would be desirable to computationally predict the microbial composition from more accessible, easily-measured features.\n\nResultsIntegrating Deep Learning techniques with microbiome data, we propose an artificial neural network architecture based on heterogeneous autoencoders to condense the long vector of microbial abundance values into a deep latent space representation. Then, we design a model to predict the deep latent space and, consequently, to predict the complete microbial composition using environmental features as input. The performance of our system is examined using the rhizosphere microbiome of Maize. We reconstruct the microbial composition (717 taxa) from the deep latent space (10 values) with high fidelity ({inverted question}0.9 Pearson correlation). We then successfully predict microbial composition from environmental variables such as plant age, temperature or precipitation (0.73 Pearson correlation, 0.42 Bray-Curtis). We extend this to predict microbiome composition under hypothetical scenarios, such as future climate change conditions. Finally, via transfer learning, we predict microbial composition in a distinct scenario with only a hundred sequences, and distinct environmental features. We propose that our deep latent space may assist microbiome-engineering strategies when technical or financial resources are limited, through predicting current or future microbiome compositions.\n\nAvailabilitySoftware, results, and data are available at https://github.com/jorgemf/DeepLatentMicrobiome",

    "abstract": "Species distribution maps are essential for assessing extinction risk and guiding conservation efforts. Here, we developed a data-driven, reproducible geospatial workflow to map species distributions and evaluate their conservation status consistent with the guidelines and criteria of the IUCN Red List. Our workflow follows five automated steps to refine the distribution of a species starting from its Extent of Occurrence (EOO) to Area of Habitat (AOH) within the species range. The ranges are produced with an Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) interpolation procedure, using presence and absence points derived from primary biodiversity data. As a case-study, we mapped the distribution of 2,273 bird species in the Americas, 55% of all terrestrial birds found in the region. We then compared our produced species ranges to the expert-drawn IUCN/BirdLife range maps and conducted a preliminary IUCN extinction risk assessment based on criterion B (Geographic Range). We found that our workflow generated ranges with fewer errors of omission, commission, and a better overall accuracy within each species EOO. The spatial overlap between both datasets was low (28%) and the expert-drawn range maps were consistently larger due to errors of commission. Their estimated Area of Habitat (AOH) was also larger for a subset of 741 forest-dependent birds. We found that incorporating geospatial data increased the number of threatened species by 52% in comparison to the 2019 IUCN Red List. Furthermore, 103 species could be placed in threatened categories (VU, EN, CR) pending further assessment. The implementation of our geospatial workflow provides a valuable alternative to increase the transparency and reliability of species risk assessments and improve mapping species distributions for conservation planning and decision-making.",

    "abstract": "DNA metabarcoding of freshwater communities typically relies on PCR amplification of a fragment of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI) gene with degenerate primers. The advantage of COI is its taxonomic resolution and the availability of an extensive reference database. However, when universal primers are used on environmental DNA (eDNA) isolated from stream water, macroinvertebrate read and OTU numbers are typically \"watered down\", i.e. diluted, compared to whole specimen  bulk samples due to greater co-amplification of abundant non-target taxa such as algae and bacteria. Because stream macroinvertebrate taxa are of prime importance for regulatory biomonitoring, more effective ways to capture their diversity via eDNA isolated from water are important. In this study, we aimed to improve macroinvertebrate assessment from eDNA by minimizing non-target amplification. Therefore, we generated data using universal primers BF2/BR2 throughout 15 months from a German Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site, the River Kinzig, to identify most abundant non-target taxa. Based on these data, we designed a new reverse primer (EPTDr2n) with 3-specificity towards macrozoobenthic taxa and validated its specificity in silico together with universal forward primer fwhF2 using available data from GenBank and BOLD. We then performed in vitro tests using 20 eDNA samples taken in the Kinzig catchment. We found that the percentage of target reads was much higher for the new primer combination compared to two universal macrozoobenthic primer pairs, BF2/BR2 and fwhF2/fwhR2n (>99 % vs. 21.4 % and 41.25 %, respectively). Likewise, number of detected macroinvertebrate taxa was substantially higher (351 vs. 46 and 170, respectively) and exceeded the number of 257 taxa identified by expert taxonomists at nearby sites across two decades of sampling. While few taxa such as Turbellaria were not detected, we show that the optimized primer avoids the dilution problem and thus significantly improves macroinvertebrate detection for bioassessment and -monitoring.",
