    "abstract": "Gene set analysis methods are widely used to analyze data from high-throughput \"omics\" technologies. One drawback of these methods is their low specificity or high false positive rate. Over-representation analysis is one of the most commonly used gene set analysis methods. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to investigate the hypothesis that gene set overlap is an underlying cause of low specificity in over-representation analysis. We quantify gene set overlap and show that it is a ubiquitous phenomenon across gene set databases. Statistical analysis indicates a strong negative correlation between gene set overlap and the specificity of over-representation analysis. We conclude that gene set overlap is an underlying cause of the low specificity. This result highlights the importance of considering gene set overlap in gene set analysis and explains the lack of specificity of methods that ignore gene set overlap. This research also establishes the direction for developing new gene set analysis methods.",

    "abstract": "Correlates of sensory stimuli and motor actions are found in multiple cortical areas, but such correlates do not indicate whether these areas are causally relevant to task performance. We trained mice to discriminate visual contrast and report their decision by turning a wheel. Widefield calcium imaging and Neuropixels recordings in cortex revealed stimulus-related activity in visual (VIS) and frontal (MOs) areas, and widespread movement-related activity across the whole dorsal cortex. Optogenetic inactivation biased choices only when targeted at VIS and MOs, at times corresponding to peak stimulus decoding. A neurometric model based on summing and subtracting activity in VIS and MOs successfully described behavioral performance and predicted the effect of optogenetic inactivation. Thus, local sensory signals in visual and frontal cortex play a causal role in task performance, while widespread dorsal cortical signals correlating with movement reflect processes that do not play a causal role.",

    "abstract": "When humans indicate on which hand a tactile stimulus occurred, they often err when their hands are crossed. This finding seemingly supports the view that the automatically determined touch location in external space affects limb assignment: the crossed right hand is localized in left space, and this conflict presumably provokes hand assignment errors. Here, participants judged on which hand the first of two stimuli, presented during a bimanual movement, had occurred, and then indicated its external location by a reach-to-point movement. When participants incorrectly chose the hand stimulated second, they pointed to where that hand had been at the correct, first time point, though no stimulus had occurred at that location. This behavior suggests that stimulus localization depended on hand assignment, not vice versa. It is, thus, incompatible with the notion of automatic computation of external stimulus location upon occurrence. Instead, humans construct external touch location post-hoc and on demand.",

    "abstract": "The complex microconnectivity of the mammalian brain underlies its computational abilities, and its vulnerability to injury and disease. It has been challenging to illuminate the features of this synaptic network due in part to the small size and exceptionally dense packing of its elements. Here we describe a rapid and accessible super-resolution imaging and image analysis workflow--SEQUIN--that identifies, quantifies, and characterizes central synapses in animal models and in humans, enabling automated volumetric imaging of mesoscale synaptic networks without the laborious production of large histological arrays. Using SEQUIN, we identify delayed cortical synapse loss resulting from diffuse traumatic brain injury. Similar synapse loss is observed in an Alzheimer disease model, where SEQUIN mesoscale mapping of excitatory synapses across the hippocampus identifies region-specific synaptic vulnerability to neurodegeneration. These results establish a novel, easily implemented and robust nano-to-mesoscale synapse quantification and molecular characterization method. They furthermore identify a mechanistic link--synaptopathy--between Alzheimer neurodegeneration and its best-established epigenetic risk factor, brain trauma.",

    "abstract": "At species range edges, individuals often face novel environmental conditions that may limit range expansion until populations adapt. The potential to adapt depends on genetic variation upon which selection can act. However, populations at species range edges are often genetically depauperated. One mechanism to increase genetic variation is to reshuffle existing variation through sex. During range expansions, sex can, however, act as a double-edged sword. The gene swamping hypothesis predicts that for populations expanding along an abiotic gradient, sex can hinder adaptation if asymmetric dispersal leads to numerous maladapted dispersers from the range core swamping the range edge. In this study, we experimentally tested the gene swamping hypothesis by performing replicated range expansions in landscapes with or without an abiotic pH-gradient, using the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila, while simultaneously manipulating the occurrence of gene flow and sex. We show that sex accelerated evolution of local adaptation in the absence of gene flow, but hindered it in the presence of gene flow. The effect of sex, however, was independent of the pH-gradient, indicating that not only abiotic gradients but also the biotic gradient in population density leads to gene swamping. Overall, our results show that gene swamping can affect adaptation in life-history strategies.",

Results are always clusters indicating anatomical regions that are significantly related to the hypothesis. There are limitations such as most methods necessitating the use of conservative family wise error control scheme and the inability to analyse region of interest (ROI) studies, which can be overcome by cluster-wise, rather than voxel-wise, analysis. The false discovery rate error control scheme is a less conservative option suitable for cluster-wise analysis and has the advantage that an easily interpretable error rate is estimated. Furthermore, cluster-wise analysis makes it possible to analyse ROI studies, expanding the pool of data sources. Here a new clustering algorithm for coordinate based analyses is detailed, along with implementation details for ROI studies.",

    "abstract": "1Brain controllability properties are normally derived from the white matter fiber tracts in which the neural substrate of the actual energy consumption, namely the gray matter, has been widely ignored. Here, we study the relationship between gray matter volume of regions across the whole cortex and their respective control property derived from the structural architecture of the white matter fiber tracts. The data suggests that the ability of white fiber tracts to exhibit control at specific nodes not only depends on the connection strength of the structural connectome but additionally strongly depends on gray matter volume at the host nodes. Our data indicates that connectivity strength and gray matter volume interact with respect to the brains control properties, such that gray matter exerts the great impact in regions with high structural connectivity. Disentangling effects of the regional gray matter volume and connectivity strength, we found that frontal and sensory areas play crucial roles in controllability. Together these results suggest that structural and regional properties of the white matter and gray matter provide complementary information in studying the control properties of the intrinsic structural and functional architectural of the brain.",

    "abstract": "The solution to address global human Zn deficiency is Zn biofortification of staple food crops, aimed at high grain Zn concentration as well as high yield. However, the desired high grain Zn concentration above 40 mg kg-1 is rarely observed for high-yield wheat on worldwide calcareous soils, due to inadequate Zn uptake or Zn distribution to grain. The present study aims to investigate how much Zn uptake or distribution is adequate to achieve the Zn.t of high-yield wheat on calcareous soils with low available Zn ([~] 0.5 mg kg-1). Of the 123 cultivars tested in a three-year field experiment, 19 high-yield cultivars were identified with similar yields around 7.0 t ha-1 and various grain Zn concentrations from 9.3 to 26.7 mg kg-1. The adequate Zn distribution to grain was defined from the view of Zn biofortification, as the situation where the Zn distribution to grain (Zn harvest index) increased to the observed maximum of [~] 91.0% and the Zn concentration of vegetative parts (straw Zn concentration) decreased to the observed minimum of [~] 1.5 mg kg-1 (Zn.m). Under the assumed condition of adequate Zn distribution to grain ([~] 91.0%), all the extra Zn above Zn.m was remobilized from straw to grain and the grain Zn concentration would be increased to its highest attainable level, which was 14.5 [~] 31.3 mg kg-1 for the 19 high-yield cultivars but still lower than 40 mg kg-1. Thus, even with the adequate Zn distribution to grain, the current Zn uptake is still not adequate and needs to be increased to 308 g ha-1 or higher to achieve Zn.t for high-yield wheat (7.0 t ha-1) on low-Zn calcareous soils. Besides, the established method here can also provide the priority measures and quantitative guidelines to achieve Zn biofortification in other wheat production regions.",

We developed a smartphone based microscopic assay method to screen (oo)cysts of Cryptosporodium and Giardia contamination in vegetable and water samples. We used sapphire ball lens as the major imaging element to modify a smartphone as a microscope. Imaging parameters such as field of view and magnification, and image contrast under different staining and illumination conditions were measured. The smartphone microscope method consisting of ball lens of 1 mm diameter, white LED as illumination source and Lugolss iodine staining provided magnification and contrast capable of distinguishing (oo)cysts of Crypstopsporodium and Giardia in the same sample. The analytical performance of the method was tested by spike recovery experiments. The spiking recovery experiments performed on cabbage, carrot, cucumber, radish, tomatoes, and water resulted 26.8{+/-}10.3, 40.1{+/-}8.5, 44.4{+/-}7.3, 47.6{+/-}11.3, 49.2 {+/-}10.9, and 30.2{+/-}7.9% recovery for Cryptosporodium, respectively and 10.2{+/-}4.0, 14.1{+/-}7.3, 24.2{+/-}12.1, 23.2{+/-}13.7, 17.1{+/-}13.9, and 37.6{+/-}2.4 % recovery for Giardia, respectively. These recovery results were found to be similar when compared with the commercial brightfield and fluorescence microscopes. We tested the smartphone microscope system for detecting (oo)cysts on 7 types of vegetable (n=196) and river water (n=18) samples. Forty two percent vegetable and thirty-nine percent water samples were found to be contaminated with Cryptosporodium oocyst. Similarly, thirty one percent vegetable and thirty three percent water samples were contaminated with Giardia cyst. This study showed that the developed method can be a cheaper alternative for simultaneous detection of (oo)cysts in vegetable and water samples.",

    "abstract": "Despite the essential role of protein intake for health and development, very little is known about the impact of protein restriction on neurobiological functions, especially at different stages of the lifespan. The dopamine system is a central actor in the integration of food-related processes and is influenced by physiological state and food-related signals. Moreover, it is highly sensitive to dietary effects during early life periods such as adolescence due to its late maturation. In the present study, we investigated the impact of protein restriction either during adolescence or adulthood on the function of the mesolimbic (nucleus accumbens) and nigrostriatal (dorsal striatum) dopamine pathways using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry in rat brain slices. In the nucleus accumbens, protein restriction in adults increased dopamine release in response to low and high frequency trains of stimulation (1-20 Hz). By contrast, protein restriction performed at adolescence decreased nucleus accumbens dopamine release. In the dorsal striatum, protein restriction has no impact on dopamine release when performed at adulthood but in adolescent rats we observed frequency-dependent increases in stimulated dopamine release. Taken together, our results highlight the sensitivity of the different dopamine pathways to the effect of protein restriction, as well as their vulnerability to deleterious diet effects at different life stages.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which in humans is highly infectious and leads to the potentially fatal disease COVID-19, has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and huge global disruption. The viral infection may also represent an existential threat to our closest living relatives, the nonhuman primates, many of which are endangered and often reduced to small populations. The virus engages the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), through the receptor binding domain (RBD) on the spike protein. The contact surface of ACE2 displays amino acid residues that are critical for virus recognition, and variations at these critical residues are likely to modulate infection susceptibility across species. While infection studies are emerging and have shown that some primates, such as rhesus macaques and vervet monkeys, develop COVID-19-like symptoms when exposed to the virus, the susceptibility of many other nonhuman primates is unknown. Here, we show that all apes, including chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, and all African and Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit the same set of twelve key amino acid residues as human ACE2. Monkeys in the Americas, and some tarsiers, lemurs and lorisoids, differ at significant contact residues, and protein modeling predicts that these differences should greatly reduce the binding affinity of the ACE2 for the virus, hence moderating their susceptibility for infection. Other lemurs are predicted to be closer to catarrhines in their susceptibility. Our study suggests that apes and African and Asian monkeys, as well as some lemurs are all likely to be highly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, representing a critical threat to their survival. Urgent actions have been undertaken to limit the exposure of Great Apes to humans, and similar efforts may be necessary for many other primate species.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the pandemic of respiratory disease known as COVID-19, which emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province, China in late 2019. Both vaccines and targeted therapeutics for treatment of this disease are currently lacking. Viral entry requires binding of the viral spike receptor binding domain (RBD) with the human angiotensin converting enzyme (hACE2). In an earlier paper1, we report on the specific residue interactions underpinning this event. Here we report on the de novo computational design of high affinity antibody variable regions through the recombination of VDJ genes targeting the most solvent-exposed hACE2-binding residues of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein using the software tool OptMAVEn-2.02. Subsequently, we carry out computational affinity maturation of the designed prototype variable regions through point mutations for improved binding with the target epitope. Immunogenicity was restricted by preferring designs that match sequences from a 9-mer library of \"human antibodies\" based on H-score (human string content, HSC)3. We generated 106 different designs and report in detail on the top five that trade-off the greatest affinity for the spike RBD epitope (quantified using the Rosetta binding energies) with low H-scores. By grafting the designed Heavy (VH) and Light (VL) chain variable regions onto a human framework (Fc), high-affinity and potentially neutralizing full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can be constructed. Having a potent antibody that can recognize the viral spike protein with high affinity would be enabling for both the design of sensitive SARS-CoV-2 detection devices and for their deployment as therapeutic antibodies.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a currently uncontrolled pandemic and the etiological agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is important to study the host range of SARS-CoV-2 because some domestic species might harbor the virus and transmit it back to humans. In addition, insight into the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses to utilize animal orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might provide structural insight into improving ACE2-based viral entry inhibitors. Here we show that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic and wild animals support entry of SARS-CoV-2, as well as that of SARS-CoV-1, bat coronavirus RaTG13, and a coronavirus isolated from pangolins. Some of these species, including camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, and rabbits may serve as potential intermediate hosts for new human transmission, and rabbits in particular may serve as a useful experimental model of COVID-19. We show that SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 entry could be potently blocked by recombinant IgG Fc-fusion proteins of viral spike protein receptor-binding domains (RBD-Fc) and soluble ACE2 (ACE2-Fc). Moreover, an ACE2-Fc variant, which carries a D30E mutation and has ACE2 truncated at its residue 740 but not 615, outperforms all the other ACE2-Fc variants on blocking entry of both viruses. Our data suggest that RBD-Fc and ACE2-Fc could be used to treat and prevent infection of SARS-CoV-2 and any new viral variants that emerge over the course of the pandemic.",

Topological clustering and pathway enrichment analysis show that SARS-CoV-2 target central nodes of host-viral network that participate in core functional pathways.

    "abstract": "The newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has now been reported from around 183 countries with more than a million confirmed human cases including more than 68000 deaths. The genomes of SARS-COV-2 strains isolated from different parts of the world are now available and the unique features of constituent genes and proteins have gotten substantial attention recently. Spike glycoprotein is widely considered as a possible target to be explored because of its role during the entry of coronaviruses into host cells. We analyzed 320 whole-genome sequences and 320 spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 using multiple sequence alignment tools. In this study, 483 unique variations have been identified among the genomes including 25 non-synonymous mutations and one deletion in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. Among the 26 variations detected, 12 variations were located at the N-terminal domain and 6 variations at the receptor-binding domain (RBD) which might alter the interaction with receptor molecules. In addition, 22 amino acid insertions were identified in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison with that of SARS-CoV. Phylogenetic analyses of spike protein revealed that Bat coronavirus have a close evolutionary relationship with circulating SARS-CoV-2. The genetic variation analysis data presented in this study can help a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Based on our findings, potential inhibitors can be designed and tested targeting these proposed sites of variation.",

    "abstract": "Noncanonical nucleic acid structures play important roles in the regulation of molecular processes. Considering the importance of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, we decided to evaluate genomes of all coronaviruses sequenced to date (stated more broadly, the order Nidovirales) to determine if they contain noncanonical nucleic acid structures. We discovered much evidence of putative G-quadruplex sites and even much more of inverted repeats (IRs) loci, which in fact are ubiquitous along the whole genomic sequence and indicate a possible mechanism for genomic RNA packaging. The most notable enrichment of IRs was found inside 5'UTR for IRs of size 12+ nucleotides, and the most notable enrichment of putative quadruplex sites (PQSs) was located before 3'UTR, inside 5'UTR, and before mRNA. This indicates crucial regulatory roles for both IRs and PQSs. Moreover, we found multiple G-quadruplex binding motifs in human proteins having potential for binding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Noncanonical nucleic acids structures in Nidovirales and in novel SARS-CoV-2 are therefore promising druggable structures that can be targeted and utilized in the future.",

    "abstract": "Since 2002, beta coronaviruses (CoV) have caused three zoonotic outbreaks, SARS-CoV in 2002, MERS-CoV in 2012, and the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 late in 2019 (also named as COVID-19 or novel coronavirus 2019 or nCoV2019. Spike(S) protein, one of the structural proteins of this virus plays key role in receptor (ACE2) binding and thus virus entry. Thus, this protein has attracted scientists for detailed study and therapeutic targeting. As the 2019 novel coronavirus takes its course throughout the world, more and more sequence analyses are been done and genome sequences getting deposited in various databases. From India two clinical isolates have been sequenced and the full genome deposited in GenBank. We have performed sequence analyses of the spike protein of the Indian isolates and compared with that of the Wuhan, China (where the outbreak was first reported). While all the sequences of Wuhan isolates are identical, we found point mutations in the Indian isolates. Out of the two isolates one was found to harbour a mutation in its Receptor binding domain (RBD) at position 407. At this site arginine (a positively charged amino acid) was replaced by isoleucine (a hydrophobic amino acid that is also a C-beta branched amino acid). This mutation has been seen to change the secondary structure of the protein at that region and this can potentially alter receptor ding of the virus. Although this finding needs further validation and more sequencing, the information might be useful in rational drug designing and vaccine engineering.",

DNA was extracted using the DNeasy(R) Blood and Tissue. Paired-end library was prepared using Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina(R) MiSeq bench top sequencer generating 300 bp paired-end reads. Spades v3.12.0 was used for assembly, Resfinder v3.1. for acquired resistance genes and Snippy V2 for variants calling. Integron finder v1.5.1 was used to identify the integrons present in the genomes.\n\nResultsThe recent isolate 219 was resistant to all tested antibiotics except polymyxin while isolate 198 was resistant to ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, gentamicin and tobramycin. Among historical isolates five were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin and ciprofloxacin, four were resistant to levofloxacin while two were resistant to polymyxin. Twenty-four acquired resistance genes were present in the 2018 isolates compared to 11 in the historical isolates. All isolates contained the following genes encoding for aminoglycoside aph(6)-Id, aph(3')-lIb, aph(3'')-Ib), beta-lactam (blaPAO), tetracycline (tet(G)), fosfomycin (fosA), chloramphenicol (catB7), sulphonamide (sul1), quaternary ammonium (qacEdelta1) and fluoroquinolone (crpP) resistance. Isolate 198 possessed aph(3')-VI, rmtD2, qnrVC1, blaOXA-488, blaPME-1, while 219 possessed aadA1, rmtB, aac(6')-Ib-cr, blaTEM-1B, blaVIM-2, mph(E), mph(A), msr(E). In the isolate 219 genes blaTEM-1b, blaVIM-2, sul1, qnrvc1, rmtB and aadA1 were carried on class 1 integron. While an incomplete class 1 integron was also found in isolate 198 which was located on the genome where gene rmtB, blaPME-1, qnrVC1 and sul1 genes were positioned. There were no notable differences in the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms, but recent isolates carried more insertions and deletions in their genes.\n\nConclusionP. aeruginosa ocular clonal isolates have changed over time, with strains acquiring genes and having more insertions and deletions in their chromosomal genes that confirm resistance to antibiotics.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRecent clonal ocular isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from India have acquired a number of resistance genes compared to historical clones\nC_LIO_LIConsequently, resistance to antibiotics particularly fluoroquinolones in recent clones of P. aeruginosa appears to have increased.\nC_LIO_LIThe acquired resistance genes found in the recent P. aeruginosa isolates were related to mobile genetic elements.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Hard ticks are blood-feeding arthropods that carry and transmit microbes to their vertebrate hosts1. Tick-borne disease cases have been on the rise over the last several decades, drawing much-needed attention to the molecular interplay between transmitted pathogens and their human hosts. However, far less is known about how ticks control their own microbes, which is critical for understanding how zoonotic transmission cycles persist. We previously found that ticks horizontally acquired an antimicrobial toxin gene from bacteria known as domesticated amidase effector 2 (dae2)2. Here we show that this effector from the tick vector Ixodes scapularis (Dae2Is) has structurally and biochemically diverged from ancestral bacterial representatives, expanding its antibacterial targeting range to include host skin microbes. Disruption of dae2Is increases the burden of skin-associated staphylococci within I. scapularis and adversely affects tick fitness, suggesting resistance of host microbes may be important for the parasitic blood-feeding lifestyle. In contrast, Dae2Is has no intrinsic ability to kill Borrelia burgdorferi, the tick-borne bacterium of Lyme disease. Our observations suggest that ticks have evolved to tolerate their own symbionts while resisting host skin commensals, which we discover are natural opportunistic pathogens of ticks. This work moves our understanding of vector biology beyond a human-centric view: just as tick commensals are pathogenic to humans, so too do our commensals pose a threat to ticks. These observations illuminate how a complex and mirrored set of interkingdom interactions between blood-feeding vectors, their hosts, and associated microbes can ultimately lead to disease.",

    "abstract": "Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is an opportunistic infection of the oral mucosa caused by the commensal fungus C. albicans. IL-17 receptor signaling is essential to prevent OPC in mice and humans, but the individual roles of its ligands, IL-17A, IL-17F and IL-17AF, are less clear. A homozygous IL-17F deficiency in mice does not cause OPC susceptibility, whereas mice lacking IL-17A are moderately susceptible. In humans, a rare heterozygous mutation in IL-17F (IL-17F.S65L) was identified that causes chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, suggesting the existence of essential antifungal pathways mediated by IL-17F and/or IL-17AF. To investigate the role of IL-17F and IL-17AF in more detail, we exploited this  experiment of nature by creating a mouse line bearing the homologous mutation in IL-17F (Ser65Leu) by CRISPR/Cas9.The resulting Il17fS65L/S65L mice showed increased susceptibility to OPC, but only in homozygous, not heterozygous, mutant mice. The mutation was linked to impaired CXC chemokine expression and neutrophil recruitment to the infected tongue but not to alterations in antimicrobial peptide expression. These findings suggest mechanisms by which the enigmatic cytokine IL-17F contributes to host defense against fungi.",

However, we recently demonstrated that our M. mycetomatis specific PCR can cross-react with Madurella pseudomycetomatis. We therefore used a comparative genome approach to develop a new M. mycetomatis specific PCR for species identification. For this we compared the published M. mycetomatis genome to genomes of other organisms in BLASTCLUST to identify unique M. mycetomatis predicted protein coding sequences. Based on 16 of these unique sequences, PCR primers were developed. The specificity of these primers was further evaluated in other eumycetoma causing agents including the Madurella sibling species. Out of the 16 tested sequences, only one was unique for M. mycetomatis and this should be used as a novel diagnostic marker for M. mycetomatis.",

    "abstract": "The nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecium can survive for prolonged periods of time on surfaces in the absence of nutrients. This trait is thought to contribute to the ability of E. faecium to spread among patients in hospitals. Because there is currently a lack of data on the mechanisms that are responsible for the ability of E. faecium to survive in the absence of nutrients, we performed a high-throughput transposon mutant library screening (Tn-seq) to identify genes that have a role in long-term survival during incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 20{degrees}C. A total of 18 genes were identified by Tn-seq to contribute to survival in PBS, with functions associated with the general stress response, DNA repair, metabolism, and membrane homeostasis. The gene which was quantitatively most important for survival in PBS was usp (locus tag: EfmE745_02439), which is predicted to encode a 17.4 kDa universal stress protein. After generating a targeted deletion mutant in usp, we were able to confirm that usp significantly contributes to survival in PBS and this defect was restored by in trans complementation. As usp is present in 99% of 1644 E. faecium genomes that span the diversity of the species, we postulate that this gene is a key determinant for the remarkable environmental robustness of E. faecium. Further mechanistic studies into usp and other genes identified in this study may shed further light on the mechanisms by which E. faecium can survive in the absence of nutrients for prolonged periods of time.",

XAB2-dependent Ku eviction also occurred at seDSBs generated by the topoisomerase I poison campthotecin and operated in parallel to an ATM-dependent pathway previously described. Although Ku retention elicited by loss of XAB2 did not prevent RAD51 focus formation, the resulting RAD51-ssDNA associations were unproductive, leading to increased engagement of non-homologous-end-joining in S/G2 and genetic instability. Overexpression of RAD51 or the single-stranded DNA annealing factor RAD52 rescued the XAB2 defects. RAD52 depletion led to severe temozolomide sensitivity, whereas a synthetic lethality interaction was observed between RAD52 and XAB2.",

Daily cycles of light exposure and energy consumption suggest that mitochondrial turnover is important for cone health. We investigated the 3-D ultrastructure and metabolic function of zebrafish cone mitochondria throughout the day. At night cones undergo a mitochondrial biogenesis event, corresponding to an increase in the number of smaller, simpler mitochondria and increased metabolic activity. In the daytime, ER and autophagosomes associate more with mitochondria, and mitochondrial size distribution across the cluster changes. We also report dense material shared between cone mitochondria that is extruded from the cell in darkness, sometimes forming extracellular structures. Our findings reveal an elaborate set of daily changes to cone mitochondrial structure and function.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/030262v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@101b1f9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4b79eeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1320df3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@131edf5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "To generate new vessels, endothelial cells (ECs) form invadosomes, which are actin-based microdomains with a proteolytic activity that degrade the basement membrane. We previously demonstrated that ECs form linear invadosomes in fibrillar type I collagen context. In this study, we aim to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which ECs guides angiogenesis in a fibrillar type I collagen context. We found that Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 (DDR2) is the collagen receptor tyrosine kinase required to form linear invadosomes in ECs. We further demonstrated that it acts in synergy with VEGF to promote extracellular matrix degradation. We highlighted the involvement of an interaction between DDR2 and the matrix metalloproteinase MMP14 in this process. Finally, using in vitro and ex-vivo angiogenesis assays, we demonstrated a pro-angiogenic function of DDR2 in a collagen-rich microenvironment. This study allows us to propose DDR2-dependent linear invadosomes as targets to modulate angiogenesis.",

While Pa can initiate long-term infections in younger CF patients, Bcc infections only arise in teenagers and adults. Both Pa and Bcc use type VI secretion systems (T6SS) to mediate interbacterial competition. Here, we show that Pa isolates from teenage/adult CF patients, but not those from young CF patients, are outcompeted by the epidemic Bcc isolate Burkholderia cenocepacia strain AU1054 (BcAU1054) in a T6SS-dependent manner. The genomes of susceptible Pa isolates harbor T6SS-abrogating mutations, the repair of which, in some cases, rendered the isolates resistant. Moreover, seven of eight Bcc strains outcompeted Pa strains isolated from the same patients. Our findings suggest that certain mutations that arise as Pa adapts to the CF lung abrogate T6SS activity, making Pa and its human host susceptible to potentially fatal Bcc superinfection.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical and experimental observations that catalysis enhances the diffusion of enzymes have generated exciting implications about nanoscale energy flow, molecular chemotaxis and self-powered nanomachines. However, contradictory claims on the origin, magnitude, and consequence of this phenomenon continue to arise. Experimental observations of catalysis-enhanced enzyme diffusion, to date, have relied almost exclusively on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), a technique that provides only indirect, ensemble-averaged measurements of diffusion behavior. Here, using an Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ABEL) trap and in-solution spectroscopy (FCS), a technique that provides only indirect, ensemble-averaged measurements of diffusion behavior. Here, using an Anti-Brownian ELectrokinetic (ABEL) trap and in-solution single-particle tracking (SPT), we show that catalysis does not increase the diffusion of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) at the single-molecule level, in sharp contrast to the ~20% enhancement seen in parallel FCS experiments using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as substrate. Combining comprehensive FCS controls, ABEL trap, surface-based single-molecule fluorescence, and Monte-Carlo simulations, we establish that pNPP-induced dye blinking at the ~10 ms timescale is responsible for the apparent diffusion enhancement seen in FCS. Our observations urge a crucial revisit of various experimental findings and theoretical models--including those of our own--in the field, and indicate that in-solution SPT and ABEL trap are more reliable means to investigate diffusion phenomena at the nanoscale.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTRecent experiments have suggested that the energy released by a chemical reaction can propel its enzyme catalyst (for example, alkaline phosphatase, ALP). However, this topic remains controversial, partially due to the indirect and ensemble nature of existing measurements. Here, we used recently developed single-molecule approaches to monitor directly the motions of individual proteins in aqueous solution and find that single ALP enzymes do not diffuse faster under catalysis. Instead, we demonstrate that interactions between the fluorescent dye and the enzymes substrate can produce the signature of apparent diffusion enhancement in fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), the standard ensemble assay currently used to study enzyme diffusion and indicate that single-molecule approaches provide a more robust means to investigate diffusion at the nanoscale.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, great progress in sequencing technologies and computational biology has revealed that the majority of the mammalian genome considered to be noncoding is rich in functional elements able to produce proteins. Many RNA molecules, mis-annotated as noncoding, actually harbor small open reading frames that are predicted to code for proteins. Some of those proteins have been verified to play critical roles in multiple biological processes. The lipid droplet (LD) is a unique cellular organelle, conserved from bacteria to humans, and is closely associated with cellular lipid metabolism and metabolic disorders. No noncoding RNA-coded proteins have been identified on LDs. Here, for the first time, we searched the organelle for their presence. After the enrichment of small proteins of LDs isolated from myoblasts, we used mass spectrometry coupled with our lab made protein database to identify LD-associated noncoding RNA-encoded proteins (LDANPs). A total of 15 new proteins were identified. One of them was studied further and termed LDANP1. LDANP1 was localized on LDs by imaging, cell fractionation, and immunogold labeling. Like LD resident proteins, LDANP1 was degraded by the proteasome. Using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technique, the endogenous expression of LDANP1 was validated. The stable expression of LDANP1 suppressed the accumulation of triacylglycerol in oleic acid treated myoblasts and inhibited the rescue of palmitate-inhibited insulin sensitivity by oleic acid. In summary, we report for the first time that translatable, nominally noncoding RNA-derived proteins, which are new and cannot be identified using current research methods, were associated with LDs and that among these, LDANP1 modulated lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity. The discovery of noncoding RNA-encoded proteins on LDs paves a new way for the research of LDs and lipid metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Loss of proteostasis and cellular senescence are key hallmarks of aging. Recent studies suggest that lung fibroblasts from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) show features of cellular senescence, decline in heat shock proteins (HSPs) expression and impaired protein homeostasis (proteostasis). However, direct cause-effect relationships are still mostly unknown. In this study, we sought to investigate whether the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), a major transcription factor that regulates the cellular HSPs network and cytoplasmic proteostasis, contributes to cellular senescence in lung fibroblasts. We found that IPF lung fibroblasts showed an upregulation in the expression of various cellular senescence markers, including {beta}-galactosidase activity (SA-{beta}-gal) staining, the DNA damage marker {gamma}H2Ax, the cell cycle inhibitor protein p21, and multiple senescence-associated secretory proteins (SASP), as well as upregulation of collagen 1a1, fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (-SMA) gene expression compared with age-matched controls. These changes were associated with impaired proteostasis, as judged by an increase in levels of p-HSF1ser307 and HSF1K298 sumo, downregulation of HSPs expression, and increased cellular protein aggregation. Similarly, lung fibroblasts isolated from a mouse model of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and mouse lung fibroblast chronically treated with H2O2 showed downregulation in HSPs and increased in cellular senescence and SASP markers. Moreover, sustained pharmacologic activation of HSF1 increased the expression of HSPs, reduced cellular senescence markers and effectively reduced the expression of pro-fibrotic genes in IPF fibroblast. Our data provide evidence that the HSF1-mediated proteostasis is important for driving lung fibroblasts toward cellular senescence and a myofibroblast phenotype. We postulate that enhancing HSF1 activity could be effective in the treatment of lung fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Rad3 is the orthologue of ATR and the sensor kinase of the DNA replication checkpoint in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Under replication stress, it initiates checkpoint signaling at the forks necessary for maintaining genome stability and cell survival. To better understand the checkpoint initiation process, we have carried out a genetic screen in fission yeast by random mutation of the genome looking for mutants with defects in Rad3 kinase signaling. In addition to the previously reported tel2-C307Y mutant (1), this screen has identified six mutations in rqh1 encoding a RecQ DNA helicase. Surprisingly, these rqh1 mutations except a start codon mutation are all in the helicase domain, indicating that the helicase activity of Rqh1 plays an important role in the replication checkpoint. In support of this notion, integration of two helicase-inactive mutations or deletion of rqh1 generated a similar Rad3 signaling defect and heterologous expression of human RECQ1, BLM and RECQ4 restored the Rad3 signaling and partially rescued a rqh1 helicase mutant. Therefore, the replication checkpoint function of Rqh1 is highly conserved and mutations in the helicase domain of these human enzymes may cause the checkpoint defect and contribute to the cancer predisposition syndromes.",

Contrasting beneficial traits include antifungal production exploited by insects to protect their eggs, plant protective abilities and antibiotic biosynthesis. We explored the ecological diversity and specialized metabolite biosynthesis of 206 B. gladioli strains, phylogenomically defining 5 evolutionary clades. Historical disease pathovars (pv) B. gladioli pv. allicola and B. gladioli pv. cocovenenans were phylogenetically distinct, while B. gladioli pv. gladioli and B. gladioli pv. agaricicola were indistinguishable. Soft-rot disease and CF infection pathogenicity traits were conserved across all pathovars. Biosynthetic gene clusters for toxoflavin, caryoynencin and enacyloxin were dispersed across B. gladioli, but bongkrekic acid and gladiolin production were clade specific. Strikingly, 13% of CF-infection strains characterised (n=194) were bongkrekic acid toxin positive, uniquely linking this food-poisoning risk factor to chronic lung disease. Toxin production was suppressed by exposing strains to the antibiotic trimethoprim, providing a potential therapeutic strategy to minimise poisoning risk in CF.",

    "abstract": "STUDY QUESTIONDoes testosterone use in females affect reproductive potential, particularly with regard to the production of fertilizable gametes?\n\nSUMMARY ANSWERTestosterone cypionate injections given to post-pubertal female mice caused virilization and ovaries were smaller than control ovaries, but ovaries were still responsive to hormonal stimulation and produced fertilizable eggs when superovulated.\n\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADYStudies to examine the effects of testosterone on reproductive potential in transgender males are lacking. Recently, a model was developed that simulates many aspects of testosterone use in transgender males in order to look at reproductive effects of testosterone in female mice. This study found masculinizing effects on the mice but did not find significant deficits on the number of ovarian follicles; however, effects of testosterone use on ovarian stimulation and fertilizability of oocytes were not investigated.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATIONA total of 66, 6-week-old Hsd:NSA(CF-1) female mice and 6 Hsd:ICR (CD-1) mice were used for this study. Mice were injected subcutaneously with 400 g testosterone cypionate or sesame oil once a week for 6 weeks and were either sacrificed a week after the 6th injection (active exposure group), or were sacrificed 6-7 weeks after the final testosterone injection (washout group).\n\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODSBoth active exposure and washout groups were further subdivided into 3 groups: unstimulated, eCG-stimulated, or eCG/hCG-stimulated. eCG-stimulated mice were sacrificed 44-48 hrs after eCG injection. eCG/hCG-stimulated mice were injected with eCG, followed 48 hrs later with hCG. Mice were sacrificed [~]13-18 hrs after the hCG injection. Data collected included daily vaginal cytology, terminal hormone levels and ovary weights, ovarian histology, number of oocytes/eggs collected in each group, and cleavage to the 2-cell stage following in vitro fertilization.\n\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCETestosterone cypionate-treated mice had testosterone levels elevated to the level of male mice and ceased cycling. Ovaries were significantly smaller in testosterone-treated mice, but they contained normal cohorts of follicles and responded to gonadotropin stimulation by ovulating similar numbers of eggs that fertilized and cleaved in vitro.\n\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTIONOur model treated female mice for only 6 weeks, whereas many transgender men use testosterone for many years before considering biological children. Importantly, a mouse system may not perfectly simulate human reproductive physiology.\n\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGSThe current standard of care for transgender men who desire biological children is to cease testosterone therapy prior to ovarian stimulation, but the necessity for stopping testosterone is not known. Our model demonstrates that it is possible for testosterone-suppressed ovaries to respond to gonadotropic stimulation by producing and ovulating fertilizable eggs, thereby obviating the need for testosterone cessation prior to ovarian stimulation. In time, these results may provide insights for future clinical trials of fertility treatment options for transgender men.",

    "abstract": "The Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) is the largest family of secondary active membrane transporters and is found in all domains of Life. MFS proteins are known to adopt different conformational states, yet details on the interconversion rates are crucially needed to understand or target their transport mechanism. Here, we studied the proton/multidrug antiporter LmrP as a model system for antibiotic resistance development in bacteria. The conformational cycle of LmrP is triggered by the protonation of a network of specific amino acids, yet the role of the transported substrate in these transitions has been puzzling. To measure LmrP structure in real-time, we performed solution-based single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) using a confocal microscope with direct alternating donor/acceptor excitation and multiparameter (intensity, lifetime, anisotropy) detection. Lowering pH from 8 to 5 triggered an overall conformational transition, corroborating that detergent solubilization allows studying the LmrP transport cycle using smFRET. Using a newly developed linear 3-state photon distribution analysis (PDA) model, we show that the apo protein interconverted between two structures at low rate (>>10 ms dwell time) at the cytosolic side while it interconverts dynamically between the 3 states (< 10 ms dwell time) at the extracellular side. When the Hoechst 33342 model substrate is added, inward conformational interconversions are greatly accelerated, coupled to an overall outward conformational halting, consistently with efficient proton exchange with the extracellular environment. Roxithromycin substrate binding did not halt but shift conformational interconversions from one pair of states to another. Substrate dependent structural heterogeneity is indicative of a general mechanism by which MFS transporters can efficiently transport a variety of substrates, and advocates for combined structure/dynamics-based drug design when targeting MDR transporters.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARYWe studied the conformational cycle of LmrP, a model for multidrug efflux pumps, using single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET). By following changes in FRET signal between different sets of positions, we specifically investigated how substrate binding modulates structural conversions between inward-open and outward-open states. Using a newly developed probabilistic analysis for describing sequential interconversion kinetics, we show that the apo protein slowly interconverts between defined states at the cytosolic and at the extracellular sides. Binding of the model substrate Hoechst33342 leads to an increase in conformational interconversions at the intracellular side while the extracellular side shows a drastic decrease in conversion, indicating a kinetic uncoupling between both sides. Remarkably, binding of roxithromycin, while also increasing interconversion on the intracellular side, did not slow the extracellular conversions. This indicates that multidrug pumps have evolved substrate-dependent transport mechanisms than enable transport of structurally diverse collection of substrates.",

Some of the evidence supporting its involvement in melanoma appeared contradictory, suggesting that NODAL in this context might rely on a non-canonical signalling mode. We found that NODAL inactivation in a metastatic melanoma cell line prevents the cells from acquiring invasive behaviour. However, we show that this phenotype does not result from the absence of NODAL, but from a defect in the expression of a natural antisense transcript of NODAL, here called LADON. We found that LADON promotes the mesenchymal to amoeboid transition that is critical to melanoma cell invasiveness, and that a WNT/{beta}-CATENIN signalling-dependent increase in LADON expression is required to complete this transition. LADONs downstream effectors include, among others, the proto-oncogene MYCN.

    "abstract": "Characterizing the genetic architecture of species boundaries remains a difficult task. Hybridizing species provide a powerful system to identify the factors that shape genomic variation and, ultimately, identify the regions of the genome that maintain species boundaries. Unfortunately, complex histories of isolation, admixture and selection can generate heterogenous genomic landscapes of divergence which make inferences about the regions that are responsible for species boundaries problematic. However, as the signal of admixture and selection on genomic loci varies with recombination rate, their relationship can be used to infer their relative importance during speciation. Here, we explore patterns of genomic divergence, admixture and recombination rate among hybridizing lineages across the Heliconius erato radiation. We focus on the incipient species, H. erato and H. himera, and distinguish the processes that drive genomic divergence across three contact zones where they frequently hybridize. Using demographic modeling and simulations, we infer that periods of isolation and selection have been major causes of genome-wide correlation patterns between recombination rate and divergence between these incipient species. Upon secondary contact, we found surprisingly highly asymmetrical introgression between the species pair, with a paucity of H. erato alleles introgressing into the H. himera genomes. We suggest that this signal may result from a current polygenic species boundary between the hybridizing lineages. These results contribute to a growing appreciation for the importance of polygenic architectures of species boundaries and pervasive genome-wide selection during the early stages of speciation with gene flow.",

    "abstract": "Healthy fish stocks are central to global food security. Key to fish health is robust immunity at mucosal surfaces, and especially at the gills. However, a balance must be struck between tolerating commensal microorganisms and reacting appropriately toward pathogens. In mammals, IL-4 and IL-13 in concert with IL-10 are essential for balancing immune response to pathogens and suppressing inflammation. Whether their fish counterparts perform similar roles is an open question. Here, we have generated IL-4/13A and IL-4/13B mutant zebrafish and, together with existing IL-10 mutants, characterized the consequences of loss-of-function of these cytokines. We demonstrate that these cytokines are required to suppress inflammation. Further, IL-4/13A and IL-4/13B are required for the maintenance of a Th2-like phenotype in the gills. As in mammals, IL-10 appears to have a more striking anti-inflammatory function than IL-4-like cytokines. Thus, both IL-10 and IL-4/13 paralogues in zebrafish exhibit aspects of conserved function with their mammalian counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Upon entering building plumbing systems, drinking water bacteria experience considerable changes in environmental conditions. For example, some flexible polymeric materials leach organic carbon, which increases bacterial growth and reduces diversity. Here we show that the carbon supply by a flexible polymeric material drives nutrient-based selection within establishing biofilm communities. We found that migrating carbon from EPDM coupons resulted in considerable growth for different drinking water communities (0.2 - 3.3 x 108 cells/cm2). All established biofilm communities showed low diversity (29 - 50 taxa/biofilm), with communities dominated by even viewer taxa (e.g., 5 taxa accounting for 94 {+/-} 5 % relative abundance, n = 15). Interestingly, biofilm communities shared some taxa (e.g., Methylobacterium spp.) and families (e.g., Comamonadaceae), despite the difference in starting communities. Moreover, selected biofilm communities performed better than their original communities regarding maximum attachment (91 {+/-} 5 vs. 69 {+/-} 23 %, n = 15) and attachment rate (5.0 {+/-} 1.7 x 104 vs. 2.4 {+/-} 1.2 x 104 cells/cm2/h, n = 15) when exposed to new EPDM coupons. Our results demonstrate nutrient-based selection during initial biofilm formation on a flexible polymeric material and a resulting benefit to selected communities. We anticipate our findings to help connecting observational microbiological findings with their underlying ecological principles. Regarding initial biofilm formation, attachment dynamics, growth, and selection thereof are important for the management of microbial communities. In fact, managing initial colonization by supplying specific carbon and/or introducing consciously chosen/designed communities potentially paves the way for a probiotic approach for building plumbing materials.",

Functional annotation of genes differentially expressed in Tharparkar and Vrindavani revealed that the systems biology in Tharparkar is moving towards counteracting the effects due to heat stress. Unlike Vrindavani, Tharparkar is not only endowed with higher expression of the scavengers (UBE2G1, UBE2S, and UBE2H) of misfolded proteins but also with protectors (VCP, Serp1, and CALR) of naive unfolded proteins. Further, higher expression of the antioxidants in Tharparkar enables it to cope up with higher levels of free radicals generated as a result of heat stress.

Hymenaea courbaril is an important species in this context and to the applied forestry. Thus, this study aimed to understand how some seedling features, could be related to the seed weight, and be affected by the population origin. The measurements consisted of seedling collar diameter, weight, protophilus area, central and lateral vein. Seed weight consistently varied between the populations in the study. Both populations had higher weight ranges than mentioned in the literature. There was no strong evidence that greater seed weight requires lesser time to germinate, conflicting with previous information. All the measurements presented enough shreds of evidence to be considered different when comparing the populations, except for the protophilus area and lateral vein length. All the studied measurements presented low correlation indexes to seed weight, except for seedling collar diameter, and seedling weight, which presented a moderate correlation. Protophilus elongation pattern was strongly associated with the leaf width when compared to midvein.",

After an in-depth analysis of the 135 BGCs, iron-binding siderophores were chosen for further investigation due to their high abundance and well-characterized bioactivities. Through various metabolomic strategies, eight siderophore scaffolds were identified in six strains of mosquito-associated bacteria. Among these, serratiochelin A and pyochelin were found to reduce female Anopheles gambiae overall fecundity likely by lowering their blood feeding rate. Serratiochelin A and pyochelin were further found to inhibit the Plasmodium parasite asexual blood and liver stages in vitro.

We report a reverse genetics approach used to identify and characterise plantacyclin B21AG. The bacteriocin was purified from culture supernatant by a short process consisting of concentration, n-butanol extraction and cation exchange chromatography. A de novo peptide sequencing using LC-MS/MS techniques identified two putative peptide fragments which were mapped to the genome of Lactobacillus plantarum B21. This revealed an ORF corresponding to a putative circular bacteriocin with a 33-amino acid leader peptide and 58-amino acid mature peptide found on native plasmid pB21AG01. The corresponding gene cluster, consisted of seven genes associated with post-translational circularisation, immunity and secretion. The robust nature of plantacyclin B21AG, its antimicrobial activity and associated machinery for cyclisation make it an interesting biotechnological target for further development, and application as a food-safe antimicrobial.",

However, it is unclear how cognitive control and associated neural circuitry relate to the development of repetitive behavior in children with these disorders. In a multicenter, longitudinal study (TACTICS; Translational Adolescent and Childhood Therapeutic Interventions in Compulsive Syndromes), the development of cognitive control was assessed during late childhood using a longitudinal fMRI design with a modified stop-signal task in children with ASD or OCD, and typically developing (TD) children (baseline: N=122 (8-12y), follow-up: N=72 (10-14y), average interval: 1.2y). Stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) decreased over development, regardless of diagnosis. Repetitive behavior in children with ASD and OCD was not associated with performance on the stop-signal task. There were no whole-brain between-group differences in brain activity, but ROI-analyses showed increases in activity in right precentral gyrus over development for children with OCD. In sum, even though subtle differences were observed in the development of brain activity in children with OCD, the findings overall suggest that the development of cognitive control, as assessed by the stop signal task, is similar in children with and without ASD or OCD.",

We found that the slug Elysia timida inflicts changes to the photosynthetic light reactions of the chloroplasts it steals from the alga Acetabularia acetabulum. Working with a large continuous laboratory culture of both the slugs (>500 individuals) and their prey algae, we show that the plastoquinone pool of slug chloroplasts remains oxidized, which can suppress reactive oxygen species formation. Slug chloroplasts also rapidly build up a strong proton motive force upon a dark-to-light transition, which helps them to rapidly switch on photoprotective non-photochemical quenching of excitation energy. Finally, our results suggest that chloroplasts inside E. timida rely on flavodiiron proteins as electron sinks during rapid changes in light intensity. These photoprotective mechanisms are expected to contribute to the long-term functionality of the chloroplasts inside the slugs.",

    "abstract": "In virological studies using HIV-1 proviral clones, virus production is normally monitored by either an RT assay or a p24 antigen capture ELISA. However, these assays are costly and time-consuming for routine handling of a large number of HIV-1 samples. In addition, sample dilution is always required in ELISA to determine p24 protein levels because of the very narrow range of detectable concentrations in this assay. Here, we establish a novel HIV-1 production assay system to solve the aforementioned problems by using a recently developed small peptide tag called HiBiT. First, we constructed a novel full-length proviral HIV-1 DNA clone and a lentiviral packaging vector in which the HiBiT tag was added to the C terminus of the integrase. Tagging the integrase with the HiBiT sequence did not impede the production or infectivity of the resultant viruses. Electron microscopy revealed normal morphology of the virus particles. Most importantly, by comparing between ELISA and the HiBiT luciferase assay, we successfully obtained an excellent linear correlation between p24 concentrations and HiBiT-based luciferase activity. Overall, we conclude that HiBiT-tagged viruses can replace the parental HIV-1 and lentiviral vectors, which enables us to perform a super-rapid, inexpensive, convenient, simple, and highly accurate quantitative assay for HIV-1 production.",

    "abstract": "Methylation-mediated pathways play an important role in the progression of cancer. Inhibitors of several key methyltransferases including DNA methyltransferases and histone methyltransferases have proven to be instrumental for both understanding the function of the respective enzymes activites and translational applications in cancer epigenetic therapy. Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is a major metabolic enzyme involved in epigenetic regulation through catalysis of methyl transfer from the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine, onto nicotinamide and other pyridines, to form S-adenosyl homocysteine and 1-methyl-nicotinamide or the corresponding pyridinium ions. Accumulating evidence infers that NNMT is a novel therapeutic target for a variety of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover potent and specific inhibitors for NNMT. Herein, we reported the design and synthesis of a fluorescent probe II138, and established a fluorescence polarization (FP)-based competition assay for evaluation of NNMT inhibitors. Importantly, the unique feature of this FP competition assay is its capability to identify inhibitors that interfere with the interaction of the NNMT active site directly or allosterically. In addition, this assay performane is robust with a Z factor of 0.76, and applicable in high-throughput screening for inhibitors for NNMT.",

    "abstract": "The nucleus, central to all cellular activity, relies on both direct mechanical input and its molecular transducers to sense and respond to external stimuli. While it has been shown that isolated nuclei can adapt to applied force ex vivo, the mechanisms governing nuclear mechanoadaptation in response to physiologic forces in vivo remain unclear. To investigate nuclear mechanoadaptation in cells, we developed an atomic force microscopy (AFM) based procedure to probe live nuclei isolated from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) following the application of low intensity vibration (LIV) to determine whether nuclear stiffness increases as a result of LIV. Results indicated that isolated nuclei were, on average, 30% softer than nuclei tested within intact MSCs prior to LIV. When the nucleus was isolated following LIV (0.7g, 90Hz, 20min) applied four times (4x) separated by 1h intervals, stiffness of isolated nuclei increased 75% compared to non-LIV controls. LIV-induced nuclear stiffening required functional Linker of Nucleoskeleton and Cytoskeleton (LINC) complex, but was not accompanied by increased levels of the nuclear envelope proteins LaminA/C or Sun-2. While depleting LaminA/C or Sun-1&2 resulted in either a 47% or 39% increased heterochromatin to nuclear area ratio in isolated nuclei, the heterochromatin to nuclear area ratio was decreased by 25% in LIV-treated nuclei compared to controls, indicating LIV-induced changes in the chromatin structure. Overall, our findings indicate that increased apparent cell stiffness in response to exogenous mechanical challenge of MSCs in the form of LIV is in part retained by increased nuclear stiffness and changes in chromatin structure.",

    "abstract": "Cotranslational folding is expected to occur when the folding speed of the nascent chain is faster than the translation speed of the ribosome, but it is difficult to predict which proteins cotranslationally fold. Here, we simulate evolution of model proteins to investigate how native structure influences evolution of cotranslational folding. We developed a model that connects protein folding during and after translation to cellular fitness. Model proteins evolved improved folding speed and stability, with proteins adopting one of two strategies for folding quickly. Low contact order proteins evolve to fold cotranslationally. Such proteins adopt native conformations early on during the translation process, with each subsequently translated residue establishing additional native contacts. On the other hand, high contact order proteins tend not to be stable in their native conformations until the full chain is nearly extruded. We also simulated evolution of slowly translating codons, finding that slowing translation at certain positions enhances cotranslational folding. Finally, we investigated real protein structures using a previously published dataset that identified evolutionarily conserved rare codons in E. coli genes and associated such codons with cotranslational folding intermediates. We found that protein substructures preceding conserved rare codons tend to have lower contact orders, in line with our finding that lower contact order proteins are more likely to fold cotranslationally. Our work shows how evolutionary selection pressure can cause proteins with local contact topologies to evolve cotranslational folding.\n\nStatement of significanceSubstantial evidence exists for proteins folding as they are translated by the ribosome. Here we developed a biologically intuitive evolutionary model to show that avoiding premature protein degradation can be a sufficient evolutionary force to drive evolution of cotranslational folding. Furthermore, we find that whether a proteins native fold consists of more local or more nonlocal contacts affects whether cotranslational folding evolves. Proteins with local contact topologies are more likely to evolve cotranslational folding through nonsynonymous mutations that strengthen native contacts as well as through synonymous mutations that provide sufficient time for cotranslational folding intermediates to form.",

    "abstract": "Cancer testis antigens (CTAs) are genes whose expression is normally restricted to the testis but anomalously activated in cancer. In sperm, a number of CTAs promote energy generation, however whether these proteins contribute to tumor cell metabolism is not understood. Here we describe COX6B2, a sperm-specific component of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). COX6B2 is frequently expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and expression correlates with reduced survival time in patients. COX6B2, but not its somatic isoform COX6B1, enhances activity of complex IV, increasing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and NAD+ generation.\n\nConsequently, COX6B2-expressing cells display a proliferative advantage, particularly in low oxygen conditions. Conversely, depletion of COX6B2 attenuates OXPHOS and collapses mitochondrial membrane potential leading to cell death or senescence.\n\nFurthermore, COX6B2 is both necessary and sufficient for growth of tumors in vivo. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated, tumor specific metabolic pathway hijacked from one of the most ATP-intensive processes in the animal kingdom: sperm motility.",

This is determined manually by visual inspection by a radiologist, then an automated computation will contribute to reduce time workload and increase precision and accuracy. TC is estimated as the ratio of tumour area by total image area estimated after the NAT. The method proposed computes TC by using machine learning techniques trained with information on morphological parameters of segmented nuclei in order to classify regions of the image as tumour or normal. The data is provided by the 2019 SPIE Breast challenge, which was proposed to develop automated TC computation algorithms. Three algorithms were implemented: Support Vector Machines, Nearest K-means and Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) decision trees. Performance based on accuracy is compared and evaluated and the best result was obtained with Support Vector Machines. Results obtained by the methods implemented were submitted during ongoing challenge with a maximum of 0.76 of prediction probability of success.",

The IC50 value of the 120 min hydrolysate ultafiltered fraction was found to be 86.74 {+/-} 0.575 {micro}g/mL, while the IC50 of Lisinopril is 0.31 {+/-} 0.07 {micro}g/mL.

    "abstract": "Finding novel biomarkers for human pathologies and predicting clinical outcomes for patients is rather challenging. This stems from the heterogenous response of individuals to disease which is also reflected in the inter-individual variability of gene expression responses. This in turn obscures differential gene expression analysis (DGE). In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, we wondered whether an alternative to DGE approaches could be applied to dissect the molecular nature of a host-response to infection exemplified here by an analysis of H1N1 influenza, community/hospital acquired pneumonia (CAP) and sepsis. To this end, we turned to the analysis of ensemble gene noise. Ensemble gene noise, as we defined it here, represents a variance within an individual for a collection of genes encoding for either members of known biological pathways or subunits of annotated protein complexes. From the law of total variance, ensemble gene noise depends on the stoichiometry of the ensemble genes expression and on their average noise (variance). Thus, rather than focusing on specific genes, ensemble gene noise allows for the holistic identification and interpretation of gene expression disbalance on the level of gene networks and systems. Comparing H1N1, CAP and sepsis patients we spotted common disturbances in a number of pathways/protein complexes relevant to the sepsis pathology which lead to an increase in the ensemble gene noise. Among others, these include mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I and peroxisomes which could be readily targeted for adjuvant treatment by methylene blue and 4-phenylbutyrate respectively. Finally, we showed that ensemble gene noise could be successfully applied for the prediction of clinical outcome, namely mortality, of CAP and sepsis patients. Thus, we conclude that ensemble gene noise represents a promising approach for the investigation of molecular mechanisms of a pathology through a prism of alterations in coherent expression of gene circuits.",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial therapies are required to treat patients with advanced cancers that have become resistant to monotherapies through rewiring of redundant pathways. Due to a massive number of potential drug combinations, there is a need for systematic approaches to identify safe and effective combinations for each patient, using cost-effective methods. Here, we developed an exact multiobjective optimization method for identifying pairwise or higher-order combinations that show maximal cancer-selectivity. The prioritization of patient-specific combinations is based on Pareto-optimization in the search space spanned by the therapeutic and nonselective effects of combinations. We demonstrate the performance of the method in the context of BRAF-V600E melanoma treatment, where the optimal solutions predicted a number of co-inhibition partners for vemurafenib, a selective BRAF-V600E inhibitor, approved for advanced melanoma. We experimentally validated many of the predictions in BRAF-V600E melanoma cell line, and the results suggest that one can improve selective inhibition of BRAF-V600E melanoma cells by combinatorial targeting of MAPK/ERK and other compensatory pathways using pairwise and third-order drug combinations. Our mechanism-agnostic optimization method is widely applicable to various cancer types, and it takes as input only measurements of a subset of pairwise drug combinations, without requiring target information or genomic profiles. Such data-driven approaches may become useful for functional precision oncology applications that go beyond the cancer genetic dependency paradigm to optimize cancer-selective combinatorial treatments.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial use on UK dairy farms is measured for surveillance purposes and utilizes veterinary sales data as a proxy for use. Two other methods of recording use have been used commonly on-farm: medicine waste bins and farm medicine records. However, none of these methods have been validated to measure antimicrobial use. The objectives of this research are to assess agreement between the 3 most common methods for measuring on-farm antimicrobial use with a pre-determined \"gold standard\" measure. Antimicrobial use was measured prospectively on 26 UK dairy farms using medicine waste bins into which participants placed all discarded medicine packaging for a 12-month period. At the end of 12 months, farm medicine records and veterinary sales data were obtained retrospectively for participating farms. The systematic difference between the mean on-farm antimicrobial use measured by each of the 3 methods with a gold standard measure was investigated using one-way repeated measures ANOVAs. Reliability and clinical relevance of the agreement between each pair of methods was quantified using the concordance correlation coefficient and the Bland-Altman method, respectively. Veterinary sales data shows excellent reliability for all forms of antimicrobial when compared with the gold standard. Medicine waste bins show moderate to excellent reliability for injectables, poor to good reliability for intramammaries and no agreement for other forms of antimicrobial. Farm medicine records do not show agreement for any form of antimicrobial when compared with the gold standard. The use of veterinary sales data as a proxy for on-farm antimicrobial use in the UK represents excellent statistical reliability and offers a clinically acceptable agreement with a gold standard method when used to measure both injectable antimicrobials and intramammary antimicrobials. These results have policy implications both nationally and internationally and are essential in quantifying the actual impact of agricultural antimicrobial use on both animal and human health.",

In addition to allowing greater independence and encouraging students to learn at their own pace, blending teaching allows the student to easily access reliable information quickly. Therefore, new studies related to active learning methodology are fundamental. In this study we analyzed 69 interactions between high school students and their teachers in a biology learning activity using a social networking site and the methodology proposed by Mortimer and Scott. The results showed that the prior knowledge of students as well as questions posing challenges and problems to be solved, a very important approach in learning Science Methodology, were barely explored by teachers and mediators (17% and 1%, respectively). Our data demonstrated that the use of digital technology alone does not guarantee interactions that contribute to the learning process in the field of natural sciences. Proposals were also discussed so that these interactions become more diversified and interesting for students, arousing interest in research and promoting the knowledge of scientific methodology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The forms of many species vocal signals are shaped by their functions1-15. In humans, a salient context of vocal signaling is infant care, as human infants are altricial16, 17. Humans often alter their vocalizations to produce \"parentese\", speech and song produced for infants that differ acoustically from ordinary speech and song18-35 in fashions that have been proposed to support parent-infant communication and infant language learning36-39; modulate infant affect33, 40-45; and/or coordinate communicative interactions with infants46-48. These theories predict a form-function link in infant-directed vocalizations, with consistent acoustic differences between infant-directed and adult-directed vocalizations across cultures. Some evidence supports this prediction23, 27, 28, 32, 49-52, but the limited generalizability of individual ethnographic reports and laboratory experiments53 and small stimulus sets54, along with intriguing reports of counterexamples55-62, leave the question open. Here, we show that people alter the acoustic forms of their vocalizations in a consistent fashion across cultures when speaking or singing to infants. We collected 1,615 recordings of infant- and adult-directed singing and speech produced by 410 people living in 21 urban, rural, and small-scale societies, and analyzed their acoustic forms. We found cross-culturally robust regularities in the acoustics of infant-directed vocalizations, such that infant-directed speech and song were reliably classified from acoustic features found across the 21 societies studied. The acoustic profiles of infant-directedness differed across language and music, but in a consistent fashion worldwide. In a secondary analysis, we studied whether listeners are sensitive to these acoustic features, playing the recordings to 51,065 people recruited online, from many countries, who guessed whether each vocalization was infant-directed. Their intuitions were largely accurate, predictable in part by acoustic features of the recordings, and robust to the effects of linguistic relatedness between vocalizer and listener. By uniting rich cross-cultural data with computational methods, we show links between the production of vocalizations and cross-species principles of bioacoustics, informing hypotheses of the psychological functions and evolution of human communication.",

    "abstract": "How the abundances of proteins are shaped by tumor microenvironments, such as hypoxic conditions and higher water content compared to normal tissues, is an important question for cancer biochemistry. Compositional analysis of more than 250 datasets for differentially expressed proteins compiled from the literature reveals a higher stoichiometric hydration state in multiple cancer types compared to normal tissue; this trend is also evident in pan-cancer transcriptomic and proteomic datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Human Protein Atlas. These findings support the notion of a basic physicochemical link between increased water content in tumors and the patterns of gene and protein expression in cancer. The generally increased hydration state is juxtaposed with a wide spectrum of carbon oxidation states of differentially expressed proteins, which may be associated with different gene ages, host tissue properties and metabolic features of specific cancer types.",

    "abstract": "There is a pressing clinical need to develop cell-based bone therapies due to a lack of viable, autologous bone grafts and a growing demand for bone grafts in musculoskeletal surgery. Such therapies can be tissue engineered and cellular, such as osteoblasts combined with a material scaffold. Because mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are both available and fast growing compared to mature osteoblasts, therapies that utilise these progenitor cells are particularly promising. We have developed a nanovibrational bioreactor that can convert MSCs into bone-forming osteoblasts in 2D and 3D but the mechanisms involved in this osteoinduction process remain unclear. Here, to elucidate this mechanism, we use increasing vibrational amplitude, from 30 nm (N30) to 90 nm (N90) amplitudes at 1000 Hz, and assess MSC metabolite, gene and protein changes. These approaches reveal that dose-dependent changes occur in MSCs responses to increased vibrational amplitude, particularly in adhesion and mechanosensitive ion channel expression, and that energetic metabolic pathways are activated, leading to low-level reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and to low-level inflammation, as well as to ROS- and inflammation-balancing pathways. These events are analogous to those that occur in the natural bone-healing processes. We have also developed a tissue engineered MSC-laden scaffold designed using cells mechanical memory, driven by the stronger N90 stimulation. These new mechanistic insights and cell-scaffold design are underpinned by a process that is free of inductive chemicals.",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic plasticity is an important guarantee for proper neural function. However, long term potentiation (LTP) was thought of as positive feedback in Hebbian plasticity. In this condition, synapse after potentiation is prone to be further potentiated. This can cause runaway dynamics of synapse and affect the stability of neural network. In order to prevent runaway synaptic dynamics, negative feedback is needed. Upon induction of LTP, the -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors was increased in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Due to the competition for glutamate between AMPA receptors and N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors, the number of opened NMDA receptor channels will reduce. Since the induction of LTP is NMDA receptors dependent, reduction of the number of activated NMDA receptors will increase the threshold of LTP induction. So the LTP of synapse itself can form a negative feedback to LTP induction. To test this hypothesis, a synaptic model with NMDA receptors and AMPA receptors coexisted was developed. When the number of AMPA receptors was increased in the PSD, the number of opened NMDA receptors was reduced though the same number of glutamate was released from presynaptic terminal. This will increase the threshold of further LTP induction and stability of synapse and neural network.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe majority of cancer evolution studies are done on individual-based approaches that neglect population dynamics necessity for the global picture of cancer evolution in each cancer type. Here, we conducted a population-based study in breast cancer to understand the timing of malignancy evolution and its correlation to the genetic evolution of pathological stages.\n\nResultsIn an omics integrative approach, we integrated gene expression and genomic aberration data for pre-invasive (DCIS, early-stage) and post-invasive (IDC, late-stage) samples and investigated the evolutionary role of further genetic changes in late stages compared to the early ones. We found that single genetic alterations (SGAs) and copy number alterations (CNAs) conspire together for the fine-tuning of the operating signaling pathways of tumors in forward and backward evolution manners. The forward evolution applies to new genetic changes that boost the efficiency of selected signaling pathways. The backward evolution, which we detected for CNAs, is a mean to reverse unwanted SGAs of earlier stages. Analyses of the integrated point mutation and gene expression data show that (i) our proposed fine-tuning concept is also applicable in metastasis, and (ii) metastasis diverges from primary tumor sometimes at the DCIS stage.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that malignant potency of breast tumors is constant over pre and post invasive pathological stages. Indeed, further genetic alterations in later stages do not establish de novo malignancy routes; however, they serve to fine-tune antecedent signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Detection of chemical cues via chemosensory receptor proteins are essential for most animals, and underlies critical behaviors, including location and discrimination of food resources, identification of sexual partners and avoidance of predators. The current knowledge of how chemical cues are detected is based primarily on data acquired from studies on insects, while our understanding of the molecular basis for chemoreception in acari, mites in particular, remains limited. The poultry red mite (PRM), Dermanyssus gallinae, is one of the most important blood-feeding ectoparasites of poultry. Unlike other ectoparasites on animals, PRM feeds mainly at night. During daytime, these animals hide themselves in crevices around the poultry house. The diversity in habitat usage, as well as the demonstrated host finding and avoidance behaviors suggest that PRM relies on their sense of smell to orchestrate complex behavioral decisions. Comparative transcriptome analyses revealed the presence of candidate variant ionotropic receptors (IRs), odorant binding proteins (OBPs), niemann-pick proteins type C2 (NPC2) and sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs). Some of these proteins were highly and differentially expressed in the forelegs of PRM. Rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were also identified, while insect-specific odorant receptors (ORs) and odorant co-receptors (ORcos) were not detected. Furthermore, using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the tarsomeres of all legs pairs were shown to be equipped with sensilla chaetica with or without tip pores, while wall-pored olfactory sensilla chaetica were restricted to the distal-most tarsomeres of the forelegs. Further, using the conserved odorant binding protein (OBP) as a test case, the results showed that RNA interference (RNAi) can be induced in D. gallinae chemosensory tissues. This study is the first to describe the presence of chemosensory genes in any Dermanyssidae family. It is also the first report of chemosensory gene knockdown by RNAi in any mite species and demonstrate that their diminutive size, less than 1 mm, is not a major impediment when applying gene knockdown approaches. Our findings make a significant step forward in understanding the chemosensory abilities of D. gallinae.",

We report that repeated acute stress induced a twofold increase in relapse incidence in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. On the other hand, environmental enrichment reduced relapse incidence and severity, and reversed the effects of repeated acute stress.

    "abstract": "The invasive rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) was an abundant food source for Lake Winnipeg walleye (Sander vitreus), especially in the north basin of the lake, until the smelts collapse in approximately 2013. We quantified changing length-at-age ({approx} growth rates) and relative mass ({approx} body condition) in Lake Winnipeg walleye caught for a gillnet index data set. Here, walleye showed smaller length-at-age, particularly in the north basin with young fish, over time. This approach to assessing growth suggests a constraint in the north basin fish, possibly a nutritional limitation between 2017 and 2018, that was not present in the south. We then analyzed a separate group of walleye ([&ge;]452 mm in fork length) sampled in 2017 as part of a large-scale tracking study, which had a similar slope in length-mass relationship to large walleye caught in that year for the gillnet index data. A panel of metabolites associated with amino acid metabolism and protein turnover was compared in whole blood. These metabolites revealed elevated essential amino acids and suggest protein degradation may be elevated in north basin walleye. Therefore, based on both growth estimates and metabolites associated with protein balance, we suggest there were spatially distinct separations affecting Lake Winnipeg walleye with decreased nutritional status of walleye in the north basin of Lake Winnipeg being of particular concern.",

We performed in vivo shRNA screening to identify targets generally associated with radiation response as well as those exhibiting a genomic dependency. This identified the histone acetyltransferases CREBBP/EP300 as a target for radiosensitization in combination with radiation in cognate mutant tumors. Further in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed this phenomenon was due to repression of homologous recombination following DNA damage and can be reproduced using chemical inhibition of histone acetyltransferase (HAT), but not bromodomain function. Selected mutations in CREBBP lead to a hyperacetylated state that increases CBP and BRCA1 acetylation, representing a gain of function targets by HAT inhibition. Additionally, mutations in CREBBP/EP300 were associated with recurrence following radiation, in several squamous cell carcinoma cohorts. These findings represent both a novel mechanism of treatment resistance and the potential for genomically-driven treatment.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant activation of RAS oncogenes is prevalent in lung adenocarcinoma, with somatic mutation of KRAS occurring in [~]30% of tumors. Recently, we identified somatic mutation of the RAS-family GTPase RIT1 in lung adenocarcinoma, but relatively little is known about the biological pathways regulated by RIT1 and how these relate to the oncogenic KRAS network. Here we present quantitative proteomic and transcriptomic profiles from KRAS-mutant and RIT1-mutant isogenic lung epithelial cells and globally characterize the signaling networks regulated by each oncogene. We find that both mutant KRAS and mutant RIT1 promote S6 kinase, AKT, and RAF/MEK signaling, and promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and immune evasion via HLA protein loss. However, KRAS and RIT1 diverge in regulation of phosphorylation sites on EGFR, USO1, and AHNAK proteins. The majority of the proteome changes are related to altered transcriptional regulation, but a small subset of proteins are differentially regulated by both oncoproteins at the post-transcriptional level, including intermediate filament proteins, metallothioneins, and MHC Class I proteins. These data provide the first global, unbiased characterization of oncogenic RIT1 network and identify the shared and divergent functions of oncogenic RIT1 and KRAS GTPases in lung cancer.",

CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) and CX3C-chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) are common features of monocyte subsets between humans and mice, i.e., C-Mo and NC-Mo are characterized as CCR2highCX3CR1low and CCR2lowCX3CR1high. Since many studies utilize mouse models to investigate roles of monocytes in human diseases, it is important to understand the similarities and differences between human and mouse monocytic subsets. In this study, we show that the expression of Cx3cr1 mRNA and CX3CR1 cell surface protein are different between circulating monocytic subsets in human but not in mice. We analyzed monocyte subsets in the blood using wild type C57BL/6 and Cx3cr1-GFP knock-in (Cx3cr1GFP/+) reporter mice. We observed higher Cx3cr1 promoter activity indicated by GFP expression in NC-Mo compared to C-Mo. However, there were no differences between the subsets in CX3CR1 mRNA nor surface protein expression determined by anti-CX3CR1 antibody or binding of fluorophore-conjugated ligand. However in the bone marrow of Cx3cr1GFP/+ mice, CX3CR1 expression was higher in NC-Mo compared to C-Mo, suggesting that mouse NC-Mo express higher level of CX3CR1 than C-Mo in the bone but this difference disappears in the blood. In contrast, human NC-Mo differentially expressed CX3CR1 compared to C-Mo in both blood and bone marrow. Given these findings, the discrepancy between promoter activity and protein levels should be considered when the roles of CX3CR1 are investigated in mouse models of human diseases.\n\nSummary sentenceIn this study, we show that the expression of Cx3cr1 mRNA is different between circulating monocytic subsets in human but not in mice.",

The resulting sequence changes generate a novel sub-genomic RNA transcript for the C-terminal dimerization domain of nucleocapsid. Deep sequencing data from 981 clinical samples confirmed the presence of the novel TRS-CS-dimerization domain RNA in individuals with the K203/R204 variant. Quantification of sub-genomic RNA indicates that viruses with the K203/R204 variant may also have increased expression of sub-genomic RNA from other open reading frames.\n\nConclusionsThe finding that homologous recombination from the TRS may have occurred since the introduction of SARS-CoV-2 in humans resulting in both coding changes and novel sub-genomic RNA transcripts suggests this as a mechanism for diversification and adaptation within its new host.",

    "abstract": "Clinical samples collected in COVID-19 patients are commonly manipulated in BSL-2 laboratories for diagnostic purpose. We used the French norm NF-EN-14476+A2 derived from the European standard EN-14885. To avoid the risk of exposure of laboratory workers, we showed that Triton-X100 must be added to guanidinium thiocyanate-lysis buffers to obtain a 6-log reduction of infectious virus. Although heating protocol consisting of 92{degrees}C-15min was more effective rather than 56{degrees}C-30min and 60{degrees}C-60min to achieve 6-log reduction, it is not amenable for molecular detection on respiratory specimens because of important decrease of detectable RNA copies in the treated sample vs untreated sample. The 56{degrees}C-30min and 60{degrees}C-60min should be used for inactivation of serum / plasma samples for serology because of the 5log10 reduction of infectivity and low viral loads in blood specimens.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus (CoV) disease termed COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2) is causing a massive pandemic worldwide, threatening public health systems across the globe. During this ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, nucleic acid detection has played an important role in early diagnosis. Here we report a SARS-CoV-2 detection protocol using a CRISPR-based CRISPR diagnostic platform - CDetection (Cas12b-mediated DNA detection). By combining sample treatment protocols and nucleic acid amplification methods with CDetection, we have established an integrated viral nucleic acid detection platform - CASdetec (CRISPR-assisted detection). The detection limit of CASdetec for SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus is 1 x 104 copies/mL, with no cross reactivity observed. Our assay design and optimization process can provide guidance for future CRISPR-based nucleic acid detection assay development and optimization.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we analyzed full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomes from multiple countries to determine early trends in the evolutionary dynamics of the novel COVID-19 pandemic. Results indicated SARS-CoV-2 evolved early into at least three phylogenetic groups, characterized by positive selection at specific residues of the accessory proteins OFR3a and ORF8a. We also report evidence of epistatic interactions among sites in the genome that may be important in the generation of variants adapted to humans. These observations might impact not only public health, but also suggest more studies are needed to understand the genetic mechanisms that may affect the development of therapeutic and preventive tools, like antivirals and vaccines.",
