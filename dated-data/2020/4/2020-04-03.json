    "abstract": "Solving environmental and social challenges such as climate change requires a shift from our current non-renewable manufacturing model to a sustainable bioeconomy. To lower carbon emissions in the production of fuels and chemicals, plant biomass feedstocks can replace petroleum using microorganisms as catalysts. The anaerobic thermophile Clostridium thermocellum is a promising bacterium for bioconversion due to its capability to efficiently degrade untreated lignocellulosic biomass. However, the complex metabolism of C. thermocellum is not fully understood, hindering metabolic engineering to achieve high titers, rates, and yields of targeted molecules. In this study, we developed an updated genome-scale metabolic model of C. thermocellum that accounts for recent metabolic findings, has improved prediction accuracy, and is standard-conformant to ensure easy reproducibility. We illustrated two applications of the developed model. We first formulated a multi-omics integration protocol and used it to understand redox metabolism and potential bottlenecks in biofuel (e.g., ethanol) production in C. thermocellum. Second, we used the metabolic model to design modular cells for efficient production of alcohols and esters with broad applications as flavors, fragrances, solvents, and fuels. The proposed designs not only feature intuitive push-and-pull metabolic engineering strategies, but also novel manipulations around important central metabolic branch-points. We anticipate the developed genome-scale metabolic model will provide a useful tool for system analysis of C. thermocellum metabolism to fundamentally understand its physiology and guide metabolic engineering strategies to rapidly generate modular production strains for effective biosynthesis of biofuels and biochemicals from lignocellulosic biomass.",

    "abstract": "Influenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein is the primary surface antigen targeted by the host immune response and a focus for development of novel vaccines, broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) and therapeutics. HA enables viral entry into host cells via receptor binding and membrane fusion and is a validated target for drug discovery. However, to date, only a very few bona fide small molecules have been reported against the HA. To identity new antiviral lead candidates against the highly conserved fusion machinery in the HA stem, we synthesized a fluorescence-polarization probe based on a recently described neutralizing cyclic peptide P7 derived from the complementarity-determining region loops of human bnAbs FI6v3 and CR9114 against the HA stem. We then designed a robust binding assay compatible with high-throughput screening to identify molecules with low M to nM affinity to influenza A group 1 HAs. Our simple, low-cost, and efficient in vitro assay was used to screen H1/Puerto Rico/8/1934 HA trimer against approximately 72,000 compounds. The crystal structure of H1/Puerto Rico/8/1934 HA in complex with our best hit compound F0045(S) confirmed that it binds to pockets in the HA stem similar to bnAbs FI6v3 and CR9114, cyclic peptide P7, and small molecule inhibitor JNJ4796. F0045 is enantioselective against a panel of group 1 HAs and F0045(S) exhibits in vitro neutralization activity against multiple H1N1 and H5N1 strains. Our assay, compound characterization, and small-molecule candidate should further stimulate the discovery and development of new compounds with unique chemical scaffolds and enhanced influenza antiviral capabilities.\n\nSummaryInfluenza hemagglutinin (HA) glycoprotein enables viral entry into host cells and is the main target for antibodies in our immune system. While HA has now been established as a validated target for drug discovery, no FDA-approved small molecules are available that specifically prevent HA from binding host receptors or inhibit its membrane fusion activity and thus prevent infection. We therefore designed a fluorescence polarization probe to enable rapid identification of small molecules that bind to the stem fusion machinery of group 1 HAs. Application of our assay yielded a small molecule to the influenza A group 1 HA stem with antiviral efficacy.",

At the time of this study, the importance of ISWI family remodellers had yet to be defined, and we had sought to assess their involvement. During this time, Barisic et al. (Nature, 2019) elegantly demonstrated that the ISWI homologue SNF2H (Smarca5) is important for nucleosomal periodicity, the binding of select transcription factors, and proper differentiation of mouse ESCs. While we do not dispute their findings to any extent, our experiments have led to slightly different conclusions, and we have chosen to use this platform to share our results.\n\nHere, we explore the importance of SNF2H by deriving a conditional knockout mouse ESC line and observing the consequences of SNF2H depletion on the pluripotent state. Cre-mediated deletion of Snf2h disrupts hallmark characteristics of pluripotency, resulting in distinct morphological changes; reduced expression of the master transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog; and reduced alkaline phosphatase activity. To understand the mechanisms of SNF2H-mediated regulation, we mapped SNF2H-bound nucleosomes genome-wide. SNF2H is broadly distributed across the genome but is preferentially enriched at active regulatory regions and transcription factor binding sites.",

    "abstract": "Multivariable Mendelian Randomisation (MVMR) is a form of instrumental variable analysis which estimates the direct effect of multiple exposures on an outcome using genetic variants as instruments. Mendelian Randomisation and MVMR are frequently conducted using two-sample summary data where the association of the genetic variants with the exposures and outcome are obtained from separate samples. If the genetic variants are only weakly associated with the exposures either individually or conditionally, given the other exposures in the model, then standard inverse variance weighting will yield biased estimates for the effect of each exposure. Here we develop a two-sample conditional F-statistic to test whether the genetic variants strongly predict each exposure conditional on the other exposures included in a MVMR model. We show formally that this test is equivalent to the individual level data conditional F-statistic, indicating that conventional rule-of-thumb critical values of F > 10, can be used to test for weak instruments. We then demonstrate how reliable estimates of the causal effect of each exposure on the outcome can be obtained in the presence of weak instruments and pleiotropy, by re-purpousing a commonly used heterogeneity Q-statistic as an estimating equation. Furthermore, the minimised value of this Q-statistic yields an exact test for heterogeneity due to pleiotropy. We illustrate our methods with an application to estimate the causal effect of blood lipid fractions on age related macular degeneration.",

    "abstract": "Infectious and parasitic diseases have major negative economic and animal welfare impacts on aquaculture of salmonid species. Improved knowledge of the functional basis of host response and genetic resistance to these diseases is key to developing preventative and treatment options. Cell lines provide a valuable model to study infectious diseases in salmonids, and genome editing using CRISPR provides an exciting avenue to evaluate the function of specific genes in those systems. While CRISPR/Cas9 has been successfully performed in a Chinook salmon cell line (CHSE-214), there are no reports to date of editing of cell lines derived from the most commercially relevant salmonid species Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout, which are difficult to transduce and therefore edit using lentivirus-mediated methods. In the current study, a method of genome editing of salmonid cell lines using ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes was optimised and tested in the most commonly-used salmonid fish cell lines; Atlantic salmon (SHK-1 and ASK cell lines), rainbow trout (RTG-2) and Chinook salmon (CHSE-214). Electroporation of RNP based on either Cas9 or Cas12a was efficient at targeted editing of all the tested lines (typically > 90 % cells edited), and the choice of enzyme expands the number of potential target sites for editing within the genomes of these species. These optimised protocols will facilitate functional genetic studies in salmonid cell lines, which are widely used as model systems for infectious diseases in aquaculture.",

    "abstract": "High telomerase activity is restricted to the blastocyst stage of embryonic development when telomere length is reset, and is characteristic of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, the pathways involved in telomerase regulation as a function of pluripotency remain unknown. To explore hTERT transcriptional control, we compare genome-wide interactions (4C-seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) between human ESCs and epithelial cells and identify several putative hTERT cis-regulatory elements. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of candidate elements in ESCs reduces the levels of hTERT mRNA but does not abolish telomerase expression, thus implicating post-transcriptional processes in telomerase regulation. In agreement with this hypothesis, we find an hTERT splice variant lacking exon-2 and prone to degradation, to be enriched in differentiated cells but absent from ESCs. In addition, we show that forced retention of exon-2 prevents telomerase silencing during differentiation. Lastly, we highlight a role for the splicing co-factor SON in hTERT exon-2 inclusion and identify a SON mutation in a Dyskeratosis congenita patient with short telomeres and decreased telomerase activity. Altogether, our data uncover a novel alternative splice switch that is critical for telomerase activity during development.",

    "abstract": "We previously reported that differential protein degradation of TKI-sensitive [L858R, del(E746-A750)] and resistant (T790M) epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutants upon erlotinib treatment correlates with drug sensitivity. However, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. We also reported SMAD ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2) ligase activity is important in stabilizing EGFR. Here, using in vitro and in vivo ubiquitination assays, mass spectrometry, and super-resolution microscopy, we show SMURF2-EGFR functional interaction is critical in receptor stability and TKI sensitivity. We found that L858R/T790M EGFR is a preferred substrate of SMURF2-UBCH5 (an E3-E2) complex-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination, which preferentially stabilizes mutant receptor. We identified four lysine (K) residues (K721, 846, 1037 and 1164) as the sites of ubiquitination and replacement of K to acetylation-mimicking asparagine (Q) at K1037 position in L858R/T790M background converts the stable protein sensitive to erlotinib-induced degradation. Using STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (STORM) imaging, we show that SMURF2 presence allows longer membrane retention of activated EGFR upon EGF treatment, whereas, siRNA-mediated SMURF2 knockdown fastens receptor endocytosis and lysosome enrichment. In an erlotinib-sensitive PC9 cells, SMURF2 overexpression increased EGFR levels with improved erlotinib tolerance, whereas, SMURF2 knockdown decreased EGFR steady state levels in NCI-H1975 and PC9-AR cells to overcome erlotinib and AZD-9291 resistance respectively. Additionally, by genetically altering the SMURF2-UBCH5 complex formation destabilized EGFR. Together, we propose that SMURF2-mediated preferential polyubiquitination of L858R/T790M EGFR may be competing with acetylation-mediated receptor internalization to provide enhanced receptor stability and that disruption of the E3-E2 complex may be an attractive alternate to overcome TKI resistance.",

    "abstract": "While host-parasite interactions are ubiquitous, the large scale consequences of parasite infections are mainly driven by the spatial context. One trait of pivotal importance for the eco-evolutionary dynamics of such metapopulations is the spatial behaviour of hosts, that is, their dispersal. It is well established that dispersal is not a random process, rather dispersal is informed and may depend on internal and external factors. In host-parasite metapopulations, dispersal may be a function of a hosts infection state, but also of the local context, such as host density or parasite prevalence. Using a dynamical host-parasite metapopulation model, we explore whether host dispersal evolves to be state- and context-dependent and what shapes the evolutionarily stable dispersal reaction norms have. We show that state-dependent dispersal readily evolves in the sense that hosts disperse more when infected. This dispersal bias evolves due to kin selection which is consistent with previous studies. Most importantly, we show that prevalence-dependent dispersal evolves, especially when virulence is high and epidemiological dynamics have predictable signatures. The observed evolutionary outcome, a negatively prevalence-dependent dispersal reaction norm for susceptible hosts, seems counter-intuitive at first. However, our results can be readily explained by the emergent epidemiological dynamics, especially their spatial and temporal correlation patterns. Finally, we show that context-dependency in dispersal may rely on both, prevalence, but also host density cues. Our work provides new insights into the evolution of complex dispersal phenotypes in host-parasite metapopulations as well as on associated feedbacks between ecological dynamics and evolutionary change.",

Here, we conducted the first test for context-dependent character displacement in multimodal floral signals by analyzing variation in floral scent in a system that exhibits character displacement in flower size, and that has multiple types of sympatric communities. In a greenhouse common garden experiment, we measured quantitative variation in volatile emission rates of the progeny of two species of Clarkia from replicated communities that contain one, two, or four Clarkia species. The first two axes of a constrained correspondence analysis, which explained 24 percent of the total variation in floral scent, separated the species and community types, respectively. Of the 23 compounds that were significantly correlated with these axes, nine showed patterns consistent with character displacement. Two compounds produced primarily by C. unguiculata and two compounds produced primarily by C. cylindrica were emitted in higher amounts in sympatry. Character displacement in some volatiles varied across sympatric communities and occurred in parallel with displacement in flower size, demonstrating that this evolutionary process can be context-dependent and may occur through multiple pathways.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlastome-scale data have been prevalent in reconstructing the plant Tree of Life. However, phylogenomic studies currently based on plastomes rely primarily on maximum likelihood (ML) inference of concatenated alignments of plastid genes, and thus phylogenetic discordance produced by individual plastid genes has generally been ignored. Moreover, structural and functional characteristics of plastomes indicate that plastid genes may not evolve as a single locus and are experiencing different evolutionary forces, yet the genetic characteristics of plastid genes within a lineage remain poorly studied.\n\nResultsWe sequenced and annotated ten plastome sequences of Gentianeae. Phylogenomic analyses yielded robust relationships among genera within Gentianeae. We detected great variation of gene tree topologies and revealed more than half of the genes, including one (atpB) of the three widely used plastid markers (rbcL, atpB and matK) in phylogenetic inference of Gentianeae, are likely contributing to phylogenetic ambiguity of Gentianeae. Estimation of nucleotide substitution rates showed extensive rate heterogeneity among different plastid genes and among different functional groups of genes. Comparative analysis suggested that the ribosomal protein (RPL and RPS) genes and the RNA polymerase (RPO) genes have higher substitution rates and genetic variations in Gentianeae. Our study revealed that just one (matK) of the three (matK, ndhB and rbcL) widely used markers show high phylogenetic informativeness (PI) value. Due to the high PI and lowest gene-tree discordance, rpoC2 is advocated as a promising plastid DNA barcode for taxonomic studies of Gentianeae. Furthermore, our analyses revealed a positive correlation of evolutionary rates with genetic variation of plastid genes, but a negative correlation with gene-tree discordance under purifying selection.\n\nConclusionsOverall, our results demonstrate the heterogeneity of nucleotide substitution rates and genetic characteristics among plastid genes providing new insights into plastome evolution, while highlighting the necessity of considering gene-tree discordance into phylogenomic studies based on plastome-scale data.",

    "abstract": "Current methods for forced expression of selected target genes are based on promoter exchange or on overexpressing native or hybrid transcriptional activators in which gene-specific DNA binding domains are coupled to strong activation domains. While these approaches are very useful for promoters with known or synthetically introduced transcription factor binding sites, they are not suitable to turn on genes in biosynthetic gene clusters which often lack pathway-specific activators. To expand the discovery toolbox, we designed a Cas9-based RNA guided synthetic transcription activation system for Aspergillus nidulans based on enzymatically disabled dCas9 fused to three consecutive activation domains (VPR-dCas9). Targeting two biosynthetic gene clusters involved in the production of secondary metabolites, we demonstrate the utility of the system. Especially in silent regions facultative heterochromatin and strictly positioned nucleosomes can constitute a relevant obstacle to the transcriptional machinery. To avoid this negative impact and to facilitate optimal positioning of RNA-guided VPR-dCas9 to our targeted promoters we have created a genome-wide nucleosome map to identify the cognate nucleosome-free-regions (NFRs). Based on these maps, different single-guide RNAs (sgRNA) were designed and tested for their targeting and activation potential. Our results demonstrate that the system can be used to activate silent BGCs in A. nidulans, partially to very high expression levels and also open the opportunity to stepwise turn on individual genes within a BGC that allows to decipher the correlated biosynthetic pathway.",

    "abstract": "Ergogenic aid is a substance or method used for enhancing exercise and sports performance. Caffeine is the most used ergogenic aid for athletes, but the mechanisms are still unknown. Forty-two adult female (19{+/-}0.6 g) and 40 male mice (24{+/-}0.4 g) from a global and forebrain A2AR knockout and colony (FMUC, University of Coimbra) underwent an open field and ergospirometry exercise test. Caffeine (15 mg/kg, i.p.) and SCH 58261 (1 mg/kg, i.p.) were administered 15 minutes before the animals ran to exhaustion. We also evaluate the estrous cycle and infrared temperature (rest and recovery). Caffeine was psychostimulant in wild type females and males, but we observed this expected effect of SCH-58261 only in males. Caffeine and SCH-58261 were also ergogenic for wild type animals, that is, they increased running power and maximal O2 consumption ([Formula]O2max). The psychostimulant and ergogenic effects of caffeine and SCH-58261 disappeared in A2AR knockout females (global) and males (forebrain). The estrous cycle did not influence any evaluated parameters, as well as exercise-induced hyperthermia was similar between savages and knockouts. Our results suggest that the neuronal A2AR receptors signal the ergogenic effects of caffeine in female and male mice.",

    "abstract": "Sharing human genotype and phenotype data presents a challenge because of privacy concerns, but is essential in order to discover otherwise inaccessible genetic associations. Here we present a method of homomorphic encryption that obscures individuals genotypes and phenotypes and is suited to quantitative genetic association analysis. Encrypted ciphertext and unencrypted plaintext are interchangeable from an analytical perspective. This allows one to store ciphertext on public web services and share data across multiple studies, while maintaining privacy. The encryption method uses as its key a high-dimensional random linear orthogonal transformation that leaves the likelihood of quantitative trait data unchanged under a linear model with normally distributed errors. It also preserves linkage disequilibrium between genetic variants and associations between variants and phenotypes. It scrambles relationships between individuals: encrypted genotype dosages closely resemble Gaussian deviates, and in fact can be replaced by quantiles from a Gaussian with only negligible effects on accuracy. Standard likelihood-based inferences are unaffected by orthogonal encryption. These include the use of mixed linear models to control for unequal relatedness between individuals, the estimation of heritability, and the inclusion of covariates when testing for association. Orthogonal transformations can also be applied in a modular fashion that permits multi-party federated mega-analyses. Under this scheme any number of parties first agree to share a common set of genotype sites and covariates prior to encryption. Each party then privately encrypts and shares their own ciphertext, and analyses the other parties ciphertexts. In the absence of private variants, or knowledge of the key, we show that it is infeasible to decrypt ciphertext using existing brute-force or noise reduction attacks. Therefore, we present the method as a challenge to the community to determine its security.",

    "abstract": "The 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID19 / Wuhan coronavirus), officially named as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA coronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 causes the contagious COVID19 disease also known as 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease and has led to the ongoing 2019-20 pandemic COVID19 outbreak. The effective counter measures against SARS-CoV-2 infection require the design and development of specific and effective vaccine candidate. In the present study, we have screened and shortlisted 38 CTL, 33 HTL and 12 B cell epitopes from the eleven Protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 by utilizing different in silico tools. The screened epitopes were further validated for their binding with their respective HLA allele binders and TAP (Transporter associated with antigen processing) molecule by molecular docking. The shortlisted screened epitopes were further utilized to design novel two multi-epitope vaccines (MEVs) composed of CTL, HTL and B cell epitopes overlaps with potential to elicit humoral as well as cellular immune response against SARS-CoV-2. To enhance the immune response for our vaccine design, truncated (residues 10-153) Onchocerca volvulus activation-associated secreted protein-1 (Ov-ASP-1) has been utilized as an adjuvant at N terminal of both the MEVs. Further molecular models for both the MEVs were prepared and validated for their stable molecular interactions with Toll-Like Receptor 3 (TLR 3). The codon-optimized cDNA of both the MEVs were further analyzed for their potential of high level of expression in a human cell line. The present study is very significant in terms of molecular designing of prospective CTL and HTL vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 infection with the potential to elicit cellular as well as humoral immune response.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure that are largely attributed to the cytokine storm. The surface coronavirus spike (S) glycoprotein is considered as a key factor in host specificity because it mediates infection by receptor-recognition and membrane fusion. Here, the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 S protein revealed two B56-binding LxxIxE-like motifs in S1 and S2 subunits that could recruit the host protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The motif in S1 subunit is absent in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Phosphatases and kinases are major players in the regulation of pro-inflammatory responses during pathogenic infections. Moreover, studies have shown that viruses target PP2A in order to manipulate hosts antiviral responses. Recent researches have indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is involved in sustained host inflammation. Therefore, by controlling acute inflammation, it is possible to eliminate its dangerous effects on the host. Among efforts to fight COVID-19, the interaction between LxxIxE-like motif and the PP2A-B56-binding pocket could be a target for the discovery and/or development of a bioactive ligand inhibitor for therapeutic purposes. Indeed, a small molecule called Artepillin C (ArtC), a main compound in Brazilian honeybee green propolis, mimics the side chains of LxxLxE motif. Importantly, ArtC is known, among other effects, to have anti-inflammatory activity that makes it an excellent candidate for future clinical trials in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances shifted the focus on single-brain functioning toward two-brain communication during learning interactions, following the demonstration that interpersonal brain synchronization (IBS) can track instructor-learner information exchange. Here, we investigated (i) whether sleep deprivation (SD) that potentially impacts both social interactions and learning abilities modulates IBS, and (ii) conversely whether and to what extent IBS might compensate for SD-related learning deficits. Instructors (always with regular sleep, RS) were asked to teach numerical reasoning strategies to learners (either SD or RS), during which the activity of both brains was simultaneously recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). SD learners initially performed below their baseline level, worse than RS learners, but learning improvement was comparable between RS and SD conditions after learning with the instructor. IBS within the instructor-learner dyads was higher in the SD (vs. RS) condition in the left inferior frontal cortex. In addition, clustered IBS (estimated by nonnegative matrix factorization) was correlated with performance improvement. Finally, Granger Causality analyses revealed biased causality with higher instructor-to-learner than learner-to-instructor directionality in brain signal processing. Together, these results indicate that SD-related learning deficits can to some extent be compensated via interactions with an instructor, as reflected by increased IBS and preserved learning ability. It suggests an essential role of the instructor in driving synchrony between teaching and SD learning brains during interactions.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic changes in motor abilities and motivated behaviors occur during the juvenile and adolescent periods. The striatum is a subcortical nucleus critical for action selection, motor learning and reward processing. Its tonically active cholinergic interneuron (ChI) is an integral regulator of the synaptic activity of other striatal neurons, as well as afferent axonal projections of midbrain dopamine neurons. Thalamic and dopaminergic inputs initiate pauses in ChI firing following salient sensory cues that are extended for several hundred milliseconds by intrinsic regenerative currents. Here, we characterize the electrophysiological and morphological features of ChIs during mouse postnatal development. We demonstrate that ChI spontaneous activity increases with age while the duration of the pause in firing induced by depolarizing inputs decreases during postnatal development. Maturation of ChI activity is driven by two distinct physiological changes: decreased amplitude of the afterhypolarization between P14 and P18 and and increased Ih conductance between the late postnatal period and adulthood. Finally, we uncover postnatal changes in dopamine release properties that are mediated by cholinergic signalling. At P10, striatal dopamine release is diminished compared to the adult, but our data show efficient summation of dopamine relase evoked by multiple grouped stimuli that subsides by P28. Blockade of nictonic acetylcholine receptors enhances release summation in mice older than P28 but has little effect at P10. These data demonstrate a physiological maturation of ChI activity and indicate a reciprocal interaction between the postnatal maturation of striatal ChI and dopamine neurotransmission.\n\nSignificance StatementMotor skills and motivated behavior regimes develop rapidly during the postnatal period. The functional development of the striatal cholinergic interneuron (ChI), which contributes to these behaviors in adulthood, remains unexplored. In this study, we tracked the ontogeny of spontaneous ChI activity and cellular morphology, as well as the developmental trajectory of ion conductances characteristic to this population. We further report a developmental link between ChI activity and dopamine release, revealing a change in the frequency-dependence of dopamine release during the early postnatal period that is mediated by cholinergic signaling. This study provides evidence that striatal microcircuits are dynamic during the postnatal period and that they undergo coordinated maturation.",

    "abstract": "The neural basis of language has been studied for centuries, yet the networks critically involved in simply identifying or understanding a spoken word remain elusive. Several functional-anatomical models of critical neural substrates of receptive speech have been proposed, including (1) auditory-related regions in the left mid-posterior superior temporal lobe, (2) motor-related regions in the left frontal lobe (in normal and/or noisy conditions), the left anterior superior temporal lobe, or (4) bilateral mid-posterior superior temporal areas. One difficulty in comparing these models is that they often focus on different aspects of the sound-to-meaning pathway and are supported by different types of stimuli and tasks. Two auditory tasks that are typically used in separate studies--syllable discrimination and word comprehension--often yield different conclusions. We assessed syllable discrimination (words and nonwords) and word comprehension (clear speech and with a noise masker) in 158 individuals with focal brain damage: left (n=113) or right (n=19) hemisphere stroke, left (n=18) or right (n=8) anterior temporal lobectomy, and 26 neurologically-intact controls. Discrimination and comprehension tasks are doubly dissociable both behaviorally and neurologically. In support of a bilateral model, clear speech comprehension was near ceiling in 95% of left stroke cases and right temporal damage impaired syllable discrimination. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses for the syllable discrimination and noisy word comprehension tasks each implicated most of the left superior temporal gyrus (STG). Comprehension but not discrimination tasks also implicated the left pMTG, while discrimination but not comprehension tasks also implicated more dorsal sensorimotor regions in posterior perisylvian cortex.",

Considering the severity of infection and the associated mortalities, there is an urgent need to develop an effective preventive measure against this virus. In this study, we have designed a novel vaccine construct using computational strategies. Spike (S) glycoprotein is the major antigenic component that trigger the host immune responses. Detailed investigation of S protein with various immunoinformatics tools enabled us to identify 5 MHC I and 5 MHC II B-cell derived T-cell epitopes with VaxiJen score > 1 and IC50 value < 100nM. These epitopes were joined with a suitable adjuvant and appropriate linkers to form a multi-epitope based vaccine construct. Further, in silico testing of the vaccine construct for its antigenicity, allergenicity, solubility, and other physicochemical properties showed it to be safe and immunogenic. Suitable tertiary structure of the vaccine protein was generated using 3Dpro of SCRATCH suite, refined with GalaxyRefine, and validated with ProSA, PROCHECK, and ERRAT server. Finally, molecular docking studies were performed to ensure a favorable binding affinity between the vaccine construct and TLR3 receptor. The designed multi-epitope vaccine showed potential to elicit specific immune responses against the SARS-COV-2. However, further wet lab validation is necessary to confirm the actual effectiveness, safety and immunogenic potency of the vaccine construct against derived in this study.",

    "abstract": "Using neural reinforcement, participants can be trained to pair a reward with the activation of specific multivoxel patterns in their brains. In a double-blind placebo-controlled experiment, we previously showed that this intervention can decrease the physiological reactivity associated with naturally feared animals. However, the mechanisms behind the effect remain incompletely understood and its usefulness for treatment remains unclear. If the intervention fundamentally changed the brain responses, we might expect to observe relatively stable changes in the functional connectivity within the threat regulation network. To evaluate this possibility, we conducted functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) sessions while subjects were at rest, before and after neural reinforcement, and quantified the changes in resting-state functional connectivity accordingly. Our results indicate that neural reinforcement increased the connectivity of prefrontal regulatory regions with the amygdala and the ventral temporal cortex (where the visual representations of phobic targets are). Surprisingly, we found no evidence of Hebbian-like learning during neural reinforcement, contrary to what one may expect based on previous neurofeedback studies. These results suggest that multivoxel neural reinforcement, also known as decoded neurofeedback (DecNef), may operate via unique mechanisms, distinct from those involved in conventional neurofeedback.",

Unlike microsaccades, drifts remain to be viewed as largely random eye movements. Here we found that ocular position drifts can, instead, be very systematically stimulus-driven, and with very short latencies. We used highly precise eye tracking in three well trained macaque monkeys and found that even fleeting (~8 ms duration) stimulus presentations can robustly trigger transient and stimulus-specific modulations of ocular position drifts, and with only approximately 60 ms latency. Such drift responses are binocular, and they are most effectively elicited with large stimuli of low spatial frequency. Intriguingly, the drift responses exhibit some image pattern selectivity, and they are not explained by convergence responses, pupil constrictions, head movements, or starting eye positions. Ocular position drifts have very rapid access to exogenous visual information.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal visual experience in critical period causes amblyopia or lazy eye, reducing visual abilities even with corrected optics. A long-standing question is where in the human visual system does the amblyopic deficit arise. In particular, whether amblyopia induces selective deficits of the magnocellular (M) or the parvocellular (P) geniculostriate pathways, and whether the more ancient retinotectal pathway is also affected. Technical limitations to non-invasively measure layer-specific activity in human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and superior colliculus (SC) hampered efforts in addressing these questions. In the current study, using lamina-resolved 3T and 7T fMRI and visual stimuli selectively activating the M and P pathways, we investigated layer-specific response properties of the LGN and the SC of amblyopia patients and normal controls. With stimuli presented to the amblyopic eye, there was a stronger response loss in the P layers than in the M layers of the LGN. Compared to normal controls, amblyopic eyes response to the P stimulus was selectively reduced in the superficial SC, while the fellow eyes response was robustly increased in the deep SC. Selective P response deficits of amblyopia were also observed in the visual pulvinar, early visual cortex, and ventral but not dorsal visual streams. These results provide strong in vivo evidence in adult amblyopic patients for selective deficits of parvocellular functions in the visual thalamus, and additionally reveal response deficits to the amblyopic eye and neural compensation to the fellow eye in the retinotectal pathway.\n\nHighlightsO_LIParvocellular response loss in the LGN P layers, visual pulvinar and ventral visual stream\nC_LIO_LISelective amblyopic deficits of the parvocellular pathway\nC_LIO_LIAmblyopic eyes response decreased in the superficial SC\nC_LIO_LIFellow eyes response increased in the deep SC\nC_LIO_LIAmblyopic deficits and neural compensation in the retinotectal pathway\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Scientific conferences provide valuable opportunities for researchers across career stages and disciplines to present their latest work, and to network with their peers. These meetings have largely been held in-person with rapid proliferation in the number of meetings and attendees. Yet the format and quality of their organization lag behind what is possible and as a result, the current experience of attending conferences in many disciplines remains unchanged in many respects. We created a database of 270 national and international academic conferences held in-person during 2018-2019 in various disciplines and examined them for their features, costs and impact on the community. We found that many meetings could still be improved significantly in terms of diversity, inclusivity, promoting early career researcher (ECR) networking and career development, venue accessibility, and importantly, reducing the meetings carbon footprint. It is important to accelerate and mandate efforts to improve conferences so that researchers in all disciplines, in particular ECRs, consistently benefit from scientific gatherings, for years to come. We discuss a combination of approaches and recommendations to make conferences more modern, effective, equitable and intellectually productive for the research community and environmentally sustainable for our planet.\n\n\"They always say time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself.\"\n\n-- Andy Warhol",

    "abstract": "The complexity of our actions and thinking is likely reflected in functional brain networks. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a popular data-driven method to compute group differences between such networks. To aid interpretation of functional network analyses, Smith and colleagues proposed a template of ten functional networks identified in 36 healthy participants. They labeled them those components according to their similarity with statistical parameter maps from a metaanalysis of task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (Smith et al., 2009). However, those original templates show substantial distortion with respect to what up-to date correction methods can achieve, such that trying to capture relevant effects within several cortical regions, especially the sensorimotor and orbitofrontal cortices, as well as the cerebellum may yield suboptimal results. Here, we provide a technical update and extension to the original templates. Using correlation analyses, we identified the best matching maps of each of the original ten templates to ICA maps from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). The HCP provides group-parcellations of a large dataset (n = 1003) with high-quality data. This approach yields a better fit of spatial component maps with anatomical borders and gray-/white-matter-boundaries. Additionally, we provide a version of the updated templates in CIFTI file-format, an emerging format in the neuroimaging community that combines surface-based data with subcortical/cerebellar data in volumetric space. The two formats we provide here offer an improvement on the templates by Smith et al., which should enhance sensitivity and interpretability of future research that compares functional networks between groups.",

    "abstract": "Charged molecular species, such as ions, play a vital role in the life of the cell. In particular, divalent calcium ions (Ca2+) are critical for activating cellular membranes. Interactions between Ca2+ and anionic phosphatidylserine (PS) lipids result in structural changes of the plasma membrane and are vital for many signaling pathways, such as the tightly regulated blood coagulation cascade. Upon cell damage, PS lipids are externalized to the outer leaflet, where they are not only exposed to Ca2+, but also to proteins. Lactadherin is a glycoprotein, important for cell-adhesion, that can act as an anticoagulant. While a number of experimental studies have been performed on lactadherins C2 domains (LactC2) binding affinity for PS molecules, an atomistic description of LactC2 interactions with PS lipids in the plasma membrane is lacking. We performed extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of mixed lipid bilayers and experimental characterization of LactC2-membrane interactions in the presence and absence of Ca2+ and characterized PS-Ca2+ and PS-LactC2 interactions to guide our understanding of how these interactions initiate and impede blood coagulation, respectively. The captured spontaneously formed long-lived PS-Ca2+ and PS-LactC2 complexes revealed that the protein side chains involved in PS-LactC2 interactions appear to be affected by the presence of Ca2+. The degree of LactC2 insertion into the lipid bilayer also appears to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+. Characterizing the interactions between Ca2+ and LactC2 with PS lipids can lead to a greater understanding of the activation and regulation of the blood coagulation cascade and of the basis of charged species interactions with the lipid membrane.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCELactadherin plays an important role in cellular signaling including blood coagulation. Many of these processes involve lactadherin interacting with the lipids of the cell plasma membrane. Lactadherin acts as an anticoagulant and contributes to a number of health issues. Understanding the interactions that drive lactadherins anticoagulant properties can lead to potential new drug targets.",

    "abstract": "The calculation of nestedness has become a routine analysis in the study of ecological networks, as it is commonly associated with community resilience, robustness and species persistence. While meaningful in species distributional patterns, for an interaction matrix to be nested, specialist species must interact with ordered subsets of subsequently more generalized species -- not just with a lower number of species. However, after reviewing 419 papers on mutualistic networks published since nestedness was introduced for the study of species interactions in 2003, we have found that only two theoretical studies considered explicitly ordered subsets. Instead, most studies interpret nestedness as a core of densely connected generalist species, surrounded by a periphery of specialist species attached to this core -- a so-called core-periphery structure. Such a topological feature is generally perceived as a core-periphery structure in network science. Here, we argue that the concept of core-periphery may be more relevant for studies on mutualistic networks than the concept of nestedness, as ecologists are usually not interested in exploring in detail the ordered subsets that characterize nestedness but instead use nestedness to describe a topology with a core of densely linked generalist species surrounded by a sparsely linked periphery of specialists. To illustrate our arguments and the quantification of core-periphery structures, we calculate core-periphery and nestedness in a large publicly available dataset of mutualistic networks. We also describe the calculation of core-periphery structures, its relationship with nestedness, and provide the code inside the R package econetwork for its calculation in mutualistic networks. We hope that our review will help ecologists to move beyond nestedness towards a more explicit representation of the structure of ecological networks.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWe aim to develop a paradigm for simultaneous and independent control of multiple degrees of freedom (DOFs) for upper-limb prostheses.\n\nApproachWe introduce action control, a novel method to operate prosthetic digits with surface electromyography (EMG) based on multi-label, multi-class classification. At each time step, the decoder classifies movement intent for each controllable DOF into one of three categories: open, close, or stall (i.e., no movement). We implemented a real-time myoelectric control system using this method and evaluated it by running experiments with one unilateral and two bilateral amputees. Participants controlled a six-DOF bar interface on a computer display, with each DOF corresponding to a motor function available in multi-articulated prostheses.\n\nMain resultsWe show that action control can significantly and systematically outperform the state-of-the-art method of position control via multi-output regression in both task- and non-task-related measures. Improvements in median task performance ranged from 20.14% to 62.32% for individual participants. Analysis of a post-experimental survey revealed that all participants rated action higher than position control in a series of qualitative questions and expressed an overall preference for the former.\n\nSignificanceAction control has the potential to improve the dexterity of upper-limb prostheses. In comparison with regression-based systems, it only requires discrete instead of real-valued ground truth labels, typically collected with motion tracking systems. This feature makes the system both practical in a clinical setting and also suitable for bilateral amputation. This work is the first demonstration of myoelectric digit control in bilateral upper-limb amputees. Further investigation and pre-clinical evaluation are required to assess the translational potential of the method.",

    "abstract": "The stimulation of P2X7 receptor by extracellular ATP leads to activation of NLRP3 inflammasome and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Here, we reveal a distinct mechanism by which Paxillin promotes ATP-induced activation of P2X7 receptor and NLRP3 inflammasome. Extracellular ATP induces Paxillin phosphorylation and facilitates Paxillin-NLRP3 interaction. Interestingly, Paxillin enhances NLRP3 deubiquitination and activates NLRP3 inflammasome upon ATP treatment and K+ efflux. Moreover, we reveal that UPS13 is a key enzyme for Paxillin-mediated NLRP3 deubiquitination upon ATP treatment. Notably, extracellular ATP promotes Paxillin and NLRP3 migration from cytosol to plasma membrane and facilitates P2X7-Paxillin interaction and Paxillin-NLRP3 association, resulting in the formation of P2X7-Paxillin-NLRP3 complex. Functionally, Paxillin is essential for ATP-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation in mouse BMDMs and BMDCs as we as in human PBMCs and THP-1-differentiated macrophages. Thus, Paxillin plays key roles in ATP-induced activation of P2X7 receptor and NLRP3 inflammasome by facilitating the formation of the P2X7-Paxillin-NLRP3 complex.",

Peroxisome abundance was measured by PMP-70 protein expression. 48hrs post transfection, cells were incubated with or without 250M palmitate for a further 48hrs before measurement of reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial respiratory function, and glucose stimulated insulin secretion.\n\nResultsPex11{beta} knockdown decreased target gene expression by more than 80% compared with the scrambled control (P<0.001), leading to decreased PMP-70 expression (p<0.01). Pex11{beta} knockdown decreased palmitate mediated generation of reactive oxygen species (P<0.001), but with no effect on mitochondrial respiratory function.

    "abstract": "Plant-pollinator interactions are key for ecosystem maintenance and world crop production, and their occurrence depends on the synchronization of life-cycle events among interacting species. Phenological shifts observed for plant and pollinator species increase the risk of phenological mismatches, threatening community stability. However, the magnitudes and directions of phenological shifts present a high variability, both among communities and among species of the same community. Community-wide consequences of these different responses have not been explored. Additionally, variability in phenological and topological traits of species can affect their persistence probability under phenological changes. We explored the consequences of several scenarios of plant-pollinator phenological mismatches for community stability. We also assessed whether species attributes can predict species persistence under phenological mismatch. To this end, we used a dynamic model for plant-pollinator networks. The model incorporates active and latent life-cycle states of species and phenological dynamics regulating life-cycle transitions. Interaction structure and species phenologies were extracted from eight empirical plant-pollinator networks sampled at three locations during different periods. We found that for all networks and all scenarios, species persistence decreased with increasing magnitude of the phenological shift, for both advancements and delays in flowering phenologies. Changes in persistence depended on the scenario and the network being tested. However, all networks exhibited the lowest species persistence when the mean of the expected shift was equivalent to its standard deviation and this shift was greater than two weeks. Conversely, the highest species persistences occurred when earlier-flowering plants exhibited stronger shifts. Phenophase duration was the most important attribute as a driver of plant persistence. For pollinator persistence, species degree was the most important attribute, followed by phenophase duration. Our findings highlight the importance of phenologies on the stability and robustness of mutualistic networks.\n\nAuthor summaryPlant-pollinator interactions involve a great number of species and are essential for the functioning of natural and agricultural systems. These interactions are facing a great number of threats. In both plants and pollinators, life-cycle events including flowering and adult emergence are triggered by environmental cues such as temperature and snowmelt. Climate change has the potential to alter the timing of these events. These phenological shifts generate mismatches in the timing of interacting species. Thus, plants and their pollinators may not match in time and/or space, leaving flowers unpollinated and disrupting pollinator feeding. Given that natural communities are composed of multiple species interacting in complex ways, experimentally assessing the effects of this kind of perturbation is difficult. To tackle this challenge, we simulated different scenarios of phenological shifts for several empirical communities. Our results indicate that strong shifts in the timing of life-cycle events may represent a greater risk of community collapse. Likewise, plants with short blooming periods and pollinators with short activity periods or high specialization face a greater risk of extinction.",

    "abstract": "Myelin is composed of plasma membrane spirally wrapped around axons and compacted into dense sheaths by myelin associated proteins. In the central nervous system (CNS), myelin is elaborated by neuroepithelial derived oligodendrocytes and in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) by neural crest derived Schwann cells. While some myelin proteins are unique to only one lineage, myelin basic protein (Mbp) is expressed in both. Overlapping the Mbp gene is Golli, a transcriptional unit that is expressed widely both within and beyond the nervous system. A super-enhancer domain within the Golli/Mbp locus contains multiple enhancers shown previously to drive reporter construct expression specifically in oligodendrocytes or Schwann cells. In order to determine the contribution of each enhancer to the Golli/Mbp expression program and examine if interactions among these enhancers occur, we derived mouse lines in which enhancers were deleted, either singly or in different combinations, and relative mRNA accumulation was measured at key stages of development. Although super-enhancers have been shown to facilitate interaction among their component enhancers, the enhancers investigated here demonstrated functions that were largely additive. However, enhancers demonstrating autonomous activity strictly in one cell lineage, when missing, were found to significantly reduce output in the other thus revealing cryptic \"stealth\" activity. Further, Golli accumulation in all cell types investigated was markedly and uniformly attenuated by the absence of a key oligodendrocyte enhancer. Our observations expose a novel level of enhancer interaction and are consistent with a model in which enhancer-mediated DNA looping underlies higher-order Golli/Mbp regulatory organization.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe control of transcription is mediated through regulatory sequences that engage in a lineage and developmentally contextual manner. The Golli/Mbp locus gives rise to several mRNAs and while Mbp mRNAs accumulate exclusively in the two glial cell types that elaborate myelin, Golli mRNAs accumulate in diverse cell types both within and beyond the nervous system. To determine how the different Golli/Mbp enhancers distribute their activities and to reveal if they operate as autonomous agents or have functionally significant interactions with each other we derived multiple enhancer knock-out lines. Comparing the developmental accumulation of Mbp and Golli mRNAs revealed that the autonomous targeting capacity of multiple enhancers accurately predicted their in-situ contributions. Also, they acted in a largely additive manner indicating significant individual autonomy that can be accounted for by a simple chromatin looping model. Unexpectedly, we also uncovered cryptic \"stealth\" activity emanating from these same enhancers in lineages where they show no autonomous targeting capacity thus providing new insight into the control of lineage specific gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The ability of the endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis to restrict RNA viruses is presently being leveraged to curb global transmission of arbovirus-induced diseases. Past studies have shown that virus replication is limited early in arthropod cells colonized by the bacterium, although it is unclear if this phenomenon is replicated in mosquito cells that first encounter viruses obtained through a vertebrate blood meal. Furthermore, these cellular events neither explain how Wolbachia limits dissemination of viruses between mosquito tissues, nor how it prevents transmission of infectious viruses from mosquitoes to vertebrate host. In this study, we try to address these issues using an array of mosquito cell culture models, with an additional goal being to identify a common viral target for pathogen blocking. Our results establish the viral RNA as a cellular target for Wolbachia- mediated inhibition, with the incoming viral RNA experiencing rapid turnover following internalization in cells. This early block in replication in mosquito cells initially infected by the virus thus consequently reduces the production of progeny viruses from these same cells. However, this is not the only contributor to pathogen blocking. We show that the presence of Wolbachia reduces the per-particle infectivity of progeny viruses on naive mosquito and vertebrate cells, consequently limiting virus dissemination and transmission, respectively. Importantly, we demonstrate that this aspect of pathogen blocking is independent of any particular Wolbachia-host association and affects viruses belonging to Togaviridae and Flaviviridae families of RNA viruses. Finally, consistent with the idea of the viral RNA as a target, we find that the encapsidated virion RNA is less infectious for viruses produced from Wolbachia-colonized cells. Collectively, our findings present a common mechanism of pathogen blocking in mosquitoes that establish a link between virus inhibition in the cell to virus dissemination and transmission.\n\nAUTHORS SUMMARYViruses transmitted by arthropod vectors pose a significant global health risk. Incidence of diseases caused by these viruses can thus be reduced by implementing effective vector control strategies. This need is further exacerbated due to the lack of commercially available vaccines and antivirals. Presence of the intracellular bacteria Wolbachia pipientis is associated with virus inhibition in multiple mosquito vectors. Furthermore, Wolbachia is inherited transovarially and spreads across the vector population like a natural gene drive, making it an attractive vector control agent. In this study, we examine how the presence of the bacterium in arthropod cells prevents initial establishment of vertebrate cell derived viruses. Our results indicate rapid turnover of incoming viral RNA very early during infection in Wolbachia-colonized cells, thus establishing it as a cellular target for pathogen blocking. Additionally, upon evaluating how these events might further limit virus spread, we find that infectivity of progeny viruses belonging to multiple RNA virus families are reduced on a per-particle basis. This aspect of virus inhibition is independent of any particular Wolbachia-host association and affects how these viruses replicate in naive mosquito and vertebrate cells, thus providing a collective basis of reduced virus dissemination and transmission in Wolbachia-colonized mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundToombak, saffa and saod are the common local name of Sudanese smokeless tobacco which used by large population in different regions in Sudan. That chemical nature of Toomback includes very high levels of carcinogenic substances, strong alkaline materials and microorganisms. The used of Toombak implying application of the highly addictive product in the mouth many times per day for long times differed from users to other.\n\nObjectivesThe objective of this study was to study the effect of Toombak on the oral microbial flora (Microbiota).\n\nMaterials and Methods100 buccal swabs were collected in this study, 50 swabs from Toombak users and 50 swabs from non Toombak users as control group. All the participants were non smokers. The swabs were cultured on Chocolate agar, Blood agar and Sabouraud agar and incubated aerobically for up to 7 days. Then colonial morphology, indirect microscopy and biochemical tests were used to identify the isolated organism.\n\nResultsToomback shows inhibitory effect on the viridanas streptococci and the baccual swabs collected from toomback users show significant increase in number of mixed growth (P value 0.000/ likelihood ratio 43.24) and colonization of oral cavity with Bacillus species (P value 0.000/ likelihood ratio 57.41), Aspergillus species (P value 0.003/ likelihood ratio 10.462) and Aspergillus flavus (P value 0.036/ likelihood ratio 4.45).\n\nConclusionToombak using is affecting the quality and quantity of the oral normal flora because it has inhibitory effect on viridians streptococci, leading to rising of new colonizing species such as Bacillus species and Aspergillus specie especially aflatoxins producing Aspergillus flavus. These changes in the microenvironment may affect the immunity and health of the Toombak users and may lead to serious oral and systemic health problems.",

    "abstract": "Functional interpretation is crucial when facing on average 20,000 missense variants per human exome, as the great majority are not associated with any underlying disease. In silico bioinformatics tools can predict the deleteriousness of variants or assess their functional impact by assigning scores, but they cannot predict whether the variant in question results in gain or loss of function at the protein level. Here, we show that machine learning can effectively predict this biological function polarity of missense variants. The new method adapts weighted gradient boosting machine approach on a set of damaging variants (1,288 loss of function and 218 gain of function variants) as annotated by the tools SIFT, PolyPhen2 and CADD. Area under the ROC curve of 0.85 illustrates high discriminative power of the classifier. Predictive performance of the classifier remains consistent against an independent set of damaging variants as highlighted by the area under the ROC curve of 0.83. This new approach may help to guide biological experiments on the clinical relevance of damaging genetic variants.\n\nAuthor summaryMissense variant occurs when a single genetic alteration in DNA takes place and as a result a new amino acid is translated into the protein. This amino acid change can inactivate the existing protein function causing loss-of-function or produce a new function causing gain-of-function. Therefore, it is very important to interpret these functional consequences of missense variants as they often turn out to be disease causing. Each individuals genome sequence has thousands of missense variants, out of which very few are actually associated with any underlying disease. Various computational tools have been developed to predict whether missense variants are damaging or not, but none of them can actually predict whether the damaging missense variants cause gain-of-function or loss-of-function. We have developed a new ensemble classifier to predict this biological function polarity at the protein level. The classifier combines the prediction scores of three existing bioinformatics tools and applies machine learning to make effective predictions. We have validated our classifier against an independent data set to show its high predictive power and robustness. The predictions made by our machine learning tool can be used as indicators of biological function polarity, but with further evidence on pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "For any given bacteriophage genome or phage sequences in metagenomic data sets, we are unable to assign a function to 50-90% of genes. Structural protein-encoding genes constitute a large fraction of the average phage genome and are among the most divergent and difficult-to-identify genes using homology-based methods. To understand the functions encoded by phages, their contributions to their environments, and to help gauge their utility as potential phage therapy agents, we have developed a new approach to classify phage ORFs into ten major classes of structural proteins or into an \"other\" category. The resulting tool is named PhANNs (Phage Artificial Neural Networks). We built a database of 538,213 manually curated phage protein sequences that we split into eleven subsets (10 for cross-validation, one for testing) using a novel clustering method that ensures there are no homologous proteins between sets yet maintains the maximum sequence diversity for training. An Artificial Neural Network ensemble trained on features extracted from those sets reached a test F1-score of 0.875 and test accuracy of 86.2%. PhANNs can rapidly classify proteins into one of the ten classes, and non-phage proteins are classified as \"other\", providing a new approach for functional annotation of phage proteins. PhANNs is open source and can be run from our web server or installed locally.\n\nAuthor SummaryBacteriophages (phages, viruses that infect bacteria) are the most abundant biological entity on Earth. They outnumber bacteria by a factor of ten. As phages are very different within them and from bacteria, and we have comparatively few phage genes in our database, we are unable to assign function to 50%-90% of phage genes. In this work, we developed PhANNs, a machine learning tool that can classify a phage gene as one of ten structural roles, or \"other\". This approach does not require a similar gene to be known.",

    "abstract": "The most widely used Western blotting protein standards are prestained proteins of known molecular mass (kDa). They are also utilized for sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (PAGE) to determine the molecular mass of proteins separated by electrophoresis. The objective of this study was to assess the reliability of different commercially available protein standards in predicting accurate protein molecular weights. We performed this experiment by running Criterion TGX gels with five prestained protein standards (Thermo Fisher SeeBlue Plus 2, Bio-Rad Precision Plus Protein Dual-color, Thermo Fisher Spectra Multi-color, Novex-Sharp Pre-stained, and Invitrogen iBright Pre-Stained). To evaluate their accuracy, we utilized highly purified Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA, 66.44 kDa) and Cytochrome C (Cyto C, 11.62 kDa). We also made use of the dimers of BSA (132.88 kDa) and Cyt C (23.24 kDa) that are present on SDS-PAGE gels. Our results suggest that three of the standards were less accurate at higher molecular masses with the iBright marker having the highest error in determining the expected 132.88 kDa molecular weight. The SeeBlue Plus 2 was accurate at identifying the 132.88 kDa molecular weight protein band but was less reliable for the three other lower molecular weight proteins. These findings have significant implications for the determination of protein masses because researchers rely on these standards to evaluate the molecular masses of their protein(s). We suggest that at least two different protein standards should be initially used in electrophoresis gels and for Western blotting in order to get accurate protein molecular weight results.",

    "abstract": "Cereal grains, primarily composed of starch, protein, and fat, are major source of staple for human and animal nutrition. Sorghum, a cereal crop, serves as a dietary staple for over half a billion people in the semi-arid tropics of Africa and South Asia. Genomic prediction has enabled plant breeders to estimate breeding values of unobserved genotypes and environments. Therefore, the use of genomic prediction will be extremely valuable for compositional traits for which phenotyping is labor-intensive and destructive for most accurate results. We studied the potential of Bayesian multi-output regressor stacking (BMORS) model in improving prediction performance over single trait single environment (STSE) models using a grain sorghum diversity panel (GSDP) and a biparental recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population. A total of five highly correlated grain composition traits: amylose, fat, gross energy, protein and starch, with genomic heritability ranging from 0.24 to 0.59 in the GSDP and 0.69 to 0.83 in the RILs were studied. Average prediction accuracies from the STSE model were within a range of 0.4 to 0.6 for all traits across both populations except amylose (0.25) in the GSDP. Prediction accuracy for BMORS increased by 41% and 32% on average over STSE in the GSDP and RILs, respectively. Predicting whole environments by training with remaining environments in BMORS yielded higher average prediction accuracy than from STSE model. Our results show regression stacking methods such as BMORS have potential to accurately predict unobserved individuals and environments, and implementation of such models can accelerate genetic gain.",

    "abstract": "Bordetella bronchiseptica and Bordetella pertussis are closely related respiratory pathogens that evolved from a common bacterial ancestor. While B. bronchiseptica has an environmental reservoir and mostly establishes chronic infections in a broad range of mammals, B. pertussis is a human-specific pathogen causing acute pulmonary pertussis in infants and whooping cough illness in older humans. Both species employ a type III secretion system (T3SS) to inject a cytotoxic BteA effector protein into host cells. However, compared to the high BteA-mediated cytotoxicity of B. bronchiseptica, the cytotoxicity induced by B. pertussis BteA (Bp BteA) appears to be quite low and this has been attributed to the reduced T3SS gene expression in B. pertussis. We show that presence of an alanine residue inserted at position 503 (A503) of Bp BteA accounts for its strongly attenuated cytotoxic potency. Deletion of A503 from Bp BteA greatly enhanced the cytotoxic activity of B. pertussis B1917 on mammalian HeLa cells and expression of Bp BteA{Delta}A503 was highly toxic to Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Vice versa, insertion of A503 into B. bronchiseptica BteA (Bb BteA) strongly decreased its cytotoxicity to yeast and HeLa cells. Moreover, production of Bp BteA{Delta}A503 increased virulence of B. pertussis B1917 in the mouse model of intranasal infection (reduced LD50) but yielded less inflammatory pathology in infected mouse lungs at sublethal infectious doses. This suggests that A503 insertion in the T3SS effector Bp BteA may represent an evolutionary adaptation that fine-tunes B. pertussis virulence and host immune response.\n\nAuthor summaryPertussis remains the least-controlled vaccine-preventable infectious disease and the mechanisms by which Bordetella pertussis subverts defense mechanisms of human airway mucosa remain poorly understood. We found that B. pertussis had the cytotoxic activity of its type III secretion system-delivered effector BteA strongly attenuated by insertion of an alanine residue at position 503 as compared to the BteA homologue of the animal pathogen B. bronchiseptica. This functional adaptation reduced the capacity of B. pertussis to suppress host inflammatory response and may contribute to an acute course of the pulmonary form of human infant pertussis.",

This study aimed at determine the whole genome sequences of multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli isolated in a Pastoralist Community of Western Uganda: phylogenomic changes, virulence and resistant genes.\n\nMethodsThis was a laboratory based cross sectional study. Bacterial isolates analyzed in this study were 42 multidrug resistant E. coli isolated from stool samples from both humans and cattle in pastoralist communities collected between January 2018-March 2019. Most of the isolates (41/42) were resistant to three or more antibiotics (multi-drug resistant) and 21/42 isolates were ESBL producers; 13/42 from human and 8/42 from cattle. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) was carried out at the facilities of Kenya Medical Research Institute-Wellcome trust, Kilifi, to determine the phylogenomic changes, virulence and resistant genes.\n\nResultsThe genomes of the human E. coli generally clustered together and away from those of cattle origin. The E. coli isolates were assigned to eight different phylogroups: A, B1, B2, Cladel, D, E, F and G, with a majority being assigned to phylogroup A; while most of the animal isolates were assigned to phylogroup B1. The carriage of multiple AMR genes was higher from the E. coli population from humans than those from cattle. Among these were Beta-lactamase; blaOXA-1: Class D beta-lactamases; blaTEM-1, blaTEM-235: Beta-lactamase; catA1: chloramphenicol acetyl transferase; cmlA1: chloramphenicol efflux transporter; dfrA1, dfrA12, dfrA14, dfrA15, dfrA17, dfrA5, dfrA7, dfrA8: macrolide phosphotransferase; oqxB11: RND efflux pump conferring resistance to fluoroquinolone; qacL, qacEdelta1: quinolone efflux pump; qnrS1: quinolone resistance gene; sul1, sul2, sul3: sulfonamide resistant; tet(A), tet(B): tetracycline efflux pump.\n\nA high variation of virulence genes was registered among the E. coli genomes from humans than those of cattle origin.\n\nConclusionThe E. coli of human and cattle origin are largely independent with different ancestral origins. Limited sharing of strains and resistance genes presents a challenge to the hypothesis that AMR in humans is as a result of antibiotic misuse on the farm.",

The two regions differ strongly in precipitation, temperature, elevation, and topography, all of which are correlated at the regional scale.
