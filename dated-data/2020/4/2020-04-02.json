    "abstract": "Apis cerana cerana, a subspecies of eastern honey, Apis cerana, plays a specific role in beekeeping industry and ecosystem in China and other Asian countries. Larvae of A. c. cerana can be infected by Ascosphaera apis, the fungal pathogen of chalkbrood. In this article, normal 4-, 5-, and 6-day-old larval guts (AcCK1, AcCK2, AcCK3) and A. apis-infected 4-, 5- and 6-day-old larval guts (AcT1, AcT2, AcT3) of A. c. cerana workers were respectively harvested followed by DNA isolation, bisulfite conversion, cDNA library construction and Illumina sequencing. Based on genome-wide bisulfite sequencing, 79167210, 82175052, 79331489, 81051009, 74742842 and 74849091 raw reads were generated from AcCK1, AcCK2, AcCK3, AcT1, AcT2 and AcT3, and after quality control, 73417030 (92.73%), 76660370 (93.27%), 71804727 (90.44%), 75046507 (92.82%), 67487782 (90.30%) and 67367023 (90.04%) clean reads were obtained, respectively.

    "abstract": "Despite the recent progress, our understanding of the principles of plant genome organization and its dynamics in three-dimensional space of interphase nuclei remains limited. In this study, DNA replication timing and interphase chromosome positioning was analyzed in seven Poaceae species differing in genome size. A multidisciplinary approach combining newly replicated DNA labelling by EdU, nuclei sorting by flow cytometry, three-dimensional immuno-FISH, and confocal microscopy revealed similar replication timing order for telomeres and centromeres as well as for euchromatin and heterochromatin in all seven species. The Rabl configuration of chromosomes that lay parallel to each other and their centromeres and telomeres are localized at opposite nuclear poles, was observed in wheat, oat, rye and barley with large genomes, as well as in Brachypodium with a small genome. On the other hand, chromosomes of rice with a small genome and maize with relatively large genome did not assume proper Rabl configuration. In all species, the interphase chromosome positioning inferred from the location of centromeres and telomeres was stable throughout the interphase. These observations extend earlier studies indicating a more complex relation between genome size and interphase chromosome positioning, which is controlled by factors currently not known.\n\nHighlightTelomere and centromere replication timing and interphase chromosome positioning in seven grass species differing in genome size indicates a more complex relation between genome size and the chromosome positioning.",

    "abstract": "The Allee effect describes populations that deviate from logistic growth models and arises in applications including ecology and cell biology. A common justification for incorporating Allee effects into population models is that the population in question has altered growth mechanisms at some critical density, often referred to as a threshold effect. Despite the ubiquitous nature of threshold effects arising in various biological applications, the explicit link between local threshold effects and global Allee effects has not been considered. In this work, we examine a continuum population model that incorporates threshold effects in the local growth mechanisms. We show that this model gives rise to a diverse family of Allee effects and we provide a comprehensive analysis of which choices of local growth mechanisms give rise to specific Allee effects. Calibrating this model to a recent set of experimental data describing the growth of a population of cancer cells provides an interpretation of the threshold population density and growth mechanisms associated with the population.",

    "abstract": "Migratory cells are known to adapt to environments that contain wide-ranging levels of chemoattractant. While biochemical models of adaptation have been previously proposed, here we discuss a different mechanism based on mechanosensing, where the interaction between biochemical signaling and cell tension facilitates adaptation. We describe and analyze a model of mechanochemical-based adaptation coupling a mechanics-based physical model of cell tension coupled with the wave-pinning reaction-diffusion model for Rac activity. Mathematical analysis of this model, simulations of a simplified 1D cell geometry, and 2D finite element simulations of deforming cells reveal that as a cell protrudes under the influence of high stimulation levels, tension mediated inhibition of GTPase signaling causes the cell to polarize even when initially over-stimulated. Specifically, tension mediated inhibition of GTPase activation, which has been experimentally observed in recent years, facilitates this adaptation by countering the high levels of environmental stimulation. These results demonstrate how tension related mechanosensing may provide an alternative (and potentially complementary) mechanism for cell adaptation.\n\nStatement of SignificanceMigratory cells such as human neutrophils encounter environments that contain wide-ranging levels of chemoattractant. In order to move, these cells must maintain an organized front-rear signaling polarity despite this wide variation in environmental stimuli. Past research has demonstrated a number of biochemical based mechanisms by which cells adapt to variable signal levels. Here we demonstrate that the interplay between Rho GTPase signaling and tension mediated feedbacks may provide an alternative mechanochemical mechanism for adaptation to high levels of signaling.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 as available from publicly available repositories suggests the presence of 3 prevalent groups of viral episomes (super-clades), which are mostly associated with outbreaks in distinct geographic locations (China, USA and Europe). While levels of genomic variability between SARS-CoV-2 isolates are limited, to our knowledge, it is not clear whether the observed patterns of variability in viral super-clades reflect ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2, or merely genetic drift and founder effects. Here, we analyze more than 1100 complete, high quality SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, and provide evidence for the absence of distinct evolutionary patterns/signatures in the genomes of the currently known major clades of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses suggest that the presence of distinct viral episomes at different geographic locations are consistent with founder effects, coupled with the rapid spread of this novel virus. We observe that while cross species adaptation of the virus is associated with hypervariability of specific protein coding regions (including the RDB domain of the spike protein), the more variable genomic regions between extant SARS-CoV-2 episomes correspond with the 3 and 5 UTRs, suggesting that at present viral protein coding genes should not be subjected to different adaptive evolutionary pressures in different viral strains. Although this study can not be conclusive, we believe that the evidence presented here is strongly consistent with the notion that the biased geographic distribution of SARS-CoV-2 isolates should not be associated with adaptive evolution of this novel pathogen.",

Some of these proteins, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymers, helicase and main protease, are well conserved between SARS-CoV-2 and the original SARS virus, but several others are not. This study examines one of the proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 that is most different, a macrodomain of nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Although 26% of the amino acids in this SARS-CoV-2 macrodomain differ from those seen in other coronaviruses, biochemical and structural data reveal that the protein retains the ability to bind ADP-ribose, which is an important characteristic of beta coronaviruses, and potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Two notable features have been identified in the SARS-CoV-2 genome: (1) the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2; (2) a unique insertion of twelve nucleotide or four amino acids (PRRA) at the S1 and S2 boundary. For the first feature, the similar RBD identified in SARs-like virus from pangolin suggests the RBD in SARS-CoV-2 may already exist in animal host(s) before it transmitted into human. The left puzzle is the history and function of the insertion at S1/S2 boundary, which is uniquely identified in SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we identified two variants from the first Guangdong SARS-CoV-2 cell strain, with deletion mutations on polybasic cleavage site (PRRAR) and its flank sites. More extensive screening indicates the deletion at the flank sites of PRRAR could be detected in 3 of 68 clinical samples and half of 22 in vitro isolated viral strains. These data indicate (1) the deletion of QTQTN, at the flank of polybasic cleavage site, is likely benefit the SARS-CoV-2 replication or infection in vitro but under strong purification selection in vivo since it is rarely identified in clinical samples; (2) there could be a very efficient mechanism for deleting this region from viral genome as the variants losing 23585-23599 is commonly detected after two rounds of cell passage. The mechanistic explanation for this in vitro adaptation and in vivo purification processes (or reverse) that led to such genomic changes in SARS-CoV-2 requires further work. Nonetheless, this study has provided valuable clues to aid further investigation of spike protein function and virus evolution. The deletion mutation identified in vitro isolation should be also noted for current vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global public health concern due to relatively easy person-to-person transmission and the current lack of effective antiviral therapy. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis remain largely unknown. We exploited an integrated proteomics approach to systematically investigate intra-viral and virus-host interactomes for the identification of unrealized SARS-CoV-2 host targets and participation of cellular proteins in the response to viral infection using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from COVID-19 patients. Using this approach, we elucidated 251 host proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2 and more than 200 host proteins that are significantly perturbed in COVID-19 derived PBMCs. From the interactome, we further identified that non-structural protein nsp9 and nsp10 interact with NKRF, a NF-[Kcy]B repressor, and may precipitate the strong IL-8/IL-6 mediated chemotaxis of neutrophils and overexuberant host inflammatory response observed in COVID-19 patients. Our integrative study not only presents a systematic examination of SARS-CoV-2-induced perturbation of host targets and cellular networks to reflect disease etiology, but also reveals insights into the mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 triggers cytokine storms and represents a powerful resource in the quest for therapeutic intervention.",

To test this hypothesis, we generated RNA-seq libraries from human olfactory neuroepithelia, in which we found substantial expression of the genes coding for the virus receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), and for the virus internalization enhancer TMPRSS2. We analyzed a human olfactory single-cell RNA-seq dataset and determined that sustentacular cells, which maintain the integrity of olfactory sensory neurons, express ACE2 and TMPRSS2. We then observed that the ACE2 protein was highly expressed in a subset of sustentacular cells in human and mouse olfactory tissues. Finally, we found ACE2 transcripts in specific brain cell types, both in mice and humans. Sustentacular cells thus represent a potential entry door for SARS-CoV-2 in a neuronal sensory system that is in direct connection with the brain.",

    "abstract": "In spite of the recent focus on the development of novel targeted drugs to treat cancer, cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the standard treatment for the vast majority of patients. Unfortunately, chemotherapy is associated with high hematopoietic toxicity that may limit its efficacy. We have previously established potential strategies to mitigate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (a lack of circulating neutrophils) using a mechanistic model of granulopoiesis to predict the interactions defining the neutrophil response to chemotherapy and to define optimal strategies for concurrent chemotherapy/prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Here, we extend our analyses to include monocyte production by constructing and parameterizing a model of monocytopoiesis. Using data for neutrophil and monocyte concentrations during chemotherapy in a large cohort of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, we leveraged our model to determine the relationship between the monocyte and neutrophil nadirs during cyclic chemotherapy. We show that monocytopenia precedes neutropenia by 3 days, and rationalize the use of G-CSF during chemotherapy by establishing that the onset of monocytopenia can be used as a clinical marker for G-CSF dosing post-chemotherapy. This work therefore has important clinical applications as a comprehensive approach to understanding the relationship between monocyte and neutrophils after cyclic chemotherapy with or without G-CSF support.",

In the cortical somatosensory network, neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) show invariant sensory responses, while frontal lobe neuron responses correlate with the animals perceptual behavior. But, where in the cortical somatosensory network are the sensory inputs transformed into perceptual behavior? Here, we report that in the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), neurons with invariant sensory responses coexist with neurons whose responses correlate with the animals perceptual behavior. These distinct neural responses exhibit analogous timescales of intrinsic fluctuations, suggesting that they belong to the same hierarchical processing stage. Furthermore, during a non-demanding control task, the sensory responses remained unaltered while perceptual responses vanished. Conclusively, the S2 population responses exhibit intermediate dynamics between S1 and frontal lobe neurons. These results suggest that the conversion of touch into perception crucially depends on S2.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory interactions between the visual and motor systems are robustly found during the transient stimulation of either system. However, it is unknown how such interactions operate if both systems are continuously and simultaneously activated. To test this, we engaged the visual-oculomotor system in 14 right-handers with a large moving striped pattern that elicits characteristic eye movement responses, the optokinetic nystagmus (OKN). We also engaged the motor system with dynamic handgrip exercise simultaneous to OKN. We hypothesised that central versus occipital EEG upper-alpha (10-12 Hz) synchronisation would reflect systems-level inhibition between visual and motor processes. Optokinetic responses were recorded with eye tracking, and gripping force measured with dynamometry. First, when exploring whether continuous visual activation inhibits motor activity, we found that OKN increased alpha synchronisation over central electrodes, in line with classic findings of motor downregulation to transient visual stimuli. We found further evidence for the visual inhibition of motor-cortical activity, by comparing between visual conditions: increasing visual input, from closed eyes, to eye opening, to visual stimulation, produced progressively greater motor synchronisation into the inhibitory upper-alpha band. Second, we tested for the opposite interaction, that is, effects of motor engagement over ongoing visual and oculomotor processes. Behaviourally, left hand-grip exercise accelerated the ongoing OKN, increasing slow phase velocity. Electrophysiologically, performing this repetitive motor task with either hand interfered the occipital alpha desynchronization that OKN normally induces on EEG. These results support that mutual visual and motor inhibitory interactions persist during their simultaneous engagement, and show their effects on eye movements.\n\nKey pointsO_LIIncreasing levels of visual activation produced increasingly stronger signs of cortical inhibition.\nC_LIO_LIHand motor activation interfered with visual cortical activation during visual stimulation.\nC_LIO_LIHand motor activation altered oculomotor responses.\nC_LIO_LIOngoing visual-motor interactions were reflected by the EEG alpha band.\nC_LIO_LIEEG can be reliably assessed during nystagmus.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions often require the integration of noisy sensory evidence over time. This process is formalized with sequential sampling models, where evidence is accumulated up to a decision threshold before a choice is made. Although intuition suggests that decision formation must precede the preparation of a motor response (i.e., the action used to communicate the choice), neurophysiological findings have suggested that these two processes might be one and the same. To test this idea, we developed a reverse-correlation protocol in which the visual stimuli that influence decisions can be distinguished from those guiding motor responses. In three experiments, we found that the temporal weighting function of oculomotor responses did not overlap with the relatively early weighting function of stimulus properties having an impact on decision formation. These results support a timeline in which perceptual decisions are formed, at least in part, prior to the preparation of a motor response.",

This article was a continued data report of aging-related N-d alterations in aged dog. N-d positivity in aged spinal cord has revealed a certain of morphological profiles in the spinal cord of several species. However, we still found some denoted N-d neurodegenerative changes that we failed to notice in our previous studies when re-examination of the sacral spinal cord of aged dog. In the horizontal section, spacing spheroids in the superficial laminae of the dorsal horn, curl-up and coiled neurites in the intermediate zone were detected in the sacral spinal cord. The ANB and vacuolar neurite were also detected. Vacuolar degeneration also occurred in the dorsal ganglia at the sacral segment. The curl-up and coiled neurites did not occur in the lumbothoracic segment, but the ANB and vacuolar neurite were scatteringly detected in in the lumbothoracic segment of aged dog. The results suggested that the N-d sensory inputs interrupted and disconnected with integration of autonomic centers and output circuits of regulating urogenital organs during the aging. These specialized profiles were speculated that the N-d neurite deterioration of visceral sensory circuit implicated dysfunction of pelvic organs in the aging.

    "abstract": "Today, second generation anti-psychotics such as clozapine and risperidone are the favored treatment for schizophrenia. Yet, the absence of relevant biomarkers that can decode their neurobiological effect shackles our ability to accurately predict and track response to treatment. While researchers have investigated DNA methylation as a biomarker for schizophrenia risk, none have performed a systematic analysis of the effect of antipsychotics upon DNA methylation. We hypothesize that disease-related methylation changes occur before treatment, and that acute antipsychotic treatment may affect DNA methylation. We designed a longitudinal DNA methylation study to estimate risperidones effect on DNA methylation and how changes in DNA methylation might influence risperidones therapeutic effect on behavioral and neuroimaging phenotypes. Thirty-eight patients with first-episode drug-naive schizophrenia (FES) and 38 demographically-matched individuals (healthy controls) participated. We identified brain related pathways enriched in 8,204 FES-associated methylation sites. Risperidone administration altered methylation in 6,143 CpG DNA sites. Post-treatment FES associated with methylation in 6760 CpG sites. Majority of the DNA methylation changes were treatment effect in the overall CpG sites, the FES associated CpG sites, and risperidone associated CpG sites, except for the post-treatment FES associated CpG sites. There were 590 DNA methylation cites normalized by risperidone treatment. The methylation changes of these 590 CpG sites were related to alterations in symptom severity, spontaneous neurophysiological activity, and cognitive function. To our knowledge, this is the first longitudinal methylation study of drug treatment effect and side effect in psychiatric disorders to include parallel studies of neuroimaging and cognitive phenotypes. We identified FES-associated CpG sites not confounded by drug treatment as potential SCZ biomarkers. The normalization effect of risperidone monotherapy suggests that DNA methylation changes may serve as a predictive biomarker for treatment effect. The constructed methylation-phenotype network revealed a relationship between methylation and a wide range of biological and psychological variables.",

    "abstract": "High density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays allow large numbers of individuals to be rapidly and cost-effectively genotyped at large numbers of genetic markers. However, despite being widely used in studies of humans and domesticated plants and animals, SNP arrays are lacking for most wild organisms. We developed a custom 90K Affymetrix Axiom array for an intensively studied pinniped, the Antarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus gazella). SNPs were discovered from a combination of genomic and transcriptomic resources and filtered according to strict criteria. Out of a total of 85,359 SNPs tiled on the array, 75,601 (88.6%) successfully converted and were polymorphic in 274 animals from a breeding colony at Bird Island in South Georgia. Evidence was found for inbreeding, with three genomic inbreeding coefficients being strongly intercorrelated and the proportion of the genome in ROH being non-zero in all individuals. Furthermore, analysis of genomic relatedness coefficients identified multiple second and third order relatives among a sample of ostensibly unrelated individuals. Such \"cryptic relatedness\" within fur seal breeding colonies may increase the likelihood of consanguinous matings and could therefore have implications for understanding fitness variation and mate choice. Finally, we demonstrate the cross-amplification potential of the array in three related species. Overall, our SNP array will facilitate future studies of Antarctic fur seals and has the potential to serve as a more general resource for the wider pinniped research community.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the absence of verbal communication it is challenging to infer an individuals sensory and emotional experience. In adults, fMRI has been used to develop multivariate brain activity signatures, which reliably capture elements of human pain experience. We translate whole-brain fMRI signatures that encode pain perception in adults to the newborn infant brain, to advance understanding of functional brain development and pain perception in early life.\n\nMethodsA cohort of adults (n=10; mean age=28.3 years) and 2 cohorts of healthy infants (Cohort A: n=15; Cohort B: n=22; mean postnatal age=3 days) were stimulated with low intensity nociceptive stimuli (64-512mN) during acquisition of functional MRI data. fMRI pain signatures were applied directly to the adult data and transformed such that they could be applied to the infant brain. In each cohort, we assessed the concordance of the signatures with the brain responses using cosine-similarity scores, and we assessed stimulus intensity encoding of the signature responses using Spearman rank correlation. Brain activity in  pro-pain and  anti-pain brain regions were also examined.\n\nFindingsThe Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS), which reflects aspects of nociceptive pain experience, was activated in both the adults and infants, and reliably encoded stimulus intensity. However, the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature (SIIPS1), which reflects higher-level cognitive modulation of nociceptive input, was only expressed in adults.  Pro-pain brain regions showed similar activation patterns in adults and infants, whereas,  anti-pain brain regions exhibited divergent responses.\n\nInterpretationBasic intensity encoding of nociceptive information is similar in adults and infants. However, translation of adult brain signatures into infants reveals significant differences in infant cerebral processing of nociceptive information, which may reflect their lack of expectation, motivation and contextualisation. This study expands the use of brain activity pain signatures to non-verbal patients and provides a potential approach to assess analgesic interventions in infancy.\n\nFundingThis work was funded by Wellcome (Senior Research Fellowship awarded to Prof. Rebeccah Slater) and SSNAP \"Support for Sick and Newborn Infants and their Parents\" Medical Research Fund (University of Oxford Excellence Fellowship awarded to Dr Eugene Duff).\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed for research articles published prior to March 2020 using terms including  fMRI,  infant or neonate, and  pain or nociception in the title or abstract. Due to the relatively new emergence of this field, and the experimental and analytical challenges involved in studying cerebral processing of pain in the MRI environment in healthy newborn infants, only five fMRI studies have examined infant brain responses to nociceptive input.\n\nIn a foundational pilot study, Williams et al., applied an experimental noxious stimulus to a single infant, evoking widespread brain activity that included several brain regions involved in pain processing in adults. Goksan et al., subsequently performed an observational cohort study and used regional analyses to compare active brain regions in infants (n=10) and adults (n=10), concluding that the evoked patterns of brain activity were broadly similar in infants and adults. Further follow-up analysis in the infant cohort revealed that the functional connectivity of brain regions involved in descending pain modulation influences the magnitude of pain-related brain activity. Two further studies focused on methodological advances, providing evidence-based recommendations for fMRI acquisition parameters and image processing in order to maximise the quality of infant data, and these methods have been implemented in this study.\n\nAdded value of this studyThis study translates validated adult pain fMRI brain signatures to a nonverbal patient population in which the assessment and management of pain presents a significant clinical challenge. Application of fMRI brain signatures to newborn infants expands on previous fMRI studies that provided only qualitative evidence that noxious stimulation commonly activates brain regions in the adult and infant brain. Here we demonstrate that the basic encoding of the sensory discriminative aspects of pain, as represented by the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS), occurs in both adults and infants, whereas higher-level cognitive modulation of pain, represented by the Stimulus Intensity Independent Pain Signature (SIIPS1) is only present in adults and not observed in infants. The differences in how the immature infant brain processes pain, relative to the mature adult brain, are likely to reflect differences in their expectation, motivation and contextualisation of external events rather than differences in their core nociceptive cerebral processing of pain. This work allows us to use quantitative fMRI observations to make stronger inferences related to pain experience in nonverbal infants.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceBehavioural pain scores used in neonatal clinical care offer limited sensitivity and specificity to pain. Neonatal clinical trials that use these scores as outcome measures frequently report a lack of efficacy of common analgesic interventions, resulting in few evidence-based drugs for treating pain. The value of using brain-based neuroimaging markers of pain as a means of providing objective evidence of analgesic efficacy in early proof of concept studies is well recognised in adults, even in the absence of behavioural pain modulation. Similarly, in infants EEG-based measures of noxious-evoked brain activity have been used as outcome measures in clinical trials of analgesics to overcome some of the inherent limitations of using behavioural observations to quantify analgesic efficacy. Considering the successful translation of the Neurologic Pain Signature (NPS) and its sensitivity to analgesic modulation in adults, this novel methodology represents an objective brain-based fMRI approach that could be used to advance the discovery and assessment of analgesic interventions in infancy.",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic scaling in neurons has been attributed to the individual contribution of either translation or degradation; however there remains limited insight towards understanding how the interplay between the two processes effectuates synaptic homeostasis. Here, we report that a co-dependence between protein synthesis and degradation mechanisms drives synaptic homeostasis whereas abrogation of either prevents it. Coordination between the two processes is achieved through the formation of a tripartite complex between translation regulators, the 26S proteasome and the miRNA-induced-silencing-complex (miRISC) components such as Argonaute, MOV10 and Trim32 on actively translating transcripts or polysomes. The components of this ternary complex directly interact with each other in an RNA-dependent manner. Disruption of polysomes abolishes this ternary interaction, suggesting that translating RNAs facilitate the combinatorial action of the proteasome and the translational apparatus. We identify that synaptic downscaling involves miRISC remodeling which entails the mTORC1-dependent translation of Trim32, an E3 ligase and the subsequent degradation of its target, MOV10 via the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase. We find that the E3 ligase Trim32 specifically polyubiquitinates MOV10 for its degradation during synaptic downscaling. MOV10 degradation alone is sufficient to invoke downscaling by enhancing Arc translation through its 3 UTR and causing the subsequent removal of post-synaptic AMPA receptors. Synaptic scaling was occluded when we depleted Trim32 and overexpressed MOV10 in neurons, suggesting that the Trim32-MOV10 axis is necessary for synaptic downscaling. We propose a mechanism that exploits a translation-driven protein degradation paradigm to invoke miRISC remodeling and induce homeostatic scaling during chronic network activity.",

While ventral pallidal (VP) activity encodes reward value, the specific roles of VP subpopulations in computation and expression of this value are poorly understood. Here, we establish that inhibitory input from the VP is crucial for reward-related inhibition of NAc firing. A sparse, non-canonical subpopulation of VP neurons, the so-called \"ventral arkypallidal (vArky)\" neurons makes inhibitory synaptic contacts throughout the NAcSh, and drives inhibition of NAcSh neurons in vivo. Moreover, endogenous calcium activity of vArky neurons predicted subsequent reward consumption behavior, while optogenetically activating this pathway increased reward consumption by amplifying hedonic value of reward. Classically, the VP is considered downstream of the NAc; however, our results challenge this view and establish that vArky neurons in the VP promote reward consumption via potent modulation of NAcSh firing.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are more prevalent in females than males, and frequently emerge during adolescence. Despite this, preclinical research commonly focuses on adult males. Here we use Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction in adolescent male and female rats to understand sex- and age-dependent processes relevant to anxiety disorders. In experiment 1, 35-day-old male and female rats were exposed to 6 pairings of a conditioned stimulus (CS, a tone) with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US, a footshock). The next day they were extinguished in a contextually distinct chamber, via 60 presentations of the CS without the US. Extinction recall was tested 24 hours later in the extinction context. Estrous phase was monitored by cytology on vaginal smears taken 1 hour after each behavioral session. In experiment 2, male and female rats were given sham surgery or gonadectomy at 21 days of age. They were then trained and tested as for experiment 1. We observed that females in proestrus or met/diestrus during extinction showed delayed extinction and impaired extinction recall the next day compared to males. Ovariectomy enhanced extinction for female rats, but orchidectomy delayed extinction for males. Plasma analyses showed that met/di/proestrus phases were associated with high estradiol levels. These findings suggest that high plasma estradiol levels impair extinction for adolescent females. While these results contradict what is observed in adult animals, they are consistent with the prevalence of anxiety disorders observed in females. Our findings have important implications for understanding and treating anxiety in adolescents, particularly where treatment involves extinction-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "Microbial attachment to surfaces is ubiquitous in nature. Most species of bacteria attach and adhere to surfaces via special appendages such as pili and fimbriae, the roles of which have been extensively studied. Here we report an experiment on pilus-less mutants of Caulobacter crescentus weakly attached to a plastic surface and subjected to an electric field parallel to the surface. We find that some individual cells transiently but repeatedly adhere to the surface in a stick-slip fashion in the presence of an electric field. Even while transiently detached, these bacteria move significantly slower than the unattached ones in the same field of view undergoing electrophoretic motion. We refer this behavior of repeated and transient attachment as \"quasi-attachment\". The speed of the quasi-attached bacteria exhibits large variations, frequently dropping close to zero for short intervals of time. This study suggests applying electric field as a useful method to investigate bacteria-surface interaction, which is significant in broader contexts such as infection and environmental control.\n\nSignificanceInteraction between bacteria and surfaces occur widely in nature, including those in industrial, environmental, and medical settings. It is therefore important to understand various mechanisms and factors that affect numerous forms of bacterium-surface interaction, particularly those resulting in adhesion or attachment, be they strong or weak, permanent or transient. This work takes a unique approach to identify a transient and reversible mode of bacterial attachment to a solid surface, by applying an electric field to exert a force for detachment. The force thus exerted proves to reach the amplitude required to detach bacteria of a pilus-less strain that weakly attach to a plastic surface. The method may be applied broadly to investigate bacteria-surface interaction.",

    "abstract": "Kinases are highly tractable drug targets that have reached unparalleled success in fields such as cancer but whose potential has not yet been realized in neuroscience. There are currently 55 approved small molecule kinase-targeting drugs, 48 of which have an anti-cancer indication. The intrinsic complexity linked to central nervous system (CNS) drug development and a lack of validated targets has hindered progress in developing kinase inhibitors for CNS disorders when compared to other therapeutic areas such as oncology. Identification and/or characterization of new kinases as potential drug targets for neurodegenerative diseases will create opportunities for development of CNS drugs in the future. The track record of kinase inhibitors in other disease indications supports the idea that with the best targets identified small molecule kinase modulators will become impactful therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nKEY CONCEPTSChemical probe: a high-quality small molecule that is potent, selective, and cell-active that meets the following criteria: (1) in vitro biochemical IC50 < 50 nM, (2) [&ge;] 30-fold selectivity relative to other kinases in a large assay panel such as DiscoverX scanMAX, and (3) cellular activity or target engagement with an IC50 < 1 M\n\nNarrow spectrum: a selectivity threshold that can be defined as potently inhibiting [~]10% or less of all kinases screened\n\nKinome: all human kinases\n\nKinase chemogenomic set (KCGS): publicly-available curated physical library of narrow spectrum and potent kinase inhibitors for which the SGC-UNC has received permission to share the compounds; subsequent releases will increase kinome-wide coverage\n\nIlluminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) program: several interconnected projects currently funded by the National Institutes of Health to provide information on historically understudied members within protein families that have provided drug targets; the three main focus areas are kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, and ion channels\n\nIDG kinase: a kinase that was nominated as dark (understudied) by the National Institutes of Health IDG program (curated list found here: https://druggablegenome.net/IDGProteinList); IDG consortium members generate data and resources to aid in the illumination of the function of these kinases\n\nDK tool: a narrow spectrum inhibitor that exhibits a defined selectivity score (S10(1 M) < 0.05) and cellular target engagement with an IC50 < 1 M; S10(1 M) is a measure of selectivity equal to the percentage of screened kinases biochemically inhibited by >90% at 1 M",

    "abstract": "The neocortex is disproportionately expanded in human compared to mouse, both in its total volume relative to subcortical structures and in the proportion occupied by supragranular layers that selectively make connections within the cortex and other telencephalic structures. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of human and mouse cortex show an increased diversity of glutamatergic neuron types in supragranular cortex in human and pronounced gradients as a function of cortical depth. To probe the functional and anatomical correlates of this transcriptomic diversity, we describe a robust Patch-seq platform using neurosurgically-resected human tissues. We characterize the morphological and physiological properties of five transcriptomically defined human glutamatergic supragranular neuron types. Three of these types have properties that are specialized compared to the more homogeneous properties of transcriptomically defined homologous mouse neuron types. The two remaining supragranular neuron types, located exclusively in deep layer 3, do not have clear mouse homologues in supragranular cortex but are transcriptionally most similar to deep layer mouse intratelencephalic-projecting neuron types. Furthermore, we reveal the transcriptomic types in deep layer 3 that express high levels of non-phosphorylated heavy chain neurofilament protein that label long-range neurons known to be selectively depleted in Alzheimers disease. Together, these results demonstrate the power of transcriptomic cell type classification, provide a mechanistic underpinning for increased complexity of cortical function in human cortical evolution, and implicate discrete transcriptomic cell types as selectively vulnerable in disease.",

    "abstract": "The morphology of the mammalian brain cortex is highly folded. For long it has been known that specific patterns of folding are necessary for an optimally functioning brain. On the extremes, lissencephaly, a lack of folds in humans, and polymicrogyria, an overly folded brain, can lead to severe mental retardation, short life expectancy, epileptic seizures, and tetraplegia. The construction of a quantitative model on how and why these folds appear during the development of the brain is the first step in understanding the cause of these conditions. In recent years, there have been various attempts to understand and model the mechanisms of brain folding. Previous works have shown that mechanical instabilities play a crucial role in the formation of brain folds, and that the geometry of the fetal brain is one of the main factors in dictating the folding characteristics. However, modeling higher-order folding, one of the main characteristics of the highly gyrencephalic brain, has not been fully tackled. The effects of thickness inhomogeneity in the gyrogenesis of the mammalian brain are studied in silico. Finite-element simulations of rectangular slabs are performed. The slabs are divided into two distinct regions, where the outer layer mimics the gray matter, and the inner layer the underlying white matter. Differential growth is introduced by growing the top layer tangentially, while keeping the underlying layer untouched. The brain tissue is modeled as a neo-Hookean hyperelastic material. Simulations are performed with both, homogeneous and inhomogeneous cortical thickness. The homogeneous cortex is shown to fold into a single wavelength, as is common for bilayered materials, while the inhomogeneous cortex folds into more complex conformations. In the early stages of development of the inhomogeneous cortex, structures reminiscent of the deep sulci in the brain are obtained. As the cortex continues to develop, secondary undulations, which are shallower and more variable than the structures obtained in earlier gyrification stage emerge, reproducing well-known characteristics of higher-order folding in the mammalian, and particularly the human, brain.",

Twenty of the 45 monitored Danish orchids showed a significant decrease in abundance over the past 30 years (16, if only orchids with at least 50 observations each were selected), thus corroborating the previous observations of declining orchid abundances at European scale. Generally, there was a significant negative effect of overgrowing with tall-growing herbs and shrubs on the abundance of Danish orchids mainly caused by change of farming practises, as extensive management, such as grazing or mowing of light-open grassland areas, has decreased.",

However, previous anatomical and behavioural findings are contradictory, and the diagnostic validity of the line bisection task has been challenged. We hereby aimed to re-analyse the anatomical basis of pathological line bisection by using multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and disconnection-symptom mapping based on support vector regression in a sample of 163 right hemispheric acute stroke patients. In line with some previous studies, we observed that pathological line bisection was related to more than a single focal lesion location. Cortical damage primarily to right parietal areas, particularly the inferior parietal lobe, including the angular gyrus, as well as damage to the right basal ganglia contributed to the pathology. In contrast to some previous studies, an involvement of frontal cortical brain areas in the line bisection task was not observed. Subcortically, damage to the right superior longitudinal fasciculus (I, II and III) and arcuate fasciculus as well as the internal capsule was associated with line bisection errors. Moreover, white matter damage of interhemispheric fibre bundles, such as the anterior commissure and posterior parts of the corpus callosum projecting into the left hemisphere, was predictive of pathological deviation in the line bisection task.",

In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis on the codon usage bias (CUB) of 13 SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different geo-locations (countries) in an attempt to characterize it, unravel the main force shaping its pattern, and understand its adaptation to Homo sapiens. Overall results revealed that, SARS-CoV-2 codon usage is slightly biased similarly to other RNA viruses. Nucleotide and dinucleotide compositions displayed a bias toward A/U content in all codon positions and CpU-ended codons preference, respectively. Eight common putative preferred codons were identified, and all of them were A/U-ended (U-ended: 7, A-ended: 1). In addition, natural selection was found to be the main force structuring the codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2. However, mutation pressure and other factors such as compositional constraints and hydrophobicity had an undeniable contribution. Two adaptation indices were utilized and indicated that SARS-CoV-2 is moderately adapted to Homo sapiens compared to other human viruses. The outcome of this study may help in understanding the underlying factors involved in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and may aid in vaccine design strategies.",

    "abstract": "Electropalatography is a technique that employs a custom-made artificial palate to measure the contact established between the tongue and the hard palate. This technique is widely used in treatment of articulation disorders and studies of speech. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the electropalate, the device needs to be separated from the volume that usually contains electropalate worn on hard palate. This is done with the use of segmentation techniques. Prior to the segmentation, the registration of the two volumes, one containing the electroplate worn on hard palate, and one containing only hard palate, needs to be done. The registration is a technique of aligning multiple images by geometrical transform. Over the years, many methods for registration have been developed. The following paper describes the method of registration based on sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is a technique that evaluates the change in the number of pixels with different intensity with a shift of the volumes in different dimensions. Then based on the found optimal shift value, the shift in different dimension of the matrix is made. The technique successfully improves the alignments between two data sets, reducing the number of non-matching pixels. The sensitivity analysis-based registration should be useful in the future improvement of image processing tools that are crucial for the medical imaging.",

    "abstract": "Mechanistic studies of pancreatic disease progression using animal models require objective and quantifiable assessment of tissue changes among animal cohorts. Disease state quantification, however, relies heavily on tissue immunostaining, which can be expensive, labor- and time-intensive, and all too often produces uneven staining that is prone to variable interpretation between experts and inaccurate quantification. Here we develop a fully automated semantic segmentation tool using deep learning for the rapid and objective quantification of histologic features using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained pancreatic tissue sections acquired from murine pancreatic cancer models. The tool was successfully trained to segment and quantify multiple histopathologic features of pancreatic pre-cancer evolution, including normal acinar structures, the ductal phenotype of acinar-to ductal metaplasia (ADM), dysplasia, and the expanding stromal compartment. Disease quantifications produced by our computational tool were highly correlated to the results obtained by immunostaining markers of normal and diseased tissue (DAPI, amylase, and cytokeratins; correlation score= 0.9, 0.95, and 0.91, respectively) and were able to accurately reproduce immunostain patterns. Moreover, our tool was able to distinguish ADM from dysplasia, which are not reliably distinguished by immunostaining, and avoid the pitfalls of uneven or poor-quality staining. Using this tool, we quantified the changes in histologic feature abundance for murine cohorts with oncogenic Kras-driven disease at 2 months and 5 months of age (n=12, n=13). The calculated changes in histologic feature abundance were consistent with biological expectations, showing an expansion of the stromal compartment, a reduction of normal acinar tissue, and an increase in both ADM and dysplasia as disease progresses (p= 2e-6, 6e-7, 4e-4, and 3e-5, respectively). These results demonstrate the tools efficacy for accurate and rapid quantification of multiple histologic features using an objective and automated platform. Our tool promises to rapidly accelerate and improve the quantification of altered pancreatic disease progression in animal studies.",

We develop the adapted for living therapeutics compartmental absorption and transit (ALT-CAT) model to provide metrics for drug efficacy across nine age groups of PKU patients and evaluate model parameters that are influenced by patient physiology, microbe selection and therapeutic production, and dosing formulations.\n\nImportanceThis work describes a kinetic model to study the behavior of orally delivered living therapeutics. Such therapeutics are becoming increasingly relevant and are an exciting mode of drug delivery that stems from the growing interest through the convergence of advances in synthetic biology of probiotics and gut microbes as well as microbiome science. In particular, this work describes the development of a mathematical framework (pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic, PK-PD) called ALT-CAT to model the behavior of orally delivered engineered bacteria that act as living therapeutics by adapting similar methods that have been developed and widely-used for small molecular drug delivery and absorption.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a powerful protein degradation pathway with limited specificity. Our recent study proposed and demonstrated a potential strategy to harness autophagy to selectively degrade a specific pathogenic protein using autophagosome tethering compounds (ATTEC). ATTEC interact with both the target protein and the autophagosome protein LC3, and thus tether the target protein to the autophagosomes for subsequent degradation. The concentration-dependent curve of the target protein is U-shaped, but there has been lack of both kinetic and steady-state modeling of the degradation effects of ATTEC. Here we established a simplified model describing the kinetics and steady-state level of target protein, and characterized how compounds properties, especially binding affinities to LC3 and to the target protein, may influence their degradation effects.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells acquire resistance to cytotoxic therapies targeting major survival pathways by adapting their metabolism. The AKT pathway is a major regulator of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma progression. The mechanisms of adaptation to long-term silencing of AKT isoforms of pancreatic cancer cells were studied. Following silencing, cancer cells remained quiescent for long periods of time, after which they recovered proliferative capacities. Adaptation caused profound proteomic changes largely affecting mitochondrial biogenesis, energy metabolism, and acquisition of a number of distinct cancer stem cell (CSC) characteristics depending on the AKT isoform that was silenced. The adaptation to AKT1 silencing drove most de-differentiation and acquisition of stemness through C-MYC down-modulation and NANOG up-regulation, which were required for survival of adapted CSCs. The changes associated to adaptation sensitized cancer cells to inhibitors targeting regulators of oxidative respiration and mitochondrial biogenesis. In vivo pharmacological co-inhibition of AKT and mitochondrial metabolism effectively controlled pancreatic adenocarcinoma growth in pre-clinical models.",

    "abstract": "The functions of protein kinases have been widely studied and over 60 kinase inhibitors are FDA-approved drugs. Membership in the human kinome is nonetheless subject to multiple overlapping and inconsistent definitions and is unevenly studied, complicating functional genomics and chemical genetics. We describe objective criteria for refining the definition of the human kinome to comprise an extended set of 710 kinase domains and a more narrowly curated set of 557 protein kinase like (PKL) domains. An online tool (www.kinome.org) makes it possible to sort these sets on multiple structural and functional criteria. Focusing on the least studied one-third of the kinome we find that many proteins are differentially expressed, essential in multiple cell lines, and mutated in the Cancer Genome Atlas. We show that some understudied kinases are high affinity off-targets of clinical-grade compounds and approved drugs and we describe an optimized small molecule library making use of this information for selective kinome perturbation. We conclude that the understudied kinome contains physiologically important proteins, including possible targets for future drug discovery campaigns.",

Thus, the taiep rat is a suitable model to study neuroimmune alterations. The aim of this study was to investigate the immune alterations present in the mutant taiep rat during the acute infection with Trichinella spiralis. Our results show that there is an important decrease in the number of intestinal larvae in the taiep rat when compared to the Sprague-Dawley control rats. We also found differences in the percentage of innate and adaptive immune cell profile in the mesenteric lymphatic nodes and the spleen associated to the lack of myelin in the taiep rat. Finally, a clear pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern was seen in the infected taiep rat, which may explain the decrease in larvae number. These results sustain the theory that neuroimmune interaction is a fundamental process capable of modulating the immune response, particularly against the parasite Trichinella spiralis in a model of progressive demyelination that could be an important mechanism in autoimmune diseases and parasite infection.\n\nAuthor summaryThe complex communication among the brain and the immune system may be certainly altered during an infection and may be determinant in the resolution of this. We analyze the immune response to a parasite in a rat model in which a demyelinization process occur naturally and found that parasite loads were reduced when comparing with control subjects and this was accompanied to changes in the systemic immune response.",

They possess the property of reducing the tension of the membrane interfaces. No studies have been conducted on Shigella species showing their involvement of biosurfactant like molecules (BLM) in pathogenicity. This study aims to show that environmental and clinical strains of Shigella are able to produce BLM by emulsifying gasoline and diesel fuels. Our study has shown that BLM are secreted in the extracellular medium with EI24 ranging from 80 to 100%. The secretion is depending on the type III secretion system (T3SS). We did show that S. flexneri, S. boydii and S. sonnei are able to interact with hydrophobic areas with respectively 17.64%, 21.42% and 22.22% of hydrophobicity. 100 mM Benzoic and 1.5mg/mL Salycilic acids have been inhibited T3SS and this totally stops the BLM secretion. Pseudomonas aeruginosa which has T3SS is able to produce 100% of BLM in the presence or in the absence of both T3SS inhibitors. The secreted BLM is extractable with an organic solvent such as chloroform and could entirely be considered like lipopeptide or polypeptidic compound. By secreting BLM, Shigella is able to perform multicellular phenomena like \"swarming\" allowing to invade and disseminate inside epithelial cells.",

We estimated the perspective of the students through anonymous survey; we used students exam grades to estimate their ecology learning, and their effort and performance in the active learning tasks through their grades and proportion of intermediate steps for each active learning task. Active learning involved teachers stimuli for students active involvement, extra-class group task, individual online writing assessments, redoing exam in pairs, and classroom writing group assessments. We also evaluated the impact, unto the effectiveness of active learning, of several student characteristics, such as sex, age, individual study effort, and previous basic knowledge. We found that self-evaluated learning increased linearly with teachers attempts to stimulate students active involvement (P = 0.0003), extra-class group task (P = 0.0003), and previous basic knowledge (P = 0.02), while students grades increased asymptotically with extra-class group task (P < 2-16), and increased linearly with online writing assessments (P = 9.3-8) and classroom-based writing group assessments (P = 0.03). Our results showed that students perceive most part of the effectiveness of active-learning tasks and of teachers efforts. We showed that active learning tasks are complementary, so we recommend that teachers in both college and high school should implement simultaneous active-learning tasks, that include extra-class work in group, individual and group writing assessments, and should stimulate students engagement through respectful and non-authoritarian behavior of the teacher. Our results also showed that previous basic knowledge also plays a central role in driving effective learning, evidencing the importance of students instruction outside college. The applied teaching methodology is cheap and feasible for large classes. In these times of rising intolerance, prejudice, dismiss of environmental issues and disregard of science itself, we need an effective, pluralistic, respectful, and student-centred education, that fosters critical thinking, tolerance and respect for differing points of view.",

These methods probe the tissue using light in the red to near-infrared region that shows relatively high penetration in biological tissues.

In the present work, a method for identifying different types of tumors in human brain, breast and uterus based on their absorption and scattering characteristics in the red to near-infrared spectra is proposed. The classification method depends on studying the red to near-infrared light diffusion through the examined tissues using Monte-Carlo simulation and finite element solution of the light diffusion equation. The obtained tissue reflectance profiles, optical fluence rate distribution and absorbed faction in each tumor type show different characteristics along the selected wavelengths. The variation in these three features can be considered as an alternative approach of medical diagnosis or can assist with other conventional diagnosis methods.",

    "abstract": "The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) signaling pathway is the primary means by which the heart regulates moment-to-moment changes in contractility and metabolism. We have previously found that PKA signaling is dysfunctional in the diabetic heart, yet the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. The objective of this study was to determine if decreased insulin signaling contributes to a dysfunctional PKA response. To do so, we isolated adult cardiomyocytes (ACMs) from wild type and Akita type 1 diabetic mice. ACMs were cultured in the presence or absence of insulin and PKA signaling was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody that recognizes proteins specifically phosphorylated by PKA. We found significant decreases in proteins phosphorylated by PKA in wild type ACMs cultured in the absence of insulin. Akita ACMs also had decreased PKA signaling in the absence of insulin and this was not rescued by insulin. The decrease in PKA signaling was observed regardless of whether the kinase was stimulated with a beta-agonist, a cell-permeable cAMP analog, or with phosphodiesterase inhibitors. PKA content was unaffected, suggesting that the decrease in PKA signaling may be occurring by the loss of specific PKA substrates. Phospho-specific antibodies were therefore used to discern which potential substrates may be sensitive to the loss of insulin. Contractile proteins were phosphorylated similarly in wild type and Akita ACMs regardless of insulin. However, phosphorylation of the glycolytic regulator, PFK-2, was significantly decreased in an insulin-dependent manner in wild type ACMs and in an insulin-independent manner in Akita ACMs. These results demonstrate a defect in PKA activation in the diabetic heart, mediated in part by deficient insulin signaling, that results in an abnormal activation of a primary metabolic regulator.",

    "abstract": "Early warning signals (EWS) identify systems approaching a critical transition, where the system undergoes a sudden change in state. For example, monitoring changes in variance or autocorrelation offers a computationally inexpensive method which can be used in real-time to assess when an infectious disease transitions to elimination. EWS have a promising potential to not only be used to monitor infectious diseases, but also to inform control policies to aid disease elimination. Previously, potential EWS have been identified for prevalence data, however the prevalence of a disease is often not known directly. In this work we identify EWS for incidence data, the standard data type collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or World Health Organization (WHO). We show, through several examples, that EWS calculated on simulated incidence time series data exhibit vastly different behaviours to those previously studied on prevalence data. In particular, the variance displays a decreasing trend on the approach to disease elimination, contrary to that expected from critical slowing down theory; this could lead to unreliable indicators of elimination when calculated on real-world data. We derive analytical predictions which can be generalised for many epidemiological systems, and we support our theory with simulated studies of disease incidence. Additionally, we explore EWS calculated on the rate of incidence over time, a property which can be extracted directly from incidence data. We find that although incidence might not exhibit typical critical slowing down properties before a critical transition, the rate of incidence does, presenting a promising new data type for the application of statistical indicators.\n\nAuthor summaryThe threat posed by infectious diseases has a huge impact on our global society. It is therefore critical to monitor infectious diseases as new data become available during control campaigns. One obstacle in observing disease emergence or elimination is understanding what influences noise in the data and how this fluctuates when near to zero cases. The standard data type collected is the number of new cases per day/month/year but mathematical modellers often focus on data such as the total number of infectious people, due to its analytical properties. We have developed a methodology to monitor the standard type of data to inform whether a disease is approaching emergence or disease elimination. We have shown computationally how fluctuations change as disease data get closer towards a tipping point and our insights highlight how these observed changes can be strikingly different when calculated on different types of data.",

    "abstract": "Secretory renin promotes hypertrophy, apoptosis, necrosis and fibrosis through angiotensin generation. It has been claimed that local expression of renin contributes to the deleterious effects of the renin-angiotensin system in the heart. Besides the classic renin transcript (renin-a), encoding for secretory renin, a putative brain-specific (renin-b) and a putative lung-specific (renin-c) transcript may exist in human. In contrast to secretory renin, renin-b cannot be secreted, remains within the cytosol and is imported into mitochondria. In contradiction to renin-a, renin-b exerts cardioprotective effects in hearts and in cardiac cells of the rat under ischemia related conditions. To date, available data on cardiac renin expression remain inconsistent. Nobody has yet investigated which renin transcripts are expressed in the human heart. We systematically analyzed the levels of renin transcripts using specific and sensitive nested reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) in human ventricular biopsies obtained from patients with heart diseases. In the 33 biopsies available, neither the expression of classic renin-a, nor of the alternative renin-c was detected. In contrast, the renin-b transcript, which was previously classified as brain-specific, was found in 11/33 ventricular biopsies. Our data exclude the expression of secretory renin and indicate that local expression of cytosolic renin but not of secretory renin can play a functional role in the human heart.",

    "abstract": "The requirements for oocyte meiotic cytokinesis during polar body extrusion are not well understood. In particular, the relationship between the oocyte meiotic spindle and polar body contractile ring dynamics remains largely unknown. We have used live cell imaging and spindle assembly defective mutants lacking the function of CLASP/CLS-2, kinesin-12/KLP-18, or katanin/MEI-1 to investigate the relationship between meiotic spindle structure and polar body extrusion in C. elegans oocytes. We show that spindle bipolarity and chromosome segregation are not required for polar body contractile ring formation and chromosome extrusion in klp-18 mutants, but oocytes with severe spindle assembly defects due to loss of CLS-2 or MEI-1 have penetrant and distinct polar body extrusion defects: CLS-2 is required early for contractile ring assembly or stability, while MEI-1 is required later for contractile ring constriction. We also show that CLS-2 negatively regulates membrane ingression throughout the oocyte cortex during meiosis I, and we explore the relationship between global cortical dynamics and oocyte meiotic cytokinesis.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe precursor cells that produce gametes--sperm and eggs in animals--have two copies of each chromosome, one from each parent. These precursors undergo specialized cell divisions that leave each gamete with only one copy of each chromosome; defects that produce incorrect chromosome number cause severe developmental abnormalities. In oocytes, these cell divisions are highly asymmetric, with extra chromosomes discarded into small membrane bound polar bodies, leaving one chromosome set within the much larger oocyte. How oocytes assemble the contractile apparatus that pinches off polar bodies remains poorly understood. To better understand this process, we have used the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to investigate the relationship between the bipolar structure that separates oocyte chromosomes, called the spindle, and assembly of the contractile apparatus that pinches off polar bodies. We used a comparative approach, examining this relationship in three spindle assembly defective mutants. Bipolar spindle assembly and chromosome separation were not required for polar body extrusion, as it occurred normally in mutants lacking a protein called KLP-18. However, mutants lacking the protein CLS-2 failed to assemble the contractile apparatus, while mutants lacking the protein MEI-1 assembled a contractile apparatus that failed to fully constrict. We also found that CLS-2 down-regulates membrane ingression throughout the oocyte surface, and we explored the relationship between oocyte membrane dynamics and polar body extrusion.",

    "abstract": "The role of adaptive divergence in the formation of new species has been the subject of much recent debate. The most direct evidence comes from traits that can be shown to have diverged under natural selection and that now contribute to reproductive isolation. Here, we make the case for differential adaptation of two fire-bellied toads (Anura, Bombinatoridae) to two types of aquatic habitat. Bombina bombina and B. variegata are two anciently diverged taxa that now reproduce in predator-rich ponds and ephemeral aquatic sites, respectively. Nevertheless, they hybridise extensively wherever their distribution ranges adjoin. We show in laboratory experiments that, as expected, B. variegata tadpoles are at relatively greater risk of predation from dragonfly larvae, even when they display a predator-induced phenotype. These tadpoles spent relatively more time swimming and so prompted more attacks from the visually hunting predators. We predict that genomic regions linked to high activity in B. variegata are barred from introgression into the B. bombina gene pool and thus contribute to gene flow barriers that keep the two taxa from merging into one.",

    "abstract": "A striking feature of advanced insect societies is the existence of workers that forgo reproduction. Two broad types of workers exist in eusocial bees: nurses which care for their young siblings and the queen, and foragers who guard the nest and forage for food. Comparisons between this two worker subcastes have been performed in honeybees, but data from other bees are scarce. To understand whether similar molecular mechanisms are involved in nurse-forager differences across distinct species, we compared gene expression and DNA methylation profiles between nurses and foragers of the buff-tailed bumblebee Bombus terrestris and of the stingless bee Tetragonisca angustula. These datasets were then discussed comparatively to previous findings on honeybees. Our analyses revealed that although the expression pattern of genes is often species-specific, many of the biological processes and molecular pathways involved are common. Moreover, DNA methylation and gene expression correlation were dependent on the nucleotide context.",

    "abstract": "The cricetine rodent Peromyscus leucopus is an important reservoir for several human zoonoses, including Lyme disease, in North America. Akin to hamsters, the white-footed deermouse has been unevenly characterized in comparison to the murid Mus musculus. To further understanding of P. leucopus total genomic content, we investigated gut microbiomes of an outbred colony of P. leucopus, inbred M. musculus, and a natural population of P. leucopus. Metagenome and whole genome sequencing were combined with microbiology and microscopy approaches. A focus was the genus Lactobacillus, four diverse species of which were isolated from forestomach and feces of colony P. leucopus. Three of the species--L. animalis, L. reuteri, and provisionally-named species \"L. peromysci\"--were identified in fecal metagenomes of wild P. leucopus but not discernibly in samples from M. musculus. L. johnsonii, the fourth species, was common in M. musculus but absent or sparse in wild P. leucopus. Also identified in both colony and natural populations were a Helicobacter sp. in feces but not stomach, and a Tritrichomonas sp. protozoan in cecum or feces. The gut metagenomes of colony P. leucopus were similar to those of colony M. musculus at the family or higher level and for major subsystems. But there were multiple differences between species and sexes within each species in their gut metagenomes at orthologous gene level. These findings provide a foundation for hypothesis-testing of functions of individual microbial species and for interventions, such as bait vaccines based on an autochthonous bacterium and targeting P. leucopus for transmission-blocking.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms regulate the redox state of different biomolecules to precisely control biological processes. These processes can be modulated by electrochemically coupling intracellular biomolecules to an external electrode, but current approaches afford only limited control and specificity. Here we describe specific electrochemical control of the reduction of intracellular biomolecules in Escherichia coli through introduction of a heterologous electron transfer pathway. E. coli expressing mtrCAB from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 consumed electrons directly from a cathode when fumarate or nitrate, both intracellular electron acceptors, were present. The fumarate-triggered current consumption occurred only when fumarate reductase was present, indicating all the electrons passed through this enzyme. Moreover, MtrCAB-expressing E. coli used current to stoichiometrically produce ammonia. Thus, our work introduces a modular genetic tool to reduce a specific intracellular redox molecule with an electrode, opening the possibility of electronically controlling biological processes such as biosynthesis and growth in any microorganism.",
