    "abstract": "Processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via the amyloidogenic pathway is associated with the etiology of Alzheimers disease. The cleavage of APP by {beta}-secretase to generate the transmembrane 99-residue C-terminal fragment (C99) and subsequent processing of C99 by {gamma}-secretase to yield amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides are essential steps in this pathway. Biochemical evidence suggests amyloidogenic processing of C99 occurs in cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched liquid ordered phase membrane raft domains. However, direct evidence that C99 preferentially associates with rafts has remained elusive. Here, we test this idea by quantifying the affinity of C99-GFP for raft domains in cell-derived giant plasma membrane vesicles. We find that C99 is essentially excluded from ordered domains in HeLa cells, SH-SY5Y cells and neurons, instead exhibiting a strong (roughly 90%) affinity for disordered domains. The strong association of C99 with disordered domains occurs independently of its cholesterol binding activity, homodimerization, or the familial Alzheimer disease Arctic mutation. Finally, we confirm previous studies suggesting that C99 is processed in the plasma membrane by -secretase, in addition to the well-known {gamma}-secretase. These findings suggest that C99 itself lacks an intrinsic affinity for raft domains, implying either that amyloidogenic processing of the protein occurs in disordered regions of the membrane, that processing involves a marginal sub-population of C99 found in rafts, or that as-yet-unidentified protein-protein interactions involving C99 in living cells drive it into rafts to promote its cleavage therein.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine controls striatal circuit function, but its transmission mechanisms are not well understood. We recently showed that dopamine secretion requires RIM, suggesting that it occurs at active zone-like sites similar to conventional synapses. Here, we establish using a systematic conditional gene knockout approach that Munc13 and Liprin-, active zone proteins for vesicle priming and release site organization, are important for dopamine secretion. Correspondingly, RIM zinc finger and C2B domains, which bind to Munc13 and Liprin-, respectively, are needed to restore dopamine release in RIM knockout mice. In contrast, and different from conventional synapses, the active zone scaffolds RIM-BP and ELKS, and the RIM domains that bind to them, are expendable. Hence, dopamine release necessitates priming and release site scaffolding by RIM, Munc13, and Liprin-, but other active zone proteins are dispensable. Our work establishes that molecularly simple but efficient release site architecture mediates fast dopamine exocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Schwann cell (SC) mitochondria are quickly emerging as an important regulator of myelin maintenance in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, the mechanisms underlying demyelination in the context of mitochondrial dysfunction in the PNS are incompletely understood. We recently showed that conditional ablation of the mitochondrial protein Prohibitin 1 (Phb1) in SCs causes a severe and fast progressing demyelinating peripheral neuropathy, but the mechanism that causes failure of myelin maintenance remained unknown. Here, we report that mTORC1 and JUN are continuously activated in the absence of Phb1, likely due to mitochondrial damage. Moreover, we demonstrate that these pathways are involved in the demyelination process, and that inhibition of mTORC1 using rapamycin partially rescues the demyelinating pathology. Therefore, we propose that mTORC1 and JUN may play a critical role as executioners of demyelination in the context of perturbations to SC mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Pathogen attachment to host tissue is critical in the progress of many infections. Bacteria use adhesion in vivo to promote colonization and regulate the deployment of contact-dependent virulence traits. To specifically target host cells, they decorate themselves with adhesins, proteins that bind to mammalian cell surface receptors. One common assumption is that adhesin-receptor interactions entirely govern bacterial attachment. However, how adhesins engage with their receptors in an in vivo-like context remains unclear, in particular under the influence of a heterogeneous mechanical microenvironment. We here investigate the biophysical processes governing bacterial adhesion to host cells using a tunable adhesin-receptor system. By dynamically visualizing attachment, we found that bacterial adhesion to host cell surface, unlike adhesion to inert surfaces, involves two consecutive steps. Bacteria initially attach to their host without engaging adhesins. This step lasts about one minute during which bacteria can easily detach. We found that at this stage, the glycocalyx, a layer of glycosylated proteins and lipids, shields the host cell by keeping adhesin away from their receptor ligand. In a second step, adhesins engage with their target receptors to strengthen attachment for minutes to hours. The active properties of the membrane, endowed by the actin cytoskeleton, strengthen specific adhesion. Altogether, our results demonstrate that adhesin-ligand binding is not the sole regulator of bacterial adhesion. In fact, the host cells mechanical microenvironment relatively strongly mediated host-bacteria physical interactions, thereby playing an essential role in the onset of infection.",

    "abstract": "Noncoding RNAs (ncRNA) have emerged as important components of regulatory networks governing bacterial physiology and virulence. Previous deep-sequencing analysis identified a large diversity of ncRNAs in the human enteropathogen Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile. Some of them are trans-encoded RNAs that could require the RNA chaperone protein Hfq for their action. Recent analysis suggested a pleiotropic role of Hfq in C. difficile with the most pronounced effect on sporulation, a key process during the infectious cycle of this pathogen. However, a global view of RNAs interacting with C. difficile Hfq is missing. In the present study, we performed RNA immunoprecipitation high-throughput sequencing (RIP-Seq) to identify Hfq-associated RNAs in C. difficile. Our work revealed a large set of Hfq-interacting mRNAs and ncRNAs, including mRNA leaders and coding regions, known and potential new ncRNAs. In addition to trans-encoded RNAs, new categories of Hfq ligands were found including cis-antisense RNAs, riboswitches and CRISPR RNAs. ncRNA-mRNA and ncRNA-ncRNA pairings were postulated through computational predictions. Investigation of one of the Hfq-associated ncRNAs, RCd1, suggests that this RNA contributes to the control of late stages of sporulation in C. difficile. Altogether, these data provide essential molecular basis for further studies of post-transcriptional regulatory network in this enteropathogen.",

    "abstract": "Upon infection of Pseudomonas cells, jumbo phages 201{Phi}2-1, {Phi}PA3, and {Phi}KZ assemble a phage nucleus. Viral DNA is enclosed within the phage-encoded proteinaceous shell along with proteins associated with DNA replication, recombination and transcription. Ribosomes and proteins involved in metabolic processes are excluded from the nucleus. RNA synthesis occurs inside the phage nucleus and messenger RNA is presumably transported into the cytoplasm to be translated. Newly synthesized proteins either remain in the cytoplasm or specifically translocate into the nucleus. The molecular mechanisms governing selective protein sorting and nuclear import in these phage infection systems are currently unclear. To gain insight into this process, we studied the localization of five reporter fluorescent proteins (GFP+, sfGFP, GFPmut1, mCherry, CFP). During infection with {Phi}PA3 or 201{Phi}2-1, all five fluorescent proteins were excluded from the nucleus as expected; however, we have discovered an anomaly with the {Phi}KZ nuclear transport system. The fluorescent protein GFPmut1, expressed by itself, was transported into the {Phi}KZ phage nucleus. We identified the amino acid residues on the surface of GFPmut1 required for nuclear targeting. Fusing GFPmut1 to any protein, including proteins that normally reside in the cytoplasm, resulted in transport of the fusion into the nucleus. Although the mechanism of transport is still unknown, we demonstrate that GFPmut1 is a useful tool that can be used for fluorescent labelling and targeting of proteins into the {Phi}KZ phage nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Transmission routes impact pathogen virulence and genetics, therefore comprehensive knowledge of these routes and their contribution to pathogen circulation is essential for understanding host-pathogen interactions and designing control strategies. Deformed wing virus (DWV), a principal viral pathogen of honey bees associated with increased honey bee mortality and colony losses, became highly virulent with the spread of its vector, the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor. Reproduction of Varroa mites occurs in capped brood cells and mite-infested pupae from these cells usually have high levels of DWV. The removal of mite-infested pupae by worker bees, Varroa Sensitive Hygiene (VSH), leads to cannibalization of pupae with high DWV loads, thereby offering an alternative route for virus transmission. We used genetically tagged DWV to investigate virus transmission to and between worker bees following pupal cannibalisation under experimental conditions. We demonstrated that cannibalization of DWV-infected pupae resulted in high levels of this virus in worker bees and that the acquired virus was then transmitted between bees via trophallaxis, allowing circulation of Varroa-vectored DWV variants without the mites. Despite the known benefits of hygienic behaviour, it is possible that higher levels of VSH activity may result in increased transmission of DWV via cannibalism and trophallaxis.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the glutathione S-transferase A3-3 (GST A3-3) homodimeric enzyme was identified as the most efficient enzyme that catalyzes isomerization of the precursors of testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone in the gonads of humans and horses. However, the presence of GST A3-3 orthologs with equally high ketosteroid isomerase activity has not been verified in other mammalian species, even though pig and cattle homologs have been cloned and studied. Identifying GSTA3 genes is a challenge because of multiple GSTA gene duplications (12 in the human genome), so few genomes have a corresponding GSTA3 gene annotated. To improve our understanding of GSTA3 gene products and their functions across diverse mammalian species, we cloned homologs of the horse and human GSTA3 mRNAs from the testes of a dog, goat, and gray short-tailed opossum, with those current genomes lacking GSTA3 gene annotations. The resultant novel GSTA3 mRNA and inferred protein sequences had a high level of conservation with human GSTA3 mRNA and protein sequences ([&ge;] 70% and [&ge;] 64% identities, respectively). Sequence conservation was also apparent for the 13 residues of the \"H-site\" in the 222 amino acid GSTA3 protein that is known to interact with the steroid substrates. Modeling predicted that the dog GSTA3-3 is a more active ketosteroid isomerase than the goat or opossum enzymes. Our results help us understand the active sites of mammalian GST A3-3 enzymes, and their inhibitors may be useful for reducing steroidogenesis for medical purposes, such as fertility control or treatment of steroid-dependent diseases.",

    "abstract": "The transition from maternal to embryonic transcriptional control is a crucial step in embryogenesis. However, how alternative splicing is regulated during this process and how it contributes to early development is unknown. Using transcriptomic data from pre-implantation stages of human, mouse and cow, we show that the stage of zygotic genome activation (ZGA) exhibits the highest levels of exon skipping diversity reported for any cell or tissue type. Interestingly, much of this exon skipping is temporary, leads to disruptive non-canonical isoforms, and occurs in genes enriched for DNA damage response in the three species. We identified two core spliceosomal components, Snrpb and Snrpd2, as regulators of these patterns. These genes have low maternal expression at the time of ZGA and increase sharply thereafter. Consistently, microinjection of Snrpb/d2 mRNA into mouse zygotes reduces the levels of temporary exon skipping at ZGA, and leads to an increase in etoposide-induced DNA damage response. Altogether, our results suggest that mammalian embryos undergo an evolutionarily conserved and developmentally programmed specific splicing failure at the time of genome activation that attenuates cellular responses to DNA damage at these early stages.",

Herein, we took advantage of currently available base editors (BEs) to epitomize the isogenic disease model from hPSCs. Using this method, we established 14 hPSCs that harbor point mutations on the GNE gene, including four different mutations found in GNE myopathy patients. Due to lesser activation of p53 by BEs than Cas9, a higher editing efficiency with BEs was achieved. Four different mutations in the epimerase or kinase domains of GNE revealed mutation-specific hyposialylation, which was closely correlated to pathological clinical phenotypes. These mutation-specific hyposialylation patterns were evident in GNE protein structure modeling. Furthermore, treatment with a drug candidate currently under clinical trials showed a mutation-specific drug response in GNE myopathy disease models. These data suggest that isogenic disease models from hPSCs using BEs could serve as a useful tool for mimicking the pathophysiology of GNE myopathy and for predicting drug responses.",
