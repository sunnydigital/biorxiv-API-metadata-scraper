    "abstract": "Advanced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a rapidly emerging global health problem associated with pre-disposing genetic polymorphisms, most strikingly an isoleucine to methionine substitution in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3-I148M). Here, we study how human hepatocytes with PNPLA3 148I and 148M variants engrafted in the livers of chimeric mice respond to a hypercaloric Western-style diet. As early as 4 weeks, mice developed dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance, and steatohepatitis selectively in the human graft, followed by pericellular fibrosis after 8 weeks of hypercaloric feeding. The PNPLA3 148M variant, either from a homozygous 148M human donor or overexpressed in a homozygous 148I donor background, caused widespread microvesicular steatosis and even more severe steatohepatitis. We conclude that PNPLA3 148M in human hepatocytes exacerbates NAFLD. These models will facilitate mechanistic studies into human genetic variants associated with advanced fatty liver diseases.",

    "abstract": "In a recent report in Science Signaling (DOI: 10.1126/scisignal.aaz3140), it was suggested that low intrinsic agonism, and not biased agonism, leads to an improvement in the separation of potency in opioid-induced respiratory suppression versus antinociception. Although many of the compounds that were tested have been shown to display G protein signaling bias in prior publications, the authors conclude that since they cannot detect biased agonism in their cellular signaling studies the compounds are therefore not biased agonists. Rather, they conclude that it is low intrinsic efficacy that leads to the therapeutic window improvement. Intrinsic efficacy is the extent to which an agonist can stimulate a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) response in a system, while biased agonism takes into consideration not only intrinsic efficacy, but also potency of an agonist in an assay. Herein, we have re-analyzed the data presented in the published work (DOI: 10.1126/scisignal.aaz3140) (including the recent Erratum: DOI: 10.1126/scisignal.abf9803) to derive intrinsic efficacy and bias factors as {Delta}{Delta}log({tau}/KA) and {Delta}{Delta}log(Emax/EC50). Based on this reanalysis, the data support the conclusion that biased agonism, favoring G protein signaling, was observed. Moreover, a conservation of rank order intrinsic efficacy was not observed upon comparing responses in each assay, further suggesting that multiple active receptor states were present. These observations agree with prior studies wherein oliceridine, PZM21 and SR-17018 were first described as biased agonists with improvement in antinociception over respiratory suppression in mice. Therefore, the data in the Science Signaling manuscript does provide strong corroborating evidence that G protein signaling bias may be a means to improve opioid analgesia while avoiding certain undesirable side effects.",

    "abstract": "The endogenous opioid system of the cerebral cortex is an important feature of antinociception and reward valuation through its modulation of inhibitory neocortical interneurons. Dysregulation of this system, through disease or drugs, disrupts the reward system and contributes to eating and mood disorders, impulsive actions, and addiction. Impulsive behaviors can be induced experimentally through infusion of the  opioid receptor specific agonist [D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-Enkephalin (DAMGO) into the frontal cortex in animal models. The mechanism involves increased potassium channel function, which suppresses neocortical interneuron activity. However, much of the data on the effect of this receptor on ion channels have been derived from noncortical ORs, and the identity and effects of the ion channels that the OR targets in neocortical neurons have not been thoroughly investigated. Based on previous experiments by other labs, we hypothesized that the OR could activate -dendrotoxin (DTX) sensitive channels (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.6 subunits) to exert its inhibitory effects in cortical interneurons. This, in turn, is expected to confer a variety of effects on passive and active electrical properties of the cell. We performed patch-clamp electrophysiology to examine the electrophysiological effects of ORs in cultured neocortical interneurons. We found that a range of features among the 54 membrane and action potential properties we analyzed were modulated by ORs, including action potential kinetics and frequency. The Kv1.1, Kv1.2, and Kv1.6 inhibitor DTX reversed some effects on action potential frequency, but not effects on their kinetics. Therefore, ORs in neocortical interneurons influence DTX-sensitive channels, as well as other channels, to modulate action potential kinetics and firing properties.",

    "abstract": "Low-Intensity Focused Ultrasound Stimulation (LIFUS) holds promise for the remote modulation of neuronal activity, but an incomplete mechanistic characterization hinders its clinical maturation. Here, we developed a computational framework to model intramembrane cavitation in multi-compartmental, morphologically-realistic neuronal representations, and used it to investigate ultrasound neuromodulation of peripheral nerves by spatially-varying pressure fields. Our findings show that LIFUS offers distinct parametric sub-spaces to selectively recruit myelinated or unmyelinated axons and modulate their spiking activity over physiologically relevant regimes and within safe exposure limits. This singular feature, explained by fiber-specific differences in membrane electromechanical coupling, consistently explains recent empirical findings and suggests that LIFUS can preferentially target nociceptive and sensory fibers to enable peripheral therapeutic applications not addressable by electric stimulation. These results open up new opportunities for the development of more selective and effective peripheral neuroprostheses. Our framework can be readily applied to other neural targets to establish application-specific LIFUS protocols.",

    "abstract": "Multiple theories have proposed that increasing central arousal through the brains locus coeruleus - norepinephrine system may facilitate cognitive control and memory. However, for emotion research this hypothesis poses a puzzle, because conventionally, successful emotion regulation is associated with a decrease in arousal.\n\nPupil diameter is a proxy to infer upon the central arousal state. We employed an emotion regulation paradigm with a combination of design features that allowed us to dissociate regulation- from stimulus-associated arousal in the pupil diameter time course of healthy adults. A pupil diameter increase during regulation predicted individual differences in emotion regulation success beyond task difficulty. Moreover, the extent of this individual arousal boost predicted performance in another self-control task, dietary health challenges. Participants who harnessed more regulation-associated arousal during emotion regulation were also more successful in choosing healthier foods. These results suggest that a common arousal-based facilitation mechanism may support an individuals self-control across domains.",

    "abstract": "The use of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered regulatory T cells (Tregs) has emerged as a promising strategy to promote immune tolerance in transplantation. However, in conventional T cells (Tconvs), CAR expression is often associated with tonic signaling resulting from ligand-independent baseline activation. Tonic signaling may cause CAR-T cell dysfunction, especially when the CAR structure incorporates the CD28 costimulatory domain (CSD) rather than the 4-1BB CSD.\n\nHere, we explored the impact of tonic signaling on human CAR-Tregs according to the type of CSD. Compared to CD28-CAR-Tregs, 4-1BB-CAR-Tregs showed enhanced proliferation and greater activation of MAP kinase and mTOR pathways but exhibited decreased lineage stability and reduced abilities to produce IL-10 and be restimulated through the CAR. Although both CAR-Treg populations were suppressive in vivo, cell tracking with bioluminescence imaging found longer persistence for CD28-CAR-Tregs than for 4-1BB-CAR-Tregs. This study demonstrates that CD28-CAR best preserves Treg function and survival in the context of tonic signaling, in contrast with previous findings for Tconvs.\n\nSUMMARYLamarthee et al investigated the impact of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) tonic signaling on CAR-engineered Tregs according to the incorporated costimulatory domain (either CD28 or 4-1BB).

However, monitoring insects across space and time is challenging, due to their vast taxonomic and functional diversity. This study demonstrates how nets mounted on rooftops of cars (car nets) and DNA metabarcoding can be applied to sample flying insect diversity across a large spatial scale within a limited time period.\n\nDuring June 2018, 365 car net samples were collected by 151 volunteers during two daily time intervals on 218 routes in Denmark. Insect bulk samples were processed with a DNA metabarcoding protocol to estimate taxonomic composition, and the results were compared to known flying insect diversity and occurrence data.\n\nWe detected 15 out of 19 flying insect orders present in Denmark. Diptera. Psocoptera and Thysanoptera were overrepresented, while Hymenoptera, Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, Trichoptera, Odonata, Neuroptera and Plecoptera were underrepresented, compared to Danish estimates. We detected 319 species not known for Denmark. Our results indicate that this method can assess the flying insect fauna to a wide extent, but may be, like other methods, biased towards certain insect orders. Furthermore, car net sampling and DNA metabarcoding can update species records for Denmark while preserving specimens for natural history collections.",

One of the few remaining questions of order-level monophyly is that of Mecoptera in respect to the phylogenetic placement of Siphonaptera (fleas). We used a large set of transcriptomic nucleotide sequence data representing 56 species and more than 3,000 single-copy genes to resolve the evolutionary history of Antliophora, including fleas (Siphonaptera), scorpionflies and relatives (Mecoptera), and true flies (Diptera). We find that fleas and mecopterans together are the sister group of flies. However, our data and/or analyses are unable to distinguish whether fleas are sister to a monophyletic Mecoptera, or whether they arose from within extant mecopteran families, rendering Mecoptera paraphyletic. We did not detect parameter bias in our dataset after applying a broad range of detection methods. Counter to a previous hypothesis that placed fleas within Mecoptera as the sister group to wingless boreids (snow fleas), we found a potential sister group relationship between fleas and the enigmatic family Nannochoristidae. Although we lack conclusive evidence, it seems possible that fleas represent the most-species rich group of modern mecopterans and that their parasitic lifestyle and morphological adaptations have simply made them unrecognizable in respect to their order-level classification.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplications (WGD) have been considered as springboards that potentiate lineage diversification through increasing functional redundancy. Divergence in gene regulatory elements is a central mechanism for evolutionary diversification, yet the patterns and processes governing regulatory divergence following events that lead to massive functional redundancy, such as WGD, remain largely unknown. We studied the patterns of divergence and strength of natural selection on regulatory elements in the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) genome, which has undergone WGD 100-80 Mya. Using ChIPmentation, we first show that H3K27ac, a histone modification typical to enhancers and promoters, is associated with genic regions, tissue specific transcription factor binding motifs, and with gene transcription levels in immature testes. Divergence in transcription between duplicated genes from WGD (ohnologs) correlated with difference in the number of proximal regulatory elements, but not with promoter elements, suggesting that functional divergence between ohnologs after WGD is mainly driven by enhancers. By comparing H3K27ac regions between duplicated genome blocks, we further show that a longer polyploid state post-WGD has constrained asymmetric regulatory evolution. Patterns of genetic diversity across natural populations inferred from re-sequencing indicate that recent evolutionary pressures on H3K27ac regions are dominated by largely neutral evolution. In sum, our results suggest that post-WGD functional redundancy in regulatory elements continues to have an impact on the evolution of the salmon genome, promoting largely neutral evolution of regulatory elements despite their association with transcription levels. These results highlight a case where genome-wide regulatory evolution following an ancient WGD is dominated by genetic drift.\n\nSignificance statementRegulatory evolution following whole genome duplications (WGD) has been investigated at the gene expression level, but studies of the regulatory elements that control expression have been lacking. By investigating regulatory elements in the Atlantic salmon genome, which has undergone a whole genome duplication 100-80 million years ago, we discovered patterns suggesting that neutral divergence is the prevalent mode of regulatory element evolution post-WGD. Our results suggest mechanisms for explaining the prevalence of asymmetric gene expression evolution following whole genome duplication, as well as the mismatch between evolutionary rates in enhancers versus that of promoters.",

Nullisomic-tetrasomic lines for homoeologous group-7 of wheat revealed dosage effect of the gene, with tetrasomic 7A being more susceptible than control Chinese Spring wheat, qualifying it as a bonafide susceptibility factor.

    "abstract": "Despite the advantages of fewer missing values by collecting fragment ion data on all analytes in the sample, as well as the potential for deeper coverage, the adoption of data-independent acquisition (DIA) in core facility settings has been slow. The Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities conducted a large interlaboratory study to evaluate DIA performance in laboratories with various instrumentation. Participants were supplied with generic methods and a uniform set of test samples. The resulting 49 DIA datasets act as benchmarks and have utility in education and tool development. The sample set consisted of a tryptic HeLa digest spiked with high or low levels of four exogenous proteins. Data are available in MassIVE MSV000086479. Additionally, we demonstrate how the data can be analysed by focusing on two datasets using different library approaches and show the utility of select summary statistics. These data can be used by DIA newcomers, software developers, or DIA experts evaluating performance with different platforms, acquisition settings and skill levels.",

    "abstract": "A substantial fraction of the bacterial cytosol is occupied by catalysts and their substrates. While a higher volume density of catalysts and substrates might boost biochemical fluxes, the resulting molecular crowding can slow down diffusion, perturb the reactions Gibbs free energies, and reduce the catalytic efficiency of proteins. Due to these tradeoffs, dry mass density likely possesses an optimum that facilitates maximal cellular growth and that is interdependent on the cytosolic molecule size distribution. Here, we analyze the balanced growth of a model cell, accounting systematically for crowding effects on reaction kinetics. Its optimal cytosolic volume occupancy depends on the nutrient-dependent resource allocation into large ribosomal vs. small metabolic macromolecules, reflecting a tradeoff between the saturation of metabolic enzymes, favoring larger occupancies with higher encounter rates, and the inhibition of the ribosomes, favoring lower occupancies with unhindered diffusion of tRNAs. Our predictions across growth rates are quantitatively consistent with the experimentally observed reduction in volume occupancy on rich media compared to minimal media in E. coli. Strong deviations from optimal cytosolic occupancy only lead to minute reductions in growth rate, which are nevertheless evolutionarily relevant due to large bacterial population sizes. In sum, cytosolic density variation in bacterial cells appears to be consistent with an optimality principle of cellular efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, modern medicine is looking for new, more gentle, and more efficient diagnostic methods. A pathological state of an organism is often closely connected with increased amount of reactive oxygen species. They can react with biomolecules and subsequent reactions can lead to very low endogenous light emission (biological autoluminescence -BAL). This phenomenon can be potentially used as a non-invasive and low-operation-cost tool for monitoring oxidative stress during diseases. To contribute to the understanding of the parameters affecting BAL, we analyzed the BAL from yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a representative eukaryotic organism. The relationship between the BAL intensity and the amount of reactive oxygen species that originates as a result of the Fenton reaction as well as correlation between spontaneous BAL and selected physical and chemical parameters (pH, oxygen partial pressure, and cell concentration) during cell growth were established. Our results contribute to real-time non-invasive methodologies for monitoring oxidative processes in biomedicine and biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency is an endemic problem existing worldwide. Although several strategies were established to enhance vitamin D3 levels, studies specifically focussing inhibition of vitamin D metabolism which may prolong the availability of active vitamin D in pathological conditions are less explored. Studies also suggest that higher doses of vitamin D3 fail to achieve optimum vitamin D levels. In this context, we focussed on the enzyme CYP3A4 which promotes inactivation of active vitamin D. The current study was aimed to decipher the impact of chrysin, a proven CYP3A4 inhibitor as an intervention and its effects in combination with low dose vitamin D3 (40 IU) and bone health in vitamin D deficiency condition. The in-vivo activity of chrysin was evaluated on female Wistar albino rats fed with a vitamin D deficient diet to attain vitamin D deficiency for 28 days. Chrysin was given alone and in combination with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) and/or vitamin D3. All the therapeutic interventions were assessed for serum 25-OH-D3 by LC-MS, biochemical, urinary, and bone parameters. Animals treated with chrysin alone and in combination with low dose vitamin D3 and/or CaCO3 showed an eminent rise in serum 25-OH-D3 levels along with increased serum biochemical parameters. On contrary, a significant decrease in the urinary parameters followed by beneficial effects on bone parameters was noticed in contrast with the vitamin D deficient diet group. Our findings revealed that although chrysin alone showed a notable effect on 25-OH-D3 and osseous tissue, comparatively it showed intensified therapeutic effect in combination with vitamin D3 and CaCO3 which can be employed as a cost-effective option to improve bone health.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=165 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/390757v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10769corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@db1157org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4f7694org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f20f88_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Background/ObjectiveIn the field of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, it is essential to measure individual functional capacity, which could be evaluated through walking tests. Aside from the commonly used six minutes walking test (6MWT), four meter gait speed (4MGS) are widely used for its practicality. This study aimed to assess the agreement between 4 MGS and the 6MWT in Indonesian healthy adults.\n\nMethodsThis agreement analysis study had recruited 61 healthy and sedentary Indonesians aged 18 until 50 years old, and they were instructed to perform three tests, namely 6MWT and 4MGS with six meters and eight meters track. These gait speed were then compared to assess validity.\n\nResultsMean gait speed results for males in 6MWT is 1.602 m/s, whereas 4MGS in six meter track is 2.114 m/s and similarly 2.108 m/s in the eight meter track. Females on the other hand, achieved 1.462 m/s for 6MWT, 1.908 m/s and 1.986 m/s for 4MGS in six and eight meter simultaneously. Bland Altman Agreement test between the 6MWT and 4MGS shows scatter dots with close limit of agreement, thus showing a good agreement between the 6MWT and 4 MGS with both tracks.\n\nDiscussionBoth track length of 4 MGS were in a good agreement with 6MWT for functional capacity assessment.\n\nConclusionsIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic era, shorter track of 4MGS (six meters) can be feasibly utilized. It is evident that shorter duration and track will boost the tests practicality in assessing functional capacity for both inpatient and outpatient settings.",

We developed a chemical probe to monitor how glutamate affects the density and distribution of astrocytic L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (LTCC).\n\nProceduresThe imaging probe FluoBar1 was created from a barbiturate ligand modified with a fluorescent coumarin moiety. The probe selectivity was examined with colocalization analyses of confocal fluorescence imaging in U118-MG and transfected COS-7 cells. Living cells treated with 50 nM FluoBar1 were imaged in real time to reveal changes in density and distribution of astrocytic LTCCs upon exposure to glutamate.\n\nResultsFluoBar1 was synthesized in ten steps. The selectivity of the probe was demonstrated with immunoblotting and confocal imaging of immunostained cells expressing the CaV1.2 isoform of LTCCs proteins. Applying FluoBar1 to astrocyte model cells U118-MG allowed us to measure a 5-fold increase in fluorescence density of LTCCs upon glutamate exposure.\n\nConclusionsImaging probe FluoBar1 allows the real-time monitoring of LTCCs in living cells, revealing for first time that glutamate causes a rapid increase of LTCC membranar density in astrocyte model cells. FluoBar1 may help tackle previously intractable questions about LTCC dynamics in cellular events.",

    "abstract": "Mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a class of innate-like T cells that utilize a semi-invariant {beta} T cell receptor to recognize small molecule ligands produced by bacteria and fungi. Despite growing evidence that immune cells at mucosal surfaces are often phenotypically and functionally distinct from those in the peripheral circulation, knowledge about the characteristics of MAIT cells at the lung mucosal surface, the site of exposure to respiratory pathogens, is limited. HIV infection has been shown to have a profound effect on the number and function of MAIT cells in the peripheral blood, but its effect on lung mucosal MAIT cells is unknown. We examined the phenotypic, functional, and transcriptomic features of MR1 restricted MAIT cells from the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar compartments of otherwise healthy individuals with latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection who were either HIV uninfected or HIV infected. Peripheral blood MAIT cells consistently co-expressed typical MAIT cell surface markers CD161 and CD26 in healthy individuals, while paired bronchoalveolar MAIT cells displayed heterogenous expression of these markers. Bronchoalveolar MAIT cells produced lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-{gamma} and expressed higher levels of co-inhibitory markers PD-1 and TIM-3 than peripheral MAIT cells. HIV infection resulted in decreased frequencies and pro-inflammatory function of peripheral blood MAIT cells, while in the bronchoalveolar compartment MAIT cell frequency was decreased but phenotype and function were not significantly altered. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis demonstrated greater heterogeneity among bronchoalveolar compared to peripheral blood MAIT cells and suggested a distinct subset in the bronchoalveolar compartment. The transcriptional features of this bronchoalveolar subset were associated with atypical MAIT cells and tissue repair functions. In summary, we found previously undescribed phenotypic and transcriptional heterogeneity of bronchoalveolar MAIT cells in healthy people. In HIV infection, we found numeric depletion of MAIT cells in both anatomical compartments but preservation of the novel phenotypic and transcriptional features of bronchoalveolar MAIT cells.",

    "abstract": "After centuries of genetic studies, one of the most fundamental questions, i.e. in what cell types do DNA mutations regulate a phenotype, remains unanswered for most complex phenotypes. The current availability of hundreds of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of millions of cells provides a unique opportunity to address the question. In the present study, we firstly constructed an association landscape between over 20,000 single cell clusters and 997 complex phenotypes by a cross annotation framework with scRNA-seq expression profiles and GWAS summary statistics. We then performed an extensive overview of cell-type specificity and pleiotropy in human phenotypes and found most phenotypes (>90%) were moderately selectively associated with a limited number of cell types while a small fraction cell types (<10%) had strong pleiotropy in multiple phenotypes (~100). Moreover, we identified three cell type-phenotype mutual pleiotropy blocks in the landscape. The application of the single cell type-phenotype cross annotation framework (named SPA) also explained the T cell biased lymphopenia and suggested important supporting genes in severe COVID-19 from human genetics angle. All the cell type-phenotype association results can be queried and visualized at http://pmglab.top/spa.",

Cell death activity of many NLRs requires oligomerization and in some cases plasma membrane (PM) localization. However, the exact mechanisms underlying PM localization of NLRs lacking recognizable N- or C-terminal lipidation motifs or predicted transmembrane domains remains elusive. Here we show that the PM localization and stability of members of the RPW8-like coiled-coil (CCR) domain NLRs (RNLs) and a CC-type NLR (CNL) depend on the interaction with PM phospholipids. Depletion of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) from the PM led to a mislocalization of the analyzed NLRs and consequently inhibited their cell death activity. We further demonstrate activation-dependent self-association of cell death inducing RNLs. Our results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of NLR PM localization and defines an important role of phospholipids for CNL and RNL activity during immunity.",

    "abstract": "Clonal populations of microbial and cancer cells are often driven into a drug-tolerant persister state in response to drug therapy, and these persisters can subsequently adapt to the new drug environment via genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Estimating the frequency with which drug-tolerance states arise, and its transition to drug-resistance, is critical for designing efficient treatment schedules. Here we study a stochastic model of cell proliferation where drug-tolerant persister cells transform into a drug-resistant state with a certain adaptation rate, and the resistant cells can then proliferate in the presence of the drug. Assuming a random number of persisters to begin with, we derive an exact analytical expression for the statistical moments and the distribution of the total cell count (i.e., colony size) over time. Interestingly, for Poisson initial conditions the noise in the colony size (as quantified by the Fano factor) becomes independent of the initial condition and only depends on the adaptation rate. Thus, experimentally quantifying the fluctuations in the colony sizes provides an estimate of the adaptation rate, which then can be used to infer the starting persister numbers from the mean colony size. Overall, our analysis introduces a modification of the classical Luria-Delbruck experiment, also called the \"Fluctuation Test\", providing a valuable tool to quantify the emergence of drug resistance in cell populations.",

Activation of mTORC1 by amino acids and growth factors involves recruitment of the complex to the lysosomal membrane and is further supported by lysosome distribution to the cell periphery1-4. Here we show that translocation of lysosomes towards the cell periphery brings mTORC1 into proximity with focal adhesions (FAs). We demonstrate that FAs constitute discrete plasma membrane hubs mediating growth factor signaling and amino acid input into the cell. FAs, as well as the translocation of lysosome-bound mTORC1 to their vicinity, are necessary for both peripheral and intracellular mTORC1 activity. Conversely, lysosomal distribution to the cell periphery is dispensable for the activation of mTORC1 constitutively targeted to FAs. This study advances our understanding of spatial mTORC1 regulation by demonstrating that the localization of mTORC1 to FAs is both necessary and sufficient for its activation by growth-promoting stimuli.",

    "abstract": "According to the current consensus, neural stem cells (NSCs) apically contacting the lateral ventricle generate differentiated progenitors by rare asymmetric divisions or by relocating to the basal side of the ventricular-subventricular zone V-SVZ. Both processes will then ultimately lead to the generation of adult-born olfactory bulb (OB) interneurons. In contrast to this view, we here found that adult-born OB interneurons largely derive from an additional NSC type resident in the basal V-SVZ. Despite being both capable of self-renewal and long-term quiescence, apical and basal NSCs differ in Nestin expression, primary cilia extension and frequency of cell division. The expression of Notch-related genes also differed between the two NSC groups and Notch-activation was greatest in apical NSCs. Apical downregulation of Notch-effector Hes1 decreased Notch activation while increasing proliferation across the niche and neurogenesis from apical NSCs. Underscoring their different roles in neurogenesis, lactation-dependent increase in neurogenesis was paralleled by extra activation of basal but not apical NSCs. Thus, basal NSCs support OB neurogenesis whereas apical NSCs impart Notch-mediated lateral inhibition across the V-SVZ.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian development is associated with extensive changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and nuclear structure. Here, we follow such changes associated with mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation and X inactivation by integrating, for the first time, allele-specific data obtained by high-throughput single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and Hi-C. In differentiated cells, contact decay profiles, which clearly distinguish the active and inactive X chromosomes, reveal loss of the inactive X-specific structure at mitosis followed by a rapid reappearance, suggesting a  bookkeeping mechanism. In differentiating embryonic stem cells, changes in contact decay profiles are detected in parallel on both the X chromosomes and autosomes, suggesting profound simultaneous reorganization. The onset of the inactive X-specific structure in single cells is notably delayed relative to that of gene silencing, consistent with the idea that chromatin compaction is a late event of X inactivation. Novel computational approaches to effectively align single-cell gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and 3D chromosome structure reveal that long-range structural changes to chromosomes appear as discrete events, unlike progressive changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that persons with Parkinsons disease (pwPD) share specific deficits in learning new sequential movements, but the neural substrates of this impairment remain unclear. In addition, the degree to which striatal dopaminergic denervation in PD affects the cortico-striato-cerebellar motor learning network remains unknown. We aimed to answer these questions using fMRI in 16 pwPD and 16 healthy age-matched control subjects while they performed an implicit motor sequence learning task. While learning was absent in both pwPD and controls assessed with reaction time differences between sequential and random trials, larger error-rates during the latter suggest that at least some of the complex sequence was encoded. Moreover, we found that while healthy controls could improve general task performance indexed by decreased reaction times across both sequence and random blocks, pwPD could not, suggesting disease-specific deficits in learning of stimulus-response associations. Using fMRI, we found that this effect in pwPD was correlated with decreased activity in the hippocampus over time. Importantly, activity in the substantia nigra (SN) and adjacent bilateral midbrain was specifically increased during sequence learning in pwPD compared to healthy controls, and significantly correlated with sequence-specific learning deficits. As increased SN activity was also associated (on trend) with higher doses of dopaminergic medication as well as disease duration, the results suggest that learning deficits in PD are associated with disease progression, indexing an increased drive to recruit dopaminergic neurons in the SN, however unsuccessfully. Finally, we found no differences between pwPD and controls in task modulation of the cortico-striato-cerebellar network. Notably, in both groups Bayesian model selection revealed cortico-cerebellar connections modulated by the task, suggesting that despite behavioral and activation differences, the same cortico-cerebellar circuitry is recruited for implementing the motor task.",

    "abstract": "The invasive tomato leaf miner (TLM), Tuta absoluta (Meyrick) is an invasive pest on tomatoes worldwide. The main control measure against the pest has been chemical insecticides, but the pest developed resistance to many chemical classes. So alternative methods, such as biological control agents, alone or combined to chemical compounds must be evaluated to validate their synergistic actions. In this study, both lethal (concentration-mortality response) and sublethal effects of three synthetic insecticides, the bioinsecticide spinosad, as well as the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin were studied on Trichogramma brassicae Bezdenko within T. absoluta eggs. To assess the sublethal effects, the lethal concentration 25% (LC25) of chlorantraniliprole, spinosad, abamectin and indoxacarb and LC50 value of M. anisopliae was sprayed on eggs and then offered at three time intervals to the parasitoids. Fertility and other life table parameters of the individuals emerged from treated eggs were estimated. The results showed that indoxacarb showed the highest deleterious sublethal effects on T. brassicae. On the other hand, M. anisopliae was the safest treatment to combine to Trichogramma with no significant effect on some parameters. The lowest LC50 value for T. brassicae was obtained for chlorantraniliprole followed by spinosad. Synergistic effect was observed when M. anisopliae and T. brassicae used together. Hence, this will be a promising integration against T. absoluta.",

Disease transmission could be interrupted with universal, facility-wide testing with rapid turnaround every three days.\n\nConclusionsTesting a subset of individuals in congregate settings can improve early detection of small outbreaks of COVID-19. Frequent universal diagnostic testing can be used to interrupt transmission within a facility, but its efficacy is reliant on rapid turnaround of results for isolation of infected individuals.",

    "abstract": "In previous studies, we reported evidence showing that chronic cola consumption in rats impairs pancreatic metabolism of insulin and glucagon and produces some alterations typically observed in the metabolic syndrome (i.e, hyperglycemia, and hypertriglyceridemia) with an increase in oxidative stress. Of note, no apoptosis nor proliferation of islet cells could be demonstrated. In the present study, 36 male Wistar rats were divided in three groups to freely drink regular cola, light cola, or water (controls). We assessed the impact of the three different beverages in glucose tolerance, lipid levels, creatinine levels and immunohistochemical changes addressed for the expression of insulin, glucagon, PDX-1 and NGN3 in islet cells, to evaluate the possible participation of PDX-1 in the changes observed in  and {beta} cells after 6 months of treatment. On the other hand, we assessed by stereological methods, the mean volume of islets (Vi) and three important variables, the fractional {beta}-cell area, the cross-sectional area of alpha (A -cell) and beta cells (A {beta}-cell), and the number of {beta} and  cell per body weight.\n\nCola drinking caused impaired glucose tolerance as well as fasting hyperglycemia and increase of insulin immunolabeling. Immunohistochemical expression for PDX-1 was significantly high in regular cola consumption group compared to control. In this case, we observed cytoplasmatic and nuclear localization. Likewise, a mild but significant decrease of Vi was detected after 6 months of cola drink consumption compared with control group. Also, we observed a significant decrease of fractional {beta} cell area compared with control rats. Accordingly, a reduced mean value of islet  and {beta} cell number per body weight compared to control was detected. Interestingly, consumption of light cola increased the Vi compared to control. In line with this, a decreased cross-sectional area of {beta}-cells was observed after chronic consumption of both, regular and light cola, compared to controls. On the other hand, NGN3 was negative in all three groups. Our results support for the first time, the idea that TDX-1 plays a key role in the dynamics of the pancreatic islets after chronic consumption of sweetened beverages. The loss of islets cells might be attributed to autophagy, favored by the local metabolic conditions.",

A closely-related protein, Surfactant Protein A (SP-A), is present in the mouse retina and is associated with neovascularization (NV) in the Oxygen-Induced Retinopathy (OIR) mouse model, mimicking retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). We hypothesized that SP-D would be present in the retina and is also associated with OIR and ROP, which is one of the leading causes of pediatric blindness due to increasing survival rates of extremely preterm newborns. In our study, we did not detect SP-D in the mouse retina through proteomic and genomic investigation at baseline and in pathways known to up-regulate SP-D in other mammal tissues. It is therefore unlikely that SP-D participates in neovascularization in the mouse retina.",

    "abstract": "Lipoarabinomannan (LAM), an amphiphilic lipoglycan of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall, is a diagnostic target for tuberculosis. Previous work from our laboratory and others suggests that LAM is associated with host serum lipoproteins, which may in turn have implications for diagnostic assays. Our team has developed two serum assays for amphiphile detection: lipoprotein capture and membrane insertion. The lipoprotein capture assay relies on capture of the host lipoproteins, exploiting the biological association of host lipoprotein with microbial amphiphilic biomarkers to \"concentrate\" LAM. In contrast, the membrane insertion assay is independent of the association between pathogen amphiphiles and host lipoprotein association, and directly captures LAM based on its thermodynamic propensity for association with a supported lipid membrane, which forms the functional surface of an optical biosensor. In this manuscript, we explored the use of these assays for the detection of LAM in sera from adults whose tuberculosis status had been well-characterized using conventional microbiological tests, and endemic controls. Using the lipoprotein capture assay, LAM signal/noise ratios were >1.0 in 29/35 (83%) individuals with culture-confirmed active tuberculosis, 8/13 (62%) individuals with tuberculosis symptoms but no positive culture for M. tuberculosis, and 0/6 (0%) symptom-free endemic controls. To evaluate serum LAM levels without bias associated with potential differences in circulating host lipoprotein concentrations between individuals, we subsequently processed available samples to liberate LAM from associated host lipoprotein assemblies followed by direct detection of the pathogen biomarker using the membrane insertion approach. Using the membrane insertion assay, signal/noise for detection of serum LAM was greater than that observed using the lipoprotein capture method for culture-confirmed TB patients (6/6), yet remained negative for controls (2/2). Taken together, these results suggest that detection of serum LAM is a promising TB diagnostic approach. Further work is required to optimize assay performance and to decipher the implications of LAM/host lipoprotein associations for diagnostic assay performance and TB pathogenesis.",

Vernal pool branchiopods are particularly at risk from vernal pool habitat loss and conservation efforts have targeted their long-term protection through the establishment of preserves and conservation banks. These conservation strategies require repeated, perpetual monitoring of preserved habitat, which is currently carried out through dip-net surveys and visual identification of specimens. Dip-netting may be destructive and frequently requires some sacrifice of protected species. Environmental DNA offers a new, modern method to monitor many protected freshwater organisms. We designed qPCR-based species-specific assays for four of Californias vernal pool branchiopods: The Vernal Pool Fairy Shrimp Branchinecta lynchi (BRLY), the Midvalley Fairy Shrimp Branchinecta mesovallensis (BRME), and the Conservancy Fairy Shrimp Branchinecta conservatio (BRCO), and the Vernal Pool Tadpole Shrimp Lepidurus packardi (LEPA). We tested these assays using eDNA sampling protocols alongside traditional dip-net surveys to assess their viability as an alternative method to monitor vernal pool branchiopods. Based on occupancy modeling, each of our assays achieved a 95% or higher detection rate when using optimized sampling protocols.",

    "abstract": "Technologies for profiling samples using different omics platforms have been at the forefront since the human genome project. Large-scale multi-omics data hold the promise of deciphering different regulatory layers. Yet, while there is a myriad of bioinformatics tools, each multi-omics analysis appears to start from scratch with an arbitrary decision over which tools to use and how to combine them. It is therefore an unmet need to conceptualize how to integrate such data and to implement and validate pipelines in different cases. We have designed a conceptual framework (STATegra), aiming it to be as generic as possible for multi-omics analysis, combining machine learning component analysis, non-parametric data combination and a multi-omics exploratory analysis in a step-wise manner. While in several studies we have previously combined those integrative tools, here we provide a systematic description of the STATegra framework and its validation using two TCGA case studies. For both, the Glioblastoma and the Skin Cutaneous Melanoma cases, we demonstrate an enhanced capacity to identify features in comparison to single-omics analysis. Such an integrative multi-omics analysis framework for the identification of features and components facilitates the discovery of new biology. Finally, we provide several options for applying the STATegra framework when parametric assumptions are fulfilled, and for the case when not all the samples are profiled for all omics. The STATegra framework is built using several tools, which are being integrated step-by-step as OpenSource in the STATegRa Bioconductor package https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/STATegra.html.",

    "abstract": "Although most genes share their chromosomal neighbourhood with other genes, distribution of genes has not been explored in the context of individual organ development; the common focus of developmental biology studies. Because developmental processes are often associated with initially subtle changes in gene expression, here we explored whether neighbouring genes are informative in the identification of differentially expressed genes. First, we quantified the chromosomal neighbourhood patterns of genes having related functional roles in the mammalian genome. Although the majority of protein coding genes have at least five neighbours within 1 Mb window around each gene, very few of these neighbours regulate development of the same organ. Analyses of transcriptomes of developing mouse molar teeth revealed that whereas expression of genes regulating tooth development changes, their neighbouring genes show no marked changes, irrespective of their level of expression. Finally, we test whether inclusion of gene neighbourhood in the analyses of differential expression could provide additional benefits. For the analyses, we developed an algorithm, called DELocal that identifies differentially expressed genes by comparing their expression changes to changes in adjacent genes in their chromosomal regions. Our results show that DELocal removes detection bias towards large changes in expression, thereby allowing identification of even subtle changes in development. Future studies, including the detection of differential expression, may benefit from, and further characterize the significance of gene-gene neighbour relationships.\n\nAuthor SummaryDevelopment of organs is typically associated with small and hard to detect changes in gene expression. Here we examined how often genes regulating specific organs are neighbours to each other in the genome, and whether this gene neighbourhood helps in the detection of changes in gene expression. We found that genes regulating individual organ development are very rarely close to each other in the mouse and human genomes. We built an algorithm, called DELocal, to detect changes in gene expression that incorporates information about neighbouring genes. Using transcriptomes of developing mouse molar teeth containing gene expression profiles of thousands of genes, we show how genes regulating tooth development are ranked high by DELocal even if their expression level changes are subtle. We propose that developmental biology studies can benefit from gene neighbourhood analyses in the detection of differential expression and identification of organ specific genes.",

    "abstract": "While light is the ultimate source of energy for photosynthetic organisms, mitochondrial respiration is still fundamental for supporting metabolism demand during the night or in heterotrophic tissues. Respiration is also important for the metabolism of photosynthetically active cells, acting as a sink for excess reduced molecules and source of substrates for anabolic pathways. In this work, we isolated Physcomitrella (Physcomitrium patens) plants with altered respiration by inactivating Complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain by independent targeting of two essential subunits. Results show that the inactivation of Complex I causes a strong growth impairment even in fully autotrophic conditions in tissues where all cells are photosynthetically active. Complex I mutants show major alterations in the stoichiometry of respiratory complexes while the composition of photosynthetic apparatus was substantially unaffected. Complex I mutants showed altered photosynthesis with higher yields of both Photosystems I and II. These are the consequence of a higher chloroplast ATPase activity that also caused a smaller {Delta}pH formation across thylakoid membranes as well as decreased photosynthetic control on cytochrome b6f, possibly to compensate for a deficit in ATP supply relative to demand in Complex I mutants. These results demonstrate that alteration of respiratory activity directly impacts photosynthesis in P. patens and that metabolic interaction between organelles is essential in their ability to use light energy for growth.",

    "abstract": "Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon caused by the biased expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles. In flowering plants, genomic imprinting predominantly occurs in triploid endosperm and plays a vital role in seed development. In this study, we identified 241 candidate imprinted genes including 143 maternally expressed imprinted genes (MEGs) and 98 paternally expressed imprinted genes (PEGs) in flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) endosperm using deep RNA sequencing. The conservation of imprinting in plants is very limited and imprinting clustering is not a general feature. MEGs tends to be endosperm expression specific, while PEGs are non-tissue specific. Imprinted SNPs differentiated 200 flax cultivars into oil flax, oil-fiber dual purpose flax (OF) and fiber flax subgroups, suggesting that genomic imprinting contributes to intraspecific variation in flax. The nucleotide diversity ({pi}) of imprinted genes in oil flax subgroup is significantly higher than that in fiber flax subgroup, indicating that some imprinted genes undergo positive selection during flax domestication from oil flax to fiber flax. Imprinted genes undergo positive selection is related to the functions. Eleven imprinted genes related to seed size and weight were identified using the candidate gene-based association study. Our study provides information for further exploring the function and genomic variation of imprinted genes in flax population.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) has been commonly used to measure brain alterations in Alzheimers Disease (AD). However, reported changes are limited to those obtained from using univariate measures, including activation level and frequency bands. To look beyond the activation level, we used multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to extract patterns of information from EEG responses to images in an animacy categorization task. Comparing healthy controls (HC) with patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we found that the neural speed of animacy information processing is decreased in MCI patients. Moreover, we found critical time-points during which the representational pattern of animacy for MCI patients was significantly discriminable from that of HC, while the activation level remained unchanged. Together, these results suggest that the speed and pattern of animacy information processing provide clinically useful information as a potential biomarker for detecting early changes in MCI and AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Type III protein secretion is widespread in Gram-negative pathogens. It comprises the injectisome with a surface-exposed needle and an inner membrane translocase. The translocase contains the SctRSTU export channel enveloped by the export gate subunit SctV that binds chaperone/exported clients and forms a putative ante- chamber. We probed the assembly, function, structure and dynamics of SctV from enteropathogenic E.coli (EPEC). In both EPEC and E.coli lab strains, SctV forms peripheral oligomeric clusters that are detergent-extracted as homo-nonamers. Membrane-embedded SctV9 is necessary and sufficient to act as a receptor for different chaperone/exported protein pairs with distinct C-domain binding sites that are essential for secretion. Negative staining electron microscopy revealed that peptidisc-reconstituted His-SctV9 forms a tripartite particle of [~]22 nm with a N- terminal domain connected by a short linker to a C-domain ring structure with a [~]5 nm-wide inner opening. The isolated C-domain ring was resolved with cryo-EM at 3.1 [A] and structurally compared to other SctV homologues. Its four sub-domains undergo a three-stage \"pinching\" motion. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry revealed this to involve dynamic and rigid hinges and a hyper-flexible sub-domain that flips out of the ring periphery and binds chaperones on and between adjacent protomers. These motions are coincident with pore surface and ring entry mouth local conformational changes that are also modulated by the ATPase inner stalk. We propose a model that the intrinsic dynamics of the SctV protomer are modulated by chaperones and the ATPase and could affect allosterically the other subunits of the nonameric ring during secretion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSmall RNAs are short non-coding RNAs that are key gene regulators controlling various biological processes in eukaryotes. Plants may regulate discrete sets of sRNAs in response to pathogen attack. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum is an economically important pathogen affecting hundreds of plant species, including the economically important oilseed Brassica napus. However, there are limited studies on how regulation of sRNAs occurs in the S. sclerotiorum and B. napus pathosystem.\n\nResultsWe identified different classes of sRNAs from B. napus by high throughput sequencing of replicated mock and infected samples at 24 hours post-inoculation (HPI). Overall, 3,999 sRNA loci were highly expressed, of which 730 were significantly upregulated during infection. Degradome sequencing identified numerous likely sRNA targets that were enriched for immunity-related GO terms, including those related to jasmonic acid signalling, during infection. A total of 73 conserved miRNA families were identified in our dataset. Degradome sequencing identified 434 unique cleaved mRNA products from these miRNAs, of which 50 were unique to the infected library. A novel miR1885-triggered disease resistance gene-derived secondary sRNA locus was identified and verified with degradome sequencing. We also experimentally validated silencing of a plant immunity related ethylene response factor gene by a novel sRNA using 5-RACE.\n\nConclusionsThe findings in this study expand the framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms of the S. sclerotiorum and B. napus pathosystem at the sRNA level.",

    "abstract": "Deletion of mitochondrial DNA in eukaryotes is mainly attributed to rare accidental events associated with mitochondrial replication or repair of double-strand breaks. We report the discovery that yeast cells arrest harmful intramitochondrial superoxide production by shutting down respiration through genetically controlled deletion of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes. We show that the regulatory circuitry underlying this editing critically involves the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase 2 and two-way mitochondrial-nuclear communication. While mitochondrial DNA homeostasis is rapidly restored after cessation of a short-term superoxide stress, long-term stress causes maladaptive persistence of the deletion process, leading to complete annihilation of the cellular pool of intact mitochondrial genomes and irrevocable loss of respiratory ability. Our results may therefore be of etiological as well as therapeutic importance with regard to age-related mitochondrial impairment and disease.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryGenetically controlled editing of mitochondrial DNA is an integral part of the yeasts defenses against oxidative damage.",

    "abstract": "On the sea floor, prey and predator commonly engage in a chemical warfare. Here, sponges thrive due to their specific and diverse chemical arsenal. Yet, some animals use these chemically-defended organisms as food and home. Most research on sponge chemical ecology has characterized crude extracts and investigated defences against generalist predators like fish. Consequently, we know little about intraindividual chemical dynamics and responses to specialist grazers. Here, we studied the response of the sponge Aplysina aerophoba to grazing by the opistobranch Tylodina perversa, in comparison to mechanical damage, at the cellular (via microscopy) and chemical level (via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry). We characterized the distribution of two major brominated compounds in A. aerophoba, aerophobin-2 and aeroplysinin-1, and identified a generalized wounding response that was similar in both wounding treatments: (i) brominated compound-carrying cells (spherulous cells) accumulated at the wound and (ii) secondary metabolites reallocated to the sponge surface. Upon mechanical damage, the wound turned dark due to oxidized compounds, causing T. perversa deterrence. During grazing, T. perversas way of feeding prevented oxidation. Thus, the sponge has not evolved a specific response to this specialist predator, but rather relies on rapid regeneration and flexible allocation of constitutive defences.",

    "abstract": "The environmental context of the nitrogen-fixing mutualism between leguminous plants and rhizobial bacteria varies over space and time. Variation in resource availability, population density, and composition likely affect the ecology and evolution of rhizobia and their symbiotic interactions with hosts. We examined how host genotype, nitrogen addition, rhizobial density, and community complexity affected selection on 68 rhizobia strains in the Ensifer meliloti - Medicago truncatula mutualism. As expected, the host genotype had the most substantial effect on the size, number, and strain composition of root nodules (the symbiotic organ). The understudied environmental variable of rhizobial density had a more significant effect on strain frequency in nodules than the addition of low nitrogen levels. Higher inoculum density resulted in a nodule community that was less diverse and more beneficial but only in the context of the more selective host genotype. Higher density resulted in more diverse and less beneficial nodule communities with the less selective host. Density effects on strain composition deserve additional scrutiny as they can create eco-evolutionary feedback. Lastly, we found that relative strain rankings were stable across increasing community complexity (community complexity (2, 3, 8, or 68 strains). This unexpected result suggests that higher-order interactions between strains are rare in the context of host nodule formation and development. Taken together, our empirical work highlights the importance of developing new theoretical predictions that incorporate density dependence. Further, it has translational relevance for overcoming establishment barriers in bio-inoculants and motivating host breeding programs that maintain beneficial plant-microbe interactions across diverse agro-ecological contexts.\n\nIMPORTANCELegume cash, forage, and cover crops establish beneficial associations with rhizobial bacteria who perform biological nitrogen fixation (BNF)--providing Nitrogen (N) fertilizer to plants without the economic and greenhouse gas emission costs of chemical N inputs. Here, for the first time, we examine the relative influence of three environmental factors that vary in agricultural fields on strain relative fitness in nodules when scores rhizobial strains compete. In addition to manipulating Nitrogen, we also use two biotic variables that have rarely been examined: the rhizobial communitys density and complexity. Taken together, our results suggest 1) breeding legume varieties that select beneficial strains despite environmental variation are possible, 2) changes in rhizobial population densities that occur routinely in agricultural fields could drive evolutionary changes in rhizobia populations, and 3) the lack of higher-order interactions between strains will allow the high-throughput assessments of rhizobia winners and losers during plant interactions.",

    "abstract": "Coral larval settlement patterns are influenced by a vast array of factors; however, the relative roles of individual factors are rarely tested in isolation, leading to confusion about which are most crucial for settlement. For example, direct effects of light environment are often cited as a major determinate of settlement patterns, yet this has not been demonstrated under environmentally realistic lighting regimes in the absence of confounding factors. Here we apply programmable multispectral lights to create realistic light spectra, while removing correlating (but not obvious) factors that are common in laboratory settlement experiments. Using two common species of Acropora - key framework builders of the Great Barrier Reef - we find little evidence that light intensity or changes in the spectral profile play a substantial role in larval settlement under most environmentally realistic settings but can under more extreme or artificial settings. We alternatively hypothesise and provide evidence that chronic conditions of light and recent sediment exposures that impact benthic substrates (e.g., crustose coralline algae) preceding settlement have a greater impact, with up to 74% decrease in settlement observed on substrates with prior exposure and poor water quality conditions. Management of water quality conditions that impact the quality of benthic-settlement substrates therefore should present a priority area of focus for improving coral recruitment.",

    "abstract": "Pooled CRISPR screens have been used to identify genes responsible for specific phenotypes and diseases, and, more recently, to connect genetic perturbations with multi-dimensional gene expression profiles. Here, we describe a method to link genome-wide chromatin accessibility to genetic perturbations in single cells. This scalable, cost-effective method combines pooled CRISPR perturbations with a single-cell combinatorial indexing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (CRISPR-sciATAC). Using a human and mouse species-mixing experiment, we show that CRISPR-sciATAC separates single cells with a low doublet rate. Then, in human myelogenous leukemia cells, we apply CRISPR-sciATAC to target 21 chromatin-related genes that are frequently mutated in cancer and 84 subunits and cofactors of chromatin remodeling complexes, generating chromatin accessibility data for ~30,000 single cells. Using this large-scale atlas, we correlate loss of specific chromatin remodelers with changes in accessibility -- globally and at the binding sites of individual transcription factors. For example, we show that loss of the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 leads to increased accessibility at heterochromatic regions involved in embryonic development and triggers expression of multiple genes in the HOXA and HOXD clusters. At a subset of regulatory sites, we also analyze dynamic changes in nucleosome spacing upon loss of chromatin remodelers. CRISPR-sciATAC is a high-throughput, low-cost single-cell method that can be applied broadly to study the role of genetic perturbations on chromatin in normal and disease states.",

    "abstract": "Transgenerational transmission of epiphenotypes is poorly understood. Here we show that exposure of pregnant mouse F0 females to BPA results in obesity in the F2 progeny due to increased food intake and leptin resistance. This epiphenotype can be transmitted up to the F6 generation and disappears in F7. Analyses of chromatin accessibility in sperm of the F1-F6 generations reveals alterations in the binding of CTCF at two enhancers of the Fto gene in obese but not control animals that correlates with transmission of obesity. Deletion of the CTCF site in Fto results in mice that fail to become obese when exposed to BPA. These Fto enhancers show increased interactions in sperm of obese mice with the Irx3 and Irx5 genes, which are involved in the differentiation of appetite controlling AgRP/NPY neurons. Single-nucleus and immunofluorescence analyses in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus suggest that exposure to BPA results in expansion of the number of orexigenic AgRP neurons. This expansion correlates with increased accessibility of the Fto proximal enhancer in radial glia-like neural stem cells (RG-NSCs), which give rise to AgRP/NPY neurons, and in mature oligodendrocytes. The results provide a molecular mechanism for transgenerational inheritance in mammals and suggest that both genetic and epigenetic alterations of Fto can lead to the same phenotypic outcomes.",

We have observed strong association between these changes and gene expression only at the time of initial gene activation. Activation is preceded by H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, and followed in a precise order by most other histone modifications. Further changes in gene expression, comparable or even stronger than those at initial activation, occur without associated changes in histone modifications.

The design of manufacturing processes to produce subunit vaccines depends, however, on the inherent biophysical traits presented by an individual antigen of interest. New candidate antigens typically require developing custom processes for each one and may require unique steps to ensure sufficient yields without product-related variants.\n\nResultsWe describe a holistic approach for the molecular design of recombinant protein antigens--considering both their manufacturability and antigenicity--informed by bioinformatic analyses such as RNA-seq, ribosome profiling, and sequence-based prediction tools. We demonstrate this approach by engineering the product sequences of a trivalent non-replicating rotavirus vaccine (NRRV) candidate to improve titers and mitigate product variants caused by N-terminal truncation, hypermannosylation, and aggregation. The three engineered NRRV antigens retained their original antigenicity and immunogenicity, while their improved manufacturability enabled concomitant production and purification of all three serotypes in a single, end-to-end perfusion-based process using the biotechnical yeast Komagataella phaffii.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates that molecular engineering of subunit antigens using advanced genomic methods can facilitate their manufacturing in continuous production.
