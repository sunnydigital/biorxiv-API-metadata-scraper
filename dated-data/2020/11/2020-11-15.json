    "abstract": "In this study, we report a label-free bone marrow white blood cell classification framework that captures the three-dimensional (3D) refractive index (RI) distributions of individual cells and analyzes with deep learning. Without using labeling or staining processes, 3D RI distributions of individual white blood cells were exploited for accurate profiling of their subtypes. Powered by deep learning, our method used the high-dimensional information of the WBC RI tomogram voxels and achieved high accuracy. The results show >99 % accuracy for the binary classification of myeloids and lymphoids and >96 % accuracy for the four-type classification of B, T lymphocytes, monocytes, and myelocytes. Furthermore, the feature learning of our approach was visualized via an unsupervised dimension reduction technique. We envision that this framework can be integrated into existing workflows for blood cell investigation, thereby providing cost-effective and rapid diagnosis of hematologic malignancy.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR systems enable targeted genome editing in a wide variety of organisms by introducing single- or double-strand DNA breaks, which are repaired using endogenous molecular pathways. Characterization of on- and off-target editing events from CRISPR proteins can be evaluated using targeted genome resequencing. We characterized DNA repair footprints that result from non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) after double stranded breaks (DSBs) were introduced by Cas9 or Cas12a for >500 paired treatment/control experiments. We found that building our understanding into a novel analysis tool (CRISPAltRations) improved results quality. We validated our software using simulated rhAmpSeq amplicon sequencing data (11 gRNAs and 603 on- and off-target locations) and demonstrate that CRISPAltRations outperforms other publicly available software tools in accurately annotating CRISPR-associated indels and homology directed repair (HDR) events. We enable non-bioinformaticians to use CRISPAltRations by developing a web-accessible, cloud-hosted deployment, which allows rapid batch processing of samples in a graphical user-interface (GUI) and complies with HIPAA security standards. By ensuring that our software is thoroughly tested, version controlled, and supported with a UI we enable resequencing analysis of CRISPR genome editing experiments to researchers no matter their skill in bioinformatics.",

    "abstract": "Electronic cigarettes (ECs) have been linked to lung diseases, including COVID-19, with little understanding of exposure, retention, and exhalation of EC aerosol chemicals. Here, flavor chemicals and nicotine were quantified in two refill fluids, their transfer efficiency to EC aerosols was determined, exhalation by human participants was measured, and chemical retention was modeled. Nicotine transferred well to aerosols irrespective of topography; however, transfer efficiencies of flavor chemicals depended on the chemical, puff volume, puff duration, pump head, and EC power. Participants could be classified as \"mouth inhalers\" or \"lung inhalers\" based on their retention and exhale of flavor chemicals and nicotine. Only mouth inhalers exhaled sufficient concentrations of flavor chemicals and nicotine to contribute to chemical deposition on environmental surfaces. These data help distinguish two types of EC users, add to our knowledge of chemical exposure during vaping, and provide information useful in treating EC-related diseases and regulating EC use.",

    "abstract": "The thermal stability of proteins can be altered when they interact with small molecules, other biomolecules or are subject to post-translation modifications. Thus monitoring the thermal stability of proteins under various cellular perturbations can provide insights into protein function, as well as potentially determine drug targets and off-targets. Thermal proteome profiling is a highly multiplexed mass-spectrommetry method for monitoring the melting behaviour of thousands of proteins in a single experiment. In essence, thermal proteome profiling assumes that proteins denature upon heating and hence become insoluble. Thus, by tracking the relative solubility of proteins at sequentially increasing temperatures, one can report on the thermal stability of a protein. Standard thermodynamics predicts a sigmoidal relationship between temperature and relative solubility and this is the basis of current robust statistical procedures. However, current methods do not model deviations from this behaviour and they do not quantify uncertainty in the melting profiles. To overcome these challenges, we propose the application of Bayesian functional data analysis tools which allow complex temperature-solubility behaviours. Our methods have improved sensitivity over the state-of-the art, identify new drug-protein associations and have less restrictive assumptions than current approaches. Our methods allows for comprehensive analysis of proteins that deviate from the predicted sigmoid behaviour and we uncover potentially biphasic phenomena with a series of published datasets.",

    "abstract": "Adult C. elegans hermaphrodites exhibit severe senescent pathology that begins to develop within days of reaching sexual maturity (Ezcurra et al., 2018; Garigan et al., 2002; Herndon et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2018). For example, after depletion of self-sperm, intestinal biomass is converted into yolk leading to intestinal atrophy and yolk steatosis (pseudocoelomic lipoprotein pools, PLPs) (Ezcurra et al., 2018; Garigan et al., 2002; Herndon et al., 2002; Sornda et al., 2019). These senescent pathologies are promoted by insulin/IGF-1 signalling (IIS), which also shortens lifespan (Ezcurra et al., 2018; Kenyon, 2010). This pattern of rapid and severe pathology in organs linked to reproduction is reminiscent of semelparous organisms where massive reproductive effort leads to rapid death (reproductive death) as in Pacific salmon (Finch, 1990; Gems et al., 2020). Moreover, destructive conversion of somatic biomass to support reproduction is a hallmark of reproductive death (Gems et al., 2020). Yet arguing against the occurrence of reproductive death in C. elegans is the apparent futility of post-reproductive yolk production. Here we show that this effort is not futile, since post-reproductive mothers vent yolk through their vulva, which is consumed by progeny and supports their growth; thus vented yolk functions as a milk, and C. elegans mothers exhibit a form of lactation. Moreover, IIS promotes lactation, thereby effecting a costly process of resource transfer from postreproductive mothers to offspring. These results support the view that C. elegans hermaphrodites exhibit reproductive death involving a self-destructive process of lactation that is promoted by IIS. They also provide new insight into how the strongly life-shortening effects of IIS in C. elegans evolved.",

    "abstract": "O_LITrue color vision in animals is achieved when wavelength discrimination occurs based on chromatic content of the stimuli, regardless of intensity. In order to successfully discriminate between multiple wavelengths, animals must use at least two photoreceptor types with different spectral sensitivity peaks.\nC_LIO_LIHeliconius butterflies have duplicate UV opsin genes, which encode two kinds of photoreceptors with peak sensitivities in the ultraviolet and violet, respectively. In H. erato, the ultraviolet photoreceptor is only expressed in females.\nC_LIO_LIEvidence from intracellular recordings suggests female H. erato may be able to discriminate between UV wavelengths, however, this has yet to be tested experimentally.\nC_LIO_LIUsing an arena with a controlled light setting, we tested the ability of H. erato, and two species lacking the violet receptor, H. melpomene and outgroup Eueides isabella, to discriminate between two ultraviolet wavelengths, 380 and 390 nm, as well as two blue wavelengths, 400 and 436 nm, after being trained to associate each stimulus with a food reward. Wavelength stimuli were presented in varying intensities to rule out brightness as a cue.\nC_LIO_LIWe found that H. erato females were the only butterflies capable of color vision in the UV range; the other butterflies had an intensity-dependent preference for UV stimuli. Across species, both sexes showed color vision in the blue-range.\nC_LIO_LIModels of H. erato color vision suggest that females have an advantage over males in discriminating the inner UV-yellow corolla of Psiguria pollen flowers from the surrounding outer orange petals, while previous models (McCulloch et al. 2017) suggested that H. erato males have an advantage over females in discriminating Heliconius 3-hyroxykynurenine (3-OHK) yellow wing coloration from non-3-OHK yellow wing coloration found in mimics.\nC_LIO_LIThese results provide some of the first behavioral evidence for UV color discrimination in Heliconius females in the context of foraging, lending support to the hypothesis (Briscoe et al. 2010) that the duplicated UV opsin genes function together in UV color vision. Taken together, the sexually dimorphic visual system of H. erato appears to have been shaped by both sexual selection and sex-specific natural selection.\nC_LI",
