    "abstract": "OmicPioneer-sc is an open-source data visualization/analysis package that integrates dimensionality-reduction plots (DRPs) such as t-SNE and UMAP with Next-Generation Clustered Heat Maps (NGCHMs) and Pathway Visualization Modules (PVMs) in a seamless, highly interactive exploratory environment. It includes fluent zooming and navigation, a statistical toolkit, dozens of link-outs to external public bioinformatic resources, high-resolution graphics that meet the requirements of all major journals, and the ability to store all metadata needed to reproduce the visualizations at a later time. A user-friendly, multi-panel graphical interface enables non-informaticians to interact with the system without programming, asking and answering questions that require navigation among the three types of modules or extension from them to the Gene Ontology or information on therapies. The visual integration can be useful for detective work to identify and annotate cell-types for color-coding of the DRPs, and multiple NGCHMs can be layered on top of each other (with toggling among them) as an aid to multi-omic analysis. The tools are available in containerized form with APIs to facilitate incorporation as a plug-in to other bioinformatic environments. The capabilities of OmicPioneer-sc are illustrated here through application to a single-cell RNA-seq airway dataset pertinent to the biology of both cancer and COVID-19.\n\n[Supplemental material is available for this article.]",

    "abstract": "Bacteria grow on surfaces in complex immobile communities known as biofilms, which are composed of cells embedded in an extracellular matrix. Within biofilms, bacteria often interact with members of their own species, and cooperate or compete with members of other species via quorum sensing (QS). QS is a process by which microbes produce, secrete, and subsequently detect small molecules called autoinducers (AIs) to assess their local population density. We explore the competitive advantage of QS through agent-based simulations of a spatial model in which colony expansion via extracellular matrix production provides greater access to a limiting diffusible nutrient. We note a significant difference in results based on whether AI production is constitutive or limited by nutrient availability: If AI production is constitutive, simple QS-based matrix-production strategies can be far superior to any fixed strategy. However, if AI production is limited by nutrient availability, QS-based strategies fail to provide a significant advantage over fixed strategies. To explain this dichotomy, we derive a novel biophysical limit for the dynamic range of nutrient-limited AI concentrations in biofilms. This range is remarkably small (less than 10-fold) for the realistic case in which a growth-limiting diffusible nutrient is taken up within a narrow active growth layer. This biophysical limit implies that for QS to be most effective in biofilms, AI production should be a protected function not directly tied to metabolism.\n\nSignificance StatementBiofilms are a ubiquitous form of bacterial community. Within biofilms, bacteria communicate via chemical signals in a process called quorum sensing (QS). However, if signal production is nutrient-limited, then the nutrient-deficient interior of a biofilm cannot contribute to QS, which limits the ability of bacteria to assess their own population and behave accordingly. Numerical simulations of competitions among biofilm bacteria led us to discover a novel biophysical limit on the efficacy of nutrient-limited QS. In view of this limit, we conclude that to be most effective, QS signal production should be a prized function that is not metabolically slaved.",

    "abstract": "Electrical and paracrine couplings between cardiomyocytes (CMs) and myofibroblasts (MFBs) affect both physiology and pathophysiology of cardiac tissues in a range of animal models, but relating these observations to humans is a challenge because effects vary greatly across species. To address this challenge, we developed a mathematical model for mechanoelectrical interactions between CM and MFB, considering both electrical and paracrine couplings between CMs and MFBs, with the aim of identifying the sources of cross-species variation and extrapolating animal models to predicted effects in humans. Our results revealed substantial differences across species in how these couplings modulate excitation-contraction coupling and Ca2+ transients of CMs. Both classes of couplings prolong action potential and increase APD in rat CMs, but shorten action potential and decrease APD in human CMs. Electrical coupling attenuates Ca2+ transients and active tension generation in human CMs, but has no significant effect on rat CMs. Paracrine coupling reduces Ca2+ transients and active tension in both human and rat CM. The results suggest that the variance of functional interactions between CM and MFB in cross-species may be explained by differences in the transient outward K+ currents associated with the KCND2 gene, and thus suggest potential therapeutic pathways for fibrotic cardiomyopathy.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has disrupted modern societies and their economies. The resurgence in COVID-19 cases as part of the second wave is observed across Europe and the Americas. The scientific response has enabled a complete structural characterization of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among the most relevant proteins required by the novel coronavirus to facilitate the cell entry mechanism is the spike protein trimer. This protein possesses a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then triggers the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. In this regard, a comprehensive characterization of the structural stability of the spike protein is a crucial step to find new therapeutics to interrupt the process of recognition. On the other hand, it has been suggested the participation of more than one RBD as a possible mechanism to enhance cell entry. Here we discuss the protein structural stability based on the computational determination of the dynamic contact map and the energetic difference of the spike protein conformations via the mapping of the hydration free energy by the Poisson-Boltzmann method. We expect our result to foster the discussion of the number of RBD involved during recognition and the repurposing of new drugs to disable the recognition by discovering new hotspots for drug targets apart from the flexible loop in the RBD that binds the ACE2.",

    "abstract": "Recent genomic and scRNA-seq analyses of melanoma identified common transcriptional states correlating with invasion or drug resistance, but failed to find recurrent drivers of metastasis. To test whether transcriptional adaptation can drive melanoma progression, we made use of a zebrafish mitfa:BRAFV600E;tp53-/- model, in which malignant progression is characterized by minimal genetic evolution. We undertook an overexpression-screen of 80 epigenetic/transcriptional regulators and found neural crest-mesenchyme developmental regulator SATB2 to accelerate aggressive melanoma development. Its overexpression induces invadopodia formation and invasion in zebrafish tumors and human melanoma cell lines. SATB2 binds and activates neural crest-regulators, including pdgfab and snai2. The transcriptional program induced by SATB2 overlaps with known MITFlowAXLhlgh and AQP1+NGFR1high drug resistant states and functionally drives enhanced tumor propagation and resistance to Vemurafenib in vivo. Here we show that melanoma transcriptional rewiring by SATB2 to a neural crest mesenchyme-like program can drive invasion and drug resistance in endogenous tumors.",

    "abstract": "Clinical trial simulation (CTS) is a valuable tool in drug development. To obtain realistic scenarios, the subjects included in the CTS must be representative of the target population. Common ways of generating virtual subjects are based upon bootstrap (BS) procedures or multivariate normal distributions (MVND). Here, we investigated the performance of an alternative method based on conditional distributions (CD). Covariates data from a hypertension drug development program were used. The methods were evaluated based on the original dataset (internal evaluation) and on their ability to reproduce an older, unobserved population (extrapolation). Similar results were obtained in the internal evaluation for summary statistics, yet BS was able to preserve the correlation structure of the empirical distribution, which was not adequately reproduced by MVND; CD was in between BS and MVND. BS does not allow to extrapolate to an unobserved population. When the dataset used to inform the extrapolation was well approximated by a MVND, the results from CD and MVND were comparable. However, improved extrapolation performance was observed for CD when deviations from normality assumptions occurred. If CTS is used to simulate within the observed distribution, BS is the preferred method. When extrapolating to new populations, a parametric method like CD/MVND is needed. In case the empirical multivariate distribution is characterized by linearly related covariates and unimodal marginal distributions, MVND can be used because of the simpler statistical framework and well-established use; however, if uncertainty about the MVND assumptions exists, CD will increase the confidence in the simulations compared to MVND.",

    "abstract": "Existing mutagenicity tests for metazoans lack the direct observation of enhanced germline mutation rates after exposure to anthropogenic substances, therefore being inefficient. Cadmium (Cd) is a metal described as a mutagen in mammalian cells and listed as a group 1 carcinogenic and mutagenic substance. But Cd mutagenesis mechanism is not yet clear. Therefore, in the present study, we propose a method coupling short-term mutation accumulation (MA) lines with subsequent whole genome sequencing (WGS) and a dedicated data analysis pipeline to investigate if chronic Cd exposure on Chironomus riparius can alter the rate at which de novo point mutations appear. Results show that Cd exposure did not affect the basal germline mutation rate nor the mutational spectrum in C. riparius, thereby arguing that exposed organisms might experience a range of other toxic effects before any mutagenic effect may occur. We show that it is possible to establish a practical and easily implemented pipeline to rapidly detect germ cell mutagens in a metazoan test organism. Furthermore, our data implicate that it is questionable to transfer mutagenicity assessments based on in vitro methods to complex metazoans.\n\nMain find of the workCd chronic exposure under environmental realistic concentrations did not exert mutagenicity; It is questionable to transfer in vitro mutagenicity assessments to complex metazoans.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic {beta}-cells release insulin upon a rise in blood glucose. The precise mechanisms of stimulus-secretion coupling, and its failure in Diabetes Mellitus Type 2, remain to be elucidated. The consensus model, as well as a class of currently prescribed anti-diabetic drugs, are based around the observation that glucose-evoked ATP production in {beta}-cells leads to closure of cell membrane ATP-gated potassium (KATP) channels, plasma membrane depolarisation, Ca2+ influx, and finally the exocytosis of insulin granules (Ashcroft et al., 1984; Cook and Hales, 1984). However, it has been demonstrated by the inactivation of this pathway using genetic and pharmacological means that closure of the KATP channel alone may not be sufficient to explain all {beta}-cell responses to glucose elevation (Henquin, 1998; Seghers et al., 2000). Here we show using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (Axelrod, 1981) that glucose as well as the Ca2+ mobilising messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), known to operate in {beta}-cells (Johnson and Misler, 2002; Masgrau et al., 2003), lead to highly localised elementary intracellular Ca2+ signals. These were found to be obscured by measurements of global Ca2+ signals and the action of powerful SERCA-based sequestration mechanisms at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This is the first demonstration of elemental Ca2+ signals in response to NAADP, although they have been suspected (Davis et al., 2020). Optical quantal analysis of these events reveals a unitary event amplitude equivalent to that of known elementary Ca2+ signalling events, inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor mediated blips (Parker et al., 1996; Parker and Ivorra, 1990), and ryanodine receptor mediated sparks (Cheng et al., 1993). We propose that a mechanism based on these highly localised intracellular Ca2+ signalling events mediated by NAADP may initially operate in {beta}-cells when they respond to elevations in blood glucose.",

The exposure of plants to Cd or Cu decreased plant growth and increased Cd and Cu concentration in their shoots and roots. External Cd or Cu in the soil increased the uptake of both elements. Regression analysis showed that the weight of both shoots and roots decreased linearly with the increase of Cu and Cd contents in roots and shoots. Results showed that Cd was more toxic than Cu. The water content of shoots and roots decreased linearly with increased heavy metal levels. P. farcta could take up Cu and Cd in both Cu- and Cd-contaminated soils, however, it was more capable for transporting Cd from roots to shoots rather than Cu.

    "abstract": "In cultivated tetraploid potato, reduction to diploidy (dihaploidy) allows hybridization to diploid germplasm, introgression breeding, and may facilitate the production of inbreds. Pollination with haploid inducers yields maternal dihaploids, as well as triploid and tetraploid hybrids. It is not known if dihaploids result from parthenogenesis, entailing development of embryos from unfertilized eggs, or genome elimination, entailing missegregation and loss of paternal chromosomes. A sign of genome elimination is the occasional persistence of haploid inducer DNA in some of the dihaploids. We characterized the genomes of 1,001 putative dihaploids and 134 hybrids produced by pollinating tetraploid clones with three haploid inducers, IVP35, IVP101, and PL4. We detected inheritance of full or partial chromosomes from the haploid inducer parent in 0.87% of the overall dihaploid progeny, irrespective of the combination of parental genotypes. Chromosomal breaks commonly affected the paternal genome in the dihaploid and tetraploid progeny, but not in the triploid progeny. Residual haploid inducer DNA is consistent with genome elimination as the mechanism of haploid induction. Further, the fact that paternal chromosome breaks are specific to dihaploids and tetraploid progeny suggests that they may be specific to 2x sperms, and supports the hypothesis that 2x sperms facilitate genome elimination.",

Applying the observation data from the monitoring network, MINCERnet, to the canopy heat balance model, IM2PACT, it was quantitatively corroborated in open-field conditions worldwide that the canopy and panicle transpiration and their evaporative cooling effect played a great role on the micrometeorological gap between the ambient air temperature and the panicle temperature, and that the sterility rate due to HISS in open-fields can be evaluated accurately in diverse climates by the mean panicle temperature at flowering hours in the flowering period. The heat balance structure suggested that the risk of HISS should be higher in high humidity climates rather than in dry climates also in the future, which lead to the importance of the humidity accuracy as well as of the air temperature in climate scenarios and their spatial downscaling for future prediction of rice heat stress and production. Applying the heat-tolerant variety was suggested to be able to keep the sterility due to HISS low in all climates. It is needed of the approach using the panicle temperature as indicator of HISS by intervening sub-model and/or monitoring of micrometeorology inside the canopy to reduce uncertainties in future rice yield prediction under various adaptation measures.",

    "abstract": "Root metaxylem are phenotypically diverse structures whose function is related to their anatomy, particularly under drought stress. Much research has dissected the genetic machinery underlying metaxylem phenotypes in dicots, but monocots are relatively unexplored. In maize (Zea mays), a robust pipeline integrated a GWAS of root metaxylem phenes under well-watered and water stress conditions with a gene co-expression network to identify candidate genes most likely to impact metaxylem phenotypes. We identified several promising candidate genes in 14 gene co-expression modules inferred to be functionally relevant to xylem development. We also identified five gene candidates that co-localized in multiple root metaxylem phenes in both well-watered and water stress conditions. Using a rice GWAS conducted in parallel, we detected overlapping genetic architecture influencing root metaxylem phenotypes by identifying eight pairs of syntenic candidate genes significantly associated with metaxylem phenes. There is evidence that the genes of these syntenic pairs may be involved in biosynthetic processes related to the cell wall, hormone signaling, oxidative stress responses, and drought responses. Our study demonstrates a powerful new strategy for identifying promising gene candidates and suggests several gene candidates that may enhance our understanding of vascular development and responses to drought in cereals.\n\nOne sentence summaryCross-species genome-wide association studies and a gene coexpression network identified genes associated with root metaxylem phenotypes in maize under water stress and non-stress and rice.",

    "abstract": "The light-induced reorientation of the cortical microtubule array in dark-grown A. thaliana hypocotyl cells is a striking example of the dynamical plasticity of the microtubule cytoskeleton. A consensus model, based on katanin-mediated severing at microtubule crossovers, has been developed that successfully describes the onset of the observed switch between a transverse and longitudinal array orientation. However, we currently lack an understanding of why the newly-populated longitudinal array direction remains stable for longer times and re-equilibration effects would tend to drive the system back to a mixed orientation state. Using both simulations and analytical calculations, we show that the assumption of a small orientation-dependent shift in microtubule dynamics is sufficient to explain the long term lock-in of the longitudinal array orientation. Furthermore, we show that the natural alternative hypothesis that there is a selective advantage in severing longitudinal microtubules, is neither necessary nor sufficient to achieve cortical array reorientation, but is able to accelerate this process significantly.",

We show that when present separately, synaptotagmin-1 and synaptotagmin-7 act as standalone fast and slow Ca2+-sensors for vesicle fusion in mouse chromaffin cells. When present together, synaptotagmin-7 stimulates Ca2+-dependent vesicle priming and inhibits depriming. The priming effect of Synaptotagmin-7 extends to the Readily Releasable Pool, whose fusion is executed by synaptotagmin-1, indicating synergistic action of the two Ca2+-sensors, although they are only partially colocalized. Synaptotagmin-7 promotes ubMunc13-2-dependent priming and the absence of synaptotagmin-7 renders phorbolesters less effective in stimulating priming, although synaptotagmin-7 independent priming is also observed. Morphologically, synaptotagmin-7 places vesicles in close membrane apposition (< 6 nm); in its absence vesicles accumulate out of reach of the fusion complex (20-40 nm). We suggest that a synaptotagmin-7-dependent movement toward the membrane is involved in Munc13-2/phorbolester/Ca2+-dependent priming and sets the stage for fast and slow exocytosis triggering.",

We hypothesized that hormones, might affect the large-scale organization of the brain functional networks and that, in turn, such changes might have behavioural correlates in terms of the affective state. To test our hypothesis, we took advantage of magnetoencephalography to investigate brain topology in early follicular, ovulatory and luteal phases, in twenty-four naturally-cycling women without signs of anxiety and/or depression. We show that in the alpha band the betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (PCG) during the ovulatory phase is increased and the rise is predicted by the levels of estradiol. We also demonstrate that the increase in the BC is related to improved subjective well-being that, in turn, is correlated to the estradiol levels. The increased topological centrality of the PCG during the ovulatory phase could have implications in reproductive psychology.",

    "abstract": "Smooth pursuit eye movements and visual motion perception rely on the integration of current sensory signals with past experience. Experience shapes our expectation of current visual events and can drive eye movement responses made in anticipation of a target, such as anticipatory pursuit. Previous research revealed consistent effects of expectation on anticipatory pursuit--eye movements follow the expected target direction or speed--and contrasting effects on motion perception, but most studies considered either eye movement or perceptual responses. The current study directly compared effects of direction expectation on perception and anticipatory pursuit within the same direction discrimination task to investigate whether both types of responses are affected similarly or differently. Observers (n = 10) viewed high-coherence random-dot kinematograms (RDKs) moving rightward and leftward with a probability of 50, 70, or 90% in a given block of trials to build up an expectation of motion direction. They were asked to judge motion direction of interleaved low-coherence RDKs (0-15%). Perceptual judgements were compared to changes in anticipatory pursuit eye movements as a function of probability. Results show that anticipatory pursuit velocity scaled with probability and followed direction expectation (attraction bias), whereas perceptual judgments were biased opposite to direction expectation (repulsion bias). Control experiments suggest that the repulsion bias in perception was not caused by retinal slip induced by anticipatory pursuit, or by motion adaptation. We conclude that direction expectation can be processed differently for perception and anticipatory pursuit.",

Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we detected FLiCRE transcripts among the endogenous transcriptome, providing simultaneous readout of both cell-type and calcium activation history. We identified a cell-type in the nucleus accumbens activated downstream of long-range excitatory projections. Taking advantage of FLiCREs modular design, we expressed an optogenetic channel selectively in this cell-type, and showed that direct recruitment of this otherwise genetically-inaccessible population elicits behavioral aversion.

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous adoption of linearity for quantitative explanatory variables in statistical modeling is likely attributable to its advantages of straightforward interpretation and computational feasibility. The linearity assumption may be a reasonable approximation especially when the variable is confined within a narrow range, but it can be problematic when the variables effect is non-monotonic or complex. Furthermore, visualization and model assessment of a linear fit are usually omitted because of challenges at the whole brain level in neuroimaging. By adopting a principle of learning from the data in the presence of uncertainty to resolve the problematic aspects of conventional polynomial fitting, we introduce a flexible and adaptive approach of multilevel smoothing splines (MSS) to capture any nonlinearity of a quantitative explanatory variable for population-level neuroimaging data analysis. With no prior knowledge regarding the underlying relationship other than a parsimonious assumption about the extent of smoothness (e.g., no sharp corners), we express the unknown relationship with a sufficient number of smoothing splines and use the data to adaptively determine the specifics of the nonlinearity. In addition to introducing the theoretical framework of MSS as an efficient approach with a counterbalance between flexibility and stability, we strive to (a) lay out the specific schemes for population-level nonlinear analyses that may involve task (e.g., contrasting conditions) and subject-grouping (e.g., patients vs controls) factors; (b) provide modeling accommodations to adaptively reveal, estimate and compare any nonlinear effects of an explanatory variable across the brain, or to more accurately account for the effects (including nonlinear effects) of a quantitative confound; (c) offer the associated program 3dMSS to the neuroimaging community for whole-brain voxel-wise analysis as part of the AFNI suite; and (d) demonstrate the modeling approach and visualization processes with a longitudinal dataset of structural MRI scans.",

    "abstract": "In conventional flowcytometry one detector (primary) is dedicated for one fluorochrome. However, photons usually end up in other detectors too (fluorescence spillover).  Compensation is a process that corrects the spillover signal from all detectors except the primary detector. Post  compensation, the photon counting error of spillover signals become evident as spreading of the data. The spreading induced by spillover impairs the ability to resolve stained cell population from the unstained one, potentially reducing or completely losing cell populations. For successful multi-color panel design, it is important to know the expected spillover to maximize the data resolution. The Spillover Spreading Matrix (SSM) can be used to estimate the spread, but the outcome is dependent on detector sensitivity. Simply, the same single stained sample produces different spillover spread values when detector(s) sensitivity is altered. Many researchers mistakenly use this artifact to \"reduce\" the spread by decreasing detector sensitivity. This can result in diminished capacity to resolve dimly expressing cell populations. Here, we introduce SQI (Spread Quantification Index), that can quantify the spillover spread independent of detector sensitivity and independent of dynamic range. This allows users to compare spillover spread between instruments having different types of detectors, which is not possible using SSM.",

However, there is concern that immune responses following natural infection may not be sustained and that this may predispose to recurrent infection. We analysed the magnitude and phenotype of the SARS-CoV-2 cellular immune response in 100 donors at six months following primary infection and related this to the profile of antibody level against spike, nucleoprotein and RBD over the previous six months. T-cell immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 were present by ELISPOT and/or ICS analysis in all donors and are characterised by predominant CD4+ T cell responses with strong IL-2 cytokine expression. Median T-cell responses were 50% higher in donors who had experienced an initial symptomatic infection indicating that the severity of primary infection establishes a  setpoint for cellular immunity that lasts for at least 6 months. The T-cell responses to both spike and nucleoprotein/membrane proteins were strongly correlated with the peak antibody level against each protein. The rate of decline in antibody level varied between individuals and higher levels of nucleoprotein-specific T cells were associated with preservation of NP-specific antibody level although no such correlation was observed in relation to spike-specific responses. In conclusion, our data are reassuring that functional SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses are retained at six months following infection although the magnitude of this response is related to the clinical features of primary infection.",

    "abstract": "Small-scale farming of meat chicken flocks using local native breeds contributes to the economy of many rural livelihoods in Vietnam and many other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). These systems are also the target of high levels of antimicrobial use (AMU); however little is known about the profitability and sustainability of such systems. Since small scale farms are commercial enterprises, this knowledge is essential in order to develop successful strategies aimed at curbing excessive AMU. Using longitudinal data from 203 randomly selected small-scale (100-2,000 chickens) native chicken flocks raised in 102 farms in Dong Thap province (Mekong Delta, Vietnam), we investigated the financial and economic parameters of such systems and the main constraints to their sustainability. Feed accounted for the largest financial cost (flock median 49.5% [Inter-quartile range (IQR) 41.5-61.8%]) of total costs, followed by day-old-chicks (DOCs) (median 30.3% [IQR 23.2-38.4%]), non-antimicrobial health-supporting products (median 7.1% [IQR 4.7-10.5%]), vaccines (median 3.1% [IQR 2.2-4.8%]), equipment (median 1.9% [IQR 0.0-4.9%]) and antimicrobials (median 1.9% [IQR 0.7-3.6%]). Excluding labor costs, farmers achieved a positive return on investment (ROI) from 120 (59.1%) flocks, the remainder generated a loss (median ROI 124% [IQR 36-206%]). Higher ROI was associated with higher flock size and low mortality. There was no statistical association between use of medicated feed and flock mortality or chicken bodyweight. The median daily income per person dedicated to raising chickens was 202,100 VND, lower than alternative rural labour activities in the Mekong Delta. In a large proportion of farms (33.4%), farmers decided to stop raising chickens after completing one cycle. Farmers who dropped off chicken production purchased more expensive feed (in 1,000 VND per kg) (11.1 [10.6-11.5] vs. 10.8 [10.4-11.3] for farms that continued production (p=0.039) and experienced higher chicken mortality (28.5% [12.0-79.0%] vs. 16 [7.5-33.0%] (p=0.004). The turnover of farmers raising chickens in such systems represents a challenge in targeting messages on appropriate AMU and on chicken health. In order to ensure sustainability of small-scale commercial systems, advisory services need to be available as farmer initiate new flocks, and support them in the early stages to help overcome their limited experience and skills. This targeted approach would support profitability whilst reducing risk of emergence of AMR and other disease problems from these systems.",

    "abstract": "Bdellovibrionota is composed of obligate predators that can consume some gram-negative bacteria inhabiting various environments. However, whether genomic traits influence their distribution and marine adaptation remains to be answered. In this study, we performed phylogenomics and comparative genomics studies on 82 Bdellovibrionota genomes along with five metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from deep sea zones. Four phylogenetic groups, Oligoflexia, Bdello-group1, Bdello-group2 and Bacteriovoracia, were revealed by constructing a phylogenetic tree, of which 53.84% of Bdello-group2 and 48.94% of Bacteriovoracia were derived from ocean. Bacteriovoracia was more prevalent in deep sea zones, whereas Bdello-group2 was largely distributed in the epipelagic zone. Metabolic reconstruction indicated that genes involved in chemotaxis, flagellar (mobility), type II secretion system, ABC transporters and penicillin-binding protein were necessary for predatory lifestyle of Bdellovibrionota. Genes involved in glycerol metabolism, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) degradation, cell wall recycling and peptide utilization were ubiquitously present in Bdellovibrionota genomes. Comparative genomics between marine and non-marine Bdellovibrionota demonstrated that betaine as an osmoprotectant is probably widely used by marine Bdellovibrionota, meanwhile, all the marine genomes have a number of related genes for adapting marine environment. The chitinase and chitin-binding protein encoding genes were identified for the first time in Oligoflexia, which implied that Oligoflexia may prey a wider spectrum of microbes. This study expanded our knowledge on adaption strategies of Bdellovibrionota inhabiting deep sea and their potential usage for biological control.\n\nImportanceBdellovibrionota can prey gram-negative bacteria proposed as biocontrol agent. Available Bdellovibrionota genomes showed that most are from marine environment. However, vertical distribution and adaption of Bdellovibrionota in deep sea has not been reported. Our study of Bdellovibrionota revealed four groups (Oligoflexia, Bdello-group1, Bdello-group2 and Bacteriovoracia) and their distribution pattern in oceans. We also identified the genes for different phases of predation and adaptation in deep-sea environment. Moreover, Oligoflexia genomes contain more genes for carbohydrates utilization and particularly those encoding chitin-binding protein and chitinase. Our analyses of Bdellovibrionota genomes may help understand their special lifestyle and deep-sea adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a state of irreversible cell proliferation arrest induced by various stressors including telomere attrition, DNA damage and oncogene induction. While beneficial as an acute response to stress, accumulation of senescent cells with increasing age is through to contribute adversely to development of cancer and a number of other age-related diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases for which there are currently no effective disease-modifying therapies. Non-cell autonomous effects of senescent cells have been suggested to arise through the SASP, a wide variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and exosomes secreted by senescent cells. Here, we report an additional means of cell communication utilised by senescent cells via large numbers of membrane-bound intercellular bridges - or tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs) - containing the cytoskeletal components actin and tubulin, and which form direct physical connections between cells. We observe the presence of mitochondria in these TNTs, and show organelle transfer through the TNTs to adjacent cells. While transport of individual mitochondria along single TNTs appears unidirectional, we show by differentially labelled co-culture experiments that organelle transfer through TNTs can occur both between different cells within senescent cell populations, and also between senescent and proliferating cells. Using small molecule inhibitors, we demonstrate that senescent cell TNTs are dependent on signalling through the mTOR pathway, which we further show is mediated at least in part through downstream actin-cytoskeleton regulatory factor Cdc42. These findings have significant implications for development of senomodifying therapies, as they highlight the need to account for local direct cell-cell contacts as well as the SASP in order to treat cancer and diseases of ageing in which senescence is a key factor.",

    "abstract": "Study questionCan label-free, non-invasive optical imaging by hyperspectral microscopy discern between euploid and aneuploid cells within the inner cell mass of the mouse preimplantation embryo?\n\nSummary answerHyperspectral microscopy shows a variance in metabolic activity which enables discrimination between euploid and aneuploid cells.\n\nWhat is known alreadyEuploid/aneuploid mosaicism affects up to 17.3% of human blastocyst embryos with trophectoderm biopsy or spent media currently utilised to diagnose aneuploidy and mosaicism in clinical in vitro fertilisation. Based on their design, these approaches will fail to diagnose the presence or proportion of aneuploid cells within the fetal lineage (inner cell mass (ICM)) of some blastocyst embryos.\n\nStudy design, size, durationThe impact of aneuploidy on cellular metabolism of primary human fibroblast cells and mouse embryos was assessed by a fluorescence microscope adapted for imaging with multiple spectral channels (hyperspectral imaging). Primary human fibroblast cells with known ploidy were subjected to hyperspectral imaging to record native cell fluorescence (euploid n= 467; aneuploid n= 969). For mouse embryos, 50-70 individual euploid and aneuploid blastomeres (8-cell stage embryo) and chimeric blastocysts (40-50 per group: euploid; aneuploid; or 1:1 and 1:3 ratio of euploid:aneuploid) were utilised for hyperspectral imaging.\n\nParticipants/materials, setting, methodsTwo models were employed: (i) Primary human fibroblasts with known karyotype and (ii) a mouse model of embryo aneuploidy where mouse embryos were treated with reversine, a reversible spindle assembly checkpoint inhibitor, during the 4-to 8-cell division. Individual blastomeres were dissociated from reversine treated (aneuploid) and control (euploid) 8-cell embryos and either imaged directly or used to generate chimeric blastocysts with differing ratios of euploid:aneuploid cells. Individual blastomeres and embryos were subjected to hyperspectral imaging. Changes in cellular metabolism were determined by quantification of metabolic cofactors (inferred from their autofluorescence signature): reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(P)H), flavins with the subsequent calculation of the optical redox ratio (ORR: Flavins/[NAD(P)H + Flavins]). Mathematical algorithms were applied to extract features from the autofluorescence signals of each cell/blastomere/inner cell mass to discriminate between euploid and aneuploid.\n\nMain results and the role of chanceAn increase in the relative abundance of NAD(P)H with a decrease in flavins led to a significant reduction in the ORR for aneuploid cells in both primary human fibroblasts and individual mouse blastomeres (P < 0.05). Mathematical algorithms were able to achieve good separation between (i) euploid and aneuploid primary human fibroblast cells, (ii) euploid and aneuploid mouse blastomeres cells and (iii) euploid and aneuploid chimeric blastocysts and (iv) 1:1 and 1:3 chimeric blastocysts. The accuracy of these separations was supported by receiver operating characteristic curves with areas under the curve of 0.85, 0.99, 0.87 and 0.88, respectively. We believe that the role of chance is low as multiple cellular models (human somatic cells and mouse embryos) demonstrated a consistent shift in cellular metabolism in response to aneuploidy as well as the robust capacity of mathematical features to separate euploid and aneuploid cells in a statistically significant manner.\n\nLimitations, reasons for cautionThere would be added value in determining the degree of embryo mosaicism by sequencing the inner cell mass (ICM) of individual blastocysts to correlate with metabolic profile and level of discrimination achieved using the mathematical features approach.\n\nWider implications of the findingsHyperspectral imaging was able to discriminate between euploid and aneuploid human fibroblasts and mouse embryos. This may lead to the development of an accurate and non-invasive optical approach to assess mosaicism within the ICM of human embryos in the absence of fluorescent tags.\n\nStudy funding/competing interest(s)K.R.D. is supported by a Mid-Career Fellowship from the Hospital Research Foundation (C-MCF-58-2019).

    "abstract": "Inter-species comparisons of both morphology and gene expression within a phylum have revealed a period in the middle of embryogenesis with more similarity between species compared to earlier and later time-points. This  developmental hourglass pattern has been observed in many phyla, yet the evolutionary constraints on gene expression, and underlying mechanisms of how this is regulated, remains elusive. Moreover, the role of positive selection on gene regulation in the more diverged earlier and later stages of embryogenesis remains unknown. Here, using DNase-seq to identify regulatory regions in two distant Drosophila species (D. melanogaster and D. virilis), we assessed the evolutionary conservation and adaptive evolution of enhancers throughout multiple stages of embryogenesis. This revealed a higher proportion of conserved enhancers at the phylotypic period, providing a regulatory basis for the hourglass expression pattern. Using an in silico mutagenesis approach, we detect signatures of positive selection on developmental enhancers at early and late stages of embryogenesis, with a depletion at the phylotypic period, suggesting positive selection as one evolutionary mechanism underlying the hourglass pattern of animal evolution.",

    "abstract": "Many species that are extensively studied in the laboratory are less well characterized in their natural habitat, and laboratory strains represent only a small fraction of the variation in a species genome. Here we investigate genomic variation in three natural North American populations of an agricultural pest and a model insect for many scientific disciplines, the tobacco hornworm (Manduca sexta). We show that hornworms from Arizona, Kansas, and North Carolina are genetically distinct, with Arizona being particularly differentiated from the other two populations using Illumina whole-genome resequencing. Peaks of differentiation exist across the genome, but here we focus in on the most striking regions. In particular, we identify two likely segregating inversions found in the Arizona population. One inversion on the Z chromosome may enhance adaptive evolution of the sex chromosome. The larger, autosomal inversion contains a pseudogene may be involved in the exploitation of a novel hostplant in Arizona, but functional genetic assays will be required to support this hypothesis. Nevertheless, our results reveal undiscovered natural variation and provide useful genomic data for both pest management and evolutionary genetics of this insect species.",

    "abstract": "Cytidine base editors (CBE) are novel genome engineering tools that can generate C-to-T nucleotide substitutions without introducing double-stranded breaks (DSBs). Instead of generating single-point mutations, CBEs induce nucleotide substitutions at wobble positions within the 20-nucleotide target site. A variety of strategies have been developed to improve the targeting scope and window of CBEs. Among these strategies, molecular switches that can temporally control CBE activities represent compelling options. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using a bacteriophage-derived peptide, referred to as G8PPD, as the off-switch of CBEs. We showed that G8PPD could be employed to control the activities of and improve the targeting window of A3A and BE3 CBEs and adenine base editor 7.10 (ABE7.10). Notably, in a cell-based disease model of Marfan syndrome, G8PPD facilitated A3A CBE-based gene correction with a more focused targeting window and improved the percentage of perfectly edited gene alleles from less than 4% to more than 38% of the whole population. Our study presents the first peptide off-switch that can improve the targeting scope of CBEs, thus highlighting the importance of the temporal control of BE activity for precision base editing.",

Adipose TriGlyceride Lipase (ATGL) is the rate-limiting enzyme for lipolysis, and it preferentially hydrolyzes uFAs. Therefore, we hypothesized that ATGL-derived FAs may suppress the proteolytic activation of SREBP-1c in the liver. Here we show that (i) SREBP-1c is inactive during fasting but active after refeeding, (ii) uFA species liberated by ATGL suppress SREBP-1c activation in vitro, (iii) SREBP-1c is hyper-activated in livers of mice lacking ATGL, and (iv) pharmacological inhibition of ATGL selectively activates SREBP-1c in hepatocytes. Our findings highlight an ATGL/SREBP-1c axis, instrumental to coordinate lipogenesis and lipolysis, whose homeostatic regulation is crucial to avoid severe diseases including diabetes, cardiomyopathy, and even cancer.",

    "abstract": "Wilms tumour (WT), a childhood kidney cancer with embryonal origins, has been extensively characterised for genetic and epigenetic alterations, but a proportion of WTs still lack identifiable abnormalities. To uncover DNA methylation changes critical for WT pathogenesis, we compared the epigenome of fetal kidney with two WT cell lines, using methyl-CpG immunoprecipitation. We filtered our results to remove common cancer-associated epigenetic changes, and to enrich for genes involved in early kidney development. This identified four candidate genes that were hypermethylated in WT cell lines compared to fetal kidney, of which ESRP2 (epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2), was the most promising gene for further study. ESRP2 was commonly repressed by DNA methylation in WT, and this was shown to occur early in WT development (in nephrogenic rests). ESRP2 expression could be reactivated by DNA methyltransferase inhibition in WT cell lines. When ESRP2 was overexpressed in WT cell lines, it acted as an inhibitor of cellular proliferation in vitro, and in vivo it suppressed tumour growth of orthotopic xenografts in nude mice. RNA-seq of the ESRP2-expressing WT cell lines identified several novel splicing targets, in addition to well-characterised targets of ESRP2. We propose a model in which the mesenchymal to epithelial transition that is essential for early kidney development, can be disrupted in to generate WT, either by genetic abnormalities such as WT1 mutations, or by epigenetic defects, such as ESRP2 methylation.",

The objective of this study was to test the ivermectin drug in a murine model of coronavirus infection using a type 2 family RNA coronavirus similar to SARS-CoV2, the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). BALB/cJ female mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of MHV-A59 (Group Infected; n=20) and immediately treated with one single dose of 500 g/kg of ivermectin (Group Infected + IVM; n=20), or were not infected and treated with PBS (Control group; n=16). Five days after infection/treatment, mice were euthanized to obtain different tissues to check general health status and infection levels. Overall results demonstrated that viral infection induces the typical MHV disease in infected animals, with livers showing severe hepatocellular necrosis surrounded by a severe lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltration associated with a high hepatic viral load (52,158 AU), while ivermectin administration showed a better health status with lower viral load (23,192 AU; p<0.05) and few livers with histopathological damage (p<0.05), not showing statistical differences with control mice (P=NS). Furthermore, serum transaminase levels (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase) were significantly lower in treated mice compared to infected animals. In conclusion, ivermectin seems to be effective to diminish MHV viral load and disease in mice, being a useful model for further understanding new therapies against coronavirus diseases.",

In plants, enrichment of beneficial bacteria is associated with advantageous outcomes including protection from biotic and abiotic stress3,4. However, the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which plants enrich for specific beneficial microbes without general dysbiosis have remained elusive. Here we show that through regulation of NADPH oxidase, FERONIA kinase negatively regulates beneficial Pseudomonas fluorescens in the Arabidopsis rhizosphere microbiome. By rescreening a collection of Arabidopsis mutants that affect root immunity under gnotobiotic conditions, followed by microbiome sequencing in natural soil, we identified a FERONIA mutant (fer-8) with a rhizosphere microbiome enriched in P. fluorescens without phylum-level dysbiosis. Using microbiome transplant experiments, we found that the fer-8 microbiome was beneficial and promoted plant growth. The effect of FER on rhizosphere Pseudomonads was independent of its immune coreceptor function, role in development, and jasmonic acid autoimmunity. We found that the fer-8 mutant has reduced basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in roots and that mutants deficient in NADPH oxidase showed elevated rhizosphere Pseudomonad levels. Overexpression of the ROP2 gene (encoding a client of FER and positive regulator of NADPH oxidase5) in fer-8 plants suppressed Pseudomonad overgrowth. This work shows that FER-mediated ROS production regulates levels of beneficial Pseudomonads in the rhizosphere microbiome.",

A detailed quantitative analysis of these fluctuations using the Frequency-independent biological signal identification (FIBSI) program revealed that BDNF simultaneously depressed activity in some SDH neurons while it unmasked a particular subpopulation of  silent neurons causing them to become spontaneously active. Blockade of gap junctions disinhibited a subpopulation of SDH neurons and reduced BDNF-induced synchrony in BDNF-treated cultures. BDNF reduced neuronal excitability by measuring spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents. This was similar to the depressive effect of BDNF on the [Ca2+]i fluctuations.

    "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved, highly regulated catabolic process critical to neuronal homeostasis, function and survival throughout organismal lifespan. However, the external factors and signals that control autophagy in neurons are still poorly understood. Here we report that the G protein-coupled metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1) contributes to control basal autophagy in the brain. Autophagy is upregulated in the brain of adult mGlu1 knockout mice and genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of native mGlu1 receptors enhances autophagy flux in neurons. The evolutionarily conserved adaptor protein FEZ1, identified by a genome-wide screen as mGlu1 receptor interacting partner, was found to participate in the regulation of neuronal autophagy and to be required for repression of autophagy flux by the mGlu1 receptor. Furthermore, FEZ1 appears to enable association of mGlu1 with Ulk1, a core component of the autophagy pathway. Thus, we propose that the mGlu1 receptor contributes to restrain constitutive autophagy in neurons.",

    "abstract": "CD8 T cell memory differentiation endows T cells with an ability to rapidly induce effector functions upon pathogen re-encounter. While it is well established that substantial epigenetic remodeling occurs during the effector stage of the immune response, the signaling events that imprint CD8 T cells with these stable epigenetic programs are not well-defined. To gain insight into the signaling determinants of effector-associated epigenetic programming among CD8 T cells, we explored the role of IL-12 in the imprinting of IFNg expression during human CD8 T cell priming. We observed that TCR-mediated stimulation of human naive CD8 T cells is not sufficient to induce substantial demethylation of the IFNg promotor. However, TCR stimulation in the presence of the inflammatory cytokine, IL-12, resulted in significant and stable demethylation of the IFNg locus that was commensurate with an increase in IFNg expression. We further show that IL-12-associated demethylation of the IFNg locus is coupled to cell division through TET2-dependent passive demethylation in an ex vivo human CAR T cell model system and an in vivo immunologically competent murine system. Collectively, these data illustrate that IL-12 signaling promotes TET2-mediated effector epigenetic programming in CD8 T cells during the primary immune response and serve as proof of concept that signal 3 cytokines can be used to guide the induction of epigenetically regulated traits among T cells used for adoptive immunotherapies.",

Enrichment analyses of KEGG, Reactome and TRANSFAC databases complemented with genome-scale metabolic modelling revealed fibrotic signatures highly similar to liver pathologies in humans. The diverse genetic models of liver fibrosis exposed a common transcriptional programme with activated ER signalling, and a network of interactions between regulators of lipid metabolism and transcription factors from cancer pathways and immune system. The novel hallmarks of fibrosis are downregulated lipid pathways, including fatty acid, bile acid, and steroid hormone metabolism. Moreover, distinct metabolic subtypes of liver fibrosis were proposed, supported by unique enrichment of transcription factors based on the type of insult, disease stage, or sex.",

Here, we describe the potential use of a recombinase-based system to correct a 140 kb genomic inversion of the F8 gene, which is frequently found in patients diagnosed with severe Hemophilia A. Employing substrate-linked directed molecular evolution, we developed a fused heterodimeric recombinase system (RecF8) achieving 30% inversion of the target sequence in human tissue culture cells. Transient RecF8 treatment of endothelial cells, differentiated from patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of a hemophilic donor, resulted in prominent correction of the inversion and restored Factor VIII mRNA expression. Our data suggests that designer-recombinases may represent efficient and specific means towards treatment of monogenic diseases caused by large gene inversions.",

    "abstract": "Hepadnaviruses (family Hepadnaviviridae) are reverse-transcribing animal viruses that infect vertebrates. Vertebrate genomes contain DNA sequences derived from ancient hepadnaviruses, and these  endogenous hepatitis B viruses (eHBVs) reveal aspects of the long-term coevolutionary relationship between hepadnaviruses and their vertebrate hosts. Here, we use a novel, data-oriented approach to recover and analyse the complete repertoire of eHBV elements in published animal genomes. We show that germline incorporation of hepadnaviruses is exclusive to a single vertebrate group (Sauria) and that the eHBVs contained in saurian genomes represent a far greater diversity of hepadnaviruses than previously recognised. Through in-depth characterisation of eHBV elements we establish the existence of four distinct subgroups within the genus Avihepadnavirus and trace their evolution through the Cenozoic Era. Furthermore, we provide a completely new perspective on hepadnavirus evolution by showing that the metahepadnaviruses (genus Metahepadnavirus) originated >300 million years ago in the Paleozoic Era, and has historically infected a broad range of vertebrates. We also show that eHBVs have been intra-genomically amplified in some saurian lineages, and that eHBVs located at approximately equivalent genomic loci have been acquired in entirely distinct germline integration events. These findings indicate that selective forces have favoured the accumulation of hepadnaviral sequences at specific loci in the saurian germline. Our investigation provides a range of new insights into the long-term evolutionary history of reverse-transcribing DNA viruses and demonstrates that germline incorporation of hepadnaviruses has played an important role in shaping the evolution of saurian genomes.",

Concerted proton and electron transfers (CPETs) are used by the enzyme to rid the mitochondria of O2 *-, a precursor to other harmful reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The mechanisms of CPET-utilizing enzymes are typically unknown due to the difficulties in detecting the protonation states of specific residues and solvent molecules involved in catalysis while controlling the redox state of the enzyme. Here, neutron diffraction of redox-controlled MnSOD crystals revealed the all-atom structures of Mn3+SOD and Mn2+SOD delivering unique data on sites that change protonation state. A novel mechanism is proposed from the direct observation of glutamine deprotonation, the involvement of Tyr and His with altered pKas, and four unusual strong-short hydrogen bonds, including a low barrier hydrogen bond, that change with the oxidation state of the metal. Quantum calculations provide insight into the electronic modulation of the observed structures and the enzymatic mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Gap closure is a common morphogenetic process. In mammals, failure to close the embryonic hindbrain neuropore (HNP) gap causes fatal anencephaly. We observed that surface ectoderm cells surrounding the mouse HNP assemble high-tension actomyosin purse-strings at their leading edge and establish the initial contacts across the embryonic midline. The HNP gap closes asymmetrically, faster from its rostral than caudal extreme, while maintaining an elongated aspect ratio. Cell-based physical modelling identifies two closure mechanisms sufficient to describe tissue-level HNP closure dynamics; purse-string contraction and directional cell crawling. Combining both closure mechanisms hastens gap closure and produces a constant rate of gap shortening. Purse-string contraction reduces, whereas crawling increases gap aspect ratio, and their combination maintains it. Closure rate asymmetry can be explained by embryo tissue geometry, namely a narrower rostral gap apex. At the cellular level, our model predicts highly directional cell migration with a constant rate of cells leaving the HNP rim. These behaviours are reproducibly live-imaged in mouse embryos. Thus, mammalian embryos coordinate cellular and tissue-level mechanics to achieve this critical gap closure event.",

However, the regulation of histone acetylation and the maintenance of higher-order chromatin structure remains unidentified. Here, we investigated the effect of selective inhibition of HDAC6 by histone acetylation, chromatin relaxation assays, co-immunoprecipitation, acetylome peptide array and in vivo RNA microarray. Our data shows that nuclear HDAC6 physically interacts with the Histone 4 lysine 12 residue, and that HDAC6 inhibition increases acetylation specifically at this residue in several cancer types. Inhibition induces major chromatin structure modulation, but has no equivalent effect on knockout HDAC6-/- MEF cells. We identified several novel HDAC6-deacetylated substrates and high expression of HDAC6 in colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue association with reduced levels of H4K12ac and independent of the key CRC driver mutations, but positively associated with EGFR expression. Furthermore, in vivo HDAC6 inhibition induces significant tumor regression in a CRC xenograft mice model with significant changes in the expression of functional nuclear genes. We also demonstrated that a DNA damaging agent in combination with selective HDAC6 inhibition is effective and acts synergistically, inducing chromatin relaxation and increased cell death in CRC cells. CRC tissues (Normal versus tumor; n=58 matched pairs) together with TCGA data analysis of 467 CRC patients showed that high HDAC6 expression is associated with metastasis, overall and disease-free survival, and is an independent risk factor of CRC stage progression.

Various stresses globally suppress protein synthesis through the integrated stress response (ISR), resulting in preferential translation of the transcription factor ATF-4. Here we show in C. elegans that inhibition of translation or mTORC1 increases ATF-4 expression, and that ATF-4 mediates longevity under these conditions independently of ISR signalling. ATF-4 promotes longevity by activating canonical anti-ageing mechanisms, but also by elevating expression of the transsulfuration enzyme CTH-2 to increase hydrogen sulfide (H2S) production. This H2S boost increases protein persulfidation, a protective modification of redox-reactive cysteines. The ATF-4/CTH-2/H2S pathway also mediates longevity and increased stress resistance from mTORC1 suppression. Increasing H2S levels, or enhancing mechanisms that H2S influences through persulfidation, may represent promising strategies for mobilising therapeutic benefits of the ISR, translation suppression, or mTORC1 inhibition.",

It also plays an important role in the metabolic response to fasting. However, the mechanisms contributing to these physiological processes remain elusive.

Moreover, loss of Atg7 in Sf1 neurons causes alterations in the central response to fasting. Furthermore, alterations in mitochondria morphology and activity are observed in mutant mice.\n\nConclusionTogether, these data show that autophagy is nutritionally regulated in VMH neurons and that VMH autophagy participates in the control of energy homeostasis during fasting.",

    "abstract": "Early prenatal inflammatory conditions are thought to represent a risk factor for different neurodevelopmental disorders, with long-term consequences on adult brain connectivity. Here we show that a transient IL-6 elevation, occurring at vulnerable stages of early neurodevelopment, directly impacts brain developmental trajectories through the aberrant enhancement of glutamatergic synapses and overall brain hyper-connectivity. The IL6-mediated boost of excitatory synapse density results from the neuron-autonomous, genomic effect of the transcription factor STAT3 and causally involves the activation of RGS4 gene as a candidate downstream target. The STAT3/RGS4 pathway is also activated in neonatal brains as a consequence of maternal immune activation protocols mimicking a viral infection during pregnancy. By demonstrating that prenatal IL-6 elevations result in aberrant synaptic and brain connectivity through the molecular players identified, we provide a mechanistic framework for the association between prenatal inflammatory events and brain neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "The process of pyroptosis is mediated by inflammasomes and a downstream effector known as gasdermin D (GSDMD). Upon cleavage by inflammasome-associated caspases, the N-terminal domain of GSDMD forms membrane pores that promote cytolysis. Numerous proteins are recognized to promote GSDMD cleavage, but none are known to be required for pore formation after GSDMD cleavage. Herein, we report a forward genetic screen that was designed to identify regulators of pyroptosis that act downstream of GSDMD cleavage. This screen identified several components of the Ragulator-Rag complex, which is known for its metabolic control of mTOR. Mechanistic studies revealed that Ragulator-Rag is not necessary for GSDMD localization to the plasma membrane, but is necessary for pore formation and mitochondrial inactivation. Downstream of Ragulator-Rag is mTORC1, which we found to promote pyroptosis in response to diverse natural stimuli, including infection. GSDMD therefore requires a Ragulator-Rag-mTORC1 pathway in order to form pores and execute pyroptosis.",

Recently, sialic acids have been discovered as important compound in the extracellular matrix of virtually all microbial life and in \"Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis\", a well-studied polyphosphate-accumulating organism, in particular. Here, bioaggregates highly enriched with these bacteria (approx. 95% based on proteomic data) were used to study the production of NulOs in an enrichment of this microorganism.

Here, we discovered that reducing the expression of the gene ech-6 encoding enoyl-CoA hydratase remitted fat diet-induced deleterious effects on lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, while a basal expression of ech-6 was important for survival under normal dietary conditions. Lipidomics revealed that supplementation of fat in ech-6-silenced worms had marginal effects on lipid profiles, suggesting an alternative fat utilization for energy production. Transcriptomics further suggest a causal relation between the lysosomal pathway, energy production, and the longevity effect conferred by the interaction between ech-6 and high-fat diets. Indeed, enhancing energy production from endogenous fat by overexpressing lysosomal lipase lipl-4 recapitulated the lifespan effects of high-fat diets on ech-6-silenced worms. Collectively, these results reveal that the gene ech-6 modulates metabolic flexibility and may be a target for promoting metabolic health and longevity.",

    "abstract": "Germline stem cells divide asymmetrically to produce one new daughter stem cell and one daughter cell that will subsequently undergo meiosis and differentiate to generate the mature gamete. The silent sister hypothesis proposes that in asymmetric divisions, the selective inheritance of sister chromatids carrying specific epigenetic marks between stem and daughter cells impacts cell fate. To facilitate this selective inheritance, the hypothesis specifically proposes that the centromeric region of each sister chromatid is distinct. In Drosophila germ line stem cells (GSCs), it has recently been shown that the centromeric histone CENP-A (called CID in flies) - the epigenetic determinant of centromere identity - is asymmetrically distributed between sister chromatids. In these cells, CID deposition occurs in G2 phase such that sister chromatids destined to end up in the stem cell harbour more CENP-A, assemble more kinetochore proteins and capture more spindle microtubules. These results suggest a potential mechanism of  mitotic drive that might bias chromosome segregation. Here we report that the inner kinetochore protein CENP-C, is required for the assembly of CID in G2 phase in GSCs. Moreover, CENP-C is required to maintain a normal asymmetric distribution of CID between stem and daughter cells. In addition, we find that CID is lost from centromeres in aged GSCs and that a reduction in CENP-C accelerates this loss. Finally, we show that CENP-C depletion in GSCs disrupts the balance of stem and daughter cells in the ovary, shifting GSCs toward a self-renewal tendency. Ultimately, we provide evidence that centromere assembly and maintenance via CENP-C is required to sustain asymmetric divisions in female Drosophila GSCs.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial carrier family (MCF/SLC25) proteins are selective transporters that maintain the mitochondrial metabolome. Here we combine computational, biochemical and phenotypic approaches to understand substrate selectivity of SLC25A3. In mammals, SLC25A3 transports both copper and phosphate, yet in Saccharomyces cerevisiae the transport of these substrates is partitioned across two paralogs: PIC2, which transports copper, and MIR1, which transports phosphate. To understand whether the ancestral state of this transporter was a single promiscuous transporter that duplicated and gained selectivity, we explored the evolutionary relationships of PIC2 and MIR1 orthologs across the eukaryotic tree of life. Phylogenetic analyses reveal that PIC2-like and MIR1-like orthologs are present in all major eukaryotic supergroups, indicating that the gene duplication that created these paralogs occurred early in eukaryotic evolution. Frequent lineage-specific gene duplications and losses suggest that substrate specificity may be evolutionarily labile. To link this phylogenetic signal to protein function and resolve the residues involved in substrate selection, we used structural modelling and site-directed mutagenesis to identify PIC2 residues involved in copper and phosphate transport activities. Based on these analyses, we generated a Leu175Ala variant of mouse SLC25A3 that retains the ability to transport copper, but not phosphate, and rescues the cytochrome c oxidase defect in SLC25A3 knockout cells. Taken together, this work uses an evolutionary framework to uncover amino acids involved in substrate recognition by MCF proteins responsible for copper and phosphate transport.",

The Male-specific lethal dosage compensation complex (MSLc) increases transcript levels of genes along the length of the single male X-chromosome to equalize with that on the two female X-chromosomes. The strongest binding sites for MSLc cluster together in three-dimensional space independent of MSLc because clustering occurs in both sexes. CLAMP, a non-sex specific, ubiquitous zinc finger protein, binds synergistically with MSLc to enrich the occupancy of both factors on the male X-chromosome. Here, we demonstrate that CLAMP promotes the observed clustering of MSLc bindings sites. Genome-wide, CLAMP promotes interactions between active chromatin regions. Moreover, the X-enriched CLAMP protein more strongly promotes longer-range interactions on the X-chromosome than autosomes. Genome-wide, CLAMP promotes interactions between active chromatin regions together with other insulator proteins. Overall, we define how long-range interactions which are modulated by a locally enriched ubiquitous transcription factor promote hyper-activation of the X-chromosome to mediate dosage compensation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEmerging resistance to cephalosporins in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ng) is a major public health threat, since these are considered antibiotics of last resort. Continuous surveillance is needed to monitor the circulation of reduced susceptible and resistant strains.\n\nAimFor the purpose of epidemiological surveillance, a genomic population analysis was performed on Ng isolates from Amsterdam with a focus on ceftriaxone reduced susceptible isolates.\n\nMethodsWhole genome sequences were obtained from 318 isolates from 2014-2019 from Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Isolates were typed according to the Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme and resistance markers were identified. Phylogenetic trees were created to identify genetic clusters and to compare Dutch- and global MLST7827 isolates.\n\nResultsThe majority of ceftriaxone reduced susceptible isolates belonged to MLST7363, MLST1901 and MLST7827. MLST7363 and MLST1901 were dominant reduced susceptible strains from 2014-2016 although MLST7827 emerged and became dominant during 2017-2019. MLST7827 reduced susceptible isolates carried a non-mosaic penA gene with A501V mutation and porB G121K/A121D mutations, which were lacking in susceptible MLST7827 isolates. Phylogenetic analysis of all publicly available MLST7827 isolates showed strong genetic clustering of Dutch- and other European MLST7827 isolates.\n\nConclusionCeftriaxone reduced susceptible MLST7827 isolates emerged during recent years in Amsterdam. Co-occurrence of penA A501V and porB G121K/A121D mutations was strongly associated with ceftriaxone reduced susceptibility. Genetic clustering of Dutch- and other European MLST7827 isolates indicates extensive circulation of this strain in Europe. Therefore, close monitoring of the spread of this strain with an alarming susceptibility profile is needed.",

For a long time, these first line defenders were considered as microbe killers. However their role is far more complex as cross talk with T cells or dendritic cells have been described for human or mouse neutrophils. In cattle, these new roles are not documented yet. We identified a new subset of regulatory neutrophils that is present in the mouse bone marrow or circulate in cattle blood under steady state conditions. These regulatory neutrophils that display MHC-II on the surface are morphologically indistinguishable from classical MHC-IIneg neutrophils. However MHC-IIpos and MHC-IIneg neutrophils display distinct transcriptomic profiles. While MHC-IIneg and MHC-IIpos neutrophils display similar bacterial phagocytosis or killing activity, MHC-IIpos only are able to suppress T cell proliferation under contact-dependent mechanisms. Regulatory neutrophils are highly enriched in lymphoid organs as compared to their MHC-IIneg counterparts and in the mouse they express PDL-1, an immune checkpoint involved in T-cell blockade. Our results emphasize neutrophils as true partners of the adaptive immune response, including in domestic species.

    "abstract": "Atlantic Bluefin tuna (ABT) (Thunnus thynnus) travel long distances to spawn in oligotrophic regions of the Gulf of Mexico. To estimate regional larval ABT mortality, we developed a spatially-explicit, Lagrangian, individual-based model that simulates dispersal, growth, and mortality within realistic predator and prey fields during the spawning periods from 1993-2012. Modelled larval ABT experience high mortality in the first week of feeding with an average mortality rate of 0.53 {+/-} 0.26 d-1 prior to postflexion. Survival ranged from 0.12%-0.32% suggesting that recruitment may vary by a factor of 2.7 due to early life stage mortality alone. Starvation is the dominant source of mortality driven by the early critical period; however, survival is ultimately limited by predation on older individuals. As a result, first-feeding larvae survive better in the more food-rich areas on the shelf, while larger larvae survive better in the open ocean with fewer predators, making the shelf break an optimal spawning area. Our findings support the hypothesis that ABT spawn in oligotrophic regions to minimize predation on their larvae. Ocean modeling tools presented in this study may help facilitate an ecosystem-based management approach to improve future stock assessment models by better resolving the stock-recruitment relationship.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is controlled by regulatory elements with accessible chromatin. Although the majority of regulatory elements are cell type-specific, being in the open chromatin state in only one or a few cell types, approximately 16,000 regions in the human genome and 13,000 regions in the mouse genome are in the open chromatin state in nearly all of the 517 human and 94 mouse cell and tissue types assayed by the ENCODE consortium, respectively. We performed a systematic analysis on the subset of 9,000 human and 8,000 mouse ubiquitously (ubi) open chromatin regions that were also classified as candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) with promoter-like signatures (PLSs) by the ENCODE consortium, which we refer to as ubi-PLSs. We found that these ubi-PLSs had higher levels of CG dinucleotides and corresponded to the genes with ubiquitously high levels of transcriptional activities. Furthermore, the transcription start sites of a vast majority of cell-essential genes are located in ubi-PLSs. ubi-PLSs are enriched in the motifs of ubiquitously expressed transcription factors and preferentially bound by transcriptional cofactors that regulate ubiquitously expressed genes. Finally, ubi-PLSs are highly conserved between human and mouse at the synteny level, but not as conserved at the sequence level, with a high turnover of transcription factor motif sites. Thus, there is a distinct set of roughly 9,000 promoters in the mammalian genome that are actively maintained in the open chromatin state in nearly all cell types to ensure the transcriptional program of cell-essential genes.",

    "abstract": "Global carbon emissions and associated increase in ocean temperatures are understood to be the main driving force in the degradation of coral reefs. Elevated temperatures impact various life stages of scleractinian corals, from the free-floating planulae of brooding corals to older, sexually viable individuals. With global warming, questions have arisen over whether organismal adaptation will be enough to keep up with the pace of environmental change. Researchers have pursued investigations of whether or not rapid acclimatization, through transgenerational plasticity, can help protect populations until genetic adaptation occurs. Acclimatization in corals has been widely studied in all life stages of corals, with the important exception of recently settled juveniles. In this study, I built upon past research by exposing adult Pocillopora damicornis colonies to elevated (28.5{degrees}C) or ambient (25.5{degrees}C) temperatures and examining the settlement ability and growth of their planulae ex situ. Juveniles from preconditioned parents fared better in higher temperatures compared to their naive counterparts. Lunar timing of planula release between treatments peaked at different times in the lunar cycle. Peak planula release occurred on lunar day 23 for prestressed corals and on lunar day 7 for corals from ambient temperature seawaters. While future projects should follow up on these preliminary trials with in situ experiments to assess this phenomenon in the field, this study represents an important step in understanding how corals may be able to acclimatize and eventually adapt to climate change.",

    "abstract": "Low plasma levels of Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin 9 (PCSK9) are associated with decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. PCSK9 binds to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A (EGFA) domain of LDL receptors (LDLR), very low-density lipoprotein receptors (VLDLR), apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2), and lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and accelerates their degradation, thus acting as a key regulator of lipid metabolism. Antibody and RNAi - based PCSK9 inhibitor treatments lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular incidents in patients, but their high cost hampers market penetration. We sought to develop a safe, long-term and one-time solution to treat hyperlipidemia. We created a cDNA encoding a chimeric protein in which the extracellular N-terminus of glycophorin A was fused to the LDLR EGFA domain and introduced this gene into mouse bone marrow hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Following transplantation into irradiated mice, the animals produced red blood cells (RBCs) with the EGFA domain (EGFA-GPA RBCs) displayed on their surface. These animals showed significantly reduced plasma PCSK9 (66.5% decrease) and reduced LDL levels (40% decrease) for as long as 12 months post-transplantation. Furthermore, the EGFA-GPA mice remained lean for life and maintained normal body weight under high-fat diet. Hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy can generate red blood cells expressing an EGFA - glycophorin A chimeric protein as a practical and long-term strategy for treating chronic hyperlipidemia and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Biomarkers are known to be the key driver behind targeted cancer therapies by either stratifying the patients into risk categories or identifying patient subgroups most likely to benefit. However, the ability of a biomarker to stratify patients relies heavily on the type of clinical endpoint data being collected. Of particular interest is the scenario when the biomarker involved is a continuous one where the challenge is often to identify cut-offs or thresholds that would stratify the population according to the level of clinical outcome or treatment benefit. On the other hand, there are well-established Machine Learning (ML) methods such as the Support Vector Machines (SVM) that classify data, both linear as well as non-linear, into subgroups in an optimal way. SVMs have proven to be immensely useful in data-centric engineering and recently researchers have also sought its applications in healthcare. Despite their wide applicability, SVMs are not yet in the mainstream of toolkits to be utilised in observational clinical studies or in clinical trials. This research investigates the very role of SVMs in stratifying the patient population based on a continuous biomarker across a variety of datasets. Based on the mathematical framework underlying SVMs, we formulate and fit algorithms in the context of biomarker stratified cancer datasets to evaluate their merits. The analysis reveals their superior performance for certain data-types when compared to other ML methods suggesting that SVMs may have the potential to provide a robust yet simplistic solution to stratify real cancer patients based on continuous biomarkers, and hence accelerate the identification of subgroups for improved clinical outcomes or guide targeted cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "Maize production, area and yield dynamics were assessed based on farmer perceptions and production data from 2004/05-2018/19 using 36 000 households in Salima, central Malawi. The results showed that farmers used 16, six and two varieties for hybrid, Open-pollinated varieties (OPV) and local maize respectively. Farmers sourced Hybrid and OPV maize seed from Private Agro dealers while local maize was own-sourced. Farmers preferred local maize for being cheap, good taste, low storage costs, and pest resistance although low yielding. They preferred hybrid and OPV maize for high yielding and early maturity despite demanding high storage costs, pest susceptibility, and low flour. From 2004/05-2018/19, the area under local and OPV maize reduced by 61% and 12% respectively, while that of hybrid maize increased by 49%. However, the consistent decrease in area for hybrid and OPV and significant increase of that of local maize from 2014/15-2018/19 may signal a catastrophic maize production in the region. From 2019/20-2025/26 production of all maize was projected at 44 172 tons by 2025/26, representing a 1.6% increase from the base year 2019/20. This increase will be due to favorable climatic conditions and not increase in area or yield. If maize yield was improved by 30% production would increase to 110 430 tons representing 67% of the food requirement in the study area. The current maize production trend in Salima does not guarantee food security prospects. Therefore, policymakers should consider reviewing the past interventions (input pricing, promotion strategies, sustainable practices, policies) in the maize subsector to enhance maize productivity.",

    "abstract": "Compared to emblematic large carnivores, less charismatic or smaller carnivore species often receive little conservation attention, despite facing increasing anthropogenic pressure, and their status being poorly understood across much of their range. We employed systematic camera trapping and spatially explicit capture-recapture modelling to estimate variation in population density of serval, striped hyaena and aardwolf across the mixed-use Ruaha-Rungwa landscape in southern Tanzania. Three sites were selected as representative of different habitat types, management strategies, and levels of anthropogenic pressure: Ruaha National Parks core tourist area, dominated by Acacia-Commiphora bushlands and thickets; the Parks miombo woodland; and the neighbouring community-run MBOMIPA Wildlife Management Area, also covered in Acacia-Commiphora.\n\nOur results show that the Parks miombo woodlands supported a higher serval density than the core tourist area and Wildlife Management Area, with 5.56 [Standard Error = {+/-}2.45], 3.45 [{+/-}1.04] and 2.08 [{+/-}0.74] individuals per 100 km2, respectively. This variation is likely driven by precipitation, the abundance of apex predators, and the level of anthropogenic pressure.\n\nStriped hyaena were detected only in the Wildlife Management Area and at low density (1.36 [{+/-}0.5] individuals per 100 km2), potentially due to the location of the surveyed sites at the edge of the species global range, high densities of sympatric competitors and anthropogenic edge effects.\n\nFinally, aardwolf were captured in both the Parks core tourist area and the Wildlife Management Area, with a higher density in the Wildlife Management Area (13.25 [{+/-}2.48] versus 9.19 [{+/-}1.66] individuals per 100 km2), possibly as a result of lower intraguild predation and late fire outbreaks in the area surveyed.\n\nBy shedding light on three understudied African carnivore species, this study highlights the importance of miombo woodland conservation and community-managed conservation, as well as the value of camera trap data to improve ecological knowledge of lesser-studied carnivores.",

Here, we interrogated genomic profiles of 1,351 gliomas, and further identify 60 cases harboring MET alterations, including MET fusions and various MET exon skipping events. MET RNA alterations, but not MET amplification, are highly enriched in the secondary glioblastomas (sGBM) with significantly worse prognosis. Further molecular analysis has shown that MET RNA alterations acting an additive effects of MET overexpression are induced in the course of glioma evolution. In vitro and clinical studies indicate cells and patients harboring MET alterations have better response to MET inhibitors.

    "abstract": "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides essential public health information and is used worldwide for pathogen surveillance, epidemiology, and source tracking. The sequencing of foodborne pathogens is commonly performed with Illumina sequencing chemistry to obtain data with high accuracy. The choice of library preparation method for highly complex organisms is very critical and can affect the final data output. The majority of Illumina sequencing platforms use rapid library preparation such as Nextera XT (transposon-based technology) (Illumina San Diego, CA), but this preparation has the potential to miss randomly distributed segments of genomes that might be important for downstream analyses. The Illumina Nextera DNA Prep library preparation kit, the successor of Nextera XT, shows better overall coverage of the complete genome. This study compared the quality of sequence data generated using Nextera XT and Nextera DNA Prep kits for DNA library preparation on an Illumina MiSeq, using a set of 30 O121:H19 shiga-toxin positive Escherichia coli strains isolated from flour during a 2016 outbreak. The performance of the two kits were evaluated using several metrics including sequencing quality, assembly quality, uniformity of genome coverage, and virulence gene identification. Overall, the results showed that in all of the analysed metrics, the Nextera DNA Prep kit performed outstanding in comparison to Nextera XT. The Nextera DNA Prep kit allowed for comprehensive detection of all virulence genes, which is of extremely high importance for making an educated assessment of the virulence potential of Escherichia coli. This comprehensive side-by-side comparison will be of significance for those interested in improving their sequencing workflow for STECs and the determination of health risks using WGS data.",

We investigated whether liquid chalk is an antiseptic against highly pathogenic human viruses including, SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus and noroviruses. Chalk was applied before or after virus inoculum and recovery of infectious virus was determined to mimic the use in the gym. We observed that addition of chalk before or after virus contact lead to a significant reduction on recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and influenza but had little impact on norovirus. These observations suggest that the use and application of liquid chalk can be an effective and suitable antiseptic for major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games.",

The effects were reported as enhanced cell migration, proliferation, colony formation, and differentiation ability. However, there are significant differences in methodologies and cell type-specific outcomes, which made it difficult to find a systematic pattern in the results. We suggest that future experiments should consider using: 1) a more controlled acoustic environment), 2) standardized sound and noise measurement methods, and 3) a more comprehensive range of controlled sound stimuli.",

Our analysis revealed the presence of strong linkage disequilibrium in L. monocytogenes, with [~]99% of genes showing significant non-random associations with a large majority of other genes in the genome. Twenty-seven loci having lower levels of association with other genes were considered to be potential \"hot spots\" for horizontal gene transfer (i.e., recombination via conjugation, transduction, and/or transformation). The patterns of linkage disequilibrium in L. monocytogenes suggest limited exchange of foreign genetic material in the genome and can be used as a tool for identifying new recombinant strains. This can help understand processes contributing to the diversification and evolution of this pathogenic bacteria, thereby facilitating development of effective control measures.",

To address the lack of cell dispersal in traditional seeding methods, we have designed a two-step bioreactor. The first step rotates a seeded lung every 20 minutes at different angles to ensure 20 percent of cells are anchored to a particular location based on the known rate of attachment. The second step involves perfusion culture to ensure nutrient dispersion and cellular growth. Compared to statically seeded lungs followed by conventional perfusion, rotationally seeded lungs followed by perfusion had significantly increased dsDNA content and more uniform cellular distribution.

Here we present scCapsNet-mask, an updated version of scCapsNet that utilizes a mask to fully automate the running process of scCapsNet. scCapsNet-mask could constrain the internal parameter coupling coefficients and result in a one to one correspondence between the primary capsule and type capsule. Based on those bijective mapping between primary capsule and type capsule, the model could automatically extract the cell type related genes according to weight matrix connecting input and primary capsule, without a need for manual inspection of the relationship between primary capsules and type capsules. The scCapsNet-mask is evaluated on two single cell RNA sequence datasets. The results show that scCapsNet-mask not only retains the merits of the original scCapsNet with high classification accuracy and high interpretability, but also has the virtue of automatic processing.",
