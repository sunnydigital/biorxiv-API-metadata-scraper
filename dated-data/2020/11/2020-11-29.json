    "abstract": "Podocytes are integral members of the filtration barrier in the kidney and are crucial for glomerular permselectivity. Podocytes are highly differentiated and vulnerable to an array of noxious stimuli during various clinical conditions whereas podocyte loss plays a key role in progressive glomerular diseases. Elevated circulating growth hormone (GH) levels are associated with podocyte injury and proteinuria in diabetics. Previous studies have shown that podocytes express GH receptors (GHR), and induce Notch signaling when exposed to GH. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which excess GH elicits podocytopathy remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that GH induces cognate TGF-{beta}1 signaling and provokes cell cycle re-entry of otherwise quiescent podocytes. Though, differentiated podocytes re-enter the cell cycle in response to GH and TGF-{beta}1 unable to accomplish cytokinesis, despite nuclear division. Owing to this aberrant cell-cycle events significant amount of GH or TGF-{beta}1 treated cells remain binucleated and undergo mitotic catastrophe. Importantly, inhibition of GHR, TGFBR1, or Notch signaling prevented cell cycle re-entry and protects podocyte from cell death. Furthermore, inhibition of Notch activation prevents GH-dependent podocyte injury and proteinuria. Kidney biopsy sections from patients with diabetic nephropathy show activation of Notch signaling and bi-nucleated podocytes. All these data confirm that excess GH induces Notch1 signaling via TGF-{beta}1 and contributes to the mitotic catastrophe of podocytes. This study highlights the role of aberrant GH signaling in the podocytopathy and the potential application of inhibitors of TGF-{beta}1 or Notch inhibitors as a therapeutic agent for diabetic nephropathy.\n\nSignificance StatementElevated circulating levels of growth hormone (GH) associated with glomerular hypertrophy and proteinuria. Whereas decreased GH action protected against proteinuria. Podocytes are highly differentiated cells that play a vital role in glomerular filtration and curb protein loss. The direct role of GH in podocytes is the focus of our study. We found that GH induces TGF-{beta}1 and both provoke cell cycle re-entry of podocytes in Notch1 dependent manner. Notch activation enables the podocytes to accomplish karyokinesis, but not cytokinesis owing to which podocytes remain binucleated. Binucleated podocytes that were observed during GH/TGF-{beta}1 treatment are susceptible to cell death. Our study highlighted the fact that enforcing the differentiated podocytes to re-enter the cell cycle results in mitotic catastrophe and permanent loss.",

    "abstract": "Despite the extreme and varying environmental conditions prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula, it has experienced several waves of human migrations following the out-of-Africa diaspora. Eventually, the inhabitants of the peninsula region adapted to the hot and dry environment. The adaptation and natural selection that shaped the extant human populations of the Arabian Peninsula region have been scarcely studied. In an attempt to explore natural selection in the region, we analyzed 662,750 variants in 583 Kuwaiti individuals. We searched for regions in the genome that display signatures of positive selection in the Kuwaiti population using an integrative approach in a conservative manner. We highlight a haplotype overlapping TNKS that showed strong signals of positive selection based on the results of the multiple selection tests conducted (integrated Haplotype Score, Cross Population Extended Haplotype Homozygosity, Population Branch Statistics, and log-likelihood ratio scores). Notably, the TNKS haplotype under selection potentially conferred a fitness advantage to the Kuwaiti ancestors for surviving in the harsh environment while posing a major health risk to present-day Kuwaitis.",

    "abstract": "The ecology of fear demonstrates how prey responses to avoid predation cause non-lethal effects at all ecological scales. Parasites also elicit defensive responses in hosts with associated non-lethal effects, which raises the longstanding, yet unresolved question of how non-lethal effects of parasites compare with those of predators. We developed a framework for systematically answering this question for all types of predator and parasite systems. Our framework predicts that trait responses and their non-lethal effects should be strongest from predators and parasites that do not kill individuals to feed on them, but which nevertheless damage fitness. Analysing trait response data on amphibians, which have been well-studied for this area of research, showed that individuals generally responded more directly to short-term predation risks than to parasitism. Apart from studies using amphibians, there have been few direct comparisons of responses to predation and parasitism, and none have incorporated responses to micropredators, parasitoids, or parasitic castrators, or examined their long-term consequences. Addressing these and other data gaps highlighted by our general framework can advance the field toward understanding how non-lethal effects shape real food webs, which contain multiple predator and parasite species.",

    "abstract": "Predicting compound-protein affinity is beneficial for accelerating drug discovery. Doing so without the often-unavailable structure data is gaining interest. However, recent progress in structure-free affinity prediction, made by machine learning, focuses on accuracy but leaves much to be desired for interpretability. Defining inter-molecular contacts underlying affinities as a vehicle for interpretability, our large-scale interpretability assessment finds previously-used attention mechanisms inadequate. We thus formulate a hierarchical multi-objective learning problem whose predicted contacts form the basis for predicted affinities. And we solve the problem by embedding protein sequences (by hierarchical recurrent neural networks) and compound graphs (by graph neural networks) with joint attentions between protein residues and compound atoms. We further introduce three methodological advances to enhance interpretability: (1) structure-aware regularization of attentions using protein sequence-predicted solvent exposure and residue-residue contact maps; (2) supervision of attentions using known inter-molecular contacts in training data; and (3) an intrinsically explainable architecture where atomic-level contacts or \"relations\" lead to molecular-level affinity prediction. The first two and all three advances result in DeepAffinity+ and DeepRelations, respectively. Our methods show generalizability in affinity prediction for molecules that are new and dissimilar to training examples. Moreover, they show superior interpretability compared to state-of-the-art interpretable methods: with similar or better affinity prediction, they boost the AUPRC of contact prediction by around 33, 35, 10, and 9-fold for the default test, new-compound, new-protein, and both-new sets, respectively. We further demonstrate their potential utilities in contact-assisted docking, structure-free binding site prediction, and structure-activity relationship studies without docking. Our study represents the first model development and systematic model assessment dedicated to interpretable machine learning for structure-free compound-protein affinity prediction.",

    "abstract": "New strategies that enable fast and accurate visualization of Candida biofilms are necessary to better study their structure and response to antifungals agents. Here, we applied whole slide imaging (WSI) to study biofilm formation of Candida species. Three relevant biofilm-forming Candida species (C. albicans ATCC 10231, C. glabrata ATCC 2001, and C. tropicalis ATCC 750) were cultivated on glass coverslips both in presence and absence of widely used antifungals. Accumulated biofilms were stained with fluorescent markers and scanned in both bright-field and fluorescence modes using a WSI digital scanner. WSI enabled clear assessment of both size and structural features of Candida biofilms. Quantitative analyses readily detected reductions in biofilm-covered surface area upon antifungal exposure. Furthermore, we show that the overall biofilm growth can be adequately assessed across both bright-field and fluorescence modes. At the single-cell level, WSI proved adequate, as morphometric parameters evaluated with WSI did not differ significantly from those obtained with scanning electron microscopy, considered as golden standard at single-cell resolution. Thus, WSI allows for reliable visualization of Candida biofilms enabling both large-scale growth assessment and morphometric characterization of single-cell features, making it an important addition to the available microscopic toolset to image and analyze fungal biofilm growth.",

    "abstract": "When gene regulatory networks diverge between species, their dysfunctional expression in inter-species hybrid individuals can create genetic incompatibilities that generate the developmental defects responsible for intrinsic post-zygotic reproductive isolation. Both cis- and trans-acting regulatory divergence can be hastened by directional selection through adaptation, sexual selection, and inter-sexual conflict, in addition to cryptic evolution under stabilizing selection. Dysfunctional sex-biased gene expression, in particular, may provide an important source of sexually-dimorphic genetic incompatibilities. Here, we characterize and compare male and female/hermaphrodite transcriptome profiles for sibling nematode species Caenorhabditis briggsae and C. nigoni, along with allele-specific expression in their F1 hybrids, to deconvolve features of expression divergence and regulatory dysfunction. Despite evidence of widespread stabilizing selection on gene expression, misexpression of sex-biased genes pervades F1 hybrids of both sexes. This finding implicates greater fragility of male genetic networks to produce dysfunctional organismal phenotypes. Spermatogenesis genes are especially prone to high divergence in both expression and coding sequences, consistent with a \"faster male\" model for Haldanes rule and elevated sterility of hybrid males. Moreover, underdominant expression pervades male-biased genes compared to female-biased and sex-neutral genes and an excess of cis-trans compensatory regulatory divergence for X-linked genes underscores a \"large-X effect\" for hybrid male expression dysfunction. Extensive regulatory divergence in sex determination pathway genes likely contributes to demasculinization of XX hybrids. The evolution of genetic incompatibilities due to regulatory versus coding sequence divergence, however, are expected to arise in an uncorrelated fashion. This study identifies important differences between the sexes in how regulatory networks diverge to contribute to sex-biases in how genetic incompatibilities manifest during the speciation process.\n\nAuthors summaryAs species diverge, many mutations that affect traits do so by altering gene expression. Such gene regulatory changes also accumulate in the control of static traits, due to compensatory effects of mutation on multiple regulatory elements. Theory predicts many of these changes to cause inter-species hybrids to experience dysfunctional gene expression that leads to reduced fitness, disproportionately affecting genes biased toward expression in one sex and that localize to sex chromosomes. Our analyses of genome-wide gene expression from Caenorhabditis nematode roundworms support these predictions. We find widespread rewiring of gene regulation, despite the extensive morphological stasis and conserved expression profiles that are hallmarks of these animals. Misregulation of expression in inter-species hybrids of both sexes is most severe for genes linked to the X-chromosome, but male organismal phenotypes are most disrupted in hybrids. This fragility of male genetic networks and sex differences in regulatory evolution of local versus distant elements may underlie feminized and sterile phenotypes among hybrids. Our work clarifies how distinct components of regulatory networks evolve and contribute to sex differences in the manifestation of genetic incompatibilities in the speciation process.",

To quantify information, we apply the Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC), a measure of signal compression indexing information. The LZC is combined with direct measurement of the dynamics of ISF themselves, namely their power spectral density by median frequency (MF). We demonstrate the following: (I) topographical differences in resting state between higher- and lower-order networks, showing statistically lower LZC in the former; (II) task-related changes in LZC; (III) modulation of LZC associated with MF changes, with low and high MF resting-state values correlated with different degrees of LZC change.

In this system, the names of species themselves take on additional functions, such as describing features of the organism or honoring individuals. Here, we analyze the connections between bird species descriptions and who they honor from 1950 to 2019 within a context of global structures of power and access to science to interrogate how authority over the natural world is designated through Western scientific naming practices. We find that 95% of bird species described during this period occur in the Global South, but these species are disproportionately described by and named in honor of individuals from the Global North. We also find an increase through time in authors from the Global South, but Global North authors continue to disproportionately hold first author positions. Our findings show how research and labor in the Global South continue to be disproportionately translated into power and authority in the Global North, upholding and re-enacting imperialistic structures of domination. Addressing these inequities as a scientific community will require reflection and collective dialogue on the social foundations and impacts of our science.\n\nFor working definitions of key terms, see Table 1.

    "abstract": "During decades-long infections in the cystic fibrosis (CF) airway, Pseudomonas aeruginosa undergoes selection. One bacterial genetic adaptation often observed in CF isolates is mucA mutations. MucA inhibits the sigma factor AlgU. Mutations in mucA lead to AlgU misregulation, resulting in a mucoid phenotype that is associated with poor CF disease outcomes. Due to its ability to be mutated, mucA is assumed to be dispensable for bacterial viability. Here we show that, paradoxically, a portion of mucA is essential in P. aeruginosa. We demonstrate that mucA is no longer required in a strain lacking algU, that mucA alleles encoding for proteins that do not bind to AlgU are insufficient for viability, and that mucA is no longer essential in mutant strains containing AlgU variants with reduced sigma factor activity. Furthermore, we found that overexpression of algU prevents cell growth in the absence of MucA, and that this phenotype can be rescued by overproduction of RpoD, the housekeeping sigma factor. Together, these results suggest that in the absence of MucA, the inability to regulate AlgU activity results in the loss of bacterial viability. Finally, we speculate that essentiality of anti-sigma factors that regulate envelope function may be a widespread phenomenon in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation is a common post-translational modification, and glycan biosynthesis is regulated by a set of  glycogenes. The role of transcription factors (TFs) in regulating the glycogenes and related glycosylation pathways is largely unknown. This manuscript presents a multi-omics data-mining framework to computationally predict putative, tissue-specific TF regulators of glycosylation. It combines existing ChIP-Seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing) and RNA-Seq data to suggest 22,519 potentially significant TF-glycogene relationships. This includes interactions involving 524 unique TFs and 341 glycogenes that span 29 TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) cancer types. Here, TF-glycogene interactions appeared in clusters or  communities, suggesting that changes in single TF expression during both health and disease may affect multiple carbohydrate structures. Upon applying the Fishers exact test along with glycogene pathway classification, we identify TFs that may specifically regulate the biosynthesis of individual glycan types. Integration with knowledge from the Reactome database provided an avenue to relate cell-signaling pathways to TFs and cellular glycosylation state. Whereas analysis results are presented for all 29 cancer types, specific focus is placed on human luminal and basal breast cancer disease progression. Overall, the computational predictions in this manuscript present a starting point for systems-wide validation of TF-glycogene relationships.",

Oscillations also play an important role in normal physiological processes and serve distinct functional roles at different points in time. We characterised the effect of dopaminergic medication on oscillatory whole-brain networks in PD in a time-resolved manner by employing a hidden Markov model on combined STN local field potentials and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings from 17 PD patients. Dopaminergic medication led to coherence within the medial and orbitofrontal cortex in the delta/theta frequency range. This is in line with known side effects of dopamine treatment such as deteriorated executive functions in Parkinsons disease. In addition, dopamine caused the beta band activity to switch from an STN-mediated motor network to a frontoparietal-mediated one. In contrast, dopamine did not modify local STN-STN coherence in PD. STN-STN synchrony emerged both on and off medication. By providing electrophysiological evidence for the differential effects of dopaminergic medication on the discovered networks, our findings open further avenues for electrical and pharmacological interventions in PD.",

Here, we identify two distinct stages of mitotic force generation that follow rounding: (1) protrusive forces along the mitotic axis that drive mitotic elongation, and (2) outward forces that facilitate post-mitotic re-spreading. Cytokinetic ring contraction of the mitotic cell, but not activity of neighboring cells, generates extracellular forces that propel mitotic elongation and also contribute to chromosome separation. Forces from mitotic elongation are observed in epithelia across many model organisms. Thus, forces from mitotic elongation represent a universal mechanism that powers mitosis in confining epithelia.",

    "abstract": "Small molecules that target the spliceosome SF3B complex are potent inhibitors of cancer cell growth. The compounds affect an early stage of spliceosome assembly when U2 snRNP first engages the branch point sequence of an intron. Recent cryo-EM models of U2 snRNP before and after intron recognition suggest several large-scale rearrangements of RNA and protein interactions involving SF3B. Employing an inactive herboxidiene analog as a competitor with SF3B inhibitors, we present evidence for multiple conformations of SF3B in the U2 snRNP, only some of which are available for productive inhibitor interactions. We propose that both thermodynamics and an ATP-binding event promote the conformation conducive to SF3B inhibitor interactions. However, SF3B inhibitors do not impact an ATP-dependent rearrangement in U2 snRNP that exposes the branch binding sequence for base pairing. We also report extended structure activity relationship analysis of herboxidiene, which identified features of the tetrahydropyran ring that mediate its interactions with SF3B and its ability to interfere with splicing. In combination with structural models of SF3B interactions with inhibitors, our data leads us to extend the model for early spliceosome assembly and inhibitor mechanism. We postulate that interactions between a carboxylic acid substituent of herboxidiene and positively charged SF3B1 sidechains in the inhibitor binding channel are required to maintain inhibitor occupancy and counteract the SF3B transition to a closed state that is promoted by stable U2 snRNA interactions with the intron.",

    "abstract": "Bite force is an ecologically important biomechanical performance measure is informative in inferring the ecology of extinct taxa. However, biomechanical modelling to estimate bite force is associated with some level of uncertainty. Here, I assess the accuracy of bite force estimates in extinct taxa using a Bayesian phylogenetic prediction model. I first fitted a phylogenetic regression model on a training set comprising extant data. The model predicts bite force from body mass and skull width while accounting for differences owning to biting position. The posterior predictive model has a 93% prediction accuracy as evaluated through leave-one-out cross-validation. I then predicted bite force in 37 species of extinct mammals and archosaurs from the posterior distribution of predictive models.\n\nBiomechanically estimated bite forces fall within the posterior predictive distributions for all except four species of extinct taxa, and are thus as accurate as that predicted from body size and skull width, given the variation inherent in extant taxa and the amount of time available for variance to accrue. Biomechanical modelling remains a valuable means to estimate bite force in extinct taxa and should be reliably informative of functional performances and serve to provide insights into past ecologies.",

    "abstract": "Compared to multicellular fungi and unicellular yeasts, unicellular fungi with free-living flagellated stages (zoospores) remain poorly known and their phylogenetic position is often unresolved. Recently, rRNA gene phylogenetic analyses of two atypical parasitic fungi with amoeboid zoospores and long kinetosomes, the sanchytrids Amoeboradix gromovi and Sanchytrium tribonematis, showed that they formed a monophyletic group without close affinity with known fungal clades. Here, we sequence single-cell genomes for both species to assess their phylogenetic position and evolution. Phylogenomic analyses using different protein datasets and a comprehensive taxon sampling result in an almost fully-resolved fungal tree, with Chytridiomycota as sister to all other fungi, and sanchytrids forming a well-supported, fast-evolving clade sister to Blastocladiomycota. Comparative genomic analyses across fungi and their allies (Holomycota) reveal an atypically reduced metabolic repertoire for sanchytrids. We infer three main independent flagellum losses from the distribution of over 60 flagellum-specific proteins across Holomycota. Based on sanchytrids phylogenetic position and unique traits, we propose the designation of a novel phylum, Sanchytriomycota. In addition, our results indicate that most of the hyphal morphogenesis gene repertoire of multicellular fungi had already evolved in early holomycotan lineages.",

We investigated environmental and physiological influences on pitch perception, whose properties are commonly linked to peripheral neural coding limits. We first trained artificial neural networks to estimate fundamental frequency from biologically faithful cochlear representations of natural sounds. The best-performing networks replicated many characteristics of human pitch judgments. To probe the origins of these characteristics, we then optimized networks given altered cochleae or sound statistics. Human-like behavior emerged only when cochleae had high temporal fidelity and when models were optimized for naturalistic sounds. The results suggest pitch perception is critically shaped by the constraints of natural environments in addition to those of the cochlea, illustrating the use of artificial neural networks to reveal underpinnings of behavior.",

As an essential brain hub of social cognition and emotion regulation, we will also explore the association between graphic properties of the frontal network and individual personality traits under oxytocin (OT) administration. 59 male participants administered intranasal OT or placebo were followed by restingstate fMRI scanning. The Correlation-based network model was applied to study OT modulation effects. We performed community detection algorithms and conducted further network analyses, including clustering coefficient, average shortest path and eigenvector centrality. In addition, we conducted a correlation analysis between clustering coefficients and the self-assessed psychological scales. Modular organizations in the OT group reveal integrations of the frontoparietal network (FPN) and the default mode network (DMN) over frontal regions. Results show that frontal nodes within the FPN are characterized by lower clustering coefficients and higher average shortest path values compared to the placebo group. Notably, these modulation effects on frontal network property are associated with Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) fantasy value. Our results suggest that OT elevates integrations between FPN, DMN and limbic system as well as reduces small-worldness within the FPN.

We aimed to evaluate: (i) whether COVID-19-related preprints were favored for publication, (ii) preprinting trends and public discussion of the preprints, and (iii) the relationship between the publication topic (COVID-19-related or not) and quality issues.\n\nMethodsManuscripts deposited at bioRxiv and medRxiv between January 1 and September 27 were assessed for the probability of publishing in peer-reviewed journals, and those published were evaluated for submission-to-acceptance time. The extent of public discussion was assessed based on Altmetric and Disqus data. The Retraction Watch Database and PubMed were used to explore the retraction of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 articles and preprints.\n\nResultsWith adjustment for the preprinting server and number of deposited versions, COVID-19-related preprints were more likely to be published within 120 days since the deposition of the first version (OR=2.04, 95%CI 1.87-2.23) as well as over the entire observed period (OR=1.42, 95%CI 1.33-1.52). Submission-to-acceptance was by 38.67 days (95%CI 34.96-42.39) shorter for COVID-19 articles. Public discussion of preprints was modest and COVID-19 articles were overrepresented in the pool of retracted articles in 2020.\n\nConclusionCurrent data suggest a preference for publication of COVID-19-related preprints over the observed period.",

    "abstract": "Excessive discharge of hazardous azo dyes into the aquatic ecosystem is a global environmental concern. Here, we develop a green approach to remediate dye pollutions in water by fabricating an easy-separable bio-nanocomposite, based on whey protein concentrate, its nanofibrils, and montmorillonite nano-clay. To characterize the nanocomposite, we used SEM, FT-IR, XRD, and BET techniques. Nanofibrils lead to a uniform dispersion of montmorillonite in the whey protein matrix and also reinforce the nanocomposite. The adsorption efficacy was monitored in a batch system, using cationic dyes (Chrysoidine-G, Bismarck brown-R), reactive dyes (reactive black-5, reactive orange-16), acid dyes (acid red-88, acid red-114), and direct dyes (direct violet-51, Congo red). This nanocomposite adsorbed different dye classes, cationic dyes quicker (> 82%, after 4 h), and reactive dyes slower. Then, the effect of initial dye concentration, pH, contact time, adsorbent dose, and temperature on Chrysoidine-G adsorption was explored. The adsorbent showed a high removal (>93%) for a wide concentration range of Chrysoidine-G, also acidic pH and higher temperature are more favorable for the process. Equilibrium adsorption parameters were reasonably fitted with a linear (Nernst) isotherm model. The results indicated the existence of an unlimited number of absorption sites, i.e. no saturation was achieved under our experimental conditions (qmax(Exp)= 731 mg/g). Kinetic data were fitted with pseudo-second-order and intra-particle diffusion models. We conclude that this nanocomposite is a green adsorbent with potential use for wastewater treatment and related purposes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe produced an easy-separable bio-nanocomposite using whey nanofibrils and MMT, with high adsorption capacity\nC_LIO_LINanofibrils help disperse MMT particles uniformly in the WP matrix\nC_LIO_LIThe adsorbents performance was compared to the adsorbents in absence of MMT and nanofibrils\nC_LIO_LIThis composite adsorbs cationic, anionic, direct and reactive azo dyes with different kinetics\nC_LIO_LIAdsorption isotherms and kinetics are studied in detail\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/394205v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13aa68eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18cc8c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cff49eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c4de1c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Proteins involved with RBC binding and invasion are secreted from dual-club shaped organelles at the apical tip of the merozoite called the rhoptries. Here we characterise P. falciparum Cytosolically Exposed Rhoptry Leaflet Interacting protein 2 (PfCERLI2), as a rhoptry bulb protein that is essential for merozoite invasion. Phylogenetic analyses show that cerli2 arose through an ancestral gene duplication of cerli1, a related cytosolically exposed rhoptry bulb protein. We show that PfCERLI2 is essential for blood-stage growth and localises to the cytosolic face of the rhoptry bulb. Inducible knockdown of PfCERLI2 led to an inhibition of merozoite invasion after tight junction formation. PfCERLI2 knockdown was associated with inhibition of rhoptry antigen processing and a significant elongation of the rhoptries, suggesting that the inability of merozoites to invade is caused by aberrant rhoptry function due to PfCERLI2 deficiency. These findings identify PfCERLI2 as a protein that has key roles in rhoptry biology during merozoite invasion.",

    "abstract": "Simultaneous recording of EEG and fMRI is a very promising non-invasive neuroimaging technique, providing a wide range of complementary information to characterize underlying mechanisms associated with brain functions. However, EEG data obtained from the simultaneous EEG-fMRI recordings are strongly influenced by MRI related artefacts, namely gradient artefacts (GA) and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artefacts. The GA is induced by temporally varying magnetic field gradients used for MR imaging, whereas the BCG artefacts are produced by cardiac pulse driven head motion in the strong magnetic field of the MRI scanner, so that this BCG artefact will be present when the subject is lying in the scanner, even when no fMRI data are acquired. When compared to corrections of the GA, the BCG artefact corrections are more challenging to remove due to its inherent variabilities and dynamic changes over time. Typically, the BCG artefacts obscure the EEG signals below 20Hz, and this remains problematic especially when the frequency of interest of EEG signals is below 20Hz, such as Alpha (8-13Hz) and Beta (13-30Hz) band EEG activity, or sleep spindle (11-16Hz) and slow-wave oscillations (<1 Hz) during sleep. The standard BCG artefact corrections, as for instance Average Artefact Subtraction method (AAS), require detecting cardiac pulse (R-peak) events from simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) recordings. However, ECG signals in the MRI scanner are sometimes distorted and will become problematic for detecting reliable R-peaks. In this study, we focused on a beamforming technique, which is a spatial filtering technique to reject sources of signal variance that do not appear dipolar in the source space. This technique attenuates all unwanted source activities outside of a presumed region of interest without having to specify the location or the configuration of these underlying source signals. Specifically, in this study, we revisited the advantages of the beamforming technique to attenuate the BCG artefact in EEG-fMRI, and also to recover meaningful task-based induced neural signals during an attentional network task (ANT) which required participants to identify visual cues and respond as accurately and quickly as possible. We analysed EEG-fMRI data in 20 healthy participants when they were performing the ANT, and compared four different BCG correction approaches (non-BCG corrected, AAS BCG corrected, beamforming+AAS BCG corrected, beamforming BCG corrected). We demonstrated that beamforming BCG corrected data did not only significantly reduce the BCG artefacts, but also significantly recovered the expected task-based induced brain activity when compared to the standard AAS BCG corrections. Without detecting R-peak events from the ECG, this data-driven beamforming technique appears promising especially for longer data acquisition of sleep and resting EEG-fMRI. Our findings extend previous work regarding the recovery of meaningful EEG signals by an optimized suppression of MRI related artefacts.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBeamforming spatial filtering technique attenuates ballistocardiogram (BCG) artefacts in EEG-fMRI without detecting cardiac pulses in electrocardiography (ECG) recordings.\nC_LIO_LIBeamforming BCG denoising technique recovers expected task-based induced visual alpha and motor beta event-related desynchronization (ERD).\nC_LIO_LIBeamforming technique improves signal-noise ratios (SNR) of neural activities as compared to sensor level signals.\nC_LIO_LIData-driven beamforming technique appears promising for longer data acquisition of sleep and resting EEG-fMRI without relying on ECG signals.\nC_LI",

Here, we identified a lineage-restricted gene, which we named lg. Combined omics analyses showed that lg is under positive selection in the most species-rich lineage of cichlid fishes, the modern haplochromine (MH) lineage, indicating its evolutionary advantage. Using transgenic zebrafish, we functionally showed that a cichlid fish-specific upstream insertion of lg can drive new and strong eGFP expression in tissues noted for adaptation in the MH lineage, but not in other lineages. Furthermore, the deletion of three MH-specific SNPs within this region can reconstitute weak and limited expression patterns similar to those in non-MH lineages. We thus demonstrated that a series of cis-regulatory changes in an advantageous gene are linked with a gain of expression that is related to an astonishingly adaptive radiative lineage.",

During epidemics, it can destroy over 100 million cubic meters of spruce trees in a single year. Here we report a 236 Mb, highly contiguous I. typographus genome assembly using PacBio long-read sequencing. The final phased assembly had a contig N50 of 6.65 Mb in 272 contigs and was predicted to contain 23,923 protein-coding genes. Comparative genomic analysis revealed expanded gene families associated with plant cell wall degradation, including pectinases, aspartyl proteases, and glycosyl hydrolases. In todays forests, increasingly stressed by global warming, this resource can assist in mitigating bark beetle outbreaks by developing novel pest control strategies. Further, this first whole-genome sequence from the genus Ips provides timely resources to address important questions about the evolutionary biology and ecology of Curculionidae, the true weevils, one of the largest animal families.",

    "abstract": "Ultrahigh dose-rate (FLASH) radiotherapy has attracted immense attention because of its tumor control efficiency and healthy tissue protection during preclinical experiments with electrons, kilo-voltage X-rays, and protons. Using high-energy X-rays (HEXs) in FLASH is advantageous owing to its deep penetration, small divergence, and cost-effectiveness. This is the first report on the implementation of HEXs with FLASH (HEX-FLASH) and its corresponding application in vivo. With a high-current and high-energy superconducting linear accelerator, FLASH with a good dose rate and high penetration was achieved. Breast cancers artificially induced in BAL b/c mice were efficiently controlled, and normal tissues surrounding the thorax/abdomen in C57BL/6 mice were protected from radiation with HEX-FLASH. Theoretical analyses of cellular responses following HEX-FLASH irradiation were performed to interpret the experimental results and design further experiments. Thus, this study highlights the generation of HEX-FLASH for the first time and its potential in future clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany human diseases are known to have a genetic contribution. While genome-wide studies have identified many disease-associated loci, it remains challenging to elucidate causal genes. In contrast, exome sequencing provides an opportunity to identify new disease genes and large-effect variants of clinical relevance. We therefore sought to determine the contribution of rare genetic variation in a curated set of human diseases and traits using a unique resource of 200,000 individuals with exome sequencing data from the UK Biobank.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe included 199,832 participants with a mean age of 68 at follow-up. Exome-wide gene-based tests were performed for 64 diseases and 23 quantitative traits using a mixed-effects model, testing rare loss-of-function and damaging missense variants. We identified 51 known and 23 novel associations with 26 diseases and traits at a false-discovery-rate of 1%. There was a striking risk associated with many Mendelian disease genes including: MYPBC3 with over a 100-fold increased odds of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, PKD1 with a greater than 25-fold increased odds of chronic kidney disease, and BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM and PALB2 with 3 to 10-fold increased odds of breast cancer. Notable novel findings included an association between GIGYF1 and type 2 diabetes (OR 5.6, P=5.35x10-8), elevated blood glucose, and lower insulin-like-growth-factor-1 levels. Rare variants in CCAR2 were also associated with diabetes risk (OR 13, P=8.5x10-8), while COL9A3 was associated with cataract (OR 3.4, P=6.7x10-8). Notable associations for blood lipids and hypercholesterolemia included NR1H3, RRBP1, GIGYF1, SCGN, APH1A, PDE3B and ANGPTL8. A number of novel genes were associated with height, including DTL, PIEZO1, SCUBE3, PAPPA and ADAMTS6, while BSN was associated with body-mass-index. We further assessed putatively pathogenic variants in known Mendelian cardiovascular disease genes and found that between 1.3 and 2.3% of the population carried likely pathogenic variants in known cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia or hypercholesterolemia genes.\n\nConclusionsLarge-scale population sequencing identifies known and novel genes harboring high-impact variation for human traits and diseases. A number of novel findings, including GIGYF1,represent interesting potential therapeutic targets. Exome sequencing at scale can identify a meaningful proportion of the population that carries a pathogenic variant underlying cardiovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Enzymatic reactions in cells are well organized into different compartments, among which protein-based membraneless compartments formed through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) are believed to play important roles1,2. Hijacking them for our own purpose has promising applications in metabolic engineering3. Yet, it is still hard to precisely and dynamically control target enzymatic reactions in those compartments4. To address those problems, we developed Photo-Activated Switch in E. coli (PhASE), based on phase separating scaffold proteins and optogenetic tools. In this system, a protein of interest (POI) can be enriched up to 15-fold by LLPS-based compartments from cytosol within only a few seconds once activated by light, and become fully dispersed again within 15 minutes. Furthermore, we explored the potentiality of the LLPS-based compartment in enriching small organic molecules directly via chemical-scaffold interaction. With enzymes and substrates co-localized under light induction, the overall reaction efficiency could be enhanced. Using luciferin and catechol oxidation as model enzymatic reactions, we found that they could accelerate 2.3-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively, when regulated by PhASE. We anticipate our system to be an extension of the synthetic biology toolkit, facilitating rapid recruitment and release of POIs, and reversible regulation of enzymatic reactions.",

    "abstract": "PurposeAPR-246 (Eprenetapopt) is in clinical development with a focus on haematological malignancies and is marketed as a mutant-p53 reactivation therapy. Currently, the detection of at least one TP53 mutation is an inclusion criterion for patient selection into most clinical trials. Preliminary results from our phase Ib/II clinical trial investigating APR-246 combined with combination chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil) in metastatic oesophageal cancer, together with previous pre-clinical studies, indicate that TP53 mutation status alone may not be a sufficient biomarker for response to APR-246. This study aimed to identify a robust biomarker for response to APR-246.\n\nMethodsCorrelation analysis of the PRIMA-1 activity (lead compound to APR-246) with mutational status, gene expression, protein expression and metabolite abundance across over 800 cancer cell lines was performed. Functional validation and a boutique siRNA screen of over 750 redox-related genes were also conducted.\n\nResultsTP53 mutation status was not predictive of response to APR-246. The expression of SLC7A11, the cystine/glutamate transporter, was identified as a superior determinant of response to APR-246. Genetic regulators of SLC7A11, including ATF4, MDM2, wild-type p53 and c-Myc were confirmed to also regulate cancer cell sensitivity to APR-246.\n\nConclusionsSLC7A11 expression is the major determinant of sensitivity to APR-246 and should be utilised as a predictive biomarker in future clinical investigation of APR-246.",

    "abstract": "Grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) is a grain legume commonly grown in parts of Asia and Africa for food and forage. While being a highly nutritious and robust crop, able to survive both drought and floods, it produces a neurotoxic compound, {beta}-N-oxalyl-L-,{beta}-diaminopropionic acid ({beta}-ODAP), which can cause a severe neurological disorder if consumed as a main diet component. So far, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of {beta}-ODAP has not been identified. By combining protein purification and enzymatic assays with transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, we were able to identify the enzyme {beta}-ODAP synthetase (BOS) from grass pea. We show that BOS is an HXXXD-type acyltransferase of the BAHD superfamily and that its crystal structure is highly similar to that of plant hydroxycinnamoyl transferases. The identification of BOS, more than 50 years after it was proposed, paves the way towards the generation of non-toxic grass pea cultivars safe for human and animal consumption.",

In this regard, it is absolutely imperative to understand the mechanism of metabolic reprogramming of host human cells by SARS Cov2. A better understanding of the metabolic alterations would aid in design of better therapeutics to deal with COVID-19 pandemic. We developed an integrated genome-scale metabolic model of normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) infected with SARS Cov2 using gene-expression and macromolecular make-up of the virus. The reconstructed model predicts growth rates of the virus in high agreement with the experimental measured values. Furthermore, we report a method for conducting genome-scale differential flux analysis (GS-DFA) in context-specific metabolic models. We apply the method to the context-specific model and identify severely affected metabolic modules predominantly comprising of lipid metabolism. We conduct an integrated analysis of the flux-altered reactions, host-virus protein-protein interaction network and phospho-proteomics data to understand the mechanism of flux alteration in host cells. We show that several enzymes driving the altered reactions inferred by our method to be directly interacting with viral proteins and also undergoing differential phosphorylation under diseased state. In case of SARS Cov2 infection, lipid metabolism particularly fatty acid oxidation and beta-oxidation cycle along with arachidonic acid metabolism are predicted to be most affected which confirms with clinical metabolomics studies. GS-DFA can be applied to existing repertoire of high-throughput proteomic or transcriptomic data in diseased condition to understand metabolic deregulation at the level of flux.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionFunctional changes in the aging human brain have been previously reported using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Earlier resting-state fMRI studies revealed an age-associated weakening of intra-system functional connectivity (FC) and age-associated strengthening of inter-system FC. However, the majority of such FC studies did not investigate the relationship between age and network amplitude, without which correlation-based measures of FC can be challenging to interpret. Consequently, the main aim of this study was to investigate how three primary measures of resting-state fMRI signal - network amplitude, network topography, and inter-network FC - are affected by healthy cognitive aging.\n\nMethodsWe acquired resting-state fMRI data on a 4.7 T scanner for 105 healthy participants representing the entire adult lifespan (18-85 years of age). To study age differences in network structure, we combined ICA-based network decomposition with sparse graphical models.\n\nResultsOlder adults displayed lower blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal amplitude in all functional systems with sensorimotor networks showing the largest age differences. Our age comparisons of network topography and inter-network FC demonstrated a substantial amount of age-invariance in the brains functional architecture. Despite architecture similarities, old adults displayed a loss of communication efficiency in our inter-network FC comparisons, driven primarily by FC reduction in frontal and parietal association cortices. Together, our results provide a comprehensive overview of age effects on fMRI-based FC.",

    "abstract": "Rhythm perception depends on the ability to predict the onset of rhythmic events. Previous studies indicate beta band modulation is involved in predicting the onset of auditory rhythmic events (Snyder & Large, 2005; Fujioka et al., 2009, 2012). We sought to determine if similar processes are recruited for prediction of visual rhythms by investigating whether beta band activity plays a role in a modality dependent manner for rhythm perception. We looked at source-level EEG time-frequency neural correlates of prediction using an omission paradigm with auditory and visual rhythms. By using omissions, we can separate out predictive timing activity from stimulus driven activity. We hypothesized that there would be modality specific markers of rhythm prediction in induced beta band oscillatory activity, characterized primarily by activation in the motor system specific to auditory rhythm processing. Our findings suggest the existence of overlapping networks of predictive beta activity based on common activation in the parietal and right frontal regions, auditory specific predictive beta in bilateral sensorimotor regions, and visually specific predictive beta in midline central, and bilateral temporal/parietal regions. We also found evidence for evoked predictive beta activity in the left sensorimotor region specific to auditory rhythms. These findings implicate modality dependent networks for auditory and visual rhythm perception. The results further suggest that auditory rhythm perception may have left hemispheric specific mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Standard anatomical templates are widely used in human neuroimaging processing pipelines to facilitate group level analyses and comparisons across different subjects and populations. The MNI-ICBM152 template is the most commonly used standard template, representing an average of 152 healthy young adult brains. However, in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), the high levels of atrophy lead to significant differences between the brain shape of the individuals and the MNI-ICBM152 template. Such differences might inevitably lead to registration errors or subtle biases in downstream analyses and results. Disease-specific templates are therefore desirable to reflect the anatomical characteristics of the populations of interest and to reduce potential registration errors when processing data from such populations.\n\nHere, we present MNI-FTD136, MNI-bvFTD70, MNI-svFTD36, and MNI-pnfaFTD30, four unbiased average templates of 136 FTD patients, 70 behavioural variant (bv), 36 semantic variant (sv), and 30 progressive nonfluent aphasia (pnfa) variant FTD patients as well as a corresponding age matched average template of 133 healthy controls (MNI-CN133), along with probabilistic tissue maps for each template. The public availability of these templates will facilitate analyses of FTD cohorts and enable comparisons between different studies in a common standardized space appropriate to FTD populations.",

    "abstract": "Odours are transported by turbulent air currents, creating complex temporal fluctuations in odour concentration. Recently, we have shown that mice can discriminate odour stimuli based on their temporal structure, indicating that information present in the temporal structure of odour plumes may be extracted by the mouse olfactory system. Here using in vivo electrophysiological recordings, we show that mitral and tufted cells (M/TCs), the projection neurons of the mouse olfactory bulb, can encode the dominant temporal frequencies present in odour stimuli up to frequencies of at least 20 Hz. We show that M/TCs couple their membrane potential to odour concentration fluctuations; coupling was variable between M/TCs but independent of the odour presented and with TCs displaying slightly elevated coupling compared to MCs in particular for higher frequency stimulation (20Hz). Pharmacologically blocking the inhibitory circuitry strongly modulated frequency coupling. Together this suggests that both cellular and circuit properties contribute to the encoding of temporal odour features in the mouse olfactory bulb.",

    "abstract": "Cortical stimulation is emerging as an experimental tool in basic research and a promising therapy for a range of neuropsychiatric conditions. As multielectrode arrays enter clinical practice, the possibility of using spatiotemporal patterns of electrical stimulation to induce desired physiological patterns has become theoretically possible, but in practice can only be implemented by trial-and-error because of a lack of predictive models. Experimental evidence increasingly establishes travelling waves as fundamental to cortical information-processing, but we lack understanding how to control wave properties despite rapidly improving technologies. This study uses a hybrid biophysical-anatomical and neural-computational model to predict and understand how a simple pattern of cortical surface stimulation could induce directional traveling waves via asymmetric activation of inhibitory interneurons. It reveals local circuit mechanisms to control spatiotemporal cortical dynamics and predicts interventions that can be developed to treat a broad range of cognitive disorders.",

    "abstract": "Memory, defined as an alteration in behavior towards a stimulus that follows as a consequence of experience, arises when a sensory stimulus is encountered at the same time that the animal experiences a negative or positive internal state. How this coincident detection of external and internal stimuli stably alters responses to the external stimulus is still not fully understood, especially in the context of an intact animal. One barrier to understanding how an intact biological circuit changes is knowing what molecular processes are required to establish and maintain the memory. The optically accessible and compact nervous system of C. elegans provides a unique opportunity to examine these processes. C. elegans can remember an odor such as butanone when it is paired with a single negative experience and the transient receptor potential (TRP) OSM-9/TRPV5/TRPV6 channel is known to be required for this memory. The multiple gating mechanisms of TRPV channels give them the potential to be the coincidence detectors required to integrate internal state and external stimuli. Here, we report that this TRPV channel is also required for acquisition and possibly consolidation of sleep-dependent, long-term memory of butanone. We find that in the anterior ganglion, endogenous GFP-tagged OSM-9 is expressed in the paired AWA olfactory neurons, the ASH nociceptive neuron pair, the mechanosensory OLQ tetrad, and the paired ADF and ADL sensory neurons. In these cells, OSM-9 protein is concentrated in the sensory endings, dendrites, and cell bodies, but excluded from the neurites in the nerve ring. In the tail, OSM-9 is expressed in the nociceptive phasmid neurons PHA and PHB, possibly PQR as well as PVP. In the midbody, it is possibly expressed in the mechanosensitive PVD neuron. It is notably absent from the AWC pair that are required for butanone attraction. Chronic loss of OSM-9 in a subset of ciliated neurons that do not include AWA interferes with consolidation but not learning. Because OSM-9 is expressed and required in sensory neurons that are not needed for butanone chemosensory behavior, two interpretations are possible. The first, is that OSM-9 loss leads to gain of function or neomorphic behavior of these cells that are extrinsic to the primary sensory circuit and their new activity interferes with acquisition and consolidation of memory. The second is that loss of OSM-9 leads to a loss of function phenotype in which the wild type function of these cells is diminished and this function is required for memory consolidation.\n\nAuthor summaryHow organisms learn from their environment and keep these memories for the long term ensures their survival. There is much known about the regions of the brain and the various proteins that are essential for memory, yet the exact molecular mechanisms and dynamics required are not known. We aimed to understand the genetics that underlie memory formation. We tested a gene that encodes a transient potential receptor channel vanilloid channel, which is similar to the channels we have that sense spicy foods and other harmful cues. Our studies have shown that this gene is required for the animal to be able to acquire and perhaps consolidate olfactory memory. This protein is not expressed in the sensory neurons that respond to the odor that is memorized or in other downstream interneurons in the odor-sensation circuit, but it is expressed in a distinct set of sensory neurons. This indicates that long-term memory involves wild type behavior of a wider array of sensory neurons than is required for the primary sensation. These channels are also implicated in neurological disorders where memory is affected, including Alzheimers disease. Understanding how memory formation is affected by cells outside the memory circuit might provide testable hypothesis about what goes awry in Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection takes a mild or clinically inapparent course in the majority of humans who contract this virus. After such individuals have cleared the virus, only the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific immunological memory can reveal the exposure, and hopefully the establishment of immune protection. With most viral infections, the presence of specific serum antibodies has provided a reliable biomarker for the exposure to the virus of interest. SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, does not reliably induce a durable antibody response, especially in sub-clinically infected individuals. Consequently, it is plausible for a recently infected individual to yield a false negative result within only a few months after exposure. Immunodiagnostic attention has therefore shifted to studies of specific T cell memory to SARS-CoV-2. Most reports published so far agree that a T cell response is engaged during SARS-CoV-2 infection, but they also state that in 20-81% of non-SARS-CoV-2-exposed individuals, T cells respond to SARS-CoV-2 antigens (mega peptide pools), allegedly due to T cell cross-reactivity with coronaviruses causing Common Cold (CCC), or other antigens. Here we show that by introducing irrelevant mega peptide pools as negative controls to account for chance cross-reactivity, and by establishing the antigen dose-response characteristic of the T cells, one can clearly discern between cognate T cell memory induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection vs. cross-reactive T cell responses in individuals who had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a zoonotic infection that emerged in the Middle East in 2012. Symptoms range from mild to severe and include both respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. The virus is mainly present in camel populations with occasional spill overs into humans. The severity of infection in humans is influenced by numerous factors and similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) underlying health complications can play a major role. Currently, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are co-incident in the Middle East and a rapid way is required of sequencing MERS-CoV to derive genotype information for molecular epidemiology. Additionally, complicating factors in MERS-CoV infections are co-infections that require clinical management. The ability to rapidly characterise these infections would be advantageous. To rapidly sequence MERS-CoV, we developed an amplicon-based approach coupled to Oxford Nanopore long read length sequencing. The advantage of this approach is that insertions and deletions can be identified - which are the major drivers of genotype change in coronaviruses. This and a metagenomic approach were evaluated on clinical samples from patients with MERS. The data illustrated that whole genome or near whole genome information on MERS-CoV could be rapidly obtained. This approach provided data on both consensus genomes and the presence of minor variants including deletion mutants. Whereas, the metagenomic analysis provided information of the background microbiome.",

Here, we explore the regulatory mechanisms that differentially control meiotic events. We demonstrate that the protease Separase rewires key cell division processes at the meiosis I/II transition by cleaving the meiosis-specific protein Meikin. In contrast to cohesin, which is inactivated by Separase proteolysis, cleaved Meikin remains functional, but results in a distinct activity state. Full-length Meikin and the C-terminal Meikin Separase-cleavage product both localize to kinetochores, bind to Plk1 kinase, and promote Rec8 cleavage, but our results reveal distinct roles for these proteins in controlling meiosis. Mutations that prevent Meikin cleavage or that conditionally inactivate Meikin at anaphase I both result in defective meiosis II chromosome alignment. Thus, Separase cleavage of Meikin creates an irreversible molecular switch to rewire the cell division machinery at the meiosis I/II transition.",

To enable analysis of the mechanisms underlying the phenotypic impacts of Csf1r mutation, we bred a rat Csf1rko allele to the inbred dark agouti (DA) genetic background and to a Csf1r-mApple reporter transgene. The Csf1rko led to almost complete loss of embryonic macrophages and ablation of most adult tissue macrophage populations. We extended previous analysis of the Csf1rko phenotype to early postnatal development to reveal impacts on musculoskeletal development and proliferation and morphogenesis in multiple organs. Expression profiling of 3-week old wild-type (WT) and Csf1rko livers identified 2760 differentially expressed genes associated with the loss of macrophages, severe hypoplasia, delayed hepatocyte maturation, disrupted lipid metabolism and the IGF1/IGF binding protein system. Older Csf1rko rats developed severe hepatic steatosis. Consistent with the developmental delay in the liver Csf1rko rats had greatly-reduced circulating IGF1. Transfer of WT bone marrow (BM) cells at weaning without conditioning repopulated resident macrophages in all organs, including microglia in the brain and reversed the mutant phenotypes enabling long term survival and fertility. WT BM transfer restored osteoclasts, eliminated osteopetrosis, restored bone marrow cellularity and architecture and reversed granulocytosis and B cell deficiency. Csf1rko rats had an elevated circulating CSF1 concentration which was rapidly reduced to WT levels following BMT. However, CD43hi non-classical monocytes, absent in the Csf1rko, were not rescued and bone marrow progenitors remained unresponsive to CSF1. The results demonstrate that the Csf1rko phenotype is autonomous to BM-derived cells and indicate that BM contains a progenitor of tissue macrophages distinct from hematopoietic stem cells. The model provides a unique system in which to define the pathways of development of resident tissue macrophages and their local and systemic roles in growth and organ maturation.",

    "abstract": "Molecular surveys of low temperature deep-sea hydrothermal vent fluids have shown that Campylobacteria (prev. Epsilonproteobacteria) often dominate the microbial community and that three subgroups - Arcobacter, Sulfurimonas and Sulfurovum - frequently coexist. In this study, we used replicated radiocarbon incubations of deep-sea hydrothermal fluids to investigate the activities of each group under three distinct incubation conditions. In order to quantify group-specific radiocarbon incorporation, we used newly designed oligonucleotide probes for Arcobacter, Sulfurimonas, and Sulfurovum to quantify their activity using catalyzed-reporter deposition fluorescence in-situ hybridization (CARD-FISH) combined with fluorescence-activated cell sorting. All three groups actively fixed CO2 in short-term (~ 20 h) incubations with either nitrate, oxygen, or no additions (control) at similar per-cell carbon fixation rates. Oxygen additions had the largest effect on community composition and overall cell numbers, and caused a pronounced shift in community composition at the amplicon sequence variant (ASV) level after only 20 h of incubation for all three groups. Interestingly, the effect of oxygen on carbon fixation rates appeared to depend on the initial starting community. Higher carbon fixation rates in oxygen-amended treatments were noted for all three taxa after an unintended disturbance to the sample site that may have selected for more oxygen-tolerant phylotypes. When viewed from a coarse taxonomic level, our data support assertions that these chemoautotrophic groups are functionally redundant in terms of their core metabolic capabilities since they were simultaneously active under all incubation conditions. In contrast, the higher resolution of amplicon sequencing allowed us to reveal finer-scale differences in growth that likely reflect adaptation of physiologically-distinct subtypes to varying oxygen concentrations in situ. Despite this progress, we still know remarkably little about the factors that maintain genomic diversity and allow for stable co-existence among these three campylobacterial groups. Moving forward, we suggest that more subtle biological factors such as enzyme substrate specificity, motility, cell morphology, and tolerance to environmental stress should be more thoroughly investigated to better understand ecological niche differentiation at deep-sea hydrothermal vents.",

Proposed rules were piloted on 84 variants. We applied quantitative evidence calibration for several criteria using likelihood ratios based on the Bayesian framework.\n\nResultsSeven ACMG/AMP criteria were adopted without changes, ten were adopted with RYR1-specific modifications, and nine were dropped.

Of the 42 discordant variants, 23 were determined as true calls, summing-up to a truth set of 430 variants.

The possibility of using induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to model normal and diseased tissue in vitro from a simple blood sample will reshape drug discovery for chronic lung, monogenic and infectious diseases.\n\nMethodsWe devised a simple and reliable method that drives a blood sample reprogrammed into hiPSC subsequently differentiated within 45 days into air-liquid interface bronchial epithelium (iALI), through key developmental stages, definitive-endoderm (DE) and Ventralized-Anterior-Foregut-Endoderm (vAFE) cells.\n\nResultsReprogramming blood cells from one healthy and 3 COPD patients, and from skin-derived fibroblasts obtained in one PCD patient, succeeded in 100% of samples using Sendai viruses. Mean cell purity at DE and vAFE stages was greater than 80%, assessed by expression of CXCR4 and NKX2.1, avoiding the need of cell sorting. When transferred to ALI conditions, vAFE cells reliably differentiated within 4 weeks into bronchial epithelium with large zones covered by beating ciliated, basal, goblets, club cells and neuroendocrine cells as found in vivo. Benchmarking all culture conditions including hiPSCs adaptation to single-cell passaging, cell density and differentiation induction timing allowed for consistently producing iALI bronchial epithelium from the five hiPSC lines.\n\nConclusionsReliable reprogramming and differentiation of blood-derived hiPSCs into mature and functional iALI bronchial epithelium is ready for wider use and this will allow better understanding lung disease pathogenesis and accelerating the development of novel gene therapies and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "For HIV, the time since infection can be estimated from sequence data for acutely infected samples. One popular approach relies on the star-like nature of phylogenies generated under exponential population growth, and the resulting Poisson distribution of mutations away from the founding variant. However, real-world complications, such as APOBEC hypermutation and multiple-founder transmission, present a challenge to this approach, requiring data curation to remove these signals before reasonable timing estimates may be obtained.\n\nHere we suggest a simple alternative approach that derives the timing estimate not from the entire mutational spectrum but from the proportion of sequences that have no mutations. This can be approximated quickly and is robust to phenomena such as multiple founder transmission and APOBEC hypermutation. Our approach is Bayesian, and we adopt a conjugate prior to obtain closed form posterior distributions at negligible computational expense.\n\nUsing real data and simulations, we show that this approach provides accurate timing estimates and credible intervals without the inconvenience of data curation and is robust to complicating phenomena that can mislead existing approaches or cause them to fail entirely. For immediate use we provide an implementation via Google Sheets, which offers bulk analysis of multiple datasets, as well as more detailed individual-donor analyses. For inclusion in data processing pipelines we provide implementations in three languages: Julia, R, and Python.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic genomes are highly organised within the nucleus of a cell, allowing widely dispersed regulatory elements such as enhancers to interact with gene promoters through physical contacts in three-dimensional space. Recent chromosome conformation capture methodologies such as Hi-C have enabled the analysis of interacting regions of the genome providing a valuable insight into the three-dimensional organisation of the chromatin in the nucleus, including chromosome compartmentalisation and gene expression. Complicating the analysis of Hi-C data however is the massive amount of identified interactions, many of which do not directly drive gene function, thus hindering the identification of potentially biologically functional 3D interactions. In this review, we collate and examine the downstream analysis of Hi-C data with particular focus on methods that identify significant functional interactions. We classify three groups of approaches; structurally-associated domain discovery methods e.g. topologically-associated domains and compartments, detection of statistically significant interactions via background models, and the use of epigenomic data integration to identify functional interactions. Careful use of these three approaches is crucial to successfully identifying functional interactions within the genome.",

    "abstract": "Endocrine therapies are standard-of-care treatments for estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. However, patients with ER+ breast cancer develop resistance to these therapies and most relapsed patients die with endocrine-resistant metastatic disease. Here we show that resistance to the ER degrader, fulvestrant, is accompanied by epigenetic activation of the transcriptional co-activator VGLL1. Rewiring of the epigenome in therapy resistant cells also results in increased binding of the transcription factor TEAD4. Through interaction with TEAD4, VGLL1 induces the expression of genes implicated in cell proliferation in the resistant cells. We demonstrate that VGLL1 is necessary for the growth of fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cells. Pharmacological disruption of VGLL1/TEAD4 interaction blocked growth of fulvestrant-resistant cells, accompanied by inhibition of VGLL1/TEAD transcriptional programmes. Furthermore, we identify EGFR as an important downstream VGLL1 target, whereby VGLL1-directed EGFR upregulation sensitises fulvestrant-resistant breast cancer cells to EGFR inhibitors. Taken together, our findings identify VGLL1 as a key transcriptional driver in endocrine-resistant breast cancer and identify new therapeutic approaches for advanced breast cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsDaylength determines flowering dates. However, questions remain regarding flowering dates in the natural environment, such as the synchronous flowering of plants sown simultaneously at highly contrasting latitudes. The daily change in sunrise and sunset times is the cue for the flowering of trees and for the synchronisation moulting in birds at the equator. Sunrise and sunset also synchronise the cell circadian clock, which is involved in the regulation of flowering. The goal of this study was to update the photoperiodism model with knowledge acquired since its conception.\n\nMethodsA large dataset was gathered, including four 2-year series of monthly sowings of 28 sorghum varieties in Mali and two 1-year series of monthly sowings of eight rice varieties in the Philippines to compare with previously published monthly sowings in Japan and Malaysia, and data from sorghum breeders in France, Nicaragua, and Colombia. An additive linear model of the duration in days to panicle initiation (PI) using day length and daily changes in sunrise and sunset times was implemented.\n\nKey ResultsSimultaneous with the phyllochron, the duration to PI of field crops acclimated to the mean temperature at seedling emergence within the usual range of mean cropping temperatures. A unique additive linear model combining daylength and daily changes in sunrise and sunset hours was accurately fitted for any type of response in the duration to PI to the sowing date without any temperature input. Once calibrated on a complete and an incomplete monthly sowing series at two tropical latitudes, the model accurately predicted the duration to PI of the concerned varieties from the equatorial to the temperate zone.\n\nConclusionsThe results of the updated photoperiodism model strongly supported the hypothesis that photoperiodism could be a combined response to day length and daily changes in sunrise and sunset times.",

    "abstract": "Absence epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by abnormally synchronous electrical activity within two mutually connected brain regions, the thalamus and cortex, that results in seizures and affects more than 6.5 million people. Epilepsy is commonly studied through the use of the electroencephalogram (EEG), a device that monitors brain waves over time. In this study, we introduced machine learning models to predict epileptic seizures in two ways, one to train logistic regression models to provide an accurate decision boundary to predict based off frequency features, and second to train convolutional neural networks to predict based off spectral power images from EEG. This pipeline employed a two model approach, using logistic regression and convolutional neural networks to predict seizures. The evaluation, performed on data from 9 mice, achieved prediction accuracies of 98%. The proposed methodology introduces a novel aspect of looking at predicting absence seizures, which are known to be short events, in addition to the comparison between a time-dependent and time-agnostic seizure prediction classifier. The overall goal of these experiments were to build a model that can accurately predict whether or not a seizure will occur.",

    "abstract": "The Action Observation Network (AON) encompasses brain areas consistently engaged when we observe others actions. Although the core nodes of the AON are present from childhood, it is not known to what extent they are sensitive to different action features during development. As social cognitive abilities continue to mature during adolescence, the AON response to socially-oriented actions, but not to object-related actions, may differ in adolescents and adults. To test this hypothesis, we scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 28 typically-developing teenagers and 25 adults while they passively watched videos of hand actions varying along two dimensions: sociality (i.e. directed towards another person or not) and transitivity (i.e. involving an object or not). We found that observing actions recruited the same fronto-parietal and occipito-temporal regions in adults and adolescents. The modulation of voxelwise activity by the social or transitive nature of the action was similar in both groups of participants. Multivariate pattern analysis, however, revealed that the accuracy in decoding the social dimension from the brain activity patterns, increased with age in lateral occipital and parietal regions, known to be involved in semantic representations of actions, as well as in posterior superior temporal sulcus, a region commonly associated with perception of high level features necessary for social perception. Change in decoding the transitive dimension was observed only in the latter region. These findings indicate that the representation of others actions, and in particular their social dimensions, in the adolescent AON is still not as robust as in adults.\n\nSignificance statementThe activity of the action observation network in the human brain is modulated according to the purpose of the observed action, in particular the extent to which it involves interaction with an object or another person. How this conceptual representation of actions is implemented during development is largely unknown. Here, using multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data, we discovered that, while the action observation network is in place in adolescence, the fine-grain organization of its posterior regions is less robust than in adults to decode the social or transitive dimensions of an action. This finding highlights the late maturation of social processing in the human brain.",

However, due to lack of relevant models, the contribution of skin fibroblast sub-populations to vascularization remains unknown. We thus cultured human papillary and reticular fibroblasts as cell sheets. Differential transcriptomic analysis was performed by RNA sequencing to characterize their microenvironment. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that each fibroblast population expressed specific angiogenesis and matrisome gene expression signatures resulting in specific ECM that differed both in composition and structure. The impact of secreted and ECM-bound factors was then assessed using 3D angiogenesis assays. When co-cultivated with endothelial cells, the papillary and reticular microenvironments induced the formation of distinct capillary networks mimicking the characteristics of vasculature of native dermis subcompartments (vessel diameter and density, number of branch points). Whereas conditioned media of papillary fibroblasts displayed intrinsic high angiogenic potential, reticular ones only contributed to capillary formation induced by exogenous VEGF. These results show that skin fibroblast populations regulate angiogenesis via both secreted and ECM-bound factors. Our work emphasizes the importance of papillary and reticular fibroblasts, not only for modelling dermis microenvironment but also for its vascularization.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation of sea urchins can decimate macroalgal forests in coastal ecosystems, leading to persistent barren seascapes. While kelp forests are among the most productive ecosystems on the planet, productivity in these urchin barrens is dramatically reduced. Moreover, urchins inhabiting these food-depauperate barrens face starvation and many survive in these barrens for years or decades. Urchins in barrens can persist by eating food subsidies from drift algae, pelagic salps, tubeworms, as well as encrusting and filamentous algae, microbial mats, and slow-growing species resistant to herbivory. Despite both food from endogenous production and exogenous subsidies, many urchins in barrens likely experience prolonged food deprivation. This resource limitation may create a trade-off between reproduction and survival; for example, fecundity of purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) is 99.9% lower in barrens. Despite food constraints, red sea urchins (Mesocentrotus franciscanus), the dominant urchin species at our study sites, can live in excess of 100 years and barrens in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia (BC), Canada, have persisted for at least 143 years. While these phenomena are widespread and well documented, the bioenergetic adaptations that allow urchins to persist in these food-depauperate barrens remain poorly understood. To quantify habitat-specific differences in metabolic rates and energy reserves (as measured by gonadal mass), we conducted respirometry on and measured gonadal mass in M. franciscanus at three locations in BC inside and outside of adjacent kelp forest and barrens habitat. Here we demonstrate that M. franciscanus in barrens versus kelp forests have substantially lower energy reserves and, importantly, also exhibit dramatic reductions in size-specific resting metabolic rates (RMR), even after standardizing by metabolically active body mass. On average, gonadal mass was 44.6% lower and RMR scaled to metabolically active body mass was 40% lower in barrens urchins than in kelp forest urchins. Such a shift in metabolic rate may provide a mechanism that facilitates barren state stability over long time scales as M. franciscanus can lower energetic demands while they wait for small pulses of food, scrape by on low-productivity resources, and suppress recruitment of macroalgae for months, years, or decades.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) neuronal spheroid culture serves as a powerful model system for the investigation of neurological disorders and drug discovery. The success of such a model system requires techniques that enable high-resolution functional readout across the entire spheroid. Conventional microelectrode arrays and implantable neural probes cannot monitor the electrophysiology activity across the entire native 3D geometry of the cellular construct. Here, we demonstrate a 3D self-rolled biosensor array (3D-SR-BA) integrated with a 3D cortical spheroid culture for simultaneous in-vitro electrophysiology recording, functional Ca2+ imaging, and drug effect monitoring. We have also developed a signal processing pipeline to detect neural firings with high spatiotemporal resolution from the electrophysiology recordings based on established spike sorting methods. The 3D-SR-BAs cortical spheroid interface provides a stable, high sensitivity recording of neural action potentials (< 50 V peak-to-peak amplitude). The 3D-SR-BA is demonstrated as a potential drug screening platform through the investigation of the neural response to the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. Upon addition of glutamate, the neuronal firing rates increased notably corresponding well with the functional Ca2+ imaging. Our entire system, including the 3D-SR-BA integrated with neural spheroid culture, enables simultaneous electrophysiology recording and functional Ca2+ imaging with high spatiotemporal resolution in conjunction with chemical stimulation. We demonstrate a powerful toolset for future studies of tissue development, disease progression, and drug testing and screening, especially when combined with native spheroid cultures directly extracted from humans.",

    "abstract": "Protein structure prediction continues to stand as an unsolved problem in bioinformatics and biomedicine. Deep learning algorithms and the availability of metagenomic sequences have led to the development of new approaches to predict inter-residue distances--the key intermediate step. Different from the recently successful methods which frame the problem as a multi-class classification problem, this article introduces a real-valued distance prediction method REALDIST. Using a representative set of 43 thousand protein chains, a variant of deep ResNet is trained to predict real-valued distance maps. The contacts derived from the real-valued distance maps predicted by this method, on the most difficult CASP13 free-modeling protein datasets, demonstrate a long-range top-L precision of 52%, which is 17% higher than the top CASP13 predictor Raptor-X and slightly higher than the more recent trRosetta method. Similar improvements are observed on the CAMEO  hard and  very hard datasets. Three-dimensional (3D) structure prediction guided by real-valued distances reveals that for short proteins the mean accuracy of the 3D models is slightly higher than the top human predictor AlphaFold and server predictor Quark in the CASP13 competition.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms by which cells respond and adapt to oxidative stress are largely unknown but are key to developing a rationale for cancer therapies that target antioxidant pathways. APR-246 is a mutant-p53 targeted therapeutic currently under clinical investigation in myeloid dysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia1. Whilst the mechanism of action of APR-246 is thought to be reactivation of wild-type p53 activity through covalent modification of cysteine residues in the core domain of mutant-p53 protein2,3, here we report that the anti-neoplastic capacity of APR-246 lies predominantly in the conjugation of free cysteine. Genome-wide CRISPR perturbation screening, metabolite profiling and proteomics in response to APR-246 treatment in mutant-p53 cancer cells highlighted the role of GSH and mitochondrial metabolism in determining APR-246 efficacy. APR-246 sensitivity was increased through loss of key enzymes in mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism, SHMT2 and MTHFD1L, due to diminished glycine supply for de novo GSH synthesis. Critically, we show that APR-246 induces iron-dependent, apoptotic machinery-independent cell death, ferroptosis. Whole-cell proteomics analyses indicated an upregulation of proteins involved in iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis (eg. FDX1). GSH, acetyl-CoA and NADH levels were also depleted in APR-246 treated cells. Importantly, we found that APR-246 inhibits iron-sulfur cluster biogenesis in the mitochondria of cancer cells through cysteine conjugation. This work not only details novel determinants of APR-246 activity in cancer cells, but also provides a clinical roadmap for targeting antioxidant pathways in tumours - beyond targeting mutant-p53 tumours.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/398867v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11155f8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1231cb7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@324881org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@136146f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Sleep deprivation (SD) leads to impairments in cognitive function. Here, we tested the hypothesis that cognitive changes in the sleep-deprived brain can be explained by information processing within and between large-scale cortical networks. We acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of 20 healthy volunteers during attention and executive tasks following a regular night of sleep, a night of sleep deprivation, and a recovery nap containing non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Overall, sleep deprivation was associated with increased cortex-wide functional integration, driven by a rise of integration within cortical networks. The ratio of within vs between network integration in the cortex increased further in the recovery nap, suggesting that prolonged wakefulness drives the cortex toward a state resembling sleep. This balance of integration and segregation in the sleep-deprived state was tightly associated with deficits in cognitive performance. This was a distinct and better marker of cognitive impairment than conventional indicators of homeostatic sleep pressure, as well as the pronounced thalamo-cortical connectivity changes that occurs towards falling asleep. Importantly, restoration of the balance between segregation and integration of cortical activity was also related to performance recovery after the nap, demonstrating a bi-directional effect. These results demonstrate that intra- and inter-individual differences in cortical network integration and segregation during task performance may play a critical role in vulnerability to cognitive impairment in the sleep deprived state.\n\nSignificance StatementSleep deprivation has significant negative consequences for cognitive function. Understanding how changes in brain activity underpin changes in cognition is important not only to discover why performance declines following extended periods of wakefulness, but also for answering the fundamental question of why we require regular and recurrent sleep for optimal performance. Finding neural correlates that predict performance following sleep deprivation also has the potential to understand which individuals are particularly vulnerable to sleep deprivation, and what aspects of brain function may protect them from these negative consequences on performance. Finally, understanding how perturbations to regular (well-rested) brain functioning affect cognitive performance, will provide important insight into how underlying principles of information processing in the brain may support cognition generally.",

    "abstract": "Interactions of developing T cells with Aire+ medullary thymic epithelial cells expressing high levels of MHCII molecules (mTEChi) are critical for the induction of central tolerance. In turn, thymocytes regulate the cellularity of Aire+ mTEChi. However, it remains unknown whether thymocytes control Aire+ mTEChi-precursors that are contained in mTEClo cells or other mTEClo subsets that have recently been delineated or identified by single-cell transcriptomic analyses. Here, using three distinct transgenic mouse models, in which antigen-presentation between mTECs and CD4+ thymocytes is perturbed, we show by high-throughput RNA-seq that self-reactive CD4+ thymocytes induce in mTEClo the expression of tissue-restricted self-antigens, cytokines, chemokines and adhesion molecules important for T-cell development. This gene activation program is combined with a global increase of the active H3K4me3 histone mark. Finally, we show that these interactions induce key mTEC transcriptional regulators and govern mTEClo subset composition, including Aire+ mTEChi-precursors, post-Aire and tuft-like mTECs. Our genome-wide study thus reveals that self-reactive CD4+ thymocytes control multiple unsuspected facets from immature stages of mTECs, which determines their heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, toxin-producing anaerobe that can cause nosocomial antibiotic-associated intestinal disease. Although the production of toxin A (TcdA) and toxin B (TcdB) contribute to the main pathogenesis of C. difficile, the mechanism of TcdA and TcdB release from cell remains unclear. In this study, we identified and characterized a new cell wall hydrolase Cwl0971 (CDR20291_0971) from C. difficile R20291, which is involved in bacterial autolysis. The gene 0971 deletion mutant (R20291{Delta}0971) generated with CRISPR-AsCpfI exhibited significantly delayed cell autolysis and increased cell viability compared to R20291, and the purified Cwl0971 exhibited hydrolase activity for Bacillus subtilis cell wall. Meanwhile, 0971 gene deletion impaired TcdA and TcdB release due to the decreased cell autolysis in the stationary / late phase of cell growth. Moreover, sporulation of the mutant strain decreased significantly compared to the wild type strain. In vivo, the defect of Cwl0971 decreased fitness over the parent strain in a mouse infection model. Collectively, Cwl0971 is involved in cell wall lysis and cell viability, which affects toxin release, sporulation, germination, and pathogenicity of R20291, indicating that Cwl0971 could be an attractive target for C. difficile infection therapeutics and prophylactics.",

    "abstract": "An outstanding challenge in protein design is the design of binders against therapeutically relevant target proteins via scaffolding the discontinuous binding interfaces present in their often large and complex binding partners. There is currently no method for sampling through the almost unlimited number of possible protein structures for those capable of scaffolding a specified discontinuous functional site; instead, current approaches make the sampling problem tractable by restricting search to structures composed of pre-defined secondary structural elements. Such restriction of search has the disadvantage that considerable trial and error can be required to identify architectures capable of scaffolding an arbitrary discontinuous functional site, and only a tiny fraction of possible architectures can be explored. Here we build on recent advances in de novo protein design by deep network hallucination to develop a solution to this problem which eliminates the need to pre-specify the structure of the scaffolding in any way. We use the trRosetta residual neural network, which maps input sequences to predicted inter-residue distances and orientations, to compute a loss function which simultaneously rewards recapitulation of a desired structural motif and the ideality of the surrounding scaffold, and generate diverse structures harboring the desired binding interface by optimizing this loss function by gradient descent. We illustrate the power and versatility of the method by scaffolding binding sites from proteins involved in key signaling pathways with a wide range of secondary structure compositions and geometries. The method should be broadly useful for designing small stable proteins containing complex functional sites.",

    "abstract": "Although genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of markers associated with various complex traits and diseases, our ability to predict such phenotypes remains limited. A perhaps ignored explanation lies in the limitations of the genetic models and statistical techniques commonly used in association studies. However, using genotype data for individuals to perform accurate genetic prediction of complex traits can promote genomic selection in animal and plant breeding and can lead to the development of personalized medicine in humans. Because most complex traits have a polygenic architecture, accurate genetic prediction often requires modeling genetic variants together via polygenic methods. Here, we also utilize our proposed polygenic methods, which refer to as the iterative screen regression model (ISR) for genome prediction. We compared ISR with several commonly used prediction methods with simulations. We further applied ISR to predicting 15 traits, including the five species of cattle, rice, wheat, maize, and mice. The results of the study indicate that the ISR method performs well than several commonly used polygenic methods and stability.",

    "abstract": "For many species, parental care critically affects offspring survival. But what drives animals to display parental behaviours towards young? In mammals, pregnancy-induced physiological transformations seem key in preparing the neural circuits that lead towards attraction (and reduced-aggression) to young. Beyond mammalian maternal behaviour, knowledge of the neural mechanisms that underlie parental care is severely lacking. We took advantage of a domesticated bird species, the Japanese quail, for which parental behaviour towards chicks can be induced through a sensitization procedure, a process that is not effective in all animals. We used the variation in parental responses to study neural transcriptomic changes associated with the sensitization procedure itself and with the outcome of the procedure (i.e., presence of parental behaviours). Out of the brain regions studied, we found that most differences in gene expression were located in the hypothalamus. Two genes identified are of particular interest, as no role in avian parental care was known for those genes. One is neurotensin, previously only demonstrated to be causally associated with maternal care in mammals. The other one is urocortin 3, causally demonstrated to affect young-directed neglect and aggression in mammals. Our work opens new avenues of research into understanding the neural basis of parental care in non-placental species.",
