    "abstract": "Little is known about extracellular matrix (ECM) contributions to formation of the earliest cell lineages in the embryo. Here, we show that the proteoglycan versican and glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan are associated with emerging Flk1+ hematoendothelial progenitors at gastrulation. The mouse versican mutant Vcanhdf lacks yolk sac vasculature, with attenuated yolk sac hematopoiesis. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Vcan inactivation in mouse embryonic stem cells reduced vascular endothelial and hematopoietic differentiation in embryoid bodies, which generated fewer blood colonies, and had an impaired angiogenic response to VEGF165. HA was severely depleted in Vcanhdf embryos, with corresponding increase in the HA-depolymerase TMEM2. Conversely, HA-deficient mouse embryos also had vasculogenic suppression but with increased versican proteolysis. VEGF165 and Indian hedgehog, crucial vasculogenic factors, utilized the versican-HA matrix, specifically versican chondroitin sulfate chains, for binding. Versican-HA ECM is an obligate requirement for vasculogenesis and primitive hematopoiesis, acts as an vasculogenic factor-enriching microniche for Flk1+ progenitors from their origin at gastrulation.",

    "abstract": "Natural selection is a significant driver of speciation. Yet it remains largely unknown whether local adaptation can drive speciation through the evolution of hybrid sterility between populations. Here, we show that adaptive divergence in shoot gravitropism, the ability of a plants shoot to bend upwards in response to the downward pull of gravity, contributes to the evolution of hybrid sterility in an Australian wildflower, Senecio lautus. We find that shoot gravitropism has evolved multiple times in association with plant height between adjacent populations inhabiting contrasting environments, suggesting that these traits have evolved by natural selection. We directly tested this prediction using a hybrid population subjected to eight rounds of recombination and three rounds of selection in the field. It revealed that shoot gravitropism responds to natural selection in the expected direction of the locally adapted population. This provided an ideal platform to test whether genetic differences in gravitropism contribute to hybrid sterility in S. lautus. Using this advanced hybrid population, we discovered that crossing individuals with extreme differences in gravitropism reduce their ability to produce seed by 21%, providing strong evidence that this adaptive trait is genetically correlated with hybrid sterility. Our results suggest that natural selection can drive the evolution of locally adaptive traits that also create hybrid sterility, thus indicating an evolutionary connection between local adaptation and the origin of new species.\n\nSignificance statementNew species originate as populations become reproductively isolated from one another. Despite recent progress in uncovering the genetic basis of reproductive isolation, it remains unclear whether intrinsic reproductive barriers, such as hybrid sterility, evolve as a by-product of local adaptation to contrasting environments or evolve through non-ecological processes, such as meiotic drive. Here, we show that differences in a plants response to the pull of gravity have repeatedly evolved amongst coastal populations of an Australian wildflower, thus implicating a role of natural selection in their evolution. We found a strong genetic correlation between variation in this adaptive trait and hybrid sterility, suggesting that intrinsic reproductive barriers contribute to the origin of new species as populations adapt to heterogeneous environments.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA)-based therapies are an emerging class of targeted therapeutics with many potential applications. Ewing Sarcoma patients could benefit dramatically from personalized miRNA therapy due to inter-patient heterogeneity and a lack of druggable (to this point) targets. However, because of the broad effects miRNAs may have on different cells and tissues, trials of miRNA therapies have struggled due to severe toxicity and unanticipated immune response. In order to overcome this hurdle, a network science-based approach is well-equipped to evaluate and identify miRNA candidates and combinations of candidates for the repression of key oncogenic targets while avoiding repression of essential housekeeping genes. We first characterized 6 Ewing sarcoma cell lines using mRNA sequencing. We then estimated a measure of tumor state, which we term network potential, based on both the mRNA gene expression and the underlying protein-protein interaction network in the tumor. Next, we ranked mRNA targets based on their contribution to network potential. We then identified miRNAs and combinations of miRNAs that preferentially act to repress mRNA targets with the greatest influence on network potential. Our analysis identified TRIM25, APP, ELAV1, RNF4, and HNRNPL as ideal mRNA targets for Ewing sarcoma therapy. Using predicted miRNA-mRNA target mappings, we identified miR-3613-3p, let-7a-3p, miR-300, miR-424-5p, and let-7b-3p as candidate optimal miRNAs for preferential repression of these targets. Ultimately, our work, as exemplified in the case of Ewing sarcoma, describes a novel pipeline by which personalized miRNA cocktails can be designed to maximally perturb gene networks contributing to cancer progression.\n\nAuthor SummaryPrecision medicine in cancer aims to find the right treatment, for the right patient, at the right time. Substantial variation between patient tumors, even of the same disease site, has limited the application of precision medicine in the clinic. In this study, we present novel computational tools for the identification of targets for cancer therapy using widely available sequencing data. We used a network-science based approach that leveraged multiple types of omic data to identify functionally relevant disease targets. Further, we developed algorithms to identify potential miRNA-based therapies that inhibit these predicted disease targets. We applied this pipeline to a novel Ewing Sarcoma transcriptomics data-set as well as publicly available patient data from the St. Jude Cloud. We identified a number of promising therapeutic targets for this rare disease, including EWSR1, the proposed driver of Ewing Sarcoma development. These novel data and methods will provide researchers with new tools for the development of precision medicine treatments in a variety of cancer systems.",

    "abstract": "Metacognition as the capacity of monitoring ones own cognition operates across domains. Here, we addressed whether metacognition in different cognitive domains rely on common or distinct neural substrates with combined diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. After acquiring DTI and resting-state fMRI data, we asked participants to perform a temporal-order memory task and a perceptual discrimination task, followed by trial-specific confidence judgments. DTI analysis revealed that the structural integrity (indexed by fractional anisotropy) in the anterior portion of right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) was associated with both perceptual and mnemonic metacognitive abilities. Using perturbed mnemonic metacognitive scores produced by inhibiting the precuneus using TMS, the mnemonic metacognition scores did not correlate with individuals SLF structural integrity anymore, revealing the relevance of this tract in memory metacognition. In order to further verify the involvement of several cortical regions connected by SLF, we took the TMS-targeted precuneus region as a seed in a functional connectivity analysis and found the functional connectivity between precuneus and two SLF-connected regions (inferior parietal cortex and precentral gyrus) differentially mediated mnemonic but not perceptual metacognition performance. These results illustrate the importance of SLF and a putative white-matter grey-matter circuitry that supports human metacognition.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which nonhuman primate vocalizations are amenable to modification through experience is relevant for understanding the substrate from which human speech evolved. We examined the vocal behaviour of Guinea baboons, Papio papio, ranging in the Niokolo Koba National Park in Senegal. Guinea baboons live in a multi-level society, with units nested within parties nested within gangs. We investigated whether the acoustic structure of grunts of 27 male baboons of two gangs varied with party/gang membership and genetic relatedness. Males in this species are philopatric, resulting in increased male relatedness within gangs and parties. Grunts from members were more similar within than across social levels (N = 351 dyads for comparison within and between gangs, and N = 169 dyads within and between parties), but the effect sizes were small. Yet, acoustic similarity did not correlate with genetic relatedness, suggesting that higher amounts of social interactions rather than genetic relatedness promote the observed vocal convergence. We consider this convergence a result of sensory-motor integration and suggest this to be an implicit form of vocal learning shared with humans, in contrast to the goal-directed and intentional explicit form of vocal learning unique to human speech acquisition.",

Recently described GLP-1 receptor agonists showing signal bias in favour of cyclic AMP over {beta}-arrestin-2 recruitment have delivered promising results in preclinical studies. Here we first sought to establish the role of {beta}-arrestins in the control of intracellular signalling and trafficking responses at the closely related GLP-1, GIP and GCG receptors, through studies performed in cells depleted of both {beta}-arrestin isoforms. We also generated analogues of GLP-1, GCG and GIP which in some cases showed selective reduction in {beta}-arrestin-2 recruitment versus cAMP signalling compared to the parent peptide. Despite reduced acute signalling potency and/or efficacy, some biased GLP-1 and GIP analogues increased maximal sustained insulin secretion from INS-1 832/3 clonal beta cells, although only at high agonist concentrations. Biased GCG analogues did not affect maximal insulin release, or glucose output in hepatocytes.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory-derived temperature dependencies of life history traits are increasingly being used to make mechanistic predictions for how climatic warming will affect vector-borne disease dynamics, partially by affecting abundance dynamics of the vector population. These temperature-trait relationships are typically estimated from populations reared on optimal resource supply, even though natural populations of vectors are expected to experience variation in resource supply, including intermittent resource limitation. Using laboratory experiments on the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a principal arbovirus vector, combined with stage-structured population modelling, we show that low-resource supply significantly depresses the vectors maximal population growth rate across the entire temperature range (22-32{degrees}C) and causes it to peak at a lower temperature than at high-resource supply. This effect is primarily driven by an increase in juvenile mortality and development time, combined with an exaggerated decrease in adult size with temperature at low-resource supply. Our study suggests that projections of vector abundance and disease transmission based on laboratory studies are likely to substantially underestimate how resource supply can modulate the temperature-dependency of population-level fitness through its influence on juvenile survival and development time. Our results provide compelling evidence for future studies to consider resource supply when predicting the effects of climate and habitat change on disease vectors and transmission.",

Dietary interventions can reverse metabolic declines and slow aging, although compliance issues remain paramount. 17-estradiol treatment improves metabolic parameters and slows aging in male mice. The mechanisms by which 17-estradiol elicits these benefits remain unresolved. Herein, we show that 17-estradiol elicits similar genomic binding and transcriptional activation through estrogen receptor  (ER) to that of 17{beta}-estradiol. In addition, we show that the ablation of ER completely attenuates the beneficial metabolic effects of 17-E2 in male mice. Our findings suggest that 17-E2 acts primarily through the liver and hypothalamus to improve metabolic parameters in male mice. Lastly, we also determined that 17-E2 improves metabolic parameters in male rats, thereby proving that the beneficial effects of 17-E2 are not limited to mice. Collectively, these studies suggest ER may be a drug target for mitigating chronic diseases in male mammals.",

Timely regulation of the switch, operated by several transcription factors, is fundamental for allowing coordinated interactions between neurons and glia. We deleted the gene for one such factor, SOX9, early during mouse brain development and observed a significantly compromised dentate gyrus (DG). We dissected the origin of the defect, targeting embryonic Sox9 deletion to either the DG neuronal progenitor domain or the adjacent cortical hem (CH). We identified in the latter previously uncharacterized ALDH1L1+ astrocytic progenitors, which form a fimbrial-specific glial scaffold necessary for neuronal progenitor migration towards the developing DG. Our results highlight an early crucial role of SOX9 for DG development through regulation of astroglial potential acquisition in the CH. Moreover, we illustrate how formation of a local network, amidst astrocytic and neuronal progenitors originating from adjacent domains, underlays brain morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN) is a prominent intrinsic network that is observable in many mammalian brains. However, few studies have investigated the temporal dynamics of this network based on direct physiological recordings. Herein, we addressed this issue by characterizing the dynamics of local field potentials (LFPs) from the rat DMN during wakefulness and sleep with an exploratory analysis. We constructed a novel coactive micropattern (CAMP) algorithm to evaluate the configurations of rat DMN dynamics and further revealed the relationship between DMN dynamics with different wakefulness and alertness levels. From the gamma activity (40-80 Hz) in the DMN across wakefulness and sleep, three spatially stable CAMPs were detected: a common low-activity level micropattern (cDMN), an anterior high-activity level micropattern (aDMN) and a posterior high-activity level micropattern (pDMN). A dynamic balance across CAMPs emerged during wakefulness and was disrupted in sleep stages. In the slow-wave sleep (SWS) stage, cDMN became the primary activity pattern, whereas aDMN and pDMN were the major activity patterns in the rapid eye movement sleep (REM) stage. Additionally, further investigation revealed phasic relationships between CAMPs and the up-down states of the slow DMN activity in the SWS stage. Our study revealed that the dynamic configurations of CAMPs were highly associated with different stages of wakefulness and provided a potential three-state model to describe the DMN dynamics for wakefulness and alertness.\n\nImpact StatementIn the current study, a novel coactive micropattern method (CAMP) was developed to elucidate fast DMN dynamics during wakefulness and sleep. Our findings demonstrated that the dynamic configurations of DMN activity are specific to different wakefulness stages and provided a three-state DMN CAMP model to depict wakefulness levels, thus revealing a potentially new neurophysiological representation of alertness levels. This work could elucidate the DMN dynamics underlying different stages of wakefulness and have important implications for the theoretical understanding of the neural mechanism of wakefulness and alertness.",

    "abstract": "Both normal ageing and neurodegenerative diseases cause morphological changes to the brain. Age-related brain changes are subtle, nonlinear, and spatially and temporally heterogenous, both within a subject and across a population. Machine learning models are particularly suited to capture these patterns and can produce a model that is sensitive to changes of interest, despite the large variety in healthy brain appearance. In this paper, the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the rich UK Biobank dataset, the largest database currently available, are harnessed to address the problem of predicting brain age. We developed a 3D CNN architecture to predict chronological age, using a training dataset of 12, 802 T1-weighted MRI images and a further 6, 885 images for testing. The proposed method shows competitive performance on age prediction, but, most importantly, the CNN prediction errors {Delta}BrainAge = AgePredicted - AgeTrue correlated significantly with many clinical measurements from the UK Biobank in the female and male groups. In addition, having used images from only one imaging modality in this experiment, we examined the relationship between {Delta}BrainAge and the image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) from all other imaging modalities in the UK Biobank, showing correlations consistent with known patterns of ageing. Furthermore, we show that the use of nonlinearly registered images to train CNNs can lead to the network being driven by artefacts of the registration process and missing subtle indicators of ageing, limiting the clinical relevance. Due to the longitudinal aspect of the UK Biobank study, in the future it will be possible to explore whether the {Delta}BrainAge from models such as this network were predictive of any health outcomes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBrain age is estimated using a 3D CNN from 12,802 full T1-weighted images.\nC_LIO_LIRegions used to drive predictions are different for linearly and nonlinearly registered data.\nC_LIO_LILinear registrations utilise a greater diversity of biologically meaningful areas.\nC_LIO_LICorrelations with IDPs and non-imaging variables are consistent with other publications.\nC_LIO_LIExcluding subjects with various health conditions had minimal impact on main correlations.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "RationaleThe rupture of the fibrous cap in atherosclerotic lesions is the underlying cause of most thrombi leading to heart attack and a frequent cause of stroke. Caps are produced by smooth muscle cells (SMCs) that are recruited to the subendothelial space. We hypothesized that the recruitment mechanisms are likely common to embryonic artery development, which relies prominently on Notch signaling to form the subendothelial layers of medial SMCs.\n\nObjectiveTo analyze the causal roles of the Notch signaling pathway in SMCs for atherogenesis and cap formation.\n\nMethods and ResultsNotch elements involved in arterial media development were found expressed in regions of fibrous cap in mouse plaques. To assess the causal role of Notch signaling in cap formation, we studied atherosclerosis in mice in which the Notch pathway was inactivated specifically in SMCs by conditional knockout of the essential effector transcription factor RBPJ. No major effects were observed on plaque size, but the presence of cap SMCs was significantly reduced. Lineage tracing revealed that the accumulation of SMC-derived plaque cells in the cap region was unaltered but that Notch-defective cells failed to re-acquire the SMC phenotype in the cap. To analyze whether the accumulation of SMC-derived cells in atherogenesis requires down-regulation of Notch signaling, we studied atherosclerosis in mice with constitutive Notch signaling in SMCs achieved by conditional expression of the Notch intracellular domain. Forced Notch signaling inhibited the ability of medial SMCs to contribute to plaque cells, including both cap SMCs and osteochondrogenic cells, and significantly reduced atherosclerosis development.\n\nConclusionsSequential loss and gain of Notch signaling is needed to build the cap SMC population. The shared mechanisms with embryonic arterial media assembly suggest that the fibrous cap forms as a neo-media that restores the connection between endothelium and stabilizing SMCs, which is transiently disrupted by atherogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about how neural representations of natural sounds differ across species. For example, speech and music play a unique role in human hearing, yet it is unclear how auditory representations of speech and music differ between humans and other animals. Using functional Ultrasound imaging, we measured responses in ferrets to a set of natural and spectrotemporally-matched synthetic sounds previously tested in humans. Ferrets showed similar lower-level frequency and modulation tuning to that observed in humans. But while humans showed prominent selectivity for natural vs. synthetic speech and music in non-primary regions, ferret responses to natural and synthetic sounds were closely matched throughout primary and non-primary auditory cortex, even when tested with ferret vocalizations. This finding reveals that auditory representations in humans and ferrets diverge sharply at late stages of cortical processing, potentially driven by higher-order processing demands in speech and music.",

    "abstract": "This report presents multi-genomes and experimental evidence that REC protein family expansion occurs when the emergence of new pathways give rise to functional discordance. Specificity between REC-domain containing response regulators with paired histidine kinases are under negative purifying selection, constrained by the presence of other bacterial two-component systems signaling cascades that share sequence and structural identity. Presuming that the two-component systems can evolve by neutral drift when these constraints are relaxed, how might the REC protein family expand when constraints remain intact? Using an unsupervised machine learning approach to observe the sequence landscape of REC domains across long phylogenetic distances, we find that within-gene-recombination, a subcategory of gene conversion, switched the effector domain, and consequently the regulatory context of a duplicated response regulator from transcriptional regulation by {sigma}54 to {sigma}70. We determined that the recombined response regulator diverged from its parent by positive episodic diversifying selection, giving rise to two new residues. Functional experiments of the parent of recombined response regulators in our model system, Pseudomonas putida KT2440, revealed that the parent and recombined response regulators sense and respond to carboxylic acids and that the two new residues in the recombined regulator form a new interaction interface and prevent crosstalk. Overall, our study finds genetic perturbations can create conditions of functional discordance, whereby the REC protein family can evolve by positive diversifying selection.",

    "abstract": "Universal target enrichment kits maximise utility across wide evolutionary breadth while minimising the number of baits required to create a cost-efficient kit. Locus assembly requires a target reference, but the taxonomic breadth of the kit means that target references files can be phylogenetically sparse. The Angiosperms353 kit has been successfully used to capture loci throughout angiosperms but includes sequence information from 6-18 taxa per locus. Consequently, reads sequenced from on-target DNA molecules may fail to map to references, resulting in fewer on-target reads for assembly, reducing locus recovery. We expanded the Angiosperms353 target file, incorporating sequences from 566 transcriptomes to produce a  mega353 target file, with each gene represented by 17-373 taxa. This mega353 file is a drop-in replacement for the original Angiosperms353 file in HybPiper analyses. We provide tools to subsample the file based on user-selected taxon groups, and to incorporate other transcriptome or protein-coding gene datasets. Compared to the default Angiosperms353 file, the mega353 file increased the percentage of on-target reads by an average of 31%, increased loci recovery at 75% length by 61.9%, and increased the total length of the concatenated loci by 30%.

    "abstract": "Genomic manipulation is a useful approach for elucidating the molecular pathways underlying aspects of development, physiology, and behaviour. However, a lack of gene-editing tools appropriated for use in reef fishes has meant the genetic underpinnings for many of their unique traits remain to be investigated. One iconic group of reef fishes ideal for applying this technique are anemonefishes (Amphiprioninae) as they are widely studied for their symbiosis with anemones, sequential hermaphroditism, complex social hierarchies, skin pattern development, and vision, and are raised relatively easily in aquaria. In this study, we developed a gene-editing protocol for applying the CRISPR/Cas9 system in the false clown anemonefish, Amphiprion ocellaris. Microinjection of eggs at the one-cell stage was used to demonstrate the successful use of our CRISPR/Cas9 approach at two separate target sites: the rhodopsin-like 2B opsin encoding gene (RH2B) involved in vision, and Tyrosinase-producing gene (tyr) involved in the production of melanin. Analysis of the sequenced target gene regions in A. ocellaris embryos showed that uptake was as high as 50% of injected eggs. Further analysis of the subcloned mutant gene sequences revealed that our approach had a 75% to 100% efficiency in producing biallelic mutations in G0 A. ocellaris embryos. Moreover, we clearly show a loss-of-function in tyr mutant embryos which exhibited typical hypomelanistic phenotypes. This protocol is intended as a useful resource for future experimental studies that aim to elucidate gene function in anemonefishes and reef fishes in general.",

Combining the data from the different scanners is vital for increased statistical power; however, this leads to an increase in variance due to nonbiological factors such as the differences in acquisition protocols and hardware, which can mask signals of interest.\n\nWe propose a deep learning based training scheme, inspired by domain adaptation techniques, which uses an iterative update approach to aim to create scanner-invariant features while simultaneously maintaining performance on the main task of interest, thus reducing the influence of scanner on network predictions. We demonstrate the framework for regression, classification and segmentation tasks with two different network architectures.\n\nWe show that not only can the framework harmonise many-site datasets but it can also adapt to many data scenarios, including biased datasets and limited training labels. Finally, we show that the framework can be extended for the removal of other known confounds in addition to scanner.

To identify host factors required for flavivirus infection we performed full-genome loss of function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Based on these results we focused our efforts on characterizing the roles that TMEM41B and VMP1 play in the virus replication cycle. Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of the Flaviviridae family that we tested require TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional virus families and found that SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronaviridae also required TMEM41B for infection. Remarkably, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present at nearly twenty percent in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection. Based on our mechanistic studies we hypothesize that TMEM41B is recruited to flavivirus RNA replication complexes to facilitate membrane curvature, which creates a protected environment for viral genome replication.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSTMEM41B and VMP1 are required for both autophagy and flavivirus infection, however, autophagy is not required for flavivirus infection.\n\nTMEM41B associates with viral proteins and likely facilitates membrane remodeling to establish viral RNA replication complexes.\n\nTMEM41B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present at nearly twenty percent in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection.\n\nTMEM41B-deficient cells display an exaggerated innate immune response upon high multiplicity flavivirus infection.",

    "abstract": "Birth-death stochastic processes are the foundation of many phylogenetic models and are widely used to make inferences about epidemiological and macroevolutionary dynamics. There are a large number of birth-death model variants that have been developed; these impose different assumptions about the temporal dynamics of the parameters and about the sampling process. As each of these variants was individually derived, it has been difficult to understand the relationships between them as well as their precise biological and mathematical assumptions. Without a common mathematical foundation, deriving new models is non-trivial. Here we unify these models into a single framework, prove that many previously developed epidemiological and macroevolutionary models are all special cases of a more general model, and illustrate the connections between these variants. This framework centers around a technique for deriving likelihood functions for arbitrarily complex birth-death(-sampling) models that will allow researchers to explore a wider array of scenarios than was previously possible. We then use this frame-work to derive general model likelihoods for both the \"single-type\" case in which all lineages diversify according to the same process and the \"multi-type\" case, where there is variation in the process among lineages. By re-deriving existing single-type birth-death sampling models we clarify and synthesize the range of explicit and implicit assumptions made by these models.",

Here we present the first database of chromosome counts for animals (the Animal Chromosome Count database, ACC) summarizing chromosome numbers for [~]18,000 species. We found remarkable similarity in the distribution of chromosome counts between animals and flowering plants. At larger timescales, selection towards a specific range might explain the similar distribution of chromosome counts between these two groups. Nevertheless, changes in chromosome number are still potential drivers of divergence among species at shorter timescales. We also found that while animals and plants exhibit similar frequencies of speciation-related changes in chromosome number, plant speciation is more often related to changes in ploidy. Based on the ACC, our analyses suggest that changes in chromosome number alone could help explain patterns of diversity within animal clades.",

Here, we show that intestinal inflammation correlates with loss of LHPP, in DSS-treated mice and in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. Increased histidine phosphorylation was observed in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), as determined by pHis immunofluorescence staining of colon samples from a colitis mouse model. However, ablation of Lhpp did not cause increased pHis or promote intestinal inflammation in physiological conditions or after DSS treatment. Our observations suggest that increased histidine phosphorylation plays a role in colitis, but loss of LHPP is not sufficient to increase pHis or to cause inflammation in the intestine.",

    "abstract": "Exon skipping is a disease modifying therapy that operates at the RNA level. In this strategy, oligonucleotide analog drugs are used to specifically mask specific exons and prevent them from inclusion in the mature mRNA. Of course, this also results in loss of the corresponding region from the cognate protein, which is one possible therapeutic aim. Exon skipping can also be used to restore protein expression in cases where a genetic frameshift mutation has occurred, and this how it is applied to Duchenne muscular dystrophy, DMD. DMD most commonly arises as a result of large exonic deletions that juxtapose flanking exons of incompatible reading frame in the dystrophin gene, creating a frameshift and abolishing protein expression. Loss of dystrophin protein leads to the pathology of the disease, which is severe, causing death generally in the second or third decade of life. Here, the primary aim of exon skipping is the restoration of the reading frame by skipping an exon adjacent to the patients original defect. However, the therapeutically expressed protein is of course edited, and missing both the region of the underlying genetic defect, as well as the therapeutically skipped exon. While restoring some protein expression is good, how removing some region from the middle of a protein effects its structure and function is unclear. Complicating this in the case of DMD is the fact that the dystrophin gene is very large, containing 79 exons. Many different underlying deletions are known, and exon skipping can be applied in many ways. It has previously been shown that many exon-skip edits result in structural perturbations of varying degrees. What has been unclear is whether and how exon editing can be done to minimize these perturbations. In this study we examine a systematic and comprehensive panel of possible exon edits in a region of the dystrophin protein, and identify for the first time, exon edits that appear to maintain structural stability similar to wildtype protein. We also identify factors that appear to be correlated with the degree of structural perturbation, such as the number of cooperative protein domains, as well as how the underlying exon structure interacts with the protein domain structure.",

High-performance flexible platforms that allow seamless integration with soft tissue systems for such applications are urgently needed. Here, silver nanowires (Ag NWs)-based transparent microelectrodes and interconnects are designed to meet this demand. The Ag NWs percolating networks are patterned on flexible polymer substrates using an innovative photolithography-based solution-processing technique. The resulting nanowire networks exhibit a high average optical transparency of 76.1-90.0% over the visible spectrum, low normalized electrochemical impedance of 3.4-15 {Omega} cm2 at 1 kHz which is even better than those of opaque solid Ag films, superior sheet resistance of 11-25 {Omega} sq-1, excellent mechanical stability up to 10,000 bending cycles, good biocompatibility and chemical stability. Studies on Langendorff-perfused mouse and rat hearts demonstrate that the Ag NWs microelectrodes enable high-fidelity real-time monitoring of heart rhythm during co-localized optogenetic pacing and optical mapping with negligible light-induced electrical artifacts. This proof-of-concept work illustrates that the solution-processed, transparent, and flexible Ag NWs networks are a promising candidate for the next-generation of large-area multifunctional biointerfaces for interrogating complex biological systems in basic and translational research.",

We find that glioblastoma in older patients and older mice displayed reduced neuronal signaling, including a decline of NTRK-like family member 6 (SLITRK6), a receptor for neurotrophic factor BDNF. This reduction was linked to the systemic decline of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) with aging, as old mice exposed to young blood via parabiosis or supplemented with the NAD+ precursor NMN (nicotinamide mononucleotide) reverted phenotypically to young-brain responses to glioma, with reactivated neuronal signaling and reduced death from tumor burden. Interestingly, the phenotypic reversal by NMN was largely absent in old mice undergoing parabiosis with BDNF+/- young mice and in BDNF+/- mice undergoing tumor challenge, supporting the notion that the lower NAD+-BDNF signaling in the aging brain aggravated glioma tumorigenesis. We propose that the aging-associated decline in brain NAD+ worsens glioma outcomes at least in part by decreasing neuronal/synaptic activity and increasing neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technologies measure the interaction frequency between pairs of chromatin regions within the nucleus in a cell or a population of cells. Some of these 3C technologies retrieve interactions involving non-contiguous sets of loci, resulting in sparse interaction matrices. One of such 3C technologies is Promoter Capture Hi-C (pcHi-C) that is tailored to probe only interactions involving gene promoters. As such, pcHi-C provides sparse interaction matrices that are suitable to characterise short- and long-range enhancer-promoter interactions. Here, we introduce a new method to reconstruct the chromatin structural (3D) organisation from sparse 3C-based datasets such as pcHi-C. Our method allows for data normalisation, detection of significant interactions, and reconstruction of the full 3D organisation of the genomic region despite of the data sparseness. Specifically, it produces reliable reconstructions, in line with the ones obtained from dense interaction matrices, with as low as the 2-3% of the data from the matrix. Furthermore, the method is sensitive enough to detect cell-type-specific 3D organisational features such as the formation of different networks of active gene communities.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial flagellar MS ring is a transmembrane complex acting as the core of the flagellar motor. It not only acts as the template for rod and C ring assembly but also houses the type III protein export gate for assembly of the rod, hook and filament. The cytoplasmic C ring, involved in torque generation and rotation switch, is directly attached to the MS ring, and a symmetry mismatch between 26-fold MS ring and 34-fold C ring had been a long puzzle as to whether this would play some role in motor function. Although this puzzle seemed to have been resolved by the recent high-resolution structure of the MS ring with 33-fold symmetry with a variation from 32-fold to 35-fold because the C ring also shows a similar symmetry variation, it still remained ambiguous whether their symmetries are matched in the native motor structure. Here we show that the native MS ring structure formed by full-length FliF is 34-fold with no symmetry variation whereas the C ring has a small symmetry variation, indicating a flexibility in C ring assembly to generate small symmetry mismatches. We also show two conformations of FliF in part of its periplasmic region to form the 34-subunit ring with 23-fold and 11-fold subsymmetries in the inner and middle M ring, respectively, to accommodate the export gate at the center of the M ring.",

    "abstract": "Electroactive microorganisms play a significant role in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). These devices, which are based on a wide microbial diversity, can convert a large array of organic matter components into sustainable and renewable energy. At present, electricity-producing microorganisms are mostly isolated from sewage, anaerobic sediments and soil, however, the sources are very limited. For a more comprehensive understanding of the electron transfer mechanism of the electricity-producing microorganisms and the interaction with the environment, it is necessary to obtain a thorough understanding of their resource distribution and discover potential resources. In this study, plant tissues were selected to isolate endophytic bacteria, and the electrochemical activity potential of those bacteria was evaluated by high-throughput screening with a WO3 nanoprobe. Twenty-six strains of endophytic bacteria were isolated from plant tissues belonging to Angelica and Sweet Potato, of which 17 strains from 6 genera had electrochemical activity, including Bacillus sp., Pleomorphomonas sp., Rahnella sp., Shinella sp., Paenibacillus sp. and Staphylococcus sp.. Moreover, the electricity-producing microorganisms in the plant tissue are enriched. Microbial community analysis by high-throughput sequence indicated that Pseudomonas and Clostridioides are the dominant genera of MFC anode inoculated with angelica tissue.Staphylococcus and Lachnoclostridium 5 are the dominant genera in MFC anode inoculated with sweet potato tissue. And the most representative Gram-positive strain Staphylococcus succinus subsp. succinus H6 and plant tissue-inoculated MFC were further analyzed for electrochemical activity. After nearly 1500 h of voltage monitoring and cyclic voltammetry analysis, the results showed that a strain numbered H6 and plant tissue-inoculated MFC had a good electrogenerating activity.\n\nImportanceSome biological characteristics of microorganisms are inextricably linked to their living environment. For plant endophytes, some of their biological characteristics have a profound impact on the host. The discovery of the production of electrobacteria in plants helps us to understand the interaction between microorganisms and plants more deeply. For example, there may be intercellular electron transfer between the internally producing bacteria and nitrogen-fixing bacteria to improve the efficiency of nitrogen fixation. In addition, there may be a connection between the weak electrical signal of the plant and the the endophytic electricity-producing microorganismsThe discovery of electricity-producing bacteria in plants also brings a more comprehensive understanding of the distribution of electricity-producing microbial resources and the mechanism of origin.",

    "abstract": "Dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia (DCMA) syndrome is a rare mitochondrial disorder caused by mutations in the poorly understood DNAJC19 gene. The clinical presentation of DCMA is very diverse with symptoms ranging from mild cardiac dysfunction to intractable heart failure leading to death in early childhood. Although several lines of evidence indicate that DCMA symptoms are linked to mitochondrial function, the molecular underpinnings of this disease are unclear and there is no way to predict which patients are at risk for developing life-threatening symptoms. To address this we developed a metabolic flux assay for assessing the metabolic function of mitochondria in dermal fibroblasts derived from DCMA patients. Using this approach we discovered that fibroblasts from patients with DCMA showed elevated glutamine uptake, increased glutamate and ammonium secretion, and elevated lactate production when compared to controls. Moreover, the magnitude of these metabolic perturbations was closely correlated with patient cardiac dysfunction. This clinical/metabolic correlation was confirmed in a second blinded cohort of DCMA fibroblasts. Moreover, our metabolic flux diagnostic strategy correctly differentiated severe from mild DCMA cases with only one incorrect patient classification (positive predictive value 1.0 and negative predictive value 0.83). These findings suggest that glutamine catabolism is abnormal in DCMA and may serve as an early biomarker for predicting clinical progression.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAlterations in glutamine and lactate metabolism in patient-derived dermal fibroblasts are associated with the severity of cardiomyopathy in DCMA.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has highlighted the urgent need for effective preventive vaccination to reduce burden and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in humans. Intranasal vaccination is an attractive strategy to prevent COVID-19 as the nasal mucosa represents the first-line barrier to SARS-CoV-2 entry before viral spread to the lung. Although SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is rapidly progressing, the current intramuscular vaccines are designed to elicit systemic immunity without conferring mucosal immunity. Here, we show that AdCOVID, an intranasal adenovirus type 5 (Ad5)-vectored vaccine encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, elicits a strong and focused immune response against RBD through the induction of mucosal IgA, serum neutralizing antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a Th1-like cytokine expression profile. Therefore, AdCOVID, which promotes concomitant systemic and local mucosal immunity, represents a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate.",

    "abstract": "Previous research points to an association between retrieval-related activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and preservation of emotional information compared to co-occurring neutral information following sleep. Although the role of the mPFC in emotional memory likely begins at encoding, little research has examined how mPFC activity during encoding interacts with consolidation processes to enhance emotional memory. This issue was addressed in the present study using transcranial magnetic stimulation in conjunction with an emotional memory paradigm. Healthy young adults encoded negative and neutral scenes while undergoing concurrent TMS with a modified short intermittent theta burst stimulation (sTBS) protocol. Participants received stimulation to either the mPFC or an active control site (motor cortex) during the encoding phase. Recognition memory for scene components (objects and backgrounds) was assessed after a short (30-minute) and a long delay (24-hour, including a night of sleep) to obtain measures of specific and gist-based memory processes. The results demonstrated that, relative to control stimulation, sTBS to the mPFC enhanced memory for negative objects on the long delay test (collapsed across specific and gist-based memory measures). mPFC stimulation had no discernable effect on memory for objects on the short delay test nor on the background images at either test. These results suggest that mPFC activity occurring during encoding interacts with consolidation processes to preferentially preserve negatively salient information.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding how emotional information is remembered over time is critical to understanding memory in the real world. The present study used noninvasive brain stimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, rTMS) to investigate the interplay between mPFC activity that occurs during memory encoding and its subsequent interactions with consolidation processes. rTMS delivered to the mPFC during encoding enhanced memory for negatively valenced pictures on a test following a 24-hr delay, with no such effect on a test occurring shortly after the encoding phase. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that emotional aspects of memories are differentially subjected to consolidation processes, and that the mPFC might contribute to this \"tag-and-capture\" mechanism during the initial formation of such memories.",

    "abstract": "A rapid and cost-effective noninvasive tool to detect and characterize suppressed neural activity can be of significant benefit for the diagnosis and treatment of many disorders. We propose a novel algorithm, SilenceMap, for uncovering the absence of electrophysiological signals, or neural \"silences\", using noninvasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals. By accounting for the contributions of different sources to the power of the recorded signals, and using a novel hemispheric baseline approach and a convex spectral clustering framework, SilenceMap permits rapid detection and localization of regions of silence in the brain using a relatively small amount of EEG data. SilenceMap substantially outperformed existing source localization algorithms in estimating the center-of-mass of the silence for three pediatric patients with lobectomy, using less than 3 minutes of EEG recordings (13, 2, and 11mm vs. 25, 62, and 53mm), as well for 70 different simulated regions of silence based on a real human head model (11{+/-}0.5mm vs. 54{+/-}2.2mm). SilenceMap paves the way towards accessible early diagnosis and continuous monitoring of altered physiological properties of human cortical function.",

In this fMRI study, participants encoded and retrieved schema-congruent and incongruent object-scene pairs using a paradigm that probed coarse and detailed memories over 10-minutes and 72-hours. When a congruent schema was available, details were lost over time as representations were integrated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and enhanced post-encoding coupling between the anterior hippocampus and mPFC was associated with coarser memories. Over time, pattern similarity in the hippocampus changed such that the posterior hippocampus represented specific details and the anterior hippocampus represented the general context of specific memories, irrespective of congruency. Our findings suggest schemas are used as a scaffold for accelerated consolidation of congruent information, and illustrate change in hippocampal organization of detailed contextual memory over time.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) studies showed that corticospinal excitability (CSE) is modulated during observation of object lifting, an effect termed  motor resonance. Specifically, motor resonance is driven by movement features indicating object weight, such as object size or observed movement kinematics. We investigated in 16 humans (8 females) whether motor resonance is also modulated by an objects weight distribution. Participants were asked to lift an inverted T-shaped manipulandum with interchangeable center of mass after first observing an actor lift the same manipulandum. Participants and actor were instructed to minimize object roll and rely on constrained digit positioning during lifting. Constrained positioning was either collinear (i.e., fingertips on the same height) or noncollinear (i.e., fingertip on the heavy side higher than the one on the light side). The center of mass changed unpredictably before the actors lifts and participants were explained that their weight distribution always matched the actors one. Last, TMS was applied during both lift observation and planning of lift actions. Our results showed that CSE was similarly modulated during lift observation and planning: when participants observed or planned lifts in which the weight distribution was asymmetrically right-sided, CSE recorded from the thumb muscles was significantly increased compared to when the weight distribution was left-sided. During both lift observation and planning, this increase seemed to be primarily driven by the weight distribution and not specifically by the (observed) digit positioning or muscle contraction. In conclusion, our results indicate that complex intrinsic object properties such as weight distributions can modulate activation of the motor system during both observation and planning of lifting actions.\n\nHighlights* Motor resonance is observation-induced activity in the observers motor system\n* We used a dyadic lifting task of objects with asymmetrical weight distribution\n* We investigated which movement features modulate motor resonance\n* Motor resonance is modulated by the objects weight distribution\n* Motor resonance is driven by observed and planned digit positioning",

    "abstract": "A large number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients show neurological symptoms such as ischemic- and hemorrhagic stroke as well as encephalitis, and SARS-CoV-2 can directly infect endothelial cells leading to endotheliitis across multiple vascular beds. These findings suggest an involvement of the brain- and peripheral vasculature in COVID-19, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain obscure. To understand the potential mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 tropism for brain vasculature, we constructed a molecular atlas of the expression patterns of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry-associated genes (receptors and proteases) and SARS-CoV-2 interaction partners in human (and mouse) adult and fetal brain as well as in multiple non-CNS tissues in single-cell RNA-sequencing data across various datasets. We observed a distinct expression pattern of the cathepsins B (CTSB) and -L (CTSL) - which are able to substitute for the ACE2 co-receptor TMPRSS2 - in the human vasculature with CTSB being mainly expressed in the brain vasculature and CTSL predominantly in the peripheral vasculature, and these observations were confirmed at the protein level in the Human Protein Atlas and using immunofluorescence stainings. This expression pattern of SARS-CoV-2 viral-entry associated proteases and SARS-CoV-2 interaction partners was also present in endothelial cells and microglia in the fetal brain, suggesting a developmentally established SARS-CoV-2 entry machinery in the human vasculature. At both the adult and fetal stages, we detected a distinct pattern of SARS-CoV-2 entry associated genes transcripts in brain vascular endothelial cells and microglia, providing a potential explanation for an inflammatory response in the brain endothelium upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, CTSB was co-expressed in adult and fetal brain endothelial cells with genes and pathways involved in innate immunity and inflammation, angiogenesis, blood-brain-barrier permeability, vascular metabolism, and coagulation, providing a potential explanation for the role of brain endothelial cells in clinically observed (neuro)vascular symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Our study serves as a publicly available single-cell atlas of SARS-CoV-2 related entry factors and interaction partners in human and mouse brain endothelial- and perivascular cells, which can be employed for future studies in clinical samples of COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to confirm the feasibility of using hybrid immunoglobulin-binding reagents in ELISAs for IgG/IgY detection and detection of specific antibodies against an infectious microorganism (Salmonella spp.) in various animal species using a universal diagnostic ELISA. Hybrid immunoglobulin-binding bacterial proteins (IBP), including recombinant protein LA, recombinant protein LG, and recombinant protein AG, have been produced to improve their binding affinity to a much larger number of immunoglobulins. Thus, this hybrid bacterial protein represents a powerful tool for the binding, detection, and purification of immunoglobulins and their fragments. However, SpLA-LG-peroxidase and SpLAG-anti-IgYperoxidase were produced using the periodate method. These compounds have been shown to be effective as reagents. Their binding affinity to immunoglobulins surpasses that of previously reported hybrid IgG-binding proteins, including the most known SpAG, SpLA, and SpLG. The IgY fraction was isolated from the egg yolks of various birds, including chicken, bantam hen, guinea hen, quail, goose, duck, wild and domestic pigeons, parakeets, cattle egrets, pheasants, and ostrich. The IgY fraction was isolated using the chloroform-polyethylene glycol (PEG) method. An ELISA for anti-Salmonella spp. antibodies was employed with some modifications to determine the presence of antibodies in humans, laying hens, geese, quails, and pigeons. Salmonella is a motile, flagellated, rod-shaped zoonotic pathogen that can survive in the presence or absence of oxygen. They belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae and are implicated in typhoid fever and food-borne illnesses. This pathogen is associated with several diseases, which may become fatal and negatively impact the health of individuals and various economies globally. The poultry industry is most vulnerable to the influence of this pernicious microbe. The authors concluded that universal enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were effective and reproducible in detecting immunoglobulins from both avian and mammalian species, but ELISA using the SpLAG-anti-IgY-HRP conjugate only reacted with the whole panel of animal antibodies. This conjugate was further used to standardize a universal ELISA for the determination of anti-Salmonella antibodies, in which human and avian species were serologically assessed.",

    "abstract": "Inherited immunity is an emerging field and describes how the transfer of immunity from parents to offspring can promote progeny survival in the face of infection. The mechanisms of how inherited immunity is induced are mostly unknown. The intracellular parasite Nematocida parisii is a natural microsporidian pathogen of Caenorhabditis elegans. Here, we show that N. parisii-infected worms produce primed offspring that are resistant to microsporidia infection. We find that immunity is induced in a dose dependent manner and lasts for a single generation. Intergenerational immunity prevents host cell invasion by N. parisii and also enhances survival to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Further, we show that inherited immunity is triggered by the host transcriptional response to infection, which can also be induced through maternal somatic depletion of negative regulators PALS-22 and the retinoblastoma protein ortholog LIN-35. We show that other biotic and abiotic stresses, such as viral infection and cadmium exposure, that induce a similar transcriptional response to microsporidia can also induce immunity in progeny. Our results demonstrate that distinct stimuli can induce inherited immunity to provide resistance against multiple classes of pathogens. These results show that activation of an innate immune response can provide protection against pathogens not only within a generation, but also in the next generation.",

Local ecological predictions will be made for the cover of cross-leaved heath on Danish wet heathlands, which is one of the indicators that determine the conservation status of wet heathlands under different management scenarios. Based on a realistic example, the model predictions concludes that grazing by domestic herbivores on wet heathlands with a relatively low cover cross-leaved heath cannot be recommended as the only management practice.

    "abstract": "A large and rapidly expanding literature has grown out of the observation that humans carry a genetic legacy reflecting ancient inter-breeding with archaic hominins such as Neanderthals and Denisovans. However, a recent study suggests that a commonly used statistic used to assess legacy size, D, is driven mainly by heterozygous sites in Africa acting to increase divergence from our common ancestor rather than introgressed fragments outside Africa reducing divergence. To test this new model, I analysed how D is influenced by heterozygosity within a kilobase of each putative introgressed base. I find that flanking heterozygosity is a potent predictor of D, with introgression always being inferred as having occurred into the population with lower heterozygosity. This pattern cannot be driven by any introgressed fragments themselves, which simulations show create the exact converse pattern, but instead appears to be generated by heterozygosity acting to drive increased divergence from the ancestral sequence. This new model explains why introgression of haploid or semi-haploid regions is essentially lacking and why introgression is often inferred around immune genes and other regions under strong selection. More generally, these results raise the possibility that reported legacies are largely an artefact arising out of the false assumption that mutation rate is constant.",

    "abstract": "Multi-parent populations (MPPs), genetically segregating model systems derived from two or more inbred founder strains, are widely used in biomedical and agricultural research. Gene expression profiling by direct RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is commonly applied to MPPs to investigate gene expression regulation and to identify candidate genes. In genetically diverse populations, including most MPPs, quantification of gene expression is improved when the RNA-Seq reads are aligned to individualized transcriptomes that incorporate known polymorphic loci. However, the process of constructing and analyzing individual genomes can be computationally demanding and error prone. We propose a new approach, genome reconstruction by RNA-Seq (GBRS), that relies on simultaneous alignment of RNA-Seq reads to the founder strain transcriptomes. GBRS can reconstruct the diploid genome of each individual and quantify both total and allele-specific gene expression. We demonstrate that GBRS performs as well as methods that rely on high-density genotyping arrays to reconstruct the founder haplotype mosaic of MPP individuals. Using GBRS in addition to other genotyping methods provides quality control for detecting sample mix-ups and improves power to detect expression quantitative trait loci.

    "abstract": "Computational approaches are often used to predict regulatory RNAs in bacteria, but their success is limited to RNAs that are highly conserved across phyla, in sequence and structure. The ANTAR regulatory system consists of a family of RNAs (the ANTAR-target RNAs) that selectively recruit ANTAR proteins. This protein-RNA complex together regulates genes at the level of translation or transcriptional elongation. Despite the widespread distribution of ANTAR proteins in bacteria, their targets RNAs havent been identified in certain bacterial phyla such as actinobacteria. Here, by using a computational search model that is tuned to actinobacterial genomes, we comprehensively identify ANTAR-target RNAs in actinobacteria. These RNA motifs lie in select transcripts, often overlapping with the ribosome binding site or start codon, to regulate translation. Transcripts harboring ANTAR-target RNAs majorly encode proteins involved in the transport and metabolism of cellular metabolites like sugars, amino acids and ions; or encode transcription factors that in turn regulate diverse genes. In this report, we substantially diversify and expand the family of ANTAR RNAs across bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is linked to -synuclein (aS) aggregation and deposition of amyloid in the substantia nigra region of the brain tissues. Recent reports suggested that oligomeric assembly structure could be neurotoxic to neuronal cells. In the current investigation we produced two distinct classes of aS oligomers and link the protein conformation state and stability to neuronal cell toxicity. Natural oligomers (NO) enriched with alpha-helical folds are produced in storage of aS at below -20{degrees}C for 7 days. Induced oligomer (IO), often observed in the aggregation pathway of aS were made incubating the protein solution at 37{degrees}C. Natural oligomers remained stable and did not transform into {beta}-sheet rich amyloid fiber and exhibited higher toxicity (80% cell death) compared to induced oligomers. Natural oligomers were ovular shape and the size ranged between 4-5.5 nm. It maintained significant number ([~] 60%) of residues in -helical conformational space. However, initiation of hydrophobic zipping with beta sheet conformation was evidenced in induced oligomer (IO) and a lesser number residues (45%) remained with preference to -helical secondary structure. Hydrophobic collapse leads the transformation of IO into thermodynamically most stable {beta}-sheet rich amyloid fibril. Molten globule like secondary structure stabilized by H-bonding in natural oligomers caused enhanced stability and cellular toxicity compared to induced oligomer. Thus off-pathway/natural oligomers could be plausible reason of neuronal cell death and possible cause of Parkinsons disease.",

    "abstract": "Inter and intra-cellular signaling are essential for individual cells to execute various physiological tasks and accurately respond to changes in their environment. Signaling is carried out via diffusible molecules, the transport of which is often aided by active processes that provide directional advection. How diffusion and advection together impact the accuracy of information transmission during cell signaling remains less studied. To this end, we study a one-dimensional model of cell signaling and compute the mutual information (MI) as a measure of information transmission. We find that the efficacy of the information transmission improves with advection only when the system parameters result in Peclet number greater than one. Intriguingly, MI exhibits nontrivial scaling with the Peclet number, characterized by three distinct regimes. We demonstrate that the observed dependence of MI on the transport properties of signaling molecules has important consequences on cellular communication.",

In line with this, mice lacking Drp1 in adult AgRP neurons (Drp1AgRPKO) show decrease in fasting-or ghrelin-induced AgRP neuronal activity and feeding and exhibited a significant decrease in body weight, fat mass, and feeding accompanied by a significant increase in energy expenditure. In support of the role for mitochondrial fission and fatty acids oxidation, Drp1AgRPKO mice showed attenuated palmitic acid-induced mitochondrial respiration.

To unravel its molecular basis, tools probing metabolism of single cells are needed. While RNA devices harbor huge potential for the development of such tools, until today, it is challenging to create in vivo-functional sensors for any given metabolite. Here, we developed from scratch an RNA-based sensor for fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), a doubly phosphorylated intermediate of glycolysis. Starting from in vitro selection of an RNA aptamer and its structural analyses, we developed libraries of RNA-based regulatory devices with this aptamer and the hammerhead ribozyme as an actuator. Through FACS-seq-based high-throughput screening in yeast, we identified in vivo-functional FBP-sensing devices that generate fluorescent readout dependent on intracellular FBP concentration. As FBP reports the flux through glycolysis, the developed RNA device can be used to sense the glycolytic rate in single cells, offering unprecedented possibilities to investigate the causes of metabolic heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Gene regulatory networks (GRN) orchestrate the spatio-temporal levels of gene expression, thereby regulating various cellular functions ranging from embryonic development to tissue home-ostasis. Some patterns called \"motifs\" recurrently appear in the GRNs. Owing to the prevalence of these motifs they have been subjected to much investigation both in the context of understanding cellular decision making and engineering synthetic circuits. Mounting experimental evidence suggest that 1) the copy number of genes associated with these motifs vary, and 2) proteins produced from these genes bind to decoy binding sites on the genome as well as promoters driving the expression of other genes. Together, these two processes engender competition for protein resources within a cell. To unravel how competition for protein resources affect the dynamical properties of regulatory motifs, we propose a simple kinetic model that explicitly incorporates copy number variation (CNV) of genes and decoy binding of proteins. Using quasi steady-state approximations, we theoretically investigate the transient and steady-state properties of three of the commonly found motifs: autoregulation, toggle switch and repressilator. While protein resource competition alters the timescales to reach the steady-state for all these motifs, the dynamical properties of toggle switch and repressilator are affected in multiple ways. For toggle switch, the basins of attraction of the known attractors are dramatically altered if one set of proteins bind to decoys more frequently than the other, an effect which gets suppressed as copy number of toggle switch is enhanced. For repressilators, protein sharing leads to emergence of oscillation in regions of parameter space that were previously non-oscillatory. Intriguingly, both the amplitude and frequency of oscillation are altered in a non-linear manner through the interplay of CNV and decoy binding. Overall, competition for protein resources within a cell provides an additional layer of regulation of gene regulatory motifs.",

    "abstract": "This study highlights the importance of looking beyond the main effect of movement to study alterations in functional response in the presence of central nervous system pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Data show that MS selectively affects regional BOLD (Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent) responses to variable grip forces (GF). It is known that the anterior and posterior BA 4 areas (BA 4a and BA 4p) are anatomically and functionally distinct. It has also been shown in Healthy volunteers that there are linear (1st order, typical of BA 4a) and non-linear (2nd-4th order, typical of BA 4p) BOLD responses to different levels of GF applied during a dynamic motor paradigm. After modelling the BOLD response with a polynomial expansion of the applied GFs, the particular case of BA 4a and BA 4p were investigated in Healthy Volunteers (HV) and MS subjects. The main effect of movement (0th order) analysis showed that the BOLD signal is greater in MS compared to healthy volunteers within both BA 4 sub-regions. At higher order, BOLD-GF responses were similar in BA 4a but showed a marked alteration in BA 4p of MS subjects, with those with greatest disability showing the greatest deviations from the healthy response profile. Therefore, the different behaviour in HV and MS could only be uncovered through a polynomial analysis looking beyond the main effect of movement into the two BA 4 sub-regions. Future studies will investigate the source of this pathophysiology, combining the present fMRI paradigm with blood perfusion and non-linear neuronal response analysis.",

This revealed that dopaminergic and GABAergic synaptic actions are widespread; glutamatergic synaptic actions are robust in the medial nucleus accumbens and the anterolateral dorsal striatum, mediating fast and slow excitation, respectively. Dopamine neuron synaptic actions in cholinergic interneurons are the strongest and most complex, involving all three transmitters, their multiple receptors, and are the most regionally heterogeneous. The caudal striatum forms a single domain with overall weak dopamine neuron synaptic actions. This synaptic mapping reveals that dopamine neuron synaptic actions extend across the entire striatum, are regionally heterogeneous and organized in physiological domains, determined mainly by their excitatory actions.",

    "abstract": "The reactive oxygen species produced during inflammation through the neutrophilic respiratory burst play profound roles in combating bacterial pathogens and regulating the microbiota. Among these, the neutrophilic oxidant bleach, hypochlorous acid (HOCl), is the most prevalent and strongest oxidizer and kills bacteria through non-specific oxidation of proteins, lipids, and DNA. Thus, HOCl can be viewed as a host-specific cue that conveys important information about what bacterial physiology and lifestyle programs may be required for successful colonization. Nevertheless, bacteria that colonize animals face a molecular challenge in how to achieve highly selective detection of HOCl due to its reactive and transient nature and chemical similarity to more benign and non-host-specific oxidants like hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here, we report that in response to increasing HOCl levels E. coli regulates biofilm production via activation of the diguanylate cyclase DgcZ. We show the molecular mechanism of this activation to be specific oxidation of a conserved cysteine that coordinates the zinc of its regulatory chemoreceptor zinc-binding (CZB) domain, forming a zinc-cysteine redox switch 685-fold more sensitive to oxidation by HOCl over H2O2. Dissection of the signal transduction mechanism through quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, and biochemical analyses reveal how the cysteine redox state alters the delicate equilibrium of competition for Zn++ between the CZB domain and other zinc binders to relay the presence of HOCl through activating the associated GGDEF domain to catalyze c-di-GMP. We find biofilm formation and HOCl-sensing in vivo to be regulated by the conserved cysteine, and point mutants that mimic oxidized CZB states increase production of the biofilm matrix polymer poly-N-acetylglucosamine and total biofilm. We observe CZB-regulated diguanylate cyclases and chemoreceptors in phyla in which host-associated bacteria are prevalent and are possessed by pathogens that manipulate host inflammation as part of their colonization strategy. A phylogenetic survey of all known CZB sequences shows these domains to be conserved and widespread across diverse phyla, suggesting CZB origin predates the bacterial last universal common ancestor. The ability of bacteria to use CZB protein domains to perceive and thwart the host neutrophilic respiratory burst has implications for understanding the mechanisms of diseases of chronic inflammation and gut dysbiosis.",

By individually depleting 85 RPs using RNAi, we found overall protein synthesis in uninfected primary fibroblasts was more sensitive to RP-depletion than those infected with herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1). Although representative RP-depletion (uL3, uS4, uL5) inhibited protein synthesis in cells infected with other DNA viruses, HSV-1-infected cell protein synthesis unexpectedly endured and required a single virus-encoded gene product, VP22. During individual RP-insufficiency, VP22-expressing HSV-1 replicated better than a VP22-deficient variant. Furthermore, VP22 cosedimented with ribosomes and polyribosomes in infected cells. This identifies VP22 as a virus-encoded, polyribosome-associated protein that compensates for RP-insufficiency to support viral protein synthesis and replication. Moreover, it reveals an unanticipated class of virus-encoded, ribosome-associated effectors that reduce the dependence of protein synthesis upon RPs and broadly support translation during physiological stress such as infection.",

    "abstract": "Targeted sequencing using Angiosperms353 has emerged as a low-cost tool for phylogenetics, with early results spanning scales from all flowering plants to within genera. The use of universal markers at narrower scales--within populations-- would eliminate the need for specific marker development while retaining the benefits of full-gene sequences. However, it is unclear whether the Angiosperms353 markers provide sufficient variation within species to calculate demographic parameters. Using herbarium specimens from a 50-year-old floristic survey of Guadalupe Mountains National Park, we sequenced 95 samples from 24 species using Angiosperms353. We adapted a data workflow to process targeted sequencing data that calls variants within each species and prepares data for population genetic analysis. We calculated genetic diversity using standard metrics (e.g. heterozygosity, Tajimas D). Angiosperms353 gene recovery was associated with genomic library concentration, with limited phylogenetic bias. We identified over 1000 segregating variants with zero missing data within 22 of 24 species. A subset of these variants, which were filtered to remove linked SNPs, revealed high heterozygosity in many species. Tajimas D calculated within each species indicated a moderate number of markers potentially under selection and identified evidence of population bottlenecks in some species. Despite sequencing few individuals per species, the Angiosperms353 markers contained sufficient variation calculate demographic parameters. Larger sampling within species will allow for estimating gene flow and population dynamics in any angiosperm. Our study will benefit conservation genetics, where Angiosperms353 provides universal repeatable markers, low missing data, and haplotype information.",

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites have a complex life cycle featuring diverse developmental strategies, each uniquely adapted to navigate specific host environments. Here we use single-cell transcriptomics to illuminate gene usage across the transmission cycle of the most virulent agent of human malaria - Plasmodium falciparum. We reveal developmental trajectories associated with the colonisation of the mosquito midgut and salivary glands and elucidate the transcriptional signatures of each transmissible stage. Additionally, we identify both conserved and nonconserved gene usage between human and rodent parasites, which point to both essential mechanisms in malaria transmission and species-specific adaptations potentially linked to host tropism. Together, the data presented here, which are made freely available via an interactive website, establish the most complete atlas of the P. falciparum transcriptional journey to date.\n\nOne sentence summarySingle-cell transcriptomics of P. falciparum transmission stages highlights developmental trajectories and gene usage.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial hormones, such as the iconic gamma-butyrolactone A-factor, are essential signaling molecules that regulate diverse physiological processes, including specialized metabolism. These low molecular weight compounds are common in Streptomyces species and display species-specific structural differences. Recently, unusual gamma-butyrolactone natural products called salinipostins were isolated from the marine actinomycete genus Salinispora based on their anti-malarial properties. As the salinipostins possess a rare phosphotriester motif of unknown biosynthetic origin, we set out to explore its construction by the widely conserved 9-gene spt operon in Salinispora species. We show through a series of in vivo and in vitro studies that the spt gene cluster dually encodes the saliniphostins and newly identified A-factor-like gamma-butyrolactones (Sal-GBLs). Remarkably, homologous biosynthetic gene clusters are widely distributed amongst many actinomycete genera, including Streptomyces, suggesting the significance of this operon in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionLow voltage-activated T-type calcium channels (T-type ICa), CaV3.1, CaV3.2, and CaV3.3 are opened by small depolarizations from the resting membrane potential in many cells and have been associated with neurological disorders including absence epilepsy and pain. {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the principal psychoactive compound in Cannabis and also directly modulates T-type ICa, however, there is no information about functional activity of most phytocannabinoids on T-type calcium channels, including {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol acid (THCA), the natural non-psychoactive precursor of THC. The aim of this work was to characterize THCA effects on T-type calcium channels.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe used HEK293 Flp-In-TREx cells stably expressing CaV3.1, 3.2 or 3.3. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made to investigate cannabinoid modulation of ICa.\n\nResultsTHCA and THC inhibited the peak current amplitude CaV3.1 with a pEC50s of 6.0 {+/-} 0.7 and 5.6 {+/-} 0.4, respectively. 1M THCA or THC produced a significant negative shift in half activation and inactivation of CaV3.1 and both drugs prolonged CaV3.1 deactivation kinetics. THCA (10 M) inhibited CaV3.2 by 53% {+/-} 4 and both THCA and THC produced a substantial negative shift in the voltage for half inactivation and modest negative shift in half activation of CaV3.2. THC prolonged the deactivation time of CaV3.2 while THCA did not. THCA inhibited the peak current of CaV3.3 by 43% {+/-} 2 (10M) but did not notably affect CaV3.3 channel activation or inactivation, however, THC caused significant hyperpolarizing shift in CaV3.3 steady state inactivation.\n\nDiscussionTHCA modulated T-type ICa currents in vitro, with significant modulation of kinetics and voltage dependence at low M concentrations. This study suggests that THCA may have potential for therapeutic use in pain and epilepsy via T-type channel modulation without the unwanted psychoactive effects associated with THC.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are promising cells for regenerative medicine therapies, because they can differentiate towards multiple cell lineages. However, heterogeneity in differentiation capacity is one of the main drawbacks that limit their use clinically. Differences in the occurrence of cellular senescence and in the expression of the senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in MSC populations contribute to their heterogeneity. Here, we show the involvement of TWIST1 expression in the regulation of MSC senescence, demonstrating that silencing of TWIST1 in MSCs increased the occurrence of senescence. These senescent MSCs had a SASP that was different from irradiation-induced senescent MSCs. In addition, metabolic evaluation performed by the Seahorse XF apparatus showed that both TWIST1 silencing-induced and irradiation-induced senescent MSCs had a higher oxygen consumption compared to control MSCs, while TWIST1 silencing-induced senescent MSCs had a low extracellular acidification rate compared to the irradiation-induced senescent MSCs. Overall, our data indicate how TWIST1 regulation influences senescence in human MSCs and that TWIST1 silencing-induced senescence is characterized by a specific expression of the SASP and the metabolic state.",
