    "abstract": "Young infants learn about the world by overtly shifting their attention to perceptually salient events. In adults, attention recruits several brain regions spanning the frontal and parietal lobes. However, these regions are thought to have a protracted maturation and so it is unclear whether they are recruited in infancy and, more generally, how infant attention is supported by the brain. We used event-related fMRI with 24 awake behaving infants 3-12 months old while they performed a child-friendly attentional cuing task. A target was presented to either the left or right of the infants fixation and eye-tracking was used to measure the latency with which they saccaded to the target. To manipulate attention, a brief cue was presented before the target in three conditions: on the same side as the upcoming target (valid), on the other side (invalid), or on both sides (neutral). All infants were faster to look at the target on valid versus invalid trials, with valid faster than neutral and invalid slower than neutral, indicating that the cues effectively captured attention. We then compared the fMRI activity evoked by these trial types. Regions of adult attention networks activated more strongly for invalid than valid trials, particularly frontal regions such as anterior cingulate cortex. Neither behavioral nor neural effects varied by infant age within the first year, suggesting that these regions may function early in development to support the reorienting of attention. Together, this furthers our mechanistic understanding of how the infant brain controls the allocation of attention.",

    "abstract": "In presymptomatic Alzheimers disease (AD), beta-amyloid plaques (A{beta}) and tau tangles accumulate in distinct spatiotemporal patterns within the brain, tracking closely with episodic memory decline. Here, we tested whether age-related changes in the segregation of the brains functional episodic memory networks - anterior-temporal (AT) and posterior-medial (PM) networks - are associated with the accumulation of A{beta}, tau and memory decline using fMRI and PET. We found that AT and PM networks were less segregated in older than younger adults and this reduced specialization was associated with more tau and A{beta} in the same regions. The effect of network dedifferentiation on memory depended on the amount of A{beta} and tau, with low segregation and pathology associated with better performance at baseline and low segregation and high pathology related to worse performance over time. This pattern suggests a compensation phase followed by a degenerative phase in the early, preclinical phase of AD.",

    "abstract": "Impulsivity and thought suppression are two psychological traits that have great variation in healthy population. In extreme cases, both are closely related to mental illness and play an important role in behavioral addiction. We have known the role of the top-down mechanism in impulsivity and thought suppression, but we do not know how the related neural nuclei are functionally connected and interact with each other. In the study, we selected excessive internet users (EIU) as our target population and investigated the relationship between thought suppression and impulsivity in the following aspects: their correlations to psychological symptoms; the associated neural networks; and the associated brain morphometric changes. We acquired data from 131 excessive internet users, with their psychological, resting-state fMRI and T1-MRI data collected. With the whole brain analysis, graph theory analysis, replication with additional brain atlas, replication with additional MRI data, and analysis of brain structure, we found that: (i) implusivity and thought suppression shared common neural connections in the top-down mechanism; (ii) thought suppression was associated with the neural network that connected to the occipital lobe in the resting-state brain but not the morphometric change of the occipital lobe. The study confirmed the overlap between impulsivity and thought suppression in terms of neural connectivity and suggested the role of thought suppression and the occipital network in behavioral addiction. Studying thought suppression provided a new insight into behavioral addiction research. The neural network study helped further understanding of behavioral addiction in terms of information interaction in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Infection with the bacterial pathogen Clostridioides difficile causes severe damage to the intestinal epithelium that elicits a robust inflammatory response. Markers of intestinal inflammation accurately predict clinical disease severity. However, determining the extent to which host-derived proinflammatory mediators drive pathogenesis versus promote host protective mechanisms remains elusive. In this report, we employed Il10-/- mice as a model of spontaneous colitis to examine the impact of constitutive intestinal immune activation, independent of infection, on C. difficile disease pathogenesis. Upon C. difficile challenge, Il10-/- mice exhibited significantly decreased morbidity and mortality compared to littermate Il10 heterozygote (Il10HET) control mice, despite a comparable C. difficile burden, innate immune response, and microbiota composition following infection. Similarly, antibody-mediated blockade of IL-10 signaling in wild-type C57BL/6 mice conveyed a survival advantage if initiated three weeks prior to infection. In contrast, no advantage was observed if blockade was initiated on the day of infection, suggesting that constitutive activation of inflammatory defense pathways prior to infection mediated host protection. IL-22, a cytokine critical in mounting a protective response against C. difficile infection, was elevated in the intestine of uninfected, antibiotic-treated Il10-/- mice, and genetic ablation of the IL-22 signaling pathway in Il10-/- mice negated the survival advantage following C. difficile challenge. Collectively, these data demonstrate that constitutive loss of IL-10 signaling, via genetic ablation or antibody blockade, enhances IL-22 dependent host defense mechanisms to limit C. difficile pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Hsp70s and J-domain proteins (JDPs) are among the most critical components of the cellular protein quality control machinery, playing crucial roles in preventing and solubilizing cytotoxic protein aggregates. Bacteria, yeast and plants additionally have large, multimeric Hsp100-class disaggregases which, allow the resolubilization of otherwise \"dead-end\" aggregates, including amyloids. JDPs interact with aggregated proteins and specify the aggregate remodeling activities of Hsp70s and Hsp100s. Plants have a complex network of cytosolic Hsp70s and JDPs, however the aggregate remodeling properties of plant JDPs are not well understood. Here we identify evolutionary-conserved Class II JDPs in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana with distinct aggregate remodeling functionalities. We identify eight plant orthologs of the yeast protein, Sis1, the principal JDP responsible for directing the yeast chaperone machinery for remodeling protein aggregates. Expression patterns vary dramatically among the eight paralogous proteins under a variety of stress conditions, indicating their subfunctionalization to address distinct stressors. Consistent with a role in solubilizing cytotoxic protein aggregates, six of these plant JDPs associate with heat-induced protein aggregates in vivo as well as colocalize with plant Hsp101 to distinct heat-induced protein aggregate centers. Finally, we show that these six JDPs can differentially remodel multiple model protein aggregates in yeast confirming their involvement in aggregate resolubilization. These results demonstrate that compared to complex metazoans, plants have a robust network of JDPs involved in aggregate remodeling activities with the capacity to process a variety of protein aggregate conformers.",

    "abstract": "Studying how novel phenotypes originate and evolve is fundamental to the field of evolutionary biology as it allows us to understand how organismal diversity is generated and maintained. However, determining the basis of novel phenotypes is challenging as it involves orchestrated changes at multiple biological levels. Here, we aim to overcome this challenge by using a comparative species framework combining behavioral, gene expression, and genomic analyses to understand the evolutionary novel egg-laying substrate-choice behavior of the invasive pest species Drosophila suzukii. First, we used egg-laying behavioral assays to understand the evolution of ripe fruit oviposition preference in D. suzukii as compared to closely related species D. subpulchrella and D. biarmipes, as well as D. melanogaster. We show that D. subpulchrella and D. biarmipes lay eggs on both ripe and rotten fruits, suggesting that the transition to ripe fruit preference was gradual. Secondly, using two-choice oviposition assays, we studied how D. suzukii, D. subpulchrella, D. biarmipes and D. melanogaster differentially process key sensory cues distinguishing ripe from rotten fruit during egg-laying. We found that D. suzukiis preference for ripe fruit is in part mediated through a species-specific preference for stiff substrates. Lastly, we sequenced and annotated a high-quality genome for D. subpulchrella. Using comparative genomic approaches, we identified candidate genes involved in D. suzukiis ability to seek out and target ripe fruits. Our results provide detail to the stepwise evolution of pest activity in D. suzukii, indicating important cues used by this species when finding a host, and the molecular mechanisms potentially underlying their adaptation to a new ecological niche.",

    "abstract": "Motor learning is fundamental to motor rehabilitation outcomes and has been associated with visuospatial memory function in previous studies. Current predictive models of motor recovery of individuals with stroke generally exclude cognitive measures, overlooking the connection between motor learning and visuospatial memory. Recent work has demonstrated that a clinical test of visuospatial memory (Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Delayed Recall) may predict one-month skill learning in older adults, but if this relationship persists in individuals with chronic stroke remains unknown. The purpose of this short report was to extend these findings by evaluating the extent these test scores impacted prediction in older adults and determine if this relationship generalized to individuals with stroke pathology. To address these questions, we trained two regression models (one including Delayed Recall scores and one without) using data from non-stroke older adults. To determine the extent to which Delayed Recall test scores impacted prediction accuracy of one-month skill learning in older adults, we used leave-one-out cross-validation to evaluate the prediction error between models. To determine if this predictive relationship persisted in individuals with chronic ischemic stroke, we then tested each trained model on an independent stroke dataset. Results indicated that in both stroke and non-stroke datasets, inclusion of Delayed Recall scores explained significantly more variance of one-month skill performance than models that included age, education, and baseline motor performance alone. This proof-of-concept suggests that the relationship between delayed visuospatial memory and one-month motor skill performance generalizes to individuals with chronic stroke and supports the idea that visuospatial testing may provide prognostic insight into motor rehabilitation outcomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExisting computational methods for studying miRNA regulation are mostly based on bulk miRNA and mRNA expression data. However, bulk data only allows the analysis of miRNA regulation regarding a group of cells, rather than the miRNA regulation unique to individual cells. Recent advance in single-cell miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing technology has opened a way for investigating miRNA regulation at single-cell level. However, as currently single-cell miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing data is just emerging and only available at small-scale, there is a strong need of novel methods to exploit existing single-cell data for the study of cell-specific miRNA regulation.\n\nResultsIn this work, we propose a new method, CSmiR (Cell-Specific miRNA regulation) to use single-cell miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing data to identify miRNA regulatory networks at the resolution of individual cells. We apply CSmiR to the miRNA-mRNA co-sequencing data in 19 K562 single-cells to identify cell-specific miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks for understanding miRNA regulation in each K562 single-cell. By analyzing the obtained cell-specific miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks, we observe that the miRNA regulation in each K562 single-cell is unique. Moreover, we conduct detailed analysis on the cell-specific miRNA regulation associated with the miR-17/92 family as a case study. Finally, through exploring cell-cell similarity matrix characterized by cell-specific miRNA regulation, CSmiR provides a novel strategy for clustering single-cells to help understand cell-cell crosstalk.\n\nConclusionsTo the best of our knowledge, CSmiR is the first method to explore miRNA regulation at a single-cell resolution level, and we believe that it can be a useful method to enhance the understanding of cell-specific miRNA regulation.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary high-throughput mutagenesis experiments are providing an increasingly detailed view of the complex patterns of genetic interaction that occur between multiple mutations within a single protein or regulatory element. By simultaneously measuring the effects of thousands of combinations of mutations, these experiments have revealed that the genotype-phenotype relationship typically reflects genetic interactions not only between pairs of sites, but also higher-order interactions among larger numbers of sites. However, modeling and understanding these higher-order interactions remains challenging. Here, we present a method for reconstructing sequence-to-function mappings from partially observed data that can accommodate all orders of genetic interaction. The main idea is to make predictions for unobserved genotypes that match the type and extent of epistasis found in the observed data. This information on the type and extent of epistasis can be extracted by considering how phenotypic correlations change as a function of mutational distance, which is equivalent to estimating the fraction of phenotypic variance due to each order of genetic interaction (additive, pairwise, three-way, etc.). Using these estimated variance components, we then define an empirical Bayes prior that in expectation matches the observed pattern of epistasis, and reconstruct the genotype-phenotype mapping by conducting Gaussian process regression under this prior. To demonstrate the power of this approach, we present an application to the antibody-binding domain GB1 and also provide a detailed exploration of a dataset consisting of high-throughput measurements for the splicing efficiency of human pre-mRNA 5' splice sites, for which we also validate our model predictions via additional low-throughput experiments.",

The commonality is in the phylogenetic retrodiction based on the genomic reads in both scenarios. While there is evidence of heteroplasmy, i.e., multiple lineages of SARS-CoV-2 in the same COVID-19 patient; to date, there is no evidence of sublineages recombining within the same patient. The heterogeneity in a patients tumor is analogous to intra-patient heteroplasmy and the absence of recombination in the cells of tumor is a widely accepted assumption. Just as the different frequencies of the genomic variants in a tumor presupposes the existence of multiple tumor clones and provides a handle to computationally infer them, we postulate that so do the different variant frequencies in the viral reads, offering the means to infer the multiple co-infecting sublineages. We describe the Concerti computational framework for inferring phylogenies in each of the two scenarios. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, we reproduce some known results in both scenarios. We also make some additional discoveries. We uncovered new potential parallel mutation in the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In the context of cancer, we uncovered new clones harboring resistant mutations to therapy from clinically plausible phylogenetic tree in a patient.",

The introduction of machine-learning techniques has enabled substantial improvements in precision and a shift from predicting binary contacts to predicting distances between pairs of residues. These developments have significantly improved the accuracy of de novo prediction of static protein structures. Here we examine the potential of these residue-residue distance predictions to predict protein flexibility rather than static structure. We used DMPfold to predict distance distributions for every residue pair in a set of proteins that showed both rigid and flexible behaviour. Residue pairs that were in contact in at least one reference structure were considered and classified as rigid, flexible or neither. The predicted distance distribution of each residue pair was analysed for local maxima of probability indicating the most likely distance or distances between a pair of residues. The average number of local maxima per residue pair was found to be different between the sets of rigid and flexible residue pairs. Flexible residue pairs more often had multiple local maxima in their predicted distance distribution than rigid residue pairs suggesting that the shape of predicted distance distributions is predictive of rigidity or flexibility of residue pairs.",

    "abstract": "Comprehensive characterizations of bladder cancer (BCa) have established molecular phenotype classes with distinct alterations and survival trends. Extending these studies within the tyrosine kinase (TK) family to identify disease drivers could improve our use of TK inhibitors to treat specific patient groups or individuals. We examined the expression distribution of TKs as a class (n = 89) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) muscle invasive BCa data set (n >400). Patient profiles of potentially oncogenic alterations (overexpression and/or amplification) clustered TKs into 3 groups; alterations of group 1 and 3 TKs were associated with significantly worse patient survival relative to those without alterations. Many TK pathways induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which promotes tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Overexpression and/or amplification among 9 EMT transcriptional activators occurred in 43% of TCGA cases. Co-occurring alterations of TKs and EMT transcriptional activators involved most group 1 TKs; 24% of these events were associated with significantly worse patient survival. Co-occurring alterations of receptor TKs and their cognate ligands occurred in 16% of TCGA cases and several BCa-derived cell lines. Suppression of GAS6, MST1 or CSF1, or their respective receptors (AXL, MST1R and CSF1R), in BCa cell lines was associated with decreased receptor activation, cell migration, cell proliferation and anchorage independent cell growth. These studies reveal the patterns and prevalence of potentially oncogenic TK pathway-related alterations in BCa and identify specific alterations associated with reduced BCa patient survival.

    "abstract": "Abstract\n\nInsulin receptor (Insr) protein can be found at higher levels in pancreatic {beta}-cells than in most other tissues, but the consequences of {beta}-cell insulin resistance remain enigmatic. Ins1cre allele was used to delete Insr specifically in {beta}-cells of both female and male mice. Experimental mice were compared to Ins1cre-containing littermate controls at multiple ages and on multiple diets. RNA-seq of purified recombined {beta}-cells revealed transcriptomic consequences of Insr loss, which differed between female and male mice. Action potential and calcium oscillation frequencies were increased in Insr knockout {beta}- cells from female, but not male mice, whereas only male {beta}InsrKO mice had reduced ATP-coupled oxygen consumption rate and reduced expression of genes involved in ATP synthesis. Female {beta}InsrKO and {beta}InsrHET mice exhibited elevated insulin release in perifusion experiments, during hyperglycemic clamps, and following i.p. glucose challenge. Deletion of Insr did not alter {beta}-cell area up to 9 months of age, nor did it impair hyperglycemia-induced proliferation. Based on our data, we adapted a mathematical model to include {beta}-cell insulin resistance, which predicted that {beta}-cell Insr knockout would improve glucose tolerance depending on the degree of whole-body insulin resistance. Indeed, glucose tolerance was significantly improved in female {beta}InsrKO and {beta}InsrHET mice when compared to controls at 9, 21 and 39 weeks, and also in insulin-sensitive 4-week old males. We did not observe improved glucose tolerance in older male mice or in high fat diet-fed mice, corroborating the prediction that global insulin resistance obscures the effects of {beta}-cell specific insulin resistance. The propensity for hyperinsulinemia was associated with mildly reduced fasting glucose and increased body weight. We further validated our main in vivo findings using the Ins1-CreERT transgenic line and found that male mice had improved glucose tolerance 4 weeks after tamoxifen-mediated Insr deletion. Collectively, our data show that loss of {beta}-cell Insr contributes to glucose-induced hyperinsulinemia, thereby improving glucose homeostasis in otherwise insulin sensitive dietary and age contexts.",

The urgent need for a vaccine has led to the development of various immunization approaches. mRNA vaccines represent a cell-free, simple and rapid platform for immunization, and therefore have been employed in recent studies towards the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. In this study, we present the design of a lipid nanoparticles (LNP)-encapsulated receptor binding domain (RBD) mRNA vaccine. Several ionizable lipids have been evaluated in vivo in a luciferase mRNA reporter assay, and two leading LNPs formulation have been chosen for the subsequent RBD mRNA vaccine experiment. Intramuscular administration of LNP RBD mRNA elicited robust humoral response, high level of neutralizing antibodies and a Th1-biased cellular response in BALB/c mice. These novel lipids open new avenues for mRNA vaccines in general and for a COVID19 vaccine in particular.",

At Tor Caldara, filamentous microbial biofilms, mainly composed of Epsilon- and Gammaproteobacteria, grow on substrates exposed to the gas venting. In this study, we took a metaproteogenomic approach to identify the metabolic potential and in situ expression of central metabolic pathways at two stages of biofilm maturation. Our findings indicate that inorganic reduced sulfur species are the main electron donors and CO2 the main carbon source for the filamentous biofilms, which conserve energy by oxygen and nitrate respiration, fix dinitrogen gas and detoxify heavy metals. Three metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs), representative of key members in the biofilm community, were also recovered. Metaproteomic data show that metabolically active chemoautotrophic sulfide-oxidizing members of the Epsilonproteobacteria dominated the young microbial biofilms, while Gammaproteobacteria become prevalent in the established community. The co-expression of different pathways for sulfide oxidation by these two classes of bacteria suggests exposure to different sulfide concentrations within the biofilms, as well as fine-tuned adaptations of the enzymatic complexes. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a shift in the taxonomic composition and associated metabolic activity of these biofilms in the course of the colonization process.",

    "abstract": "The picocyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus are found throughout the oceans euphotic zone, where the daily light:dark cycle drives their physiology. Periodic deep mixing events can, however, move cells below this zone, depriving them of light for extended periods of time. Here we demonstrate that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus can adapt to tolerate repeated periods of light energy deprivation. Cyanobacterial cultures kept in the dark for 3 days and then returned to the light initially required 18-26 days to resume growth, but after multiple rounds of dark exposure the strains began to regrow after only 1-2 days. This dark-tolerant phenotype was stable and heritable; cultures retained the trait across at least 18-21 generations even when grown in a standard 13:11 light:dark cycle. We found no genetic differences between the dark-tolerant and parental strains of Prochlorococcus NATL2A, indicating that an epigenetic change is responsible for the adaptation. To begin to explore this possibility, we asked whether DNA methylation - an epigenetic mechanism in bacteria - occurs in Prochlorococcus. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that while DNA methylations, including 6mA and 5mC, are found in some other Prochlorococcus strains, no methylations were detected in either the parental or dark-tolerant strain used in our experiments -i.e. the NATL2A strain. These findings suggest that Prochlorococcus utilizes a yet-to-be-determined epigenetic mechanism to adapt to the stress of extended light energy deprivation.",

Using the Cas9-mediated gene knock-in system, we established GCaMP3-stably expressing Pv11 cells to monitor intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Intriguingly, trehalose treatment evoked a transient increase of cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, and further experiments indicated the contribution of the calmodulin - calcineurin - NFAT pathway to the tolerance for trehalose treatment as well as the desiccation tolerance, while the calmodulin - calmodulin Kinase - CREB pathway conferred only the desiccation tolerance on Pv11 cells. Thus, our results show the critical contribution of the trehalose-induced Ca2+ surge to the anhydrobiosis and the temporal different roles of each signaling pathway.",

Deciphering the cellular ubiquitin code is of central importance to understand the physiology of the cell. Among the eight possible linkages, K29-linked polyubiquitin is a relatively abundant type of polyubiquitin in both human and yeast cells. However, our understanding of its function is rather limited due to the lack of specific binders as tools to detect K29-linked polyubiquitin. In this study, we screened and characterized a synthetic antigen-binding fragment, termed sAB-K29, that can specifically recognize K29-linked polyubiquitin using chemically synthesized K29-linked diubiquitin. We further determined the crystal structure of this fragment bound to the K29-linked diubiquitin, which revealed the molecular basis of specificity. Using sAB-K29 as a tool, we uncovered that K29-linked ubiquitination is involved in different kinds of cellular proteotoxic stress response as well as cell cycle regulation. In particular, we showed that K29-linked ubiquitination is enriched in the midbody and downregulation of the K29-linked ubiquitination signal arrests cells in G1/S phase.",

We also detected the expression of tau protein in the vascular smooth muscle of brain tissues from patients with systemic hypertension who died of ischemic stroke. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that phosphorylated tau at threonine 181 is more organized in the cell than does total tau protein. A protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A induced the formation of higher molecular weight species of phosphorylated tau as visualized by Western blotting, indicating the occurrence of tau aggregation. Immunofluorescence also showed that calyculin A caused the aggregation of phosphorylated tau and disrupted the cytoskeletal organization. These results demonstrate the existence of tau protein in smooth muscle cells and tissues and that smooth muscle tau is susceptible to protein phosphorylation and aggregation.",

TAMs are associated with a chemoresistance to 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU), but the mechanisms involved are still poorly understood. In the present study, we found that macrophages specifically overexpress dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) in hypoxia, leading to a macrophage-induced chemoresistance to 5-FU by inactivation of the drug. Macrophage DPD expression in hypoxia is translationally controlled by the cap-dependent protein synthesis complex eIF4FHypoxic, which includes HIF-2. We discovered that TAMs constitute the main contributors to DPD activity in human colorectal primary or secondary tumors where cancer cells do not express significant levels of DPD. Together, these findings shed light on the role of TAMs in forming chemoresistance in colorectal cancers and offer the identification of new therapeutic targets. Additionally, we report that, contrary to what is found in humans, macrophages in mice do not express DPD.",

Whether this heterogeneity results from generation of distinct astrocyte cell lineages, each functionally specialized to perform specific tasks, remains an open question. In this study, we used RNA-seq analysis to determine the global transcriptome profile of the Olig2-expressing astrocyte subtype (Olig2-AS), a specific spinal astrocyte subtype which segregates early during development from Olig2 progenitors and differs from other spinal astrocytes by the expression of Olig2. We identified 245 differentially expressed genes. Among them, 135 exhibit higher levels of expression when compared to other populations of spinal astrocytes, indicating that these genes can serve as a  uniquefunctional signature of Olig2-AS. Further analysis highlighted, in particular, enrichment in Olig2-AS of a set of genes specialized in regulating synaptic activity. Our work thus reveals that Olig2 progenitors produce a unique astrocyte subtype specialized to perform certain specific functions.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic genetic programme of a cell is not sufficient to explain all of the cells activities. External mechanical stimuli are increasingly recognized as determinants of cell behaviour. In the epithelial folding event that constitutes the beginning of gastrulation in Drosophila, the genetic programme of the future mesoderm leads to the establishment of a contractile actomyosin network that triggers apical constriction of cells, and thereby, tissue folding. However, some cells do not constrict but instead stretch, even though they share the same genetic programme as their constricting neighbours. We show here that tissue-wide interactions force these cells to expand even when an otherwise sufficient amount of apical, active actomyosin is present. Models based on contractile forces and linear stress-strain responses do not reproduce experimental observations, but simulations in which cells behave as ductile materials with non-linear mechanical properties do. Our models show that this behaviour is a general emergent property of actomyosin networks [in a supracellular context, in accordance with our experimental observations of actin reorganisation within stretching cells.",

    "abstract": "In the United States, tick-borne disease cases have tripled since the 1990s and cost upwards of 10 billion USD annually. Tick density and densities and diversity of non-human mammalian reservoir hosts are hypothesized to drive tick-borne disease dynamics and are targets for interventions. Here, we relate human prevalence of four tick-borne diseases (Lyme disease, monocytic ehrlichiosis, granulocytic anaplasmosis, and babesiosis) to tick and reservoir host community data collected by the U.S. National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) across the contiguous U.S. We show that human disease prevalence is correlated positively with tick and reservoir host densities and negatively with mammalian diversity for Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis, but positively for anaplasmosis and babesiosis. Our results suggest that the efficacy of tick-borne disease interventions depends on tick and host densities and host diversity. Thus, policymakers and disease managers should consider these ecological contexts before implementing preventative measures.\n\nSignificanceTick-borne disease incidence has increased in the United States over the last three decades. Because life-long symptoms can occur if reactive antibiotics are not administered soon after the tick bite, prevention is imperative. Yet, control of tick-borne zoonoses has been largely unsuccessful, at least partly because of a limited understanding of the ecological complexities of these diseases, especially non-Lyme disease tick-borne zoonoses. We use continental-scale data to quantify the relationships among four tick-borne diseases and tick and reservoir host communities, revealing that disease incidence is driven by a combination of tick densities and reservoir host densities and diversity. Thus, the efficacy of tick-borne disease interventions is likely dependent on these ecological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely found in the environment because of their extensive use and persistence. Although several PFAS are well studied, most lack toxicity data to inform human health hazard and risk assessment. This study focussed on four model PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA; 8 carbon), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS; 4 carbon), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS; 8 carbon), and perfluorodecane sulfonate (PFDS; 10 carbon). Human primary liver cell spheroids (pooled from 10 donors) were exposed to 10 concentrations of each PFAS and analyzed at four time-points. The approach aimed to: (1) identify gene expression changes mediated by the PFAS; (2) identify similarities in biological responses; (3) compare PFAS potency through benchmark concentration analysis; and (4) derive bioactivity exposure ratios (ratio of the concentration at which biological responses occur, relative to daily human exposure). All PFAS induced transcriptional changes in cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism pathways, and predicted PPAR activation. PFOS exhibited the most transcriptional activity and had a highly similar gene expression profile to PFDS. PFBS induced the least transcriptional changes and the highest benchmark concentration (i.e., was the least potent). The data indicate that these PFAS may have common molecular targets and toxicities, but that PFOS and PFDS are the most similar. The transcriptomic bioactivity exposure ratios derived here for PFOA and PFOS were comparable to those derived using rodent apical endpoints in risk assessments. These data provide a baseline level of toxicity for comparison with other known PFAS using this testing strategy.",

The inhibitors have potencies comparable to the noncompetitive tamoxifen metabolite, endoxifen. Our two most potent inhibitors, AR11 and AR13, exhibit both mixed-type and competitive-type inhibition. The cytochrome P450 reductase-Cyp19 coupling interface likely acts as a transient binding site. Our modeling shows that our inhibitors bind better at different sites near the catalytic site. Our results predict the location of multiple ligand binding sites on aromatase. The combination of modeling and experimental results supports the important role of the reductase binding interface as a low affinity, promiscuous ligand binding site. Our new inhibitors may be useful as alternative chemical scaffolds that may show different adverse effects profiles than current clinically used aromatase inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "The polyphagous pest Apolygus lucorum has become the dominant insect in Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton fields. The hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) regulates multiple events in insect development and physiology. 20E responses are controlled by pathways triggered by phospholipase C (PLC)-associated proteins. However, 20E-modulated genes whose expression is affected by PLC remain unknown. Here, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and immunoblot were carried out for comparing differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in A. lucorum in response to 20E and the PLC inhibitor U73122, respectively. Totally 1624 DEPs were, respectively, found in the 20E/control, U73122/control, and 20E+U73122/control groups. Venn diagram analysis further revealed 8 DEPs that were shared among the three groups. Immunoblot validated these findings, which corroborated and highlighted the reliability of proteomics. KEGG enrichment analysis showed that the DEPs were included in diverse signaling pathways. The largest portion of DEPs among the three groups were categorized in metabolic pathways. In addition, DEPs among the three groups were also found to regulate the Ras-MAPK and PI3K-AKT pathways. This is the first time that iTRAQ was carried out to assess proteome alteration in A. lucorum nymphs in response to 20E and a PLC inhibitor. These findings provide novel insights into protein expression in A. lucorum in response to 20E, and a more comprehensive understanding of the function of PLC in 20E signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "Renin is a pepsin-like aspartyl protease and an important drug target for the treatment of hypertension; despite three decades research, its pH-dependent structure-function relationship remains poorly understood. Here we employed the continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations to decipher the acid/base roles of renins catalytic dyad and the conformational dynamics of the flap, which is a common structural feature among aspartyl proteases. The calculated pKas suggest that the catalytic Asp38 and Asp226 serve as the general base and acid, respectively, in agreement with experiment and supporting the hypothesis that renins neutral optimum pH is due to the substrate-induced pKa shifts of the aspartic dyad. The CpHMD data confirmed our previous hypothesis that hydrogen bond formation is the major determinant of the dyad pKa order. Additionally, our simulations showed that renins flap remains open regardless of pH, although a Tyr-inhibited state is occasionally formed above pH 5. These findings are discussed in comparison to the related aspartyl proteases, including {beta}-secretases 1 and 2, capthepsin D, and plasmepsin II. Our work represents a first step towards a systematic understanding of the pH-dependent structure-dynamics-function relationships of pepsin-like aspartyl proteases that play important roles in biology and human disease states.",

However, currently, only a couple of FRET pairs can be reliably measured on a single object. The limited number of available FRET pair fluorophores and complicated data analysis makes it challenging to apply single-molecule FRET for structural analysis of biomolecules. Currently, only a couple of FRET pairs can be reliably measured on a single object. Here we present an approach that allows for the determination of multiple distances between FRET pairs in a single object. We use programmable, transient binding between short DNA strands to resolve the FRET efficiency of multiple fluorophore pairs. By allowing only a single FRET pair to be formed at a time, we can determine the FRET efficiency and pair distance with sub-nanometer resolution. We determine the distance between other pairs by sequentially exchanging DNA strands. We name this multiplexing approach FRET X for FRET via DNA eXchange. We envision that our FRET X technology will be a tool for the high-resolution structural analysis of biomolecules and other nano-structures.",

    "abstract": "Cytometry of reaction rate constant (CRRC) is an accurate and robust approach to characterize cell-population heterogeneity using rate constants of cellular processes for which kinetic mechanisms are known. We work on a CRRC-based method to develop predictors of tumor chemoresistance driven by two processes: drug extrusion by multi-drug-resistance (MDR) transporters and drug inactivation by cytochrome-P450 enzymes (CYP). Each of the two possess is studied with its specific substrate and the process activity is characterized by a corresponding unimolecular rate constant. Due to the incompatibility of MDR and CYP assays, MDR and CYP activities may be difficult to measure simultaneously suggesting that they may need to be measured sequentially. The sequential measurements may also impose a problem: the results of the second assay may be affected by artifacts exerted by the first assay. The goal of this work was to understand whether the cells have a memory of the first assay that significantly affects the results of the second assay. To achieve this goal, we compared CRRC results for two orders of sequential measurements: the MDR[-&gt;]CYP order in which MDR activity is measured before CYP activity and the CYP[-&gt;]MDR order in which CYP activity is measured before MDR activity. It was found that the results of the CYP assay were similar in both orders; on the contrary, the results of the MDR assay were significantly different. Our findings suggest that MDR and CYP activity can be studied sequentially provided that MDR activity is measured first and CYP activity second.",

    "abstract": "Enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) family catalyze the metabolism of chemotherapeutic agents and are among the key players in primary and acquired chemoresistance of cancer. The activity of CYP is heterogeneous in tumor tissues, and the quantitative characteristics of this heterogeneity can be used to predict chemoresistance. Cytometry of reaction rate constant (CRRC) is a kinetic approach to assess cell population heterogeneity by measuring rates of processes at the single-cell level via time-lapse imaging. CRRC was shown to be an accurate and robust method for assessing the heterogeneity of drug-extrusion activity catalyzed by ABC transporters, which are also key players in cancer chemoresistance. We hypothesized that CRRC is also a reliable method for assessing the heterogeneity of CYP activity. Here, we evaluated the robustness of assessing the heterogeneity of CYP activity by CRRC with respect to controlled variation in the concentration of a CYP substrate by comparing CRRC with non-kinetic approaches. We found that changing the substrate concentration by 20% resulted only in minimal changes in the position, width, and asymmetry of the peak in the CRRC histogram, while these parameters varied greatly in the non-kinetic histograms. Moreover, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistical test showed that the distribution of the cell population in CRRC histograms was not significantly different; the result was opposite for non-kinetic histograms. In conclusion, we were able to demonstrate the robustness of CRRC with respect to changes in substrate concentration when evaluating CYP activity at the single-cell level.",

However, the H3K27me3 recognition and transcriptional repression mechanisms are only partially understood. Here, we report a new mechanism for H3K27me3 recognition and transcriptional repression. Our structural and biochemical data showed that the BAH domain protein AIPP3 and the PHD proteins AIPP2 and PAIPP2 cooperate to read H3K27me3 and unmodified H3K4 histone marks, respectively, in Arabidopsis. The BAH-PHD bivalent histone reader complex silences a substantial subset of H3K27me3-enriched loci, including a number of development and stress response-related genes such as the RNA silencing effector gene ARGONAUTE 5 (AGO5) and We found that the BAH-PHD module associates with CPL2, a plant-specific Pol II carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) phosphatase, to form the BAH-PHD-CPL2 complex (BPC) for transcriptional repression. The BPC complex represses transcription through CPL2-mediated CTD dephosphorylation, thereby causing inhibition of Pol II release from the transcriptional start site. Our work reveals a mechanism coupling H3K27me3 recognition with transcriptional repression through the alteration of Pol II phosphorylation states, thereby contributing to our understanding of the mechanism of H3K27me3-dependent silencing.",

Using a novel category learning paradigm, we assess the effect of both sleep and time of day on generalization that depends on the flexible integration of recent information. Counter to our expectations, we found no evidence that this form of generalization is better after a night of sleep relative to a day awake. Instead, we observed an effect of time of day, with better generalization in the morning than the evening. This effect also manifested as increased false memory for generalized information. In a nap experiment, we found that generalization did not benefit from having slept recently, suggesting a role for circadian rhythms apart from sleep. We found, however, that this time of day effect appears to be sensitive to category structure and to task engagement more generally. We propose that a state of lowered inhibition in the morning may facilitate spreading activation between otherwise separate memories, promoting this form of generalization.",

    "abstract": "Since Odysseus committed to resisting the Sirens, mechanisms to limit self-control failure have been a central feature of human behavior. Psychologists have long argued that the use of self-control is an effortful process and, more recently, that its failure arises when the cognitive costs of self-control outweigh its perceived benefits. In a similar way, economists have argued that sophisticated choosers can adopt \"pre-commitment strategies\" that tie the hands of their future selves in order to reduce these costs. Yet, we still lack an empirical tool to quantify and demonstrate the cost of self-control. Here, we develop and validate a novel economic decision-making task to quantify the subjective cost of self-control by determining the monetary cost a person is willing to incur in order to eliminate the need for self-control. We find that humans will pay to avoid having to exert self-control in a way that scales with increasing levels of temptation and that these costs are modulated both by motivational incentives and stress exposure. Our psychophysical approach allows us to index moment-to-moment self-control costs at the within-subject level, validating important theoretical work across multiple disciplines and opening new avenues of self-control research in healthy and clinical populations.",

Apolipoprotein E (apoE) has emerged as a promising therapeutic target given its neuroprotective properties and ability to modify neuroinflammatory responses. We developed a 5-amino acid peptide, CN-105, that mimics the polar face of the apoE helical domain involved in receptor interactions, readily crosses the blood-brain barrier, and improves outcomes in well-established preclinical ICH models. In the current study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of CN-105 in translational ICH models that account for hypertensive comorbidity, sex, species, and age.\n\nMethodsIn three separate experiments, we delivered three intravenous doses of CN-105 (up to 0.20 mg/kg) or vehicle to hypertensive male BPH/2J mice, spontaneously hypertensive female rats, or 11-month old male mice within 24-hours of ICH. Neuropathological and neurobehavioral outcomes were determined over 3, 7, and 9 days, respectively.\n\nResultsIn spontaneously hypertensive male mice, there was a significant dose-dependent effect of CN-105 on vestibulomotor function at 0.05 and 0.20 mg/kg doses (p < 0.05; 95% CI: 0.91 - 153.70 and p < 0.001; 95% CI: 49.54 - 205.62), while 0.20 mg/kg also improved neuroseverity scores (p < 0.05; 95% CI: 0.27 - 11.00) and reduced ipsilateral brain edema (p < 0.05; 95% CI: -0.037 - -0.001).

    "abstract": "The analysis of brain-imaging data requires complex processing pipelines to support findings on brain function or pathologies. Recent work has shown that variability in analytical decisions, small amounts of noise, or computational environments can lead to substantial differences in the results, endangering the trust in conclusions1-7. We explored the instability of results by instrumenting a connectome estimation pipeline with Monte Carlo Arithmetic8,9 to introduce random noise throughout. We evaluated the reliability of the connectomes, their features10,11, and the impact on analysis12,13. The stability of results was found to range from perfectly stable to highly unstable. This paper highlights the potential of leveraging induced variance in estimates of brain connectivity to reduce the bias in networks alongside increasing the robustness of their applications in the classification of individual differences. We demonstrate that stability evaluations are necessary for understanding error inherent to brain imaging experiments, and how numerical analysis can be applied to typical analytical workflows both in brain imaging and other domains of computational science. Overall, while the extreme variability in results due to analytical instabilities could severely hamper our understanding of brain organization, it also leads to an increase in the reliability of datasets.",

All measures were assessed under CONTROL (no vibration) and ULV (30 Hz; 0.4 mm displacement) conditions while participants maintained a small contraction of the right flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle. To assess spinal pathways, Hoffmann reflexes (H-reflexes) elicited by stimulation of the median nerve were recorded from FCR with motor response (M-wave) amplitudes matched between conditions. An H-reflex conditioning paradigm was also used to assess changes in presynaptic inhibition by stimulating the superficial radial (SR) nerve (5 pulses at 300Hz) 37 ms prior to median nerve stimulation. Cutaneous reflexes in FCR elicited by stimulation of the SR nerve at the wrist were also recorded. To assess corticospinal pathways, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by transcranial magnetic stimulation of the contralateral motor cortex were recorded from the right FCR and biceps brachii (BB). ULV significantly reduced H-reflex amplitude by 15.7% for both conditioned and unconditioned reflexes (24.0{+/-}15.7 vs 18.4{+/-}11.2 % Mmax; p<0.05). Middle latency cutaneous reflexes were also significantly reduced by 20.0% from CONTROL (-1.50 {+/-} 2.1 % Mmax) to ULV (-1.73 {+/-} 2.2 % Mmax; p<0.05). There was no significant effect of ULV on MEP amplitude (p>0.05). Therefore, ULV inhibits cutaneous and H-reflex transmission without influencing corticospinal excitability of the forearm flexors suggesting increased presynaptic inhibition of afferent transmission as a likely mechanism. A general increase in inhibition of spinal pathways with ULV may have important implications for improving rehabilitation for individuals with spasticity (SCI, stroke, MS, etc).",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are the most abundant circulating white blood cells and are central players of the innate immune response. During their lifecycle, neutrophils mainly evolve under low oxygen conditions (0.1 - 4% O2) to which they are well adapted. Neutrophils are atypical cells since they are mainly glycolytic, and highly susceptible to oxygen-exposure, which induces their activation and death, through mechanisms which remain currently elusive. Nevertheless, nearly all studies conducted on neutrophils are carried out under atmospheric oxygen (21%), corresponding to hyperoxic conditions. Here we investigated the impact of hyperoxia during neutrophil purification and culture on neutrophil viability, activation and cytosolic protein content. Neutrophil hyper-activation (CD62L shedding) is induced during culture under hyperoxic conditions (24h), compared to neutrophils cultured under anoxic conditions. In addition, we show that maintaining neutrophils in autologous plasma is the most suitable strategy to maintain their basal state.\n\nOur results show that manipulating neutrophils under hyperoxic conditions leads to the loss of ~100 cytosolic proteins during purification, while it does not lead to an immediate impact on neutrophils activation (CD11bhigh, CD54high, CD62Llow) or viability (DAPI+). We identified two clusters of proteins belonging to the cholesterol metabolism and to the complement and coagulation cascade pathways, which are highly susceptible to neutrophil oxygen-exposure during their purification.\n\nIn conclusion, preserving neutrophil from oxygen-exposure during their manipulation - purification and culture- is recommended to avoid their experimental activation and for preserving a large set of cytosolic proteins from alteration.",

The impaired function of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator leads to abnormal epithelial Cl- / HCO3- transport and acidification of airway surface liquid. However, it remains unclear why Pseudomonas aeruginosa preferentially colonizes in the CF lungs. In this study, we carried out studies to investigate if lower pH helps Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapt and thrive in the CF-like acidic lung environment. Our results reveal that Pseudomonas aeruginosa generally forms more biofilm and induces antibiotic resistance faster in acidic conditions and that this can be reversed by returning the acidic environment to physiologically neutral conditions. Pseudomonas aeruginosa appears to be highly adaptive to the CF-like acidic pH environment. By studying the effects of an acidic environment on bacterial response, we may provide a new therapeutic option in preventing chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and colonization.",

Lack of arbovirus proliferation in midgut cells has been observed in several Aedes aegypti strains2, but the midgut antiviral responses underlying this phenomenon are not yet fully understood. We report here that there is a rapid induction of apoptosis (RIA) in the Aedes aegypti midgut epithelium within 2 hours of infection with DENV-2 or ZIKV in both in vivo blood-feeding and ex vivo midgut infection models.

    "abstract": "In Brazil, orally acquired T. cruzi infection has become the most relevant transmission mechanisms from public health perspective. Around 70% of new Chagas disease cases have been associated with consumption of contaminated food or beverages. Acai (Euterpe oleracea and Euterpe precatoria) is currently one of the most commercialized Amazonian fruits in the Brazilian and international markets. Therefore, it has become important to incorporate in the production process some procedures to measure out effective hygiene and product quality control required by global market. Molecular methods have been developed for rapid detection and quantification of T. cruzi DNA in several biological samples, including food matrices, for epidemiological investigation of Chagas disease and food quality control. However, a high-performance molecular methodology since DNA extraction until detection and quantification of T. cruzi DNA in acai berry pulp is still needed. Herein, a simple DNA extraction methodology was standardized from the supernatant of acai berry pulp stabilized in a Lysis buffer. In addition, a multiplex real time qPCR assay, targeting T. cruzi DNA and an Exogenous Internal Positive Control was developed and validated, using reference from all T. cruzi DTUs and commercial samples of acai pulp, from an endemic municipality with previous history of oral Chagas disease outbreak. Thus, a high-sensitivity qPCR assay, that could detect up to 0.01 parasite equivalents/mL in acai, was reached. As of the 45 commercial samples analyzed, 9 (20%) were positive for T. cruzi. This high-sensitive, fast and easy-to-use molecular assay is compatible with most of the laboratories involved in the investigations of oral Chagas disease outbreaks, representing an important tool to the epidemiology, control and surveillance of Chagas disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryOral transmission of Chagas disease has acquired an increasingly importance on the disease epidemiology. Most of the orally acquired Chagas Disease cases are related to the consumption of fresh foods or drinks, as sugar cane juice, acai berry pulp and bacaba wine, contaminated with triatomines or its feces. In Brazil, it has recently caused numerous outbreaks and has been linked to unusually severe acute infections. So far, the evaluation of the potential for oral transmission of Chagas disease through the consumption of acai-based products is mostly determined by clinical or parasitological methods. Despite the recent advances, a highly sensitive, reproductible and properly validated real time PCR assay for the molecular diagnostic of T. cruzi in acai pulp samples is still missing. Herein, a simple and reproducible multiplex real-time PCR assay was developed to the detection and quantification of T. cruzi DNA in acai pulp samples. This methodology, that includes a simple step for sample stabilization and DNA extraction based on silica-membrane spin columns, can be useful for analyzing orally transmitted acute Chagas disease outbreaks.",

    "abstract": "Initiation of DNA replication occurs at specialized regions along chromosomes called origins. The knowledge of replication origins is imperative to understand regulation of DNA replication. The properties of replication origins in the pathogenic budding yeast Candida albicans remain enigmatic in the absence of the knowledge of authentic chromosomal origins. Earlier, we identified centromere proximal (pCEN) chromosomal origins on chromosomes 5 and 7 of C. albicans. Here, we identify another centromere-distal (dCEN) chromosomal origin by two-dimensional agarose gel electrophoresis corresponding to a previously reported autonomously replicating sequence (ARS), CARS2. We show that all the identified chromosomal origins are bound by C. albicans homologs of conserved pre-replication complex proteins Orc2 and Mcm2. Previous reports from our lab and others have shown that there is a strong inter-relationship between centromere function and pericentric origin activity, suggesting that these origins are epigenetically regulated. However, we find that short intergenic regions corresponding to each of these origins functions as an ARS element in circular plasmids. Further, we use the novel strategy of in vivo gap repair to demonstrate that circular ARS plasmids can exist independently in vivo in C. albicans. Taken together, these results show that DNA sequence underlies the function of both centromere proximal and centromere distal chromosomal origins in C. albicans.",

    "abstract": "The adrenal gland and its hormones regulate numerous fundamental biological processes; however, the impact of hypoxia signalling on its function remains scarcely understood. Here, we reveal that deficiency of HIF (Hypoxia Inducible Factors) prolyl hydroxylase domain protein-2 (PHD2) in the adrenal medulla of mice results in HIF2-mediated reduction in phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) expression, and consequent reduction in epinephrine synthesis. Concomitant loss of PHD2 in renal erythropoietin (EPO) producing cells stimulated HIF2-driven EPO overproduction, excessive RBC formation (erythrocytosis) and systemic hypoglycaemia. Using mouse lines displaying only EPO-induced erythrocytosis or anaemia, we show that hypo- or hyperglycaemia is necessary and sufficient to respectively enhance or reduce exocytosis of epinephrine from the adrenal gland. Based on these results, we propose that the PHD2-HIF2 axis in the adrenal medulla and beyond regulates both synthesis and release of catecholamines, especially epinephrine. Our findings are also of great significance in view of the small molecule PHD inhibitors being tested in phase III global clinical development trials for use in renal anaemia patients.",

Cohesin extrudes DNA into loops that are thought to lengthen until CTCF boundaries are encountered. Little is known about whether loop extrusion is impeded by DNA-bound macromolecular machines. We demonstrate that the replicative helicase MCM is a barrier that restricts loop extrusion in G1 phase. Single-nucleus Hi-C of one-cell embryos revealed that MCM loading reduces CTCF-anchored loops and decreases TAD boundary insulation, suggesting loop extrusion is impeded before reaching CTCF. Single-molecule imaging shows that MCMs are physical barriers that frequently constrain cohesin translocation in vitro. Simulations are consistent with MCMs as abundant, random barriers. We conclude that distinct loop extrusion barriers contribute to shaping 3D genomes.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryMCM complexes are obstacles that impede the formation of CTCF-anchored loops.",

    "abstract": "Purine salvage from the host is an obligatory process for all protozoan parasites. In Leishmania donovani, this is accomplished by four membrane nucleoside and nucleobase transporters, or LdNTs. Previously, we demonstrated that purine starvation invokes a robust stress response in Leishmania and characterized the proteomic changes involved. However, because Leishmania do not control the transcription of individual genes, the underlying mechanisms responsible for these changes were ill-defined. LdNT1 and LdNT2 are among the most rapidly and significantly upregulated genes in purine-starved L. donovani parasites. Thus, to better understand post-transcriptional mechanisms of purine-responsive gene expression, we have examined regulation of these genes in molecular detail. Here we report that LdNT1 and LdNT2 are controlled by distinct cis-acting elements. In the case of LdNT2, mRNA abundance and translational enhancement under purine stress depend on a 76 nt-long polypyrimidine tract encoded in the LdNT2 mRNA 3-UTR. Transcripts containing the LdNT2 polypyrimidine tract were found to localize to discrete cytoplasmic foci in purine-replete cells, suggesting that the LdNT2 message may be stored in RNA granules at steady-state. In the case of LdNT1, we found that purine-responsiveness is conferred by a 48 nt-long polypyrimidine tract and additional upstream element, termed UE1. Both features are independently required for regulation, with the polypyrimidine tract and UE1 controlling mRNA abundance and translation, respectively. Together, these results highlight a remarkable degree of complexity in the regulation of the Leishmania purine stress response and set the stage for future investigations to identify the larger network of RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions involved.",

    "abstract": "The prediction of acid dissociation constants (pKa) is a prerequisite for predicting many other properties of a small molecule, such as its protein-ligand binding affinity, distribution coefficient (log D), membrane permeability, and solubility. The prediction of each of these properties requires knowledge of the relevant protonation states and solution free energy penalties of each state. The SAMPL6 pKa Challenge was the first time that a separate challenge was conducted for evaluating pKa predictions as part of the Statistical Assessment of Modeling of Proteins and Ligands (SAMPL) exercises. This challenge was motivated by significant inaccuracies observed in prior physical property prediction challenges, such as the SAMPL5 log D Challenge, caused by protonation state and pKa prediction issues. The goal of the pKa challenge was to assess the performance of contemporary pKa prediction methods for drug-like molecules. The challenge set was composed of 24 small molecules that resembled fragments of kinase inhibitors, a number of which were multiprotic. Eleven research groups contributed blind predictions for a total of 37 pKa distinct prediction methods. In addition to blinded submissions, four widely used pKa prediction methods were included in the analysis as reference methods. Collecting both microscopic and macroscopic pKa predictions allowed in-depth evaluation of pKa prediction performance. This article highlights deficiencies of typical pKa prediction evaluation approaches when the distinction between microscopic and macroscopic pKas is ignored; in particular, we suggest more stringent evaluation criteria for microscopic and macroscopic pKa predictions guided by the available experimental data. Top-performing submissions for macroscopic pKa predictions achieved RMSE of 0.7-1.0 pKa units and included both quantum chemical and empirical approaches, where the total number of extra or missing macroscopic pKas predicted by these submissions were fewer than 8 for 24 molecules. A large number of submissions had RMSE spanning 1-3 pKa units. Molecules with sulfur-containing heterocycles or iodo and bromo groups were less accurately predicted on average considering all methods evaluated. For a subset of molecules, we utilized experimentally-determined microstates based on NMR to evaluate the dominant tautomer predictions for each macroscopic state. Prediction of dominant tautomers was a major source of error for microscopic pKa predictions, especially errors in charged tautomers. The degree of inaccuracy in pKa predictions observed in this challenge is detrimental to the protein-ligand binding affinity predictions due to errors in dominant protonation state predictions and the calculation of free energy corrections for multiple protonation states. Underestimation of ligand pKa by 1 unit can lead to errors in binding free energy errors up to 1.2 kcal/mol. The SAMPL6 pKa Challenge demonstrated the need for improving pKa prediction methods for drug-like molecules, especially for challenging moieties and multiprotic molecules.",

    "abstract": "Gastric cancer is the third most common cancer in the world and Helicobacter spp. being one of the main factors responsible for development of cancer. Alongside Helicobacter the microbiota of the stomach mucosa may also play an important role in gastric cancer progression. Previously we had established that MyD88 deficient mice rapidly progressed to neoplasia when infected with H. felis. Thus, in order to assess the role of microbiota in gastric cancer progression we measured the changes in microbial diversity of the stomach in mice with different genotypic backgrounds (Wild type (WT), MyD88 deficient (MyD88-/-), mice deficient in the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon-{beta} (TRIF, Triflps2), and MyD88 and Trif deficient (MyD88-/- and Trif-/-)double knockout (DKO) mice), both in uninfected and Helicobacter infected mice and its correlation of these changes with gastric cancer progression. We observed that there was an overall reduction in microbial diversity post infection with H. felis across all genotypes. Campylobacterales were observed in all infected mice, with marked reduction in abundance at 3 and 6 months in MyD88-/- mice. This low abundance of H. pylori could facilitate dominance of other organisms of microbiome like Lactobacilliales. A sharp increase in Lactobacilliales in infected MyD88-/- and DKO mice at 3 and 6 months was observed as compared to Trif-/- and WT mice suggesting its possible role in gastric cancer progression. This was further reinforced upon comparison of Lactobacillus ratio with histological data suggesting that Lactobacillales is closely associated with Helicobacter infection and gastric cancer progression. Thus, this study firstly suggests that difference in genotypes could define the stomach microbiome and make it more susceptible to development of gastric cancer upon Helicobacter infections. Secondly the increase in Lactobacillales could contribute to faster development of gastric cancer and serve as a probable bio marker for fast progressing form of gastric cancer.",

However, the origin and significance of this phenomenon remain unclear. To unravel ASD connectopathy and relate it to underlying etiological heterogeneity, we carried out a bi-center cross-etiological investigation of fMRI-based connectivity in the mouse, in which specific ASD-relevant mutations can be isolated and modelled minimizing environmental contributions. By performing brain-wide connectivity mapping across 16 mouse mutants, we show that different ASD-associated etiologies cause a broad spectrum of connectional abnormalities in which diverse, often diverging, connectivity signatures are recognizable. Despite this heterogeneity, the identified connectivity alterations could be classified into four subtypes characterized by discrete signatures of network dysfunction. Our findings show that etiological variability is a key determinant of connectivity heterogeneity in ASD, hence reconciling conflicting findings in clinical populations. The identification of etiologically-relevant connectivity subtypes could improve diagnostic label accuracy in the non-syndromic ASD population and paves the way for personalized treatment approaches.",

    "abstract": "The synaptic inputs to single cortical neurons exhibit substantial diversity in their sensory-driven activity. What this diversity reflects is unclear, and appears counter-productive in generating selective somatic responses to specific stimuli. We propose that synaptic diversity arises because neurons decode information from upstream populations. Focusing on a single sensory variable, orientation, we construct a probabilistic decoder that estimates the stimulus orientation from the responses of a realistic, hypothetical input population of neurons. We provide a straightforward mapping from the decoder weights to real excitatory synapses, and find that optimal decoding requires diverse input weights. Analytically derived weights exhibit diversity whenever upstream input populations consist of noisy, correlated, and heterogeneous neurons, as is typically found in vivo. In fact, in silico weight diversity was necessary to accurately decode orientation and matched the functional heterogeneity of dendritic spines imaged in vivo. Our results indicate that synaptic diversity is a necessary component of information transmission and reframes studies of connectivity through the lens of probabilistic population codes. These results suggest that the mapping from synaptic inputs to somatic selectivity may not be directly interpretable without considering input covariance and highlights the importance of population codes in pursuit of the cortical connectome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCross-frequency coupling (CFC) refers to the non linear interaction between oscillations in different frequency bands, and it is a rather ubiquitous phenomenon that has been observed in a variety of physical and biophysical systems. In particular, the coupling between the phase of slow oscillations and the amplitude of fast oscillations, referred as phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), has been intensively explored in the brain activity recorded from animals and humans. However, the interpretation of these CFC patterns remains challenging since harmonic spectral correlations characterizing non sinusoidal oscillatory dynamics can act as a confounding factor.\n\nMethodsSpecialized signal processing techniques are proposed to address the complex interplay between spectral harmonicity and different types of CFC, not restricted only to PAC. For this, we provide an in-depth characterization of the Time Locked Index (TLI) as a novel tool aimed to efficiently quantify the harmonic content of noisy time series. It is shown that the proposed TLI measure is more robust and outperform traditional phase coherence metrics (e.g. Phase Locking Value, Pairwise Phase Consistency) in several aspects.\n\nResultsWe found that a non linear oscillator under the effect of additive noise can produce spurious CFC with low spectral harmonic content. On the other hand, two coupled oscillatory dynamics with independent fundamental frequencies can produce true CFC with high spectral harmonic content via a rectification mechanism or other post-interaction nonlinear processing mechanisms. These results reveal a complex interplay between CFC and harmonicity emerging in the dynamics of biologically plausible neural network models and more generic non linear and parametric oscillators.\n\nConclusionsWe show that, contrary to what is usually assumed in the literature, the high harmonic content observed in non sinusoidal oscillatory dynamics, is neither sufficient nor necessary condition to interpret the associated CFC patterns as epiphenomenal. There is mounting evidence suggesting that the combination of multimodal recordings, specialized signal processing techniques and theoretical modeling is becoming a required step to completely understand CFC patterns observed in oscillatory rich dynamics of physical and biophysical systems.\n\nHighlightsO_LITime locked index efficiently quantifies the harmonic content of noisy time series.\nC_LIO_LIA non linear oscillator under the effect of additive noise can produce spurious cross frequency couplings (CFC) with low spectral harmonic content.\nC_LIO_LITwo coupled oscillatory dynamics with independent fundamental frequencies can produce true CFC with high spectral harmonic content via rectification mechanisms or other post-interaction nonlinear processing mechanisms.\nC_LIO_LIA non sinusoidal oscillatory dynamics with high harmonic content is neither sufficient nor necessary condition for spurious CFC.\nC_LIO_LIA complex interplay between CFC and harmonicity emerges from the dynamics of nonlinear, parametric and biologically plausible oscillators.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Distributed population codes are ubiquitous in the brain and pose a challenge to downstream neurons that must learn an appropriate readout. Here we explore the possibility that this learning problem is simplified through inductive biases implemented by stimulus-independent noise correlations that constrain learning to task-relevant dimensions. We test this idea in a set of neural networks that learn to perform a perceptual discrimination task. Correlations among similarly tuned units were manipulated independently of overall population signal-to-noise ratio in order to test how the format of stored information affects learning. Higher noise correlations among similarly tuned units led to faster and more robust learning, favoring homogenous weights assigned to neurons within a functionally similar pool, and could emerge through Hebbian learning. When multiple discriminations were learned simultaneously, noise correlations across relevant feature dimensions sped learning whereas those across irrelevant feature dimensions slowed it. Our results complement existing theory on noise correlations by demonstrating that when such correlations are produced without significant degradation of the signal-to-noise ratio, they can improve the speed of readout learning by constraining it to appropriate dimensions.\n\nSignificance statementPositive noise correlations between similarly tuned neurons theoretically reduce the representational capacity of the brain, yet they are commonly observed, emerge dynamically in complex tasks, and persist even in well-trained animals. Here we show that such correlations, when embedded in a neural population with a fixed signal to noise ratio, can improve the speed and robustness with which an appropriate readout is learned. In a simple discrimination task such correlations can emerge naturally through Hebbian learning. In more complex tasks that require multiple discriminations, correlations between neurons that similarly encode the task-relevant feature improve learning by constraining it to the appropriate task dimension.",

    "abstract": "The free-living nematode C.elegans remains one of the most robust and flexible genetic systems for inter-rogating the complexities of animal biology. Targeted genetic manipulations, such as RNA interference (RNAi), CRISPR/Cas9- or array-based transgenesis, all depend on initial delivery of nucleic acids. Delivery of dsRNA by feeding can be effective, but expression in E. coli is not conducive to experiments intended to remain sterile or with defined microbial communities. Soaking-based delivery requires prolonged exposure of animals to high material concentrations without a food source and is of limited throughput. Last, microinjection of individual animals can precisely deliver materials to animals germlines, but is limited by the need to target and inject each animal one-by-one. Thus, we sought to address some of these challenges in nucleic acid delivery by developing a population-scale delivery method. We demonstrate efficient electroporation-mediated delivery of dsRNA throughout the worm and effective RNAi-based silencing, including in the germline. Finally, we show that guide RNA delivered by electroporation can be utilized by transgenic Cas9 expressing worms for population-scale genetic targeting. Together, these methods expand the scale and scope of genetic methodologies that can be applied to the C.elegans system.",

    "abstract": "The glucocorticoid (GR) and androgen (AR) receptors execute unique functions in vivo, yet have nearly identical DNA binding specificities. To identify mechanisms that facilitate functional diversification among these transcription factor paralogs, we studied AR and GR in an equivalent cellular context. Analysis of chromatin and sequence features suggest that divergent binding, and corresponding gene regulation, are driven by different abilities of AR and GR to interact with relatively inaccessible chromatin. Divergent genomic binding patterns can also be the results of subtle differences in DNA binding preference between AR and GR. Furthermore, the sequence composition of large regions (>10 kb) surrounding selectively occupied binding sites differs significantly, indicating a role for the sequence environment in selectively guiding AR and GR to distinct binding sites. The comparison of binding sites that are shared between AR and GR shows that the specificity paradox can also be resolved by differences in the events that occur downstream of receptor binding. Specifically, we find that shared binding sites display receptor-specific enhancer activity, cofactor recruitment and changes in histone modifications. Genomic deletion of shared binding sites demonstrates their contribution to directing receptor-specific gene regulation. Together, these data suggest that differences in genomic occupancy as well as divergence in the events that occur downstream of receptor binding direct functional diversification among transcription factor paralogs.",

We have compared the transcriptome after abolishing the assembly of new ribosomes and inhibiting the translocation of ribosomes on the mRNA.

    "abstract": "Postdoctoral training enables research independence and professional readiness. National reports have emphasized professional development as a critical component of this training period. In response, many institutions are establishing transferable skills training workshops for postdocs; however, the lack of structured programs and an absence of methods to assess outcomes beyond participant satisfaction surveys are critical gaps in postdoctoral training. To address these shortcomings, we took the approach of structured programming and developed a method for controlled assessment of outcomes. Our program You3 (You, Your Team, Your Project), co-designed by postdoctoral fellows, focused on a structured array of management and leadership skills agnostic of ultimate career path(s). We then measured outcomes in a controlled manner, by systematically comparing perceived knowledge and growth of participants with non-participants as the control group. You3 participants discern greater growth, independent of number of years in training, in competencies overall compared to the control group. This growth was shown by multiple criteria including self-reporting and associative analysis. Correspondingly, You3 participants reported greater knowledge in 75% of the modules when compared to controls. These data indicate that structured learning, where postdocs commit to a curriculum via a cohort-structure, leads to positive outcomes and provides a framework for programs to assess outcomes in a rigorous manner.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAllergic asthma is a worldwide health problem, and its etiology remains incompletely understood. Besides, as current therapies for allergic asthma mainly rely on administration of glucocorticoids and have many side effects, new therapy is needed. You-Gui-Wan (YGW), a traditional Chinese herbal remedy, has been used for boosting Yang, enhancing immunity and treating allergic asthma.\n\nObjectivesThis study aims to explore the molecular changes during the development of allergic asthma and investigate the potential bio-signatures and the effect of YGW on house dust mite (HDM)-induced chronic allergic asthma in mice.\n\nMethodsDermatophagoides pteronyssinus (Der p), one of HDMs, was intratracheally administered once a week for a total of 7 treatments over 6 consecutive weeks to induce allergic asthma in mice. Serum metabolomics was analyzed by LC-QTOF-MS/MS. 16S rRNA-based microbiome profiling was used to analyze gut microbiota, and the correlation between metabolomic signatures and microbial community profiling was explored by Spearman correlation analysis.\n\nResultsSerum metabolomic analysis revealed that 10 identified metabolites -- acetylcarnitine, carnitine, hypoxanthine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, norleucine, isoleucine, betaine, methionine, and valine, were markedly elevated by Der p. These metabolites are mainly related to branch-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism, aromatic amino acid (AAA) biosynthesis, and phenylalanine metabolism. YGW administration reversed 7 of the 10 identified metabolites and chiefly affected BCAA metabolism. 16S DNA sequencing revealed that YGW profoundly changed Der p-induced gut microbiota composition. Multiple correlation analysis indicated 10 selected metabolites have a good correlation with gut microbiota.\n\nConclusionDer p induced BCAA metabolic deviation in allergic asthma mice, and YGW administration effectively ameliorated the AA metabolic disorder, and improved gut dysbiosis. This study paves the way towards the interactions of Der-p on microbiome and gut microbiota, and the effects of YGW treatment as well as provides a support for YGW administration with potential benefits for allergic asthma.",

Firstly, we confirmed our prior findings of increased daily activity and reduced activity fragmentation in Usp2 KO mice. Further, mice lacking USP2 showed impaired motor coordination and equilibrium, a decrease in anxiety-like behavior, a deficit in short-term recognition memory and in sensorimotor gating. On the other hand, no effects of Usp2 gene deletion were found on spatial memory. Hence, our data uncover the implication of USP2 in different behaviors and expands the range of the known functions of this deubiquitinase.",

Streptococcus mutans is considered as the main bacteria involve in dental decay, while the level of Lactobacillus spp. is directly related to the presence or onset of caries. Commiphora myrrha is an ancient plant which extracts are used as antiseptic and anti-inflammatory for mouth and throat due to it is antimicrobial activity. This study assessed the impact of Commiphora myrrha on two bacteria Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. involved in dental caries. Three samples of Streptococcus mutans bacteria were collected randomly from patients with dental caries in Khartoum dental teaching hospital, while Lactobacillus spp. were obtained from fermented milk. Disk and well diffusion methods were used to test the effect of four concentration (100,50,25 and 12.5 mg/ml) of Myrrha volatile oil, extracted by hydro-distillation technique. The biochemical analysis of Commiphora myrrha oil was carried out using Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrophotometric technique. The finding revealed that the four concentrations of oil were effective on Streptococcus mutans with the largest inhibition zone (18.7{+/-} 0.6 mm) through the well diffusion method and inhibition zone of (14.00 mm) with disc diffusion method regardless the two methods these inhibition zones were recorded at 100 mg/ml, with Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) at 3.125 mg/ml. While Lactobacillus spp. bacteria sensitive to three concentrations (100,50 and 25 mg/ml) and resistance to concentration 12.5 mg/ml, it is MBC found to be 25 mg/ml. In conclusion, this research revealed that Myrrh oil is effective on both S.mutans and Lactobacillus spp. Hence, Myrrha oil is a potential antibacterial product of interest in dental caries.",

A quantitative glycoproteomics strategy was deployed to identify cellular substrates of the UGGTs at endogenous levels in CRISPR-edited HEK293 cells. The seventy-one UGGT substrates identified were mainly large multidomain and heavily glycosylated proteins when compared to the general N-glycome.

We combine actual data from various scientific disciplines (including structural biology, cell biology and multiple microscopic techniques) and apply artistic expression and design aesthetics to create a unique new experience where a real-time virtual explorer can traverse a cell surface, observe and interact with a more scientifically accurate cell surface environment.",

    "abstract": "Tumour cell heterogeneity is a major barrier for efficient design of targeted anti-cancer therapies. A diverse distribution of phenotypically distinct tumour-cell subpopulations prior to drug treatment predisposes to non-uniform responses, leading to the elimination of sensitive cancer cells whilst leaving resistant subpopulations unharmed. Few strategies have been proposed for quantifying the variability associated to individual cancer-cell heterogeneity and minimizing its undesirable impact on clinical outcomes. Here, we report a computational approach that allows the rational design of combinatorial therapies involving epigenetic drugs against chromatin modifiers. We have formulated a stochastic model of a bivalent transcription factor that allows us to characterise three different qualitative behaviours, namely: bistable, high- and low-gene expression. Comparison between analytical results and experimental data determined that the so-called bistable and high-gene expression behaviours can be identified with undifferentiated and differentiated cell types, respectively. Since undifferentiated cells with an aberrant self-renewing potential might exhibit a cancer/metastasis-initiating phenotype, we analysed the efficiency of combining epigenetic drugs against the background of heterogeneity within the bistable sub-ensemble. Whereas single-targeted approaches mostly failed to circumvent the therapeutic problems represented by tumour heterogeneity, combinatorial strategies fared much better. Specifically, the more successful combinations were predicted to involve modulators of the histone H3K4 and H3K27 demethylases KDM5 and KDM6A/UTX. Those strategies involving the H3K4 and H3K27 methyltransferases MLL2 and EZH2, however, were predicted to be less effective. Our theoretical framework provides a coherent basis for the development of an in-silico platform capable of identifying the epigenetic drugs combinations best-suited to therapeutically manage non-uniform responses of heterogenous cancer cell populations.\n\nAuthor summaryHeterogeneity in cancer cell populations is one of the main engines of resistance to targeted therapies, as it induces nonuniform responses within the population that clears the sensitive subpopulation, whilst leaving unaffected the non-responsive cells. Although this is a well-known fact, few successful approaches have been proposed aimed at both quantifying the variability associated to cell heterogeneity, and characterising strategies that circumvent its drug-resistance inducing effects. Here we present a computational approach that addresses these issues in the particular context of targeting epigenetic regulators (specifically, chromatin modifiers), which have been proposed as therapeutic targets in several types of cancer and also in ageing-related diseases. Our model predicts that the more successful combinations involve modulators of demethylase activity (specifically, KDM5/6 and UTX). By contrast, strategies involving EZH2 activity are predicted to be less effective. Our results support the use of our framework as a platform for in silico drug trials, as it accounts for non-homogeneous response of cell populations to drugs as well as identifying which subpopulations are more likely to respond to specific strategies.",

    "abstract": "Many digestive disorders have prominent sex differences in incidence, symptomatology, and treatment response that are not well understood. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), for example, affects approximately 10% of the population worldwide and tends to have different manifestations in males and females. Androgens are steroid hormones present at much higher levels in post-pubertal males than females and could be involved in these sex differences, but their normal functions in the bowel are largely unknown. Here, we show that gonadal androgens are required for normal gastrointestinal motility in vivo. In the healthy mouse gut, we detected androgen receptors in smooth muscle cells and a subset of enteric neurons. Surgical or genetic disruption of androgen signaling in adult mice selectively and reversibly altered colonic motility by affecting neurons rather than smooth muscle. To determine if androgens also influence human bowel function, we measured androgen levels in 208 adults with IBS. Free testosterone levels were lower in patients with IBS compared to healthy controls and inversely correlated with symptom severity. Taken together, these observations establish a role for androgens in the regulation of colonic motility and link altered androgen signaling with a common digestive disorder. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of gut motility, with implications for normal aging and disorders involving the gut-brain axis.",
