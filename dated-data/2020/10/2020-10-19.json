    "abstract": "The deeper understanding of metastasis phenomenon and detection of drug targets could be a potential approach to minimize cancer mortality. In this study, attempts were taken to unmask novel therapeutics to prevent metastasis and cancer progression. Initially, we explored the physiochemical, structural and functional insights of three metastasis tumor antigens (MTAs) and evaluated some plant based bioactive compounds as potent MTA inhibitors. From 50 plant metabolites screened, isoflavone, gingerol, citronellal and asiatic acid showed maximum binding affinity with all three MTA proteins. The ADME analysis detected no undesirable toxicity that could reduce the drug likeness properties of top plant metabolites. Moreover, molecular dynamics studies revealed that the complexes were stable and showed minimum fluctuation at molecular level. We further performed ligand based virtual screening to identify similar drug molecules using a large collection of 3,76,342 compounds from DrugBank. The results suggested that several structural analogs (e.g. Tramadol, Nabumetone, DGLA, Hydrocortisone) may act as agonist to block the MTA proteins and inhibit cancer progression at early stage. The study could be useful to develop effective medications against cancer metastasis in future. Due to encouraging results, we highly recommend further in vitro and in vivo trials for the experimental validation of the findings.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFacing the diversity of omic data and the difficulty of selecting one result over all those produced by several methods, consensus strategies have the potential to reconcile multiple inputs and to produce robust results.\n\nResultsHere, we introduce ClustOmics, a generic consensus clustering tool that we use in the context of cancer subtyping. ClustOmics relies on a non-relational graph database, which allows for the simultaneous integration of both multiple omic data and results from various clustering methods. This new tool conciliates input clusterings, regardless of their origin, their number, their size or their shape. ClustOmics implements an intuitive and flexible strategy, based upon the idea of evidence accumulation clustering. It computes co-occurrences of pairs of samples in input clusters and uses this score as a similarity measure to reorganise data into consensus clusters.\n\nConclusionWe applied ClustOmics to multi-omic disease subtyping on real TCGA cancer data from ten different cancer types. We showed that ClustOmics is robust to heterogeneous qualities of input partitions, smoothing and reconciling preliminary predictions into high quality consensus clusters, both from a computational and a biological point of view. The comparison to a state-of-the-art consensus based integration tool, COCA, further corroborated this statement. However, the main interest of ClustOmics is not to compete with other tools, but rather to make profit from their various predictions when no gold-standard metric is available to assess their significance.\n\nAvailabilityClustOmics source code, released under MIT licence, as well as the results obtained on TCGA cancer data are available on Github: https://github.com/galadrielbriere/ClustOmics.",

    "abstract": "Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are extracellular proteoglycans with many O-linked glycan chains. Precursors to many AGPs contain a C-terminal signal for the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor, but the role of this modification has not been elucidated. NtAGP1, a tobacco precursor to AGP, comprises a signal peptide, an AGP-coding region, and a GPI-anchoring signal, and it is classified as a member of the classical AGP family. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) and sweet potato sporamin (SPO) as tags and tobacco BY-2 cells as the host, we analysed the transport and modification of NtAGP1. The fusion protein of GFP or SPO and NtAGP1 expressed in BY-2 cells migrated as a large smear on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. A confocal microscopic analysis indicated that the GFP and NtAGP1 fusion protein localized to the plasma membrane (PM) and intracellular structures. Fractionation studies of microsomes indicated that most of the fusion protein of SPO and NtAGP1 (SPO-AGP) localized to the PM. In contrast, the expression of mutants without a GPI-anchoring signal yielded several forms. The largest forms migrating as large smears on the gel were secreted into the culture medium, whereas other forms were recovered in the endomembrane organelles. A comparison of the glycan structures of the microsomal SPO-AGP and the secreted mutant SPO-AGP without a GPI-anchoring signal using antibodies against AGP glycan epitopes indicated that the glycan structures of these proteins differ. These observations indicate that a GPI-anchoring signal is required for both the proper transport and glycosylation of the AGP precursor.",

Resin-based vascular corrosion casting, scanning electron microscopy, synchrotron radiation and desktop {micro}CT imaging, and computational network analysis are used. Combining these methods enables detailed visualization and quantification of the three-dimensional (3D) brain vasculature. Network features such as vascular volume fraction, branch point density, vessel diameter, - length, -tortuosity, and -directionality as well as extravascular distance can be obtained at any developmental stage from the early postnatal to the adult brain. Our method allows characterizing brain vascular networks separately for capillaries and non-capillaries.\n\nThe entire protocol, from mouse perfusion to vessel network analysis, takes approximately 10 days.\n\nOnline summaryThis protocol uses vascular corrosion casting, hierarchical synchrotron radiation {micro}CT imaging, and computational image analysis to assess the three-dimensional vascular network architecture.",

    "abstract": "Child abuse (CA) is a strong predictor of psychopathologies and suicide, altering normal trajectories of brain development in areas closely linked to emotional responses such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Yet, the cellular underpinnings of these enduring effects are unclear. Childhood and adolescence are marked by the protracted formation of perineuronal nets (PNNs), which orchestrate the closure of developmental windows of cortical plasticity by regulating the functional integration of parvalbumin interneurons (PV) into neuronal circuits. Using well-characterized post-mortem brain samples, we show that a history of CA is specifically associated with increased densities and morphological complexity of WFL-labeled PNNs in the ventromedial PFC (BA11/12), possibly suggesting increased recruitment and maturation of PNNs. Through single-nucleus sequencing and fluorescent in-situ hybridization, we found that the expression of canonical components of PNNs is enriched in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), and that they are upregulated in CA victims. These correlational findings suggest that early-life adversity may lead to persistent patterns of maladaptive behaviors by reducing the neuroplasticity of cortical circuits through the enhancement of developmental OPC-mediated PNN formation.",

The importance of these platforms in clinical and translational studies led us to investigate the impact of delayed blood processing on the numbers and state of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and on the plasma proteome. Similar to previous studies, we show minimal effects of delayed processing on the numbers and general phenotype of PBMCs up to 18 hours. In contrast, profound changes in the single-cell transcriptome and composition of the plasma proteome become evident as early as 6 hours after blood draw. These reflect patterns of cellular activation across diverse cell types that lead to progressive distancing of the gene expression state and plasma proteome from native in vivo biology. Differences accumulating during an overnight rest (18 hours) could confound relevant biologic variance related to many underlying disease states.",

    "abstract": "Collateral sensitivity (CS), which arises when resistance to one antibiotic increases sensitivity towards other antibiotics, offers novel treatment opportunities to constrain or reverse the evolution of antibiotic-resistance. The applicability of CS-informed treatments remains uncertain, in part because we lack an understanding of the generality of CS effects for different resistance mutations, singly or in combination. Here we address this issue in the Gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae by measuring collateral and fitness effects of clinically relevant gyrA and parC alleles, and their combinations, that confer resistance to fluoroquinolones. We integrated these results in a mathematical model which allowed us to evaluate how different in silico combination treatments impact the dynamics of resistance evolution. We identified common and conserved CS effects of different gyrA and parC alleles; however, the spectrum of collateral effects was unique for each allele or allelic pair. This indicated that allelic identity can impact the evolutionary dynamics of resistance evolution during monotreatment and combination treatment. Our model simulations, which included the experimentally derived antibiotic susceptibilities and fitness effects, and antibiotic specific pharmacodynamics, revealed that both collateral and fitness effects impact the population dynamics of resistance evolution. Overall, we provide evidence that allelic identity and interactions can have a pronounced impact on collateral effects to different antibiotics and suggest that these need to be considered in models examining CS-based therapies.\n\nSignificanceA promising strategy to overcome the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria is to use collateral sensitivity-informed antibiotic treatments that rely on cycling or mixing of antibiotics, such that that resistance towards one antibiotic confers increased sensitivity to the other. Here, focusing on multi-step fluoroquinolone resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae, we show that antibiotic-resistance induces diverse collateral responses whose magnitude and direction are determined by allelic identity. Using mathematical simulations, we show that these effects can be exploited via combination treatment regimens to suppress the de novo emergence of resistance during treatment.",

Herein the mutational status of 611 genomes from India along with their impact on proteins was ascertained.

The most prevalent reference nucleotide was C (209) and substituted one was T (293). NSP3 had the highest incidence of 101 sites followed by S protein (74 sites), NSP12b (43 sites) and ORF3a (31 sites). The average number of mutations per sample for males and females was 2.56 and 2.88 respectively suggesting a higher contribution of mutations from females. Non-uniform geographical distribution of mutations implied by Odisha (30 samples, 109 mutations) and Tamil Nadu (31 samples, 40 mutations) suggests that sequences in some regions are mutating faster than others. There were 281 mutations (198  Neutral and 83  Disease) affecting amino acid sequence. NSP13 has a maximum of 14  Disease variants followed by S protein and ORF3a with 13 each. Further, constitution of  Disease mutations in genomes from asymptomatic people was mere 11% but those from deceased patients was over three folds higher at 38% indicating contribution of these mutations to the pathophysiology of the SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies identified cyclase-associated proteins (CAPs) as important regulators of actin dynamics that control assembly and disassembly of actin filaments (F-actin). While these studies significantly advanced our knowledge of their molecular functions, the physiological relevance of CAPs largely remained elusive. Gene targeting in mice implicated CAP2 in heart physiology and skeletal muscle development. Heart defects in CAP2 mutant mice were associated with altered activity of serum response factor (SRF), a transcription factor involved in multiple biological processes including heart function, but also skeletal muscle development. By exploiting mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from CAP2 mutant mice, we aimed at deciphering the CAP2-dependent mechanism relevant for SRF activity. Reporter assays and mRNA quantification by qPCR revealed reduced SRF-dependent gene expression in mutant MEFs. Reduced SRF activity was associated with moderately increased G-actin levels and reduced nuclear levels of MRTF-A, a transcriptional SRF coactivator that is shuttled out of the nucleus and, hence, inhibited upon G-actin binding. Moreover, pharmacological actin manipulation restored MRTF-A distribution in mutant MEFs. Our data are in line with a model in which CAP2 controls the MRTF-SRF pathway in an actin-dependent manner. While MRTF-A localization and SRF activity was impaired under basal conditions, serum stimulation induced nuclear MRTF-A translocation and SRF activity in mutant MEFs similar to controls. In summary, our data revealed that in MEFs CAP2 controls basal MRTF-A localization and SRF activity, while it was dispensable for serum-induced nuclear MRTF-A translocation and SRF stimulation.",

However, most such models consider resistance emergence via a single mutational step. Here, we assembled experimental evidence that drug resistance evolution follows two patterns: i) a single mutation, which provides a large MIC increase, or ii) multiple mutations, each conferring a small increase, which combine to yield high-level resistance. Using stochastic modeling we then investigated the consequences of these two patterns for treatment failure and population diversity under various treatments. We find that resistance evolution is substantially limited if more than two mutations are required and that the most efficacious drug type depends on the pharmacokinetic profile. Further, we demonstrate that, for resistance evolution in multiple steps, adaptive treatment, which only suppresses the bacterial population, is favored over aggressive treatment, which aims at eradication.",

It enables identification of patients who may be at higher risk than others to COVID-19-related mortality, due to their genetic architecture, or who might respond better to a COVID-19 treatment. The COVID-19 virus, similar to SARS-CoV, uses the ACE2 receptor for cell entry and employs the cellular serine protease TMPRSS2 for viral S protein priming. This study aspires to present a multi-omics view of how variations in the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes affect COVID-19 infection and disease progression in affected individuals. It reports, for both genes, several variant and gene expression analysis findings, through (i) comparison analysis over single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that may account for the difference of COVID-19 manifestations among global sub-populations; (ii) calculating prevalence of structural variations (copy number variations (CNVs) / insertions), amongst populations; and (iii) studying expression patterns stratified by gender and age, over all human tissues.

    "abstract": "Novel biophysical tools allow the structural dynamics of proteins, and the regulation of such dynamics by binding partners, to be explored in unprecedented detail. Although this has provided critical insights into protein function, the means by which structural dynamics direct protein evolution remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated how proteins with a bilobed structure, composed of two related domains from the type-II periplasmic binding protein domain family, have undergone divergent evolution leading to modification of their structural dynamics and function. We performed a structural analysis of ~600 bilobed proteins with a common primordial structural core, which we complemented with biophysical studies to explore the structural dynamics of selected examples by single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer and Hydrogen-Deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. We show that evolutionary modifications of the structural core, largely at its termini, enables distinct structural dynamics, allowing the diversification of these proteins into transcription factors, enzymes, and extra-cytoplasmic transport-related proteins. Structural embellishments of the core created new interdomain interactions that stabilized structural states, reshaping the active site geometry, and ultimately, altered substrate specificity. Our findings reveal an as yet unrecognized mechanism for the emergence of functional promiscuity during long periods of protein evolution and are applicable to a large number of domain architectures.",

    "abstract": "WHIRLY1 in barley was shown to be a major architect of plastid nucleoids. Its accumulation in cells of E. coli coincided with an induction of nucleoid compaction and growth retardation. While WHIRLY1 of maize had similar effects on E. coli cells, WHIRLY1 proteins of Arabidopsis and potato a well as WHIRLY2 proteins had no impact on nucleoid compaction in E. coli. By mutagenesis of HvWHIRLY1 the PRAPP motif at the N-terminus preceding the highly conserved WHIRLY domain was identified to be responsible for the nucleoid compacting activity of HvWHIRLY1 in bacteria. This motif is found in WHIRLY1 proteins of most members of the Poaceae family, but neither in the WHIRLY2 proteins of the family nor in any WHIRLY protein of eudicot species such as Arabidopsis thaliana. This finding indicates that a subset of the monocot WHIRLY1 proteins has acquired a specific function as nucleoid compacters by sequence variation in the N-terminal part preceding the conserved WHIRLY domain and that in different groups of higher plants the compaction of nucleoids is mediated by other proteins.",

    "abstract": "Natural hibernation sites used by bats in areas that lack cave features have long remained unresolved. To investigate hibernation site selection and winter activity of boreal bats, we recorded bat calls using passive acoustic monitoring on 16 sites. These sites included four rock outcrops with crevices and cave features, three glacial erratics or boulder fields, three ancient shores, three root cellars and three control sites where we did not expect bats to be overwintering. Our results revealed echolocation calls of Eptesicus nilssonii, Plecotus auritus and Myotis sp. We recorded significantly more activity near rock outcrops and root cellars compared to other habitats. We also found that ambient temperature had a positive effect on bat activity and found evidence that P. auritus may be using low barometric pressure as a proxy for suitable foraging conditions during the winter. Our results suggest that rock outcrops may be more important to bats than previously acknowledged, highlighting the need to take these sites in account in planning of conservation measures. Furthermore, our findings underline the suitability of using acoustic monitoring in homing on hibernation sites that are not otherwise accessible.",

While rodents are less dexterous than primates, they provide powerful models for testing neural circuit function in behavioral output, including dexterous behaviors. In rodents, the single pellet reach task has been used extensively to study both dexterous forelimb motor learning as well as recovery from injury; however, mice exhibit high variability in task acquisition in comparison to rats and a significant percentage fail to learn the task. We have created a recessed version of the task that requires greater dexterity. This subtle modification increases both task difficulty as well as the proportion of mice that show an improvement with training. Furthermore, motor cortex inactivation shows a greater effect on the execution of the recessed forelimb reach task, with distinct effects on reach targeting vs grasping components depending on the timing of inhibitory activation. Kinematic analysis revealed differences in reach targeting upon transient cortical inhibition prior to reach onset. In summary, the recessed single pellet reach task provides a robust assessment of forelimb dexterity in mice and a tool for studying skilled motor acquisition and execution.",

    "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy is a promising new approach for cancer treatment. We propose to use a new host immunological pathway: TH{beta} immunity for cancer treatment. TH{beta} immunity is a natural host immunity which can be used IFN-/{beta} and its major effectors are IL-10 and IL-15. Thus, we here used these cytokines for treatment both in a mice breast cancer 4T1 model and in a neuroblastoma NXS2 model. 4T1 cells and NXS2 cells were inoculated subcutaneously to wild type BALB/c female mice and AJ mice, respectively. Both Cytokines and an antibody treatment with variable dosages were given. Our results show that IL-10 and IL-15 treatments have significant effects on not only tumor volume shrinkage and but also on mice survival. However, IFN-{gamma} even worsens the tumor volume and mice survival. Antibodies plus IL-10 is no better than IL-10 alone for cancer immunotherapy. This can be due to GD2 antigen expression on immune cells. Moreover, an anti-GD2 antibody could harm immune cells themselves. We found that IL-10 has direct toxicity on tumor cells in vitro. Our results conclude that using TH{beta} immunity is a good strategy for cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "RationaleVascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysregulation is a hallmark of vascular disease, including atherosclerosis. In particular, the majority of cells within atherosclerotic lesions are generated from pre-existing VSMCs and a clonal nature has been documented for VSMC-derived cells in multiple disease models. However, the mechanisms underlying the generation of oligoclonal lesions and the phenotype of proliferating VSMCs are unknown.\n\nObjectiveTo understand the cellular mechanisms underlying clonal VSMC expansion in disease.\n\nMethods and ResultsHere we analyse clonal dynamics in multi-color lineage-traced animals over time after vessel injury. We demonstrate that VSMC proliferation is initiated in a small fraction of VSMCs that initially expand clonally in the medial layer and then migrate to form the oligoclonal neointima. Selective activation of VSMC proliferation also occurs in vitro, suggesting that this is a cell-autonomous feature. Mapping of VSMC trajectories using single-cell RNA-sequencing reveals a continuum of cellular states after injury and suggests that VSMC proliferation initiates in cells that have downregulated the contractile phenotype and show evidence of pronounced phenotypic switching. We show that proliferation is associated with induced expression of stem cell antigen 1 (SCA1) and the expression signature previously identified in SCA1+ VSMCs in healthy arteries. A remarkably increased proliferation of SCA1+ VSMCs, directly validated in functional assays, indicates that SCA1+ VSMCs act as \"first responders\" in vascular injury. Early atherosclerotic lesions also had clonal VSMC contribution and we show that the proliferation-associated injury response is conserved in plaque VSMCs, extending these findings to atherosclerosis. Finally, we identify VSMCs in healthy human arteries that correspond to the SCA1+ state in mouse VSMCs and show that genes identified as differentially expressed in this human VSMC subpopulation are enriched for genes showing genetic association with cardiovascular disease.\n\nConclusionsWe show that cell-intrinsic, selective VSMC activation drives clonal proliferation after injury and in atherosclerosis. Our study suggests that healthy mouse and human arteries contain VSMCs characterised by expression of disease-associated genes that are predisposed for proliferation. Targeting such \"first responder\" cells in patients undergoing vascular surgery could effectively prevent injury-associated VSMC activation and neoatherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Cohesin is a multiprotein complex made up of core subunits Smc1, Smc3 and Rad21, and either Stag1 or Stag2. Normal haematopoietic development relies on crucial functions of cohesin in cell division and regulation of gene expression via three-dimensional chromatin organisation. Cohesin subunit STAG2 is frequently mutated in myeloid malignancies, but the individual contributions of Stag variants to haematopoiesis or malignancy are not fully understood. Zebrafish have four Stag paralogues (Stag1a, Stag1b, Stag2a and Stag2b), allowing detailed genetic dissection of the contribution of Stag1-cohesin and Stag2-cohesin to development. Here we characterize for the first time the expression patterns and functions of zebrafish stag genes during embryogenesis. Using loss-of-function CRISPR-Cas9 zebrafish mutants, we show that stag1a and stag2b contribute to primitive embryonic haematopoiesis. Both stag1a and stag2b mutants present with erythropenia by 24 hours post-fertilisation. Homozygous loss of either paralog alters the number of haematopoietic/vascular progenitors in the lateral plate mesoderm. The lateral plate mesoderm zone of scl-positive cells is expanded in stag1a mutants with concomitant loss of kidney progenitors, and the number of spi1-positive cells are increased, consistent with skewing toward primitive myelopoiesis. In contrast, stag2b mutants have reduced haematopoietic/vascular mesoderm and downregulation of primitive erythropoiesis. Our results suggest that Stag1 and Stag2 proteins cooperate to balance the production of primitive haematopoietic/vascular progenitors from mesoderm.",

    "abstract": "Protein components of the invertebrate occluding junction - known as the septate junction (SJ) - are required for morphogenetic developmental events during embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster. In order to determine whether SJ proteins are similarly required for morphogenesis during other developmental stages, we investigated the localization and requirement of four representative SJ proteins during oogenesis: Contactin, Macroglobulin complement-related, Neurexin IV, and Coracle. A number of morphogenetic processes occur during oogenesis, including egg elongation, formation of dorsal appendages, and border cell migration. We found that all four SJ proteins are expressed in egg chambers throughout oogenesis, with the highest and most sustained levels in the follicular epithelium (FE). In the FE, SJ proteins localize along the lateral membrane during early and mid-oogenesis, but become enriched in an apical-lateral domain (the presumptive SJ) by stage 10b. SJ protein relocalization requires the expression of other SJ proteins, as well as rab5 and rab11 in a manner similar to SJ biogenesis in the embryo. Knocking down the expression of these SJ proteins in follicle cells throughout oogenesis results in egg elongation defects and abnormal dorsal appendages. Similarly, reducing the expression of SJ genes in the border cell cluster results in border cell migration defects. Together, these results demonstrate an essential requirement for SJ genes in morphogenesis during oogenesis, and suggests that SJ proteins may have conserved functions in epithelial morphogenesis across developmental stages.\n\nArticle SummarySeptate junction (SJ) proteins are essential for forming an occluding junction in epithelial tissues of Drosophila melanogaster, and also for morphogenetic events that occur prior to the formation of the junction during embryogenesis. Here we show that SJ proteins are expressed in the follicular epithelium of egg chambers during oogenesis and are required for morphogenetic events including egg elongation, dorsal appendages formation, and border cell migration. Additionally, the formation of SJs during oogenesis is similar to that in embryonic epithelia.",

Epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) function is critical to systems responsible for extracellular fluid homeostasis and gas exchange.

We found that proximal and distal polybasic tracts in ENaC subunits coevolved, consistent with the dual cleavage requirement for activation observed in mammals. Polybasic tract pairs evolved with the terrestrial migration and the appearance of lungs, coincident with the ENaC activator aldosterone, and appeared independently in the  and {gamma} subunits. In summary, sites within ENaC for protease activation developed in vertebrates when renal Na+ conservation and alveolar gas exchange was required for terrestrial survival.",

While patterns of genome reduction have been well described in some terrestrial symbioses, they are less understood in marine systems where vertical transmission is relatively rare.

Differences in nitrogen and sulfur physiology between the two dominant symbiont groups, Ca. Ruthia and Ca.

However, genomic data are currently limited to confirm this assumption. In the present study we sequenced and compared 11 vesicomyid symbiont genomes with existing assemblies for Ca. Vesicomyosocius okutanii and Ca. Ruthia magnifica. Our analyses indicate that the two vesicomyid symbiont groups have a common core genome related to chemosynthetic metabolism, but differ in their potential for nitrate respiration and flexibility to environmental sulfide concentrations. Moreover, Ca. Vesicomyosocius and Ca. Ruthia have different enzymatic requirements for cobalamin and nickel and show contrasting capacities to acquire foreign genetic material. Tests for site-specific positive selection in metabolic candidate genes imply that the observed physiological differences are adaptive and thus likely correspond to ecological niches available to each symbiont group.

However, genomic data are currently limited to confirm this assumption. In the present study we sequenced and compared 11 vesicomyid symbiont genomes with existing assemblies for Ca. Vesicomyosocius okutanii and Ca. Ruthia magnifica. Our analyses indicate that the two vesicomyid symbiont groups have a common core genome related to chemosynthetic metabolism, but differ in their potential for nitrate respiration and flexibility to environmental sulfide concentrations. Moreover, Ca. Vesicomyosocius and Ca. Ruthia have different enzymatic requirements for cobalamin and nickel and show contrasting capacities to acquire foreign genetic material. Tests for site-specific positive selection in metabolic candidate genes imply that the observed physiological differences are adaptive and thus likely correspond to ecological niches available to each symbiont group. These findings highlight the role of niche differentiation in creating divergent paths of reductive genome evolution in vertically transmitted symbionts.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a rapidly emerging and highly transmissible disease caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Understanding the microbiomes associated with the upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and COVID-19 diseases has clinical interest. We hypothesized that the diversity of microbiome compositions and their genomic features are associated with different pathological conditions of these human respiratory tract diseases (COVID-19 and non-COVID; URTI and COPD). To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 21 whole metagenome sequences (WMS) including eleven COVID-19 (BD = 6 and China = 5), six COPD (UK = 6) and four URTI (USA = 4) samples to unravel the diversity of microbiomes, their genomic features and relevant metabolic functions. The WMS data mapped to 534 bacterial, 60 archaeal and 61 viral genomes with distinct variation in the microbiome composition across the samples (COVID-19>COPD>URTI). Notably, 94.57%, 80.0% and 24.59% bacterial, archaeal and viral genera shared between the COVID-19 and non-COVID samples, respectively, however, the COVID-19 related samples had sole association with 16 viral genera other than SARS-CoV-2. Strain-level virome profiling revealed 660 and 729 strains in COVID-19 and non-COVID sequence data, respectively and of them 34.50% strains shared between the conditions. Functional annotation of metagenomics sequences of thevCOVID-19 and non-COVID groups identified the association of several biochemical pathways related to basic metabolism (amino acid and energy), ABC transporters, membrane transport, replication and repair, clustering-based subsystems, virulence, disease and defense, adhesion, regulation of virulence, programmed cell death, and primary immunodeficiency. We also detected 30 functional gene groups/classes associated with resistance to antibiotics and toxic compounds (RATC) in both COVID-19 and non-COVID microbiomes. Furthermore, a predominant higher abundance of cobalt-zinc-cadmium resistance (CZCR) and multidrug resistance to efflux pumps (MREP) genes were detected in COVID-19 metagenome. The profiles of microbiome diversity and associated microbial genomic features found in both COVID-19 and non-COVID (COPD and URTI) samples might be helpful for developing the microbiome-based diagnostics and therapeutics for COVID-19 and non-COVID respiratory diseases. However, future studies might be carried out to explore the microbiome dynamics and the cross-talk between host and microbiomes employing larger volume of samples from different ethnic groups and geoclimatic conditions.",

Soluble decoy receptors, in which the ACE2 ectodomain is engineered to block S with high affinity, potently neutralize infection and, due to close similarity with the natural receptor, hold out the promise of being broadly active against virus variants without opportunity for escape. Here, we directly test this hypothesis. We find an engineered decoy receptor, sACE22.v2.4, tightly binds S of SARS-associated viruses from humans and bats, despite the ACE2-binding surface being a region of high diversity. Saturation mutagenesis of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) followed by in vitro selection, with wild type ACE2 and the engineered decoy competing for binding sites, failed to find S mutants that discriminate in favor of the wild type receptor. Variant N501Y in the RBD, which has emerged in a rapidly spreading lineage (B.1.1.7) in England, enhances affinity for wild type ACE2 20-fold but remains tightly bound to engineered sACE22.v2.4. We conclude that resistance to engineered decoys will be rare and that decoys may be active against future outbreaks of SARS-associated betacoronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Mosquito bites transmit a number of human pathogens resulting in potentially fatal diseases including malaria, dengue, chikungunya, West Nile encephalitis, and Zika. Although female mosquitoes transmit pathogens via salivary droplets deposited during blood feeding on a host, very little is known about the genomic content of these nanoliter scale droplets, including the transmission dynamics of live pathogens. Here we introduce Vectorchip, a low-cost, scalable microfluidic platform for molecular interrogation of individual mosquito bites in a high-throughput fashion. An ultra-thin PDMS membrane coupled to a microfluidic chip acts as a biting interface, through which freely-behaving mosquitoes deposit saliva droplets by biting into isolated arrayed micro-wells enabling molecular interrogation of individual bites. By modulating membrane thickness, the device enables on-chip comparison of biting capacity and provides a mechanical filter allowing selection of a specific mosquito species. Utilizing Vectorchip, we show on-chip simultaneous detection of mosquito DNA as well as viral RNA from Zika infected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes - demonstrating multiplexed high-throughput screening of vectors and pathogens. Focus-forming assays performed on-chip quantify number of infectious viral particles transmitted during mosquito bites, enabling assessment of active virus transmission. The platform presents a promising approach for single-bite-resolution laboratory and field characterization of vector pathogen communities, to reveal the intricate dynamics of pathogen transmission, and could serve as powerful early warning artificial \"sentinel\" for mosquito-borne diseases.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in synthetic biology is properly balancing evolved and engineered functions without compromising microbial fitness. Many microbial proteins are not required for growth in regular laboratory conditions, but it is unclear what fraction of the proteome can be eliminated to increase bioproduction and maintain fitness. Here, we investigated the effects of massive genome reduction in E. coli on the expression level and evolutionary stability of a model biosynthetic pathway to produce the pigment protodeoxyviolacein (PDV). We identified an amino acid metabolism imbalance and compromised growth that were correlated with elimination of genes associated with significant proteome fraction. Proteomic profiling suggested that increased amino acid pools are responsible for an alleviation of fitness defects associated with PDV expression. In addition, all strains with genome reductions that significantly affected the proteome exhibited decreased stability of PDV production compared to the wild-type strain under persistent PDV expression conditions despite the alleviation of fitness defects. These findings exhibit the importance of balancing evolved functions with engineered ones to achieve an optimal balance of fitness and bioproduction.",

    "abstract": "Sex is an important covariate of epigenome-wide association studies due to its strong influence on DNA methylation patterns across numerous genomic positions. Nevertheless, many samples on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) frequently lack a sex annotation or are incorrectly labelled. Considering the influence that sex imposes on DNA methylation patterns, it is necessary to ensure that methods for filtering poor samples and checking of sex assignment are accurate and widely applicable. In this paper, we presented a novel method to predict sex using only DNA methylation density signals, which can be readily applied to almost all DNA methylation datasets of different formats (raw IDATs or text files with only density signals) uploaded to GEO. We identified 4345 significantly (p < 0.01) sex-associated CpG sites present on both 450K and EPIC arrays, and constructed a sex classifier based on the two first components of PCAs from the two sex chromosomes. The proposed method is constructed using whole blood samples and exhibits good performance across a wide range of tissues. We further demonstrated that our method can be used to identify samples with sex chromosome aneuploidy, this function is validated by five Turner syndrome cases and one Klinefelter syndrome case. The proposed method has been integrated into the wateRmelon Bioconductor package.",

    "abstract": "G{circ}U(T) mismatch has the highest contribution to the error rate of base pair recognition in replication, as well as in codon-anticodon decoding in translation. Recently, this effect was unambiguously linked to keto-enol tautomerization, which enables the Watson-Crick (WC) geometry of the base pair. Structural studies of the ribosome revealing G{circ}U in the WC geometry in the closed state of the A-site challenge the canonical induced-fit model of decoding and currently lack a physicochemical explanation.\n\nUsing computational and theoretical methods, we address effects of the ribosomal A-site on the wobble{leftrightarrow}WC tautomerization reaction in G{circ}U (wb-WC reaction), and the consequent implications for the decoding mechanism in translation. The free energy change of the wb-WC reaction in the middle codon-anticodon position was calculated with quantum-mechanical/molecular-mechanical umbrella sampling simulations. The wb-WC reaction was endoergic in the open A-site, but exoergic in the closed state. This effect can be explained in part by the decreased polarity of the closed A-site.\n\nWe developed a model of initial selection in translation that incorporates the wb-WC reaction parameters in the open and closed states of the A-site. In the new model, the exoergic wb-WC reaction is kinetically restricted by the decoding rates, which explains the observations of the WC geometry at equilibrium conditions. Moreover, the model reveals constraints imposed by the exoergic wb-WC reaction on the decoding accuracy: its equilibration counteracts the favorable contribution from equilibration of the open-closed transition. The similarity of the base-pair recognition mechanism in DNA polymerases allows extending this model to replication as well. Our model can be a step towards a general recognition model for flexible substrates.",

    "abstract": "The tumor suppressor p53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer, and thus reactivation of mutated p53 is a promising avenue for cancer therapy. Analysis of wildtype p53 and the Y220C cancer mutant long-timescale molecular dynamics simulations with Markov state models and validation by NMR relaxation studies has uncovered the involvement of loop L6 in the slowest motions of the protein. Due to its distant location from the DNA-binding surface, the conformational dynamics of this loop has so far remained largely unexplored. We observe mutation-induced stabilization of alternate L6 conformations, distinct from all experimentally-determined structures, in which the loop is both extended and located further away from the DNA-interacting surface. Additionally, the effect of the L6-adjacent Y220C mutation on the conformational landscape of the functionally-important loop L1 suggests an allosteric role to this dynamic loop and the inactivation mechanism of the mutation. Finally, the simulations reveal a novel Y220C cryptic pocket that can be targeted for p53 rescue efforts. Our approach exemplifies the power of the MSM methodology for uncovering intrinsic dynamic and kinetic differences among distinct protein ensembles, such as for the investigation of mutation effects on protein function.",

    "abstract": "CXCR4 expression and downstream signaling have been identified as key factors in malignant hematopoiesis. Thus, up to 40% of all patients with Waldenstroms Macroglobulinemia (WM) carry an activating mutation of CXCR4 that leads to a more aggressive clinical course and inferior outcome upon treatment with the Brutons tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. Nevertheless, little is known about physiological mechanisms counteracting CXCR4 signaling in hematopoietic neoplasms. Recently, the endogenous human peptide EPI-X4 was identified as a natural CXCR4 antagonist that effectively blocks CXCL12-mediated receptor internalization and suppresses the migration and invasion of cancer cells towards a CXCL12 gradient. Here, we demonstrate that EPI-X4 efficiently impairs growth of WM cells in vitro and in vivo and blocks their migration towards CXCL12. The CXCR4 inhibitory activity of EPI-X4 is accompanied by decreased expression of genes involved in MAPK signaling and energy metabolism. Notably, the anti-WM activity of EPI-X4 could be further augmented by the rational design of EPI-X4 derivatives showing higher binding affinity to CXCR4. In summary, these data demonstrate that a naturally occurring anti-CXCR4 peptide is able to interfere with WM growth, and that optimized derivatives of EPI-X4 may represent a promising approach in suppressing growth promoting CXCR4 signaling in WM.",

    "abstract": "BackgroudMiRNA-223 has previously been reported to play an essential role in hepatic cholesterol homeostasis by suppressing cholesterol synthesis, attenuating cholesterol uptake by hepatocyte from and promoting cholesterol efflux into the blood. However, its role in regulation of biliary cholesterol secretion and gallstone formation remains unknown.\n\nMethodsMice with conventional knockout (KO), hepatocyte-specific knockout ({Delta}Hepa) / knockdown (KD) or gain expression of miRNA-223 were included in the study and were subjected to lithogenic diet (LD) for various weeks. The gallbladders were harvested and subjected to cholesterol crystal imaging and gallstone mass measurement. Liver tissues were collected for western blotting, RT-qPCR, and immunohistochemistry staining. Levels of cholesterol, bile salt, phospholipids, and triglyceride were determined in serum, liver tissues, and bile by enzyme color reactive assays. 3 UTR reporter gene assays were used to verify the direct target genes for miRNA-223.\n\nResultsLD-induced gallstone formation was remarkably accelerated in miRNA-223 KO, {Delta}Hepa, and KD mice with concurrent enhancement in total cholesterol levels in liver tissue and bile. Key biliary cholesterol transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 were identified as direct targets of miRNA-223. Reversely, AAV-mediated hepatocyte-specific miRNA-223 overexpression prevented gallstone progression with reduced targets protein expression.\n\nConclusionThe present study demonstrates a novel role of miRNA-223 in the regulation of hepatic bile cholesterol secretion pathway and gallstone formation by targeting ABCG5 and ABCG8 expression. Therefore, elevating miRNA-223 would be a potentially novel approach to overcome the sternness of cholesterol gallstone disease.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344580v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c418bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@134e20dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e4e0d2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@641b40_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The underlying signaling events triggered by exercise at different times of the day are, however, poorly understood. Here, we found that time-dependent variations in maximal treadmill exercise capacity of naive mice were associated with energy stores, mostly hepatic glycogen levels. Importantly, running at different times of the day resulted in a vastly different activation of signaling pathways, e.g., related to stress response, vesicular trafficking, repair, and regeneration. Second, voluntary wheel running at the opposite phase of the dark, feeding period surprisingly revealed minimal Zeitgeber (i.e., synchronizing) activity of training.

    "abstract": "O_LIEmbolism spreading in angiosperm xylem occurs via mesoporous pit membranes between vessels. Here, we investigate how the size of pore constrictions in pit membranes is related to pit membrane thickness and embolism resistance.\nC_LIO_LIIn three models, pit membranes are modelled as multiple layers to investigate how pit membrane thickness and the number of intervessel pits per vessel determine pore constriction sizes, the probability of encountering large pores, and air-seeding. These estimations were complemented by measurements of pit membrane thickness, embolism resistance, and number of intervessel pits per vessel (n = 31, 31, and 20 species, respectively).\nC_LIO_LIConstriction sizes in pores decreased with increasing pit membrane thickness, which agreed with the measured relationship between pit membrane thickness and embolism resistance. The number of pits per vessel affected constriction size and embolism resistance much less than pit membrane thickness. A strong relationship between estimated air-seeding pressures and measured embolism resistance was observed.\nC_LIO_LIPore constrictions provide a mechanistic explanation why pit membrane thickness determines embolism resistance, and suggest that hydraulic safety can be uncoupled from hydraulic efficiency. Although embolism spreading remains puzzling and encompasses more than pore constriction sizes, angiosperms are unlikely to have leaky pit membranes, which enables tensile transport of water.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Neuronal protein synthesis is essential for long-term memory consolidation. Conversely, dysregulation of protein synthesis has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimers disease (AD). Several types of cellular stress trigger the activation of protein kinases that converge on the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2-P). This leads to attenuation of cap-dependent mRNA translation, a component of the integrated stress response (ISR). We show that AD brains exhibit increased eIF2-P and reduced eIF2B, key components of the eIF2 translation initiation complex. We further demonstrate that attenuating the ISR with the small molecule compound ISRIB (ISR Inhibitor) rescues hippocampal protein synthesis and corrects impaired synaptic plasticity and memory in mouse models of AD. Our findings suggest that attenuating eIF2-P-mediated translational inhibition may comprise an effective approach to alleviate cognitive decline in AD.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral glucose hypometabolism is consistently observed in individuals with Alzheimers disease (AD), as well as in young cognitively normal carriers of the E4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (APOE), the strongest genetic predictor of late-onset AD. While this clinical feature has been described for over two decades, the mechanism underlying these changes in cerebral glucose metabolism remains a critical knowledge gap in the field. Here, we undertook a multi-omic approach by combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and stable isotope resolved metabolomics (SIRM) to define a metabolic rewiring across astrocytes, brain tissue, mice, and human subjects expressing APOE4. Single-cell analysis of brain tissue from mice expressing human APOE revealed E4-associated decreases in genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, particularly in astrocytes. This shift was confirmed on a metabolic level with isotopic tracing of 13C-glucose in E4 mice and astrocytes, which showed decreased pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle and increases in lactate synthesis. Metabolic phenotyping of E4 astrocytes showed elevated glycolytic activity, decreased oxygen consumption, blunted oxidative flexibility, and a lower rate of glucose oxidation in the presence of lactate. Together, these cellular findings suggested an E4 associated increase in aerobic glycolysis (i.e. the Warburg effect). To test whether this phenomenon translated to APOE4 humans, we analyzed the plasma metabolome of young and middle-aged human participants with and without the E4 allele, and used indirect calorimetry to measure whole body oxygen consumption and energy expenditure. In line with data from E4-expressing mice, young female E4 carriers showed a striking decrease in energy expenditure compared to non-carriers. This decrease in energy expenditure was primarily driven by a lower rate of oxygen consumption, and was exaggerated following a dietary glucose challenge. Further, the stunted oxygen consumption was accompanied by markedly increased lactate in the plasma of E4 carriers, and a pathway analysis of the plasma metabolome suggested an increase in aerobic glycolysis. Together, these results suggest astrocyte, brain and system-level metabolic reprogramming in the presence of APOE4, a  Warburg like endophenotype that is observable in young humans decades prior to clinically manifest AD.",

The most abundant RAN product, FMRpolyG, initiates predominantly at an ACG codon located just 5 to the repeat. Methods to accurately measure FMRpolyG in FXTAS patients are lacking. Here we used data dependent acquisition (DDA) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mass spectrometry coupled with stable isotope labeled standard peptides (SIS) to identify potential signature FMRpolyG fragments in patient cells and tissues. Following immunoprecipitation (IP) enrichment, we detected FMRpolyG signature peptides by PRM in transfected cells, FXTAS human samples and patient derived stem cells, but not in controls. Surprisingly, we identified two amino-terminal peptides: one beginning with methionine (Ac-MEAPLPGGVR) initiating at an ACG, and a second beginning with threonine (Ac-TEAPLPGGVR), initiating at a GUG. Abundance of the threonine peptide was enhanced relative to the methionine peptide upon activation of the integrated stress response. In addition, loss of the eIF2 alternative factor, eIF2A, or enhanced expression of initiation factor eIF1, preferentially suppressed GUG initiated FMRpolyG synthesis. These data demonstrate that FMRpolyG is quantifiable in human samples and that RAN translation on FMR1 initiates at specific near cognate codons dependent on available initiation factors and cellular environment.",

Using dual-indicator two-photon imaging of neurons and astrocytes during stimulations of hippocampal CA3 - CA1 Schaffer collateral (Scc) excitatory synapses, we report that under physiological conditions, the increased glutamate released from the higher frequency stimulation of neurons can accelerate local astrocytic Ca2+ levels. As consequences of extracellular glutamate clearance and maintaining of astrocytic intracellular Na+ homeostasis, the increase of astrocytic membrane Ca2+ permeability via Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) reverse mode is the primary reason of eliciting astrocytic intracellular Ca2+ elevation upon neuronal stimulation. This Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release is dependent on inositol triphosphate receptor type 2 (IP3R2).

    "abstract": "Type 2 inflammation is found in most forms of asthma, which may co-exist with recurrent viral infections, bacterial colonization, and host cell death. These processes drive the accumulation of intracellular cyclic-di-nucleotides such as cyclic-di-GMP (CDG). Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are critical drivers of type 2 lung inflammation during fungal allergen exposure in mice; however, it is unclear how CDG regulates lung ILC responses during lung inflammation. Here, we show that CDG induced early airway type 1 interferon (IFN) production and dramatically suppressed both lung proliferating CD127+ST2+ ILC2s and Alternaria- and IL-33-induced lung inflammation. Further, transcriptomic analysis of CD127-ST2- Thy1.2+ ILCs, which were expanded and activated by CDG, revealed an ILC1 signature. CDG administration led to accumulation of IFN{gamma}+ and T-bet+ ILC1s, as well as neutrophilia, independent of IL-18R, IL-12, and STAT6 but dependent on stimulator of interferon genes (STING) and partially dependent on type 1 IFN signaling. Thus, CDG potently suppresses ILC2-driven lung inflammation and promotes ILC1 responses. These results suggest potential therapeutic modulation of STING to suppress type 2 inflammation and/or increase anti-viral responses during respiratory infections.",

Epigenetic regulation plays important roles in many plant biological processes, but its potential impacts on the assembly of root microbiota remain unclear.

We compared two alleles of ibm1 mutant (ibm1-1 and ibm1-4) with wild type Arabidopsis regarding the root-associated bacteria community by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The constrained principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) showed that the ibm1 mutants are both clearly separated from Col-0 along the major coordinates. Among the 29 families which have a relative abundance more than 0.5% in at least one sample, 10 and 11 families were commonly affected by ibm1-1 and ibm1-4 alleles in the rhizosphere and the endosphere compartment, respectively. Notably, the ACMs (Abundant Community members) belonging Pseudomonadaceae showed increased relative abundance in the ibm1 mutant alleles compared to Col-0 in both the rhizosphere and the endosphere compartments. The ACMs belonging to Oxalobacteraceae mostly showed decreased relative abundance in ibm1 mutants compared to Col-0 in endosphere compartment.

    "abstract": "Nearly all bacteria are encased in a peptidoglycan cell wall, an essential crosslinked matrix of polysaccharide strands and short peptide stems. In the Gram-negative model organism Escherichia coli, more than forty cell wall synthases and autolysins coordinate the growth and division of the peptidoglycan sacculus in the periplasm. The precise contribution of many of these enzymes to cell wall metabolism remains unclear due to significant apparent redundancy, particularly among the cell wall autolysins. E. coli produces three major LytC-type-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidases, which share a role in separating the newly formed daughter cells during cytokinesis. Here, we reveal two of the three amidases exhibit growth medium-dependent changes in activity. Specifically, we report acidic growth conditions stimulate AmiB--and to a lesser extent, AmiC--activity. Combining computational and genetic analysis, we demonstrate that low pH-dependent stimulation of AmiB requires three periplasmic amidase activators: EnvC, NlpD, and YgeR. Altogether, our findings support overlapping, but not redundant, roles for the E. coli amidases in cell separation and illuminate the physiochemical environment as an important mediator of cell wall enzyme activity.\n\nIMPORTANCEPenicillin and related {beta}-lactam antibiotics targeting the bacterial cell wall synthesis are among the most commonly prescribed antimicrobials worldwide. However, rising rates of antibiotic resistance and tolerance jeopardize their continued clinical use. Development of new cell wall active therapeutics, including those targeting cell wall autolysins, has been stymied in part due to high levels of apparent enzymatic redundancy. In this study, we report a subset of E. coli amidases involved in cell separation during cell division are not redundant and instead are preferentially active during growth in distinct pH environments. Specifically, we discover E. coli amidases AmiB and AmiC are activated by acidic pH. Three semi-redundant periplasmic regulators--NlpD, EnvC, and YgeR--collectively mediate low pH-dependent stimulation of amidase activity. This discovery contributes to our understanding of how the cell wall remains robust across diverse environmental conditions and reveals opportunities for the development of condition-specific antimicrobial agents.",

    "abstract": "For viruses with segmented genomes, genetic diversity is generated by genetic drift, reassortment, and recombination. Recombination produces RNA populations distinct from full-length gene segments and can influence viral population dynamics, persistence, and host immune responses. Viruses in the Reoviridae family, including rotavirus and mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus), have been reported to package segments containing rearrangements or internal deletions. Rotaviruses with RNA segments containing rearrangements have been isolated from immunocompromised and immunocompetent children and in vitro following serial passage at high multiplicity. Reoviruses that package small, defective RNA segments have established chronic infections in cells and in mice. However, the mechanism and extent of Reoviridae RNA recombination are undefined. Towards filling this gap in knowledge, we determined the titers and RNA segment profiles for reovirus and rotavirus following serial passage in cultured cells. The viruses exhibited occasional titer reductions characteristic of interference. Reovirus strains frequently accumulated segments that retained 5' and 3' terminal sequences and featured large internal deletions, while similar segments were rarely detected in rotavirus populations. Using next-generation RNA-sequencing to analyze RNA molecules packaged in purified reovirus particles, we identified distinct recombination sites within individual viral gene segments. Recombination junction sites were frequently associated with short regions of identical sequence. Taken together, these findings suggest that reovirus accumulates defective gene segments featuring internal deletions during passage and undergoes sequence-directed recombination at distinct sites.\n\nIMPORTANCEViruses in the Reoviridae family include important pathogens of humans and other animals and have segmented RNA genomes. Recombination in RNA virus populations can facilitate novel host exploration and increased disease severity. The extent, patterns, and mechanisms of Reoviridae recombination and the functions and effects of recombined RNA products are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that mammalian orthoreovirus regularly synthesizes RNA recombination products that retain terminal sequences but contain internal deletions, while rotavirus rarely synthesizes such products. Recombination occurs more frequently at specific sites in the mammalian orthoreovirus genome, and short regions of identical sequence are often detected at junction sites. These findings suggest that mammalian orthoreovirus recombination events are directed in part by RNA sequences. An improved understanding of recombined viral RNA synthesis may enhance our capacity to engineer improved vaccines and virotherapies in the future.",

Here, we introduce a technique for genetic minimization by iterative size-exclusion and recombination (MISER) that comprehensively assays all possible deletions of a protein. Using MISER, we generated a deletion landscape for the CRISPR protein Cas9. We found that Cas9 can tolerate large single deletions to the REC2, REC3, HNH, and RuvC domains, while still functioning in vitro and in vivo, and that these deletions can be stacked together to engineer minimal, DNA-binding effector proteins. In total, our results demonstrate that extant proteins retain significant modularity from the accretion process and, as genetic size is a major limitation for viral delivery systems, establish a general technique to improve genome editing and gene therapy-based therapeutics.",

Upon application of our approach using 3,244 biological concepts, we detected genomic variation in 68 biological concepts with significant association to autism in comparison to family-based controls. These concepts clustered naturally into a total of 19 classes, principally including cell adhesion, cancer, and immune response. The top-ranking concepts contained high percentages of genes already suspected to play roles in autism or in a related neurological disorder. In addition, many of the sets associated with autism at the DNA level also proved to be predictive of changes in gene expression within a separate population of autistic cases, suggesting that the signature of genomic variation may also be detectable in blood-based transcriptional profiles. This robust cross-validation with gene expression data from individuals with autism coupled with the enrichment within autism-related neurological disorders supported the possibility that the mutations play important roles in the onset of autism and should be given priority for further study. In sum, our work provides new leads into the genetic underpinnings of autism and highlights the importance of reanalysis of genomic studies of complex disease using prior knowledge of genetic organization.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe genetic heterogeneity of autism has stymied the search for causes and cures. Even whole-genomic studies on large numbers of families have yielded results of relatively little impact. In the present work, we reanalyze two of the most influential whole-genomic studies using a novel strategy that takes prior knowledge of genetic relationships into account in an effort to boost signal important to our understanding of the molecular structure of autism. Our approach demonstrates that these genome wide association studies contain more information relevant to autism than previously realized. We detected 68 highly significant collections of mutations that map to genes with measurable and significant changes in gene expression in autistic individuals, and that have been implicated in other neurological disorders believed to be closely related, and genetically linked, to autism. Our work provides leads into the genetic underpinnings of autism and highlights the importance of reanalysis of genomic studies of disease using prior knowledge of genetic organization.",

    "abstract": "Increases in soil salinity impacts growth and yield of agricultural plants by inhibiting plant functions. Soil salinization is increasing because of the pressure of a growing population on food supply. Genetically modified crops and plant breeding techniques are being used to produce plants tolerant to salt stress. However, interactions of fungal endophytes with crop plants can also improve tolerance and is a less expensive approach. Here, the role of Trichoderma harzianum T-22 in alleviating NaCl-induced stress in two barley genotypes (cv. Vlamingh and cv. Gairdner) has been investigated. Metabolomics using GC-MS for polar metabolites and LC-MS for lipids was employed to provide insights into the biochemical changes in barley roots inoculated with fungus during the early stages of interaction. T. harzianum increased the root length of both genotypes under controlled and saline conditions. The fungus reduced the relative concentration of sugars in both genotypes and caused no change in organic acids under saline conditions. Amino acids decreased only in cv. Gairdner in fungus-inoculated roots under saline conditions. Lipid analyses suggest that salt stress causes large changes in the lipid profile of roots but that inoculation with fungus greatly reduces the extent of these changes. By studying a tolerant and a sensitive genotype and their responses to salt and inoculation we have been able to develop hypotheses about what lipid species and metabolites may be involved in the tolerant genotype for its tolerance to salt and how fungal inoculation changes the response of the sensitive genotype to improve its tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Maize, Zea mays L., is the most abundant field crop in China. Aphids are the most economically damaging pest on maize, particularly in the cotton agri-ecosystems of Jilin Province, northern China. Parasitic wasps are important natural enemies of aphids, but limited information exists about their species composition, richness and seasonal dynamics in northern China. In this study, the population dynamics of maize aphids and parasitoid wasps were assessed in relation to each other during the summer seasons of two consecutive years, 2018 and 2019. We selected maize fields in the Changchun, Songyuan, Huinan and Gongzhuling areas of Jilin Province. Four species of aphids were recorded from these maize fields: Rhopalosiphum padi (L), Rhopalosiphum maidis (Fitch), Aphis gossypii Glover and Macrosiphum miscanthi (Takahashi). The dominant species in each of the four areas were R. maids (Filch) and R. padi in Changchun, R. padi in Songyuan, A. gossypii and R. padi in Huinan, and A.gossypii and R. padi in Gongzhuling. We delineated a species complex made up of primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids associated with maize aphids. The primary parasitoids Lysiphlebus testaceipes, Binodoxys communis and Aphelinus albipodus together formed approximately 85.3% of the parasitoid complex. Pachyneuron aphidis, Phaenoglyphis villosa, Syrphophagus taeniatus and Asaphes suspensus made up the hyperparasitoids. Of the primary parasitoids, L. testaceipes was the dominant species (81.31%). Of the hyperparasitoid group, P. villosa was the dominant species (68.42%). Parasitism rates followed the fluctuation of the aphid population. The highest parasitic rate was observed during the peak period of cotton aphids. In this paper, the occurrence dynamics and dominant species of aphids and the dynamics of parasitic natural enemies of aphids in maize fields in Jilin Province are, for the first time, systematically reported. This study provides important information for the establishment and promotion of aphid biological control in maize fields.",

    "abstract": "Host-associated microbiomes can play important roles in the ecology and evolution of their insect hosts, but bacterial diversity in many insect groups remains poorly understood. Here we examine the relationship between host environment, host traits, and microbial diversity in three species in the ground beetle family (Coleoptera: Carabidae), a group of roughly 40,000 species that synthesize a wide diversity of defensive compounds. This study found that the ground beetle microbiome is consistent across different host food sources. We used 16S amplicon sequencing to profile three species that are phylogenetically distantly related, trophically distinct, and whose defensive chemical secretions differ: Anisodactylus similis LeConte, 1851, Pterostichus serripes (LeConte, 1875), and Brachinus elongatulus Chaudoir, 1876. Wild-caught beetles were compared to individuals maintained in the lab for two weeks on carnivorous, herbivorous, or starvation diets. Soil environment but not diet had a significant effect on bacterial diversity and composition. The three carabid species have patterns of microbial diversity similar to those previously found in other insect hosts. Metagenomic samples from two highly active tissue types -- guts, and pygidial gland secretory cells (which produce defensive compounds) -- were processed and sequenced separately from those of the remaining body. The observed similarity of the pygidial gland secretory cell microbiome across hosts suggests the possibility that it may be a conserved community, possibly due to functional interactions related to defensive chemistry. These results provide a baseline for future studies of the role of microbes in the diversification of defensive chemical biosynthesis in carabids.",

In particular, the use of G0 mosaic mutants has potential to increase throughput of functional studies significantly but may suffer from transient effects of introducing Cas9 via microinjection. Further, a large number of computational and empirical tools exist to design CRISPR assays but often produce varied predictions across methods leaving uncertainty in choosing an optimal approach for zebrafish studies.\n\nMethodsTo systematically assess accuracy of tool predictions of on- and off-target gene editing, we subjected zebrafish embryos to CRISPR/Cas9 with 50 different guide RNAs (gRNAs) targeting 14 genes. We also investigate potential confounders of G0-based CRISPR screens by screening control embryos for spurious mutations and altered gene expression.\n\nResultsWe compared our experimental in vivo editing efficiencies in mosaic G0 embryos with those predicted by eight commonly used gRNA design tools and found large discrepancies between methods. Assessing off-target mutations (predicted in silico and in vitro) found that the majority of tested loci had low in vivo frequencies (<1%). To characterize if commonly used  mock CRISPR controls (larvae injected with Cas9 enzyme or mRNA with no gRNA) exhibited spurious molecular features that might exacerbate studies of G0 mosaic CRISPR knockout fish, we generated an RNA-seq dataset of various control larvae at 5 days post fertilization. While we found no evidence of spontaneous somatic mutations of injected larvae, we did identify several hundred differentially-expressed genes with high variability between injection types. Network analyses of shared differentially-expressed genes in the  mock injected larvae implicated a number of key regulators of common metabolic pathways, and gene-ontology analysis revealed connections with response to wounding and cytoskeleton organization, highlighting a potentially lasting effect from the microinjection process that requires further investigation.\n\nConclusionOverall, our results provide a valuable resource for the zebrafish community for the design and execution of CRISPR/Cas9 experiments.",

    "abstract": "Horses have the ability to generate a remarkable repertoire of facial expressions, some which have been linked to certain emotional states, for example pain. Studies suggest that facial expressions may be a more  honest expression of emotional state in horses than behavioral or physiological parameters. This study sought to describe the facial expressions during stress of healthy horses free of pain, using a standardized method of recording facial expressions in video. Stress was induced in 28 horses by subjecting them to road transport and 10 of these horses were also subjected to social isolation. The horses served as their own control. A body-mounted, remote controlled heart rate monitor provided continuous heart rate measurements during the interventions. The horses facial expressions were video-recorded during the interventions. Frequency and duration of each facial expression were then determined, according to the Equine Facial Action Coding System. Heart rate increased during the stressful interventions (p=0.01), confirming that the interventions were stressful. Using both the human investigation- and the co-occurrence methods, the following facial traits could be observed during stress: eye white increase (p<0.001), nostril dilator (p<0.001), upper eyelid raiser (p<0.001), inner brow raiser (p=0.042), tongue show (p<0.001) along with an increase in  ear flicker (p<0.001) and blink frequency (p<0.001). The facial actions were successfully used to train a machine-learning classifier to discriminate between stressed and calm horses, with an accuracy of 74.2 %. Most of the facial features identified correspond well with previous research on the subject, for example flared nostrils, repetitive mouth behaviors, increased eye white, tongue show and ear movements. Some features selected as indicative of emotional pain-free stress are used in face-based pain assessment tools, such as dilated nostrils, eye white increase or inner brow raiser. The relation between facial expressions of stress and pain should therefore further be studied.",

However, existing methods rely on empirical segmentation thresholds, thus can have insufficient accuracy of extracted phenotypes. Taking maize as an example crop, we propose a phenotype extraction approach from top-view images at the seedling stage. An end-to-end segmentation network, named PlantU-net, which uses a small amount of training data, was explored to realize automatic segmentation of top-view images of a maize population at the seedling stage. Morphological and color related phenotypes were automatic extracted, including maize shoot coverage, circumscribed radius, aspect ratio, and plant azimuth plane angle. The results show that the approach can segment the shoots at the seedling stage from top-view images, obtained either from the UAV or ground high-throughput phenotyping platform. The average segmentation accuracy, recall rate, and F1 score are 0.96, 0.98, and 0.97, respectively. The extracted phenotypes, including maize shoot coverage, circumscribed radius, aspect ratio, and plant azimuth plane angle, are highly correlated with manual measurements (R2=0.96-0.99). This approach requires less training data and thus has better expansibility. It provides practical means for high-throughput phenotyping analysis of early growth stage crop populations.",

    "abstract": "Information experiences complex transformation processes in the brain, involving various errors. A daunting and critical challenge in neuroscience is to understand the origin of these errors and their effects on neural information processing. While previous efforts have made substantial progresses in studying the information errors in bounded, unreliable and noisy transformation cases, it still remains elusive whether the neural system is inherently error-free under an ideal and noise-free condition. This work brings the controversy to an end with a negative answer. We propose a novel neural information confusion theory, indicating the widespread presence of information confusion phenomenon after the end of transmission process, which originates from innate neuron characteristics rather than external noises. Then, we reformulate the definition of zero-error capacity under the context of neuroscience, presenting an optimal upper bound of the zero-error transformation rates determined by the tuning properties of neurons. By applying this theory to neural coding analysis, we unveil the multi-dimensional impacts of information confusion on neural coding. Although it reduces the variability of neural responses and limits mutual information, it controls the stimulus-irrelevant neural activities and improves the interpretability of neural responses based on stimuli. Together, the present study discovers an inherent and ubiquitous precision limitation of neural information transformation, which shapes the coding process by neural ensembles. These discoveries reveal that the neural system is intrinsically error-prone in information processing even in the most ideal cases.\n\nAuthor summaryOne of the most central challenges in neuroscience is to understand the information processing capacity of the neural system. Decades of efforts have identified various errors in nonideal neural information processing cases, indicating that the neural system is not optimal in information processing because of the widespread presences of external noises and limitations. These incredible progresses, however, can not address the problem about whether the neural system is essentially error-free and optimal under ideal information processing conditions, leading to extensive controversies in neuroscience. Our work brings this well-known controversy to an end with a negative answer. We demonstrate that the neural system is intrinsically error-prone in information processing even in the most ideal cases, challenging the conventional ideas about the superior neural information processing capacity. We further indicate that the neural coding process is shaped by this innate limit, revealing how the characteristics of neural information functions and further cognitive functions are determined by the inherent limitation of the neural system.",

    "abstract": "The ability for cells to internalize extracellular cues allows them to adapt to novel and stressful environments. This adaptability is especially important for microbial pathogens that must sense and respond to drastic changes when encountering the human host. Cryptococcus neoformans is an environmental fungus and opportunistic pathogen that naturally lives in slightly acidic reservoirs, but must adapt to the relative increase in alkalinity in the human host in order to effectively cause disease. The fungal-specific Rim alkaline response signaling pathway effectively converts this extracellular signal into an adaptive cellular response allowing the pathogen to survive in its new environment. The newly identified Rra1 protein, the most upstream component of the C. neoformans Rim pathway, is an essential component of this alkaline response. Previous work connected Rra1-mediated signaling to the dynamics of the plasma membrane. Here we identify the specific mechanisms of Rim pathway signaling through detailed studies of the activation of the Rra1 protein. Specifically, we observe that the Rra1 protein is internalized and recycled in a pH-dependent manner, and that this dynamic pattern of localization further depends on specific residues in its C-terminal tail, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and the integrity of the plasma membrane. The data presented here continue to unravel the complex and intricate processes of pH-sensing in a relevant human fungal pathogen. These studies will further elucidate general mechanisms by which cells respond to and internalize extracellular stress signals.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe work described here explores the genetics and mechanics of a cellular signaling pathway in a relevant human fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans. The findings presented in this manuscript untangle the complex interactions involved in the activation of a fungal-specific alkaline response pathway, the Rim pathway. Specifically, we find that C. neoformans is able to sense an increase in pH within the human host, internalize a membrane-bound pH-sensor, and activate a downstream signaling pathway enabling this pathogen to adapt to a novel host environment and effectively cause disease. Revealing the mechanisms of Rim pathway activation within the larger context of the fungal cell allows us to understand how and when this microorganism interprets relevant host signals. Furthermore, understanding how this pathogenic organism converts extracellular stress signals into an adaptive cellular response will elucidate more general mechanisms of microbial environmental sensing and stress response.",

Results showed that O. foetida significantly affected the biomass, grain yield, chlorophyll content index (CCI) and the maximum quantum efficiency (Fv/Fm ratio). No significant effect of O. foetida parasitism was observed on host plant water content (WC). O. foetida parasitism significantly affected both CCI and Fv/Fm ratio.

    "abstract": "The current study aimed to investigate the damage of long-term high concentrate diet feeding pattern on Yak jejunal structure, physiological function and protein composition during cold season. Twelve Datong male Yak (Bos grunniens) with the same age from cold season were randomly selected and slaughtered to determine Yak jejunal digestive enzyme activity, morphology and protein composition on different feeding patterns in Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that Yak jejunum digestive enzyme activity and morphology of grazing reared group were better than those in the intensively reared group. A total of 96 differentially expressed proteins were identified by label-free Mass Spectrometry (MS), which could be concluded to two predominant themes: protein structure and inflammatory response. Nine differentially expressed proteins were correlated in Yak jejunum damage in different feeding patterns. According to our study, feeding patterns resulted in the differences in Yak jejunum physiological function, morphology and protein composition. Our results confirmed that feeding of long-term high concentrate diet could damage the jejunum epithelial morphology and function.",

    "abstract": "Identifying plant species requires considerable knowledge and can be difficult without complete specimens. Fourier-transform near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) is an effective technique for discriminating plant species, especially angiosperms. However, its efficacy has never been tested on ferns. Here we tested the accuracy of FT-NIR at discriminating species of the genus Microgramma. We obtained 16 spectral readings per individual from the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of 100 specimens belonging to 13 species. The analyses included all 1557 spectral variables. We tested different datasets (adaxial+abaxial, adaxial, and abaxial) to compare the correct identification of species through the construction of discriminant models (LDA, PLS) and cross-validation techniques (leave-one-out, K-fold). All analyses recovered an overall high percentage (>90 %) of correct predictions of specimen identifications for all datasets, regardless of the model or cross-validation used. On average, there was > 95 % accuracy when using PLS-DA and both cross-validations. Our results show the high predictive power of FT-NIR at correctly discriminating fern species when using leaves of dried herbarium specimens. The technique is sensitive enough to reflect species delimitation problems and possible hybridization, and it has the potential of helping better delimit and identify fern species.",

    "abstract": "The B3 superfamily is a plant-specific family, which involves in growth and development process. By now, the identification of B3 superfamily in pineapple (Ananas comosus) has not reported. In this study, 57 B3 genes were identified and further phylogenetically classified into five subfamilies, all genes contained B3 domain. Chromosomal localization analysis revealed that 54 of 57 AcB3 genes were located on 21 chromosomes.Collinearity analysis indicated that the segmental duplication was the main event in the evolution of B3 gene superfamily and most of them were under purifying selection. Moreover, there were 7 and 39 pairs of orthologous B3s were identified between pineapple and Arabidopsis or rice, respectively, which indicated the closer genetic relationship between pineapple and rice. Most genes had cis-element of abscisic acid, ethylene, MeJA, light, and abiotic stress. qRT-PCR showed that the expression level of most AcB3 genes were up-regulated within 1 d after ethephon treatment and expressed high level in flower bud differentiation period in stem apex. This study provide a comprehensive understanding of AcB3s and a basis for future molecular studies of ethephon induced pineapple flowering.",
