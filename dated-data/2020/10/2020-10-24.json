    "abstract": "O_LIMost organisms must regulate their nutritional intake in an environment full of complex food choices. While this process is well understood for self-sufficient organisms, dependent offspring, such as bee larvae, in practice have limited food choices because food is provided by parents. Nutrient balancing may therefore be achieved by offspring, by parents on offsprings behalf, or by both, whether cooperatively or in conflict.\nC_LIO_LIWe used the Geometric Framework to investigate the capacity of dependent larval mason bees (Osmia bicornis) to regulate their intake of protein and carbohydrate. Female Osmia seal eggs individually inside cells they have provisioned with pollen, and have no contact with developing offspring, allowing offspring choices to be studied in isolation. Herbivorous insect larvae are typically expected to balance protein and carbohydrate to maximise growth and reproduction.\nC_LIO_LIContrary to prediction, carbohydrate and not protein mediated both growth and survival to pupation. Accordingly, larvae prioritised maintaining a constant intake of carbohydrate and self-selected a relatively carbohydrate biased diet compared to other hymenopterans, while tolerating wide excesses and deficiencies of protein, rendering them potentially vulnerable to dietary change or manipulation. Reasons for prioritising carbohydrate may include (1) the relative abundance of protein in their normal pollen diet, (2) the relative paucity of nectar in parental provisions making carbohydrate a scarce resource, or (3) the requirement for diapause for all O. bicornis larvae. Larvae were intolerant of moderate dietary dilution, likely reflecting an evolutionary history of nutrient-dense food.\nC_LIO_LIOur results demonstrate that dependent offspring can remain active participants in balancing their own nutrients even when sedentary, and, moreover, even in mass provisioning systems where parents and offspring have no physical contact. Research should now focus on whether and how evolutionary interests of parent and dependent offspring coincide or conflict with respect to food composition, and the implications for species resilience to changing environments.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Individual animals vary in their behaviors. This is true even when they share the same genotype and were reared in the same environment. Clusters of covarying behaviors constitute behavioral syndromes, and an individuals position along such axes of covariation is a representation of their personality. Despite these conceptual frameworks, the structure of behavioral covariation within a genotype is essentially uncharacterized and its mechanistic origins unknown. Passing hundreds of inbred Drosophila individuals through an experimental pipeline that captured hundreds of behavioral measures, we found correlations only between sparse pairs of behaviors. Thus, the space of behavioral variation has many independent dimensions. Manipulating the physiology of the brain, and specific neural populations, altered specific correlations. We also observed that variation in gene expression can predict an individuals position on some behavior axes. This work represents the first steps in understanding the biological mechanisms determining the structure of behavioral variation within a genotype.",

    "abstract": "Pathology differentiation of renal cancer types is challenging due to tissue similarities or overlapping histological features of various tumor (sub)types. As assessment is often manually conducted outcomes can be prone to human error and therefore require high-level expertise and experience. Mass spectrometry can provide detailed histo-molecular information on tissue and is becoming increasingly popular in clinical settings. Spatially resolving technologies such as mass spectrometry imaging and quantitative microproteomics profiling in combination with machine learning approaches provide promising tools for automated tumor classification of clinical tissue sections.\n\nIn this proof of concept study we used MALDI-MS imaging (MSI) and rapid LC-MS/MS-based microproteomics technologies (15 min/sample) to analyze formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue sections and classify renal oncocytoma (RO, n=11), clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC, n=12) and chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC, n=5). Both methods were able to distinguish ccRCC, RO and ChRCC in cross-validation experiments. MSI correctly classified 87% of the patients whereas the rapid LC-MS/MS-based microproteomics approach correctly classified 100% of the patients.\n\nThis strategy involving MSI and rapid proteome profiling by LC-MS/MS reveals molecular features of tumor sections and enables cancer subtype classification. Mass spectrometry provides a promising complementary approach to current pathological technologies for precise digitized diagnosis of diseases.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of the host component of sepsis has made significant progress. However, detailed study of the microorganisms causing sepsis, either as single pathogens or microbial assemblages, has received far less attention. Metagenomic data offer opportunities to characterise the microbial communities found in septic and healthy individuals. In this study we apply gradient-boosted tree classifiers and a novel computational decontamination technique built upon SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify microbial hallmarks which discriminate blood metagenomic samples of septic patients from that of healthy individuals. Classifiers had high performance when using the read assignments to microbial genera (AUROC = 0.995), including after removal of species  confirmed as the cause of sepsis through clinical testing (AUROC = 0.915). Models trained on single genera were inferior to those employing a polymicrobial model and we identified multiple co-occurring bacterial genera absent from healthy controls.\n\nImportanceWhile prevailing diagnostic paradigms seek to identify single pathogens, our results point to the involvement of a polymicrobial community in sepsis. We demonstrate the importance of the microbial component in characterising sepsis, which may offer new biological insights into the aetiology of sepsis and allow the development of clinical diagnostic or even prognostic tools.",

We performed in vivo shRNA screening to identify targets generally associated with radiation response as well as those exhibiting a genomic dependency. This identified the histone acetyltransferases CREBBP/EP300 as a target for radiosensitization in combination with radiation in cognate mutant tumors. Further in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed this phenomenon was due to repression of homologous recombination following DNA damage and can be reproduced using chemical inhibition of histone acetyltransferase (HAT), but not bromodomain function. Selected mutations in CREBBP lead to a hyperacetylated state that increases CBP and BRCA1 acetylation, representing a gain of function targets by HAT inhibition. Additionally, mutations in CREBBP/EP300 were associated with recurrence following radiation, in several squamous cell carcinoma cohorts. These findings represent both a novel mechanism of treatment resistance and the potential for genomically-driven treatment.",

In this work, we present Bacterial Cell Morphometry 3D (BCM3D), an image analysis workflow that combines deep learning with mathematical image analysis to accurately segment and classify single bacterial cells in 3D fluorescence images. In BCM3D, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained using simulated biofilm images with experimentally realistic SBRs, cell densities, labeling methods, and cell shapes.

Unfortunately, an effective vaccine or therapeutic is not currently available, resulting in tens of thousands of hospitalizations per year. In an effort to discover a protective antibody against HPIV3, we screened the B cell repertoires from peripheral blood, tonsils, or spleen from healthy children and adults. These analyses yielded five monoclonal antibodies that potently neutralized HPIV3 in vitro. These HPIV3 neutralizing antibodies targeted two non-overlapping epitopes of the HPIV3 F protein, with most targeting the apex. Importantly, prophylactic administration of one of these antibodies, named PI3-E12, resulted in potent protection against HPIV3 infection in cotton rats. Additionally, PI3-E12 could also be used therapeutically to suppress HPIV3 in immunocompromised animals. These results demonstrate the potential clinical utility of PI3-E12 for the prevention or treatment of HPIV3 in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite marked recent improvements in long-read sequencing technology, the assembly of diploid genomes remains a difficult task. A major obstacle is distinguishing between alternative contigs that represent highly heterozygous regions. If primary and secondary contigs are not properly identified, the primary assembly will overrepresent both the size and complexity of the genome, which complicates downstream analysis such as scaffolding.\n\nResultsHere we illustrate a new method, which we call HapSolo, that identifies secondary contigs and defines a primary assembly based on multiple pairwise contig alignment metrics. HapSolo evaluates candidate primary assemblies using BUSCO scores and then distinguishes among candidate assemblies using a cost function. The cost function can be defined by the user but by default considers the number of missing, duplicated and single BUSCO genes within the assembly. HapSolo performs hill climbing to minimize cost over thousands of candidate assemblies. We illustrate the performance of HapSolo on genome data from three species: the Chardonnay grape (Vitis vinifera), with a genome of 490Mb, a mosquito (Anopheles funestus; 200Mb) and the Thorny Skate (Amblyraja radiata; 2,650 Mb).\n\nConclusionsHapSolo rapidly identified candidate assemblies that yield improvements in assembly metrics, including decreased genome size and improved N50 scores. Contig N50 scores improved by 35%, 9% and 9% for Chardonnay, mosquito and the thorny skate, respectively, relative to unreduced primary assemblies. The benefits of HapSolo were amplified by down-stream analyses, which we illustrated by scaffolding with Hi-C data. We found, for example, that prior to the application of HapSolo, only 52% of the Chardonnay genome was captured in the largest 19 scaffolds, corresponding to the number of chromosomes. After the application of HapSolo, this value increased to ~84%. The improvements for mosquito scaffolding were similar to that of Chardonnay (from 61% to 86%), but even more pronounced for thorny skate. We compared the scaffolding results to assemblies that were based on another published method for identifying secondary contigs, with generally superior results for HapSolo.",

    "abstract": "Driver genes with a mutually exclusive mutation pattern across tumor genomes are thought to have overlapping roles in tumorigenesis. In contrast, we show here that mutually-exclusive prostate cancer driver alterations involving the ERG transcription factor and the ubiquitin ligase adaptor SPOP are synthetic sick. At the molecular level, the incompatible cancer pathways are driven by opposing functions in SPOP. ERG up-regulates wild type SPOP to dampen androgen receptor (AR) signaling and sustain ERG activity through degradation of the bromodomain histone reader ZMYND11. Conversely, SPOP-mutant tumors stabilize ZMYND11 to repress ERG-function and enable oncogenic androgen receptor signaling. This dichotomy regulates the response to therapeutic interventions in the AR pathway. While mutant SPOP renders tumor cells susceptible to androgen deprivation therapies, ERG promotes sensitivity to high-dose androgen therapy and pharmacological inhibition of wild type SPOP. More generally, these results define a distinct class of antagonistic cancer drivers and a blueprint toward their therapeutic exploitation.",

    "abstract": "In recent years there has been growing evidence regarding the effect of microbiota on the skeletal growth and homeostasis. Here we present, for the first time, accelerated longitudinal and radial bone growth in young (7-week-old) germ-free male rats after short-term exposure to a newly established gut microbiota. Changes in bone mass and structure were analyzed after 10 days following the onset of colonization through cohousing with conventional rats and revealed unprecedented acceleration of bone accrual in cortical and trabecular compartments, increased bone tissue mineral density, improved proliferation and hypertrophy of growth plate chondrocytes, bone lengthening, and preferential deposition of periosteal bone in tibia diaphysis. In addition, the number of small-in-size adipocytes increased, while the number of megakaryocytes decreased, in the bone marrow of conventionalized germ-free rats. The observed changes in bone status were paralleled with a positive shift in microbiota composition towards short chain fatty acids (SCFA)-producing microbes, which reflected a dramatic increase in cecal concentration of SCFA, specifically butyrate. Further, reconstitution of the host holobiont increased hepatic expression of IGF-1 and its circulating levels, implicating an involvement of the somatotropic axis. Increased serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D and alkaline phosphatase pointed toward an active process of bone formation. The acute stimulatory effect on bone growth occurred independently of body mass increase and resembled reversal of dysbiosis in adolescence, which is marked by rapid skeletal expansion. These findings may help in developing microbiota-based therapeutics to combat bone related disorders resulting from hormonal defects and/or malnutrition in children and adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Embryonic development in mammals is highly sensitive to changes in gene expression within the placenta. The placenta is also highly enriched for genes showing parent-of-origin or imprinted expression, which is predicted to evolve rapidly in response to parental conflict. However, little is known about the evolution of placental gene expression, or if divergence of placental gene expression plays an important role in mammalian speciation. We used crosses between two species of dwarf hamsters (Phodopus sungorus and P. campbelli) to examine the genetic and regulatory underpinnings of severe placental overgrowth in their hybrids. Using quantitative genetic mapping and mitochondrial substitution lines, we show that overgrowth of hybrid placentas was primarily caused by genetic differences on the maternally inherited P. sungorus X chromosome. Mitochondrial interactions did not contribute to abnormal hybrid placental development, and there was only weak correspondence between placental disruption and embryonic growth. Genome-wide analyses of placental transcriptomes from the parental species and first and second-generation hybrids revealed a central group of co-expressed X-linked and autosomal genes that were highly enriched for maternally-biased expression. Expression of this gene network was strongly correlated with placental size and showed widespread misexpression dependent on epistatic interactions with X-linked hybrid incompatibilities. Collectively, our results indicate that the X chromosome is likely to play a prominent role in the evolution of placental gene expression and the accumulation of hybrid developmental barriers between mammalian species.",

    "abstract": "Boron toxicity is a worldwide problem for crop production, yet we have only a limited understanding of the genetic responses and adaptive mechanisms to this environmental stress in plants. Here we identified responses to excess boron in boron stress-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana and its boron stress-tolerant extremophyte relative Schrenkiella parvula using comparative genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and ionomics. S. parvula maintains a lower level of total boron and free boric acid in its roots and shoots and sustains growth for longer durations than A. thaliana when grown with excess boron. S. parvula likely excludes boron more efficiently than A. thaliana, which we propose is partly driven by BOR5, a boron transporter that we functionally characterized in the current study. Both species allocate significant transcriptomic and metabolomic resources to enable their cell walls to serve as a partial sink for excess boron, particularly discernable in A. thaliana shoots. We provide evidence that the S. parvula transcriptome is pre-adapted to boron toxicity, exhibiting substantial overlap with the boron-stressed transcriptome of A. thaliana. Our transcriptomic and metabolomics data also suggest that RNA metabolism is a primary target of boron toxicity. Cytoplasmic boric acid likely forms complexes with ribose and ribose-containing compounds critical to RNA and other primary metabolic functions. A model depicting some of the cellular responses that enable a plant to grow in the presence of normally toxic levels of boron is presented.",

    "abstract": "Macromolecular transport across the nuclear envelope depends on facilitated diffusion through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The interior of NPCs contains a permeability barrier made of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domains that selectively facilitates the permeation of cargoes bound to nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). FG repeats in NPC are a major site of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification, but the functional role of this modification in nucleocytoplasmic transport is unclear. We developed high-throughput assays based on optogenetic probes to quantify the kinetics of nuclear import and export in living human cells. We found that increasing O-GlcNAc modification of the NPC accelerated NTR-facilitated nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins in both directions, and decreasing modification slowed transport. Super-resolution imaging revealed strong enrichment of O-GlcNAc at the FG-repeat barrier. O-GlcNAc modification also accelerated passive permeation of a small, inert protein through NPCs. We conclude that O-GlcNAc modification accelerates nucleocytoplasmic transport by enhancing the non-specific permeability the FG-repeat barrier, perhaps by steric inhibition of interactions between FG repeats.\n\nSummaryNuclear pore complexes mediate nuclear transport and are highly modified with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on FG repeat domains. Using a new quantitative live-cell imaging assay, Yoo and Mitchison demonstrate acceleration of nuclear import and export by O-GlcNAc modification.",

Visual responses of a subset of pyramidal cells are included. The data are being made publicly available, along with tools for programmatic and 3D interactive access. The density of synaptic inputs onto inhibitory neurons varies across cell classes and compartments. We uncover a compartment-specific correlation between mitochondrial coverage and synapse density. Frequencies of connectivity motifs in the graph of pyramidal cells are predicted quite accurately from node degrees using the configuration model of random graphs. Cells receiving more connections from nearby cells exhibit stronger and more reliable visual responses. These example findings illustrate the resources utility for relating structure and function of cortical circuits as well as for neuronal cell biology.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been considered to deliver biological cargos between cells and mediate intercellular communication. However, the mechanisms that underlie the biological process of EV uptake and cytoplasmic cargo release in recipient cells are largely unknown. Quantitative and real-time assays for assessment of the cargo delivery efficiency inside recipient cells have not been feasible. In this study, we developed an EV cargo delivery (EVCD) assay using a split luciferase called the NanoBiT system. Recipient cells expressing LgBiT, a large subunit of luciferase, emit luminescence when the EV cargo proteins fused with a small luminescence tag (HiBiT tag) that can complement LgBiT are delivered to the cytoplasm of recipient cells. Using the EVCD assay, the cargo delivery efficiency of EVs could be quantitatively measured in real time. This assay was highly sensitive in detecting a single event of cargo delivery per cell. We found that modification of EVs with a virus-derived fusogenic protein significantly enhanced the cytoplasmic cargo delivery; however, in the absence of a fusogenic protein, the cargo delivery efficiency of EVs was below the threshold of the assay. The EVCD assay could assess the effect of entry inhibitors on EV cargo delivery. Furthermore, using a luminescence microscope, the cytoplasmic cargo delivery of EVs was directly visualized in living cells. This assay could reveal the biological mechanism of the cargo delivery processes of EVs.",

    "abstract": "Dating the tree of life is central to understanding the evolution of life on Earth. Molecular clocks calibrated with fossils represent the state of the art for inferring the ages of major groups. Yet, other information on the timing of species diversification can be used to date the tree of life. For example, horizontal gene transfer events and ancient coevolutionary relationships such as (endo)symbioses can imply temporal relationships between two nodes in a phylogeny (Davin et al. 2018). These alternative sources of temporal constraints can be particularly helpful when the geological record is sparse, e.g. for microorganisms, which represent the vast majority of extant and extinct biodiversity.\n\nHere, we present a new method to combine fossil calibrations and relative age constraints to estimate chronograms. We provide an implementation of relative age constraints in RevBayes (Hohna et al. 2016) that can be combined in a modular manner with the wide range of molecular dating methods available in the software.\n\nWe use both realistic simulations and empirical datasets of 40 Cyanobacteria and 62 Archaea to evaluate our method. We show that the combination of relative age constraints with fossil calibrations significantly improves the estimation of node ages.",

Analysis of these structures identifies a conserved secondary structure switch in the 16S rRNA central to decoding site maturation, and suggests both a sequential order of action and molecular mechanisms for the assembly factors in coordinating and controlling this switch.

    "abstract": "Biotechnology requires efficient microbial cell factories. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important cell factory but for a sustainable use of natural resources more diverse cellular attributes are essential. Here, we benchmarked non-conventional yeasts Kluyveromyces marxianus (KM) and Rhodotorula toruloides (RT) against the extensively characterized strains of S. cerevisiae, CEN.PK and W303. We developed a computational method for the characterization of cell/vacuole volumes and observed an inverse relationship between the maximal growth rate and the median cell volume that was responsive to monovalent cations. We found that the supplementation of certain K+ concentrations to CEN.PK cultures containing 1.0 M Na+ increased the specific growth rate by four-fold with a parabolic shift in the median cell/vacuole volumes. The impairment of ethanol and acetate utilization in CEN.PK, acetate in W303, at the higher K+/Na+ concentrations implied an interference in the metabolic pathways required for their consumption. In RT cultures, the supplementation of K+/Na+ induced a trade-off in glucose utilization but alleviated cellular aggregates formation where specified cationic concentrations increased the beta-carotene yield by 60% compared with the reference. Our comparative analysis of cell/vacuole volumes using exponential phase cultures showed that the median volumes decreased the most for KM and the least for RT in response to studied cations. Noteworthy for the implication in aging research using yeasts, the vacuole to cell volume ratio increased with the increase in cell volume for W303 and KM, but not for CEN.PK and RT.\n\nImportanceFor designing efficient bioprocesses characterization of microbial cell factories in the relevant culture environment is important. The control of cell volume in response to salt stress is crucial for the productivity of microbial cell factories. We developed an open source computational method for the analysis of optical microscopy images that allowed us to quantify changes in cell/vacuole volumes in response to common salts in yeasts. Our study provides a framework for appreciating the role of cellular/organellar volumes in response to changing physiological environment. Our analysis showed that K+/Na+ interactions could be used for improving the cellular fitness of CEN.PK and increasing the productivity of beta-carotene in R. toruloides, which is a commercially important antioxidant and a valuable additive in foods.",

    "abstract": "As of yet, no standard of care incorporates biomaterials to treat traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). However, intense development of biomaterials for treating SCI has focused on fabricating microscale channels to support the regrowth of axons while minimizing scar formation. We previously demonstrated that plant tissues could be decellularized and processed to form sterile, biocompatible and implantable biomaterials that support cell infiltration and vascularization in vivo. Vascularized plant tissues contain continuous microscale channels with geometries relevant for supporting neural regeneration. We hypothesized that decellularized vascular bundles would support neural regeneration and motor recovery in SCI. Sprague Dawley rats received a complete T8-T9 spinal cord transection and were implanted with acellular plant-derived scaffolds and allowed to recover over 28 weeks. Animals that received the scaffolds alone, with no other therapeutic compounds, demonstrated a significant and stable partial improvement in motor function compared to control animals as early as week 4 post-injury. Hind-limb motor function did not deteriorate over the remaining 28 weeks. Histological analysis revealed minimal astrocyte scarring at the spinal cord - scaffold interface, aligned axonal projection through the scaffolds, populations of serotonergic neurons and Schwann cells, laminin and collagen deposition and the presence of blood vessels. Axonal reconnection via the scaffold was also confirmed by Fluro-gold retrograde tracing. Taken together, our work defines a novel route for building upon naturally occurring plant microarchitectures to support the repair of the spinal cord post-injury. Notably, these results were achieved without the use of growth factors, stem/progenitor cells, or any other interventions.",

Although MAIT cells are identified by a semi-invariant T cell receptor, their phenotypic and functional heterogeneity is not well understood. Here we present an integrated single cell transcriptomic analysis of over 76,000 human MAIT cells during acute and chronic antigen-specific activation with the MR1 ligand 5-OP-RU and non-specific TCR stimulation. We show that MAIT cells span a broad range of homeostatic, effector, helper, tissue-infiltrating, regulatory, and exhausted phenotypes, with distinct gene expression programs associated with CD4+ or CD8+ co-expression. During acute activation, MAIT cells rapidly adopt a cytotoxic phenotype characterized by high expression of GZMB, IFNG and TNF. In contrast, chronic stimulation induces heterogeneous states defined by proliferation, cytotoxicity, immune modulation, and exhaustion. These scRNAseq-defined MAIT cell subtypes were also detected in individuals recently exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, confirming their presence during human infection. Our study provides the first comprehensive atlas of human MAIT cells in activation conditions and defines substantial functional heterogeneity, suggesting complex roles in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Successful self-control requires the ability to stop unwanted actions or thoughts. Stopping is regarded as a central function of inhibitory control, a mechanism enabling the suppression of diverse mental content, and strongly associated with the prefrontal cortex. A domain-general inhibitory control capacity, however, would require the region or regions implementing it to dynamically shift top-down inhibitory connectivity to diverse target regions in the brain. Here we show that stopping unwanted thoughts and stopping unwanted actions engage common regions in the right anterior dorsolateral and right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and that both areas exhibit this dynamic targeting capacity. Within each region, pattern classifiers trained to distinguish stopping actions from making actions also could identify when people were suppressing their thoughts (and vice versa) and could predict which people successfully forgot thoughts after inhibition. Effective connectivity analysis revealed that both regions contributed to action and thought stopping, by dynamically shifting inhibitory connectivity to motor area M1 or to the hippocampus, depending on the goal, suppressing task-specific activity in those regions. These findings support the existence of a domain-general inhibitory control mechanism that contributes to self-control and establish dynamic inhibitory targeting as a key mechanism enabling these abilities.",

This study aimed to characterize the novel bacteriophage SaGU1 as a potential agent for phage therapy to treat S. aureus infections. SaGU1 that infects S. aureus strains previously isolated from the skin of patients with AD was screened from sewage samples in Gifu, Japan. Its genome was sequenced and analyzed using bioinformatics tools, and the morphology, lytic activity, stability, and host range of the phage were determined. The SaGU1 genome consisted of 140,909 bp with an average GC content of 30.2%. The viral chromosome contained putative 225 protein-coding genes and four tRNA genes, carrying neither toxic nor antibiotic resistance genes. Electron microscopy analysis revealed that SaGU1 belongs to the Myoviridae family. Stability tests showed that SaGU1 was heat-stable under physiological and acidic conditions. Host-range testing revealed that SaGU1 could infect a broad range of S. aureus clinical isolates present on the skin of patients with AD, whereas it did not kill strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are symbiotic bacteria in the human skin microbiota. Our data suggest that SaGU1 is a potential candidate for developing a phage therapy to treat AD caused by pathogenic S. aureus.",

Herein we report the bioassay guided fractionation of marine extracts from sponges Lendenfeldia, Ircinia and Dysidea that led us to identify novel compounds with antimicrobial properties. Tertiary amines or quaternary amine salts: anilines 1, benzylamines 2, tertiary amines 3 and 4, and quaternary amine salt 5, along with three known compounds (6-8) were isolated from a crude extract and MeOH eluent marine extracts. The absolute configurations of the new compounds were assigned based on tandem mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Several of the compounds exhibited potent in-vitro antibacterial activity, especially against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (MICs from 15.6 to 62.5 micro g/mL). Herein, we also, report structure activity relationships of a diverse range of commercial structurally similar compounds. The structure activity relationships (SARs) results clearly demonstrate that modification of the amines through linear chain length, and inclusion of aromatic rings, modifies the observed antimicrobial activity towards different biological activity. Several commercially available compounds, which are structurally related to the molecules we discovered showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against different test pathogens with an MIC50 range of 50 to 0.01 microM. The results of cross-referencing antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity establish that these compounds are promising potential lead molecules, with a favourable therapeutic index for antimicrobial drug development.

    "abstract": "The Endogenous Peptide Inhibitor of CXCR4 (EPI-X4) is a body-own fragment of albumin and specific antagonist of the CXC-motif-chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4). CXCR4 signaling is induced by its sole chemokine ligand CXCL12 and is involved in a plethora of functions including cell homing, differentiation, survival and angiogenesis. Consequently, dysregulation of CXCR4 is involved in a variety of disorders, such as cancer or inflammatory diseases, making CXCR4 an attractive drug target. EPI-X4 and derivatives with increased CXCR4 binding affinities represent promising leads as CXCR4 antagonists and have shown therapeutic activity in mouse models of inflammatory diseases. However, it is currently unclear how EPI-X4 and its derivatives interact with CXCR4. Here, by combining biomolecular simulations with experimental mutagenesis and activity studies we investigated the binding behavior of EPI-X4 to CXCR4 at the molecular level. Our work allowed us to show that the EPI-X4 peptide interacts primarily in the minor pocket of CXCR4 through its N-terminal residues. The biomolecular interactions highlighted by the computational studies are in good agreement with the experimental mutagenesis data. Moreover, we found that the N-terminal seven amino-acids of EPI-X4 (a 16-mer) and its improved derivatives (12-mers) are sufficient for CXCR4 binding, which led to the development of shorter leads with optimized CXCR4 antagonizing properties. Collectively, we here established how EPI-X4 binds to its receptor and used this knowledge for rational drug design. The new peptide variants developed by us are more potent in terms of inhibiting CXCR4-downstream signaling and cancer cell migration, without toxic effects.",

This population is at the southern tip of a well-studied US latitudinal cline. On the non-inversion-carrying chromosome arms, 11-16% of SNPs show significant frequency changes. These are enriched for latitudinal clines and genic sites. For clinal SNPs each allele is either the northern- or southern-favored. Seventy-eight to 95 percent with significant frequency increase are southern-favored. Five to seven percent of SNPs also show significant seasonal change and involve increases in the northern-favored allele during the season. On the 2L and 3R chromosome arms there are significant seasonal shifts for common inversions. We identify regions and genes that are candidates for selection. These regions also show correspondence with those associated with soft sweeps in Raleigh, NC. This shift towards southern-favored alleles may be caused by climate shifts or increased African-European admixture.",

The chromatin can be organized near the lamina layer of the nuclear envelope, conventionally fill the nucleus, be organized centrally, or as a wetting droplet. These transitions are controlled by changes in nuclear volume and the interaction of chromatin with the lamina (part of the nuclear envelope) at the nuclear periphery. Using a simple polymeric model that includes the key features of chromatin self-attraction and its binding to the lamina, we demonstrate theoretically that it is the competition of these two effects that determines the mode of chromatin distribution. The qualitative trends as well as the compositional profiles obtained in our simulations compare well with the observed intact-organism imaging and quantification. Since the simulations contain only a small number of physical variables we can identify the generic mechanisms underlying the changes in the observed phase separations.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria use intercellular signaling, or quorum sensing (QS), to share information and respond collectively to aspects of their surroundings. The autoinducers that carry this information are exposed to the external environment; consequently, they are affected by factors such as removal through fluid flow, a ubiquitous feature of bacterial habitats ranging from the gut and lungs to lakes and oceans. To understand how QS genetic architectures in cells promote appropriate populationlevel phenotypes throughout the bacterial life cycle requires knowledge of how these architectures determine the QS response in realistic spatiotemporally varying flow conditions. Here, we develop and apply a general theory that identifies and quantifies the conditions required for QS activation in fluid flow by systematically linking cell- and population-level genetic and physical processes. We predict that, when a subset of the population meets these conditions, cell-level positive feedback promotes a robust collective response by overcoming flow-induced autoinducer concentration gradients. By accounting for a dynamic flow in our theory, we predict that positive feedback in cells acts as a low-pass filter at the population level in oscillatory flow, allowing a population to respond only to changes in flow that occur over slow enough timescales. Our theory is readily extendable, and provides a framework for assessing the functional roles of diverse QS network architectures in realistic flow conditions.",

The question raised how differentiation and tumor progression, two apparently antagonist processes, coexist and allow tumor malignancy. We first identified the most transcriptionally homogeneous LMS subgroup in three independent cohorts, which we named  hLMS. The integration of multi-omics data and functional analysis suggests that hLMS originate from vascular smooth muscle cells and show that hLMS transcriptional program reflects both modulation of smooth muscle contraction activity controlled by MYOCD/SRF regulatory network and activation of the cell cycle activity controlled by E2F/RB1 pathway. We propose that the phenotypic plasticity of vascular smooth muscle cells coupled with MYOCD/SRF pathway amplification, essential for hLMS survival, concomitant with PTEN absence and RB1 alteration, could explain how hLMS balance this uncommon interplay between differentiation and aggressiveness.",

It could be curable at the first stages, but the progress of the disease and reaching to the stage-4 could make shift the treatments from curative to palliative. In this stage, the survival rate is meager, and therapy options are limited. The question is, what are the hallmarks of this stage and what genes are involved? What mechanism and pathways could drive such a malign shift from stage-1 to stage-4? In this study, first we identified the core modules for both the stage-1 and stage-4 which four of them have a significant role in stage-1 and two of them have a role in stage-4. Then we investigated the gene ontology and hallmarks analysis for each stage. According to the results, the immune-related process, especially interferon-gamma, impacts stage-1 in colorectal cancer. Concerning stage-4, extracellular matrix ontologies, and metastatic hallmarks are in charge. At last, we performed a differentially expressed gene analysis of stage-4 vs. stage-1 and analyzed their pathways which reasonably undergone a hypo/hyperactivity or being abnormally regulated through the cancer progression. We found that lncRNA in canonical WNT signaling and colon cancer has the most significant pathways, followed by WNT signaling, which means that these pathways may be the driver for the development from early-stage to late-stage. Of these lncRNAs, we had two upregulated kind, H19, and HOTAIR, which both can be involved and mediate metastasis and invasion in colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "In the hippocampus, the excitatory synapse between dentate granule cell axons - or mossy fibers (MF) - and CA3 pyramidal cells (MF-CA3) expresses robust forms of short-term plasticity, such as frequency facilitation and post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). These forms of plasticity are due to increases in neurotransmitter release, and can be engaged when dentate granule cells fire in bursts (e.g. during exploratory behaviors) and bring CA3 pyramidal neurons above threshold. While frequency facilitation at this synapse is limited by endogenous activation of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors, whether MF-PTP can be regulated in an activity-dependent manner is unknown. Here, using physiologically relevant patterns of mossy fiber stimulation in acute mouse hippocampal slices, we found that disrupting postsynaptic Ca2+ dynamics increases MF-PTP, strongly suggesting a form of Ca2+-dependent retrograde suppression of this form of plasticity. PTP suppression requires a few seconds of MF bursting activity and Ca2+ release from internal stores. Our findings raise the possibility that the powerful MF-CA3 synapse can negatively regulate its own strength not only during PTP-inducing activity typical of normal exploratory behaviors, but also during epileptic activity.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe powerful mossy fiber-CA3 synapse exhibits strong forms of plasticity that are engaged during location-specific exploration, when dentate granule cells fire in bursts. While this synapse is well-known for its presynaptically-expressed LTP and LTD, much less is known about the robust changes that occur on a shorter time scale. How such short-term plasticity is regulated, in particular, remains poorly understood. Unexpectedly, an in vivo-like pattern of presynaptic activity induced robust post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) only when the postsynaptic cell was loaded with a high concentration of Ca2+ buffer, indicating a form of Ca2+-dependent retrograde suppression of PTP. Such suppression may have profound implications for how environmental cues are encoded into neural assemblies, and for limiting network hyperexcitability during seizures.",

However, the neural mechanisms underlying the generation of food motivation remain poorly understood. We investigated these mechanisms by subdividing feeding-related motivated behaviours into food-seeking, evaluating, and swallowing. Micro-endoscopic results indicated that neurons containing leptin receptors (LepRs) in the lateral hypothalamus (LH) are the major food-specific subpopulation of LHGABA neurons. Optogenetic manipulation of LHLepR neurons bidirectionally regulated both food-seeking and evaluating. Furthermore, micro-endoscope data revealed that distinct LHLepR neurons encode seeking and evaluating. Computational modelling analysis demonstrated that LHLepR neurons encode motivation, whereas neurons containing agouti-related peptide and neuropeptide Y (AgRP/NPY) encode the need for food. Additionally, slice studies revealed that NPY decreases inhibitory input to LHLepR neurons via LHGABA interneurons. This mechanism explains the permissive gate role of hunger (food need) in seeking/evaluating motivation. Together, the present study provides a comprehensive neural mechanism of how physiological needs drive distinct motivated behaviours.",

    "abstract": "The receptor for colony stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1R) is important for the survival and function of myeloid cells that mediate pathology during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS). CSF-1 and IL-34, the ligands of CSF-1R, have similar bioactivities but distinct tissue and context-dependent expression patterns, suggesting that they have different roles. This could be the case in EAE, given that CSF-1 expression is upregulated in the CNS, while IL-34 remains constitutively expressed. We found that targeting CSF-1 with neutralizing mAb halted ongoing EAE, with efficacy superior to CSF-1R inhibitor BLZ945, whereas IL-34 neutralization had no effect, suggesting that pathogenic myeloid cells were maintained by CSF-1, not IL-34. Both anti-CSF-1- and BLZ945-treatment greatly reduced numbers of monocyte-derived cells and microglia in the CNS. However, anti-CSF-1 selectively depleted inflammatory microglia and monocytes in inflamed CNS areas, whereas BLZ945 depleted virtually all myeloid cells, including quiescent microglia, throughout the CNS. Anti-CSF-1 treatments reduced the size of demyelinated lesions, and microglial activation in the grey matter. Lastly, we found that bone marrow-derived immune cells were the major mediators of CSF-1R-dependent pathology, while microglia played a lesser role. Our findings suggest that targeting CSF-1 could be effective in ameliorating MS pathology, while preserving the homeostatic functions of myeloid cells, thereby minimizing risks associated with total ablation of CSF-1R-dependent cells.\n\nSignificance StatementMultiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), are autoimmune diseases characterized by accumulation of myeloid immune cells into the central nervous system (CNS). Both harmful and beneficial myeloid cells are present in EAE/MS, and a goal of MS therapy is to preferentially remove harmful myeloid cells. The receptor for CSF-1 (CSF-1R) is found on myeloid cells and it is important for their survival. CSF-1R can bind two ligands, CSF-1 and IL-34, but is unknown whether their functions in EAE/MS differ. We found that blocking CSF-1 depleted only harmful myeloid cells in the CNS and suppressed EAE, whereas blocking IL-34 had no effect. Thus, we propose that blocking CSF-1 could be a novel therapy for MS.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe importance of post-divergence gene flow in speciation has been documented across a range of taxa in recent years, and may have been especially widespread in highly mobile, wide-ranging marine species, such as cetaceans. Here, we studied individual genomes from nine species across the three families of the toothed whale superfamily Delphinoidea (Delphinidae, Phocoenidae, Monodontidae). To investigate the role of post-divergence gene flow in the speciation process, we used a multifaceted approach, including: (i) phylogenomics, (ii) the distribution of shared derived alleles, and (iii) demographic inference. We found the divergence of lineages within Delphinoidea did not follow a process of pure bifurcation, but was much more complex. Sliding-window phylogenomics reveal a high prevalence of discordant topologies within the superfamily, with further analyses indicating these discordances arose due to both incomplete lineage sorting and gene flow. D-statistics, D-foil, and f-branch analyses supported gene flow between members of Delphinoidea, with the vast majority of gene flow occurring as ancient interfamilial events. Demographic analyses provided evidence that introgressive gene flow has likely ceased between all species pairs tested, despite reports of contemporary interspecific hybrids. Our study provides the first steps towards resolving the large complexity of speciation within Delphinoidea; we reveal the prevalence of ancient interfamilial gene flow events prior to the diversification of each family, and suggests that contemporary hybridisation events may be disadvantageous, as hybrid individuals do not appear to contribute to the parental species gene pools.",

The proteins encoded by these genes play major fibrosis-related roles in inflammasome formation, degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and remodeling of the extracellular matrix and vasculature, autocrine regulation of fibrosis, or cell signaling. Our analyses showed that the first four of these genes had super-enhancers (unusually strong enhancer clusters) that correlate with their very high expression in monocytes, neutrophils, fibroblasts, or venous cells. Expression of the gene encoding miR-223, a micro-RNA that plays an important role in downregulating NLRP3 protein levels, is also probably driven by the super-enhancer in which it is embedded. Enhancer chromatin for all these genes was inside as well as outside the gene body. While AGT, which encodes precursors of angiotensin II, lacked a super-enhancer, its tissue-specific expression profile correlates with the tissue-specific enhancer chromatin extending into its distant silent gene neighbor (CAPN9). Tissue-specific peaks of DNA hypomethylation, open chromatin (DNaseI hypersensitivity), and transcription factor binding were detected in subregions of these super-enhancers/enhancers that are likely to be the main drivers of expression of their associated gene. We found that CCN2/CTGF is co-expressed with its far-upstream neighbor LINC01013, a noncoding RNA gene, specifically in vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and chondrocytes. Evidence from chromatin looping profiling (Hi-C) suggests coregulation of these genes in HUVEC. Our findings indicate the importance of understanding the often-overlooked roles of enhancers and their hypomethylated, transcription factor-binding subregions in the regulation of expression of fibrosis-related genes in normal and fibrotic tissue.",

    "abstract": "Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we study the interaction of ternary methacrylate polymers, composed of charged cationic, hydrophobic and neutral polar groups, with model bacterial membrane. Our simulation data shows that the random ternary polymers can penetrate deep into the membrane interior and partitioning of even a single polymer has a pronounced effect on the membrane structure. Lipid reorganization, on polymer binding, shows a strong affinity of the ternary polymer for anionic POPG lipids and the same is compared with the control case of binary polymers (only cationic and hydrophobic groups). While binary polymers exhibit strong propensity of acquired amphiphilic conformations upon membrane insertion, our results strongly suggest that such amphiphilic conformations are absent in the case of random ternary polymers. The ternary polymers adopt a more folded conformation, staying aligned in the direction of the membrane normal and subsequently penetrating deeper into the membrane interior suggesting a novel membrane partitioning mechanism without amphiphilic conformations. Finally, we also examine the interactions of ternary polymer aggregates with model bacterial membranes, which show that replacing some of the hydrophobic groups by polar groups leads to weakly held ternary aggregates enabling them to undergo rapid partitioning and insertion into membrane interior. Our work thus underscores the role of inclusion of polar groups into the framework of traditional binary biomimetic antimicrobial polymers and suggests different mode of partitioning into bacterial membranes, mimicking antimicrobial mechanism of globular antimicrobial peptides like Defensin.",

    "abstract": "Lineage plasticity, the ability of a cell to alter its identity, is an increasingly common mechanism of adaptive resistance to targeted therapy in cancer1,2. An archetypal example is the development of neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) after treatment of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) with inhibitors of androgen signaling. NEPC is an aggressive variant of prostate cancer that aberrantly expresses genes characteristic of neuroendocrine (NE) tissues and no longer depends on androgens. To investigate the epigenomic basis of this resistance mechanism, we profiled histone modifications in NEPC and PRAD patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) using chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq). We identified a vast network of cis-regulatory elements (N~15,000) that are recurrently activated in NEPC. The FOXA1 transcription factor (TF), which pioneers androgen receptor (AR) chromatin binding in the prostate epithelium3,4, is reprogrammed to NE-specific regulatory elements in NEPC. Despite loss of dependence upon AR, NEPC maintains FOXA1 expression and requires FOXA1 for proliferation and expression of NE lineage-defining genes. Ectopic expression of the NE lineage TFs ASCL1 and NKX2-1 in PRAD cells reprograms FOXA1 to bind to NE regulatory elements and induces enhancer activity as evidenced by histone modifications at these sites. Our data establish the importance of FOXA1 in NEPC and provide a principled approach to identifying novel cancer dependencies through epigenomic profiling.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence supports that pharmacological application of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) suppresses appetite but also promotes sickness-like behaviors in rodents via GDNF family receptor -like (GFRAL)-dependent mechanisms1,2. Conversely, the endogenous regulation and secretion of GDF15 and its physiological effects on energy homeostasis and behavior remain elusive. Here we show, in four independent studies that prolonged, moderate- to high-intensity endurance exercise substantially increases circulating GDF15, in a time-dependent and reversible fashion, to peak levels otherwise only observed in pathophysiological conditions. This exercise-induced increase can be recapitulated in mice following forced treadmill running and is accompanied by increased Gdf15 expression in the liver, skeletal muscle, and heart muscle. Compared to other metabolic stressors, like fasting, acute high-fat diet feeding, severe caloric excess and temperature changes, exercise has a greater impact on circulating GDF15 levels. However, whereas pharmacological GDF15 inhibits appetite and suppresses wheel running activity via GFRAL, in response to exercise, the physiological induction of GDF15 does not. In summary, exercise-induced circulating GDF15 correlates with the duration of endurance exercise. However, higher GDF15 levels after exercise are not sufficient to evoke canonical pharmacological GDF15 effects on appetite or responsible for exercise aversion/fatigue. Thus, the physiological effects of GDF15 as an exerkine remain elusive.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 infection is initiated by the viral glycoprotein Env, which, after interaction with cellular coreceptors, adopts a transient conformation known as the pre-hairpin intermediate (PHI). The N-heptad repeat (NHR) is a highly conserved region of gp41 exposed in the PHI; it is the target of the FDA-approved drug enfuvirtide and of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). However, to date these mAbs have only been weakly effective against tier-1 HIV-1 strains, which are most sensitive to neutralizing antibodies. Here, we engineered and tested 11 IgG variants of D5, an anti-NHR mAb, by recombining previously described mutations in four of D5s six antibody complementarity-determining regions. One variant, D5_AR, demonstrated 6-fold enhancement in ID50 against lentivirus pseudotyped with HXB2 Env. Importantly, D5_AR exhibited weak cross-clade neutralizing activity against a diverse set of tier-2 HIV-1 viruses, which are less sensitive to neutralizing antibodies than tier-1 viruses and are the target of current antibody-based vaccine efforts. In addition, the neutralization potency of D5_AR IgG was greatly enhanced in target cells expressing Fc{gamma}RI with ID50 values below 0.1 g/mL; this immunoglobulin receptor is expressed on macrophages and dendritic cells, which are implicated in the early stages of HIV-1 infection of mucosal surfaces. D5 and D5_AR have equivalent neutralization potency in IgG, Fab, and scFv formats, indicating that neutralization is not impacted by steric hindrance. Taken together, these results provide support for vaccine strategies that target the PHI by eliciting antibodies against the gp41 NHR.\n\nImportanceDespite advances in anti-retroviral therapy, HIV remains a global epidemic and has claimed more than 32 million lives. Accordingly, developing an effective vaccine remains an urgent public health need. The gp41 N-heptad repeat (NHR) of the HIV-1 pre-hairpin intermediate (PHI) is highly conserved (>90%) and is inhibited by the FDA-approved drug enfuvirtide, making it an attractive vaccine target. However, to date NHR antibodies have not been potent. Here, we engineered D5_AR, a more potent variant of the anti-NHR antibody D5, and established its ability to inhibit HIV-1 strains that are more difficult to neutralize and are more representative of circulating strains (tier-2 strains). The neutralizing activity of D5_AR was greatly potentiated in cells expressing Fc{gamma}RI; Fc{gamma}RI is expressed on cells that are implicated at the earliest stages of sexual HIV-1 transmission. Taken together, these results bolster efforts to target the gp41 NHR and the PHI for vaccine development.",

Chemoprophylaxis vaccination (CVac) has proven to be the most effective vaccine strategy against malaria. Though CVac with WT sporozoites confers better immunity, the overhanging threat of drug resistance limits its use as a vaccine. Here, we demonstrate that a liver stage-specific mutant of Plasmodium berghei when used as a vaccine under a CVac regimen provides superior long-lasting protection, in both inbred and outbred mice, as compared to WT-CVac. Uniquely, the protection elicited by this mutant is predominantly dependent on a CD8+T-cell response through an IFN-{gamma}-independent mechanism and is associated with a stable population of antigen-experienced CD8+T cells. Jointly, our findings support the benefit of liver stage mutants as vaccines over WT, under a CVac protocol. This vaccination strategy is also a powerful model to study the mechanisms of protective immunity and discover new protective antigens.",

We use multiple lines of independent evidence to show that different variant types in a single gene, SATB1, cause clinically overlapping but distinct neurodevelopmental disorders. Clinical evaluation of 42 individuals carrying SATB1 variants identified overt genotype-phenotype relationships, associated with different pathophysiological mechanisms, established by functional assays. Missense variants in the CUT1 and CUT2 DNA-binding domains result in stronger chromatin binding, increased transcriptional repression and a severe phenotype. Contrastingly, variants predicted to result in haploinsufficiency are associated with a milder clinical presentation. A similarly mild phenotype is observed for individuals with premature protein truncating variants that escape nonsense-mediated decay and encode truncated proteins, which are transcriptionally active but mislocalized in the cell. Our results suggest that in-depth mutation-specific genotype-phenotype studies are essential to capture full disease complexity and to explain phenotypic variability.",

Although several studies indicated that Grb7 amplifies EGFR-mediated signaling in cancers, the detailed regulatory mechanism of whether and how Grb7 is involved in EGFR-mediated lung cancer progression remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that EGF-regulated Grb7 phosphorylation promotes lung cancer progression through phosphorylation of STAT3. Intrinsically, EGF/EGFR signal is required for the formation of Grb7/STAT3 complex as well as its nuclear accumulation. Once in the nucleus, STAT3 interacts with EPHA4 promoter, which in turn affects the gene expression level of EPHA4 through transcriptional regulation. Functionally, EphA4 together with EGFR promotes cancer migration, proliferation, and anchorage-independent growth. Our study reveals a novel mechanism in which Grb7 contribute to lung cancer malignancies through its interaction with STAT3 that leads to sequential regulation of EPHA4 gene expression in an EGF/EGFR signal-dependent manner.",

Yet simply negating the existence of biological differences has detrimental consequences for all sexes and genders, particularly for the development of accurate diagnostic tools, effective drugs and understanding of disease. The most well-established morphological difference is size, with males having on average a larger brain than females; yet a mechanistic understanding of how this difference arises remains to be elucidated. Here, we use brain organoids to test the roles of sex chromosomes and sex steroids during development. While we show no observable differences between XX and XY brain organoids, sex steroids, namely androgens, increase proliferation of cortical neural progenitors. Transcriptomic analysis reveals effects on chromatin remodelling and HDAC activity, both of which are also implicated in the male-biased conditions autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia. Finally, we show that higher numbers of progenitors result specifically in increased upper-layer excitatory neurons. These findings uncover a hitherto unknown role for male sex hormones in regulating excitatory neuron number within the human neocortex and represent a first step towards understanding the origin of human sex-related brain differences.",

Here we show that the position of axon initiation in embryonic zebrafish spinal neurons is extremely consistent across neuronal sub-types. We investigated what mechanisms may regulate axon positioning in vivo and found that microtubule organising centres are located distant from the site of axon initiation in contrast to that observed in vitro, and that microtubule plus-ends are not enriched in the axon during axon initiation. F-actin accumulation precedes axon formation and nascent axons form but are not stabilised in the absence of microtubules.

In this study, we analyzed different methodologies for production of bovine haploid androgenetic embryos (hAE) to elucidate the causes behind their poor developmental potential. The results showed that hAE can be efficiently generated by using intracytoplasmic sperm injection and oocyte enucleation at telophase II. Although haploidy does not disturb early development up to around the 3rd mitotic division, androgenetic development is disturbed after the time of zygote genome activation those that reach the morula stage are less capable to become a blastocyst. Analysis of gene expression indicated abnormal levels of methyltransferase 3B and key long non-coding RNAs involved in X-chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting of the KCNQ1 locus, which is associated to the methylation status of imprinted control regions of XIST and KCNQ1OT1. Thus, our results seem to exclude micromanipulation consequences and chromosomal abnormalities as major factors in developmental restriction, suggesting that their early developmental constraint is regulated at an epigenetic level.",

    "abstract": "To date, the mechanisms of CaCO3 nucleus formation and crystal growth induced by bacterial cells still remain debatable. Here, an insight on the role of planktonic cells of Bacillus licheniformis DSMZ 8782 in the biomineralization is presented. We showed that during 14-days bacterial growth in a liquid urea/Ca2+-containing medium the transformation of CaCO3 polymorphs followed the classical pathway \"ACC-vaterite-calcite/aragonite\". By microscopic techniques, we detected the formation of extracellular matrix (ECM) around the cells at the stage of exponential growth and appearance of electron-dense inclusions at 24 h after the inoculation. The cells formed filaments and created a network, the nodes of which served as sites for further crystal growth. The ECM formation accompanied with the expression of proteins required for biofilm formation, the aldehyde/alcohol dehydrogenase, stress-associated Clp family proteins, and a porin family protein (ompA ortholog) associated with bacterial extracellular vesicles. We demonstrated that urea and CaCl2 acted as denaturing agents causing matrix formation in addition to their traditional role as a source of carbonate and Ca2+ ions. We showed that CaCO3 nucleation occured inside B. licheniformis cells and further crystal growth and polymorphic transformations took place in the extracellular matrix without attaching to the cell surface. The spatial arrangement of the cells was important for the active crystal growth and dependent on environmental factors. The extracellular matrix played a double role being formed as a stress response and providing a favorable microenvironment for biomineralization (a high concentration of ions necessary for CaCO3 crystal aggregation, fixation and stabilization).",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) negatively regulate gene expression by cleaving the target mRNA and/or impairing its translation, thereby playing a crucial role in plant development and environmental stress responses. In Arabidopsis, MIR840 is located within the overlapping 3UTR of PPR and WHIRLY3 (WHY3), both being predicted targets of miR840. Gain- and loss-of-function of miR840 in Arabidopsis resulted in opposite senescent phenotypes. Highest expression of pri-miR840 is observed at senescence initiation, and is negatively correlated with a significant reduction of PPR transcripts but not of WHY3. Although WHY3 transcript levels were not significantly affected by miR840 overexpression, its protein synthesis was strongly reduced. Mutating the cleavage sites or replacing the target sequences abolishes the miR840-mediated degradation of PPR transcripts and inhibition of WHY3 translation. In support for this, concurrent knock-down of both PPR and WHY3 in the WT resulted in the senescent phenotype resembling that of the miR840-overexpressing mutant. This indicates that both PRR and WHY3 are targets in the miR840-regulated senescent pathway. Moreover, single knockout mutant of PPR or WHY3 shows a convergent up-regulated subset of senescence-associated genes, which are also found among those induced by miR840 overexpression. Our data provide evidences for a regulatory role of miR840 in plant senescence.\n\nHighlightMicroRNA840 (miR840) has a unique miRNA-target configuration regulating PPR and WHIRLY3 genes in Arabidopsis. MiR840 is highly expressed at the onset of plant senescent stage. Both PPR and WHIRLY3 transcripts are specifically targeted in vivo within their 3UTR region by mature miR840 or its star strand in vivo. Interestingly, PPR expression is mainly repressed on mRNA transcript level by cleavage, while WHIRLY3 is predominantly translationally inhibited. We conclude that miR840 enhances plant senescence via post transcriptional gene silencing of PPR and WHIRLY3, which appear to be novel negative joint regulators of plant senescence.\n\nFootnote: The author(s) responsible for distribution of materials integral to the findings presented in this article in accordance with the policy described in the intructions for Authors is: Ying Miao (ymiao@fafu.edu.cn)",

    "abstract": "Auxin metabolism is, together with auxin transport, a key determinant of auxin signalling output in plant cells, yet details on the underlying mechanisms and factors involved are still largely unknown. Processes involved in the auxin metabolism are subject to regulation based on numerous signals, including auxin concentration itself. Altered auxin availability and the subsequent changes of auxin metabolite profiles can therefore elucidate the function and regulatory role of individual elements in the auxin metabolic machinery.\n\nAfter analysing auxin metabolism in auxin dependent tobacco BY-2 cell line grown in presence or absence of synthetic auxin 2,4-D we found that both conditions were similarly characterized by very low levels of endogenous indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and its metabolites. However, metabolic profiling after exogenous application of IAA uncovered that the concentration of N-(2-oxindole-3-acetyl)-L-aspartic acid (oxIAA-Asp), the most abundantly formed auxin metabolite in the control culture, dramatically decreased in auxin-starved conditions. To describe the molecular mechanism behind this regulation, we analysed transcriptome and proteome changes caused by auxin starvation. While no changes in the expression of auxin biosynthetic machinery were observed, many genes related to auxin conjugation and degradation showed differential expression. Selected putative auxin glycosylating enzymes as well as members of the Gretchen Hagen 3 gene family involved in auxin amino acid conjugation showed both up- and down-regulation. Contrarily to that, all tobacco homologs of Arabidopsis thaliana DIOXYGENASE FOR AUXIN OXIDATION 1 (DAO1), known to be responsible for the formation of oxIAA from IAA, showed significant downregulation at both transcript and protein levels. To validate the role of DAO1 in auxin metabolism, we performed auxin metabolite profiling in BY-2 mutants carrying either siRNA-silenced or CRISPR-Cas9-mutated NtDAO1, as well as in dao1-1 Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Both mutants showed not only expectedly lower levels of oxIAA, but also significantly lower abundance of oxidated amino acid conjugates of IAA (oxIAA-Asp). Our results thus represent the first direct evidence on DAO1 activity on IAA amino acid conjugates.\n\nStatement of significanceHere we present an analysis of auxin metabolism on metabolite, transcript and protein levels in tobacco BY-2 cell line, collectively identifying oxidation of IAA amino acid conjugates as a new role of DIOXYGENASE FOR AUXIN OXIDATION 1 within an auxin-level-responsive metabolic system.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveExacerbated pro-inflammatory immune response contributes to COVID-19 pathology. Despite the evidence about SARS-CoV-2 infecting the human gut, little is known about the importance of the enteric phase of SARS-CoV-2 for the viral lifecycle and for the development of COVID-19-associated pathologies. Similarly, it remains unknown whether the innate immune response triggered in this organ to combat viral infection is similar or distinct compared to the one triggered in other organs.\n\nDesignWe exploited human ileum- and colon-derived organoids as a non-transformed culture model supporting SARS-CoV-2 infection. We characterized the replication kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 in intestinal epithelial cells and correlated the expression of the viral receptor ACE2 with infection. We performed conventional and targeted single-cell transcriptomics and multiplex single-molecule RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization and used IFN-reporter bioassays to characterize the response of primary human intestinal epithelial cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n\nResultsWe identified a subpopulation of enterocytes as the prime target of SARS-CoV-2. We found the lack of positive correlation between susceptibility to infection and the expression of ACE2 and revealed that SARS-CoV-2 downregulates ACE2 expression upon infection. Infected cells activated strong proinflammatory programs and produced interferon, while expression of interferon-stimulated genes was limited to bystander cells due to SARS-CoV-2 suppressing the autocrine action of interferon in infected cells.\n\nConclusionOur findings reveal that SARS-CoV-2 curtails the immune response in primary human intestinal epithelial cells to promote its replication and spread and this highlights the gut as a proinflammatory reservoir that should be considered to fully understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.\n\nSignificance of the studyWhat is already known about this subject? O_LICOVID-19 patients have gastrointestinal symptoms which likely correlates with SARS-CoV-2 infection of the intestinal epithelium\nC_LIO_LISARS-CoV-2 replicates in human intestinal epithelial cells.\nC_LIO_LIIntestinal organoids are a good model to study SARS-CoV-2 infection of the gastrointestinal tract\nC_LIO_LIThere is a limited interferon response in human lung epithelial cells upon SARS-CoV-2 infection.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the new findings? O_LIA specific subpopulation of enterocytes are the prime targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection of the human gut.\nC_LIO_LIThere is a lack of correlation between ACE2 expression and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection.

    "abstract": "K777 is a di-peptide analog that contains an electrophilic vinyl-sulfone moiety and is a potent, covalent inactivator of cathepsins. Vero E6, HeLa/ACE2, Caco-2, A549/ACE2, and Calu-3, cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2, and then treated with K777. K777 reduced viral infectivity with EC50 values of inhibition of viral infection of: 74 nM for Vero E6, <80 nM for A549/ACE2, and 4 nM for HeLa/ACE2 cells. In contrast, Calu-3 and Caco-2 cells had EC50 values in the low micromolar range. No toxicity of K777 was observed for any of the host cells at 10-100 M inhibitor. K777 did not inhibit activity of the papain-like cysteine protease and 3CL cysteine protease, encoded by SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations of [&le;] 100 M. These results suggested that K777 exerts its potent anti-viral activity by inactivation of mammalian cysteine proteases which are essential to viral infectivity. Using a propargyl derivative of K777 as an activity-based probe, K777 selectively targeted cathepsin B and cathepsin L in Vero E6 cells. However only cathepsin L cleaved the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and K777 blocked this proteolysis. The site of spike protein cleavage by cathepsin L was in the S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2, differing from the cleavage site observed in the SARS CoV-1 spike protein. These data support the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of K777 is mediated through inhibition of the activity of host cathepsin L and subsequent loss of viral spike protein processing.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe virus causing COVID-19 is highly infectious and has resulted in a global pandemic. We confirm that a cysteine protease inhibitor, approved by the FDA as a clinical-stage compound, inhibits SARS-CoV-2 infection of several human and monkey cell lines with notable(nanomolar) efficacy. The mechanism of action of this inhibitor is identified as a specific inhibition of host cell cathepsin L. This in turn inhibits host cell processing of the coronaviral spike protein, a step required for cell entry. Neither of the coronaviral proteases are inhibited, and the cleavage site of spike protein processing is different from that reported in other coronaviruses. Hypotheses to explain the differential activity of the inhibitor with different cell types are discussed.",

Nasal IVM spray (N-IVM-spray) administration may contribute to attaining high drug concentrations in nasopharyngeal (NP) tissue, a primary site of virus entrance/replication. The safety and pharmacokinetic performance of a new N-IVM spray formulation in a piglet model were assessed. Crossbred piglets (10-12 kg) were treated with either one or two (12 h apart) doses of N-IVM-spray (2 mg, 1 puff/nostril) or orally (0.2 mg/kg). The overall safety of N-IVM-spray was assessed (clinical, haematological, serum biochemical determinations), and histopathology evaluation of the application site tissues performed. The IVM concentration profiles measured in plasma and respiratory tract tissues (nasopharynx and lungs) after the nasal spray treatment (one and two applications) were compared with those achieved after the oral administration. Animals tolerated well the novel N-IVM-spray formulation. No local/systemic adverse events were observed. After nasal administration, the highest IVM concentrations were measured in NP and lung tissues. Significant increases in IVM concentration profiles in both NP-tissue and lungs were observed after the 2-dose nasal administrations. The nasal/oral IVM concentration ratios in NP and lung tissues (at 6 h post-dose) markedely increased by repeating the spray application. The fast attainment of high and persistent IVM concentrations in NP tissue is the main advantage of the nasal over the oral route. These original results are encouraging to support the undertaking of further clinical trials to evaluate the safety/efficacy of the nasal IVM spray application in the treatment and/or prevention of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infectivity is largely determined by the virus Spike protein binding to the ACE2 receptor. Meanwhile, marked infection rate differences were reported between populations and individuals. To understand the disease dynamic, we developed a computational approach to study the implications of both SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations and ACE2 polymorphism on the stability of the virus-receptor complex. We used the 6LZG PDB RBD/ACE2 3D model, the mCSM platform, the LigPlot+ and PyMol software to analyze the data on SARS-CoV-2 mutations and ACE variants retrieved from GISAID and Ensembl/GnomAD repository. We observed that out of 351 RBD point mutations, 83% destabilizes the complex according to free energy ({Delta}{Delta}G) differences. We also spotted variations in the patterns of polar and hydrophobic interactions between the mutations occurring in 15 out of 18 contact residues. Similarly, comparison of the effect on the complex stability of different ACE2 variants showed that the pattern of molecular interactions and the complex stability varies also according to ACE2 polymorphism. We infer that it is important to consider both ACE2 variants and circulating SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutations to assess the stability of the virus-receptor association and evaluate infectivity. This approach might offers a good molecular ground to mitigate the virus spreading.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has an RNA genome, which is, overall, closely related to the bat coronavirus sequence RaTG13. However, the ACE2-binding domain of this virus is more similar to a coronavirus isolated from a Guangdong pangolin. In addition to this unique feature, the genome of SARS-CoV-2 (and its closely related coronaviruses) has a low CpG content. This has been postulated to be the signature of an evolutionary pressure exerted by the host antiviral protein ZAP. Here, we analyzed the sequences of a wide range of viruses using both alignment-based and alignment free approaches to investigate the origin of SARS-CoV-2 genome. Our analyses revealed a high level of similarity between the 5UTR of SARS-CoV-2 and that of the Guangdong pangolin coronavirus. This suggests bat and pangolin coronaviruses might have recombined at least twice (in the 5UTR and ACE2 binding regions) to seed the formation of SARS-CoV-2. An alternative hypothesis is that the lineage preceding SARS-CoV-2 is a yet to be sampled bat coronavirus whose ACE2 binding domain and 5UTR are distinct from other known bat coronaviruses. Additionally, we performed a detailed analysis of viral genome compositions as well as expression and RNA binding data of ZAP to show that the low CpG abundance in SARS-CoV-2 is not related to an evolutionary pressure from ZAP.",

    "abstract": "Many older listeners have difficulty understanding speech in noise, when cues to speech-sound identity are less redundant. The amplitude envelope of speech fluctuates dramatically over time, and features such as the rate of amplitude change at onsets (attack) and offsets (decay) signal critical information about the identity of speech sounds. Aging is also thought to be accompanied by increases in cortical excitability, which may differentially alter sensitivity to envelope dynamics. Here, we recorded electroencephalography in younger and older human adults (of both sexes) to investigate how aging affects neural synchronization to 4-Hz amplitude-modulated noises with different envelope shapes (ramped: slow attack & sharp decay; damped: sharp attack & slow decay). We observed that subcortical responses did not differ between age groups, whereas older compared to younger adults exhibited larger cortical responses to sound onsets, consistent with an increase in auditory cortical excitability. Neural activity in older adults synchronized more strongly with rapid-onset, slow-offset (damped) envelopes, was less sinusoidal, and more peaked. Younger adults demonstrated the opposite pattern, showing stronger synchronization with slow-onset, rapid-offset (ramped) envelopes, as well as a more sinusoidal neural response shape. The current results suggest that age-related changes in the excitability of auditory cortex alter responses to envelope dynamics. This may be part of the reason why older adults experience difficulty understanding speech in noise.\n\nSignificance StatementMany middle aged and older adults report difficulty understanding speech when there is background noise, which can trigger social withdrawal and negative psychosocial health outcomes. The difficulty may be related to age-related changes in how the brain processes temporal sound features. We tested younger and older people on their sensitivity to different envelope shapes, using EEG. Our results demonstrate that aging is associated with heightened sensitivity to sounds with a sharp attack and gradual decay, and sharper neural responses that deviate from the sinusoidal features of the stimulus, perhaps reflecting increased excitability in the aged auditory cortex. Altered responses to temporal sound features may be part of the reason why older adults often experience difficulty understanding speech in social situations.",

    "abstract": "While it is well understood that the brain experiences changes across short-term experience/learning and long-term development, it is unclear how these two mechanisms interact to produce developmental outcomes. Here we test an interactive model of learning and development where certain learning-related changes are constrained by developmental changes in the brain against an alternative development-as-practice model where outcomes are determined primarily by the accumulation of experience regardless of age. Participants (8-29 years) participated in a three-wave, accelerated longitudinal study during which they completed a feedback learning task during an fMRI scan. Adopting a novel longitudinal modeling approach, we probed the unique and moderated effects of learning, experience, and development simultaneously on behavioral performance and network modularity during the task. We found nonlinear patterns of development for both behavior and brain, and that greater experience supported increased learning and network modularity relative to naive subjects. We also found changing brain-behavior relationships across adolescent development, where heightened network modularity predicted improved learning, but only following the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. These results present compelling support for an interactive view of experience and development, where changes in the brain impact behavior in context-specific fashion based on developmental goals.",

    "abstract": "Regulating how fast to learn is critical for flexible behavior. Learning about the consequences of actions should be slow in stable environments, but accelerate when that environment changes. Recognizing stability and detecting change is difficult in environments with noisy relationships between actions and outcomes. Under these conditions, theories propose that uncertainty can be used to modulate learning rates (\"meta-learning\"). We show that mice behaving in a dynamic foraging task exhibit choice behavior that varied as a function of two forms of uncertainty estimated from a meta-learning model. The activity of dorsal raphe serotonin neurons tracked both types of uncertainty in the foraging task, as well as in a dynamic Pavlovian task. Reversible inhibition of serotonin neurons in the foraging task reproduced changes in learning predicted by a simulated lesion of meta-learning in the model. We thus provide a quantitative link between serotonin neuron activity, learning, and decision making.",
