    "abstract": "Many neuronal and retinal disorders are associated with pathological hyperpermeability of the microvasculature. We have used explants of rodent retinae to measure and manipulate acute neurovascular permeability and signal transduction to study the role of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Following stimulation with either vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) or bradykinin (BK), AMPK was rapidly and strongly phosphorylated and acted as a key mediator of permeability downstream of Ca2+ and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CAMKK). Accordingly, AMPK agonists potently induced acute retinal vascular leakage. AMPK activation led to phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which in turn increased VE-cadherin phosphorylation on Y685. In parallel, AMPK also mediated phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and HSP27, indicating that it regulated paracellular junctions and cellular contractility, both previously associated with endothelial permeability. Endothelial AMPK provided a missing link in neurovascular permeability, connecting Ca2+ transients to the activation of eNOS and p38, irrespective of the permeability-inducing factor used. Collectively, the ex-vivo retina model was easily accessible and, due to its compatibility with small molecule antagonists/agonists and siRNA, constitutes a reliable tool to study regulators and mechanism of neurovascular permeability.",

    "abstract": "During navigation, the visual responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are modulated by the animals spatial position. Here we show that this spatial modulation is similarly present across multiple higher visual areas but largely absent in the main thalamic pathway into V1. Similar to hippocampus, spatial modulation in visual cortex strengthens with experience and requires engagement in active behavior. Active navigation in a familiar environment, therefore, determines spatial modulation of visual signals starting in the cortex.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental gap in climate change vulnerability research is an understanding of the relative thermal sensitivity of ectotherms. Aquatic insects are vital to stream ecosystem function and biodiversity but insufficiently studied with respect to their thermal physiology. With global temperatures rising at an unprecedented rate, it is imperative that we know how aquatic insects respond to increasing temperature and whether these responses vary among taxa, latitudes, and elevations. We evaluated the thermal sensitivity of standard metabolic rate in stream-dwelling baetid mayflies and perlid stoneflies across a ~2,000 m elevation gradient in the temperate Rocky Mountains in Colorado, U.S.A., and the tropical Andes in Napo, Ecuador. We used temperature-controlled water baths and microrespirometry to estimate changes in oxygen consumption. Tropical mayflies generally exhibited greater thermal sensitivity in metabolism compared to temperate mayflies; tropical mayfly metabolic rates increased more rapidly with temperature and the insects more frequently exhibited behavioral signs of thermal stress. By contrast, temperate and tropical stoneflies did not clearly differ. Varied responses to temperature among baetid mayflies and perlid stoneflies may reflect differences in evolutionary history or ecological roles as herbivores and predators, respectively. Our results show that there is physiological variation across elevations and species and that low elevation tropical mayflies may be especially imperiled by climate warming. Given such variation among species, broad generalizations about the vulnerability of tropical ectotherms should be made more cautiously.",

Diagnosis of mitochondrial disease is hampered by the multicopy nature and potential heteroplasmy of the mitochondrial genome, differential distribution of mutant mtDNAs among various tissues, genetic interactions among alleles, and environmental effects. Here, we describe a new approach to the assessment of which mtDNA variants may be pathogenic. Our method takes advantage of site-specific conservation and variant acceptability metrics that minimize previous classification limitations. Using our novel features, we deploy machine learning to predict the pathogenicity of thousands of human mtDNA variants. Our work demonstrates that a substantial fraction of mtDNA changes not yet characterized as harmful are, in fact, likely to be deleterious.

    "abstract": "For decades, researchers have debated whether mental representations are symbolic or grounded in sensory inputs and motor programs. Certainly, aspects of mental representations are grounded. However, does the brain also contain abstract concept representations that mediate between perception and action in a flexible manner not tied to the details of sensory inputs and motor programs? Such conceptual pointers would be useful when concept remain constant despite changes in appearance and associated actions. We evaluated whether human participants acquire such representations using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Participants completed a probabilistic concept learning task in which sensory, motor, and category variables were not perfectly coupled nor entirely independent, making it possible to observe evidence for abstract representations or purely grounded representations. To assess how the learned concept structure is represented in the brain, we examined brain regions implicated in flexible cognition (e.g., prefrontal and parietal cortex) that are most likely to encode an abstract representation removed from sensory-motor details. We also examined sensory-motor regions that might encode grounded sensory-motor based representations tuned for categorization. Using a cognitive model to estimate participants category rule and multivariate pattern analysis of fMRI data, we found left prefrontal cortex and MT coded for category in absence of information coding for stimulus or response. Because category was based on the stimulus, finding an abstract representation of category was not inevitable. Our results suggest that certain brain areas support categorization behaviour by constructing concept representations in a format akin to a symbol that differs from stimulus-motor codes.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal is a key trait linking ecological and evolutionary dynamics, allowing organisms to optimize fitness expectations in spatially and temporally heterogeneous environments. Some organisms can either actively disperse or reduce activity in response to challenging conditions, and both responses may be under a trade-off. To understand how such organisms respond to changes in environmental conditions, we studied emigration (the first step of dispersal) and activity behaviour in the gonochoric land snail Pomatias elegans, a litter decomposer that can reach very high local densities, over most of the range of ecologically relevant densities. We found that crowding had no detectable effect on emigration tendency in this species, contrary to previous results in many hermaphroditic snails. Pomatias elegans is nonetheless able to detect population density; we show they reduce activity rather than increase dispersal in response to crowding. We propose that limiting activity may be more advantageous than moving away in species with especially poor movement abilities, even by land mollusc standards, like P. elegans. Interestingly, emigration and activity were positively correlated independently of density; this dispersal syndrome may reflect an underlying pace-of-life syndrome, and is compatible with a dispersal-dormancy trade-off, which would require further investigation. Additionally, we found snails with heavier shells relative to their size tended to be less mobile, which may reflect physical and metabolic constraints on movement and/or survival during inactivity. We finally discuss how the absence of density-dependent dispersal may explain why P. elegans is often found at very high local densities, and the possible consequences of this behaviour for ecosystem functioning and litter decomposition.",

We found that cultures with Lineage- SCA1+ KIT+ (LSK) cells on Ctsk deficient stromal cells display reduced colony formation and proliferation, with increased differentiation, giving rise to repopulating cells with reduced ability to repopulate the donor LSK and T cell compartments in the bone marrow. Subsequent in vivo experiments showed impairment of lymphocyte numbers, but, gross effects on early hematopoiesis or myelopoiesis were not found. Most consistently in in vivo experimental settings, we found a significant reduction of (donor) T cell numbers in the bone marrow. Lymphocyte deregulation is also found in transplantation experiments, which revealed that Ctsk is required for optimal regeneration not only of T cells, but also of B cells. Interestingly, cell non-autonomous Ctsk regulates both B- and T cell numbers, but T cell numbers in the bone marrow require an additional autonomous Ctsk-dependent process. Thus, we show that Ctsk is required for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells in vitro, but in vivo, Ctsk deficiency most strongly affects lymphocyte homeostasis, particularly of T cells in the bone marrow.",

    "abstract": "Photoconvertible fluorescent proteins (PCFPs) are widely used in super-resolution microscopy and studies of cellular dynamics. However, our understanding of their photophysics is still limited, hampering their quantitative application. For example, we do not know the optimal sample preparation methods or imaging conditions to count protein molecules fused to PCFPs by single-molecule localization microscopy in live and fixed cells. We also do not know how the behavior of PCFPs in live cells compares with fixed cells. Therefore, we investigated how formaldehyde fixation influences the photophysical properties of the popular green-to-red PCFP mEos3.2 in fission yeast cells under a wide range of imaging conditions. We estimated photophysical parameters by fitting a 3-state model of photoconversion and photobleaching to the time course of fluorescence signal per yeast cell expressing mEos3.2. We discovered that formaldehyde fixation makes the fluorescence signal, photoconversion rate and photobleaching rate of mEos3.2 sensitive to the buffer conditions by permeabilizing the yeast cell membrane. Under some imaging conditions, the time-integrated mEos3.2 signal per yeast cell is similar in live cells and fixed cells imaged in buffer at pH 8.5 with 1 mM DTT, indicating that light chemical fixation does not destroy mEos3.2 molecules. We also discovered that some red-state mEos3.2 molecules entered an intermediate dark state that is converted back to the red fluorescent state by 561-nm illumination. Our findings provide a guide to compare quantitatively conditions for imaging and counting of mEos3.2-tagged molecules in yeast cells. Our imaging assay and mathematical model are easy to implement and provide a simple quantitative approach to measure the time-integrated signal and the photoconversion and photobleaching rates of fluorescent proteins in cells.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEMaking quantitative measurements with single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) has been impeded by limited understanding of the photophysics of the fluorophores, which is very sensitive to the sample preparation and imaging conditions. We characterized the photophysics of the green-to-red photoconvertible fluorescent protein mEos3.2, which is widely used in SMLM. We combined quantitative fluorescence microscopy and mathematical modeling to measure the fluorescence signal and rate constants for photoconversion and photobleaching of mEos3.2 in live and fixed cells under a wide range of illumination intensities. Our findings provide a guide to compare conditions for imaging and counting mEos3.2-tagged proteins in cells. The presented approach is generally applicable to characterize other fluorescent proteins or dyes in cells.",

Parameter sensitivity analyses on the digital twin revealed that the main parameters determining the encapsulated growth configuration are different from those driving growth in free condition, confirming that radically different phenomena are at play. Results reported in this contribution support the idea that multiphase reactive poro-mechanics is an exceptional theoretical framework to attain an in-depth understanding of CCT experiments, to confirm their hypotheses and to further improve their design.",

    "abstract": "Airway mucociliary clearance (MCC) is required for host defense and often diminished in chronic lung diseases. Effective clearance depends upon coordinated actions of the airway epithelium and a mobile mucus layer. Dysregulation of the primary secreted airway mucin proteins, MUC5B and MUC5AC, is associated with a reduction in the rate of MCC; however, how other secreted proteins impact the integrity of the mucus layer and MCC remains unclear. We previously identified the gene Bpifb1/Lplunc1 as a regulator of airway MUC5B levels using genetic approaches. Here, we show that BPIFB1 is required for normal mucociliary clearance in vivo using Bpifb1 knockout (KO) mice. Reduced MCC in Bpifb1 KO mice occurred in the absence of defects in sodium or chloride ion transport or reduced ciliary beat frequency. BPIFB1 loss resulted in airway mucus flakes with significantly increased complex viscosity, a key biophysical property of mucus known to impact MCC. Finally, we detected colocalization of BPIFB1 and MUC5B in secretory granules in mice and in the protein mesh of secreted mucus in human airway cultures. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that BPIFB1 is an important component of the mucociliary apparatus in mice and a key component of the mucus protein network.",

We reconstruct mitochondria, Golgi apparati, centrioles, insulin secretory granules and micro-tubules of seven beta cells, and generate a comprehensive spatial map of microtubule-organelle interactions. We find that micro-tubules form non-radial networks that are predominantly not connected to either centrioles or endomembranes. Microtubule number and length, but not microtubule polymer density, vary with glucose stimulation. Furthermore, insulin secretory granules are enriched near the plasma membrane where they associate with microtubules. In summary, we provide the first 3D reconstructions of complete microtubule networks in primary mammalian cells together with evidence regarding their importance for insulin secretory granule positioning and thus supportive role in insulin secretion.",

With the Multiplane Mesoscope, we recorded excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations simultaneously across two cortical areas and multiple cortical layers in behaving mice. In the context of a visual detection of change task, we used this novel platform to study cortical areas interactions and quantified the cell-type specific distribution of neuronal correlations across a set of visual areas and layers.

    "abstract": "Several knowledgebases, such as CIViC and OncoKB, have been manually curated to support clinical interpretations of a limited number of \"hotspot\" somatic mutations in cancer, yet discrepancies or even conflicting interpretations have been observed among these knowledgebases. Additionally, while these knowledgebases have been extremely useful, they typically cannot interpret novel mutations, which may also have functional and clinical impacts in cancer. To address these challenges, we developed an automated interpretation tool called CancerVar (Cancer Variants interpretation) to score more than 12.9 million somatic mutations and classify them into four tiers: strong clinical significance, potential clinical significance, uncertain clinical significance, and benign/likely benign, based on the AMP/ASCO/CAP 2017 guideline. Considering that the AMP/ASCO/CAP rule-based scoring system may have inherent limitations, such as lack of a clear guidance on weighing different pieces of functional evidence or unclear definition for certain clinical evidence, it may cause misinterpretation for certain variants that have functional impacts but no proven clinical significance. To address this issue, we further introduced a deep learning-based scoring system to predict oncogenicity of mutations by semi-supervised generative adversarial network (SGAN) method using both functional and clinical evidence. We trained and validated the SGAN model on 5,234 somatic mutations from an in-house database of clinical reports on cancer patients, and achieved a good performance when testing on 6,226 variants that were curated by us through literature search. We also compared the prediction with several independent datasets and showed great utility in classifying variants with previously unknown interpretations. CancerVar is also incorporated into a web server that can generate automated texts with summarized descriptive interpretations, such as diagnostic, prognostic, targeted drug responses and clinical trial information for many hotspot mutations. In summary, CancerVar can facilitate clinical interpretation and hypothesis generation for somatic mutations, and greatly reduce manual workload for retrieving relevant evidence and implementing existing guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Genetic alterations that drive clonal expansions in ostensibly healthy tissues have implications for cancer risk. However, the total rate at which clonal expansions occur in healthy tissues remains unknown. Synonymous passenger mutations that hitchhike to high variant allele frequency due to a linked driver mutation can be used to estimate the total rate of positive selection across the genome. Because these synonymous hitchhikers are influenced by all mutations under selection, regardless of type or location, they can be used to estimate how many driver mutations are missed by narrow gene-focused sequencing panels. Here we analyse the variant allele frequency spectrum of synonymous passenger mutations to estimate the total rate at which mutations driving clonal expansions occur in healthy tissues. By applying our framework to data from physiologically healthy blood, we find that a large fraction of mutations driving clonal expansions occur outside of canonical cancer driver genes. In contrast, analysis of data from healthy oesophagus reveals little evidence for many driver mutations outside of those in NOTCH1 and TP53. Our framework, which generalizes to other tissues, sheds light on the fraction of drivers mutations that remain undiscovered and has implications for cancer risk prediction.",

    "abstract": "The exchange of metabolites among different bacterial genotypes profoundly impacts the structure and function of microbial communities. However, the factors governing the establishment of these cross-feeding interactions remain poorly understood. While shared physiological features may facilitate interactions among more closely related individuals, a lower relatedness should reduce competition and thus increase the potential for synergistic interactions. Here we investigate how the relationship between a metabolite donor and recipient affects the propensity of strains to engage in unidirectional cross-feeding interactions. For this, we performed pairwise cocultivation experiments between four auxotrophic recipients and 25 species of potential amino acid donors. Auxotrophic recipients grew in the vast majority of pairs tested (78%), suggesting metabolic cross-feeding interactions are readily established. Strikingly, both the phylogenetic distance between donor and recipient and the dissimilarity of their metabolic networks were positively associated with the growth of auxotrophic recipients. Analysing the co-growth of species from a gut microbial community in-silico also revealed that recipient genotypes benefitted more from interacting with metabolically dissimilar partners, thus corroborating the empirical results. Together, our work identifies the metabolic dissimilarity between bacterial genotypes as key factor determining the establishment of metabolic cross-feeding interactions in microbial communities.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe exchange of essential metabolites is common in microbial communities\nC_LIO_LIMetabolic cross-feeding interactions readily establish between auxotrophic and prototrophic bacterial strains\nC_LIO_LIBoth the phylogenetic and the metabolic dissimilarity between donors and recipients determines the successful establishment of metabolic cross-feeding interactions\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Extracting stem-loop sequences (hairpins) from genome-wide data is very important nowadays for some data mining tasks in bioinformatics. The genome preprocessing is very important because it has a strong influence on the later steps and the final results. For example, for novel miRNA prediction, all well-known hairpins must be properly located. Although there are some scripts that can be adapted and put together to achieve this task, they are outdated, none of them guarantees finding correspondence to well-known structures in the genome under analysis, and they do not take advantage of the latest advances in secondary structure prediction. We present here an R package for automatic extraction of hairpins from genome-wide data (HextractorR). HextractoR makes an exhaustive and smart analysis of the genome in order to obtain a very good set of short sequences for further processing. Moreover, genomes can be processed in parallel and with low memory requirements. Results obtained showed that HextractoR has effectively outperformed other methods.\n\nHextractoR it is freely available at CRAN and Sourceforge.",

Venetoclax is a promising new therapy approved for use in combination with a hypomethylating agent or with low dose cytarabine for the treatment of newly diagnosed older AML patients or those ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. 225Actinium-lintuzumab (225Ac-lintuzumab) is a clinical stage radioimmunotherapy targeting CD33 that has shown evidence of single agent activity in relapsed/refractory AML. Increased expression of MCL-1 is a mediator of resistance to venetoclax in cancer.\n\nExperimental designHere we investigated the potential for 225Ac-lintuzumab-directed DNA damage to suppress MCL-1 levels as a possible mechanism of reversing resistance to venetoclax in two preclinical in vivo models of AML.\n\nResultsWe demonstrated that 225Ac-lintuzumab in combination with venetoclax induced a synergistic increase in tumor cell killing compared to treatment with either drug alone in venetoclax-resistant AML cell lines through both an induction of double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) and depletion of MCL-1 protein levels. Further, this combination led to significant tumor growth control and prolonged survival benefit in venetoclax-resistant in vivo AML models.\n\nConclusionsThere results suggest that the combination of 225Ac-lintuzumab with venetoclax may be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of patients with venetoclax-resistant AML.",

    "abstract": "Although the adverse impacts of ocean acidification (OA) on marine calcifiers have been investigated substantially, the anti-stress abilities regulated by increased light availability are unclear. Herein, the interactive effects of three light levels combined with two pCO2 concentrations on the physiological acclimation of the calcifying macroalga Halimeda opuntia were investigated using a pCO2-light coupling experiment. The results indicate that OA exhibits an adverse role in influencing algal growth, calcification, photosynthesis and other physiological performances in H. opuntia. The relative growth rate in elevated pCO2 significantly declined by 13.14%-41.29%, while net calcification rates decreased by nearly three-fold under OA. Notably, increased light availability could enhance stress resistance by the accumulation of soluble organic molecules, especially soluble carbohydrate, soluble protein and free amino acids, and in combination with metabolic enzyme-driven activities alleviated OA stress. Carotenoid content in low light conditions accumulated remarkably and rapid light curves for relative electron transport rate was significantly enhanced by increasing light intensities, indicating that this new organization of the photosynthetic machinery in H. opuntia accommodated light variations and elevated pCO2 conditions. Taken together, the results describe stress resistance by the enhancement of metabolic performance in marine calcifiers to mitigate OA stress.\n\nOne sentence summaryIncreased light availability enhances stress resistance in Halimeda opuntia by the accumulation of soluble organic molecules and enzyme-driven activities to alleviate ocean acidification stress.\n\nCredit authorship contribution statementFangfang Yang and Lijuan Long conceived and designed the experiments.

Here, we propose a mechanistic framework of cognitive variability in older adults, linking the influence of white matter microstructure on fast and effective communications between brain regions. Using diffusion tensor imaging and electroencephalography, we show that individual differences in white matter network organization are associated with network clustering and efficiency in the alpha and high-gamma bands, and that functional network dynamics partly explain individual cognitive control performance in older adults. We show that older individuals with high versus low structural network clustering differ in task-related network dynamics and cognitive performance. These findings were corroborated by investigating magnetoencephalography networks in an independent dataset. This multimodal brain connectivity framework of individual differences provides a holistic account of how differences in white matter microstructure underlie age-related variability in dynamic network organization and cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "The ability to optically record dynamics of neuronal membrane potential promises to revolutionize our understanding of neurobiology. In this study, we show that the far-red voltage sensitive fluorophore, Berkeley Red Sensor of Transmembrane potential -1, or BeRST 1, can be used to monitor neuronal membrane potential changes across dozens of neurons at a sampling rate of 500 Hz. Notably, voltage imaging with BeRST 1 can be implemented with affordable, commercially available illumination sources, optics, and detectors. BeRST 1 is well-tolerated in cultures of rat hippocampal neurons and provides exceptional optical recording fidelity, as judged by dual fluorescence imaging and patch-clamp electrophysiology. We developed a semi-automated spike-picking program to reduce user bias when calling action potentials and used this in conjunction with BeRST 1 to develop an optical spike and connectivity analysis workflow (OSCA) for high-throughput dissection of neuronal activity dynamics in development and disease. The high temporal resolution of BeRST 1 enables dissection of firing rate changes in response to acute, pharmacological interventions with commonly used inhibitors like gabazine and picrotoxin. Over longer periods of time, BeRST 1 also tracks chronic perturbations to neurons exposed to amyloid beta (A{beta}1-42), revealing modest changes to spiking frequency but profound changes to overall network connectivity. Finally, we use OSCA to track changes in neuronal connectivity during development, providing a functional readout of network assembly. We envision that use of BeRST 1 and OSCA described here will be of use to the broad neuroscience community.\n\nSignificance StatementOptical methods to visualize membrane potential dynamics provide a powerful complement to Ca2+ imaging, patch clamp electrophysiology, and multi-electrode array recordings. However, modern voltage imaging strategies often require complicated optics, custom-built microscopes, or genetic manipulations that are impractical outside of a subset of model organisms. Here, we describe the use of Berkeley Red Sensor of Transmembrane potential, or BeRST 1, a far-red voltage-sensitive fluorophore that can directly visualize membrane potential changes with millisecond resolution across dozens of neurons. Using only commercially available components, voltage imaging with BeRST 1 reveals profound changes in neuronal connectivity during development, exposes changes to firing rate during acute pharmacological perturbation, and illuminates substantial increases in network connectivity in response to chronic exposure to amyloid beta.",

    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) develops until early adulthood in rodents and humans, but how synaptic plasticity evolves throughout postnatal development is not known. Here, we used a cross-sectional approach to establish the postnatal maturational trajectories of intrinsic properties and synaptic plasticity in the PFC of rats of both sexes. We found that while layer 5 PFC pyramidal neurons from rats of both sexes displayed similar current-voltage relationships, rheobases and resting potentials across all age groups, excitability was lower in female adults compared to the other developmental stages. NMDAR-dependent long-term potentiation and mGluR2/3-mediated long-term depression (LTD) were equally expressed at the juvenile, pubescent and adult developmental stages in animals of both sexes. However, the developmental course of endocannabinoid (eCB)-mediated LTD was sexually dimorphic. First, eCB-LTD emerged during the juvenile period in females. However, although CB1Rs were functional in both sexes at all developmental stages, eCB-LTDs first emerged during pubescence in male. Second, eCB-LTD engaged distinct receptors in males and females depending on their developmental stages. Female rats employ both CB1R and TRPV1R to produce eCB-LTD at the juvenile stage but solely CB1R at pubescence followed by only TRPV1R at adulthood. In contrast, in pubescent and adult males eCB-LTD always and exclusively depended on CB1R. Pharmacological blockade of 2AGs principal degrading enzyme allowed incompetent male juvenile synapses to express eCB-LTD. The data reveal different maturational trajectories in the PFC of male and female rats and provide new cellular substrates to the sex-specific behavioral and synaptic abnormalities caused by adolescent exposure to cannabinoids.",

In particular, they need to account for the efficacy of their performance - the degree to which rewards are determined by performance or by independent factors. Yet it remains unclear how people learn about their performance efficacy in an environment. Here we combined computational modeling with measures of task performance and EEG, to provide a mechanistic account of how people (a) learn and update efficacy expectations in a changing environment, and (b) proactively adjust control allocation based on current efficacy expectations. Across two studies subjects performed an incentivized cognitive control task while their performance efficacy (the likelihood that rewards are performance- contingent or random) varied over time. We show that people update their efficacy beliefs based on prediction errors - leveraging similar neural and computational substrates as those that underpin reward learning - and adjust how much control they allocate according to these beliefs. Using computational modeling, we show that these control adjustments reflect changes in information processing, rather than the speed-accuracy tradeoff. These findings demonstrate the neurocomputational mechanism through which people learn how worthwhile their cognitive control is.",

    "abstract": "To estimate microstructure-related parameters from diffusion MRI data, biophysical models make strong, simplifying assumptions about the underlying tissue. The extent to which many of these assumptions are valid remains an open research question. This study was inspired by the disparity between the estimated intra-axonal axial diffusivity from literature and that typically assumed by the Neurite Orientation Dispersion and Density Imaging (NODDI) model (d[boxV] = 1.7m2/ms). We first demonstrate how changing the assumed axial diffusivity results in considerably different NODDI parameter estimates. Second, we illustrate the ability to estimate axial diffusivity as a free parameter of the model using high b-value data and an adapted NODDI framework. Using both simulated and in vivo data we investigate the impact of fitting to either real-valued or magnitude data, with Gaussian and Rician noise characteristics respectively, and what happens if we get the noise assumptions wrong in this high b-value and thus low SNR regime. Our results from real-valued human data estimate intra-axonal axial diffusivities of ~ 2 - 2.5m2/ms, in line with current literature. Crucially, our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for both a rectified noise floor and/or a signal offset to avoid biased parameter estimates when dealing with low SNR data.",

    "abstract": "Aedes (Ae.) aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes transmit arthropod-borne diseases around the globe, causing ~700,000 deaths each year. Genetic mutants are valuable tools to interrogate both fundamental vector biology and mosquito host factors important for viral infection. However, very few genetic mutants have been described in mosquitoes in comparison to model organisms. The relative ease of applying CRISPR/Cas9 based gene editing has transformed genome engineering and has rapidly increased the number of available gene mutants in mosquitoes. Yet, in vivo studies may not be practical for screening large sets of mutants or possible for laboratories that lack insectaries. Thus, it would be useful to adapt CRISPR/Cas9 systems to common mosquito cell lines. In this study, we generated and characterized a mosquito optimized, plasmid based CRISPR/Cas9 system for use in U4.4 (Ae. albopictus) and Aag2 (Ae. aegypti) cell lines. We demonstrated highly efficient editing of the AGO1 locus and isolated knock-down AGO1 cell lines. Further, we used homology-directed repair to establish knock-in Aag2 cell lines with a 3xFLAG-tag at the N-terminus of endogenous AGO1. These experimentally verified plasmids are versatile, cost-effective, and efficiently edit immune competent mosquito cell lines that are widely used in arbovirus studies.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how promoters work in non-host cells is complex. Nonetheless, understanding this process is crucial while performing gene expression modulation studies. In this study, inhibitory regions in the 5 end of the OpIE2 insect viral promoter were found to be blocking the activity of the CMV promoter in mammalian cells. This finding was reached in the process of constructing a shuttle vector with CMV and OpIE2 promoters in a tandem arrangement to achieve gene expression in both mammalian and insect cells, respectively. OpIE2 promoter was cloned downstream of the CMV promoter and upstream of the EGFP reporter gene. After introducing the constructed shuttle vector to insect and mammalian cells, a significant drop in the CMV promoter activity in mammalian cells was observed. To enhance the CMV promoter activity, several modification were made to the shuttle vector including site-directed mutagenesis to remove all ATG codons from the downstream promoter (OpIE2), separating the two promoters to eliminate the effect of transcription interference between them, and finally, identifying some inhibitory regions in the OpIE2 promoter sequence. When these inhibitory regions were removed, high expression levels in insect and mammalian cells were restored. In conclusion, a shuttle vector was constructed that works efficiently in both mammalian and insect cell lines. This study showed that inserting 261 to 313 bp from the 3 end of the OpIE2 promoter downstream of the CMV promoter maintains efficient gene expression in both Sf9 and mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "Flaviviruses pose a constant threat to human health. These RNA viruses are transmitted by the bite of infected mosquitoes and ticks and regularly cause outbreaks. To identify host factors required for flavivirus infection we performed full-genome loss of function CRISPR-Cas9 screens. Based on these results we focused our efforts on characterizing the roles that TMEM41B and VMP1 play in the virus replication cycle. Our mechanistic studies on TMEM41B revealed that all members of the Flaviviridae family that we tested require TMEM41B. We tested 12 additional virus families and found that SARS-CoV-2 of the Coronaviridae also required TMEM41B for infection. Remarkably, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present at nearly twenty percent in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection. Based on our mechanistic studies we hypothesize that TMEM41B is recruited to flavivirus RNA replication complexes to facilitate membrane curvature, which creates a protected environment for viral genome replication.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSTMEM41B and VMP1 are required for both autophagy and flavivirus infection, however, autophagy is not required for flavivirus infection.\n\nTMEM41B associates with viral proteins and likely facilitates membrane remodeling to establish viral RNA replication complexes.\n\nTMEM41B single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) present at nearly twenty percent in East Asian populations reduce flavivirus infection.\n\nTMEM41B-deficient cells display an exaggerated innate immune response upon high multiplicity flavivirus infection.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) causes ocular and orofacial infections, which are generally well controlled by the host and nonlethal. In rare cases, HSV-1 causes encephalitis, which leads to permanent brain injuries, memory loss or even death. Host factors protect the organism from viral infections by activating the immune response. However, the factors that confer neuroprotection during viral encephalitis are unknown. Here we show that mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is essential for the host survival of ocular HSV-1 infections in vivo. We found that the loss of mTORC2 causes systemic HSV-1 infection not only because of weak innate and adaptive immune responses but also due to increased ocular and neuronal cell death, which becomes lethal over time. Furthermore, we found that mTORC2 mediates cell survival channels through the inactivation of the proapoptotic factor FoxO3a. Our results demonstrate how mTORC2 potentiates host defenses against viral infections as well as implicating mTORC2 as a necessary host factor for survival. We anticipate our findings may help develop new therapeutic window for severe HSV-1 infections, such as herpes simplex encephalitis.",

    "abstract": "Systemic hypoxia is a common element in most perinatal emergencies and is a known driver of Bnip3 expression in the neonatal heart. Bnip3 plays a prominent role in the evolution of necrotic cell death, disrupting ER calcium homeostasis and initiating mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Emerging evidence suggests a cardioprotective role for the prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol during periods of hypoxia, but the mechanisms for this protection are not completely understood. Using a combination of mouse and cell models, we tested if misoprostol is cardioprotective during neonatal hypoxic injury by altering Bnip3 function. Here we report that hypoxia elicits mitochondrial-fragmentation, MPT, reduced ejection fraction, and evidence of necroinflammation, which were abrogated with misoprostol treatment or Bnip3 knockout. Through molecular studies we show that misoprostol leads to PKA-dependent Bnip3 phosphorylation at threonine-181, and subsequent redistribution of Bnip3 from mitochondrial Opa1 and the ER through an interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Taken together, our results demonstrate a role for Bnip3 phosphorylation in the regulation of cardiomyocyte contractile/metabolic dysfunction, and necroinflammation. Furthermore, we identify a potential pharmacological mechanism to prevent neonatal hypoxic injury.",

    "abstract": "Macromolecular transport across the nuclear envelope depends on facilitated diffusion through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The interior of NPCs contains a permeability barrier made of phenylalanine-glycine (FG) repeat domains that selectively facilitates the permeation of cargoes bound to nuclear transport receptors (NTRs). FG repeats in NPC are a major site of O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification, but the functional role of this modification in nucleocytoplasmic transport is unclear. We developed high-throughput assays based on optogenetic probes to quantify the kinetics of nuclear import and export in living human cells. We found that increasing O-GlcNAc modification of the NPC accelerated NTR-facilitated nucleocytoplasmic transport of proteins in both directions, and decreasing modification slowed transport. Super-resolution imaging revealed strong enrichment of O-GlcNAc at the FG-repeat barrier. O-GlcNAc modification also accelerated passive permeation of a small, inert protein through NPCs. We conclude that O-GlcNAc modification accelerates nucleocytoplasmic transport by enhancing the non-specific permeability the FG-repeat barrier, perhaps by steric inhibition of interactions between FG repeats.\n\nSummaryNuclear pore complexes mediate nuclear transport and are highly modified with O-linked N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) on FG repeat domains. Using a new quantitative live-cell imaging assay, Yoo and Mitchison demonstrate acceleration of nuclear import and export by O-GlcNAc modification.",

    "abstract": "Unicellular eukaryotic predators have a crucial role in the functioning of the ocean ecosystem by recycling nutrients and energy that are channeled to upper trophic levels. Traditionally, these evolutionary-diverse organisms have been combined into a single functional group (Heterotrophic flagellates), overlooking their organismal differences. Here we investigate four evolutionary related species belonging to one cosmopolitan family of uncultured marine picoeukaryotic predators: MAST-4 (species A, B, C, and E). Co-occurrence and distribution analyses in the global surface ocean indicated contrasting patterns in MAST-4A & C, suggesting adaptation to different temperatures. We then investigated whether these spatial distribution patterns were mirrored by MAST-4 genomic content using Single-Cell Genomics. Analyses of 69 single-cells recovered 66-83% of the MAST-4A/B/C/E genomes, which displayed substantial inter-species divergence. MAST-4 genomes were similar in terms of broad gene functional categories, but they differed in enzymes of ecological relevance, such as glycoside hydrolases (GHs), which are part of the food degradation machinery in MAST-4. Interestingly, MAST-4 species featuring a similar GH composition co-excluded each other (A & C) in the surface global ocean, while species with a different set of GHs appeared to be able to co-exist (species B & C) suggesting further niche diversification associated to prey digestion. We propose that differential niche adaptation to temperature and prey type has promoted adaptive evolutionary diversification in MAST-4. Altogether, we show that minute ocean predators from the same family may have different biogeography and genomic content, which need to be accounted to better comprehend marine food webs.",

    "abstract": "Puddle frogs of the Phrynobatrachus steindachneri species complex are a useful group for investigating speciation and phylogeography in Afromontane forests of the Cameroon Highlands (Cameroon Volcanic Line) in western Central Africa. The species complex is represented by six morphologically relatively cryptic mitochondrial DNA lineages, with only two of them distinguished at the species level - southern P. jimzimkusi and Lake Oku endemic P. njiomock, leaving the remaining four lineages with a pooled identification as  P. steindachneri. In this study, the six mtDNA lineages are subjected to genomic sequence capture analyses to delimit species (together with morphology) and to study biogeography. Nuclear DNA data (387 loci; 571,936 aligned base pairs) distinguished all six mtDNA lineages, but the splitting pattern and depths of divergences supported only four main clades--besides P. jimzimkusi and P. njiomock, only two from the four  P. steindachneri mtDNA lineages. One is here described as a new species, P. sp. nov. Reticulate evolution (hybridization) was detected within the species complex with morphologically intermediate hybrid individuals placed between the parental species in phylogenomic analyses, forming a phylogenetic artefact - a ladder-like tree pattern. The presence of hybrids is undesirable in standard phylogenetic analyses, but is essential and beneficial in the network multispecies coalescent. This latter approach allowed us an insight into the reticulate evolutionary history of these endemic frogs. Introgressions likely occurred during the Middle and Late Pleistocene climatic oscillations, due to the cyclic connections (likely dominating during cold glacials) and separations (warm interglacials) of montane forests. The genomic phylogeographic pattern supports the earliest division between southern (Mt. Manengouba to Mt. Oku) and northern mountains at the onset of the Pleistocene. Further subdivisions occurred in the Early Pleistocene separating populations from the northernmost (Tchabal Mbabo, Gotel Mts.) and middle mountains (Mt. Mbam, Mt. Oku, Mambilla Plateau), as well as the microendemic lineage restricted to Lake Oku (Mt. Oku). Mount Oku harboring three species is of particular conservation importance. This unique model system is highly threatened as all the species within the complex have exhibited severe population declines in the past decade, placing them on the brink of extinction. We therefore urge for conservation actions in the Cameroon Highlands to preserve their diversity before it is too late.",

However, due to the lack of analysis tools, methods designed for binary and quantitative traits have often been used inappropriately to analyze categorical phenotypes, which produces inflated type I error rates or is less powerful. To accurately model the dependence of an ordinal categorical phenotype on covariates, we propose an efficient mixed model association test, Proportional Odds Logistic Mixed Model (POLMM). POLMM is demonstrated to be computationally efficient to analyze large datasets with hundreds of thousands of genetic related samples, can control type I error rates at a stringent significance level regardless of the phenotypic distribution, and is more powerful than other alternative methods. We applied POLMM to 258 ordinal categorical phenotypes on array-genotypes and imputed samples from 408,961 individuals in UK Biobank.

The mean h2EWAS was zero, with evidence for regular cigarette smoking exhibiting the largest association with all markers (h2EWAS=0.42) and the only one surpassing a false discovery rate < 0.1. Though underpowered to determine the h2EWAS value for any one trait, h2EWAS was predictive of the number of EWAS hits across the traits analysed (AUC=0.7). Modelling the contributions of the methylome on a per-site versus a per-region basis gave varied h2EWAS estimates (r=0.47) but neither approach obtained substantially higher model fits across all traits. Our analysis indicates that most complex traits do not heavily associate with markers commonly measured in EWAS within blood. However, it is likely DNA methylation does capture variation in some traits and h2EWAS may be a reasonable way to prioritise traits that are likely to yield associations.",

    "abstract": "Chia (Salvia hispanica L.), now a popular superfood, is one of the richest sources of dietary nutrients such as protein, fiber, and polyunsaturated fatty acids. At present, the genomic and genetic information available in the public domain for this crop is scanty, which hinders understanding its growth and developmental processes and impedes genetic improvement through genomics-assisted methods. We report RNA-seq based comprehensive transcriptome atlas of Chia across 13 different tissue types covering vegetative and reproductive growth stages. We generated [~]394 million raw reads from transcriptome sequencing, of which [~]355 million high-quality reads were used to generate de novo reference transcriptome assembly and the tissue-specific transcript assemblies. After quality assessment of merged assemblies and using redundancy reduction methods, 82,663 reference transcripts were identified. Of these, 53,200 transcripts show differential expression in at least one sample and provide information on spatio-temporal modulation of gene expression in Chia. We identified genes involved in the biosynthesis of omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and various terpenoid compounds. The study also led to the identification of 633 differentially expressed transcription factors from 53 gene families. The coexpression analysis suggested that members of the B3, bZIP, ERF, WOX, AP2, MYB, C3H, EIL, LBD, DBB, Nin-like, and HSF transcription factor gene families play key roles in the regulation of target gene expression across various developmental stages. This study also identified 2,411 simple sequence repeat (SSRs) as potential genetic markers residing in the transcribed regions. The transcriptome atlas provides essential genomic resources for basic research, applications in plant breeding, and annotation of the Chia genome.",

Engineering gene expression in CHO is key to improving drug quality and affordability. However, engineering gene expression or activating silent genes requires accurate annotation of the underlying regulatory elements and transcription start sites (TSSs). Unfortunately, most TSSs in the Chinese hamster genome were computationally predicted and are frequently inaccurate. Here, we revised TSS annotations for 15,308 Chinese hamster genes and 4,478 non-coding RNAs based on experimental data from CHO-K1 cells and 10 hamster tissues. The experimental realignment and discovery of TSSs now expose previously hidden motifs, such as the TATA box. We further demonstrate, by targeting the glycosyltransferase gene Mgat3, how accurate annotations readily facilitate activating silent genes by CRISPRa to obtain more human-like glycosylation. Together, we envision our annotation and data will provide a rich resource for the CHO community, improve genome engineering efforts and aid comparative and evolutionary studies.",

    "abstract": "Although wastewater and sewage systems are known to be significant reservoirs of antibiotic resistant bacterial populations and periodic outbreaks of drug resistant infection, there is little quantitative understanding of the drivers behind resistant population growth in these settings. In order to fill this gap in quantitative understanding of the development of antibiotic resistant infections in wastewater, we have developed a mathematical model synthesizing many known drivers of antibiotic resistance in these settings to help predict the growth of resistant populations in different environmental scenarios. A number of these drivers of drug resistant infection outbreak including antibiotic residue concentration, antibiotic interaction, chromosomal mutation and horizontal gene transfer, have not previously been integrated into a single computational model. We validated the outputs of the model with quantitative studies conducted on the eVOLVER continuous culture platform. Our integrated model shows that low levels of antibiotic residues present in wastewater can lead to increased development of resistant populations, and the dominant mechanism of resistance acquisition in these populations is horizontal gene transfer rather than acquisition of chromosomal mutations. Additionally, we found that synergistic antibiotic interactions lead to increased resistant population growth. These findings, consistent with recent experimental and field studies, provide new quantitative knowledge on the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacterial reservoirs, and the model developed herein can be adapted for use as a prediction tool in public health policy making, particularly in low income settings where water sanitation issues remain widespread and disease outbreaks continue to undermine public health efforts.\n\nImportanceThe rate at which antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has developed and spread throughout the world has increased in recent years, and according to the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance in 2014 it is suggested that the current rate will lead several million people AMR-related deaths by 205025. One major reservoir of resistant bacterial populations that has been linked to outbreaks of drug resistant bacterial infections, but is not well understood, is in wastewater settings, where antibiotic pollution is often present. Using ordinary differential equations incorporating several known drivers of resistance in wastewater, we find that interactions between antibiotic residues and horizontal gene transfer significantly affect the growth of resistant bacterial reservoirs.",

    "abstract": "We explore a virtual experiment strategy to discover plausible mechanism-based explanations for frequently inaccurate predictions of hepatic drug clearance made using established in vitro-in vivo extrapolation methods. We describe a three-protocol plan that uses validated software analogs of real in vitro and in vivo systems constructed using a common set of objects, components, spaces, and methods. Both systems utilize identical quasi-autonomous hepatocyte analogs containing enzyme-like objects. We parameterize concrete mobile objects (virtual compounds) to simulate the referent drugs disposition and removal characteristics in vitro and in vivo. The goal of Protocol one (Protocol two) is that measures of virtual compound removal using the in vitro analog (in vivo analog) map directly to the measurements used to compute intrinsic clearance (in vivo hepatic clearance). Protocol three, the focus of this work, requires achieving an essential cross-system validation target. For a subset of virtual compounds, measurements of unbound compounds entering hepatocytes (and their subsequent removal) during virtual in vitro experiments will directly predict corresponding measures made during virtual in vivo experiments. We study four highly permeable virtual compounds when their unbound fraction is fixed at one of seven values (0.05-1.0). Results span the range of hepatic extraction ratios. We achieve the cross-system validation target in 15 cases. In the other 13 cases, explanations of the in vitro-in vivo differences in disposition and removal trace to differences in compound-hepatocyte access within the two analogs during execution. The hepato-mimetic structural organization of hepatocytes within the in vivo analog, which is absent within the in vitro analog, is the determining factor. The results taken together support the feasibility of using the three-protocol plan to help explain observed in vitro-in vivo extrapolation discrepancies. We conjecture that, for some cases, the model mechanism-based explanations of discrepancies described herein will have wet-lab counterparts.",

    "abstract": "In the last few decades, application of DNA microarray technology has sprung up as a powerful technique for discovering stage specific changes in expression pattern of a disease progression. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) which is one of the most devastating diseases affecting humankind. Here, we have proposed a framework to examine the difference among microarray gene expression data of uninfected and three different HIV-1 infection stages using module preservation statistics. Initially, we detected differentially expressed genes among all the stages and identified coexpression modules by using topological overlap as a dissimilarity measure. To examine relationship among co-expression modules, we have compiled a module eigenegene network for each sample category which models similarity among all coexpression modules. To further examine the network, we have found clusters in it which are termed as  meta-modules. Different module preservation statistics with two composite statistics: \"Zsummary\" and \"MedianRank\" are utilized to examine changes in structure of coexpression modules. We have applied our proposed methodology to discover modular changes between uninfected and acute samples, acute and chronic samples, chronic and AIDS samples. We have found several interesting results on preservation characteristics of gene modules across different stages. Some genes are identified to be preserved in a pair of stages while alter their characteristics across other stages. We further validated the obtained results using permutation test and classification techniques. Biological significance of the obtained modules have been examined using gene ontology and pathway based analysis. Additionally, we have detected key immune regulatory hub genes in the associated protein-protein interaction networks (PPINs) of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using twelve topological and centrality analysis methods. Moreover, we have analyzed the key immune regulatory genes which interacts with HIV-1 proteins inside the preserved and perturbed meta-modules across different HIV-1 stages and thus likely to act as potential biomarkers in HIV-1 progression.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic options for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment have changed dramatically in recent years with the advent of novel immunotherapeutic approaches. Among these, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), using monoclonal antibodies, has shown tremendous promise in a small proportion of patients. In order to better predict patients that will respond to ICB treatment, biomarkers such as tumor-associated CD8+ T cell frequency, tumor checkpoint protein status and mutational burden have been utilized, however, with mixed success. In this study, we hypothesized that significantly altering the suppressive tumor immune landscape in NSCLC could potentially improve ICB efficacy. Using sub-therapeutic doses of our Salmonella typhimurium-based therapy targeting the suppressive molecule indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (shIDO-ST) in tumor-bearing mice, we observed dramatic changes in immune subset phenotypes that included increases in antigen presentation markers, decreased regulatory T cell frequency and overall reduced checkpoint protein expression. Combination shIDO-ST treatment with anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 antibodies enhanced tumor growth control, compared to either treatment alone, which was associated with a significant intratumoral influx of CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes. These results suggest that the success of ICB therapy may be more accurately predicted by taking into account multiple factors such as potential for antigen presentation and frequency of suppressive immune subsets in addition to markers already being considered. Alternatively, combination treatment with agents such as shIDO-ST could be used to create a more conducive tumor microenvironment for improving response rates to immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Voltage imaging with fluorescent dyes affords the opportunity to map neuronal activity in both time and space. One limitation to imaging is the inability to image complete neuronal networks: some fraction of cells remains outside of the observation window. Here, we combine voltage imaging, post hoc immunocytochemistry, and patterned microisland hippocampal culture to provide imaging of complete neuronal networks. The patterned microislands completely fill the field of view of our high-speed (500 Hz) camera, enabling reconstruction of the spiking patterns of every single neuron in the network. Cultures raised on microislands develop similarly to neurons grown on coverslips and display similar composition of inhibitory and excitatory cell types. The principal excitatory cell types (CA1, CA3, and dentate granule cells, or DGC) are also present in similar proportions in both preparations. We calculate the likelihood that action potential firing in one neuron to trigger action potential firing in a downstream neuron in a spontaneously active network to construct a functional connection map of these neuronal ensembles. Importantly, this functional map indicates preferential connectivity between DGC and CA3 neurons and between CA3 and CA1 neurons, mimicking the neuronal circuitry of the intact hippocampus. We envision that patterned microislands, in combination with voltage imaging and methods to classify cell types, will be a powerful method for exploring neuronal function in both healthy and disease states. Additionally, because the entire neuronal network is sampled simultaneously, this strategy has the power to go further, revealing all functional connections between all cell types.\n\nSignificance StatementIn vitro model systems provide unsurpassed control and access for exploring the molecular and cellular details of neurobiology. We developed a patterned microisland system for culturing rat hippocampal neurons that recapitulates the features of bulk hippocampal cultures, but with the added benefit of allowing access to high-speed imaging of entire neuronal ensembles using voltage imaging. By using far-red voltage-sensitive fluorophores, we map the functional connections across all cells in the neuronal ensemble, revealing that several important functional synapses present in the intact hippocampus are recapitulated in this microisland system. We envision the methods described here will be a powerful complement to ongoing research into basic neurobiological mechanisms and the search for therapies to treat diseases arising from their dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "The pattern of synaptic connections among neurons defines the circuit structure, which constrains the computations that a circuit can perform. The strength of synaptic connections is costly to measure yet important for accurate circuit modeling. It has been shown that synaptic surface area correlates with synaptic strength, yet in the emerging field of connectomics, most studies rely instead on the counts of synaptic contacts between two neurons. Here we quantified the relationship between synaptic count and synaptic area as measured from volume electron microscopy of the larval Drosophila central nervous system. We found that the total synaptic surface area, summed across all synaptic contacts from one presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic one, can be accurately predicted solely from the number of synaptic contacts, for a variety of neurotransmitters. Our findings support the use of synaptic counts for approximating synaptic strength when modeling neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing realization in neuroscience that information is represented in the brain, e.g., neocortex, hippocampus, in the form sparse distributed codes (SDCs), a kind of cell assembly. Two essential questions are: a) how are such codes formed on the basis of single trials, and how is similarity preserved during learning, i.e., how do more similar inputs get mapped to more similar SDCs. I describe a novel Modular Sparse Distributed Code (MSDC) that provides simple, neurally plausible answers to both questions. An MSDC coding field (CF) consists of Q WTA competitive modules (CMs), each comprised of K binary units (analogs of principal cells). The modular nature of the CF makes possible a single-trial, unsupervised learning algorithm that approximately preserves similarity and crucially, runs in fixed time, i.e., the number of steps needed to store an item remains constant as the number of stored items grows. Further, once items are stored as MSDCs in superposition and such that their intersection structure reflects input similarity, both fixed time best-match retrieval and fixed time belief update (updating the probabilities of all stored items) also become possible. The algorithms core principle is simply to add noise into the process of choosing a code, i.e., choosing a winner in each CM, which is proportional to the novelty of the input. This causes the expected intersection of the code for an input, X, with the code of each previously stored input, Y, to be proportional to the similarity of X and Y. Results demonstrating these capabilities for spatial patterns are given in the appendix.",

However, these structures, called gastruloids, currently lack the anterior embryonic regions, such as those belonging to the brain. Here we describe an approach to generate gastruloids that have a more complete antero-posterior development. We used bioengineered hydrogel microwell arrays to promote the robust derivation of mouse ESCs into post-implantation epiblast-like (EPI) aggregates in a reproducible and scalable manner. These EPI aggregates break symmetry and axially elongate without external chemical stimulation. Inhibition of WNT signaling in early stages of development leads to the formation of gastruloids with anterior neural tissues. Thus, we provide a new tool to study the development of the mouse after implantation in vitro, especially the formation of anterior neural regions.",

    "abstract": "Decision tree algorithms are rarely utilized in paleontological research, and here we show that machine learning algorithms can be used to identify determinants of extinction as well as predict extinction risk. This application of decision tree algorithms is important because the ecological selectivity of mass extinctions can reveal critical information on organismic traits as key determinants of extinction and hence the causes of extinction. To understand which factors led to the mass extinction of life during an extreme global warming event, we quantified the ecological selectivity of marine extinctions in the well-studied South China region during the end-Permian mass extinction using the categorized gradient boosting algorithm. We find that extinction selectivity varies between different groups of organisms and that a synergy of multiple environmental stressors best explains the overall end-Permian extinction selectivity pattern. Extinction risk was greater for genera that were limited to deep-water habitats, had a stationary mode of life, possessed a siliceous skeleton or, less critically, had calcitic skeletons. These selective losses directly link the extinction to the environmental effects of rapid injections of carbon dioxide into the ocean-atmosphere system, specifically the combined effects of expanded oxygen minimum zones, rapid warming, and ocean acidification.",

To investigate the consequences of long-term adaptation, we evolved 205 S. cerevisiae populations (124 haploid and 81 diploid) for [~]10,000 generations in three environments. We measured the dynamics of fitness changes over time, finding repeatable patterns of declining adaptability. Sequencing revealed that this phenotypic adaptation is coupled with a steady accumulation of mutations, widespread genetic parallelism, and historical contingency. In contrast to long-term evolution in E. coli, we do not observe long-term coexistence or populations with highly elevated mutation rates. We find that evolution in diploid populations involves both fixation of heterozygous mutations and frequent loss-of-heterozygosity events. Together, these results help distinguish aspects of evolutionary dynamics that are likely to be general features of adaptation across many systems from those that are specific to individual organisms and environmental conditions.",

Simulation analysis showed that Mirage can accurately estimate complex and heterogeneous gene gain/loss rates and reconstruct gene-content evolutionary history. Application to empirical datasets demonstrated that our evolutionary model better fits genome data from various taxonomic groups than other models.

Unfortunately, anemia is a known dose-limiting side effect of these inhibitors and presents a major caveat to development of antiglycolytic therapies. We developed specific inhibitors of enolase - a critical enzyme in glycolysis - and validated their metabolic and cellular effects on human erythrocytes. Enolase inhibition increases erythrocyte susceptibility to oxidative damage and induces rapid and premature erythrocyte senescence, rather than direct hemolysis. We apply our model of red cell toxicity to address questions regarding erythrocyte glycolytic disruption in the context of Plasmodium falciparum malaria pathogenesis.

Here we describe isolation of human intestinal phages infecting Bacteroides uniformis. Bacteroides is one of the most common bacterial groups in the global human gut microbiota, however, to date not many Bacteroides specific phages are known. Phages isolated in this study belong to a novel viral genus, Bacuni, within Siphoviridae family and represent the first lytic phages, genomes of which encode diversity generating retroelements (DGR). This region is assumed to promote phage adaptation to the rapidly changing environmental conditions and to broaden its host range. Three isolated phages showed 99,83% genome identity but infected distinct B. uniformis strains. The tropism of Bacuni phages appeared to be dependent on the interplay of DGR mediated sequence variations of phage fimbrial tip proteins and mutations in host genes coding for outer-membrane proteins. We found prophages with up to 85% aa similarity to Bacuni phages in the genomes of B. acidifaciens and Prevotella sp.. Despite the abundance of Bacteroides within human microbiome, we found Bacuni phages only in a limited subset of published gut metagenomes.\n\nImportanceThe lack of common marker gene in viruses require a precise characterization of diverse isolated phages to enhance metagenomic analyses and to understand their role in gut microbiota. Here we report the isolation of phages representing a new genus with characteristics so far not known or rarely described in intestinal phages. They are the first lytic phages specific for Bacteroides uniformis, a bacterial representative of the prevalent genus in the gut of humans and animals. Additionally, they are the first lytic phages containing specific regions (diversity generating retroelement) that putatively influence host tropism. The ability to switch constantly the targeted populations of the host species could provide an evolutionary advantage to these bacteriophages and may affect intra species diversity.",

This method has four components: i) camera setup and recording, ii) tempo/downbeat analysis and waveform cleanup, iii) OpenPose estimation and data extraction, and iv) synchronization analysis. Two trials were recorded: one in which the dancer danced synchronously to the music and one where they did not. The salsa dancer performed a solo basic salsa step continuously for 90 seconds to a salsa track while their movements and the music were recorded with a webcam. This data was then extracted from OpenPose and analyzed. The mean synchronization value for both feet was significantly lower in the synchronous condition than the asynchronous condition, indicating that this is an effective means to track and quantify a dancers movement and synchrony while performing a basic salsa step.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo determine whether being raised in a stigmatizing context influences neurodevelopment in children.\n\nMethodsWe drew data from one of the first national, multi-site neuroimaging studies with substantial variability in sociopolitical contexts: the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development study (N=11,534; M=9.9 years). We measured structural stigma surrounding gender, race, and Latinx ethnicity using objective state-level indicators of social policies and prejudicial attitudes and individual-level experiences of perceived discrimination, and examined associations with two neural markers: hippocampal volume and amygdala reactivity to threat.\n\nResultsIn a pre-registered analysis, we find that Black (B=-57.27, p=0.025) and Latinx (B=-41.02, p=0.037) youths raised in higher-stigma environments have smaller hippocampal volume than youths raised in low-stigma contexts, controlling for demographics and family socioeconomic status. This association was marginal among girls (p=0.082). The magnitude of the observed difference in hippocampal volume between high and low structural stigma contexts was equivalent to a $20,000 difference in annual family income. Stigmatizing environments were unrelated to hippocampal volume in non-stigmatized youth, providing evidence of specificity. Perceived discrimination was unrelated to hippocampal volume among any of the stigmatized groups. No associations between individual or structural forms of stigma and amygdala reactivity to threat were observed in the stigmatized groups.\n\nConclusionsWe provide novel evidence that an objective measure of stigma at the contextual level (structural stigma) may have a stronger influence on neurodevelopment than subjective perceptions of stigma measured at the individual level, suggesting that contextual approaches may yield new insights into neurodevelopment.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks regulate [~]24 hour oscillations in gene expression, behavior, and physiology. While the molecular and neural mechanisms of circadian rhythms are well characterized, how cellular organization of clock components controls circadian clock regulation remains poorly understood. Here, we elucidate how clock proteins regulate circadian rhythms by controlling the spatiotemporal organization of clock genes. Using high-resolution live imaging techniques we demonstrate that Drosophila clock proteins are concentrated in a few discrete foci and are organized at the nuclear envelope; these results are in contrast to longstanding expectations that clock proteins are diffusely distributed in the nucleus. We also show that clock protein foci are highly dynamic and change in number, size, and localization over the circadian cycle. Further, we demonstrate that clock genes are positioned at the nuclear periphery by the clock proteins precisely during the circadian repression phase, suggesting that subnuclear localization of clock genes plays an important role in the control of rhythmic gene expression. Finally, we show that Lamin B receptor, a nuclear envelope protein, is required for peripheral localization of clock protein foci and clock genes and for normal circadian rhythms. These results reveal that clock proteins form dynamic nuclear foci and play a hitherto unexpected role in the subnuclear reorganization of clock genes to control circadian rhythms, identifying a novel mechanism of circadian regulation. Our results further suggest a new role for clock protein foci in the clustering of clock-regulated genes during the repression phase to control gene co-regulation and circadian rhythms.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAlmost all living organisms have evolved circadian clocks to tell time. Circadian clocks regulate [~]24-hour oscillations in gene expression, behavior and physiology. Here, we reveal the surprisingly sophisticated spatiotemporal organization of clock proteins and clock genes and its critical role in circadian clock function. We show, in contrast to current expectations, that clock proteins are concentrated in a few discrete, dynamic nuclear foci at the nuclear envelope during the repression phase. Further, we uncovered several unexpected features of clock protein foci, including their role in positioning the clock genes at the nuclear envelope precisely during the repression phase to enable circadian rhythms. These studies provide fundamental new insights into the cellular mechanisms of circadian rhythms and establish direct links between nuclear organization and circadian clocks.",

    "abstract": "Brain connectome fingerprinting is rapidly rising as a novel influential field in brain network analysis. Yet, it is still unclear whether connectivity fingerprints could be effectively used for mapping and predicting disease progression from human brain data. We hypothesize that dysregulation of brain activity in disease would reflect in worse subject identification. Hence, we propose a novel framework, Clinical Connectome Fingerprinting, to detect individual connectome features from clinical populations. We show that \"clinical fingerprints\" can map individual variations between elderly healthy subjects and patients undergoing cognitive decline in functional connectomes extracted from magnetoencephalography data. We find that identifiability is reduced in patients as compared to controls, and show that these connectivity features are predictive of the individual Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score in patients. We hope that the proposed methodology can help in bridging the gap between connectivity features and biomarkers of brain dysfunction in large-scale brain networks.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTranscranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation whose potential as a cognitive therapy is hindered by our limited understanding of how participant and experimental factors influence its effects. Using functional MRI to study brain networks, we have previously shown in healthy controls that the physiological effects of tDCS are strongly influenced by brain state. We have additionally shown, in both healthy and traumatic brain injury (TBI) populations, that the behavioral effects of tDCS are positively correlated with white matter (WM) structure.\n\nObjectivesIn this study we investigate how these two factors, WM structure and brain state, interact to shape the effect of tDCS on brain network activity.\n\nMethodsWe applied anodal, cathodal and sham tDCS to the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) of healthy (n=22) and TBI participants (n=34). We used the Choice Reaction Task (CRT) performance to manipulate brain state during tDCS. We acquired simultaneous fMRI to assess activity of cognitive brain networks and used Fractional Anisotropy (FA) as a measure of WM structure.\n\nResultsWe find that the effects of tDCS on brain network activity in TBI participants are highly dependent on brain state, replicating findings from our previous healthy control study in a separate, patient cohort. We then show that WM structure further modulates the brain-state dependent effects of tDCS on brain network activity. These effects are not unidirectional - in the absence of task with anodal and cathodal tDCS, FA is positively correlated with brain activity in several regions of the default mode network. Conversely, with cathodal tDCS during CRT performance, FA is negatively correlated with brain activity in a salience network region.\n\nConclusionsOur results show that experimental and participant factors interact to have unexpected effects on brain network activity, and that these effects are not fully predictable by studying the factors in isolation.",

Maternal cytokines are proposed to affect fetal brain development in mice; however, the contribution of fetal immunity to neurodevelopmental disorders is largely unexplored. Here, we show that MIA mediated by Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), but not other TLRs, induces a specific set of behavioral phenotypes including decreased sociability and increased restricted repetitive behavior in offspring. Accordingly, these behavioral phenotypes were absent when offspring were deficient for Trif, the downstream adapter molecule of TLR3. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identified clusters of border-associated macrophages that were significantly enriched in the fetal brain following TLR3-MIA, and these clusters were diminished in Trif-/- fetal brains.Moreover, we found that triggering TLR3-TRIF in offspring can occur through transplacental viral infection, resulting in altered behavioral phenotypes. Collectively, our data indicate that fetal innate immunity contributes to MIA-induced atypical behaviors in mice.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 patients present high incidence of kidney abnormalities, which are associated with poor prognosis and high mortality. Identification of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney of COVID-19 patients suggests renal tropism and direct infection. Presently, it is generally recognized that SARS-CoV-2 initiates invasion through binding of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike protein to host cell-membrane receptor ACE2, however, whether there is additional target of SARS-CoV-2 in kidney remains unclear. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM1) is a transmembrane protein that drastically up-regulated after renal injury. Here, binding between SARS-CoV2-RBD and the extracellular Ig V domain of KIM1 was identified by molecular simulations and co-immunoprecipitation, which was comparable in affinity to that of ACE2 to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, KIM1 facilitated cell entry of SARS-CoV2-RBD, which was potently blockaded by a rationally designed KIM1-derived polypeptide. Together, the findings suggest KIM1 may mediate and exacerbate SARS-CoV-2 infection in a  vicious cycle, and KIM1 could be further explored as a therapeutic target.",

In mice, immunization with GX-19 elicited not only S-specific systemic and pulmonary antibody responses but also Th1-biased T cell responses in a dose-dependent manner. GX-19 vaccinated nonhuman primate seroconverted rapidly and exhibited detectable neutralizing antibody response as well as multifunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. Notably, when the immunized nonhuman primates were challenged at 10 weeks after the last vaccination with GX-19, they did not develop fever and reduced viral loads in contrast to non-vaccinated primates as a control. These findings indicate that GX-19 vaccination provides durable protective immune response and also support further development of GX-19 as a vaccine candidate for SARS-CoV-2 in human clinical trials.",

Even though PV+ basket cells are locally projecting interneurons, their axons are myelinated. Can this myelination contribute in any significant way to the speed of action potential propagation along such short axons? We used dual whole cell recordings of synaptically connected PV+ interneurons and their postsynaptic target in acutely-prepared neocortical slices from adult mice to measure the amplitude and latency of single presynaptic action potential-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). These same neurons were then imaged with immunofluorescent array tomography, the synaptic contacts between them identified and a precise map of the connections was generated, with the exact axonal length and extent of myelin coverage. Our results support that myelination of PV+ basket cells significantly increases conduction velocity, and does so to a degree that can be physiologically relevant.",

    "abstract": "Precisely characterizing mental representations of visual experiences requires careful control of experimental stimuli. Recent work leveraging such stimulus control has led to important insights; however, these findings are constrained to simple visual properties like colour and line orientation. There remains a critical methodological barrier to characterizing perceptual and mnemonic representations of realistic visual experiences. Here, we introduce a novel method to systematically control visual properties of natural scene stimuli. Using generative adversarial networks (GAN), a state-of-art deep learning technique for creating highly realistic synthetic images, we generated scene wheels in which continuously changing visual properties smoothly transition between meaningful realistic scenes. To validate the efficacy of scene wheels, we conducted two behavioral experiments that assess perceptual and mnemonic representations attained from the scene wheels. In the perceptual validation experiment, we tested whether the continuous transition of scene images along the wheel is reflected in human perceptual similarity judgment. The perceived similarity of the scene images correspondingly decreased as distances between the images increase on the wheel. In the memory experiment, participants reconstructed to-be-remembered scenes from the scene wheels. Reconstruction errors for these scenes resemble error distributions observed in prior studies using simple stimulus properties. Importantly, perceptual similarity judgment and memory precision varied systematically with scene wheel radius. These findings suggest our novel approach offers a window into the mental representations of naturalistic visual experiences.",

    "abstract": "The mitotic spindle is a microtubule-based machine that pulls the two identical sets of chromosomes to opposite ends of the cell during cell division. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is an important model organism for studying mitosis due to its simple, stereotyped spindle structure and well-established genetic toolset. S. pombe spindle length is a useful metric for mitotic progression, but manually tracking spindle ends in each frame to measure spindle length over time is laborious and can limit experimental throughput. We have developed an ImageJ plugin that can automatically track S. pombe spindle length over time and replace manual or semi-automated tracking of spindle elongation dynamics. Using an algorithm that detects the principal axis of the spindle and then finds its ends, we reliably track the length and angle of the spindle as the cell divides. The plugin integrates with existing ImageJ features, exports its data for further analysis outside of ImageJ, and does not require any programming by the user. Thus, the plugin provides an accessible tool for quantification of S. pombe spindle length that will allow automatic analysis of large microscopy data sets and facilitate screening for effects of cell biological perturbations on mitotic progression.",

    "abstract": "Birth-death stochastic processes are the foundation of many phylogenetic models and are widely used to make inferences about epidemiological and macroevolutionary dynamics. There are a large number of birth-death model variants that have been developed; these impose different assumptions about the temporal dynamics of the parameters and about the sampling process. As each of these variants was individually derived, it has been difficult to understand the relationships between them as well as their precise biological and mathematical assumptions. Without a common mathematical foundation, deriving new models is non-trivial. Here we unify these models into a single framework, prove that many previously developed epidemiological and macroevolutionary models are all special cases of a more general model, and illustrate the connections between these variants. This framework centers around a technique for deriving likelihood functions for arbitrarily complex birth-death(-sampling) models that will allow researchers to explore a wider array of scenarios than was previously possible. We then use this frame-work to derive general model likelihoods for both the \"single-type\" case in which all lineages diversify according to the same process and the \"multi-type\" case, where there is variation in the process among lineages. By re-deriving existing single-type birth-death sampling models we clarify and synthesize the range of explicit and implicit assumptions made by these models.",

    "abstract": "Post-zygotic mutations incurred during DNA replication, DNA repair, and other cellular processes lead to somatic mosaicism. Somatic mosaicism is an established cause of various diseases, including cancers. However, detecting mosaic variants in DNA from non-cancerous somatic tissues poses significant challenges, particularly if the variants only are present in a small fraction of cells. Here, the Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network conducted a coordinated, multi-institutional study to: (i) examine the ability of existing methods to detect simulated somatic single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in DNA mixing experiments; (ii) generate multiple replicates of whole genome sequencing data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, other brain regions, dura mater, and dural fibroblasts of a single neurotypical individual; (iii) devise strategies to discover somatic SNVs; and (iv) apply various approaches to validate somatic SNVs. These efforts led to the identification of 43 bona fide somatic SNVs that ranged in variant allele fractions from ~0.005 to ~0.28. Guided by these results, we devised best practices for calling mosaic SNVs from 250X whole genome sequencing data in the accessible portion of the human genome that achieve 90% specificity and sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrated that analysis of multiple bulk DNA samples from a single individual allows the reconstruction of early developmental cell lineage trees. Thus, this study provides a unified set of best practices to detect somatic SNVs in non-cancerous tissues. The data and methods are freely available to the scientific community and should serve as a guide to assess the contributions of somatic SNVs to neuropsychiatric diseases.",

    "abstract": "Advances in experimental technologies such as DNA sequencing have opened up new avenues for the applications of phylogenetic methods to various fields beyond their traditional application in evolutionary investigations, extending to the fields of development, differentiation, cancer genomics, and immunogenomics. Thus, the importance of phylogenetic methods is increasingly being recognized, and the development of a novel phylogenetic approach can contribute to several areas of research. Recently, the use of hyperbolic geometry has attracted attention in artificial intelligence research. Hyperbolic space can better represent a hierarchical structure compared to Euclidean space, and can therefore be useful for describing and analyzing a phylogenetic tree. In this study, we developed a novel metric that considers the characteristics of a phylogenetic tree for representation in hyperbolic space. We compared the performance of the proposed hyperbolic embeddings, general hyperbolic embeddings, and Euclidean embeddings, and confirmed that our method could be used to more precisely reconstruct evolutionary distance. We also demonstrate that our approach is useful for predicting the nearest-neighbor node in a partial phylogenetic tree with missing nodes. This study highlights the utility of adopting a geometric approach for further advancing the applications of phylogenetic methods.\n\nThe demo code is attached as a supplementary file in a compiled jupyter notebook.

Using single-molecule DNA unzipping with optical tweezers, we reveal that linker histone interactions with DNA are remarkably extended, with the C-terminal domain binding both DNA linkers as far as ~ {+/-}140 bp from the dyad. In addition to a symmetrical compaction of the nucleosome core governed by globular domain contacts at the dyad, the C-terminal domain compacts the nucleosomes entry and exit. These interactions are dynamic, exhibiting rapid binding and dissociation, sensitive to phosphorylation of a specific residue, and crucial to determining the symmetry of the chromatosomes core. Extensive unzipping of the linker DNA, which mimics its invasion by motor proteins, shifts H1 into an asymmetric, off-dyad configuration and triggers nucleosome decompaction, highlighting the plasticity of the chromatosome structure and its potential regulatory role.",

MD simulations offer a unique tool to characterize the molecular interactions governing the formation of these biomolecular condensates, their physico-chemical properties, and the factors controlling their composition and size. However, biopolymer condensation depends sensitively on the balance between different energetic and entropic contributions. Here, we develop a general strategy to fine-tune the potential energy function for molecular dynamics simulations of biopolymer phase separation. We rebalance protein-protein interactions against solvation and entropic contributions to match the excess free energy of transferring proteins between dilute solution and condensate. We illustrate this formalism by simulating liquid droplet formation of the FUS low complexity domain (LCD) with a rebalanced MARTINI model. By scaling the strength of the nonbonded interactions in the coarse-grained MARTINI potential energy function, we map out a phase diagram in the plane of protein concentration and interaction strength. Above a critical scaling factor of c {approx} 0.6, FUS LCD condensation is observed, where  = 1 and 0 correspond to full and repulsive interactions in the MARTINI model, respectively. For a scaling factor  = 0.65, we recover the experimental densities of the dilute and dense phases, and thus the excess protein transfer free energy into the droplet and the saturation concentration where FUS LCD condenses. In the region of phase separation, we simulate FUS LCD droplets of four different sizes in stable equilibrium with the dilute phase and slabs of condensed FUS LCD for tens of microseconds, and over one millisecond in aggregate. We determine surface tensions in the range of 0.01 to 0.4mN/m from the fluctuations of the droplet shape and from the capillary-wave-like broadening of the interface between the two phases. From the dynamics of the protein end-to-end distance, we estimate shear viscosities from 0.001 to 0.02Pas for the FUS LCD droplets with scaling factors  in the range of 0.625 to 0.75, where we observe liquid droplets. Significant hydration of the interior of the droplets keeps the proteins mobile and the droplets fluid.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDihydroorotate Dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a key enzyme of the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, whose inhibition was recently found to induce differentiation and apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). DHODH inhibitors were previously investigated in solid tumors, where they showed promising antiproliferative activity, both in vitro and in vivo. However, their effectiveness was not confirmed in clinical trials, probably due to the pyrimidine salvage pathway that cancer cells could exploit to survive. In this study we investigated the pro-apoptotic activity of MEDS433, the DHODH inhibitor developed by our group, against AML. Learning from previous failures, we challenged our model mimicking in vivo conditions, and looked for synergic combination to boost apoptosis.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated the apoptotic rate of multiple AML cell lines and AML primary cells treated with MEDS433 or other DHODH inhibitors, alone and in combination with classical antileukemic drugs or with dipyridamole, a blocker of the pyrimidine salvage pathway. Experiments were also performed mimicking in vivo conditions, i.e., in the presence of physiological uridine plasma levels (5 M).\n\nResultsMEDS433 showed a strong apoptotic effect against multiple AML cell lines, which was at least partially independent from the differentiation process. Its combination with classical antileukemic agents resulted in a further increase of the apoptotic rate. However, when MEDS433 was tested in the presence of 5 M uridine and/or in primary AML cells, results were less impressive. On the contrary, the combination of MEDS433 with dipyridamole resulted in an outstanding synergistic effect, with a dramatic increase of the apoptotic rate both in AML cell lines and AML primary cells, which was unaffected by physiological uridine concentrations. Preliminary analyses show that the toxicity of this treatment should be limited to proliferating cells.\n\nConclusionsThe combination of a DHODH inhibitor and dipyridamole is characterized by differentiating and pro-apoptotic features and induces metabolic lethality on a wide variety of AMLs with different genetic backgrounds.",

    "abstract": "Biological systems are intrinsically noisy and this noise may determine the qualitative outcome of the system. In the absence of analytical solutions to mathematical models incorporating noise, stochastic simulation algorithms are useful to explore the possible trajectories of these systems. Algorithms used for such stochastic simulations include the Gillespie algorithm and its approximations. In this study we introduce cayenne, an easy to use Python package containing accurate and fast implementations of the Gillespie algorithm (direct method), the tau-leaping algorithm and a tau-adaptive algorithm. We compare the accuracy of cayenne with other stochastic simulation libraries (BioSimulator.jl, GillespieSSA and Tellurium) and find that cayenne offers the best trade-off between accuracy and speed. Additionally, we highlight the importance of performing accuracy tests for stochastic simulation libraries, and hope that it becomes standard practice when developing the same.\n\nThe cayenne package can be found at https://github.com/Heuro-labs/cayenne while the bench-marks can be found at https://github.com/Heuro-labs/cayenne-benchmarks",

    "abstract": "Rapid visual perception is often viewed as a bottom-up process. Category-preferred neural regions are often characterized as automatic, default processing mechanisms for visual inputs of their categorical preference. To explore the sensitivity of such regions to top-down information, we examined three scene-preferring brain regions, the occipital place area (OPA), the parahippocampal place area (PPA), and the retrosplenial complex (RSC), and tested whether the processing of outdoor scenes is influenced by the functional contexts in which they are seen. Context was manipulated by presenting real-world landscape images as if being viewed through a window or within a picture frame; manipulations that do not affect scene content but do affect ones functional knowledge regarding the scene. This manipulation influences neural scene processing (as measured by fMRI): the OPA and PPA exhibited greater neural activity when participants viewed images as if through a window as compared to within a picture frame, while the RSC did not show this difference. In a separate behavioral experiment, functional context affected scene memory in predictable directions (boundary extension). Our interpretation is that the window context denotes three-dimensionality, therefore rendering the perceptual experience of viewing landscapes as more realistic. Conversely, the frame context denotes a two-dimensional image. As such, more spatially-biased scene representations in the OPA and the PPA are influenced by differences in top-down, perceptual expectations generated from context. In contrast, more semantically-biased scene representations in the RSC are likely to be less affected by top-down signals that carry information about the physical layout of a scene.",

When asked to judge emotions by attending to either face or voice, the accuracy was higher when facial expressions are congruent with vocal expressions than when they are incongruent. This congruency effect was shown to be affected by cultural background. Here we conducted functional MRI alongside a multisensory emotion perception task involving Japanese and Dutch participants. They were presented with movies in which congruent or incongruent emotions were expressed through faces and voices. The participants were asked to judge the emotion of either the face or the voice. Consistent with previous studies, behavioral results showed an interaction between group and task. fMRI results revealed that during voice-based judgement, congruency effects of the primary visual cortex, by means of the task related activity of congruent stimuli subtracted by that of incongruent stimuli, were more prominent in the Dutch group than in Japanese group. Finally, behavioral and neural congruency effects of the primary visual cortex were positively correlated only in the Dutch group. Taken together, our results show that culture affects the activities of early sensory areas in multisensory perception from facial and vocal expressions.",

    "abstract": "Human cortical malformations are associated with progenitor proliferation and neuronal migration abnormalities. Progenitor cells include apical radial glia, intermediate progenitors and basal (or outer) radial glia (bRGs or oRGs). bRGs are few in number in lissencephalic species (e.g. the mouse) but abundant in gyrencephalic brains. The LIS1 gene coding for a dynein regulator, is mutated in human lissencephaly, associated also in some cases with microcephaly. LIS1 was shown to be important during cell division and neuronal migration. Here, we generated bRG-like cells in the mouse embryonic brain, investigating the role of Lis1 in their formation. This was achieved by in utero electroporation of a hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 (coding for a RAB-GAP protein) at mouse embryonic day (E) 14.5. We first confirmed that TBC1D3 expression in wild-type (WT) brain generates numerous Pax6+ bRG-like cells that are basally localized. Second, using the same approach, we assessed the formation of these cells in heterozygote Lis1 mutant brains. Our novel results show that Lis1 depletion in the forebrain from E9.5 prevented subsequent TBC1D3-induced bRG-like cell amplification. Indeed, we observe disruption of the ventricular zone (VZ) in the mutant. Lis1 depletion altered adhesion proteins and mitotic spindle orientations at the ventricular surface and increased the proportion of abventricular mitoses. Progenitor outcome could not be further altered by TBC1D3. We conclude that perturbation of Lis1/LIS1 dosage is likely to be detrimental for appropriate progenitor number and position, contributing to lissencephaly pathogenesis.",

This identifies topographies that reduce colonization in vitro by up to 15-fold compared with a flat surface for both motile and non-motile bacterial pathogens. Equivalent reductions are achieved on polyurethane, a polymer commonly used in medical devices. Using machine learning methods, a set of design rules based on generalisable descriptors is established for predicting bacteria-resistant micro topographies. In a murine foreign body infection model, anti-attachment topographies are shown to be refractory to P. aeruginosa and to recruit a productive host response, highlighting the potential of simple topographical patterning of non-eluting implants for preventing medical device associated infections.",

We show that abnormal expression of the replication licensing factor Cdc18 in fission yeast, which leads to genome-wide re-replication, drives the formation of CNGs at different genomic loci, promoting the acquisition of new selectable traits. Whole genome sequencing reveals Mb long, primarily extrachromosomal amplicons. Genetic analysis shows that homology-mediated repair is required to resolve re-replication intermediates into heritable CNGs. Consistently, we show that in mammalian cells overexpression of CDC6 and/or CDT1 leads to CNGs and promotes drug resistance. In human cells, multiple repair pathways are activated upon rereplication and act antagonistically, with RAD52 promoting and 53BP1 inhibiting CNG formation. In tumours, CDT1 and/or CDC6 overexpression correlates with copy number gains genome-wide. We propose re-replication as an evolutionary-conserved driver of CNGs, highlighting a link between aberrant licensing, CNGs and cancer.",

We find that the steroid-hormone ecdysone triggers parallel pupariation neuromotor and morphogenetic subprograms, which include the induction of the relaxin-peptide hormone, Dilp8, in the epidermis. Dilp8 acts on six Lgr3-positive thoracic interneurons to couple both subprograms in time and to instruct neuromotor subprogram switching during behavior. Our work reveals that interorgan feedback gates progression between subunits of an innate behavior and points to an ancestral neuromodulatory function of relaxin signaling.",

    "abstract": "Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based lipidomics generate a large dataset, which requires high-performance data pre-processing tools for their interpretation such as XCMS, mzMine and Progenesis. These pre-processing tools rely heavily on accurate peak detection, which depends on setting the peak detection mass tolerance (PDMT) properly. The PDMT is usually set with a fixed value in either ppm or Da units. However, this fixed value may result in duplicates or missed peak detection. Therefore, we developed the dynamic binning method for accurate peak detection, which takes into account the peak broadening described by well-known physics laws of ion separation and set dynamically the value of PDMT as a function of m/z. Namely, in our method, the PDMT is proportional to [Formula] for FTICR, to [Formula] for Orbitrap, to m/z for Q-TOF and is a constant for Quadrupole mass analyzer, respectively. The dynamic binning method was implemented in XCMS [1,2] and the adopted source code is available in the Appendix. Our further goal was to compare the performance of different lipidomics pre-processing tools to find differential compounds. We have generated set samples with 43 lipids internal standards differentially spiked to aliquots of one human plasma lipid sample using Orbitrap LC-MS/MS. The performance of the various pipelines using aligned parameter sets was quantified by a quality score system which reflects the ability of a pre-processing pipeline to detect differential peaks spiked at various concentration levels. The quality score indicates that the dynamic binning method improves the performance of XCMS (maximum p-value 9.8{middle dot}10-3 of two-sample Wilcoxon test). The modified XCMS software was further compared with mzMine and Progenesis. The results showed that modified XCMS and Progenesis had a similarly good performance in the aspect of finding differential compounds. In addition, Progenesis shows lower variability as indicated by lower CVs, followed by XCMS and mzMine. The lower variability of Progenesis improve the quantification, however, provide an incorrect quantification abundance order of spiked-in internal standards.",

Our results showed that the dNMM was capable of correctly estimating firing rate responses under both steady- and dynamic-input conditions. Finally, it was also able to quantitatively describe the effect of spike-frequency adaptation on the generation of asynchronous irregular activity of excitatory-inhibitory cortical networks. We conclude that in terms of its biological reality and calculation efficiency, the dNMM is a suitable candidate to build very large-scale network models involving multiple brain areas.",

    "abstract": "The mature cerebellum controls motor skill precision and participates in other sophisticated brain functions that include learning, cognition and speech. Different types of GABAergic and glutamatergic cerebellar neurons originate in temporal order from two progenitor niches, the ventricular zone and rhombic lip, which express the transcription factors Ptf1a and Atoh1, respectively. However, the molecular machinery required to specify the distinct neuronal types emanating from these progenitor zones is still unclear. Here, we uncover the transcription factor Olig3 as a major determinant in generating the earliest neuronal derivatives emanating from both progenitor zones. In the rhombic lip, Olig3 regulates progenitor cell proliferation. In the ventricular zone, Olig3 safeguards Purkinje cell specification by curtailing the expression of Pax2, a transcription factor that we found to impose an inhibitory interneuron identity. Our work thus defines Olig3 as a key factor in cerebellar development.",

    "abstract": "To achieve high sensitivity at scotopic levels, vision sacrifices spatial and temporal resolution. The detection of dim light, however, depends crucially on the ability of the visual system to speed up rod signals as they advance towards the brain. At higher light levels, gain control mechanisms are necessary to prevent premature saturation of second-order neurons. We investigated how goldfish mixed-input ON bipolar cells (ON mBCs) manage to partially compensate for the intrinsically slow kinetics of rod signals in the dark-adapted state, and at the same time control the gain of rod signals. Rod-driven responses of axotomized ON mBCs become faster and more transient than those of rod horizontal cells as stimulus intensity increases. This transientness has a voltage-dependency consistent with the activation of a voltage-gated K+ conductance. Simulations with NEURON indicate that the voltage-gated K+ channels responsible for speeding up responses are concentrated at the distal tips of the bipolar cell dendrites, close to the glutamate receptors. These channels act as a gain control mechanism, by shunting the effect of tonically hyperpolarized rods onto the ON mBC. Further activation of K+ channels accelerates the ON mBC response by decreasing the membrane time constant as light levels increase. Therefore, the presence of voltage-gated K+ channels at the dendritic tips of ON mBCs extends the dynamic range of these neurons, and at the same time generates a transient signal already at the first visual synapse.\n\nKey Points SummaryO_LIHere we show that voltage-gated potassium channels can adjust the gain of the rod input to mixed-input ON bipolar cells and generate a transient signal already at the first visual synapse.\nC_LIO_LIThese channels are activated during the light-induced depolarization, making bipolar cell light responses smaller, faster, and more transient, effects that can be abolished by the K+ channel blocker TEA.\nC_LIO_LIMathematical simulations suggest that these channels are concentrated at the bipolar cell dendritic tips, close to the site of rod input.\nC_LIO_LIThis kind of gain control happens at all levels in the retina and is especially important for cells that receive mixed input from rods and cones, in order to prevent premature saturation with increasing light levels and remove the temporal redundancy of the photoreceptor signal.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of an error when performing a motor sequence causes an immediate reduction in speed on subsequent trials, which is referred to as post-error slowing. However, understanding how post-error slowing changes with practice has been difficult because it requires extended practice on a novel sequence task. To address this issue, we examined post-error slowing in a novel glove-based typing task that participants performed for 15 consecutive days. Speed and accuracy improved from the early to middle stages of practice, but did not show any further improvements between middle and late stage of practice. However, when we analyzed the response to errors, we found that participants decreased both the magnitude and duration of post-error slowing with practice, even after there were no detectable improvements in overall task performance. These results indicate that learning not only improves overall task performance but also modifies the ability to respond to errors.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian cells have to adapt to environmental challenges that range from mild to severe stress. While the cellular response to mild stress has been widely studied, how cells respond to severe stress remains unclear. We show here that under severe stress conditions, cells induce a transient hibernation-like mechanism that anticipates recovery. We demonstrate that this Adaptive Pausing Response (APR) is a coordinated cellular response that limits ATP supply and consumption though mitochondrial fragmentation and widespread pausing of mRNA translation. This pausing is accomplished by ribosome stalling at translation initiation codons, which keeps mRNAs poised to resume translation upon recovery from severe stress. We further show that recovery from severe stress involves adaptive ISR (Integrated Stress Response) signaling that in turn permits cell cycle progression, resumption of growth, and reversal of mitochondria fragmentation. Our findings indicate that cells can respond to severe stress through the APR, a mechanism that preserves vital elements of cellular function under harsh environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "Several hypotheses explain the prevalence of undifferentiated sex chromosomes in poikilothermic vertebrates. Turnovers change the master sex determination gene, the sex chromosome or the sex determination system (e.g. XY to WZ). Jumping master genes stay main triggers but translocate to other chromosomes. Occasional recombination (e.g. in sex-reversed females) prevents sex chromosome degeneration. Recent research has uncovered conserved heteromorphic or even homomorphic sex chromosomes in several clades of non-avian and non-mammalian vertebrates. Sex determination in sturgeons (Acipenseridae) has been a long-standing basic biological question, linked to economical demands by the caviar-producing aquaculture. Here, we report the discovery of a sex-specific sequence from sterlet (Acipenser ruthenus). Using chromosome-scale assemblies and pool-sequencing, we first identified a ~16 kb female-specific region. We developed a PCR-genotyping test, yielding female-specific products in six species, spanning the entire phylogeny with the most divergent extant lineages (A. sturio, A. oxyrinchus vs. A. ruthenus, Huso huso), stemming from an ancient tetraploidization. Similar results were obtained in two octoploid species (A. gueldenstaedtii, A. baerii). Conservation of a female-specific sequence for a long period, representing 180 My of sturgeon evolution, and across at least one polyploidization event, raises many interesting biological questions. We discuss a conserved undifferentiated sex chromosome system with a ZZ/ZW-mode of sex determination and potential alternatives.",

    "abstract": "Proteins and non-coding RNAs are functional products of the genome that carry out the bulk of crucial cellular processes. With recent technological advances, researchers can sequence genomes in the thousands as well as probe for specific genomic activities of multiple species and conditions. These studies have identified thousands of potential proteins, RNAs and associated activities, however there are conflicting conclusions on the functional implications depending upon the burden of evidence researchers use, leading to diverse interpretations of which regions of the genome are \"functional\". Here we investigate the association between gene functionality and genomic features, by comparing established functional protein-coding and non-coding genes to non-genic regions of the genome. We find that the strongest and most consistent association between functional genes and any genomic feature is evolutionary conservation and transcriptional activity. Other strongly associated features include sequence alignment statistics, such as maximum between-site covariation. We have also identified some concerns with 1,000 Genomes Project and Genome Aggregation Database SNP densities, as short non-coding RNAs tend to have greater than expected SNP densities. Our results demonstrate the importance of evolutionary conservation and transcription for sequence functionality, which should both be taken into consideration when differentiating between functional sequences and noise.",

    "abstract": "A distinctive feature of glycans vis-a-vis proteins and nucleic acids is its structural complexity which arises from the huge repertoire of monosaccharides, isomeric linkages and branching. Around 70 monosaccharides have so far been discovered in natural glycans and the pathway for the biosynthesis of 57 of these have been experimentally characterized. However, there is no common platform with a comprehensive information of monosaccharide pathways and enzymes. We have gathered 542 experimentally characterized enzymes of these pathways from literature and set up a first of its kind database called GlycoPathDB (http://www.bio.iitb.ac.in/glycopathdb/). Annotations such as the reaction catalysed, substrate specificity, biosynthesis pathway and PubMed IDs are provided for all the enzymes in the database. Sequence homologs of the experimentally characterized enzymes found in nearly 13,000 completely sequenced genomes from Bacteria and Archaea have also been included in the database. This platform will help in deduction of evolutionary relationships among enzymes such as aminotransferases, nucleotidyltransferases, acetyltransferases and SDR family enzymes. It can also facilitate experimental studies such as direct enzyme assays to validate putative annotations, establish structure-function relationship, expression profiling to determine the function, determine the phenotypic consequences of gene knock-out/knock-in and complementation studies.",
