    "abstract": "Multiplexed proteomics is a powerful tool to assay cell states in health and disease, but accurate quantification of relative protein changes is impaired by interference from co-isolated peptides. Interference can be reduced by using MS3-based quantification, but this reduces sensitivity and requires specialized instrumentation. An alternative approach is quantification by complementary ions, which allows accurate and precise multiplexed quantification at the MS2 level and is compatible with the most widely distributed instruments. However, complementary ions of the popular TMT tag form inefficiently and multiplexing is limited to five channels. Here, we evaluate and optimize complementary ion quantification for the recently released TMTPro tag, which increases plexing capacity to eight channels (TMTProC). We find that the beneficial fragmentation properties of TMTPro increase quantification signal five-fold compared to TMT. This increased sensitivity results in ~65% more proteins quantified compared to TMTPro-MS3 and even slightly outperforms TMTPro-MS2. Furthermore, TMTProC quantification is more accurate than TMTPro-MS2 and even superior to TMTPro-MS3. To demonstrate the power of TMTProC, we analyzed a human and yeast interference sample and were able to quantify 13,290 proteins in 24 fractions. Thus, TMTProC advances multiplexed proteomics data quality and widens access to accurate multiplexed proteomics beyond laboratories with MS3-capable instrumentation.",

    "abstract": "About 20-30% of cancer-associated deaths are due to complications from cachexia which is characterized by skeletal muscle atrophy. Metabolic reprogramming in cancer cells causes body-wide metabolic and proteomic remodeling, which remain poorly understood. Here, we present evidence that the oncometabolite D-2-hydroxylgutarate (D2-HG) impairs NAD+ redox homeostasis in skeletal myotubes, causing atrophy via deacetylation of LC3-II by the nuclear deacetylase Sirt1. Overexpression of p300 or silencing of Sirt1 abrogate its interaction with LC3, and subsequently reduced levels of LC3 lipidation. Using RNA-sequencing and mass spectrometry-based metabolomics and proteomics, we demonstrate that prolonged treatment with the oncometabolite D2-HG in mice promotes cachexia in vivo and increases the abundance of proteins and metabolites, which are involved in energy substrate metabolism, chromatin acetylation and autophagy regulation. We further show that D2-HG promotes a sex-dependent adaptation in skeletal muscle using network modeling and machine learning algorithms. Our multi-omics approach exposes new metabolic vulnerabilities in response to D2-HG in skeletal muscle and provides a conceptual framework for identifying therapeutic targets in cachexia.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to investigate a relatively unstudied memory condition for paradoxical combinations of item + source memory confidence responses, which challenged the conventional views of the memory processes supporting item and source memory judgments. We studied instances in which people provided accurate source memory judgments (conventionally ascribed as representing recollection) after having first produced low- confidence item recognition hits for the same items (conventionally thought to reflect familiarity-based processing). This paradoxical combination does not fit traditional accounts of being recollection (because it had low-confidence recognition) nor accounts of familiarity (since it had accurate source memory), and event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to adjudicate which processes support these kinds of memories. ERP results were unlike the conventional ERP effects of memory, lacking both an FN400 and the parietal old-new effect (LPC), and instead exhibited a significant negative-going ERP effect occurring later in time (800-1200ms) in central-parietal sites. Behavioral measures of response times revealed a crossover interaction: low confident recognition hits were slower during recognition but faster during source memory when compared to the opposite pattern seen for instances of high confident hits. Results provide a comprehensive characterization of the individual variability of the FN400 and LPC effects of memory, while adding the behavioral and physiological characterization of a late negative-going ERP effect for accurate source memory without recollection. Conclusions indicated that episodic context could be retrieved independently from recollection, while suggesting a role for a process of context familiarity that is independent from item-familiarity.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRecollection is often defined as remembering the source or context of information\nC_LIO_LIPrior work used ERPs to identify times when source memory did not have recollection\nC_LIO_LICurrent work replicated ERPs with added response times and measures of variance\nC_LIO_LIRecollection was not evident in certain source memories, which had a negative ERP\nC_LIO_LIRecollection is independent of context and is more than just remembering sources\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=182 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/339697v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (69K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4926f8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d87d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@40a701org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9460f1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers the way to new insights while increasing the spatial and temporal resolution. However, a crucial concern in 7T human MRI is the increase in power deposition, supervised through the specific absorption rate (SAR). The SAR limitation can restrict the brain coverage or the minimal repetition time of fMRI experiments. fMRI is based on the well-known gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI) sequence, which offers ultrafast acquisition. Commonly, the GRE-EPI sequence comprises two pulses: fat suppression and excitation. This work provides the means for a significant reduction in the SAR by circumventing the fat-suppression pulse. Without this fat-suppression, however, lipid signal can result in artifacts due to the chemical shift between the lipid and water signals. Our approach exploits a reconstruction similar to the simultaneous-multi-slice (SMS) method to separate the lipid and water images, thus avoiding undesired lipid artifacts in brain images. The lipid-water separation is based on the known spatial shift of the lipid signal, which can be detected by the multi-channel coils sensitivity profiles. Our study shows robust human imaging, offering greater flexibility to reduce the SAR, shorten the repetition time or increase the volume coverage with substantial benefit for brain functional studies.",

    "abstract": "Previous research indicates that the size of interpersonal space at which the other is perceived as intrusive (permeability) and the ability to adapt interpersonal distance based on contextual factors (flexibility) are altered in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, the neurophysiological basis of these alterations remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we used fMRI and assessed interpersonal space preferences of individuals with ASD before and after engaging in cooperative and non-cooperative social interactions. Compared to matched controls, ASDs showed lower comfort in response to an approaching confederate, indicating preference for larger interpersonal space in autism (altered permeability). This preference was accompanied by reduced activity in bilateral dorsal intraparietal sulcus (dIPS) and left fusiform face area (FFA), regions previously shown to be involved in interpersonal space regulation. Furthermore, we observed differences in effective connectivity among dIPS, FFA, and amygdala in ASDs compared to controls, depending on the level of experienced comfort. No differences between groups were observed in interpersonal space regulation after an experienced social interaction (flexibility). Taken together, the present findings suggest that a dysregulation of the activity and connectivity of brain areas involved in interpersonal space processing may contribute to avoidance of physical proximity and social impairments in ASD.",

Here we investigate whether we can use this approach to explore long-range connections between the cerebellum and cerebral cortex.\n\nObjectiveTo assess the feasibility of using cerebellar TMS-EEG for the exploration of cerebellar-cerebral network dynamics.\n\nMethodsTen healthy adults received single-pulse suprathreshold TMS to the cerebellum and an occipital/parietal control site with double-cone and figure-of-eight coils while cerebral activity was recorded. A multisensory electrical control condition was used to simulate the sensation of the double-cone coil at the cerebellar site. Two cleaning pipelines were compared, and the spatiotemporal relationships of the EEG output between conditions were examined at sensor and source levels.\n\nResultsCerebellar stimulation with the double-cone coil resulted in large artefacts in the EEG trace. The addition of SOUND filtering to the cleaning pipeline improved the signal such that further analyses could be undertaken. The cortical potentials evoked by the active TMS conditions showed strong relationships with the responses to the multisensory control condition after ~50 ms. A distinct parietal component at ~42 ms was found following cerebellar double-cone stimulation.\n\nConclusionsCerebellar double-cone stimulation produces large artefacts in the EEG. Cerebellar-specific responses could not be reliably differentiated from sensory evoked potentials after ~50 ms. While evoked potentials differed across conditions at early latencies, it is unclear as to whether these represented TMS-related network activation of the cerebellarthalamocortical tract, or whether components were dominated by sensory contamination and/or coil-driven artefacts. Further work will be required to clarify the specific contribution of cerebellar-cortical connectivity to the observed early latency signals.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection results in viral burden in the upper and lower respiratory tract, enabling transmission and often leading to substantial lung pathology. Delivering the antiviral treatment directly to the lungs has the potential to improve lung bioavailability and dosing efficiency. As the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike (S) is increasingly deemed to be a clinically validated target, RBD-specific B cells were isolated from patients following SARS-CoV-2 infection to derive a panel of fully human monoclonal antibodies (hmAbs) that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2. The most potent hmAb, 1212C2 was derived from an IgM memory B cell, has high affinity for SARS-CoV-2 RBD which enables its direct inhibition of RBD binding to ACE2. The 1212C2 hmAb exhibits in vivo prophylactic and therapeutic activity against SARS-CoV-2 in hamsters when delivered intraperitoneally, achieving a meaningful reduction in upper and lower respiratory viral burden and lung pathology. Furthermore, liquid nebulized inhale treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected hamsters with as low as 0.6 mg/kg of inhaled dose, corresponding to approximately 0.03 mg/kg of lung deposited dose, mediated a reduction in respiratory viral burden that is below the detection limit, and mitigated lung pathology. The therapeutic efficacy achieved at an exceedingly low-dose of inhaled 1212C2 supports the rationale for local lung delivery and achieving dose-sparing benefits as compared to the conventional parenteral route of administration. Taken together, these results warrant an accelerated clinical development of 1212C2 hmAb formulated and delivered via inhalation for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe need for safe and effective antiviral treatments is pressing given the number of viral infections that are prevalent in animal and human populations, often causing devastating economic losses and mortality. Informal accounts of anecdotal use of chlorine dioxide (ClO2), a well-known disinfectant and antiseptic, in COVID-19 patients has raised concern about potential toxicity, but also raises the question that ClO2 might elicit antiviral effects, a possibility that has never been examined in vivo in any animal model. Here, we challenged the hypothesis that ClO2 decreases the viral load and virus-induced mortality in a vertebrate model. For this, we determined viral load, virus-induced lesions and mortality in 10-day old chick embryos inoculated with 104 mean EID50/mL of attenuated Massachusetts and Connecticut avian coronavirus (IBV) strains.\n\nResultsThe ClO2 treatment had a marked impact on IBV infection. Namely, viral titres were 2.4-fold lower and mortality was reduced by half in infected embryos that were treated with ClO2. Infection led to developmental abnormalities regardless of treatment. Lesions typical of IBV infections were observed in all inoculated embryos, but severity tended to be significantly lower in ClO2-treated embryos. We found no gross or microscopic evidence of toxicity caused by ClO2 at the doses used herein.\n\nConclusionsOur study shows that ClO2 could be a safe and viable way of treating and mitigating the effects of avian coronavirus infections, and raises the possibility that similar effects could be observed in other organisms.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=79 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/336768v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7eb076org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1733722org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@128ad69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19108b0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Through experimental co-infection of IAV with either pseudotyped or SARS-CoV-2 live virus, we found that IAV pre-infection significantly promoted the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in a broad range of cell types. Remarkably, increased SARS-CoV-2 viral load and more severe lung damage were observed in mice co-infected with IAV in vivo. Moreover, such enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity was not seen with several other viruses probably due to a unique IAV segment as an inducer to elevate ACE2 expression. This study illustrates that IAV has a special nature to aggravate SARS-CoV-2 infection, and prevention of IAV is of great significance during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "The international SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has resulted in an urgent need to identify new anti-viral drugs for treatment of COVID-19 patients. The initial step to identifying potential candidates usually involves in vitro screening. Here we describe a simple rapid bioassay for drug screening using Vero E6 cells and inhibition of cytopathic effects (CPE) measured using crystal violet staining. The assay clearly illustrated the anti-viral activity of remdesivir, a drug known to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. A key refinement involves a simple growth assay to identify drug concentrations that cause cellular stress or \"cytomorbidity\", as distinct from cytotoxicity or loss of viability. For instance, hydroxychloroquine shows anti-viral activity at concentrations that slow cell growth, arguing that its purported in vitro anti-viral activity arises from non-specific impairment of cellular activities.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an ongoing global public crisis. Although viral RNA modification has been reported based on the transcriptome architecture, the types and functions of RNA modification are still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the roles of RNA N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification in SARS-CoV-2. Our methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-Seq) analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA contained m6A modification. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection not only increased the expression of methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) but also altered its distribution. Modification of METTL3 expression by short hairpin RNA or plasmid transfection for knockdown or overexpression, respectively, affected viral replication. Furthermore, the viral key protein RdRp interacted with METTL3, and METTL3 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in the presence of RdRp. RdRp appeared to modulate the sumoylation and ubiquitination of METTL3 via an unknown mechanism. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that the host m6A modification complex interacted with viral proteins to modulate SARS-CoV-2 replication.",

    "abstract": "While molecules that promote the growth of animal cells have been identified, the following question remains: How are growth promoting pathways regulated to specify a characteristic size for each of the different cell types? In 1975, Hartwell and Nurse suggested that in eukaryotes, cell size is determined by size checkpoints - mechanisms that restrict cell cycle progression from cells that are smaller than their target size. Curiously, such checkpoint mechanisms imply a conceptual distinction between a cells actual size and cells target size. In the present study, we materialize this conceptual distinction by describing experimental assays that discriminately quantify a cells target size value. With these assays, we show that a cells size and target size are distinct phenotypes that are subject to different upstream regulators. While mTORC1 promotes growth in cell size, our data suggests that a cells target size value is regulated by other pathways including FGFR3, ROCK2, and CDK4. For example, while rapamycin (an mTORC1 inhibitor) decreases cell size, rapamycin does not change the target size that is required for the G1/S transition. The CDK4/Rb pathway has been previously proposed as a putative regulator of target size. Yet, in lacking experimental means that discriminate perturbations of cell growth from perturbations that reprogram target size, such claims on target size were not validated. To investigate the functions of CDK4 in target size determination, we used genetic and chemical means to  dial higher and lower levels of CDK4 activity. These measurements identified functions of CDK4 on target size that are distinct from other G1 CDKs. Using C. elegans, we further demonstrate that these influences of CDK4 on size determination function in vivo. Finally, we propose a model whereby mTORC1, p38, and CDK4 cooperate in a manner that is analogous to the function of a thermostat. While mTORC1 promotes cellular growth as prompted by p38, CDK4 is analogous to the thermostat dial that sets the critical target size associated with cell size homeostasis.",

Deletion of either gene in the mouse results in subtle neuroanatomical anomalies yet overt deficits in spatial learning and memory. Despite their role in neuronal form and function, the identity of few TRIM9 or TRIM67 substrates are known. Here we performed ubiquitin remnant profiling approach in cultured wildtype and knockout murine embryonic cortical neurons to identify ubiquitylated peptides and proteins, with the ultimate goal of identifying substrates of TRIM9 and TRIM67 that exhibited reduced ubiquitylation in the absence of the ligase.

However, the roadmap of chondrocyte divergent differentiation to bone and articular cartilage has yet to be established. Epiphysis possesses articular cartilage, growth plate and the secondary ossification center (SOC), making it an ideal model to uncover the trajectory of chondrocyte divergent differentiation. Here, we mapped differentiation trajectory of human chondrocyte during postnatal finger epiphysis development by using single-cell RNA sequencing. Our results uncovered that chondroprogenitors have two differentiation pathways to hypertrophic chondrocytes during ossification, and one pathway to articular chondrocytes for formation of cartilages. Interestingly, we found that, as an addition to the known typical endochondral ossification path from resting, proliferative to hypertrophic chondrocytes, there was a bypass by which chondroprogenitors differentiate into hypertrophic chondrocytes without proliferative stage. Furthermore, our results revealed two new chondrocyte subpopulations (bypass chondrocytes as it appeared in the ossification bypass, and ID1+ chondroblasts in articular chondrocyte path) during postnatal epiphysis development in addition to six well-known subpopulations. Overall, our study provides a comprehensive roadmap of chondrocyte differentiation in human epiphysis thereby expanding the knowledge of bone and articular cartilage, which could be utilized to design biotherapeutics for bone and articular cartilage regeneration.",

At the genetic level, we are beginning to appreciate that the re-use of the same genes in adaptation occurs through different mechanisms and can be constrained by underlying trait architectures and demographic characteristics of natural populations. Here, we explore these processes in naturally adapted high- (HP) and low-predation (LP) populations of the Trinidadian guppy, Poecilia reticulata. As a model for phenotypic change this system provided some of the earliest evidence of rapid and repeatable evolution in vertebrates; the genetic basis of which has yet to be studied at the whole-genome level. We collected whole-genome sequencing data from ten populations (176 individuals) representing five independent HP-LP river pairs across the three main drainages in Northern Trinidad. We evaluate population structure, uncovering several LP bottlenecks and variable between-river introgression that can lead to constraints on the sharing of adaptive variation between populations. Consequently, we found limited selection on common genes or loci across all drainages. Using a pathway type analysis, however, we find evidence of repeated selection on different genes involved in cadherin signalling. Finally, we found a large repeatedly selected haplotype on chromosome 20 in three rivers from the same drainage. Taken together, despite limited sharing of adaptive variation among rivers, we found evidence of convergent evolution associated with HP-LP environments in pathways across divergent drainages and at a previously unreported candidate haplotype within a drainage.",

Here we introduce the EnvRtype R package, a novel toolkit developed to interplay large-scale envirotyping data (enviromics) into quantitative genomics. To start a user-friendly envirotyping pipeline, this package offers: (1) remote sensing tools for collecting (get_weather and extract_GIS functions) and processing ecophysiological variables (processWTH function) from raw environmental data at single locations or worldwide; (2) environmental characterization by typing environments and profiling descriptors of environmental quality (env_typing function), in addition to gathering environmental covariables as quantitative descriptors for predictive purposes (W_matrix function); and (3) identification of environmental similarity that can be used as an enviromic-based kernel (env_typing function) in whole-genome prediction (GP), aimed at increasing ecophysiological knowledge in genomic best-unbiased predictions (GBLUP) and emulating reaction norm effects (get_kernel and kernel_model functions). We highlight literature mining concepts in fine-tuning envirotyping parameters for each plant species and target growing environments. We show that envirotyping for predictive breeding collects raw data and processes it in an eco-physiologically-smart way. Examples of its use for creating global-scale envirotyping networks and integrating reaction-norm modeling in GP are also outlined. We conclude that EnvRtype provides a cost-effective envirotyping pipeline capable of providing high quality enviromic data for a diverse set of genomic-based studies, especially for increasing accuracy in GP across untested growing environments.",

    "abstract": "6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is widely used in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and its cytotoxicity is primarily mediated by thioguanine nucleotide metabolites (TGN). Recent genome-wide association study has identified germline polymorphisms (e.g., rs72846714) in the NT5C2 gene associated with 6-MP metabolism in patients with ALL. However, the full spectrum of genetic variation in NT5C2 is unclear and its impact on 6-MP drug activation has not been comprehensively examined. To this end, we performed targeted sequencing of NT5C2 in 588 children with ALL and identified 121 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) nominally associated with erythrocyte TGN during 6-MP treatment (P < 0.05). Of these, 61 variants were validated in a replication cohort of 372 children with ALL. After considering linkage disequilibrium and multivariate analysis, we confirmed two clusters of variants, represented by rs72846714 and rs58700372, that independently affected 6-MP metabolism. Functional studies showed that rs58700372 directly altered the activity of an intronic enhancer, with the variant allele linked to higher transcription activity and reduced 6-MP metabolism (lower TGN). By contrast, rs72846714 was not located in a regulatory element and instead its association signal was explained by linkage disequilibrium with a proximal functional variant rs12256506 that activated NT5C2 transcription in-cis. Our results indicated that NT5C2 germline variation significantly contributes to inter-patient variability in thiopurine drug disposition.",

We developed an in-tissue barcoding approach namely DBiT-seq for spatially revolved whole transcriptome sequencing at cellular level, which required no tissue dissociation or RNA exaction, thus potentially more suited for FFPE samples. Herein, we demonstrated spatial transcriptome sequencing of embryonic and adult mouse FFPE tissue sections at cellular level (25m pixel size) with high coverage (>1,000 genes per pixel). Spatial transcriptome of an E10.5 mouse embryo identified all major anatomical features in the brain and abdominal region. Integration with singlecell RNA-seq data for cell type identification indicated that most tissue pixels were dominated by single-cell transcriptional phenotype. Spatial mapping of adult mouse aorta, atrium, and ventricle tissues identified the spatial distribution of a variety of cell types. Spatial transcriptome sequencing of FFPE samples at cellular level may provide enormous opportunities in a wide range of biomedical research.

    "abstract": "During the late phase of HIV-1 infection, viral Gag polyproteins are targeted to the plasma membrane (PM) for assembly. Gag localization at the PM is a prerequisite for the incorporation of the envelope protein (Env) into budding particles. Gag assembly and Env incorporation are mediated by the N-terminal myristoylated matrix (MA) domain of Gag. Nonconservative mutations in the trimer interface of MA (A45E, T70R, and L75G) were found to impair Env incorporation and infectivity, leading to the hypothesis that MA trimerization is an obligatory step for Env incorporation. Conversely, Env incorporation can be rescued by a compensatory mutation in the MA trimer interface (Q63R). The impact of these MA mutations on the structure and trimerization properties of MA is not known. In this study, we employed NMR spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, and sedimentation techniques to characterize the structure and trimerization properties of HIV-1 MA A45E, Q63R, T70R, and L75G mutant proteins. NMR data revealed that these point mutations did not alter the overall structure and folding of MA but caused minor structural perturbations in the trimer interface. Analytical ultracentrifugation data indicated that mutations had a minimal effect on the MA monomer-trimer equilibrium. The high-resolution x-ray structure of the unmyristoylated MA Q63R protein revealed hydrogen bonding between the side chains of Arg-63 and Ser-67 located in the center of the trimer interface, providing the first structural evidence for a stabilization of the trimer form. These findings advance our knowledge of the interplay of MA trimerization and Env incorporation into HIV-1 particles.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by a virus known as SARS-Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2). Without a targeted-medicine, this disease has been causing a massive humanitarian crisis not only in terms of mortality, but also imposing a lasting damage to social life and economic progress of humankind. Therefore, an immediate therapeutic strategy needs to be intervened to mitigate this global crisis. Here, we report a novel KepTide (Knock-End Peptide) therapy that nullifies SARS-CoV2 infection. SARS-CoV2 employs its surface glycoprotein \"spike\" (S-glycoprotein) to interact with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for its infection in host cells. Based on our in-silico-based homology modeling study validated with a recent X-ray crystallographic structure (PDB ID:6M0J), we have identified that a conserved motif of S-glycoprotein that intimately engages multiple hydrogen-bond (H-bond) interactions with ACE-2 enzyme. Accordingly, we designed a peptide, termed as ACIS (ACE-2 Inhibitory motif of Spike), that displayed significant affinity towards ACE-2 enzyme as confirmed by biochemical assays such as BLItz and fluorescence polarization assays. Interestingly, more than one biochemical modifications were adopted in ACIS in order to enhance the inhibitory action of ACIS and hence called as KEpTide. Consequently, a monolayer invasion assay, plaque assay and dual immunofluorescence analysis further revealed that KEpTide efficiently mitigated the infection of SARS-CoV2 in vitro in VERO E6 cells. Finally, evaluating the relative abundance of ACIS in lungs and the potential side-effects in vivo in mice, our current study discovers a novel KepTide therapy that is safe, stable, and robust to attenuate the infection of SARS-CoV2 virus if administered intranasally.",

    "abstract": "Whole Genome Sequence (WGS) data from bacterial species is used for a variety of applications ranging from basic microbiological research, diagnostics, and epidemiological surveillance. The availability of WGS data from hundreds of thousands of individual isolates of individual microbial species poses a tremendous opportunity for discovery and hypothesis-generating research into ecology and evolution of these microorganisms. Scalability and user-friendliness of existing pipelines for population-scale inquiry, however, limit applications of systematic, population-scale approaches. Here, we present ProkEvo, an automated, scalable, and open-source framework for bacterial population genomics analyses using WGS data. ProkEvo was specifically developed to achieve the following goals: 1) Automation and scaling of complex combinations of computational analyses for many thousands of bacterial genomes from inputs of raw Illumina paired-end sequence reads; 2) Use of workflow management systems (WMS) such as Pegasus WMS to ensure reproducibility, scalability, modularity, fault-tolerance, and robust file management throughout the process; 3) Use of high-performance and high-throughput computational platforms; 4) Generation of hierarchical population-based genotypes at different scales of resolution based on combinations of multi-locus and Bayesian statistical approaches for classification; 5) Detection of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes, putative virulence factors, and plasmids from curated databases and association with genotypic classifications; and 6) Production of pan-genome annotations and data compilation that can be utilized for downstream analysis. The scalability of ProkEvo was measured with two datasets comprising significantly different numbers of input genomes (one with ~2,400 genomes, and the second with ~23,000 genomes). Depending on the dataset and the computational platform used, the running time of ProkEvo varied from ~3-26 days. ProkEvo can be used with virtually any bacterial species and the Pegasus WMS facilitates addition or removal of programs from the workflow or modification of options within them. All the dependencies of ProkEvo can be distributed via conda environment or Docker image. To demonstrate versatility of the ProkEvo platform, we performed population-based analyses from available genomes of three distinct pathogenic bacterial species as individual case studies (three serovars of Salmonella enterica, as well as Campylobacter jejuni and Staphylococcus aureus). The specific case studies used reproducible Python and R scripts documented in Jupyter Notebooks and collectively illustrate how hierarchical analyses of population structures, genotype frequencies, and distribution of specific gene functions can be used to generate novel hypotheses about the evolutionary history and ecological characteristics of specific populations of each pathogen. Collectively, our study shows that ProkEvo presents a viable option for scalable, automated analyses of bacterial populations with powerful applications for basic microbiology research, clinical microbiological diagnostics, and epidemiological surveillance.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus which has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. Other known coronaviruses show a strong pattern of seasonality, with the infection cases in humans being more prominent in winter. Although several plausible origins of such seasonal variability have been proposed, its mechanism is unclear. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via airborne droplets ejected from the upper respiratory tract of the infected individuals. It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for hours on surfaces. As such, the stability of viral particles both in liquid droplets as well as dried on surfaces is essential for infectivity. Here we have used atomic force microscopy to examine the structural stability of individual SARS-CoV-2 virus like particles at different temperatures. We demonstrate that even a mild temperature increase, commensurate with what is common for summer warming, leads to dramatic disruption of viral structural stability, especially when the heat is applied in the dry state. This is consistent with other existing non-mechanistic studies of viral infectivity, provides a single particle perspective on viral seasonality, and strengthens the case for a resurgence of COVID-19 in winter.\n\nStatement of Scientific SignificanceThe economic and public health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are very significant. However scientific information needed to underpin policy decisions are limited partly due to novelty of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogen. There is therefore an urgent need for mechanistic studies of both COVID-19 disease and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We show that individual virus particles suffer structural destabilization at relatively mild but elevated temperatures. Our nanoscale results are consistent with recent observations at larger scales. Our work strengthens the case for COVID-19 resurgence in winter.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel, fully three-dimensional approach to soft material characterization and constitutive modeling with relevance to soft biological tissue. Our approach leverages recent advances in experimental techniques and data-driven computation. The experimental component of this approach involves in situ mechanical loading in a magnetic field (using MRI), yielding the entire deformation tensor field throughout the specimen regardless of the possible irregularities in its three-dimensional shape. Characterization can therefore be accomplished with data at a reduced number of deformation states. We refer to this experimental technique as MR-u. Its combination with powerful approaches to inverse modelling, specifically methods of model inference, would open the door to insightful mechanical characterization for soft materials. In recent computational advances that answer this need, we have developed new, data-driven inverse techniques to infer the model that best explains the physics governing observed phenomena from a spectrum of admissible ones, while maintaining parsimony of representation. This approach is referred to as Variational System Identification (VSI). In this communication, we apply the MR-u approach to characterize soft polymers regarding them as surrogates of soft biological tissue, and using VSI, we infer the physically best-suited and parsimonious mathematical models of their mechanical response. We demonstrate the performance of our methods in the face of noisy data with physical constraints that challenge the identification of mathematical models, while attaining high accuracy in the predicted response of the inferred models.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) tumorigenesis and progression are linked to common oncogenic mutations, especially in the tumor suppressor APC, whose loss triggers the deregulation of TCF4/{beta}-Catenin activity. CRC tumorigenesis is also driven by multiple epi-mutational modifiers, such as transcriptional regulators. We describe the common (and near-universal) activation of the zinc finger transcription factor and Let-7 target PLAGL2 in CRC and find that it is a key driver of intestinal epithelial transformation. PLAGL2 drives proliferation, cell cycle progression, and anchorage-independent growth in CRC cell lines and non-transformed intestinal cells. Investigating effects of PLAGL2 on downstream pathways revealed very modest effects on canonical Wnt signaling. Alternatively, we find pronounced effects on the direct PLAGL2 target genes IGF2, a fetal growth factor, and ASCL2, an intestinal stem cell-specific bHLH transcription factor. Inactivation of PLAGL2 in CRC cell lines has pronounced effects on ASCL2 reporter activity. Furthermore, ASCL2 expression can partially rescue deficits of proliferation and cell cycle progression caused by depletion of PLAGL2 in CRC cell lines. Thus, the oncogenic effects of PLAGL2 appear to be mediated via core stem cell and onco-fetal pathways, with minimal effects on downstream Wnt signaling.",

    "abstract": "Circumventing chemoresistance is crucial for effectively treating glioblastoma due to limited therapeutic options. The gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) renders glioblastoma resistant to the frontline chemotherapy temozolomide; however, targeting Cx43 is difficult because mechanisms underlying Cx43-mediated chemoresistance remain elusive. Here we show that Cx43, but not other connexins, is highly expressed in glioblastoma and strongly correlates with poor patient prognosis and chemoresistance, making Cx43 the prime therapeutic target among all connexins. The intracellular carboxyl terminus of Cx43 binds to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic subunit {beta} (PIK3CB, also called PI3K{beta} or p110{beta}), thereby activating PI3K signaling independent of Cx43-channels and subsequently inducing temozolomide resistance. A combination of CT1, a Cx43-targeting peptide inhibitor, and PIK3CB-selective inhibitors restores temozolomide sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. This study not only reveals novel mechanistic insights into chemoresistance in glioblastoma, but also demonstrates that targeting Cx43 and PIK3CB/p110{beta} is an effective approach for overcoming chemoresistance.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeCurrently, no effective drug exists to treat cocaine use disorders, which affect millions of people worldwide. Benzodiazepines are potential therapeutic candidates, as microdialysis and voltammetry studies have shown that they can decrease dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens of rodents. In addition, we have recently shown that diazepam blocks the increase in dopamine release and the affective marker 50-kHz ultrasonic vocalizations (USV) induced by DL-amphetamine in rats.\n\nExperimental ApproachHere we tested whether administration of 2.5 mg{middle dot}kg-1 diazepam (i.p.) in adult male Wistar rats could block the effects of 20 mg{middle dot}kg-1 cocaine (i.p.) on electrically evoked phasic dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, as well as 50-kHz USV and locomotor activity.\n\nKey ResultsCocaine injection increased evoked dopamine release up to 3-fold within 5 min and the increase was significantly higher than baseline for at least 90 min. The injection of diazepam 15 min later attenuated the cocaine effect by nearly 50% and this attenuation was maintained for at least 30 min. Stimulant drugs, natural rewards and reward predictive cues are known to evoke 50-kHz USV in adult rats. In the present study, cocaine increased the number of 50-kHz USV of the flat, step, trill, and mixed kinds by 12-fold. This effect was at maximum 5 min after cocaine injection, decreased with time and lasted at least 40 min. Diazepam significantly blocked this effect for the entire duration of the session. The distance travelled by control rats during a 40-min session of exploration in an open field was at maximum in the first 5 min and decayed progressively until the end of the session. Cocaine-treated rats travelled significantly longer distances when compared to the control group, while diazepam significantly attenuated cocaine-induced locomotion by up to 50%.\n\nConclusions and implicationThese results suggest that the neurochemical, affective, and stimulant effects of cocaine can be mitigated by diazepam.\n\nWhat is already knownO_LIDiazepam decreases dopamine release in the rodent nucleus accumbens (NAc) and reduces some effects produced by DL-amphetamine.\nC_LI\n\nWhat this study addsO_LIDiazepam attenuated the increase in phasic dopamine release caused by cocaine.\nC_LIO_LIDiazepam blocked the effect of cocaine on 50-kHz USV and locomotor activity.\nC_LI\n\nClinical significanceO_LIThis study demonstrates that diazepam can block specific effects of cocaine that likely contribute to addiction.\nC_LI",

The host-cell receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and the type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are important for viral cell entry. It is unclear whether obesity alters expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 in the lower respiratory tract. Here, we show that: 1) Ace2 expression is elevated in the lung and trachea of diet-induced obese male mice and reduced in the esophagus of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 2) Tmprss2 expression is increased in the trachea of obese male mice but reduced in the lung and elevated in the trachea of obese female mice relative to lean controls; 3) in chow-fed lean mice, females have higher expression of Ace2 in the lung and esophagus as well as higher Tmprss2 expression in the lung but lower expression in the trachea compared to males; and 4) in diet-induced obese mice, males have higher expression of Ace2 in the trachea and higher expression of Tmprss2 in the lung compared to females, whereas females have higher expression of Tmprss2 in the trachea relative to males. Our data indicate diet- and sex-dependent modulation of Ace2 and Tmprss2 expression in the lower respiratory tract and esophagus. Given the high prevalence of obesity worldwide and a sex-biased mortality rate, we discuss the implications and relevance of our results for COVID-19.",

Novel synthetic mRNA and vector-based vaccine technologies offer an expeditious development path alternative to traditional vaccine approaches. Here we describe the efforts to utilize an mRNA platform for rational design and evaluations of mRNA vaccine candidates based on Spike (S) glycoprotein of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus causing COVID-19. Several mRNA constructs expressing various structural conformations of S-protein, including wild type (WT), a pre-fusion stabilized mutant (2P), a furin cleavage-site mutant (GSAS) and a double mutant form (2P/GSAS), were tested in a preclinical animal model for their capacity to elicit neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). The lead 2P/GSAS candidate was further assessed in dose-ranging studies in mice and Cynomolgus macaques. The selected 2P/GSAS vaccine formulation, now designated MRT5500, elicited potent nAbs as measured in two types of neutralization assays. In addition, MRT5500 elicited TH1-biased responses in both mouse and non-human primate species, a result that helps to address a hypothetical concern regarding potential vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory diseases associated with TH2-biased responses. These data position MRT5500 as a viable vaccine candidate for clinical development against COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is responsible for Covid-19 pandemic. In the early phase of infection, the single-strand positive RNA genome is translated into non-structural proteins (NSP). One of the first proteins produced during viral infection, NSP1, binds to the host ribosome and blocks the mRNA entry channel. This triggers translation inhibition of cellular translation. In spite of the presence of NSP1 on the ribosome, viral translation proceeds however. The molecular mechanism of the so-called viral evasion to NSP1 inhibition remains elusive. Here, we confirm that viral translation is maintained in the presence of NSP1. The evasion to NSP1-inhibition is mediated by the cis-acting RNA hairpin SL1 in the 5UTR of SARS-CoV-2. NSP1-evasion can be transferred on a reporter transcript by SL1 transplantation. The apical part of SL1 is only required for viral translation. We show that NSP1 remains bound on the ribosome during viral translation. We suggest that the interaction between NSP1 and SL1 frees the mRNA accommodation channel while maintaining NSP1 bound to the ribosome. Thus, NSP1 acts as a ribosome gatekeeper, shutting down host translation or fostering SARS-CoV-2 translation depending on the presence of the SL1 5UTR hairpin. SL1 is also present and necessary for translation of sub-genomic RNAs in the late phase of the infectious program. Consequently, therapeutic strategies targeting SL1 should affect viral translation at early and late stages of infection. Therefore, SL1 might be seen as a genuine  Achille heel of the virus.",

    "abstract": "Cell screening and viability studies are paramount to access cell morphology and intracellular molecular variations within large heterogeneous populations of cells. This forms the basis for diagnosis of infections, evaluating immunohistochemistry and routine histopathology. The proposed volume flow cytometry (also termed as, parallel Integrated Light-sheet imaging and flow-based enquiry (parallel-iLIFE)) is a powerful method that adds new capabilities (3D volume visualization, organelle-level resolution and multi-organelle screening) powered by light sheet based illumination. Unlike state-of-the-art point-illumination based imaging cytometry techniques, light sheet based parallel-iLIFE technique is capable of screening species with high throughput and near diffraction-limited resolution. The flow system was realized on a multichannel (Y-type) microfluidic chip that enables visualization of mitochondrial network of several cells in-parallel at a relatively high flow-rate of 2000 nl/min. The calibration of system requires study of point emitters (fluorescent beads) at physiologically relevant flow-rates (50-2000 nl/min) for determining flow-induced optical aberration in the system point spread function (PSF). Subsequently, recorded raw images and volumes were deconvolved with flow-variant PSF to reconstruct cellular mitochondrial network. High throughput investigation of HeLa cells were carried out at sub-cellular resolution in real-time and critical parameters (mitochondria count and size distribution, morphology and cell strain statistics) are determined on-the-go. These parameters determine the physiological state of cells and the changes in mitochondrial distribution over-time that may have consequences in disease diagnosis. The development of volume flow cytometry system (parallel-iLIFE) and its suitability to study sub-cellular components at high-throughput high-content capacity with organelle-level resolution may enable disease diagnosis on a single microfluidic chip.",

Here, we present a single sample to calibrate microscopes, align their laser beams and measure their point spread function (PSF) in 3D. The sample is composed of a refractive index matched colloidal crystal of silica beads with fluorescent and gold cores. The microscope can be calibrated in three dimensions using the periodicity of the crystal; the alignment of the laser beams can be checked using the reflection of the gold cores; and the PSF can be measured at multiple positions and depths using the fluorescent cores. It is demonstrated how this sample can be used to visualize and improve the quality of confocal and super-resolution images. The sample is adjustable to meet the requirements of different NA objectives and microscopy techniques and additionally can be used to evaluate refractive index mismatches as a function of depth quantitatively.",

    "abstract": "Viruses pose a constant threat to human health. As a result our innate immune system has evolved multiple strategies to detect the presence of intracellular viral  pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (1). The full repertoire of human immune sensors and their PAMP ligands are not completely understood. Here we report that human NLRP1 senses and is activated by 3C proteases (3Cpros) of enteroviruses. Mechanistically, 3Cpros cleave human NLRP1 at a single site immediately after its primate-specific PYRIN domain, leading to oligomerization of its C-terminal fragment. Expression of 3Cpros in primary human cells cause NLRP1-dependent ASC oligomerization, pyroptotic cell death and IL-1 secretion. Consistent with our observation that NLRP1 is the predominant endogenous inflammasome sensor in human airway epithelium, we find that its genetic deletion, or that of ASC, abrogates IL-18 secretion from rhinovirus (HRV)-infected primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Our findings identify the first cognate PAMP ligand for human NLRP1 and assign a new function for the NLRP1 inflammasome in human antiviral immunity and airway inflammation. These results challenge the widely held notion that viral proteases largely serve to disable host immune sensing, and suggest that the human NLRP1 inflammasome may be a therapeutic target to treat inflammatory airway diseases including asthma.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHuman NLRP1 is activated by enteroviral 3C proteases",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in community assembly theory, uncertainties remain regarding how ecological and evolutionary processes shape species distributions and communities. We analyzed patterns of occurrence for 139 herbaceous plant species across 257 forest stands in Wisconsin (USA) to test predictions from community assembly theory. Specifically, we applied Bayesian phylogenetic linear mixed effects models (PGLMMs) to examine how functional traits and phylogenetic relationships influence plant distributions along environmental gradients and how functional similarity and phylogenetic relatedness affect local species co-occurrence. Leaf height, specific leaf area, and seed mass mediate species distributions along edaphic, climatic, and light gradients. In contrast, functional trait similarity and phylogenetic relationships only weakly affect patterns of local co-occurrence. These results confirm that broad-scale plant distributions are largely shaped by ecological sorting along environmental gradients but suggest deterministic assembly rules based on niche differentiation and complementary resource use may not govern local species co-occurrence in homogeneous environments.\n\nStatement of authorshipJB conceived the idea for the study.

    "abstract": "Studying the development of fitness related traits in hybrids from populations diverging in sympatry is a fundamental approach to understand the processes of speciation. However, such traits are often affected by covariance structures that complicate the comprehension of these processes, especially because the interactive relationships between traits of different nature (e.g. morphology, behaviour, life-history) remain largely unknown in this context. In a common garden setup, we conducted an extensive examination of phenotypic traits suspected to be involved in the divergence of two recently evolved morphs of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus), and investigated the consequences of potential patterns of trait covariance on the phenotype of their hybrids. We observed differences among morphs in overall phenotypic variance and in trait correlations. Phenotypic contrainsts also tended to be reduced in the hybrids, which corroborates the narrative of hybridization facilitating adaptive divergence by relaxing trait covariance. However, the hybrids were associated with reduced phenotypic variance at different scales (i.e. at the scale of the entire P matrix and in different parts of the multivariate space), and we identified stronger correlations between several ontogenetic and morphological traits in the hybrids than in both morphs. These findings suggest a limited potential for hybridization to generate phenotypic novelty, and emphasise the need for multivariate approaches conciliating ontogenetic, morphological and behavioural processes to study the processes of adaptive divergence and speciation.",

ENDOD1 is enriched in the nucleus following H2O2 treatment and ENDOD1-/- cells show increased PARP chromatin-association. Loss of ENDOD1 function is synthetic lethal with homologous recombination defects, with affected cells accumulating DNA double strand breaks. Remarkably, we also uncover an additional synthetic lethality between ENDOD1 and p53. ENDOD1 depletion in TP53 mutated tumour cells, or p53 depletion in ENDOD1-/- cells, results in rapid single stranded DNA accumulation and cell death. Because TP53 is mutated in [~]50% of tumours, ENDOD1 has potential as a wide-spectrum target for synthetic lethal treatments. To support this we demonstrate that systemic knockdown of mouse EndoD1 is well tolerated and whole-animal siRNA against human ENDOD1 restrains TP53 mutated tumour progression in xenograft models.

    "abstract": "IL-13 plays a key role during protective type 2 immune responses at mucosal sites, such as during infection with nematodes. However, dysregulation of IL-13 can also contribute to the pathogenesis of atopic and fibrotic diseases such as allergic asthma. Matrix remodelling is an important component of repair processes in the lung but also a hallmark of chronic conditions involving fibrosis. Hence, understanding the role of IL-13 in tissue remodelling has important clinical implications. Since IL-13 shares receptors and signalling pathways with IL-4, disentangling the relative contributions of these type 2 cytokines has been challenging. Additionally, little is known about the singular role of IL-13 following acute tissue injury. In this study, we used Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection as a model of acute lung tissue damage comparing responses between WT and IL-13-deficient mice, in which IL-4 signalling is intact. Importantly, we found that IL-13 played a critical role in limiting tissue injury and haemorrhaging in the lung following infection. Through proteomic and transcriptomic profiling, we identified IL-13-dependent changes in matrix and associated regulators. We further showed that IL-13 is required for the induction of epithelial-derived type 2 effector molecules such as RELM- and surfactant protein D. Pathway analyses predicted that IL-13 was heavily involved in the induction of cellular stress responses and regulation of lung epithelial cell differentiation by suppression of Foxa2 pathways. Thus, we propose that IL-13 has tissue-protective functions during lung injury and regulates epithelial cell responses during type 2 immunity in this acute setting.",

Here, we assessed the efficacy of convalescent sera in a newly developed African green monkey model of COVID-19. Groups of SARS-CoV-2-infected animals were treated with pooled convalescent sera containing either high or low to moderate anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody titers. Differences in viral load and disease pathology were minimal between monkeys that received the lower titer convalescent sera and untreated controls. However, and importantly, lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory compartments, reduced gross and histopathological lesion severity in the lungs, and reductions in several parameters associated with coagulation and inflammatory processes were observed in monkeys that received convalescent sera versus untreated controls. Our data support human studies suggesting that convalescent plasma therapy is an effective strategy if donors with high level of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are employed and if recipients are at an early stage of disease.",

The antibacterial MSCs respond rapidly to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and have elevated levels of the LPS co-receptor CD14. CRISPR-mediated overexpression of endogenous CD14 in non-antibacterial MSCs resulted in faster LPS response and enhanced antimicrobial activity. Single-cell transcriptome profiling of CD14-activated MSCs revealed uniform enhancement of LPS response kinetics, and a shift in the ground state of these MSCs. Our results demonstrate that systems-level analysis can reveal critical molecular targets to optimize desirable properties in MSCs, and that overexpression of CD14 in these cells can shift their state to be more responsive to future bacterial challenge.",

    "abstract": "While neural crest development is known to be transcriptionally controlled via sequential activation of gene regulatory networks (GRNs), recent evidence increasingly implicates a role for post-transcriptional regulation in modulating the output of these regulatory circuits. Using available single cell RNA-sequencing datasets from avian embryos to identify potential post-transcriptional regulators, we found that Elavl1, which encodes for an RNA-binding protein with roles in transcript stability, was enriched in the premigratory cranial neural crest. Perturbation of Elavl1 resulted in premature neural crest delamination from the neural tube as well as significant reduction in transcripts associated with the neural crest specification GRN, phenotypes that are also observed with downregulation of the canonical Wnt inhibitor Draxin. That Draxin is the primary target for stabilization by Elavl1 during cranial neural crest specification was shown by RNA-sequencing, RNA-immunoprecipitation, RNA decay measurement and proximity ligation assays, further supporting the idea that the downregulation of neural crest specifier expression upon Elavl1 knockdown was largely due to loss of Draxin. Importantly, exogenous Draxin rescued cranial neural crest specification defects observed with Elavl1 knockdown. Thus, Elavl1 plays a critical a role in the maintenance of cranial neural crest specification via Draxin mRNA stabilization. Together, these data highlight an important intersection of post-transcriptional regulation with modulation of the neural crest specification GRN.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional deregulation is a common feature of many cancers, which is often accompanied by changes in epigenetic controls. These findings have led to the development of therapeutic agents aimed at broad modulation and reprogramming of transcription in a variety of cancers. Histone Deacetylase 3, HDAC3, is one of the main targets of HDAC inhibitors currently in clinical development as cancer therapies, yet the in vivo role of HDAC3 in solid tumors is unknown. Here, we define the role of HDAC3 in two genetic engineered models of the most common subtypes of Kras-driven Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC), KrasG12D, STK11-/- (KL) and KrasG12D, p53-/- (KP), where we found that HDAC3 is strongly required for tumor growth of both genotypes in vivo. Transcriptional profiling and mechanistic studies revealed that HDAC3 represses p65 NF-{kappa}B-mediated induction of the Senescence Associated Secretory Program (SASP) and HDAC3 binds directly at the promoters of SASP CXC chemokines. Additionally, HDAC3 was found to cooperate with the lung cancer lineage transcription factor NKX2-1 to mediate expression of a common set of target genes. Leveraging observations about one HDAC3/NKX2-1 common target, FGFR1, we identified that an HDAC3-dependent transcriptional cassette becomes hyperactivated as Kras mutant cancer cells develop resistance to the MEK inhibitor Trametinib, and this can be rescued by treatment with the Class I HDAC inhibitor Entinostat. These unexpected findings reveal new roles for HDAC3 in proliferation control in tumors in vivo and identify specific therapeutic contexts for the utilization of HDAC3 inhibitors, whose ability to mechanistically induce SASP may be harnessed therapeutically.",

    "abstract": "The THOUSAND-GRAIN WEIGHT 6 genes (TaTGW6 and OsTGW6) are reported to result in larger grains of wheat and rice by reducing production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in developing grains. However, a critical comparison of data on TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 with other reports on IAA synthesis in cereal grains requires that this hypothesis be reinvestigated. Here, we show that TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 are members of a large gene family that has undergone major, lineage-specific gene expansion. Wheat has nine genes, and rice three genes encoding proteins with more than 80% amino acid identity with TGW6 making it difficult to envisage how a single inactive allele could have a major effect on IAA levels. TGW6 is proposed to affect auxin levels by catalysing the hydrolysis of IAA-glucose (IAA-Glc). However, we show that developing wheat grains contain undetectable levels of ester IAA in comparison to free IAA and do not express an IAA-glucose synthase. Previous work on TGW6, reported maximal expression at 20 days after anthesis (DAA) in wheat and 2 DAA in rice. However, we show that neither gene is expressed in developing grains. Instead, TaTGW6, OsTGW6 and their close homologues are exclusively expressed in pre-emergence inflorescences; TaTGW6 is expressed particularly in microspores prior to mitosis. This combined with evidence for high levels of IAA production from tryptophan in developing grains demonstrates TaTGW6 and OsTGW6 cannot regulate grain size via the hydrolysis of IAA-Glc. Instead, their similarity to rice strictosidine synthase-like (OsSTRL2) suggests they play a key role in pollen development.",

Genetic variation in stomatal density and canopy temperature was evaluated in the model C4 genus, Setaria. Recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from a Setaria italica x Setaria viridis cross were grown with ample or limiting water supply under field conditions in Illinois. An optical profilometer was used to rapidly assess stomatal patterning and canopy temperature was measured using infrared imaging. Stomatal density and canopy temperature were positively correlated but both were negatively correlated with total above-ground biomass. These trait relationships suggest a likely interaction between stomatal density and the other drivers of water use such as stomatal size and aperture. Multiple QTLs were identified for stomatal density and canopy temperature, including co-located QTLs on chromosomes 5 and 9. The direction of the additive effect of these QTLs on chromosome 5 and 9 were in accordance with the positive phenotypic relationship between these two traits. This suggests a common genetic architecture between stomatal patterning in the greenhouse and canopy transpiration in the field, while highlighting the potential of setaria as a model to understand the physiology and genetics of WUE in C4 species.\n\nHighlightThis article reports a phenotypic and genetic relationship between two water use related traits operating at leaf level and canopy level in a C4 model crop species.",

Research presented here sought to determine if opioid induced tolerance is linked to activity changes within the PI3K{gamma}-AKT-cGMP-JNK intracellular signaling pathway in spinal cord or peripheral nervous systems.\n\nMethodsMorphine or saline injections were given subcutaneously twice a day for five days (15 mg/kg) to male C57Bl6 mice. A separate cohort of mice received spinal nerve ligation (SNL) one week prior to the start of morphine tolerance. Afterwards, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and sciatic nerves were isolated for quantifying total and phosphorylated-JNK levels, cGMP, and gene expression analysis.\n\nResultsGene expression for the PI3K{gamma}-AKT-cGMP-JNK signaling pathway including, Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, Pik3cg, Pten, Jnk3, and nNos1 were decreased in the spinal cord with varied expression changes in the dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve of morphine tolerant and morphine tolerant mice after SNL. We observed significant increases in total and phosphorylated-JNK levels in the spinal cord, total JNK in dorsal root ganglia, and cGMP in the sciatic nerve of morphine tolerant mice with SNL. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K, nNOS, or JNK, using thalidomide, quercetin, or SP600125, attenuated the development of morphine tolerance in mice with SNL as measured by thermal paw withdrawal.\n\nConclusionsOverall, the PI3K/AKT intracellular signaling pathway is a potential target for reducing the development of morphine tolerance. Continued research into this pathway will contribute to the development of new analgesic drug therapies.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan pathogen of humans that can cross the placenta and result in adverse pregnancy outcomes and long-term birth defects. The mechanism used by T. gondii to cross the placenta are unknown but complex interactions with the host immune response are likely to play a role in dictating infection outcomes during pregnancy. Prior work showed that T. gondii infection dramatically and specifically increases the secretion of the immunomodulatory chemokine CCL22 in human placental cells during infection.. Given the important role of this chemokine during pregnancy, we hypothesized that CCL22 induction was driven by a specific T. gondii-secreted effector. Using a combination of bioinformatics and molecular genetics, we have now identified T. gondii GRA28 as the gene product required for CCL22 induction. GRA28 is secreted into the host cell where it localizes to the nucleus, and deletion of this gene results in reduced CCL22 placental cells as well as a human monocyte cell line. The impact of GRA28 on CCL22 production is also conserved in mouse immune and placental cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, parasites lacking GRA28 are impaired in their ability to disseminate throughout the animal, suggesting a link between CCL22 induction and the ability of the parasite to cause disease. Overall these data demonstrate a clear function for GRA28 in altering the immunomodulatory landscape during infection of both placental and peripheral immune cells, and show a clear impact of this immunomodulation on infection outcome.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYToxoplasma gondii is a globally ubiquitous pathogen that can cause severe disease in HIV/AIDS patients and can also cross the placenta and infect the developing fetus. We have found that placental and immune cells infected with T. gondii secrete significant amounts of a chemokine (called \"CCL22\") that is critical for immune tolerance during pregnancy. In order to better understand whether this is a response by the host or a process that is driven by the parasite, we have identified a T. gondii gene that is absolutely required to induce CCL22 production in human cells, indicating that CCL22 production is a process driven almost entirely by the parasite rather than the host. Consistent with its role in immune tolerance, we also found that T. gondii parasites lacking this gene are less able to proliferate and disseminate throughout the host. Taken together these data illustrate a direct relationship between CCL22 levels in the infected host and a key parasite effector, and provide an interesting example of how T. gondii can directly modulate host signaling pathways in order to facilitate its growth and dissemination.",

    "abstract": "The Asgard superphylum is a deeply branching monophyletic group of Archaea, recently described as some of the closest relatives of the eukaryotic ancestor. The wide application of genomic analyses from metagenome sequencing has established six distinct phyla, whose genomes encode for diverse metabolic capacities and play important biogeochemical and ecological roles in marine sediments. Here, we describe two metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) recovered from deep marine sediments off Costa Rica margin, defining a novel lineage phylogenetically married to Thorarchaeota, as such we propose the name \"Sifarchaeota\" for this phylum. The two \"Sifarchaeota\" MAGs encode for an anaerobic methylotrophy pathway enabling the utilization of C1-C3 compounds (methanol and methylamines) to synthesize acetyl CoA. Also, the MAGs showed a remarkable saccharolytic capabilities compared to other Asgard lineages and encoded for diverse classes of carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) targeting different mono-, di- and oligosaccharides. Comparative genomic analysis based on the full metabolic profiles of Asgard lineages revealed the close relation between \"Sifarchaeota\" and Odinarchaeota MAGs, which suggested a similar metabolic potentials and ecological roles. Furthermore, we identified multiple potential horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events from different bacterial donors within \"Sifarchaetoa\" MAGs, which hypothetically expanded \"Sifarchaeota\" capacities for substrate utilization, energy production and niche adaptation.\n\nImportanceDeep marine sediments are the home of multiple poorly described archaeal lineages, many of which have ecological and evolutionary importance. We recovered metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to a novel Asgard phylum from the deep sediment of the Costa Rica margin. We proposed the name \"Sifarchaeota\" to describe the members of this phylum. Representative genomes of the \"Sifarchaeota\" showed remarkable saccharolytic capacities extending the known metabolic features encoded by the Asgard lineages. We attribute its ability to survive under the deep sediment conditions to its putative capacities to utilize different (C1-C3) compounds commonly encountered in deep sediment environments via anaerobic methylotrophy pathway. Also, we showed the importance of horizontal gene transfer in enhancing the \"Sifarchaeota\" collective adaptation strategies.",

Unlike most other eukaryotes that have canonical kinetochore proteins, a group of evolutionarily divergent eukaryotes called kinetoplastids (such as Trypanosoma brucei) have a unique set of kinetochore proteins. To date, KKT4 is the only kinetoplastid kinetochore protein that is known to bind microtubules. Here we use X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and crosslinking mass spectrometry to characterise the structure and dynamics of KKT4. We show that its microtubule-binding domain consists of a coiled-coil structure followed by a positively charged disordered tail. The crystal structure of the C-terminal BRCT domain of KKT4 reveals that it is likely a phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interaction domain. The BRCT domain interacts with the N-terminal region of the KKT4 microtubule-binding domain and with a phosphopeptide derived from KKT8. Finally, we show that KKT4 binds DNA with high affinity. Taken together, these results provide the first structural insights into the unconventional kinetoplastid kinetochore protein KKT4.",

Dopaminergic gene expression was indicated by assessing two dopamine receptors (DRD1 and DRD2), DOPA decarboxylase (DDC), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) via quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction at various developmental stages. TH transcript levels started to express around day (D) 42, reached maximal expression [~]D63 and then decreased thereafter. At D29, proliferating retinal progenitors expressed DRD1, DRD2, and DDC at various levels of mRNA throughout the day. In the presence of l-DOPA, D29 retinal organoids expressed DRD1 but DRD2 mRNA expression was suppressed. Additionally, l-DOPA upregulated TH mRNA prior to dopaminergic amacrine cell (DAC) development. After the appearance of DACs, l-DOPA phase shifted expression of DRD2 and synchronized mRNA expression of DDC, DRD2, and TH.

    "abstract": "During the Miocene, Hyaenidae was a highly diverse family of Carnivora that has since been severely reduced to four extant genera, each of which contains only a single species. These species include the bone-cracking spotted, striped, and brown hyenas, and the specialised insectivorous aardwolf. Previous genome studies have analysed the evolutionary histories of the spotted and brown hyenas, but little is known about the remaining two species. Moreover, the genomic underpinnings of scavenging and insectivory, defining traits of the extant species, remain elusive. To tackle these questions, we generated an aardwolf genome and analysed it together with those from the other three species. We provide new insights into the evolutionary relationships between the species, the genomic underpinnings of their scavenging and insectivorous lifestyles, and their respective genetic diversities and demographic histories. High levels of phylogenetic discordance within the family suggest gene flow between the aardwolf lineage and the ancestral brown/striped hyena lineage. Genes related to immunity and digestion in the bone-cracking hyenas and craniofacial development in the aardwolf showed the strongest signals of selection in their respective lineages, suggesting putative key adaptations to carrion or termite feeding. We also found a family-wide expansion in olfactory receptor genes suggesting that an acute sense of smell was a key early adaptation for the Hyaenidae family. Finally, we report very low levels of genetic diversity within the brown and striped hyenas despite no signs of inbreeding, which we putatively link to their similarly slow decline in Neover the last [~]2 million years. We found much higher levels of genetic diversity in both the spotted hyena and aardwolf and more stable population sizes through time. Taken together, these findings highlight how ecological specialisation can impact the evolutionary history, demographics, and adaptive genetic changes of a lineage.",

    "abstract": "Every newborn harbors scores of new single nucleotide variants (SNVs) that may impact health and disease1-4; the majority of these are contributed by the paternal germ cells5. In some cases, these mutations are identifiable in a subset of the parents cells--a phenomenon called mosaicism, which is capable of producing disease recurrence6-8. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of male gonadal mosaic mutations, employing 300x whole genome sequencing (WGS) of blood and sperm in 17 healthy individuals, including assessment across multiple samples and age groups. Approximately 1 in 15 healthy males is predicted to harbor a transmissible, likely pathogenic exonic variant that is mosaic in his sperm. In general, only a third of sperm mosaic mutations were detectable in blood cells, all were remarkably stable over the course of months to years, and 23% were present in 5% or more of sperm cells. There was no evidence of age-dependent clonal expansion or collapse, as seen in hematopoiesis. Thus, despite the observed increase of mutations in offspring of men with advanced paternal age, detectable sperm mosaicism remains stable, represents a life-long transmission risk to offspring, and suggests a testis stem cell niche that prevents widespread clonality.",

    "abstract": "Spliceosomal introns, which interrupt nuclear genes and are removed from RNA transcripts by machinery termed spliceosomes, are ubiquitous features of eukaryotic nuclear genes [1]. Patterns of spliceosomal intron evolution are complex, with some lineages exhibiting virtually no intron creation while others experience thousands of intron gains [2-5]. One possibility is that this punctate phylogenetic distribution is explained by intron creation by Introner-Like Elements (ILEs), transposable elements capable of creating introns, with only those lineages harboring ILEs undergoing massive intron gain [6-10]. However, ILEs have been reported in only four lineages. Here we study intron evolution in dinoflagellates. The remarkable fragmentation of nuclear genes by spliceosomal introns reaches its apex in dinoflagellates, which have some twenty introns per gene [11,12]. Despite this, almost nothing is known about the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms governing dinoflagellate intron evolution. We reconstructed intron evolution in five dinoflagellate genomes, revealing a dynamic history of intron loss and gain. ILEs are found in 4/5 studied species. In one species, Polarella glacialis, we find an unprecedented diversity of ILEs, with ILE insertion leading to creation of some 12,253 introns, and with 15 separate families of ILEs accounting for at least 100 introns each. These ILE families range in mobilization mechanism, mechanism of intron creation, and flexibility of mechanism of intron creation. Comparison within and between ILE families provides evidence that biases in so-called intron phase, the distribution of introns relative to codon periodicity, are driven by ILE insertion site requirements [9,13,14]. Finally, we find evidence for multiple additional transformations of the spliceosomal system in dinoflagellates, including widespread loss of ancestral introns, and alterations in required, tolerated and favored splice motifs. These results reveal unappreciated intron creating elements diversity and spliceosomal evolutionary capacity, and suggest complex evolutionary dependencies shaping genome structures.",

    "abstract": "Radius fractures are among the most common fracture types; however, there is limited consensus on the standard of care. A better understanding of the fracture healing process could help to shape future treatment protocols and thus improve functional outcomes of patients. High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) allows monitoring and evaluation of the radius on the micro-structural level, which is crucial to our understanding of fracture healing. However, current radius fracture studies using HR-pQCT are limited by the lack of automated contouring routines, hence only including small number of patients due to the prohibitively time-consuming task of manually contouring HR-pQCT images.\n\nIn the present study, a new method to automatically contour images of distal radius fractures based on 3D morphological geodesic active contours (3D-GAC) is presented. Contours of 60 HR-pQCT images of fractured and conservatively treated radii spanning the healing process up to one year post-fracture are compared to the current gold standard, hand-drawn 2D contours, to assess the accuracy of the algorithm. Furthermore, robustness was established by applying the algorithm to HR-pQCT images of intact radii of 73 patients and comparing the resulting morphometric indices to the gold standard patient evaluation including a threshold- and dilation-based contouring approach. Reproducibility was evaluated using repeat scans of intact radii of 19 patients.\n\nThe new 3D-GAC approach offers contours within inter-operator variability for images of fractured distal radii (mean Dice score of 0.992 {+/-} 0.004 versus median operator Dice score of 0.993 {+/-} 0.006). The generated contours for images of intact radii yielded morphometric indices within the in vivo reproducibility limits compared to the current gold standard. Additionally, the 3D-GAC approach shows an improved robustness against failure (n = 4) when dealing with cortical interruptions, fracture fragments, etc. compared with the automatic, default manufacturer pipeline (n = 40). Using the 3D-GAC approach assures consistent results, while reducing the need for time-consuming hand-contouring.",

    "abstract": "Non-additivity between mutations--epistasis--profoundly shapes evolution. It can be difficult to understand its mechanistic origins. Here we show that \"ensemble epistasis\" is likely a universal feature of macromolecules. Using a simple analytical model, we found that epistasis arises when two conditions are met: 1) a macro-molecule populates at least three structures and 2) mutations have differential effects on a least two of the inactive structures. To explore the relative magnitude of ensemble epistasis, we performed a virtual deep-mutational scan of the allosteric Ca2+ signaling protein S100A4. We found that 27% of mutation pairs gave ensemble epistasis with a magnitude on the order of thermal fluctuations, 1 kT. We observed many forms of epistasis: magnitude, sign, and reciprocal sign epistasis. Depending on the effector concentration, the same mutation pair could even exhibit different forms of epistasis. The ubiquity of ensembles in biology and its pervasiveness in our dataset suggests that ensemble epistasis may be a universal mechanism of epistasis.\n\nSignificance statementAddressing the mechanistic origins of evolutionary unpredictability is critical to understanding how mutations combine to determine phenotype. Here we lay the theoretical foundations and investigate the plausibility of a potentially universal mechanism of unpredictability in macromolecules. Macromolecules often adopt a set of interchanging structures, called a thermodynamic ensemble. Mutations can change the relative population of each structure, introducing unpredictability in the mapping between genotype and phenotype. The conditions under which we expect this to arise are common in macromolecules, suggesting that this form of unpredictability may be pervasive in evolution. We conclude that the thermodynamic ensemble bakes unpredictability into biology and that future attempts to address it might incorporate this mechanistic insight.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer causing substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide. Oncogene RAS mutations occur notably in [~]45% of CRCs, associated with a poor prognosis. KRAS is subject to multiple tiers of regulation, including kinase. Aurora kinases has been implicated in many types of tumor onsets and progression, making them as a promising therapeutic targets. Alisertib (ALS), selectively inhibits Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and exerts potent anticancer activities in vitro and in vivo studies, but the latent anticancer effect of ALS on CRC remains unclear in the context of different KRAS mutations. This study aimed to assess the effects of ALS on RAS signaling pathway in a panel of CRC lines expressing different KRAS alleles, including Caco-2 (KRAS WT), Colo-678 (KRAS G12D), SK-CO-1 (KRAS G12V), HCT116 (KRAS G13D), CCCL-18 (KRAS A146T), and HT29 (BRAF V600E). The results showed that ALS modulated the active form of KRAS in a RAS allele specific manner across the panel of CRC lines; ALS differentially regulated RAS signal via PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways; and ALS induced apoptosis and autophagy in a RAS allele specific manner. Of note, in combination of ALS and MEK inhibitor, selumetinib, enhanced ALS regulatory effects in CRC lines in a RAS allele specific manner on apoptosis, autophagy, and cell growth. Taken together, this study suggests that ALS differentially regulates RAS signaling pathway and manipulates cell apoptosis and autophagy in RAS allele specific manner. The combinatorial approach of ALS and MEK inhibitor may represent a new therapeutic strategy for precision therapy of CRC in a RAS allele manner.",

    "abstract": "The loss of pancreatic {beta}-cell identity emerges as an important feature of type 2 diabetes development, but the molecular mechanisms are still elusive. Here, we explore the cell-autonomous role of the cell cycle regulator and transcription factor E2F1 in the maintenance of {beta}-cell identity and insulin secretion. We show that the {beta}-cell-specific loss of E2f1 function in mice triggers glucose intolerance associated with defective insulin secretion, an altered -to-{beta}-cell ratio, a downregulation of many {beta}-cell genes and a concomitant increase of non-{beta}-cell markers. Mechanistically, the epigenomic profiling of non-beta cell upregulated gene promoters identified an enrichment of bivalent H3K4me3/H3K27me3 or H3K27me3 marks. Conversely, downregulated genes were enriched in active chromatin H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone marks. We find that histone deacetylase inhibitors modulate E2F1 transcriptional and epigenomic signatures associated with these {beta}-cell dysfunctions. Finally, the pharmacological inhibition of E2F transcriptional activity in human islets also impairs insulin secretion and the expression of {beta}-cell identity genes. Our data suggest that E2F1 is critical for maintaining {beta}-cell identity through a sustained repression of non {beta}-cell transcriptional programs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe purpose of this study was to investigate growth plate dynamics in surgical and loading murine models of osteoarthritis, to understand whether abnormalities in these dynamics predict osteoarthritis vulnerability.\n\nMethods8-week-old C57BL/6 male mice underwent destabilisation of medial meniscus (DMM) (n = 8) surgery in right knee joints. Contralateral left knee joints had no intervention (controls). In 16-week-old C57BL/6 male mice (n = 6), osteoarthritis was induced using non-invasive mechanical loading of right knee joints with peak force of 11N. Non-loaded left knee joints were internal controls. Chondrocyte transiency in tibial articular cartilage and growth plate was confirmed by histology and immunohistochemistry. Tibial subchondral bone parameters were measured using microCT and correlated to 3D GP bridging analysis.\n\nResultsHigher expression of chondrocyte hypertrophy markers; Col10a1 and MMP13 were observed in tibial articular cartilage chondrocytes of DMM and loaded mice. In tibial growth plate, Col10a1 and MMP13 expressions were widely dispersed in a significantly enlarged zones of proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes in DMM (p=0.002 and p<0.0001, respectively) and loaded (both p<0.0001) tibiae of mice compared to their controls. 3D quantification revealed enriched growth plate bridging and higher bridge densities in medial compared to lateral tibiae of DMM and loaded knee joints of the mice. Growth plate dynamics were associated with higher subchondral bone volume fraction (BV/TV; %) in medial tibiae of DMM and loaded knee joints and epiphyseal trabecular bone volume fraction in medial tibiae of loaded knee joints.\n\nConclusionsThe results confirm articular cartilage chondrocyte transiency in a surgical and loaded murine model of osteoarthritis. Herein, we reveal for the first time spatial variation of growth plate bridging in surgical and loaded osteoarthritis models and how these may contribute to anatomical variation in vulnerability of osteoarthritis development.",

    "abstract": "In the last three decades, there have been recurring outbreaks of infectious diseases, brought to light with the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Attempts to effectively contain the spread of infectious diseases have been hampered by the lack of rapidly adaptable, accurate, and accessible point-of-care diagnostic testing. In this study, we present a novel design of a label-free DNAzyme-based detection method called Rapidemic. This assay combines recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) with linear strand-displacement amplification (LSDA) and guanine-quadruplex (GQ) DNAzyme-catalysed colour-changing reaction. The colorimetry basis of the signal readout omits the need for extensive instrumentation. Moreover, the primer-based sequence detection of RPA gives Rapidemic a potential to be rapidly adapted to target a new sequence. As a proof of concept, we developed the assay to detect isolated genomic DNA of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The use of low-pH buffers and the optimization of the dilution rates from each preceding reaction to the next showed to be successful strategies to enable visible detection with this method. These findings demonstrate for the first time that a label-free DNAzyme-based detection method can be coupled to RPA and LSDA for nucleic acid detection.",

    "abstract": "Humans reached the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific by ~3500 years ago, contemporaneous with or even earlier than the initial peopling of Polynesia. They crossed more than 2000 km of open ocean to get there, whereas voyages of similar length did not occur anywhere else until more than 2000 years later. Yet, the settlement of Polynesia has received far more attention than the settlement of the Marianas. There is uncertainty over both the origin of the first colonizers of the Marianas (with different lines of evidence suggesting variously the Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea, or the Bismarck Archipelago) as well as what, if any, relationship they might have had with the first colonizers of Polynesia. To address these questions, we obtained ancient DNA data from two skeletons from the Ritidian Beach Cave site in northern Guam, dating to ~2200 years ago. Analyses of complete mtDNA genome sequences and genome-wide SNP data strongly support ancestry from the Philippines, in agreement with some interpretations of the linguistic and archaeological evidence, but in contradiction to results based on computer simulations of sea voyaging. We also find a close link between the ancient Guam skeletons and early Lapita individuals from Vanuatu and Tonga, suggesting that the Marianas and Polynesia were colonized from the same source population, and raising the possibility that the Marianas played a role in the eventual settlement of Polynesia.\n\nSignificance StatementWe know far more about the settlement of Polynesia than we do about the settlement of the Mariana Islands in the western Pacific. There is debate over where people came from to get to the Marianas, with various lines of evidence pointing to the Philippines, Indonesia, New Guinea, or the Bismarck Archipelago, as well as uncertainty over how the ancestors of the present Mariana Islanders, the Chamorro, might be related to Polynesians. We analyzed ancient DNA from Guam, from two skeletons dating to ~2200 years ago, and found that their ancestry is linked to the Philippines. Moreover, they are closely-related to ancient Polynesians from Vanuatu and Tonga, suggesting that the early Mariana Islanders may have been involved in the colonization of Polynesia.",

    "abstract": "Monolignol glucosides are storage forms of monolignols, which are polymerized to lignin to strengthen plant cell walls. The conversion of monolignol glucosides to monolignols is catalyzed by monolignol {beta}-glucosidases. Rice Os4BGlu18 {beta}-glucosidase catalyzes hydrolysis of the monolignol glucosides, coniferin, syringin, and p-coumaryl alcohol glucoside more efficiently than other natural substrates. To understand more clearly the basis for substrate specificity of a monolignol {beta}-glucosidase, the structure of Os4BGlu18 was determined by X-ray crystallography. Crystals of Os4BGlu18 and its complex with {delta}-gluconolactone diffracted to 1.7 and 2.1 [A] resolution, respectively. Two protein molecules were found in the asymmetric unit of the P212121 space group of their isomorphous crystals. The Os4BGlu18 structure exhibited the typical ({beta}/)8 TIM barrel of glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1), but the four variable loops and two disulfide bonds appeared significantly different from other known structures of GH1 {beta}-glucosidases. Molecular docking studies of the Os4BGlu18 structure with monolignol substrate ligands placed the glycone in a similar position to the {delta}-gluconolactone in the complex structure and revealed the interactions between protein and ligands. Molecular docking, multiple sequence alignment, and homology modeling identified amino acid residues at the aglycone-binding site involved in substrate specificity for monolignol {beta}-glucosides. Thus, the structural basis of substrate recognition and hydrolysis by monolignol {beta}-glucosidases was elucidated.",

Astrocytic expression levels of various common genes that have been documented in TBI research are our target of interest, like, TNF, IL-1{beta}, and NOS1. Results summarize specific gene trends from 1-48 hours after cavitation. Our data concludes that maximum expression is not consistently exhibited immediately after cavitation exposure, and most genes have individualized genetic trends. IL-1{beta} shows a decreasing expression over 48 hours, and TNF shows upregulation until the 6 hour time point but then begins to decrease in expression. The upregulation of NOS1 has been documented in neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. This study has shown a consistent upregulation in NOS1 expression from 0-48 hours. These results postulate a possible linkage between cavitation damage and neurodegenerative diseases. This analysis also provides novelty in optimizing treatments for astrocytic function post-TBI and legitimizing the concern of cranial cavitation existence. These results add motivation for future studies of cavitation elimination or minimization via advanced helmet and airbag engineering.",

    "abstract": "In solid tumors, elevated fluid pressure and inadequate blood perfusion resulting from unbalanced angiogenesis are the prominent reasons for the ineffective drug delivery inside tumors. To normalize the heterogeneous and tortuous tumor vessel structure, antiangiogenic treatment is an effective approach. Additionally, the combined therapy of antiangiogenic agents and chemotherapy drugs has shown promising effects on enhanced drug delivery. However, the need to find the appropriate scheduling and dosages of the combination therapy is one of the main problems in anticancer therapy. Our study aims to generate a realistic response to the treatment schedule, making it possible for future works to use these patient-specific responses to decide on the optimal starting time and dosages of cytotoxic drug treatment. Our dataset is based on our previous in-silico model with a framework for the tumor microenvironment, consisting of a tumor layer, vasculature network, interstitial fluid pressure, and drug diffusion maps. In this regard, the chemotherapy response prediction problem is discussed in the study, putting forth a proof-of-concept for deep learning models to capture the tumor growth and drug response behaviors simultaneously. The proposed model utilizes multiple convolutional neural network submodels to predict future tumor microenvironment maps considering the effects of ongoing treatment. Since the model has the task of predicting future tumor microenvironment maps, we use two image quality evaluation metrics, which are structural similarity and peak signal-to-noise ratio, to evaluate model performance. We track tumor cell density values of ground truth and predicted tumor microenvironments. The model predicts tumor microenvironment maps seven days ahead with the average structural similarity score of 0.973 and the average peak signal ratio of 35.41 in the test set. It also predicts tumor cell density at the end day of 7 with the mean absolute percentage error of 2.292 {+/-} 1.820.\n\nAuthor summaryThe disorganized structure and leakiness of tumor vessels induce the inadequate blood supply and high fluid pressure within tumors. These features of the tumor microenvironment, identified as delivery barriers, lead to an insufficient amount of drugs to reach the interior parts of tumors. It is observed that the use of anti-vascular drugs makes the structure and function of the tumor vascular system more normal. Moreover, the combination of these drugs with cytotoxic agents provides favorable results with increased treatment response. But, it is also important to adjust the treatment schedule properly. In this regard, we build a deep learning model, designed to examine the tumor response with the ongoing treatment schedule. Our study suggests that deep learning models can be used to predict tumor growth and drug response in the scheduling of cytotoxic drugs.",

    "abstract": "Eye-specific segregation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is considered a hallmark of visual system development. However, a recent anatomical study showed that nearly half of the neurons in dLGN of adult mice still receive input from both retinae, but functional data about binocularity in mature dLGN is conflicting. Here, we found that a variable but small fraction of thalamocortical neurons is binocular in vivo. Using dual-channel optogenetics in vitro we correspondingly found that dLGN neurons are dominated by retinogeniculate input from one eye only, although most neurons also received small but detectable input from the non-dominant eye. Anatomical overlap between RGC axons and dLGN neuron dendrites did not explain this strong bias towards monocularity. Our data rather suggest that functional input selection and refinement, leaving the remaining non-dominant eye inputs in a juvenile-like state, underlies the prevalent monocularity of neurons in dLGN.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic variants in SYNGAP1 are one of the most common genetic causes of nonsyndromic intellectual disability (ID) and are considered a risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). SYNGAP1 encodes a synaptic GTPase activating protein that modulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of several small G-proteins and is implicated in regulating the composition of the postsynaptic density. By targeting the deletion of exons encoding the calcium/lipid binding (C2) and GTPase activating protein (GAP) domains, we generated a novel rat model to study SYNGAP related pathophysiology. We find that rats heterozygous for the C2/GAP domain deletion (Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP) exhibit reduced exploration and fear extinction, altered social behaviour, and spontaneous seizures, while homozygous mutants die within days after birth. This new rat model reveals that the enzymatic domains of SYNGAP are essential for normal brain function and provide an important new model system in the study of both ID/ASD and epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is one of the important pathogens, which has been proven to colonize and cause infection in the respiratory tract of patients with structural lung diseases, and further lead to bronchial fibrosis. Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) of bronchial epithelial cells plays a vital role in the process of bronchial fibrosis. Up to the present, the research on bronchial epithelial cells EMT caused by secreted virulence factors of PA has not been reported. In our present study, we found that PA3611 protein stimulation induced the bronchial epithelial cells EMT with up-regulation of mesenchymal cell markers and down-regulation of epithelial cell markers. Meantime, TGF-{beta}1 secretion was markedly increased, I{kappa}B expression was significantly decreased, and NF-{kappa}B p65 subunit phosphorylation was markedly enhanced, in addition, the levels of miR-3065-3p and miR-6802-3p expression and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were obviously increased in bronchial epithelial cells after PA3611 stimulation, further research revealed that PA3611 promoted EMT occur through TGF-{beta}1 induced p38/miRNA/NF-{kappa}b pathway. The function of PA3611 was also verified in PA-infected rats and results showed that {Delta}PA3611 could reduce lung inflammation and EMT. Overall, our results revealed that PA3611 promotes EMT via simulating the production of TGF-{beta}1 induced p38/miRNA/NF-{kappa}B pathway-dependent manner, suggesting that PA3611 acts as a crucial virulence factor in bronchial epithelial cells EMT process and has potential use as a target for clinical treatment of bronchial EMT and fibrosis caused by chronic PA infection.\n\nAuthor summaryStructural lung disease can increase the chance of chronic infection, including infected by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which can cause lung structure damages and affect lung functions in further, and forming a vicious circle of intertwining, ultimately, it leads to pulmonary fibrosis. EMT of bronchial epithelial cells plays a vital role in the process of bronchial fibrosis. However, the relationship and mechanism of PA infection leads to the destruction of lung structure and bronchial epithelial cells EMT are still not very clear. We found pseudomonas aeruginosa secreted protein PA3611 can stimulate bronchial epithelial cells EMT through up-regulation of mesenchymal cell markers -SMA and Vimentin expression and down-regulation of epithelial cell markers E-cadherin and Zonula Occludens-1. Meantime, TGF-{beta}1 secretion was markedly increased, I{kappa}B expression was significantly decreased, and NF-{kappa}B p65 subunit phosphorylation was markedly enhanced, in addition, the levels of miR-3065-3p and miR-6802-3p expression and p38 MAPK phosphorylation were obviously increased in bronchial epithelial cells after PA3611 stimulation, further studies suggested that PA3611 was shown to promote EMT occur through TGF-{beta}1 induced p38/miRNA/NF-Kb pathway. Our results revealed that PA3611 promotes EMT via simulating the production of TGF-{beta}1 induced p38/miRNA/NF-{kappa}B pathway-dependent manner, suggesting that PA3611 acts as a crucial virulence factor in bronchial epithelial cells EMT process and as a potential target for the treatment of chronic structural lung diseases.",

    "abstract": "This article describes a theoretical and computational study of the dynamical assembly of a protein shell around a complex consisting of many cargo molecules and long flexible scaffold molecules. Our study is motivated by bacterial microcompartments, which are proteinaceous organelles that assemble around a condensed droplet of enzymes and reactants. As in many examples of cytoplasmic liquid-liquid phase separation, condensation of the microcompartment interior cargo is driven by long flexible scaffold proteins that have weak multivalent interactions with the cargo. We describe a minimal model for the thermodynamics and dynamics of assembly of a protein shell around cargo and scaffold molecules, with scaffold-mediated cargo coalescence and encapsulation. Our results predict that the shell size, amount of encapsulated cargo, and assembly pathways depend sensitively on properties of the scaffold, including its length and valency of scaffold-cargo interactions. Moreover, the ability of self-assembling protein shells to change their size to accommodate scaffold molecules of different lengths depends crucially on whether the spontaneous curvature radius of the protein shell is smaller or larger than a characteristic elastic length scale of the shell. Beyond natural microcompartments, these results have important implications for synthetic biology efforts to target new molecules for encapsulation by microcompartments or viral shells. More broadly, the results elucidate how cells exploit coupling between self-assembly and liquid-liquid phase separation to organize their interiors.",
