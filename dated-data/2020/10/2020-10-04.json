    "abstract": "Achievements in intracortical neural interfaces are compromised by limitations in specificity and long-term performance. A biological intermediary between devices and the brain may offer improved specificity and longevity through natural synaptic integration with deep neural circuitry, while being accessible on the brain surface for optical read-out/control. Accordingly, we have developed the first \"living electrodes\" comprised of implantable axonal tracts protected within soft hydrogel cylinders for the biologically-mediated monitoring/modulation of brain activity. Here we demonstrate the controlled fabrication, rapid axonal outgrowth, reproducible cytoarchitecture, and simultaneous optical stimulation and recording of neuronal activity within these engineered constructs in vitro. We also present their transplantation, survival, integration, and optical recording in rat cortex in vivo as a proof-of-concept for this neural interface paradigm. The creation and functional validation of these preformed, axon-based \"living electrodes\" is a critical step towards developing a new class of biohybrid neural interfaces to probe and modulate native circuitry.",

    "abstract": "Infants and young children are the groups at greatest risk for severe disease resulting from Plasmodium falciparum infection. We previously demonstrated in mice that a protein vaccine composed of the chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 3 genetically fused to the minimally truncated circumsporozoite protein of P. falciparum (MCSP) elicits high concentrations of specific antibody and significant reduction of liver sporozoite load in a mouse model system. In the current study, a squalene based adjuvant (AddaVax, InvivoGen, San Diego, Ca) equivalent to the clinically approved MF59 (Seqiris, Maidenhead, UK) elicited greater antibody responses in mice than the previously employed adjuvant polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid, ((poly(I:C), InvivoGen, San Diego, Ca) and the clinically approved Aluminum hydroxide gel (Alum, Invivogen, San Diego, Ca) adjuvant. Use of the AddaVax adjuvant also expanded the range of IgG subtypes elicited by mouse vaccination. Sera passively transferred into mice from MCSP/AddaVax immunized one and six month old macaques significantly reduced liver sporozoite load upon sporozoite challenge. Protective antibody concentrations attained by passive transfer in the mice were equivalent to those observed in infant macaques 18 weeks after the final immunization. The efficacy of this vaccine in a relevant non-human primate model indicates its potential usefulness for the analogous high risk human population.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are innate immune cells with diverse functional and molecular phenotypes. This diversity is largely unexplored at the level of single-cell proteomes because of limitations of quantitative single-cell protein analysis. To overcome this limitation, we developed SCoPE2, which substantially increases quantitative accuracy and throughput while lowering cost and hands-on time by introducing automated and miniaturized sample preparation. These advances enable us to analyze the emergence of cellular heterogeneity as homogeneous monocytes differentiate into macrophage-like cells in the absence of polarizing cytokines. SCoPE2 quantified over 3,042 proteins in 1,490 single monocytes and macrophages in ten days of instrument time, and the quantified proteins allow us to discern single cells by cell type. Furthermore, the data uncover a continuous gradient of proteome states for the macrophages, suggesting that macrophage heterogeneity may emerge in the absence of polarizing cytokines. This gradient correlates to the inflammatory axis of classically and alternatively activated macrophages. Parallel measurements of transcripts by 10x Genomics suggest that our measurements sample 20-fold more protein copies than RNA copies per gene, and thus SCoPE2 supports quantification with improved count statistics. The joint distributions of proteins and transcripts allowed exploring regulatory interactions, such as between the tumor suppressor p53, its transcript, and the transcripts of genes regulated by p53. Our methodology lays the foundation for quantitative single-cell analysis of proteins by mass-spectrometry and demonstrates the potential for inferring transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation from variability across single cells.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=60 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/665307v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ead97org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@26b51aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13bd6a8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@189cf00_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Detecting changes in the environment is fundamental for our survival. According to predictive coding theory, detecting these irregularities relies both on incoming sensory information and our top-down prior expectations (or internal generative models) about the world. Prediction errors (PEs), detectable in event-related potentials (ERPs), occur when there is a mismatch between the sensory input and our internal model (i.e., a surprise event). Many changes occurring in our environment are irrelevant for survival and may remain unseen. Such changes, even if subtle, can nevertheless be detected by the brain without emerging into consciousness. What remains unclear is how these changes are processed in the brain at the network level. Here, we used a visual oddball paradigm, in which participants engaged in a central letter task during electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings while presented with task-irrelevant high- or low-coherence background, random-dot motion. Critically, once in a while, the direction of the dots changed. After the EEG session, we confirmed that changes in motion direction at high- and low-coherence were visible and invisible, respectively, using psychophysical measurements. ERP analyses revealed that changes in motion direction elicited PE regardless of the visibility, but with distinct spatiotemporal patterns. To understand these responses, we applied Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) to the EEG data. Bayesian Model Averaging showed visible PE relied on a release from adaptation (repetition suppression) within bilateral MT+, whereas invisible PE relied on adaptation at bilateral V1 (and left MT+). Furthermore, while feedforward upregulation was present for invisible PE, the visible change PE also included downregulation of feedback between right MT+ to V1. Our findings reveal a complex interplay of modulation in the generative network models underlying visible and invisible motion changes.",

    "abstract": "Damaged or mismatched DNA bases result in the formation of physical defects in double-stranded DNA. In vivo, defects in DNA must be rapidly and efficiently repaired to maintain cellular function and integrity. Defects can also alter the mechanical response of DNA to bending and twisting constraints, both of which are important in defining the mechanics of DNA supercoiling. Here, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and supporting statistical-mechanical theory to study the effect of mismatched base pairs on DNA supercoiling. Our simulations show that plectoneme pinning at the mismatch site is deterministic under conditions of relatively high force (> 2 pN) and high salt concentration (> 0.5 M NaCl). Under physiologically relevant conditions of lower force (0.3 pN) and lower salt concentration (0.2 M NaCl), we find that plectoneme pinning becomes probabilistic and the pinning probability increases with the mismatch size. These findings are in line with experimental observations. The simulation framework, validated with experimental results and supported by the theoretical predictions, provides a way to study the effect of defects on DNA supercoiling and the dynamics of supercoiling in molecular detail.",

    "abstract": "Progress in science requires standardized assays whose results can be readily shared, compared, and reproduced across laboratories. Reproducibility, however, has been a concern in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. Here we show that a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. We designed a task for head-fixed mice that combines established assays of perceptual and value-based decision making, and we standardized training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, and we collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, on past successes and failures, and on estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be successfully reproduced across multiple laboratories. They establish a standard for reproducible rodent behavior, and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. More generally, they indicate a path towards achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches.",

We marked FO candidate events at the time of epileptic spikes and verified them by screening for an isolated peak in the time-frequency plot. We performed electrical source imaging of spikes and FO within the Maximum Entropy of the Mean framework. Source localization maps were validated against the surgical cavity.\n\nResultsWe identified FO in five out of 10 patients who had a superficial or intermediate deep generator. The maximum of the FO maps was localized inside the cavity in all patients (100%). Analysis with a reduced electrode coverage using the 10-10 and 10-20 system showed a decreased localization accuracy of 60% and 40% respectively.\n\nConclusionsFO recorded with HD-EEG localize the EZ.

    "abstract": "Yarrowia lipolytica offers an ideal host for biosynthesis of high value natural products and oleochemicals through metabolic engineering despite being restricted to a limited number of selective markers, and counter-selection achieved primarily with URA3. In this work, we investigate MET25, a locus of sulfide housekeeping within the cell, to be exploited as a standard genetic marker. Divalent lead supplemented in media induces lead sulfide (PbS) aggregation in MET25-deficient cells such that deficient cells grow brown/black, and cells with functional copies of MET25 grow white. Loss of MET25 did not induce strict auxotrophic requirements for methionine in Y. lipolytica, indicating MET25 deficiency could be rescued by alternative pathways. Plasmid and chromosomal-based complementation of MET25 deficient cells on a double layer agar plate with nutrient gradients demonstrates delayed phenotype (white morphology) restoration, indicating post-transcriptional feedback regulation of methionine biosynthesis in this yeast. MET25 deficient Y. lipolytica could be used as an efficient whole-cell lead sensor with detection limit as low as 10 ppm of lead in drinking water. We further tested whether MET25 deficiency can be exploited to confer resistance to methyl-mercury through chemical neutralization and detoxification. Kinetic growth curves of wild type and MET25-deficient cells were obtained under varying concentrations of methylmercury and cellular toxicity to methyl mercury was calculated from the Hill equation. Our results indicate that methylmecury may not be used as the counter-selectable marker due to insignificant changes of growth fitness. This work demonstrates the utility of using MET25 as a sensitive lead sensor and the challenges of using MET25 as a counter-selectable genetic marker, as well as the complex regulation of methionine biosynthesis in Y. lipolyitca, which may shed lights for us to develop valuable biotechnological applications centering around the sulfur house-keeping metabolism of the nonconventional yeast.",

We found genomic regions with conserved binding of multiple transcription factors in mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) contain on average 12.6 conserved transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). These TFBS are a diverse repertoire of 70 different sequences representing the binding sites of both known and novel ESC regulators. Remarkably, using a diverse set of TFBS from this repertoire was sufficient to construct short synthetic enhancers with activity comparable to native enhancers. Site directed mutagenesis of conserved TFBS in endogenous enhancers or TFBS deletion from synthetic sequences revealed a requirement for more than ten different TFBS. Furthermore, specific TFBS, including the OCT4:SOX2 co-motif, are dispensable, despite co-binding the OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG master regulators of pluripotency. These findings reveal a TFBS diversity threshold overrides the need for optimized regulatory grammar and individual TFBS that bind specific master regulators.",

    "abstract": "Regeneration failure after spinal cord injury (SCI) results in part from the lack of a pro-regenerative response in injured neurons, but the response to SCI has not been examined specifically in injured sensory neurons. Using RNA sequencing of dorsal root ganglion, we determined that thoracic SCI elicits a transcriptional response distinct from sciatic nerve injury (SNI). Both SNI and SCI induced upregulation of ATF3 and Jun, yet this response failed to promote growth in sensory neurons after SCI. RNA sequencing of purified sensory neurons one and three days after injury revealed that unlike SNI, the SCI response is not sustained. Both SCI and SNI elicited the expression of ATF3 target genes, with very little overlap between conditions. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed ATF3 target genes revealed that fatty acid biosynthesis and terpenoid backbone synthesis were downregulated after SCI but not SNI. Pharmacologic inhibition of fatty acid synthase, the enzyme generating palmitic acid, decreased axon growth and regeneration in vitro. These results supports the notion that decreased expression of lipid metabolism-related genes after SCI, including fatty acid synthase, may restrict axon regenerative capacity after SCI.",

For SMLM, ASTER delivers homogeneous blinking kinetics at reasonable laser power, providing constant precision and higher throughput over fields of view 25 times larger than typical. This allows improved clustering analysis and uniform size measurements on sub-100 nm objects, as we demonstrate by imaging nanorulers, microtubules and clathrin-coated pits in COS cells, as well as periodic {beta}2-spectrin along the axons of neurons.

The development of effective in silico methods for evaluating drug interactions based on gene expression data requires an understanding of how various drugs alter gene expression. Current computational methods for the prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDIs) utilize data for known DDIs to predict unknown interactions. However, these methods are limited in the absence of known predictive DDIs. To improve DDIs interpretation, a recent study has demonstrated strong non-linear (i.e., dosedependent) effects of DDIs. In this study, we present a new unsupervised learning approach involving tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) in 3D. We utilize our approach to reanalyze available gene expression profiles for Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that non-linearity is possible, even for single drugs. Thus, non-linear dose-dependence cannot always be attributed to DDIs. Our analysis provides a basis for the design of effective methods for evaluating DDIs.",

We aim to study the infection dynamics of a phage cocktail against Mycobacteria under various pathophysiological conditions such as low pH, low growth rate and hypoxia. We show that mycobacteriophages are effective against M. smegmatis under various conditions and the phage cocktail prevents emergence of resistance for long durations. Although the phages are able to amplify after infection, the initial multiplicity of infection plays an important role in reducing the bacterial growth and prolonging efficacy. Mycobacteriophages are effective against antibiotic-resistant strains of Mycobacterium and show synergy with antibiotics such as rifampicin and isoniazid. Finally, we also show that mycobacteriophages are efficient against M. tuberculosis both under lag and log phase for several weeks. These findings have important implications for developing phage therapy for Mycobacterium.",

    "abstract": "Animals often use assessment signals to communicate information about their quality to a variety of receivers, including potential mates, competitors, and predators. But what maintains reliable signaling and prevents signalers from signaling a better quality than they actually have? Previous work has shown that reliable signaling can be maintained if signalers pay fitness costs for signaling at different intensities and these costs are greater for lower quality individuals than higher quality ones. Models supporting this idea typically assume that continuous variation in signal intensity is perceived as such by receivers. In many organisms, however, receivers have threshold responses to signals, in which they respond to a signal if it is above a threshold value and do not respond if the signal is below the threshold value. Here, we use both analytical and individual-based models to investigate how such threshold responses affect the reliability of assessment signals. We show that reliable signaling systems can break down when receivers have an invariant threshold response, but reliable signaling can be rescued if there is variation among receivers in the location of their threshold boundary. Our models provide an important step towards understanding signal evolution when receivers have threshold responses to continuous signal variation.",

    "abstract": "The identification and quantification of microbial abundance at the species or strain level from sequencing data is crucial for our understanding of human health and disease. Existing approaches for microbial abundance estimation either use accurate but computationally expensive alignment-based approaches for species-level estimation or less accurate but computationally fast alignment-free approaches that fail to classify many reads accurately at the species or strain-level.\n\nHere we introduce CAMMiQ, a novel combinatorial solution to the microbial identification and abundance estimation problem, which performs better than the best used tools on simulated and real datasets with respect to the number of correctly classified reads (i.e., specificity) by an order of magnitude and resolves possible mixtures of similar genomes.\n\nAs we demonstrate, CAMMiQ can better distinguish between single cells deliberately infected with distinct Salmonella strains and sequenced using scRNA-seq reads than alternative approaches. We also demonstrate that CAMMiQ is also more accurate than the best used approaches on a variety of synthetic genomic read data involving some of the most challenging bacterial genomes derived from NCBI RefSeq database; it can distinguish not only distinct species but also closely related strains of bacteria.\n\nThe key methodological innovation of CAMMiQ is its use of arbitrary length, doubly-unique substrings, i.e. substrings that appear in (exactly) two genomes in the input database, instead of fixed-length, unique substrings. To resolve the ambiguity in the genomic origin of doubly-unique substrings, CAMMiQ employs a combinatorial optimization formulation, which can be solved surprisingly quickly. CAMMiQs index consists of a sparsified subset of the shortest unique and doubly-unique substrings of each genome in the database, within a user specified length range and as such it is fairly compact. In short, CAMMiQ offers more accurate genomic identification and abundance estimation than the best used alternatives while using similar computational resources.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/algo-cancer/CAMMiQ",

    "abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been an abundance of research on the difference between age and age predicted using brain features, which is commonly referred to as the \"brain age gap\". Researchers have identified that the brain age gap, as a linear transformation of an out-of-sample residual, is dependent on age. As such, any group differences on the brain age gap could simply be due to group differences on age. To mitigate the brain age gaps dependence on age, it has been proposed that age be regressed out of the brain age gap. If this modified brain age gap (MBAG) is treated as a corrected deviation from age, model accuracy statistics such as R2 will be artificially inflated. Given the limitations of proposed brain age analyses, further theoretical work is warranted to determine the best way to quantify deviation from normality.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe brain age gap is an out-of-sample residual, and as such varies as a function of age.\nC_LIO_LIA recently proposed modification of the brain age gap, designed to mitigate the dependence on age, results in inflated model accuracy statistics if used incorrectly.\nC_LIO_LIGiven these limitations, we suggest that new methods should be developed to quantify deviation from normal developmental and aging trajectories.\nC_LI",

While manipulating such equilibria for biophysical study is often challenging, the application of pressure is a potential route to achieve such control by favoring the population of lower volume states. Here, we use this feature to study the interconversion of ARNT PAS-B Y456T, which undergoes a dramatic beta-strand slip as it switches between two stably-folded conformations. Coupling high pressure and biomolecular NMR, we obtained the first quantitative data testing two key hypotheses of this process: the slipped conformation is both smaller and less compressible than the wildtype equivalent, and the interconversion proceeds through a chiefly-unfolded intermediate state. Our work exemplifies how these approaches, which can be generally applied to protein conformational switches, can provide unique information that is not easily accessible through other techniques.",

    "abstract": "Strengthening the DNA barcode database is important for a species level identification, which was lacking for seaweeds. We made an effort to collect and barcode seaweeds occurring along Southeast coast of India. We barcoded 31 seaweeds species belonging to 21 genera, 14 family, 12 order of 3 phyla (viz., Chlorophyta, Phaeophyta and Rhodophyta). We found 10 species in 3 phyla and 2 genera (Anthophycus and Chnoospora) of Phaeophyta were barcoded for the first time. Uncorrected p-distance calculated using K2P, nucleotide diversity and Tajimas test statistics reveals highest values among the species of Chlorophyta. Over all K2P distance was 0.36. The present study revealed the potentiality of rbcL gene sequences in identification of all 3 phyla of seaweeds. We also found that the present barcode reference libraries (GenBank and BOLD) were insufficient in seaweeds identification and more efforts were needed for strengthening local seaweed barcode library to benefit rapids developing field such as environmental DNA barcoding. We also show that the constructed barcode library could aid various industrial experts involved in seaweed bio-resource exploration and taxonomy/non-taxonomic researches involved in climate, agriculture and epigenetics research in precise seaweed identification. Since the rise of modern high-throughput sequencing technologies is significantly altering bio-monitoring applications and surveys, reference datasets such as ours will become essential in ecosystems health assessment and monitoring.",

Asprosin is elevated in metabolic syndrome (MS) patients, and importantly, its genetic loss results in reduced appetite, leanness and robust insulin sensitivity, leading to protection from MS. Here we demonstrate that anti-asprosin monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are a dual-effect pharmacologic therapy that targets the two key pillars of MS - over-nutrition and the blood glucose burden. Anti-asprosin mAbs from three distinct species lowered appetite and body weight, and improved blood glucose in a dose-dependent and epitope-agnostic fashion in three independent MS mouse models, with an IC50 of [~]1.5 mg/kg. In addition, mAb treatment ameliorated MS associated dyslipidemia and hepatic dysfunction. The mAbs displayed half-life of over 3 days in vivo, with equilibrium dissociation-constants in picomolar to low nanomolar range. This evidence paves the way for further development towards an investigational new drug application and subsequent human trials for treatment of MS, a defining physical ailment of our time.",

    "abstract": "Identification and quantification of fish diet diversity was the first step in understanding the food web dynamics and ecosystem energetics, where the contribution of DNA barcoding technique has been important. We used DNA barcoding to identify the stomach contents of a euryhaline, benthophagous catfish Ariius maculatus. From 40 catfish stomach items sampled in two different seasons, we barcoded 67 piscine and macro-invertebrates prey items, identified as belonging to 13 species in 4 major phyla (viz., Chordate, Arthropod, Annelida and Mollusca). It is important to note that the mollusc taxa (Meritrix meritrix and Perna viridis) and a species of fish (Stolephorus indicus) could not be found among the gut contents of A. maculatus sampled during the pre- and post-monsoon season, respectively. Among the piscine diets of A. maculatus, Eubleekeria splendens (23.5%) and Stolephorus indicus (23.5%) were the major prey taxa during pre-monsoon season. The hermit crabs forms the major constituents of both pre- and post-monsoon seasons, among invertebrate taxa. Polychaete, Capitella capitata (25.92%) was abundantly consumed invertebrates next to hermit crabs. We noticed that in pre-monsoon A. maculatus was more piscivorous than post-monsoon. As revealed through Kimura-2 parametric pair{-}wise distance analysis, the diet diversity was relatively higher in post-monsoon. The accumulation curve estimated 57 haplotypes within 14 barcoded species (including the host A. maculatus). Majority of haplotypes were found among fishes (47.36%) followed by Arthropods (28.07%), Annelids (14.03%) and Mollusca (10.52%), respectively. This study also highlights that there is a growing concern about A. maculatuss aggressive predation on commercially important stocks of fish and invertebrates.

While at local scale biodiversity loss induces shifts in community structure, previous biogeographical analyses recorded consistent taxonomic structure of fish communities across global coral reefs. This suggest that regional communities represent a random subset of the global species and traits pool, whatever their species richness. Using distributional data on 3,586 fish species and latest advances in species distribution models we show that the global distribution of reef fishes is influenced by two major traits (body size and diet) and produces a strong divergence in the trait structure of assemblages across the biodiversity gradient. This divergence is best explained by the isolation of reefs during past unfavorable climatic conditions and highlights the risk of a global community re-organization if the ongoing climate-induced reef fragmentation is not halted.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining the balance between neuronal excitation and inhibition is essential for proper function of the central nervous system, with inhibitory synaptic transmission playing an important role. Although inhibitory transmission has higher kinetic demands compared to excitatory transmission, its properties are poorly understood. In particular, the dynamics and exocytosis of single inhibitory vesicles have not been investigated, due largely to both technical and practical limitations. Using a combination of quantum dots (QDs) conjugated to antibodies against the luminal domain of the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) to selectively label GABAergic (i.e., inhibitory) vesicles together with dual-focus imaging optics, we tracked the real-time three-dimensional position of single inhibitory vesicles up to the moment of exocytosis (i.e., fusion). Using three-dimensional trajectories, we found that inhibitory synaptic vesicles traveled a short distance prior to fusion and had a shorter time to fusion compared to synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1)-labeled vesicles, which were mostly from excitatory neurons. Moreover, our analysis revealed a close correlation between the release probability of inhibitory vesicles and both the proximity to their fusion site and the total travel length. Finally, we found that inhibitory vesicles have a higher prevalence of kiss-and-run fusion compared than Syt1-labeled vesicles. These results indicate that inhibitory synaptic vesicles have a unique set of dynamics and fusion properties to support rapid synaptic inhibition, thereby maintaining a tightly regulated balance between excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system.\n\nSignificanceDespite playing an important role in maintaining brain function, the dynamics of inhibitory synaptic vesicles are poorly understood. Here, we tracked the three-dimensional position of single inhibitory vesicles up to the moment of exocytosis in real time by loading single inhibitory vesicle with QDs-conjugated to antibodies against the luminal domain of the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). We found that inhibitory synaptic vesicles have a smaller total travel length before fusion, a shorter fusion time, and a higher prevalence of kiss-and-run than synaptotagmin-1-lableled vesicles. Our findings provide the first evidence that inhibitory vesicles have a unique set of dynamics and exocytosis properties to support rapid inhibitory synaptic transmission.",

    "abstract": "C4 photosynthesis evolved from the ancestral C3 photosynthesis by recruiting pre-existing genes to fulfill new functions. The enzymes and transporters required for the C4 photosynthesis have been intensively studied; however, the transcription factors (TFs) regulating these C4 metabolic genes are not well understood. In particular, how the TF regulatory network of C4 metabolic genes was rewired during the evolution is unclear. Here, we constructed TFs co-regulatory networks for core C4 metabolic genes (C4GRN) for four evolutionarily closely related species from the genus Flaveria, which represent four different evolutionary stages of the C4 photosynthesis, namely, C3, type I C3-C4, type II C3-C4 and C4. Our results show that more than half of the co-regulations of TFs and C4 core metabolic genes were species specific. The counterparts of C4 genes in C3 species were already co-regulated with the photosynthesis-related genes; whereas the required TFs for the C4 photosynthesis were recruited later. The type I C3-C4 species recruited 40% of C4 required TFs which co-regulated all core C4 metabolic genes but PEPC; nevertheless, the type II C3-C4 species took on a high divergent C4GRN with C4 species itself. In C4 species, PEPC and PPDK-RP possessed much more co-regulated TFs than other C4 metabolic genes. This study provides for the first time the TFs profiles of the C4 metabolic genes in species with different photosynthetic types and reveal the dynamic of C4 genes-TFs co-regulations along the evolutionary process, providing thereby new insights into the evolution of C4 photosynthesis.",

We sequenced and inferred the phylogenetic position of 43 previously unsampled Neotropical species from COI, H3, WNT, 18S, 16S, and 12S. Based on our phylogenies we found that Neotropical psocids are generally not closely related to morphologically similar taxa in the Holarctic region. Consequently, the monophyletic status for the major groups within Psocidae (subfamilies and tribes) is recovered only when Holarctic groups are sampled (7-10 of 11 higher-level groups are monophyletic) but violated when Neotropical species are included in the dataset (1 of 11 higher-level groups are monophyletic). Leveraging the largest phylogeny of the Psocidae, our study pinpoints the downfalls of simply extending taxonomic knowledge from lineages of a certain area to inform diversity and evolution of lineages in other regions.\n\nHighlightsO_LITropical psocids comprise >60% of the extant family richness\nC_LIO_LIPrevious phylogenies have undersampled Tropical psocids\nC_LIO_LIHolarctic and Neotropical species are classified under the same morphological groups\nC_LIO_LIHolarctic and Neotropical generally correspond to evolutionarily distinct lineages\nC_LIO_LIPhylogenies based on Holarctic psocids poorly inform evolution in the Neotropics\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Bipedal locomotion has several key challenges, such as balancing, foot placement, and gait optimization. We reach optimality from a very early age by using natural supports, such as our parents hands, chairs, and training wheels, and bootstrap a new knowledge from the recently acquired one. In this paper, we propose a scaffolded learning method from an evolutionary robotics perspective, where a biped creature achieves stable and independent bipedal walking while exploiting the natural scaffold of its changing morphology to create a third limb. Hence, we compare three conditions of scaffolded learning to reach bipedalism, and we prove that a performance-based scaffold is the most conducive to accelerate the learning of ontogenetic bipedal walking. Beyond a pedagogical experiment, this work presents a powerful tool to accelerate learning on robots.",

    "abstract": "The stem cell niche at the perivascular space in human tissue plays a pivotal role in dictating the overall fate of stem cells within it. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in particular, experience influential microenvironmental conditions, which induce specific metabolic profiles that affect processes such as cell differentiation and dysregulation of the immunomodulatory funtion. Reports focusing specifically on the metabolic status of MSCs under the effect of pathophysiological stimuli - in terms of flow velocities, shear stresses or oxygen tension - do not model heterogenous gradients, highlighting the need of more advanced models reproducing the metabolic niche. Organ-on-a-chip technology offers the most advanced tools for stem cell niche modelling thus allowing for controlled dynamic culture conditions while profiling tunable oxygen tension gradients. However, current systems for live cell detection of metabolic activity inside microfluidic devices require the integration of microsensors that allow for extracellular measurments only, giving innacurate and indirect information about the metabolic state of cells. Here, we present a metabolic toolbox coupling a miniatuirzed in vitro system for human-MSCs dynamic culture, that mimics microenvironmental conditions of the perivascular niche, with high-resolution imaging of intracellular metabolism. Using Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM) we monitor the spatial metabolic machinery and correlate it with experimentally validated intracellular oxygen concentration after designing the oxygen tension decay along the fluidic chamber by in silico models prediction. Our platform allows for the subjection of a metabolic profile to MSCs, mimicking the physiological niche in space and time, and its real-time monitoring representing a functional tool for modelling perivascular niches, relevant diseases and metabolic-related uptake of pharmaceuticals.",

    "abstract": "Identifying differentially expressed genes is difficult because of the small number of available samples compared with the large number of genes. Conventional gene selection methods employing statistical tests have the critical problem of heavy dependence of P-values on sample size. Although the recently proposed principal component analysis (PCA) and tensor decomposition (TD)-based unsupervised feature extraction (FE) has often outperformed these statistical test-based methods, the reason why they worked so well is unclear. In this study, we aim to understand this reason in the context of projection pursuit (PP) that was proposed a long time ago to solve the problem of dimensions; we can relate the space spanned by singular value vectors with that spanned by the optimal cluster centroids obtained from K-means. Thus, the success of PCA- and TD-based unsupervised FE can be understood by this equivalence. In addition to this, empirical threshold adjusted P-values of 0.01 assuming the null hypothesis that singular value vectors attributed to genes obey the Gaussian distribution empirically corresponds to threshold-adjusted P-values of 0.1 when the null distribution is generated by gene order shuffling. For this purpose, we newly applied PP to the three data sets to which PCA and TD based unsupervised FE were previously applied; these data sets treated two topics, biomarker identification for kidney cancers (the first two) and the drug discovery for COVID-19 (the thrid one). Then we found the coincidence between PP and PCA or TD based unsupervised FE is pretty well. Shuffling procedures described above are also successfully applied to these three data sets. These findings thus rationalize the success of PCA- and TD-based unsupervised FE for the first time.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose molecules into simpler sugars such as glucose is part of the second generation biofuel production process. Hydrolysis of lignocellulosic substrates is usually performed by enzymes produced and secreted by the fungus Trichoderma reesei. Studies identifying transcription factors involved in the regulation of cellulase production have been conducted but no overview of the whole regulation network is available. A transcriptomic approach with mixtures of glucose and lactose, used as a substrate for cellulase induction, was used to help us decipher missing parts in the network.\n\nResultsExperimental results confirmed the impact of sugar mixture on the enzymatic cocktail composition. The transcriptomic study shows a temporal regulation of the main transcription factors and a lactose concentration impact on the transcriptional profile. A gene regulatory network (GRN) built using the BRANE Cut software reveals three sub-networks related to i a positive correlation between lactose concentration and cellulase production, ii a particular dependence of the lactose onto the {beta}-glucosidase regulation and iii a negative regulation of the development process and growth.\n\nConclusionsThis work is the first investigating a transcriptomic study regarding the effects of pure and mixed carbon sources in a fed-batch mode. Our study expose a co-orchestration of xyr1, clr2 and ace3 for cellulase and hemicellulase induction and production, a fine regulation of the {beta}-glucosidase and a decrease of growth in favor of cellulase production. These conclusions provide us with potential targets for further genetic engineering leading to better cellulase-producing strains.",

    "abstract": "Slow and rhythmic spontaneous oscillations of cerebral blood flow are well known to have diagnostic utility, notably frequencies of 0.008-0.03 Hz (B-waves) and 0.05-0.15Hz (Mayer waves or M waves). However, intracranial measurements of these oscillations have been difficult. Oscillations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which are influenced by the cardiac pulse wave, represent a possible avenue for non-invasively tracking these oscillations using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), and have been used to correct for vascular oscillations in rs-fMRI functional connectivity calculations. However, the relationship between low-frequency CSF and vascular oscillations is unclear. In this study, we investigate this relationship using fast simultaneous multi-slice rs-fMRI coupled with fingertip photoplethysmography (PPG). We not only extract B-wave and M-wave range spectral power from the PPG signal, but also derive the pulse-intensity ratio (PIR, a surrogate of slow blood-pressure oscillations), the second-derivative of the PPG (SDPPG, a surrogate of arterial stiffness) and heart-rate variability (HRV). The main findings of this study are: (1) signals in different CSF regions (ROIs) are not equivalent in their vascular contributions or in their associations with vascular and tissue rs-fMRI signals; (2) the PPG signal contains the highest signal contribution from the M-wave range, while PIR contains the highest signal contribution from the B-wave range; (3) in the low-frequency range, PIR is more strongly associated with rs-fMRI signal in the CSF than PPG itself, and than HRV and SDPPG; (4) PPG-related vascular oscillations only contribute to < 20% of the CSF signal in rs-fMRI, insufficient support for the assumption that low-frequency CSF signal fluctuations directly reflect vascular oscillations. These findings caution the use of CSF as a monolithic region for extracting physiological nuisance regressors in rs-fMRI applications. They also pave the way for using rs-fMRI in the CSF as a potential tool for tracking cerebrovascular health through, for instance the strong relationship between PIR and the CSF signal.",

    "abstract": "The postharvest properties of two ultra-late maturing peach cultivars,  Tobihaku (TH) and  Daijumitsuto (DJ), were investigated. Fruit were harvested at commercial maturity and held at 25{degrees}C. TH exhibited the characteristics of normal melting flesh (MF) peach, including rapid fruit softening associated with an increase in endogenous ethylene production In contrast, DJ did not soften at all during three-week experimental period even though substantial ethylene production was observed. Fruit of TH and DJ were treated with 5000 ppm of propylene, an ethylene analog, continuously for seven days. TH softened rapidly whereas DJ maintained high flesh firmness in spite of an increase in endogenous ethylene production, suggesting that DJ but not TH lacked the ability to be softened in response to endogenous and exogenous ethylene/propylene. DNA-seq analysis showed that tandem endo-polygalacturonase (endoPG) genes located at melting flesh (M) locus, Pp-endoPGM (PGM) and Pp-endoPGF (PGF), were deleted in DJ. The endoPG genes at M locus are known to control flesh texture of peach fruit, and it was suggested that the non-softening property of DJ is due to the lack of endoPG genes. On the other hand, TH possessed an unidentified M haplotype that is involved in determination of MF phenotype. Structural identification of the unknown M haplotype, designated as M0, through comparison with previously reported M haplotypes revealed distinct differences between PGM on M0 haplotype (PGM-M0) and PGM on other haplotypes (PGM-M1). Peach M haplotypes were classified into four main haplotypes: M0 with PGM-M0; M1 with both PGM-M1 and PGF; M2 with PGM-M1; and M3 lacking both PGM and PGF. Re-evaluation of M locus in association with MF/non-melting flesh (NMF) phenotypes in more than 400 accessions by using whole genome shotgun sequencing data on database and/or by PCR genotyping demonstrated that M0 haplotype was the common haplotype in MF accessions, and M0 and M1 haplotypes were dominant over M2 and M3 haplotypes and co-dominantly determined the MF trait. It was also assumed on the basis of structural comparison of M haplotypes among Prunus species that the ancestral haplotype of M0 diverged from those of the other haplotypes before the speciation of Prunus persica.",

Therefore, understanding the precise molecular mechanisms that underpin plant fertility under environmental constraints is critical to safeguard future food production3. Here, we identified two Argonaute-like proteins whose activities are required to sustain male fertility in maize plants under high temperatures. We found that MALE-ASSOCIATED ARGONAUTE 1 and 2 (MAGO1 and MAGO2) associate with temperature-induced phased secondary small RNAs in pre-meiotic anthers and are essential to control the activity of retrotransposons in male meiocyte initials. Biochemical and structural analyses revealed how MAGO2 activity and its interaction with retrotransposon RNA targets are modulated through the dynamic phosphorylation of a set of highly conserved surface-located serine residues. Our results demonstrate that an Argonaute-dependent RNA-guided surveillance mechanism is critical in plants to sustain male fertility under environmentally constrained conditions by controlling the mutagenic activity of transposons in male germ cells.",

    "abstract": "The source-sink relationship is key to overall crop performance. Detailed understanding of the factors that determine source-sink dynamics is imperative for the balance of biomass and grain yield in crop plants. We investigated the differences in the source-sink relationship between a cultivated rice Oryza sativa cv. Nipponbare and a wild rice Oryza australiensis that show striking differences in biomass and grain yield. Oryza australiensis, accumulating higher biomass, not only showed higher photosynthesis per unit leaf area but also exported more sucrose from leaves than Nipponbare. However, grain features and sugar levels suggested limited sucrose mobilization to the grains in the wild rice due to vasculature and sucrose transporter functions. Low cell wall invertase activity and high sucrose synthase cleavage activity followed by higher expression of cellulose synthase genes in Oryza australiensis stem utilized photosynthates preferentially for the synthesis of structural carbohydrates, resulting in high biomass. In contrast, the source-sink relationship favored high grain yield in Nipponbare via accumulation of transitory starch in the stem, due to higher expression of starch biosynthetic genes, which is mobilized to panicles at the grain filling stage. Thus, vascular features, sucrose transport, and functions of sugar metabolic enzymes explained the differences in the source-sink relationship between Nipponbare and Oryza australiensis.\n\nHighlightVascular features, sucrose transport, and sugar metabolic enzyme activity contribute to the differential source-sink relationship between the selected cultivated and wild rice that differ in biomass and grain yield.",

    "abstract": "Hearing and balance rely on the capacity of mechanically sensitive hair bundles to transduce vibrations into electrical signals that are forwarded to the brain. Hair bundles possess tip links that interconnect the mechanosensitive stereocilia and convey force to the transduction channels. A dimer of dimers, each of these links comprises two molecules of protocadherin 15 (PCDH15) joined to two of cadherin 23 (CDH23). The \"handshake\" that conjoins the four molecules can be disrupted in vivo by intense stimulation and in vitro by exposure to Ca2+ chelators. Using hair bundles from the rats cochlea and the bullfrogs sacculus, we observed that extensive recovery of mechanoelectrical transduction, hair-bundle stiffness, and spontaneous bundle oscillation can occur within seconds after Ca2+ chelation, especially if hair bundles are deflected towards their short edges. Investigating the phenomenon in a two-compartment ionic environment that mimics natural conditions, we combined iontophoretic application of a Ca2+ chelator to selectively disrupt the tip links of individual frog hair bundles with displacement clamping to control hair-bundle motion and measure forces. Our observations suggest that, after the normal Ca2+ concentration has been restored, mechanical stimulation facilitates the reconstitution of functional tip links.\n\nSignificance StatementEach of the sensory receptors responsible for hearing or balance--a hair cell--has a mechanosensitive hair bundle. Mechanical stimuli pull upon molecular filaments--the tip links--that open ionic channels in the hair bundle. Loud sounds can damage hearing by breaking the tip links; recovery by replacement of the constituent proteins then requires several hours. We disrupted the tip links in vitro by removing the calcium ions that stabilize them, then monitored the electrical response or stiffness of hair bundles to determine whether the links could recover. We found that tip links recovered within seconds if their ends were brought back into contact. This form of repair might occur in normal ears to restore sensitivity after damage.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal formation is linked to spatial navigation, but there is little corroboration from freely-moving primates with concurrent monitoring of three-dimensional head and gaze stances. We recorded neurons and local field potentials across hippocampal regions in rhesus macaques during free foraging in an open environment while tracking their head and eye. Theta band activity was intermittently present at movement onset and modulated by saccades. Many cells were phase-locked to theta, with few showing theta phase precession. Most hippocampal neurons encoded a mixture of spatial variables beyond place fields and a negligible number showed prominent grid tuning. Spatial representations were dominated by facing location and allocentric direction, mostly in head, rather than gaze, coordinates. Importantly, eye movements strongly modulated neural activity in all regions. These findings reveal that the macaque hippocampal formation represents three-dimensional space using a multiplexed code, with head orientation and eye movement properties dominating over simple place and grid coding during free exploration.",

    "abstract": "Cluster-wise statistical inference is the most widely used technique for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data analyses. Cluster-wise statistical inference consists of two steps: i) primary thresholding that excludes less significant voxels by a pre-specified cut-off (e.g., p < 0.001); and ii) cluster-wise thresholding that controls the family-wise error rate (FWER) caused by clusters consisting of false positive suprathreshold voxels. It has been well known that the selection of the primary threshold is critical because it determines both statistical power and false discovery rate. However, in most existing statistical packages, the primary threshold is selected based on prior knowledge (e.g., p < 0.001) without taking into account the information in the data. In this manuscript, we propose a data-driven approach to objectively select the optimal primary threshold based on an empirical Bayes framework. We evaluate the proposed model using extensive simulation studies and an fMRI data example. The results show that our method can effectively increase statistical power while effectively controlling the false discovery rate.",

Within the brain, the dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMH) has been implicated in the integrative control of feeding, energy homeostasis, and circadian rhythms [1], but the underlying cell types are unknown. Here, we identify a role for DMH leptin receptor-expressing neurons (DMHLepR) in these effects. Using a viral approach, we show that silencing DMHLepR neurons in adult mice not only increases body weight and adiposity, but also shifts circadian rhythms in feeding and metabolism into the light-cycle. Moreover, DMHLepR silencing abolishes the normal increase in dark-cycle locomotor activity characteristic of nocturnal rodents. Furthermore, DMHLepR-silenced mice fail to entrain to a restrictive change in food availability. Together, these findings identify DMHLepR neurons as critical determinants of the daily time of feeding and associated metabolic rhythms.",

    "abstract": "Up to now, disrupted functional organization of the brain in Alzheimers disease (AD) has mostly been examined by assessing \"static\" functional connectivity (FC). However, recent studies have provided clear evidence that brain FC exhibits intrinsic spatiotemporal \"dynamic\" organization also being significantly affected in AD. However, inconsistency in former studies is a motivation for further investigation of impaired dynamic profile of brain FC networks in Alzheimers disease._In this work, we identified recurring FC states during rest (eyes-open) in 24 AD patients and 37 healthy controls (HC) by combining sliding window-based method (examining dynamic FC) and k-means clustering algorithm (identifying recurring FC states over time). To define the optimum number of recurring FC states in k-means algorithm, we employed non-supervised validity criteria such as silhouette value and Dunn index over bootstrap samples. Then, we examined differences in dynamic properties of recurring FC states including probability of occurrence, lifetime and switching profile between groups. Afterward, association between impaired dynamic profile of recurring FC states and cognitive performance was assessed in AD patients. Our findings revealed three recurring FC states and among them, FC state with the most significant differences in probability of occurrence (corrected p-value < 0.0001) included brain regions involved in default mode, frontoparietal and salience networks. This recurring FC state occurred significantly less and lasted shorter in patients with AD than in the HC. Further, the probability of occurrence in this recurring FC state significantly correlated positively with cognitive decline in patients with AD. Our findings suggest more decreased in cognitive performance in patients with AD associated with more reduced ability of AD patients to access clinically relevant impaired brain FC networks. Impaired dynamic profile of recurring FC states in AD provide greater understanding of ADs pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "When we move through our environment, objects in the visual scene create optic flow patterns on the retina. Even though optic flow is ubiquitous in everyday life, it is not well understood how our eyes naturally respond to it. In small groups of human and non-human primates, optic flow triggers intuitive, uninstructed eye movements to the patterns focus of expansion (Knoll, Pillow & Huk, 2018). Here we investigate whether such intuitive oculomotor responses to optic flow are generalizable to a larger group of human observers, and how eye movements are affected by motion signal strength and task instructions. Observers (n = 43) viewed expanding or contracting optic flow constructed by a cloud of moving dots radiating from or converging toward a focus of expansion that could randomly shift. Results show that 84% of observers tracked the focus of expansion with their eyes without being explicitly instructed to track. Intuitive tracking was tuned to motion signal strength: saccades landed closer to the focus of expansion and smooth tracking was more accurate when dot contrast, motion coherence, and translational speed were high. Under explicit tracking instruction, the eyes aligned with the focus of expansion more closely than without instruction. Our results highlight the sensitivity of intuitive eye movements as indicators of visual motion processing in dynamic contexts.",

    "abstract": "AimPlant distributions are influenced by species ability to colonize new areas via long-distance dispersal and propensity to adapt to new environments via niche evolution. We use Otoba (Myristicaceae), an ecologically dominant tree genus found in low-to-mid elevation wet forests, as a system to understand the relative importance of these processes within the Neotropics, a region characterized by high species richness and a diversity of biomes.\n\nLocationNeotropics and global\n\nTaxonOtoba and entire Myristicaceae\n\nMethodsWe resolve the first phylogeny of Otoba using targeted sequence capture phylogenomics. We pair this with the most densely sampled phylogeny of Myristicaceae to date, inferred using publicly available data. We then use phylogenetic comparative methods to infer biogeography and examine patterns of niche evolution.\n\nResultsMyristicaceae has an Old World origin, with a single expansion event into the Americas. Divergence dates, fossil evidence, and a notable lack of long-distance dispersal are consistent with a Boreotropical origin of Neotropical Myristicaceae. Mirroring the rarity of dispersal at the family level, Otobas biogeography is marked by few biogeographic events: two expansions into Central America from a South American ancestor and a single dispersal event across the Andes. This limited movement contrasts with rapid climatic niche evolution, typically occurring across geographically proximate habitats.\n\nMain conclusionsContrasting with previous studies, long-distance dispersal does not need to be invoked to explain the pantropical distribution of Myristicaceae, nor the biogeography of Otoba. This likely results from the familys relatively large seeds that are dispersed by large-bodied vertebrates. Instead, rapid niche evolution in Otoba has facilitated its occurrence throughout mesic habitats of the northern Neotropics, including the Amazon rainforest and Andean montane forests. Otoba adds to a growing group of Neotropical plant clades in which climate adaptation following local migration is common, implying an important role of niche evolution in the assembly of the Neotropical flora.\n\nSignificance statementSpecies distributions across the climatically and topographically heterogenous Neotropics are explained by a combination of local adaptation and dispersal. The relative importance of these mechanisms is clade dependent. We find that niche evolution in geographically proximal habitats is much more common than long-distance dispersal to preadapted regions in the tree genus Otoba, which includes both hyperdominant Amazonian species and narrow Andean endemics. The lack of long-distance dispersal is likely due to Otobas large seeds. Our results add to a growing body of literature demonstrating a key role of labile niche evolution across steep environmental gradients in Neotropical plant biogeography.",

    "abstract": "Northern elephant seals migrate long distances from feeding grounds to raise pups during a brief period on breeding beaches. Since gestation sets a parturition date months in advance, timing of the arrival must be precise. We used satellite-tracked animals to examine this timing, establishing arrival and birth dates in 106 migrating females and estimating how far they traveled in the days just before birth. Females arrived a mean of 5.5 days prior to birth (range 1-11, sd=1.6), and females arriving later in the breeding season cut that pre-birth interval by 1.8 days relative to early arrivers. There was no correlation between female body condition, nor female age, and the pre-birth interval. The last 15 days prior to birth, animals traveled as far as 1465 km. Those furthest from the colony traveled > 100 km per day, three times faster than animals near the colony at the same time. Despite migrations covering several thousand kilometers while pregnant, female elephant seals were able to time their arrival within 6 days, swimming steadily at high speed if needed. This allows them to maintain a precise annual cycle for many years consecutively.",

    "abstract": "Protein-protein binding is fundamental to most biological processes. It is important to be able to use computation to accurately estimate the change in protein-protein binding free energy due to mutations in order to answer biological questions that would be experimentally challenging, laborious or time consuming. Although non-rigorous free energy methods are faster, rigorous alchemical molecular dynamics-based methods are considerably more accurate and are becoming more feasible with the advancement of computer hardware and molecular simulation software. Even with sufficient computational resources, there are still major challenges to using alchemical free energy methods for protein-protein complexes, such as generating hybrid structures and topologies, maintaining a neutral net charge of the system when there is a charge-changing mutation, and setting up the simulation. In the current study, we have used the pmx package to generate hybrid structures and topologies, and a double-system/single-box approach to maintain the net charge of the system. To test the approach, we predicted relative binding affinities for two protein-protein complexes using a non-equilibrium alchemical method based on the Crooks fluctuation theorem and compared the results with experimental values. The method correctly identified stabilizing from destabilizing mutations for a small protein-protein complex, but was not as successful to the larger, more challenging antibody complex. In addition, the correlation between predicted and experimental relative binding affinities was high for smaller complex, and low for the other larger complex.",

    "abstract": "mRNA m5C, which has recently been implicated in the regulation of mRNA mobility, metabolism, and translation, plays important regulatory roles in various biological events. Two types of m5C sites are found in mRNAs. Type I m5C sites, which contain a downstream G-rich triplet motif and are computationally predicted to locate in the 5 end of putative hairpin structures, are methylated by NSUN2. Type II m5C sites contain a downstream UCCA motif and are computationally predicted to locate in the loops of putative hairpin structures. However, their biogenesis remains unknown. Here we identified NSUN6, a methyltransferase that is known to methylate C72 of tRNAThr and tRNACys, as an mRNA methyltransferase that targets Type II m5C sites. Combining the RNA secondary structure prediction, miCLIP, and results from a high-throughput mutagenesis analysis, we determined the RNA sequence and structural features governing the specificity of NSUN6-mediated mRNA methylation. Integrating these features into an NSUN6-RNA structural model, we identified an NSUN6 variant that largely loses tRNA methylation but retains mRNA methylation ability. Finally, we revealed a negative correlation between m5C methylation and translation efficiency. Our findings uncover that mRNA m5C is tightly controlled by an elaborate two-enzyme system, and the protein-RNA structure analysis strategy established may be applied to other RNA modification writers to distinguish the functions of different RNA substrates of a writer protein.",

    "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila is a Gram-negative bacterium ubiquitous in freshwater environments which, if inhaled, can cause a severe pneumonia in humans. The emergence of L. pneumophila is linked to several traits selected in the environment, the acquisition of some of which involved intra- and interkingdown horizontal gene transfer events. Transposon-insertion sequencing (TIS) is a powerful method to identify the genetic basis of selectable traits as well as to identify fitness determinants and essential genes, possible antibiotic targets. TIS has not yet been used to its full power in L. pneumophila, possibly because of difficulty to obtain a high-saturation transposon insertion library. Indeed, we found that ST1 isolates, to which belong the commonly used laboratory strains, are poorly permissive to saturating mutagenesis by conjugation-mediated transposon delivery. In contrast, we obtained high-saturation libraries in non-ST1 clinical isolates, offering the prospect of using TIS on unaltered L. pneumophila strains. Focusing on one of them, we therefore used TIS to identify essential genes in L. pneumophila. We also revealed that TIS could be used to identify genes controlling vertical transmission of mobile genetic elements. We then applied TIS to identify all the genes required for L. pneumophila to develop competence and undergo natural transformation, defining the set of major and minor Type IV pilins that are engaged in DNA uptake. This work paves the way for the functional exploration of the L. pneumophila genome by TIS and the identification of the genetic basis of other life traits of this species.\n\nImportanceLegionella pneumophila is the etiologic agent of a severe form of nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia in humans. L. pneumophila is found in man-made and freshwater environments which are the causing source of the infection. The environmental life traits of L. pneumophila, such as its abilities to form biofilms, resist biocides and unicellular predators, are essential to its ability to accidentally infect humans. A comprehensive identification of the genetic basis of these life traits could be obtained through the use of transposon-insertion sequencing. Yet, this powerful approach, had not been fully implemented in L. pneumophila. Here we described the successful implementation of the transposon-sequencing approach in a clinical isolate of L. pneumophila. We identify essential genes, potential drug targets, and genes required for horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation. This work represents an important step towards identifying the genetic basis of the many life traits of this environmental and pathogenic species.",

    "abstract": "In culture system, environmental factors, such as increasing exogenous growth factors and adhesion to type I collagen (Col-I) induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cells. Col-I molecules maintain a non-fibril form under acidic conditions, and they reassemble into fibrils under physiological conditions. Col-I fibrils often assemble to form three-dimensional gels. The gels and non-gel-form of Col-I can be utilized as culture substrates and different gel-forming state often elicit different cell behaviors. However, gel-form dependent effects on cell behaviors, including EMT induction, remain unclear. EMT induction in lung cancer cell line A549 has been reported via adhesion to Col-I but the effects of gel form dependency are unelucidated. This study investigated the changes in EMT-related behaviors in A549 cells cultured on Col-I gels.\n\nWe examined cell morphology, proliferation, single-cell migration and expression of EMT-related features in A549 cells cultured on gels or non-gel form of Col-I and non-treated dish with or without transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta}1. On Col-I gels, some cells kept cell-cell contacts and formed clusters, others maintained single-cell form. In cell-cell contact regions, E-cadherin expression was downregulated, whereas that of N-cadherin was upregulated. Vimentin and integrins 2 and {beta}1 expression were not increased. In TGF-{beta}1-treated A549 cells, cadherin switched from E- to N-cadherin. Their morphology changed to a mesenchymal form and cells scattered with no cluster formation. Vimentin, integrins 2 and {beta}1 expression were upregulated. Thus, we concluded that culture on Col-I fibrous gels induced E- to N-cadherin switching without other EMT-related phenotypes in A549 cells.",

Yet despite the global degradation of soils, how the loss of soil microbial diversity can de-stabilizes ecosystem functioning is unknown. Here we experimentally quantified the contribution diversity and the temporal dynamics in the composition of soil microbial communities to the temporal stability of four key ecosystem functions related to nutrient and carbon cycling. Soil microbial diversity loss reduced the temporal stability of all ecosystem functions and was particularly strong when over 50% of microbial taxa were lost. The stabilizing effect of soil biodiversity was linked to asynchrony among microbial taxa whereby different soil fungi and bacteria were associated with different ecosystem functions at different times. Our results emphasize the need to conserve soil biodiversity in order to ensure the reliable provisioning of multiple ecosystems functions that soils provide to society.",

Our 3D tissue-engineered model comprises patient-derived glioma stem cells, human astrocytes and microglia, and interstitial fluid flow. We found flow contributes to all outcomes across seven patient-derived lines, and glial effects are driven by CCL2 and differential glial activation. We conducted a six-drug screen using four outcomes and find expression of putative stemness marker CD71, opposed to viability IC50, significantly predicts murine xenograft survival.

However, interaction graphs cannot adequately capture temporal changes. Among models that investigate dynamics, Boolean network models can approximate simple features of interaction graphs integrating also dynamics. Nevertheless, dynamic analyses are time-consuming and with growing number of nodes may become infeasible. Therefore, we set up a method to identify minimal sets of nodes able to determine network dynamics. This approach is able to depict dynamics without calculating exhaustively the complete network dynamics. Applying it to a variety of biological networks, we identified small sets of nodes sufficient to determine the dynamic behavior of the whole system. Further characterization of these sets showed that the majority of dynamic decision-makers were not static hubs. Our work suggests a paradigm shift unraveling a new class of nodes different from static hubs and able to determine network dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Osmotic equilibrium and membrane potential in animal cells depend on concentration gradients of sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) ions across the plasma membrane, a function that is catalyzed by the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit. In vertebrates, four paralogous genes, ATP1A1-4, encode distinct alpha subunit isoforms (a1-a4), three of which (a1, a2, a3) are expressed in the brain, and two (a1, a3) predominantly in neurons. The a3 isoform, encoded by ATP1A3, is critical to neuronal physiology, and a growing spectrum of neurological diseases are associated with ATP1A3 pathogenic variants, with ages of onset ranging from early childhood to adulthood. Here, we describe ATP1A3 variants encoding dysfunctional a3 subunits in children affected by polymicrogyria, a developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex characterized by abnormal folding and laminar organization. To gain cell-biological insights into the spatiotemporal dynamics of prenatal ATP1A3 expression, we established a transcriptional atlas of ATP1A3 expression during cortical development using mRNA in situ hybridization and transcriptomic profiling of ~125,000 individual cells with single-cell RNA sequencing (Drop-Seq) from various areas of the midgestational human neocortex. We find that fetal expression of ATP1A3 is restricted to a subset of excitatory neurons carrying transcriptional signatures of neuronal activity and maturation characteristic of the developing subplate. Furthermore, by performing Drop-Seq on ~52,000 nuclei from four different areas of an infant human neocortex, we show that ATP1A3 expression persists throughout early postnatal development, not only within excitatory neurons across all cortical layers, but also and more predominantly in inhibitory neurons, with specific enrichment in fast-spiking basket cells. In addition, we show that ATP1A3 expression, both in fetal and postnatal neurons, tends to be higher in frontal cortical areas than in occipital areas, in a pattern consistent with the rostro-caudal maturation gradient of the human neocortex. Finally, we discover distinct co-expression patterns linking catalytic  subunit isoforms (ATP1A1,2,3) and auxiliary isoforms (ATP1B1,2,3), suggesting the ATPase pump may form non-redundant, cell-type specific -{beta} combinations. Together, the importance of the developmental phenotypes and dynamic expression patterns of ATP1A3 point to a key role for a3 in the development and function of human cortex.",

A growing number of cases of adaptive introgression are being identified in species across the tree of life, however the timing of selection, and therefore the importance of the different evolutionary roles of admixture, is typically unknown. Here, we investigate the spatio-temporal history of selection favoring Neanderthal-introgressed alleles in modern human populations. Using both ancient and present-day samples of modern humans, we integrate the known demographic history of populations, namely population divergence and migration, with tests for selection. We model how a sweep placed along different branches of an admixture graph acts to modify the variance and covariance in neutral allele frequencies among populations at linked loci. Using a method based on this model of allele frequencies, we study previously identified cases of Neanderthal adaptive introgression. From these, we identify cases in which Neanderthal introgressed alleles were quickly beneficial and other cases in which they persisted at low frequency for some time. For some of the alleles that persisted at low frequency, we show that selection likely independently favored them later on in geographically separated populations. Our work highlights how admixture with ancient hominins has contributed to modern human adaptation and contextualizes observed levels of Neanderthal ancestry in present-day and ancient samples.",

While traditionally reliant on simple technologies for presenting stimuli (e.g., lights and sounds) and recording responses made to basic manipulanda (e.g., levers and buttons), an increasing number of researchers are beginning to use Touchscreen-equipped Operant Chambers (TOCs). These TOCs have obvious advantages, namely by allowing researchers to present a near infinite number of stimuli as well as increased flexibility in the types of responses that can be made and recorded. Here, we trained wild-caught adult and juvenile great-tailed grackles (Quiscalus mexicanus) to complete experiments using a TOC. We have learned much from these efforts, and outline the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches. We report data from our training sessions and discuss important modifications we made to facilitate animal engagement and participation in various tasks. Finally, we provide a \"training guide\" for creating experiments using PsychoPy, a free and open-source software that we have found to be incredibly useful during these endeavors. This article, therefore, should serve as a useful resource to those interested in switching to or maintaining a TOC, or who similarly wish to use a TOC to test the cognitive abilities of non-model species or wild-caught individuals.",

Using an established murine model of RA-associated lung disease combining collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) with organic dust extract (ODE)-induced airway inflammation, differences among lung immune cell populations were analyzed by single cell RNA-sequencing. Additionally, four lung myeloid-derived immune cell populations including macrophages, monocytes/macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils were isolated by fluorescence cell sorting and gene expression was determined by NanoString analysis. Unsupervised clustering revealed 14 discrete clusters among Sham, CIA, ODE, and CIA+ODE treatment groups: 3 neutrophils (inflammatory, resident/transitional, autoreactive/suppressor), 5 macrophages (airspace, differentiating/recruited, recruited, resident/interstitial, and proliferative airspace), 2 T-cells (differentiating and effector), and a single cluster each of inflammatory monocytes, dendritic cells, B-cells and natural killer cells. Inflammatory monocytes, autoreactive/suppressor neutrophils, and recruited/differentiating macrophages were predominant with arthritis induction (CIA and CIA+ODE). By specific lung cell isolation, several interferon-related and autoimmune genes were disproportionately expressed among CIA and CIA+ODE (e.g. Oasl1, Oas2, Ifit3, Gbp2, Ifi44, and Zbp1), corresponding to RA and RA-associated lung disease. Monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells were reduced, while complement genes (e.g. C1s1 and Cfb) were uniquely increased in CIA+ODE mice across cell populations. Recruited and inflammatory macrophages/monocytes and neutrophils expressing interferon-, autoimmune-, and complement-related genes might contribute towards pro-fibrotic inflammatory lung responses following airborne biohazard exposures in setting of autoimmune arthritis and could be predictive and/or targeted to reduce disease burden.",

    "abstract": "Invertebrates express one endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident Ca2+-sensing stromal-interaction molecule (Stim) and one Orai plasma membrane channel protein. Stim conveys store depletion to Orai, mediating the evolutionarily conserved Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) current. The crucial role of their vertebrate homologues, STIM1 and Orai1 in mediating CRAC activity in mammals is well-established. However, mammals possess two STIM and three Orai isoforms and the choreography of their interactions under physiological receptor activation is unknown. We show that the five mammalian STIM1/2 and Orai1/2/3 isoforms have non-redundant functions. Yet, all five isoforms are always required together to ensure the graded diversity of mammalian Ca2+ signaling events in response to the full spectrum of agonist strengths. Receptor-activated Ca2+ signaling across the range of stimulus intensities requires functional interactions between not only STIM1/2 and Orai1/2/3, but also IP3R, ensuring that receptor-mediated Ca2+ release is precisely tailored to Ca2+ entry and activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT). This is orchestrated by two interdependent and counterbalancing paradigms: the N-termini Ca2+-binding ER-luminal domains of unactivated STIM1/2 inhibit IP3R-evoked Ca2+ release. Gradual increase in agonist intensity leads to gradual STIM1/2 activation and relief of IP3R inhibition. Concomitantly, the cytosolic C-termini of activated STIM1/2 differentially interact with Orai1/2/3 proteins as agonist intensity increases. Thus, coordinated and omnitemporal functions of all five STIM/Orai proteins and IP3Rs at the ER-lumen and cytosol translate the strength of agonist stimulation to precise levels of Ca2+ release, Ca2+ entry and NFAT induction, ensuring the diversity and fidelity of complex mammalian Ca2+ signaling.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAll five STIM/Orai and IP3R are always required together in mammalian Ca2+ signalling\nC_LIO_LIUnactivated STIM1/2 inhibit IP3R and activated STIM1/2 cooperatively activate Orai1/2/3\nC_LIO_LISTIM1 contribution increases and that of STIM2 decreases as agonist intensifies\nC_LIO_LIGraded IP3R disinhibition and Orai activation tailor receptor activity to NFAT induction\nC_LI\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=192 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/325480v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (65K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f6172dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6bbb09org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c45c80org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@194d7e4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) receptors have been implicated in responses to aversive stimuli in mammals and fish, but its precise role is still unknown. Moreover, since at least seven families of 5-HT receptors exist in vertebrates, the role of specific receptors is still debated. Aversive stimuli can be classified as indicators of proximal, distal, or potential threat, initiating responses that are appropriate for each of these threat levels. Responses to potential threat usually involve cautious exploration and increased alertness, while responses to distal and proximal threat involve a fight-flight-freeze reaction. We exposed adult zebrafish to a conspecific alarm substance (CAS) and observed behavior during (distal threat) and after (potential threat) exposure, and treated with the 5-HT2C receptor agonists MK-212 or WAY-161503 or with the antagonist RS-102221. The agonists blocked CAS-elicited defensive behavior (distal threat), but not post-exposure increases in defensive behavior (potential threat), suggesting inhibition of responses to distal threat. MK-212 blocked changes in freezing elicited by acute restraint stress, a model of proximal threat, while RS-102221 blocked changes in geotaxis elicited this stressor. We also found that RS-102221, a 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, produced small effect on behavior during and after exposure to CAS.\n\nPreprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.04.324202; Data and scripts: https://github.com/lanec-unifesspa/5-HT-CAS/tree/master/data/5HT2C",

Accordingly, we develop the EGCG-EDC/NHS membranes, prepared with physically immersion, while the surface morphology of the membrane was observed by SEM, the biological activity of collagen was determined by FTIR, the activity and adhesion of cell culture in vitro, angiogenesis and monocyte/macrophage recruitment after subcutaneous implantation, etc. are characterized. It could be concluded that EGCG-EDC/NHS collagen membrane is hopeful to be used in implant dentistry for it not only retains the advantages of the collagen membrane itself, but also improves cell viability, adhesion and vascularization tendency. However, the mechanism that lies in the regenerative advantages of such membrane needs further exploration, but it is certain that the differences in surface morphology can have a significant impact on the reaction between the host and the implant, not to mention macrophage in bone regeneration.",

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need for new treatments to prevent and ameliorate severe illness and death induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in COVID-19 patients. The coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-1 causes pneumonitis in mice which shares many pathological characteristics with human SARS-CoV infection. Previous studies have shown that the amino acid gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) has anti-inflammatory effects. We tested whether oral treatment with GABA could modulate the MHV-1 induced pneumonitis in susceptible A/J mice. As expected, MHV-1-inoculated control mice became severely ill (as measured by weight loss, clinical score, and the ratio of lung weight to body weight) and >60% of them succumbed to the infection. In contrast, mice that received GABA immediately after MHV-1 inoculation became only mildly ill and all of them recovered. When GABA treatment was initiated after the appearance of illness (3 days post-MHV-1 infection), we again observed that GABA treatment significantly reduced the severity of illness and greatly increased the frequency of recovery. Therefore, the engagement of GABA receptors (GABA-Rs) prevented the MHV-1 infection-induced severe pneumonitis and death in mice. Given that GABA-R agonists, like GABA and homotaurine, are safe for human consumption, stable, inexpensive, and available worldwide, they are promising candidates to help prevent severe illness stemming from SARS-CoV-2 infection and other coronavirus strains.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to mitigate COVID-19 include screening of existing antiviral molecules that could be re-purposed to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. Although SARS-CoV-2 propagates efficiently in African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, antivirals such as nucleos(t)ide analogs (nucs) often exhibit decreased activity in these cells due to inefficient metabolization. Limited SARS-CoV-2 replication and propagation occurs in human cells, which are the most relevant testing platforms. By performing serial passages of a SARS-CoV-2 isolate in the human hepatoma cell line clone Huh7.5, we selected viral populations with improved viability in human cells. Culture adaptation led to the emergence of a significant number of high frequency changes (>90% of the viral population) in the region coding for the spike glycoprotein, including a deletion of nine amino acids in the N-terminal domain and 3 amino acid changes (E484D, P812R, and Q954H). We demonstrated that the Huh7.5-adapted virus exhibited a >3-Log10 increase in infectivity titers (TCID50) in Huh7.5 cells, with titers of ~8 Log10TCID50/mL, and >2-Log10 increase in the human lung cancer cell line Calu-1, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. Culture adaptation in Huh7.5 cells further permitted efficient infection of the otherwise SARS-CoV-2 refractory human lung cancer cell line A549, with titers of ~6 Log10TCID50/mL. The enhanced ability of the virus to replicate and propagate in human cells permitted screening of a panel of nine nucs, including broad-spectrum compounds. Remdesivir, EIDD-2801 and to a limited extent galidesivir showed antiviral effect across these human cell lines, whereas sofosbuvir, uprifosbuvir, valopicitabine, mericitabine, ribavirin, and favipiravir had no apparent activity.\n\nImportanceThe cell culture adapted variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus obtained in the present study, showed significantly enhanced replication and propagation in various human cell lines, including lung derived cells otherwise refractory for infection with the original virus. This SARS-CoV-2 variant will be a valuable tool permitting investigations across human cell types, and studies of identified mutations could contribute to our understanding of viral pathogenesis. In particular, the adapted virus can be a good model for investigations of viral entry and cell tropism for SARS-CoV-2, in which the spike glycoprotein plays a central role. Further, as shown here with the use of remdesivir and EIDD-2801, two nucs with significant inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2, large differences in the antiviral activity are observed depending on the cell line. Thus, it is essential to select the most relevant target cells for pre-clinical screenings of antiviral compounds, facilitated by using a virus with broader tropism.",

Their blood was collected to analyze the genotype using PCR-RFLP and T-ARMS-PCR method for clopidogrel and aspirin respectively. The PCR products for clopidogrel were screened with agarose gel electrophoresis and then digested with SmaIfor CYP2C19*2 and Nsil-HF for CYP2C19*17. The digested products of clopidogrel and the ARMS-PCR product of aspirin were run on 2% AGE to analyze the polymorphisms.\n\nResultsIn our outcome, the percentage of hetero and mutant homozygous people in CYP2C19*2 polymorphism (loss-of-function allele) was 64.1% and for CYP2C19*17 (gain-of-function allele) was 22.3%. For ITGB3 polymorphism, it was found that 84.1% of them belonged to the homozygous group while 15.6% was heterozygous and only 0.3% were mutant homozygous patients.\n\nConclusionOur study findings were quite compatible with the results of some other studies in other ethnic groups.

    "abstract": "Hearing aids are the only available treatment for mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss, but often fail to improve perception in difficult listening conditions. To identify the reasons for this failure, we studied the underlying neural code using large-scale single-neuron recordings in gerbils, a common animal model of human hearing. We found that a hearing aid restored the sensitivity of neural responses, but failed to restore their selectivity. The low selectivity of aided responses was not a direct effect of hearing loss per se, but rather a consequence of the strategies used by hearing aids to restore sensitivity: compression, which decreases the spectral and temporal contrast of incoming sounds, and amplification, which produces high intensities that distort the neural code even with normal hearing. To improve future hearing aids, new processing strategies that avoid this tradeoff between neural sensitivity and selectivity must be developed.",

However, the association between these two modalities is still unclear. In this study, we examined the peak frequency and standard deviation of both modalities in a dataset comprising healthy young (35.5{+/-}3.4 years, N=134) and healthy old (66.9{+/-}4.8 years, N=51) adults. Both age and sex effects were examined using non-parametric analyses of variance (ANOVA) and Tukeys Honest Significant Difference (HSD) post-hoc comparisons in the cortical and subcortical regions. We found that, with age, EEG power decreases in the low frequency band (1-12 Hz) but increases in the high frequency band (12-30 Hz). Moreover, EEG frequency generally shifts up with aging. For fMRI, fluctuation amplitude is lower but fluctuation frequency is higher in older adults, but in a manner that depends on the fMRI frequency range. Furthermore, there are significant sex effects in EEG power (female > male), but the sex effect is negligible for EEG frequency as well as fMRI power and frequency. We also found that the fMRI-EEG power ratio is higher in young adults than old adults. However, the mediation analysis shows the association between EEG and fMRI parameters in aging is negligible. This is the first study that examines both power and frequency of both resting EEG and fMRI signals in the same cohort. In conclusion, both fMRI and EEG signals reflect age-related and sex-related brain differences, but they likely associate with different origins.",

    "abstract": "Zinc (Zn) is tightly regulated in plants. The MTP1/ZAT (metal tolerance protein) plays a critical role in adjusting Zn homeostasis upon Zn fluctuation in plants. This study characterizes MTP1 homologs with particular emphasis on AtMT1 in various dicot plants. The protein BLAST search was used to identify a total of 21 MTP1 proteins. Generally, all these MTP1 proteins showed around 400 residues long, six transmembrane helices, stable instability index along with cation transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0008324). These physio-chemical features of MTP1 can be utilized as a benchmark in the prediction of Zn uptake and tolerance in plants. These MTP1 homologs were located on chromosomes 2, 7, and 14 with one exon. Motif analysis showed conserved sequences of 41-50 residues belonging to the family of cation efflux, which may be helpful for binding sites targeting and transcription factor analysis. Phylogenetic studies revealed close similarities of AtZAT with Glycine max and Medicago trunculata that may infer a functional relationship in Zn tolerance or uptake across different plant species. Further, interactome analysis suggests that AtZAT is closely linked cadmium/zinc-transporting ATPase and ZIP metal ion transporter, which could provide essential background for functional genomics studies in plants. The network of AtZAT is predominantly connected to cadmium/zinc-transporting ATPase (HMA2, HMA3, HMA4), cation efflux protein (MTP11), and metal tolerance protein C3 (AT4G58060). The Genevestigator platform further predicts the high expression potential of AtMTP1 in root tissue at the germination and grain filling stage. The structural analysis of MTP1 proteins suggests the conserved N-glyco motifs as well as similar hydrophobicity, net charge and nonpolar residues, alpha-helix in all MTP1 proteins. Altogether, these in silico characterization features of MTP1 and its orthologs will provide an essential theoretical background to perform wet-lab experiments and to better understand Zn homeostasis aiming to develop genetically engineered plants.",

Methods such as virtual screening, which can filter out ineffective compounds from drug libraries prior to expensive experimental study, have become popular research topics. As the computational drug discovery community has grown, in order to benchmark the various advances in methodology, organizations such as the Drug Design Data Resource have begun hosting blinded grand challenges seeking to identify the best methods for ligand pose-prediction, ligand affinity ranking, and free energy calculations. Such open challenges offer a unique opportunity for researchers to partner with junior students (e.g., high school and undergraduate) to validate basic yet fundamental hypotheses considered to be uninteresting to domain experts. Here, we, a group of high school-aged students and their mentors, present the results of our participation in Grand Challenge 4 where we predicted ligand affinity rankings for the Cathepsin S protease, an important protein target for autoimmune diseases. To investigate the effect of incorporating receptor dynamics on ligand affinity rankings, we employed the Relaxed Complex Scheme, a molecular docking method paired with molecular dynamics-generated receptor conformations. We found that CatS is a difficult target for molecular docking and we explore some advanced methods such as distance-restrained docking to try to improve the correlation with experiments.

However, none of the studies has ever asked whether tRNAs can also be translated into peptides with any biological significance. Thus, we present a novel hypothesis which suggested that; design and synthesis of tRNA-derived peptides from prokaryotic genome can be exploited for developing unique chemotherapeutics against neglected tropical diseases, like Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and its aggressive form known as post kalazar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL). To achieve this aim, we have used a novel system biology-based strategy, which involved; i) mining of unique tRNAs from E. coli genome and their translation into peptide in silico, ii) designing of theoretical 3D models to evaluate their stability, iii) prediction of their biological activity by screening against anti-parasitic database to filter the lead peptide. Based on this strategy, a unique tRNA-derived peptide (tREP-18) was selected, chemically synthesized, and used in vitro for elucidating its therapeutic significance against L. donovani, a causative agent of VL and PKDL. Our findings demonstrated that, tREP-18 can impose high level toxicity to L. donovani promastigotes, by disrupting the ultrastructural cellular architect, destabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential ({Delta}{Psi}m), thus leading to drastic reduction in cell viability and proliferation. It also imparted high level of toxicity to BS12 a clinical isolate of PKDL. Conceivably, we for the first time reports a novel tRNA-derived peptide \"tREP18\" with excellent anti-leishmanial property, which can be further utilized for developing it as antileishmanial drug.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHere we report a novel first-in-class tRNA encoded peptide and its super anti-leishmanial characteristics.",

    "abstract": "In this pilot study, we evaluated the use of electrophysiological measures at rest as paradigm-independent predictors of L2 development for the first time in older adult learners. We then assessed EEG correlates of the learning outcome in a language-switching paradigm after the training, which to date has only been done in younger adults and at intermediate to advanced L2 proficiency.\n\nTen (Swiss) German-speaking adults between 65-74 years of age participated in an intensive three-weeks English training for beginners. A resting-state EEG was recorded before the training to predict the ensuing L2 development (Experiment 1). A language-switching ERP experiment was conducted after the training to assess the learning outcome (Experiment 2).\n\nAll participants improved their L2 skills but differed noticeably in their individual development. Experiment 1 showed that beta1 oscillations at rest (13-14.5Hz) predicted these individual differences. We interpret resting-state beta1 oscillations as correlates of attentional capacities and semantic working memory that facilitate the extraction and processing of novel forms and meanings from the L2 input. In Experiment 2, we found that language-switching from the L2 into the native language (L1) elicited an N400 component, which was reduced in the more advanced learners. Thus, for learners beginning the acquisition of an L2 in third age, language switching appears to become less effortful with increasing proficiency, suggesting that the lexicons of the L1 and L2 become more closely linked. In sum, our findings indicate that individual differences in L2 development and proficiency in older adults operate through similar electrophysiological mechanisms as those observed in younger adults.",

First, we show that systemic activation of KOR by the agonist U50,488 (U50), increases the latency to jump and the number of jumps on a cold plate at 3{degrees}C, and that the KOR antagonist NorBNI attenuates U50-induced noxious cold hypersensitivity. However, the central administration of NorBNI does not block U50-induced noxious cold hypersensitivity, suggesting that peripheral KOR may modulate this effect. To directly test this, we use the peripherally-restricted KOR agonist, ff(nle)r-NH2 and also show selective activation of peripheral KOR causes noxious cold hypersensitivity. To begin to understand how peripheral KOR drive noxious cold hypersensitivity we investigated whether KOR interact with transient receptor potential ankyrin 1(TRPA1) channels, known to facilitate the perception of noxious cold, in dorsal root ganglion (DRG). Using fluorescent in situ hybridization, we show that KOR mRNA colocalizes with the transcripts for the cold-activated TRPA1 channels in DRG. We also show a potentiation in intracellular calcium release in DRG neurons during the simultaneous application of the TRPA1 agonist, mustard oil (MO), and a KOR agonist, U50, when compared to MO alone. Together our data suggest that peripheral KOR may induce noxious cold hypersensitivity through modulation of TRPA1 channels.",

    "abstract": "Identifying the mechanism behind delayed ethanol-induced headache (DEIH), otherwise known as the hangover headache, may provide insight into the mechanisms behind common headache triggers. Acetate was previously shown to be the key ethanol metabolite behind DEIH in the recurrent inflammatory stimulation (IS) rat model of headache. The reversal of trigeminal sensitivity following ethanol exposure with caffeine previously suggested a role of adenosine in DEIH. To characterize this, behavioral analysis and measurement of brainstem adenosine and glutamate with microdialysis and HPLC was performed while pharmacologically manipulating adenosine signaling in the IS and Spontaneous Trigeminal Allodynia (STA) rat models of headache. Blocking adenosine A2A receptor activation with istradefylline or acetate transport into astrocytes with the monocarboxylate transporter competitive inhibitor, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate (4-CIN), prevented acetate-induced trigeminal sensitivity. Blocking adenosine A1, A2B, and A3 receptor signaling did not prevent trigeminal sensitivity. Compared to control rats, IS rats had greater increases in extracellular adenosine and glutamate within the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) of the brainstem during local acetate perfusion. Blocking transport of acetate into astrocytes with 4-CIN prevented the increase in adenosine and glutamate. Blocking A2A receptor activation prevented the increase in extracellular glutamate, but not adenosine in the TNC. These data are the first to demonstrate the physiological consequence of acetate on adenosinergic systems within trigeminal pain by suggesting that acetate-induced trigeminal sensitivity in DEIH is mediated by adenosine A2A receptor activation which modulates extracellular glutamate levels in the TNC.\n\nSignificance StatementIt is unknown how several common headache triggers induce headache pain. Since migraineurs are more sensitive to these triggers, studying the mechanisms behind their effects may reveal unique migraine pathophysiology. In this study, we explored the common headache trigger, ethanol, which migraineurs are particularly sensitive to. When ethanol is ingested, its quickly metabolized to acetaldehyde and subsequently into acetate. We find that acetate increases brainstem adenosine and causes trigeminal sensitivity, which is exacerbated in the rat headache model. Blocking either acetate uptake or adenosine signaling prevents trigeminal sensitivity and brainstem glutamatergic signaling, suggesting that adenosine is involved in the hangover headache and that differences in acetate metabolism may account for the increased sensitivity to ethanol in migraineurs.",

    "abstract": "Correct positioning of T cells within infected tissues is critical for T cell activation and pathogen control. Upon tissue entry, effector T cells must efficiently locate antigen presenting cells (APC) for peripheral activation. We reveal that tissue entry and initial peripheral activation of Th1 effector T cells are tightly linked to perivascular positioning of chemokine-expressing APCs. Dermal inflammation induced tissue-wide de novo generation of discrete perivascular CXCL10+ cell clusters, enriched for CD11c+MHC-II+ monocyte-derived dendritic cells. These chemokine clusters were  hot spots for both Th1 extravasation and activation in the inflamed skin. CXCR3-dependent Th1 localization to the cluster micro-environment prolonged T-APC interactions and boosted function. Both the frequency and range of these clusters were enhanced via a Th1-intrinsic, IFN{gamma}-dependent positive feedback loop. Thus, the perivascular CXCL10+ clusters act as initial peripheral activation niches, optimizing controlled activation broadly throughout the tissue by coupling Th1 tissue entry with enhanced opportunities for Th1-APC encounter.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV), from the genus flavivirus of the family flaviviridae, causes serious health problems globally. Human monoclonal antibodies (HuMAb) can be used to elucidate the mechanisms of neutralization and antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of DENV infections, leading to the development of a vaccine or therapeutic antibodies. Here, we generated eight HuMAb clones from an Indonesian patient infected with DENV. These HuMAbs exhibited the typical characteristics of weak neutralizing antibodies including high cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses and targeting of the fusion loop epitope (FLE). However, one of the HuMAbs, 3G9, exhibited strong neutralization ability (NT50 < 0.1 {micro}g/ml) and possessed a high somatic hyper-mutation rate of the variable region, indicating affinity-maturation. Administration of this antibody significantly improved the survival rate of interferon-/{beta}/{gamma} receptor knockout C57BL/6 mice after a lethal DENV challenge. Additionally, Fc-modified 3G9 molecules that had lost their in vitro ADE activity showed significantly enhanced therapeutic potency in vivo and competed strongly with an ADE-prone antibody in vitro. Taken together, the affinity-matured FLE-targeting antibody 3G9 exhibits several promising features for therapeutic application including a low NT50 value, potential for pan-flavivirus infection treatment, and suppression of ADE. This study demonstrates the therapeutic potency of affinity-matured FLE-targeting antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are a class of widely prescribed psychotropic drugs. Their anxiolytic and sedative effects are conferred by modulating the activity of GABAA receptors (GABAARs), which are the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors throughout the central nervous system. However, the physical mechanism by which BZDs exert their effects on the receptor is poorly understood. In particular, BZDs require coapplication with an agonist to effectively open the channel pore, making it difficult to dissect whether the drug has altered either agonist binding or channel gating as these two processes are intimately coupled. To isolate effects on gating we used a spontaneously active gain of function mutant (1L9T{beta}2{gamma}2L) that is directly gated by BZDs alone in the absence of agonist. In the 1L9T background we explored effects of alanine substitutions throughout the 1M2-M3 linker on modulation of the channel pore by the BZD positive modulator diazepam (DZ). The M2-M3 linker is known to be an important element for channel activation. Linker mutations generally impaired unliganded pore opening, indicating that side chain interactions are important for channel gating in the absence of bound agonist. All but one mutation had no effect on the transduction of chemical energy from DZ binding to pore gating. Strikingly, 1V279A doubles DZs energetic contribution to gating, whereas larger side chains at this site do not. In a wild-type background 1V279A enhances DZ-potentiation of currents evoked by saturating GABA, consistent with a direct effect on the pore closed/open equilibrium. Our observations identify an important residue regulating coupling between the BZD site and the pore gate, thereby shedding new light on the molecular mechanism of a frequently prescribed class of psychotropic drugs.",

Inactivating genetic variants in the UPR regulator Activating Transcription Factor 6 (ATF6) cause severe congenital heritable vision loss in patients by an unknown pathomechanism. To investigate this, we generated retinal organoids from patient iPSCs carrying ATF6 disease-causing variants and ATF6 null hESCs generated by CRISPR. Interestingly, we found that cone photoreceptor cells in ATF6 mutant retinal organoids lacked inner and outer segments concomitant with absence of cone phototransduction gene expression; while rod photoreceptors developed normally. Adaptive optics retinal imaging of patients with disease-causing variants in ATF6 also showed absence of cone inner/outer segment structures but preserved rod structures, mirroring the phenotypes observed in our retinal organoids. These results reveal that ATF6 is essential for the formation of human cone photoreceptors, and associated absence of cone phototransduction components explains the severe visual impairment in patients with ATF6 -associated retinopathy. Moreover, we show that a selective small molecule ATF6 activator compound restores the transcriptional activity of ATF6 disease-causing variants and stimulates the growth of cone photoreceptors in patient retinal organoids, demonstrating that pharmacologic targeting of ATF6 signaling is a therapeutic strategy that needs to be further explored for blinding retinal diseases.",

    "abstract": "Although tree diversity is fundamental to terrestrial ecosystems, the processes that generate it remain uncertain. Mycorrhizal type, pollination mode, and seed dispersal mode may be key drivers of tree diversity. We predicted that mycorrhizal symbiosis drove evolution of pollination and seed dispersal modes because arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations would favour long-range seed or pollen dispersal owing to their negative plant-soil-feedback effects on conspecific individuals, and ectomycorrhizal (EcM) associations would favour short-range dispersal owing to their positive effects. We analysed evolutionary relationships among mycorrhizal type, seed dispersal mode, and pollination mode in 704 tree species and conducted a meta-analysis of the dispersal distances of the various seed dispersal and pollination modes. We found evidence of joint evolution of all three features. Most AM-associated trees had endozoochorous seed dispersal and biotic pollination and these dispersal modes had long dispersal distances, whereas most EcM-associated trees had anemochorous seed dispersal and wind pollination and these dispersal modes had relatively shorter dispersal distances. Overall, evolution of mycorrhizal type, seed dispersal mode, and pollination mode were linked, strongly suggesting that mycorrhizal symbiosis drives the evolution of seed and pollination modes and contributes to tree diversification.",

    "abstract": "Haplodiploidy and paternal genome elimination (HD/PGE) are common in invertebrates, having evolved at least two dozen times, all from male heterogamety (i.e., systems with X chromosomes). However, why X chromosomes are important for the evolution of HD/PGE remains debated. The Haploid Viability Hypothesis posits that X-linked genes promote the evolution of male haploidy by facilitating purging recessive deleterious mutations. The Intragenomic Conflict Hypothesis holds that conflict between genes drives genetic system turnover; under this model, X-linked genes could promote the evolution of male haploidy due to conflicts with autosomes over sex ratios and genetic transmission. We studied lineages where we can distinguish these hypotheses: species with germline PGE that retain an XX/X0 sex determination system (gPGE+X). Because evolving PGE in these cases involves changes in transmission without increases in male hemizygosity, a high degree of X linkage in these systems is predicted by the Intragenomic Conflict Hypothesis but not the Haploid Viability Hypothesis. To quantify the degree of X linkage, we sequenced and compared 7 gPGE+X species genomes with 11 related species with typical XX/XY or XX/X0 genetic systems, representing three transitions to gPGE. We find highly increased X linkage in both modern and ancestral genomes of gPGE+X species compared to non-gPGE relatives, and recover a significant positive correlation between percent X linkage and the evolution of gPGE. These are among the first empirical results suggesting a role for intragenomic conflict in the evolution of novel genetic systems like HD/PGE.\n\nSignificance StatementSex determination systems such as haplodiploidy, in which males gene transmission is haploid, are surprisingly common, however, the evolutionary paths to these systems are poorly understood. X chromosomes may play a particularly important role, either by increasing survival of males with only maternal genomes, or due to conflicts between X-chromosomal and autosomal genes. We studied X-chromosome gene richness in three arthropod lineages in which males are diploid as adults but only transmit their maternally-inherited haploid genome. We find that species with such atypical systems have far more X chromosomal genes than related diploid species. These results suggest that conflict between genetic elements within the genome drives the evolution of unusual sex determination systems.",

Here we show that primary HGSOC spheroid models can be used to predict drug response and use them to demonstrate that somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) in frequently amplified HGSOC cancer genes significantly correlate with gene expression and drug response. These genes are often located in areas of the genome with frequent clonal SCNAs. MYC chromosomal copy number is associated with ex-vivo and clinical response to paclitaxel and ex-vivo response to mTORC1/2 inhibition. Activation of the mTOR survival pathway in the context to MYC-amplified HGSOC is mostly due to increased prevalence of SCNAs in genes from the PI3K pathway. These results suggest that SCNAs encompassing driver genes could be used to inform therapeutic response in the context of clinical trials testing personalised medicines.",
