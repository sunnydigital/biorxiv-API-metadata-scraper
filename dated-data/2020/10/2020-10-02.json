    "abstract": "The symbiotic bacteria associated with honey bee gut have likely transformed from a free-living or parasitic lifestyle, through a close evolutionary association with the insect host. However, little is known about the genomic mechanism underlying bacterial transition to exclusive adaptation to the bee gut. Here we compared the genomes of bee gut symbionts Apibacter with their close relatives living in different lifestyles. We found that despite of general reduction in the Apibacter genome, genes involved in amino acid synthesis and monosaccharide detoxification were retained, which were likely beneficial to the host. Interestingly, the microaerobic Apibacter species have specifically acquired genes encoding for the nitrate respiration (NAR). The NAR system is also conserved in the cohabiting bee microbe Snodgrassella, although with a differed structure. This convergence implies a crucial role of respiratory nitrate reduction for microaerophilic microbiomes to colonize bee gut epithelium. Genes involved in lipid, histidine degradation are substantially lost in Apibacter, indicating a transition of the energy source utilization. Particularly, genes involved in the phenylacetate degradation to generate host toxic compounds, as well as other virulence factors were lost, suggesting the loss of pathogenicity. Antibiotic resistance genes were only sporadically distributed among Apibacter species, but condensed in their pathogenic relatives, which may be related to the remotely living feature and less exposure to antibiotics of their bee hosts. Collectively, this study advances our understanding of genomic transition underlying specialization in bee gut symbionts.\n\nImportanceInvestigations aiming to uncover the genetic determinants underlying the transition to a gut symbiotic lifestyle were scarce. The vertical transmitted honey bee gut symbionts of genus Apibacter provided an rare opportunity to tackle this, as evolving from family Flavobacteriaceae, they had phylogenetic close relatives living various lifestyles. Here, we documented that Apibacter have both preserved and horizontally acquired host beneficial genes including monosaccharides detoxification that may have seeded a mutualistic relationship with the host. In contrast, multiple virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes have been lost. Importantly, an highly efficient and genomic well organized respiratory nitrate reduction pathway is conserved across all Apibacter spp., as well as in majority of Snodgrassella, which colonize the same habitat as Apibacter, suggesting an crucial role it played in living inside the gut. These findings highlight genomic changes paving ways to the transition to a honey bee gut symbiotic lifestyle.",

    "abstract": "Databases of soil pH values today guide the decisions of land managers and the experimental designs of microbiologists and biogeochemists. Soil acidity underpins fundamental properties and functions in the soil, such as the solubilities of exchangeable ions and nutrients, or bacterial use of gradients of internal and external acidity to generate ATP and turn flagellar motors. Therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising that soil pH has emerged as the strongest predictor of soil bacterial community composition. However, the measurement of these particular values today does not address whether soil pH accurately represents the in situ acidity of soil microhabitats where microorganisms survive and reproduce. This study analyzes and compares soils of a large-scale natural soil pH gradient and a long-term experimental soil pH gradient for the purposes of testing new methods of measuring and interpreting soil acidity when applied to soil ecology. We extracted and prepared soil solutions using laboratory simulation of levels of carbon dioxide and soil moisture more typical of soil conditions while also miniaturizing extraction methods using a centrifuge for extractions. The simulation of in situ soil conditions resulted in significantly different estimates of soil pH. Furthermore, for soils from the long-term experimental soil pH gradient trial, the simulated soil pH values substantially improved predictions of bacterial community composition (from R2 = 0.09 to R2 = 0.16). We offer suggestions and cautions for researchers considering how to better represent soil pH as it exists in situ.",

    "abstract": "Diatoms are predicted to synthesize certain amino acids within the chloroplast, including L-lysine via a diaminopimelate-dependent pathway. Herein, we report that the model diatom, Phaeodactylum tricornutum, possesses a chimeric lysine biosynthetic pathway, which coalesces bacterial and plant genes, and is terminated by a chloroplast-localized diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC, PtLYSA). We show that while RNAi ablation of PtLYSA is either synthetically lethal or concomitant with a slower growth rate, Cas9-mediated mutagenesis of PtLYSA results in recovery of heterozygous cells lines, suggesting that PtLYSA is an essential gene. Previously characterized DAPDCs are unique within the PLP-dependent decarboxylases where catalysis occurs at the D-stereocenter of the substrate and display a strict stereochemical preference for a (D,L)- or meso-substrate and not the D,D- or L,L-isomers of diaminopimelate (DAP) to synthesize L-lysine. Using decarboxylation assays and differential scanning calorimetry analyses, we validate that PtLYSA is a bona fide DAPDC and uncover its unexpected stereopromiscuous behavior in substrate specificity. The crystal structure of PtLYSA confirms the enzyme is an obligate homodimer in which both protomers reciprocally participate in the active site. The structure underscores features unique to the PtLYSA clan of DAPDC and provides structural insight into the determinants responsible for the substrate-promiscuity observed in PtLYSA.",

Although the choice of vector is critical, quantitative comparison of AAVs, especially in large animals, remains challenging. Here, we developed an efficient single-cell AAV engineering pipeline (scAAVengr) to quantify efficiency of AAV-mediated gene expression across all cell types. scAAVengr allows for definitive, head-to-head comparison of vectors in the same animal. To demonstrate proof-of-concept for the scAAVengr workflow, we quantified - with cell-type resolution - the abilities of naturally occurring and newly engineered AAVs to mediate gene expression in primate retina following intravitreal injection. A top performing variant, K912, was used to deliver SaCas9 and edit the rhodopsin gene in macaque retina, resulting in editing efficiency similar to infection rates detected by the scAAVengr workflow. These results validate scAAVengr as a powerful method for development of AAV vectors.",

    "abstract": "Age is a major risk factor for cancer. While the importance of age related genetic alterations in cells on cancer progression is well documented, the effect of aging extracellular matrix (ECM) has been overlooked. Here, we show for the first time that the aging breast ECM is sufficient to drive normal mammary epithelial cells (KTB21) to a more invasive and cancer-like phenotype, while promoting motility and invasiveness in MDA-MB-231 cells. E-cadherin membrane localization was lost in KTB21 cells cultured on the decellularized breast matrix from aged mice. Cell motility, cell invasion, and inflammatory cytokine and cancer-related protein production were increased significantly on the aged matrix, and many genes related to invasion were upregulated. Strikingly, we showed using single cell RNA sequencing that the aged matrix led to enrichment of a subpopulation of KTB21 cells that highly expressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion-related genes. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) knockdown reverted the aged matrix-induced changes to the young levels; LOX siRNA treatment prevented the loss of E-cadherin membrane localization, and reduced cell motility, cell invasion, and cytokine and cancer-related protein production. Finally, we showed that the biophysical, mechanical and biochemical properties of the breast ECM were altered dramatically upon aging. Analyzing these factors and studying the differential response of the epithelial cells to young and aged ECMs could lead to identification of new targets for cancer treatment and could pave the way for the discovery of new therapeutic options.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARY PARAGRAPHMaintenance of cardiac function involves a regulatory loop in which electrical excitation causes the heart to contract through excitation-contraction coupling (ECC),1 and the mechanical state of the heart directly affects its electrical activity through mechano-electric coupling (MEC).2 However, in pathological states such as acute ischaemia that alter early or late electro-mechanical coordination (i.e., disturbances in ECC or repolarisation-relaxation coupling, RRC), MEC may contribute to the initiation and / or sustenance of arrhythmias (mechano-arrhythmogenesis).3 The molecular identity of specific factor(s) underlying mechano-arrhythmogenesis in acute ischaemia, however, remain undefined.4 By rapid stretch of rabbit single left ventricular cardiomyocytes, we show that upon ATP-sensitive potassium channel-induced alterations of RRC, overall vulnerability to mechano-arrhythmogenesis is increased, with mechano-sensitive5-11 transient receptor potential kinase ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) channels12 acting as the molecular driver through a Ca2+-mediated mechanism. Specifically, TRPA1 activation drives stretch-induced excitation and creates a substrate for self-sustained arrhythmias, which are maintained by increased cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and spontaneous [Ca2+]i oscillations. This TRPA1-dependent mechano-arrhythmogenesis involves microtubules, and can be prevented by block of TRPA1 or buffering of [Ca2+]i. Thus, in cardiac pathologies with disturbed RRC dynamics and / or augmented TRPA1 activity, TRPA1 may represent an anti-arrhythmic target with untapped therapeutic potential.13-17",

    "abstract": "Meiotic recombination (MR) drives novel combination of alleles and contributes to genomic diversity in eukaryotes. In this study, we showed that heat stress (36-38{degrees}C) over fertile threshold fully abolished crossover (CO) formation in Arabidopsis. Cytological and genetic studies in wild-type plants, and the syn1 and rad51 mutants suggested that heat stress reduces generation of SPO11-dependent double-strand breaks (DSBs). In support, the abundance of recombinase DMC1, which is required for MR-specific DSB repair, was significantly reduced under heat stress. In addition, we showed that high temperatures induced disassembly and/or instability of ASY4-but not SYN1-mediated chromosome axis. At the same time, ASY1-associated lateral element of synaptonemal complex (SC) was partially affected, while the ZYP1-dependent central element of SC was disrupted, indicating that heat stress impairs SC formation. Moreover, quantitative RT-PCR revealed that genes involved in DSB formation; e.g. SPO11-1, PRD1, 2 and 3, were not impacted; however, recombinase RAD51 and chromosome axis factors ASY3 and ASY4 were significantly downregulated under heat stress. Taken together, these findings revealed that heat stress inhibits MR via compromised DSB formation and homolog synapsis, which are possible downstream effects of the impacted chromosome axis. Our study thus provides evidence shedding light on how increase of environmental temperature influences MR in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "The proper storage and release of monoamines contributes to a wide range of neuronal activity. Here, we examine the effects of altered vesicular monoamine transport in the nematode C. elegans. The gene cat-1 is responsible for the encoding of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT) in C. elegans and is analogous to the mammalian vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Our laboratory has previously shown that reduced VMAT2 activity confers vulnerability on catecholamine neurons in mice. The purpose of this paper was to determine whether this function is conserved and to determine the impact of reduced VMAT activity in C. elegans. Here we show that deletion of cat-1/VMAT increases sensitivity to the neurotoxicant 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) as measured by enhanced degeneration of dopamine neurons. Reduced cat-1/VMAT also induces changes in dopamine-mediated behaviors. High-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics in the whole organism reveals changes in amino acid metabolism, including tyrosine metabolism in the cat-1/VMAT mutants. Treatment with MPP+ disrupted tryptophan metabolism. Both conditions altered glycerophospholipid metabolism, suggesting a convergent pathway of neuronal dysfunction. Our results demonstrate the evolutionarily conserved nature of monoamine function in C. elegans and further suggest that HRMS-based metabolomics can be used in this model to study environmental and genetic contributors to complex human disease",

Although the liver generates most HDL in blood, HDL synthesis also occurs in the small intestine. However, distinct functions for intestinal HDL are unknown. Here we show that HDL in the portal vein, which connects intestine to liver, derivesd mainly from intestine and potently neutralizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In a mouse model of short bowel syndrome where liver inflammation and fibrosis was driven by the LPS receptor TLR4, loss of intestine-derived HDL worsened liver injury, whereas liver status was improved by therapeutics that elevated and depended upon intestinal HDL production. Thus, protection of the liver from injury in response to gut-derived signals like LPS is a major function of intestinally synthesized HDL.",

    "abstract": "Increasing problems with antibiotic resistance has directed interest towards phages as tools to treat bacterial infections in the aquaculture industry. However, phage resistance evolves rapidly in bacteria posing a challenge for successful phage therapy. To investigate phage resistance in the fish pathogenic bacterium Flavobacterium columnare, two phage-sensitive, virulent wild-type isolates, FCO-F2 and FCO-F9, were exposed to phages and subsequently analyzed for bacterial viability and colony morphology. Twenty-four phage-exposed isolates were further characterized for phage resistance, antibiotic susceptibility, motility, adhesion and biofilm formation on polystyrene surface, protease activity, whole genome sequencing and virulence against rainbow trout fry. Bacterial viability first decreased in the exposure cultures, subsequently increasing after 1-2 days. Simultaneously, the colony morphology of the phage-exposed isolates changed from original rhizoid to rough. The rough isolates arising in phage exposure were phage-resistant with low virulence, whereas rhizoid isolates maintained phage sensitivity, though reduced, and high virulence. Gliding motility and protease activity were also related to the phage sensitivity. Observed genetic mutations in phage-resistant isolates were mostly located in genes coding for type IX secretion system, a component of the flavobacterial gliding motility machinery. However, there were mutational differences between individual isolates, and not all phage-resistant isolates had genetic mutations. This indicates that development of phage resistance in F. columnare probably is a multifactorial process including both genetic mutations and changes in gene expression. Phage resistance may not, however, be a challenge for development of phage therapy against F. columnare infections, since phage resistance is associated with decrease in bacterial virulence.\n\nImportancePhage resistance of infectious bacteria is a common phenomenon posing challenges for development of phage therapy. Along with growing World population and need for increased food production, constantly intensifying animal farming has to face increasing problems of infectious diseases. Columnaris disease, caused by F. columnare, is a worldwide threat for salmonid fry and juvenile farming. Without antibiotic treatments, infections can lead to 100% mortality in a fish stock. Phage therapy of columnaris disease would reduce a development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic loads by the aquaculture industry, but phage-resistant bacterial isolates may become a risk. However, phenotypic and genetic characterization of phage-resistant F. columnare isolates in this study revealed that they are less virulent than phage-sensitive isolates and thus not a challenge for phage therapy against columnaris disease. This is a valuable information for the fish farming industry globally when considering phage-based prevention and curing methods for F. columnare infections.",

Here we have established a robust and simple S. aureus oral infection model, using Drosophila melanogaster larva, which allowed to follow S. aureus fate at the whole organism level as well as the host immune responses. Fluorescence microscopy and Light sheet 3D imaging revealed bacterial clustering at the posterior midgut that displays neutral pH. Our study demonstrates that S. aureus infection triggers host H2O2 production through Duox enzyme, consequently empowering antimicrobial peptides production through Toll pathway activation. We also show that catalase-mediated quenching of H2O2 not only enhances S. aureus survival but also minimizes host antimicrobial response, hence reducing bacterial clearance in vivo. Finally, we confirm the versatility of this model by demonstrating the colonization and host stimulation capacities of two other bacterial pathogens: Salmonella Typhimurium and Shigella flexneri. Overall, the drosophila larva may constitute a general model to follow in vivo host innate immune responses triggered upon infection with human pathogens.",

    "abstract": "An outbreak of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), a respiratory disease, has infected over 34,000,000 people since the end of 2019, killed over 1,000,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption. Due to the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection to host cells and its pathogenesis remain largely unclear, there are currently no antiviral drugs with proven efficacy nor are there vaccines for its prevention. Besides severe respiratory and systematic symptoms, several comorbidities may also increase risk of fatal disease outcome. Therefore, it is required to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on pre-existing diseases of patients, such as cancer and other infectious diseases. In the current study, we have reported that SARS-CoV-2 encoded proteins and some anti-COVID-19 drugs currently used are able to induce lytic reactivation of Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), one of major human oncogenic viruses through manipulation of intracellular signaling pathways. Our data indicate that those KSHV+ patients especially in endemic areas exposure to COVID-19 or undergoing the treatment may have increased risks to develop virus-associated cancers, even after they have fully recovered from COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a lysosome-dependent degradative process involving over 35 Atg proteins. The autophagy repertoire in malaria parasites is limited and does not appear to be a major degradative process. To better understand the autophagy process, we investigated Plasmodium falciparum Atg18 (PfAtg18), a PROPPIN family protein, whose members like S. cerevisiae Atg18 (ScAtg18) and human WIPI2 are essential for autophagy. Wild type and mutant PfAtg18 were expressed in P. falciparum and assessed for localization, the effect of various inhibitors and antimalarials on PfAtg18 localization, and identification of PfAtg18-interacting proteins. PfAtg18 is expressed in asexual erythrocytic stages and localized to the food vacuole, which was also observed with other Plasmodium Atg18 proteins, indicating that food vacuole localization is a conserved feature. Interaction of PfAtg18 with the food vacuole-associated PI3P is essential for localization, as PfAtg18 mutants of PI3P-binding motifs neither bound PI3P nor localized to the food vacuole. Interestingly, ScAtg18 showed complete cytoplasmic localization despite binding with PI3P, indicating additional requirement for PfAtg18 localization. The food vacuole multi-drug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) was consistently identified in the PfAtg18 immunoprecipitate, and also interacted with PfAtg18. In contrast to PfAtg18, ScAtg18 did not interact with the MDR1, which, in addition to PI3P, could play a critical role in localization of PfAtg18. Chloroquine and amodiaquine greatly affected PfAtg18 localization, suggesting that these quinolines target PfAtg18 or the proteins that might be involved in its localization. Thus, PI3P and MDR1are critical mediators of PfAtg18 localization, and PfAtg18 may modulate MDR1 activity.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial cells possess intrinsic mechanisms to maintain an appropriate cell density for normal tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis. Defects in such mechanisms likely contribute to hyperplasia and cancer initiation. To identify genes that regulate the density-dependent proliferation of murine mammary epithelial cells, we developed a fluorescence-activated cell sorting assay based on FUCCI, which marks different stages of the cell cycle with distinct fluorophores. Using this powerful assay, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screen, selecting for cells that proliferate normally at low density but continue to divide at high density. Unexpectedly, one top hit was Traf3, a negative regulator of NF-{kappa}B signaling that has never previously been linked to density-dependent proliferation. We demonstrate that loss of Traf3 specifically activates non-canonical NF-{kappa}B signaling. This in turn triggers an innate immune response and drives cell division independently of known density-dependent proliferation mechanisms, including YAP/TAZ signaling and cyclin kinase inhibitors, by blocking entry into quiescence.",

To understand how embryos breach the endometrial epithelium, we modelled human implantation using blastocysts or trophoblast stem cell spheroids cultured with endometrial epithelial cells (EEC). Blastocyst invasion of the EEC layer was initiated by multinuclear syncytiotrophoblast. Spheroids also invaded the epithelium with syncytiotrophoblast, and EEC induced upregulation of syncytiotrophoblast markers. Modelling implantation in silico using blastocyst and EEC transcriptomes revealed gene networks that exhibited greater connectivity and organisation in trophectoderm of the polar region of the embryonic axis. However, gene ontologies and machine learning suggested that EEC drives syncytiotrophoblast differentiation in polar and mural trophectoderm. This is the first evidence for endometrial epithelium-induced trophectoderm differentiation to invasive syncytiotrophoblast as the cellular mechanism of embryonic breaching of the endometrium in humans, with implications for reproductive medicine and our understanding of human embryonic development.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algae can have profound economic, environmental, and social consequences. As the timing, frequency, and severity of harmful algal blooms (HABs) change alongside global climate, efficient tools to monitor and understand the current ecological context of these taxa are increasingly important. Here we employ environmental DNA metabarcoding to identify patterns in a wide variety of harmful algae and associated ecological communities in the Hood Canal of Puget Sound in Washington State, USA. We track trends of presence and abundance in a series of water samples across nearly two years. We find putative harmful algal sequences in a majority of samples, suggesting that these groups are routinely present in local waters. We report patterns in variants of the economically important genus Pseudo-nitzschia (family Bacillariaceae), as well as multiple harmful algal taxa previously unknown or poorly documented in the region, including a cold-water variant from the saxitoxin-producing genus Alexandrium (family Gonyaulacaceae), two variants from the karlotoxin-producing genus Karlodinium (family Kareniaceae), and one variant from the parasitic genus Hematodinium (family Syndiniaceae). We then use data on environmental variables and the biological community surrounding each algal taxon to illustrate the ecological context in which these species are commonly found. Environmental DNA metabarcoding thus simultaneously (1) alerts us to potential new or cryptic occurrences of harmful algae, (2) expands our knowledge of the co-occurring conditions and species associated with the growth of these organisms in changing marine environments, and (3) provides a tool for monitoring and management moving forward.",

    "abstract": "The endosymbiosis of the bacterial progenitors of mitochondrion and the chloroplast are landmark events in the evolution of life on earth. While both organelles have retained substantial proteomic and biochemical complexity, this complexity is not reflected in the content of their genomes. Instead, the organellar genomes encode fewer than 5% of genes found in living relatives of their ancestors. While many of the 95% of missing organellar genes have been discarded, others have been transferred to the host nuclear genome through a process known as endosymbiotic gene transfer. Here we demonstrate that the difference in the per-cell copy number of the organellar and nuclear genomes presents an energetic incentive to the cell to either delete genes or transfer them to the nuclear genome. We show that, for the majority transferred genes, the energy saved by nuclear-transfer exceeds the costs incurred from importing the encoded protein into the organelle where it can provide its function. Finally, we show that the net energy saved by endosymbiotic gene transfer can constitute an appreciable proportion of total cellular energy budgets, and is therefore sufficient to impart a selectable advantage to the cell. Thus, reduced cellular cost and improved energy efficiency likely played a role in the reductive evolution of mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes and the transfer of organellar genes to the nuclear genome.\n\nSignificance statementThe endosymbioses of the mitochondrion and the chloroplast were each followed by substantial gene loss and transfer of organellar genes to the nuclear genome. Here we show that the high per-cell copy number of these organellar genomes creates an energetic incentive for the cell to discard genes or transfer them to the nuclear genome. Thus, organellar gene loss and endosymbiotic gene transfer can be intrinsically advantageous to the cell.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic relationships between bioluminescent bacteria and fishes have evolved multiple times across hundreds of fish taxa, but relatively little is known about the specificity of these associations and how conserved they have been through time. This study describes the degree of specificity of a bioluminescent symbiosis between cardinalfishes in the genus Siphamia and luminous bacteria in the Vibrio family. Primarily using museum specimens, we investigate the co-divergence of host and symbiont and test for patterns of divergence that correlate with both biogeography and time. Contrary to expectations, we determined that the light organ symbionts of all 14 Siphamia species examined belong to one genetic clade of Photobacterium mandapamensis (Clade II), indicating that the association is highly specific and conserved across the host genus. Thus, we did not find evidence of codivergence among hosts and symbionts. We did observe that symbionts hosted by individuals sampled from colder water regions were more divergent, containing more than three times as many single nucleotide polymorphisms than the rest of the symbionts examined. Overall our findings indicate that the symbiosis between Siphamia fishes and P. mandapamensis Clade II has been highly conserved across a broad geographic range and through time despite the facultative nature of the bacterial symbiont. These results suggest that this bioluminescent symbiosis could have played a key role in the evolution of the host genus and that there are conserved mechanisms regulating its specificity that have yet to be defined.",

Here, we explore the effects of CAR protein sequence and structure on CAR-T cell function. Based on the empirical observation that CD20 CARs with similar sequences exhibit divergent tonic-signaling and anti-tumor activities, we devised engineering strategies that aimed to improve CAR-T cell function by tuning the intensity of tonic signaling. We found that CARs designed to exhibit low but non-zero levels of tonic signaling show robust effector function upon antigen stimulation while avoiding premature functional exhaustion by CAR-T cells. Through alterations of the CARs ligand-binding domain and overall protein conformation, we generated CD20 CAR variants that outperform the CD19 CAR in mouse models of human lymphoma. We further demonstrate that rational modification of protein confirmation can be generalized to improve GD2 CAR-T cell efficacy against neuroblastoma. These findings point to tonic signaling and basal T-cell activation as informative parameters to guide the rational design of next-generation CARs for cancer therapy.",

However, the fat used in most infant formulas is derived from plants, which preferentially esterify 16:0 to the outer positions. We have previously showed that the metabolism of the model oilseed Arabidopsis thaliana can be engineered to incorporate 16:0 into the middle position of TG. However, the fatty acyl composition of Arabidopsis seed TG does not mimic human milk, which is rich in both 16:0 and 18:1 and is defined by the high abundance of the TG molecular species 1,3-olein-2-palmitin (OPO). Here we have constructed an Arabidopsis fatty acid biosynthesis 1-1 fatty acid desaturase 2 fatty acid elongase 1 mutant with around 20% 16:0 and ~70% 18:1 in its seeds and we have engineered it to esterify more than 80% of the 16:0 to the middle position of TG, using heterologous expression of the human lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase isoform AGPAT1, combined with suppression of LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID ACYLTRANSFERASE 2 and PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE:DIACYLGLYCEROL CHOLINEPHOSPHOTRANSFERASE. Our data suggest that oilseeds can be engineered to produce TG that is rich in OPO, which is an important structured fat ingredient used in infant formulas.",

    "abstract": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathies (HCMs) are the leading cause of acute cardiac failure in young individuals. Over 300 mutations throughout {beta}-cardiac myosin, including in the motor domain, are associated with HCM. A {beta}-cardiac myosin motor mutation (R712L) leads to a severe form of HCM. Actin-gliding motility of R712L-myosin is inhibited, despite near normal ATPase kinetics. By optical trapping, the working stroke of R712L-myosin was decreased 4-fold, but actin-attachment durations were normal. A prevalent hypothesis that HCM mutants are hypercontractile is thus not universal. R712 is adjacent to the binding site of the heart failure drug omecamtiv mecarbil (OM). OM suppresses the working stroke of normal {beta}-cardiac myosin, but remarkably, OM rescues the R712L-myosin working stroke. Using a flow chamber to interrogate a single molecule during buffer exchange, we found OM rescue to be reversible. Thus, the R712L mutation uncouples lever arm rotation from ATPase activity and this inhibition is rescued by OM.",

    "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an aggressive pediatric tumor with poor prognosis for metastasis and recurrent disease. Large scale sequencing endeavors demonstrate that RMS tumors have limited mutations and a dearth of driver mutations that are precisely targetable. However, IGF2 signaling is known to be grossly altered in RMS. The IGF2 signalling molecule binds both its innate IGF1 receptor as well as the insulin-receptor-variant-A (IR-A) with high affinity. Mitogenic and proliferative signalling via the canonical IGF2 pathway is therefore augmented by IR-A. The insulin receptor (IR) which is a transmembrane tyrosine-kinase receptor exists in two alternatively spliced isoforms, IR-A and IR-B. In this study, we show that RMS patients express increased IR-A compared to control tissues that express predominantly the IR-B isoform. We also found that Hif1a is significantly increased in RMS tumors, portraying their hypoxic phenotype. Furthermore, the alternative-splicing of IR adapts to produce more IR-A in response to hypoxic stress. Upon examining the pre-mRNA structure of the gene, we identified a hypoxia-responsive-element, which is also the binding site for the RNA-binding protein CUG-BP1. We designed Splice-Switching-Oligonucleotides (SSO) against this binding site to decrease the levels of IR-A in RMS cell-lines and consequently rescue the IR-B expression levels. SSO treatment resulted in significant reductions in proliferation, migration and angiogenesis. Our data show promising insight into how impeding the IGF-2 pathway by reducing IR-A expression mitigates tumor growth. Our data reveal that RMS tumors use IR alternative-splicing as yet another survival strategy which can be exploited as therapeutic intervention in conjunction with already established anti-IGF-1 receptor therapies.",

It consists of an asymmetrical lipid bilayer made up of three different lipid classes: sphingolipids, sterols and phospholipids. The most abundant sphingolipids in the plant PM are the Glycosyl Inositol Phosphoryl Ceramides (GIPCs), representing up to 40% of total sphingolipids, assumed to be almost exclusively in the outer leaflet of the PM. In this study, we investigated the structure of GIPCs and their role in membrane organization. Since GIPCs are not commercially available, we developed a protocol to extract and isolate GIPC-enriched fractions from eudicots (cauliflower and tobacco) and monocots (leek and rice). Lipidomic analysis confirmed the presence of different long chain bases and fatty acids. The glycan head groups of the different GIPC series from monocots and dicots were analysed by GC-MS showing different sugar moieties. Multiple biophysics tools namely Langmuir monolayer, {zeta}-Potential, light scattering, neutron reflectivity, solid state 2H-NMR and molecular modelling were used to investigate the physical properties of the GIPCs, as well as their interaction with free and conjugated phytosterols. We showed that GIPCs increase the thickness and electronegativity of model membranes, interact differentially with the phytosterols species and regulate the gel-to-fluid phase transition during temperature variations.",

    "abstract": "General anesthesia is critical to modern medicine and animal research, but the cellular and molecular actions of general anesthetics on the central nervous system remain poorly understood. Volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane disrupt synaptic transmission and inhibit synaptic vesicle release in a neurotransmitter-selective manner. For example, GABA release from interneurons is less sensitive to isoflurane inhibition than are glutamate or dopamine release. Hippocampal and cortical interneuron subpopulations have diverse neurophysiological and synaptic properties, and their individual subtype-specific responses to isoflurane are unknown. We used live-cell optical imaging of exocytosis using fluorescent biosensors expressed in transgenic mouse hippocampal neuron cultures to delineate interneuron subtype-specific effects of isoflurane on synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We found that a clinically relevant concentration of isoflurane (0.5 mM) differentially modulated action potential-mediated exocytosis from GABAergic interneurons: parvalbumin-expressing interneurons were inhibited to 83.1{+/-}11.7% of control, whereas somatostatin-expressing and interneurons glutamatergic neurons were inhibited to 58.6{+/-}13.3% and 64.5{+/-}8.5% of control, respectively. The role of presynaptic voltage-gated sodium channel (Nav) subtype expression in determining isoflurane sensitivity was probed by overexpression or knockdown of specific Nav subtypes, which have distinct sensitivities to isoflurane and are differentially expressed between glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons. We found that the sensitivity of exocytosis to isoflurane was determined by the relative expression of Nav1.1 (associated with lower sensitivity) and Nav1.6 (associated with higher sensitivity). Thus the selective effects of isoflurane on synaptic vesicle exocytosis from hippocampal interneuron subtypes is determined by synaptic diversity in the relative expression of Nav1.1 and Nav1.6.\n\nSignificance statementThe volatile anesthetic isoflurane inhibits hippocampal GABAergic interneuron synaptic vesicle exocytosis with differences in potency between interneuron subtypes. This neuron subtype-specific pharmacology derives in part from synaptic diversity in the expression of presynaptic voltage-gated sodium channels that have different sensitivities to anesthetic modulation of channel function. GABAergic interneurons are generally more resistant to the presynaptic effects of isoflurane owing to predominant Nav1.1 expression, whereas glutamatergic neurons are more sensitive owing to predominant Nav1.6 expression, which supports heterogenous pharmacologic effects on specific neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is an increasing threat for public health, underscoring the need for new antibacterial agents. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent an alternative to classical antibiotics. TAT-RasGAP317-326 is a recently described AMP effective against a broad range of bacteria, but little is known about the conditions that may influence its activity. Using RNA-sequencing and screening of mutant libraries, we show that Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa respond to TAT-RasGAP317-326 by regulating metabolic and stress response pathways, possibly implicating two-component systems. Our results also indicate that bacterial surface properties, in particular integrity of the lipopolysaccharide layer, influence peptide binding and entry. Finally, we found differences between bacterial species with respect to their rate of resistance emergence against this peptide. Our findings provide the basis for future investigation on the mode of action of this peptide and its potential clinical use as an antibacterial agent.",

    "abstract": "Preserving optimal mitochondrial function is critical in the heart, which is the most ATP-avid organ in the body. Recently, we showed that global deficiency of the nuclear receptor ROR in the \"staggerer\" (RORsg/sg) mouse exacerbates angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertrophy and compromises cardiomyocyte mitochondrial function. The mechanisms underlying these observations have not been defined. Here we present evidence that ROR regulates cardiomyocyte mitophagy using pharmacological and genetic gain- and loss-of-function tools, including a novel cardiomyocyte-specific ROR knockout mouse. Cardiomyocyte ROR is upregulated by hypoxia and the loss of ROR blunts hypoxia-induced mitophagy and broadly compromises mitochondrial function. We show that ROR is a direct transcriptional regulator of the mitophagy mediator caveolin-3 in cardiomyocytes and that increased expression of ROR increases caveolin-3 abundance and enhances mitophagy. Knockdown of ROR impairs cardiomyocyte mitophagy, but this defect can be rescued by caveolin-3 overexpression. Collectively, these findings reveal a novel role for ROR in regulating mitophagy through caveolin-3 and expand our currently limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying ROR-mediated cardioprotection.",

    "abstract": "Like many viruses, Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) has a high nutation rate, which helps the virus adapt quickly, but mutations come with fitness costs. Fitness costs can be studied by different approaches, such as experimental or frequency-based approaches. The frequency-based approach is particularly useful to estimate in vivo fitness costs, but this approach works best with deep sequencing data from many hosts, are. In this study, we applied the frequency-based approach to a large dataset of 195 patients and estimated the fitness costs of mutations at 7957 sites along the HCV genome. We used beta regression and random forest models to better understand how different factors influenced fitness costs. Our results revealed that costs of nonsynonymous mutations were three times higher than those of synonymous mutations, and mutations at nucleotides A or T had higher costs than those at C or G. Genome location had a modest effect, with lower costs for mutations in HVR1 and higher costs for mutations in Core and NS5B. Resistance mutations were, on average, costlier than other mutations. Our results show that in vivo fitness costs of mutations can be virus specific, reinforcing the utility of constructing in vivo fitness cost maps of viral genomes.\n\nAuthor SummaryUnderstanding how viruses evolve within patients is important for combatting viral diseases, yet studying viruses within patients is difficult. Laboratory experiments are often used to understand the evolution of viruses, in place of assessing the evolution in natural populations (patients), but the dynamics will be different. In this study, we aimed to understand the within-patient evolution of Hepatitis C virus, which is an RNA virus that replicates and mutates extremely quickly, by taking advantage of high-throughput next generation sequencing. Here, we describe the evolutionary patterns of Hepatitis C virus from 195 patients: We analyzed mutation frequencies and estimated how costly each mutation was. We also assessed what factors made a mutation more costly, including the costs associated with drug resistance mutations. We were able to create a genome-wide fitness map of within-patient mutations in Hepatitis C virus which proves that, with technological advances, we can deepen our understanding of within-patient viral evolution, which can contribute to develop better treatments and vaccines.",

Its role in allowing cells to survive replicative stress has made it an important target for anti-cancer drug discovery. Activation of CHK1 by ATR depends on their mutual interaction with CLASPIN - a natively unstructured protein that interacts with CHK1 through a cluster of phosphorylation sites in its C-terminal half. We have now determined the crystal structure of the kinase domain of CHK1 bound to a high-affinity motif from CLASPIN. Our data show that CLASPIN engages a conserved site on CHK1 adjacent to the substrate-binding cleft, involved in phosphate sensing in other kinases. The CLASPIN motif is not phosphorylated by CHK1, nor does it affect phosphorylation of a CDC25 substrate peptide, suggesting that it functions purely as a scaffold for CHK1 activation by ATR.",

    "abstract": "Proper brain development and function requires finely controlled mechanisms for protein turnover and disruption of genes involved in proteostasis is a common cause of neurodevelopmental disorders. Kelch-like 15 (KLHL15) is a substrate adaptor for cullin3 (Cul3)-containing E3 ubiquitin ligases and KLHL15 gene mutations were recently described as a cause of severe X-linked intellectual disability. Here, we used a bioinformatics approach to identify a family of neuronal microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) as KLHL15 substrates, which are themselves critical for early brain development. We biochemically validated doublecortin (DCX), also an X-linked disease gene, and doublecortin-like kinases 1 and 2 (DCLK1/2) as bona fide KLHL15 interactors and mapped KLHL15 interaction regions to their tandem DCX domains. Shared with two previously identified KLHL15 substrates, a FRY tripeptide at the C-terminal edge of the second DCX domain is necessary for KLHL15-mediated ubiquitination of DCX and DCLK1/2 and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Conversely, silencing endogenous KLHL15 markedly stabilizes these DCX domain-containing proteins and prolongs their half-life. Functionally, overexpression of KLHL15 in the presence of wild-type DCX reduces dendritic complexity of cultured hippocampal neurons, whereas neurons expressing FRY-mutant DCX are resistant to KLHL15. Collectively, our findings highlight the critical importance of the E3 ubiquitin ligase adaptor KLHL15 in proteostasis of neuronal MAPs and identify a regulatory network important for development of the mammalian nervous system.",

    "abstract": "CLC-0, a prototype Cl- channel in the CLC family, employs two gating mechanisms that control its ion-permeation pore: fast gating and slow gating. The negatively-charged sidechain of a pore glutamate residue, E166, is known to be the fast gate, and the swinging of this sidechain opens or closes the pore of CLC-0 on the millisecond time scale. The other gating mechanism, slow gating, operates with much slower kinetics in the range of seconds to tens or even hundreds of seconds, and it is thought to involve still-unknown conformational rearrangements. Here, we find that low intracellular pH (pHi) facilitates the closure of the CLC-0s slow gate, thus generating current inhibition. The rate of low pHi-induced current inhibition increases with intracellular H+ concentration ([H+]i)--the time constants of current inhibition by low pHi = 4.5, 5.5 and 6 are roughly 0.1, 1 and 10 sec, respectively, at room temperature. In comparison, the time constant of the slow gate closure at pHi = 7.4 at room temperature is hundreds of seconds. The inhibition by low pHi is significantly less prominent in mutants favoring the slow-gate open state (such as C212S and Y512A), further supporting the fact that intracellular H+ enhances the slow-gate closure in CLC-0. A fast inhibition by low pHi causes an apparent inverted voltage-dependent activation in the wild-type CLC-0, a behavior similar to those in some channel mutants such as V490W in which only membrane hyperpolarization can open the channel. Interestingly, when V490W mutation is constructed in the background of C212S or Y512A mutation, the inverted voltage-dependent activation disappears. We propose that the slow kinetics of CLC-0s slow-gate closure may be due to low [H+]i rather than due to the proposed large conformational change of the channel protein. Our results also suggest that the inverted voltage-dependent opening observed in some mutant channels may result from fast closure of the slow gate by the mutations.",

    "abstract": "As the emergence of bacterial resistance is outpacing the development of new antibiotics, we must find cost-effective and innovative approaches to discover new antibacterial therapeutics. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent one promising solution to fill this void, since they generally undergo faster development, display rapid onsets of killing, and most importantly, show lower risks of induced resistance. Despite prior success in AMP design with physics- and/or knowledge-based approaches, an efficient approach to precisely design peptides with high activity and selectivity is still lacking. Toward this goal, we have invented a novel approach which utilizes a generative model to predict AMP-like sequences, followed by molecular modeling to rank the candidates. Thus, we can identify peptides with desirable sequences, structures, and potential specific interactions with bacterial membranes. For the proof of concept, we curated a dataset that comprises 500,000 non-AMP peptide sequences and nearly 8,000 labeled AMP sequences to train the generative model. For 12 generated peptides that are cationic and likely helical, we assessed the membrane binding propensity via extensive all-atom molecular simulations. The top six peptides were promoted for synthesis, chemical characterizations, and antibacterial assays, showing various inhibition to bacterial growth. Three peptides were validated with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. In aggregate, the combination of AMP generator and sophisticated molecular modeling affords enhanced speed and accuracy in AMP design. Our approach and results demonstrate the viability of a generative approach to develop novel AMPs and to help contain the rise of antibiotic resistant microbes.",

    "abstract": "Efficient neural transmission is crucial for optimal brain function, yet the plastic potential of white matter (WM) has long been overlooked. Growing evidence now shows that modifications to axons and myelin occur not only as a result of long-term learning, but also after short training periods. Motor sequence learning (MSL), a common paradigm used to study neuroplasticity, occurs in overlapping learning stages and different neural circuits are involved in each stage. However, most studies investigating short-term WM plasticity have used a pre-post design, in which the temporal dynamics of changes across learning stages cannot be assessed. In this study, we used multiple magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at 7 Tesla to investigate changes in WM in a group learning a complex visuomotor sequence (LRN) and in a control group (SMP) performing a simple sequence, for 5 consecutive days. Consistent with behavioral results, where most improvements occurred between the two first days, structural changes in WM were observed only in the early phase of learning (d1-d2), and in overall learning (d1-d5). In LRNs, WM microstructure was altered in the tracts underlying the primary motor and sensorimotor cortices. Moreover, our structural findings in WM were related to changes in functional connectivity, assessed with resting-state functional MRI data in the same cohort, through analyses in regions of interest (ROIs). Significant changes in WM microstructure were found in a ROI underlying the right supplementary motor area. Together, our findings provide evidence for highly dynamic WM plasticity in the sensorimotor network during short-term MSL.",

Consequentially, knowledge about the neural representation of abstract choices is sparse, and choices are often thought to evolve as motor intentions. Here, we show that in the human brain, perceptual choices are represented in an abstract, motor-independent manner, even when they are directly linked to an action. We measured MEG signals while participants made choices with known or unknown motor response mapping. Using multivariate decoding, we quantified stimulus, perceptual choice and motor response information with distinct cortical distributions. Choice representations were invariant to whether the response mapping was known during stimulus presentation, and they occupied distinct representational spaces from both stimulus and motor signals. Furthermore, their strength predicted decision confidence and accuracy, as expected from an internal decision variable. Our results uncover abstract neural choice signals that generalize to action-linked decisions, suggesting a general role of an abstract choice stage in human decision-making.",

    "abstract": "The intestinal microbiota closely interacts with the neuroendocrine system and exerts profound effects on host physiology. Many of the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions await discovery. Here we report that Nod1 ligand derived from intestinal bacteria directly modulates catecholamine storage and secretion in mouse adrenal chromaffin cells. The cytosolic peptidoglycan receptor Nod1 is involved in chromogranin A (CHGA) retention in dense core granules (DCGs) in chromaffin cells in a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, upon recognizing its cognate ligands, Nod1 localizes to DCGs, and recruits Rab2a, which is critical for CHGA retention in DCGs. Loss of Nod1 ligands leads to a profound defect in epinephrine storage in chromaffin cells, and subsequently, less secretion upon stimulation. The intestine-adrenal medulla crosstalk bridged by Nod1 ligands modulates adrenal medullary responses during the immobilization-induced stress response in mice. Thus, our study uncovers a mechanism by which intestinal microbes directly modulate a major pathway in response to stress, which may provide further understanding of the gut-brain axis.",

These responses are measured in blood samples obtained from squirrel monkeys, at different time points relative to their relocation from their old home to their new home. A variety of immunological assays are performed on the phenotype and function of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a group of squirrel monkeys that were transported by road for approximately 10 hours from one facility to another. Using a panel of human antibodies and a set of standardized human immune assays, we evaluated the phenotype of lymphocyte subsets by flow, mitogen-specific immune responses of PBMCs in vitro, and levels of cytokines at various time points including immediately before transport, immediately upon arrival, and after approximately 150 days of acclimation. We observed significant changes in T cells and subsets, NK and B cells (CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+, CD16+, and CD20+). Mitogen specific (e.g. PHA, PWM and LPS) proliferation responses, IFN-g by ELISPOT assay, and cytokines (IL-2, IL-4 and VEGF) significant changes were observed.

    "abstract": "The leafhopper Euscelidius variegatus is a natural vector of the chrysanthemum yellows phytoplasma (CYp) and a laboratory vector of the Flavescence doree phytoplasma (FDp). Previous studies indicated a crucial role for insect ATP synthase  and {beta} subunits during phytoplasma infection of the vector species. Gene silencing of ATP synthase {beta} was obtained by injection of specific dsRNAs in E. variegatus. Here we present the systemic and long-lasting nature of such silencing, its effects on the small RNA profile, the significant reduction of the corresponding protein expression, and the impact on phytoplasma acquisition capability. The specific transcript expression was silenced at least up to 37 days post injection with an average reduction of 100 times in insects injected with dsRNAs targeting ATP synthase {beta} (dsATP) compared with those injected with dsRNAs targeting green fluorescent protein (dsGFP), used as negative controls. Insects injected either with dsATP or dsGFP successfully acquired CYp and FDp during feeding on infected plants. However, the average phytoplasma amount in dsATP insects was significantly lower than that measured in dsGFP specimens, indicating a probable reduction of the pathogen multiplication rate when ATP synthase {beta} was silenced. The role of the insect ATP synthase {beta} during phytoplasma infection process is discussed.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSocial contacts can facilitate the spread of both survival-related information and infectious diseases, but little is known about how these processes combine to shape host and parasite evolution. Here, we use a theoretical model that captures both infection and information transmission processes to investigate how host sociality (contact effort) and parasite virulence (disease-associated mortality rate) (co)evolve. We show that selection for sociality (and in turn, virulence) depends on both the intrinsic costs and benefits of social information and infection as well as their relative prevalence in the population. Specifically, greater sociality and lower virulence evolve when the risk of infection is either low or high and social information is neither very common nor too rare. Lower sociality and higher virulence evolve when the prevalence patterns are reversed. When infection and social information are both at moderate levels in the population, the direction of selection depends on the relative costs and benefits of being infected or informed. We also show that sociality varies inversely with virulence, and that parasites may be unable to prevent runaway selection for higher contact efforts. Together, these findings provide new insights for our understanding of group living and how apparently opposing ecological processes can influence the evolution of sociality and virulence in a range of ways.",

    "abstract": "Some species undergo frequent turnovers of sex-determining locus, rather than having stable diverged sex chromosomes. In such species, how often turnover occurs is a fundamental evolutionary question. We model the process with considering a linked locus under sexually antagonistic selection. The entire process of a turnover may be divided into two phases, which are referred to as the stochastic and deterministic phases. The stochastic phase is when a new sex-determining allele just arises and is still rare and random genetic drift plays an important role. In the deterministic phase, the new allele further increases in frequency by positive selection. The theoretical results currently available are for the deterministic phase, which demonstrated that a turnover of a newly arisen sex determining locus could benefit from selection at a linked locus under sexually antagonistic selection, by assuming that sexually antagonistic selection works in a form of balancing selection. In this work, we provide a comprehensive theoretical description of the entire process from the stochastic phase to the deterministic phase. In addition to balancing selection, we explore several other modes of selection on the linked locus. Our theory allows us make a quantitative argument on the rate of turnover and the effect of the mode of selection at the linked locus. We also performed simulations to explore the pattern of polymorphism around the new sex determining locus. We find that the pattern of polymorphism is informative to infer how selection worked through the turnover process.",

    "abstract": "The tetraploid Avena species in the section Pachycarpa Baum, including A. insularis, A. maroccana, and A. murphyi, are thought to be involved in the evolution of hexaploid oats; however, their genome designations are still being debated. Repetitive DNA sequences play an important role in genome structuring and evolution, so understanding the chromosomal organization and distribution of these sequences in Avena species could provide valuable information concerning genome evolution in this genus. In this study, the chromosomal organizations and distributions of six repetitive DNA sequences (including three SSR motifs (TTC, AAC, CAG), one 5S rRNA gene fragment, and two oat A and C genome specific repeats) were investigated using non-denaturing fluorescence in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) in the three tetraploid species mentioned above and in two hexaploid oat species. Preferential distribution of the SSRs in centromeric regions was seen in the A and D genomes, whereas few signals were detected in the C genomes. Some intergenomic translocations were observed in the tetraploids; such translocations were also detected between the C and D genomes in the hexaploids. These results provide robust evidence for the presence of the D genome in all three tetraploids, strongly suggesting that the genomic constitution of these species is DC and not AC, as had been thought previously.",

    "abstract": "Canine mammary cancer is poorly characterized at the genomic level. Dog really can be an appropriate experimental model for human cancers from the genomic and evolutionary perspective or not? Here, we perform a cross-species cancer genomics analysis, independent evolution of cancer from normal tissues, which provide us an excellent opportunity to address an evolutionary perspective of cancer. As, evolutionary theories are critical for understanding tumorigenesis at the level of species as well as at the level of cells and tissues, for the development of effective therapies. Analysis of canine mammary cancer reveals a diversity of histological types as compare to human breast cancer. Our systematic analysis of 24 canine mammary tumors with whole-genome sequences, reveals 185 protein-coding cancer genes carried exonic mutations. Cross-species comparative analysis of 1080 human breast cancers identifies higher median mutation frequency in human breast cancer and canine mammary cancer shows lower across exonic regions (2.67 and 0.187 average no. of mutations per tumor per megabase (Mb), respectively). A comparison of somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene, reveals common recurrence of the conserved mutations, in both species. However, the Ka/Ks ratio in the human PIK3CA gene 2.37 is higher and 1.43 in dogs is lower. To address the mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy theory, we investigated Ka/Ks value 237 aging-related genes from human and canine, the aging-related genes do not show selection in canine mammary cancer. It demonstrates new aspects of cancer genes that are evolving in different species instantaneously. These findings may suggest, the same organs in different mammals impose different selective pressures on the same set of genes in cancer. In both species, some genes may experience strong selective pressures, but do not converge genetically or the conserved genes do not show the same selection pressure in both species. However, human breast cancer shows transcriptomic similarity with canine mammary carcinoma but the other subtypes are quite different. We found canine mammary tumor can be used as a model for inter and intra-tumor heterogeneity. These findings provided insight into mammary cancer across species and possessed potential clinical significance. Collectively, these studies suggest a convergence of some genetic changes in mammary cancer between species but also distinctly different paths to tumorigenesis.",

Biological scaffolds provide a tissue substitute to help facilitate wound healing by mimicking the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the dermis. In the current study an electrospun biomimetic scaffold, wound healing device (WHD), containing tropoelastin (TE) and collagen was synthesized to mimic the biochemical and mechanical characteristics of healthy human skin. The WHD was compared to a commercially available porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) matrix that has been used in both partial and full-thickness wounds, Oasis(R) Wound Matrix. Wound closure rates, histochemistry, qPCR, and mechanical testing of treated wound sites were evaluated. The WHD in a splinted, full-thickness, diabetic murine wound healing model demonstrated an enhanced rate of wound closure, decreased tissue inflammation, skin organ regeneration, and a stronger and more durable remodeled tissue that more closely mimics native unwounded skin compared to the control device.",

    "abstract": "There are currently 85,000 chemicals registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Toxic Substances Control Act, but only a small fraction have measured toxicological data. To address this gap, high-throughput screening (HTS) methods are vital. As part of one such HTS effort, embryonic zebrafish were used to examine a suite of morphological and mortality endpoints at six concentrations from over 1,000 unique chemicals found in the ToxCast library (phase 1 and 2). We hypothesized that by using a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and leveraging this large set of toxicity data, plus chemical structure information, we could efficiently predict toxic outcomes of untested chemicals. CAS numbers for each chemical were used to generate textual files containing three-dimensional structural information for each chemical. Utilizing a novel method in this space, we converted the 3D structural information into a weighted set of points while retaining all information about the structure. In vivo toxicity and chemical data were used to train two neural network generators. The first used regression (Go-ZT) while the second utilized cGAN architecture (GAN-ZT) to train a generator to produce toxicity data. Our results showed that both Go-ZT and GAN-ZT models produce similar results, but the cGAN achieved a higher sensitivity (SE) value of 85.7% vs 71.4%. Conversely, Go-ZT attained higher specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), and Kappa results of 67.3%, 23.4%, and 0.21 compared to 24.5%, 14.0%, and 0.03 for the cGAN, respectively. By combining both Go-ZT and GAN-ZT, our consensus model improved the SP, PPV, and Kappa, to 75.5%, 25.0%, and 0.211, respectively, resulting in an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.663. Considering their potential use as prescreening tools, these models could provide in vivo toxicity predictions and insight into untested areas of the chemical space to prioritize compounds for HT testing.\n\nSummaryA conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) can leverage a large chemical set of experimental toxicity data plus chemical structure information to predict the toxicity of untested compounds.",

This study aims to find out key regulatory genes and their impact on the progression of the disease helping the etiology of the disease which is still largely unknown. We leverage the landmark advantages of time-series gene expression data of this disease, and thereby the identified key regulators capture the characteristics of gene activity patterns in the progression of the cancer. We have identified the key modules and predicted gene functions of top genes from the compiled gene association network (GAN). Here, we have used the natural cubic spline regression model (splineTimeR) to identify differentially expressed genes (DEG) from the PDAC microarray time-series data downloaded from gene expression omnibus (GEO). First, we have identified key transcriptomic regulators (TR) and DNA binding transcription factors (DbTF). Subsequently, the Dirichlet process and Gaussian process (DPGP) mixture model is utilized to identify the key gene modules. A variation of the partial correlation method is utilized to analyze GAN, which is followed by a process of gene function prediction from the network. Finally, a panel of key genes related to PDAC is highlighted from each of the analyses performed.\n\nPlease note: Abbreviations should be introduced at the first mention in the main text - no abbreviations lists.

    "abstract": "The desire to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of resting-state (rs-fMRI) measures has prompted substantial recent research into removing noise components. Chief among contributions to noise in rs-fMRI are physiological processes, and the neuronal implications of respiratory-volume variability (RVT), a main rs-fMRI-relevant physiological process, is incompletely understood. The potential implications of RVT in modulating and being modulated by autonomic nervous regulation, has yet to be fully understood by the rs-fMRI community. In this work, we use high-density electroencephalography (EEG) along with simultaneously acquired RVT recordings to help address this question. We hypothesize that (1) there is a significant relationship between EEG and RVT in multiple EEG bands, and (2) that this relationship varies by brain region. Our results confirm our first hypothesis, although all brain regions are shown to be equally implicated in RVT-related EEG-signal fluctuations. The lag between RVT and EEG is consistent with previously reported values. However, an interesting finding is related to the polarity of the correlation between RVT and EEG. Our results reveal potentially two main regimes of EEG-RVT association, one in which EEG leads RVT with a positive association between the two, and one in which RVT leads EEG but with a positive association between the two. We propose that these two patterns can be interpreted differently in terms of the involvement of higher cognition. These results further suggest that treating RVT simply as noise is likely a questionable practice, and that more work is needed to avoid discarding cognitively relevant information when performing physiological correction rs-fMRI.",

    "abstract": "The cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, SERCA, sequesters calcium in the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER) and plays a critical role in the contraction-relaxation cycle of the heart. A well-known regulator of SERCA in cardiac muscle is phospholamban (PLN), which interacts with the pump and reduces its apparent calcium affinity. A newly discovered SERCA regulatory subunit in cardiac muscle, dwarf open reading frame (DWORF), has added a new level of SERCA regulation. In this report, we modeled the structure of DWORF and evaluated it using molecular dynamics simulations. DWORF structure was modeled as a discontinuous helix with an unwound region at Pro15. This model orients an N-terminal amphipathic helix along the membrane surface and leaves a relatively short C-terminal transmembrane helix. We determined the functional regulation of SERCA by DWORF using a membrane reconstitution system. Surprisingly, we observed that DWORF directly activated SERCA by increasing its turnover rate. Furthermore, in-cell imaging of calcium dynamics demonstrated that DWORF increased SERCA-dependent ER calcium load, calcium reuptake rate, and spontaneous calcium release. Together, these functional assays suggest opposing effects of DWORF and PLN on SERCA function. The results agree with fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments, which revealed changes in the affinity of DWORF for SERCA at low versus high cytosolic calcium concentrations. We found that DWORF has a higher affinity for SERCA in the presence of calcium, while PLN had the opposite behavior, a higher affinity for SERCA in low calcium. We propose a new mechanism for DWORF regulation of cardiac calcium handling in which DWORF directly enhances SERCA turnover by stabilizing the conformations of SERCA that predominate during elevated cytosolic calcium.",

The meadow jumping mouse, a small North American hibernator, exhibits traits - including a short generation time - that would facilitate genetic approaches to hibernation research. Here we report the collection, captive breeding, and laboratory hibernation of meadow jumping mice. Captive breeders in our colony produced a statistically significant excess of male offspring and a large number of all-male and all-female litters. We confirmed that short photoperiod induced pre-hibernation fattening, and cold ambient temperature facilitated entry into hibernation. During pre-hibernation fattening, food consumption exhibited non-linear dependence on both body mass and temperature, such that food consumption was greatest in the heaviest animals at the coldest temperatures. Meadow jumping mice exhibited a strong circadian rhythm of nightly activity that was disrupted during the hibernation interval. We quantified the length and timing of torpor bouts and arousals obtained from an uninterrupted recording of a hibernating female. Over a 90.6 day hibernation interval, torpor bouts ranged from 2.1 to 12.8 days (mean 7.7 days), and arousal length was relatively constant with a mean length of 9.6 hours. We conclude that it is possible to study hibernation phenotypes using captive-bred meadow jumping mice in a laboratory setting.",

    "abstract": "Time-lapse imaging of bacteria growing in micro-channels in a controlled environment has been instrumental in studying the single cell dynamics of bacterial growth. This kind of a microfluidic setup with growth chambers is popularly known as mother machine [1]. In a typical experiment with such a set-up, bacterial growth can be studied for numerous generations with high resolution and temporal precision using image processing. However, as in any other experiment involving imaging, the image data from a typical mother machine experiment has considerable intensity fluctuations, cell intrusion, cell overlapping, filamentation etc. The large amount of data produced in such experiments makes it hard for manual analysis and correction of such unwanted aberrations. We have developed a modular code for segmentation and analysis of mother machine data (SAM) for rod shaped bacteria where we can detect such aberrations and correctly treat them without manual supervision. We track cumulative cell size and use an adaptive segmentation method to avoid faulty detection of cell division. SAM is currently written and compiled using MATLAB. It is fast ([~] 15 min/GB of image) and can be efficiently coupled with shell scripting to process large amount of data with systematic creation of output file structures and graphical results. It has been tested for many different experimental data and is publicly available in Github.",

    "abstract": "Natural language contains information at multiple timescales. To understand how the human brain represents this information, one approach is to build encoding models that predict fMRI responses to natural language using representations extracted from neural network language models (LMs). However, these LM-derived representations do not explicitly separate information at different timescales, making it difficult to interpret the encoding models. In this work we construct interpretable multi-timescale representations by forcing individual units in an LSTM LM to integrate information over specific temporal scales. This allows us to explicitly and directly map the timescale of information encoded by each individual fMRI voxel. Further, the standard fMRI encoding procedure does not account for varying temporal properties in the encoding features. We modify the procedure so that it can capture both short- and long-timescale information. This approach outperforms other encoding models, particularly for voxels that represent long-timescale information. It also provides a finer-grained map of timescale information in the human language pathway. This serves as a framework for future work investigating temporal hierarchies across artificial and biological language systems.",

    "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder vulnerable individuals can develop following a traumatic event, whereas others are resilient. Enhanced insight into the mechanistic underpinnings contributing to these inter-individual differences in PTSD susceptibility is key to improved treatment and prevention. Aberrant function of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) may contribute to its psychopathology, with the dorsal DG potentially encoding trauma memory generalization and the ventral DG anxiety. Using a mouse model, we investigated the association between deviant DG structure and function and susceptibility to develop PTSD-like symptoms following trauma. Mice were exposed to a traumatic event (unpredictable, inescapable foot shocks) and tested for PTSD symptomatology following recovery. In three independent experiments, DG neuronal morphology, synaptic protein gene expression and neuronal activity during trauma encoding and recall were assessed. Behaviorally, PTSD-like animals displayed some increased anxiety-like behavior already prior to trauma, increased novelty-induced freezing, but no clear differences in remote trauma memory recall. Comparison of the ventral DG of PTSD-like vs resilient mice revealed lower spine density, reduced expression of the postsynaptic protein homer 1b/c gene, a larger population of neurons active during trauma encoding and a greater presence of somatostatin neurons to be associated with PTSD susceptibility. In contrast, the dorsal DG of PTSD-like animals did not differ in terms of spine density or gene expression, but displayed more active neurons during trauma encoding and a lower amount of somatostatin neurons. These data propose a critical role for -mainly the ventral-DG in establishing symptomatology addressed in this PTSD model.",

    "abstract": "An essential step toward understanding brain function is to establish a cellular-resolution structural framework upon which multi-scale and multi-modal information spanning molecules, cells, circuits and systems can be integrated and interpreted. Here, through a collaborative effort from the Brain Initiative Cell Census Network (BICCN), we derive a comprehensive cell type-based description of one brain structure - the primary motor cortex upper limb area (MOp-ul) of the mouse. Applying state-of-the-art labeling, imaging, computational, and neuroinformatics tools, we delineated the MOp-ul within the Mouse Brain 3D Common Coordinate Framework (CCF). We defined over two dozen MOp-ul projection neuron (PN) types by their anterograde targets; the spatial distribution of their somata defines 11 cortical sublayers, a significant refinement of the classic notion of cortical laminar organization. We further combine multiple complementary tracing methods (classic tract tracing, cell type-based anterograde, retrograde, and transsynaptic viral tracing, high-throughput BARseq, and complete single cell reconstruction) to systematically chart cell type-based MOp input-output streams. As PNs link distant brain regions at synapses as well as host cellular gene expression, our construction of a PN type resolution MOp-ul wiring diagram will facilitate an integrated analysis of motor control circuitry across the molecular, cellular, and systems levels. This work further provides a roadmap towards a cellular resolution description of mammalian brain architecture.",

PSD-932 and PSD-95, two paralogs of the DLG-MAGUK protein family of signaling scaffolds govern the synaptic incorporation and stabilization of AMPA receptors opposingly, with PSD-95 promoting and PSD-932 inhibiting it. The associated signaling mechanisms that control the synaptic incorporation and stabilization remain elusive. Here, we used domain swapping between the antagonizing signaling scaffolds to identify the protein motifs responsible for enhancing synaptic AMPA receptors and the associated signaling protein. We narrowed down multiple motifs in the N-terminal domain that are principally responsible for governing the enhancement by Src.

    "abstract": "To navigate the social world, humans must represent social entities, and the relationships between those entities, starting with spatial relationships. Recent research suggests that two bodies are processed with particularly high efficiency in visual perception, when they are in a spatial positioning that cues interaction, i.e. close and face-to-face. Socially relevant spatial relations such as facingness may facilitate visual perception by triggering grouping of bodies into a new integrated percept, which would make the stimuli more visible and easier to process. We used electroencephalography and a frequency-tagging paradigm to measure a neural correlate of grouping (or visual binding), while female and male participants saw images of two bodies face-to-face or back-to-back. The two bodies in a dyad flickered at frequency F1 and F2, respectively, and appeared together at a third frequency Fd (dyad frequency). This stimulation should elicit a periodic neural response for each body at F1 and F2, and a third response at Fd, which would be larger for face-to-face (vs. back-to-back) bodies, if those stimuli yield additional integrative processing. Results showed that responses at F1 and F2 were higher for upright than for inverted bodies, demonstrating that our paradigm could capture neural activity associated with viewing bodies. Crucially, the response to dyads at Fd was larger for face-to-face (vs. back-to-back) dyads, suggesting integration mediated by grouping. We propose that spatial relations that recur in social interaction (i.e., facingness) promote binding of multiple bodies into a new representation. This mechanism can explain how the visual system contributes to integrating and transforming the representation of disconnected body-shapes into structured representations of social events.",

In this inflamed tissue microenvironment these monocytes differentiate into an alveolar-like macrophage (AM) phenotype, expressing both Siglec-F and CD11c, surround invading parasitic larvae and preferentially kill parasites in vitro. Monocyte-derived AMs (Mo-AMs) express type 2-associated markers and show distinct remodeling of the chromatin landscape relative to tissue-derived AMs. In particular, they express high amounts of Arg1 (arginase-1), which we demonstrate mediates helminth killing through L-arginine depletion.

We demonstrate this technique on reorienting single-molecules and using binding-activated localization microscopy on DNA intercalators, corroborating perpendicular azimuthal angles to the DNA axis for in-plane emitters but find a non-uniform distribution as a function of the polar angle. The Vortex PSF is realized by an affordable glass phase mask and has a compact footprint that can easily be combined with localization microscopy techniques on rotationally constrained emitters.",

    "abstract": "Luciferases are widely used as reporters for gene expression and for sensitive detection systems. While luciferases from firefly and Renilla have long been used for analysis of intracellular expression, the luciferase (GLuc) from the marine copepod Gaussia princeps, has gained popularity, primarily because it is secreted and displays a very high light intensity. Firefly luciferase is characterized by kinetic behavior which is consistent with conventional steady-state Michaelis-Menten kinetics (termed \"glow\" kinetics). GLuc, conversely, displays what has been termed \"flash\" kinetics which signify a burst in light emission followed by a rapid decay. As the mechanistic background for this behavior is poorly characterized, we decided to decipher the mechanism in more detail. We show that decay in light signal is not due to depletion of substrate, but rather is caused by the irreversible inactivation of the enzyme. Inactivation takes place after between 10 and 200 reaction cycles, depending on substrate concentration. We found that the rate of inactivation is described by the sum of two exponentials with associated rate constants. The dominant of these of these increases linearly with substrate concentration while the minor is substrate-concentration independent. In terms of rate of initial luminescence reaction, this increases with the substrate concentration to the power of 1.53 and shows no signs of saturation up to 10 M coelenterazine. Finally, we found that the inactivated form of the enzyme has a larger apparent size in both size exclusion chromatography and SDS-PAGE analysis and shows a fluorescence peak at 410 nm when excited at 333 nm. These findings indicate that the \"flash\" kinetics in Gaussia luciferase are caused by an irreversible covalent binding to a derivative of the substrate during the reaction.",

    "abstract": "Background and aimsConnections between the gut microbiome and retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) are recently being established. Communication between the gut microbiome and retina, referred to as the gut-retina axis, has been proposed; however, the biologic pathways and mediators involved in the interactions have not yet been elucidated. Using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of whole retinas, we compare the retinal transcriptome from germ-free (GF) and specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice to investigate the effects of the gut-microbiome on both retinal gene expression and biologic pathways.\n\nMethodsRNA was extracted from whole retinas of GF and SPF mice (four animals per group) and cDNA libraries were created. RNA-seq was performed on NovaSEQ6000 using the paired-end method. After preprocessing the RNA-seq data, gene expression value was calculated by count per million (CPM). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with the limma package from Bioconductor on the expression data. Functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction STRING protein-protein association network analyses were created for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs).\n\nResultsRNA-sequencing reveals a cohort of 396 DEGs, of which, 173 are upregulated and 223 are downregulated in GF mouse retina. Enrichment analysis reveals that the DEGs are involved in glucocorticoid effects, transcription factor binding, cytoskeletal stability, lipid metabolism, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Multiple biologic pathways, including obesity/metabolic syndrome, longevity, insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling pathway, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1 transcription pathway, and 5 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway are affected in the GF retinas. PPARG1a (PGC1a) gene is involved in 13 of the 35 significantly modulated pathways. Proteins with the greatest number of interactions in the PPI are E1A binding protein P300(EP300), forkhead box O3(FOXO3), and PGC1a.\n\nConclusionsTo our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the involvement of the gut microbiome in driving the retinal transcriptome, providing evidence for the presence of a gut-retina axis. Future studies are needed to define the precise role of the gut-retina axis in the pathogenesis of retinal diseases.",

    "abstract": "The role of Transposable Elements (TEs) in regulating diverse biological processes, from early development to cancer, is becoming increasing appreciated. However, unlike other biological processes, next generation single-cell sequencing technologies are ill-suited for assaying TE expression: in particular, their highly repetitive nature means that short cDNA reads cannot be unambiguously mapped to a specific locus. Consequently, it is extremely challenging to understand the mechanisms by which TE expression is regulated and how they might themselves regulate other protein coding genes. To resolve this, we introduce CELLO-seq, a novel method and computational framework for performing long-read RNA sequencing at single cell resolution. CELLO-seq allows for full-length RNA sequencing and enables measurement of allelic, isoform and TE expression at unique loci. We use CELLO-seq to assess the widespread expression of TEs in 2-cell mouse blastomeres as well as human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). Across both species, old and young TEs showed evidence of locus-specific expression, with simulations demonstrating that only a small number of very young elements in the mouse could not be mapped back to with high confidence. Exploring the relationship between the expression of individual elements and putative regulators revealed surprising heterogeneity, with TEs within a class showing different patterns of correlation, suggesting distinct regulatory mechanisms.",

Candidates included cytoskeletal regulators, cytosolic protein transporters, exocytosis and endocytosis regulators, and proteins necessary for synaptic regulation. A subset of high priority candidates was validated, including Myo16, Coro1A, SNAP47, ExoC1, GRIP1, PRG-1, and KIF1A. For a subset of validated candidates, we utilized TIRF microscopy to demonstrate dynamic colocalization with TRIM proteins at the axonal periphery, including at the tips of filopodia. Further analysis demonstrated the RNAi-based knockdown of the unconventional myosin Myo16 in cortical neurons altered axonal branching patterns in a TRIM9 and netrin-1 dependent manner. Future analysis of other validated candidates will likely identify novel proteins and mechanisms by which TRIM9 and TRIM67 regulate neuronal form and function.",

    "abstract": "O_LIImage data is one of the primary sources of ecological data used in biodiversity conservation and management worldwide. However, classifying and interpreting large numbers of images is time and resource expensive, particularly in the context of camera trapping. Deep learning models have been used to achieve this task but are often not suited to specific applications due to their inability to generalise to new environments and inconsistent performance. Models need to be developed for specific species cohorts and environments, but the technical skills required to achieve this are a key barrier to the accessibility of this technology to ecologists. There is a strong need to democratise access to deep learning technologies by providing an easy to use software application allowing non-technical users to custom train custom object detectors.\nC_LIO_LIU-Infuse addresses this issue by putting the power of AI into the hands of ecologists. U-Infuse provides ecologists with the ability to train customised models using publicly available images and/or their own camera trap images, without the constraints of annotating and pre-processing large numbers of images, or specific technical expertise. U-Infuse is a free and open-source software solution that supports both multiclass and single class training and inference, allowing ecologists to access state of the art AI on their own device, customised to their application without sharing IP or sensitive data.\nC_LIO_LIU-Infuse provides ecological practitioners with the ability to (i) easily achieve camera trap object detection within a user-friendly GUI, generating a species distribution report, and other useful statistics, (ii) custom train deep learning models using publicly available and custom training data, (iii) achieve supervised auto-annotation of images for further training, with the benefit of editing annotations to ensure quality datasets.\nC_LIO_LIBroad adoption of U-Infuse by ecological practitioners will improve camera trap image analysis and processing by allowing significantly more image data to be processed with minimal expenditure of time and resources. Ease of training and reliance on transfer learning means domain-specific models can be trained rapidly, and frequently updated without the need for computer science expertise, or data sharing, protecting intellectual property and privacy.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCancer genomic studies often include data collected from several omics platforms. Each omics data source contributes to the understanding of the underlying biological process via source specific (\"individual\") patterns of variability. At the same time, statistical associations and potential interactions among the different data sources can reveal signals from common biological processes that might not be identified by single source analyses. These common patterns of variability are referred to as \"shared\" or \"joint\". In this work, we show how the use of joint and individual components can lead to better predictive models, and to a deeper understanding of the biological process at hand. We identify joint and individual contributions of DNA methylation, miRNA and mRNA expression collected from blood samples in a lung cancer case-control study nested within the Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) cohort study, and we use such components to build prediction models for case-control and metastatic status. To assess the quality of predictions, we compare models based on simultaneous, integrative analysis of multi-source omics data to a standard non-integrative analysis of each single omics dataset, and to penalized regression models. Additionally, we apply the proposed approach to a breast cancer dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas.\n\nResultsOur results show how an integrative analysis that preserves both components of variation is more appropriate than standard multi-omics analyses that are not based on such a distinction. Both joint and individual components are shown to contribute to a better quality of model predictions, and facilitate the interpretation of the underlying biological processes in lung cancer development.\n\nConclusionIn the presence of multiple omics data sources, we recommend the use of data integration techniques that preserve the joint and individual components across the omics sources. We show how the inclusion of such components increases the quality of model predictions of clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Population-scale genetic studies can identify drug targets and allow disease risk to be predicted with resulting benefit for management of individual health risks and system-wide allocation of health care delivery resources. Although population-scale projects are underway in many parts of the world, genetic variation between population groups means that additional projects are warranted. South Asia has a population whose genetics is the least characterized of any of the worlds major populations. Here we describe GenomeAsia studies that characterize population structure in South Asia and that create tools for economical and accurate genotyping at population-scale. Prior work on population structure characterized isolated population groups, the relevance of which to large-scale studies of disease genetics is unclear. For our studies we used whole genome sequence information from 4,807 individuals recruited in the health care delivery systems of Pakistan, India and Bangladesh to ensure relevance to population-scale studies of disease genetics. We combined this with WGS data from 927 individuals from isolated South Asian population groups, and developed a custom SNP array (called SARGAM) that is optimized for future human genetic studies in South Asia. We find evidence for high rates of reproductive isolation, endogamy and consanguinity that vary across the subcontinent and that lead to levels of homozygosity that approach 100 times that seen in outbred populations. We describe founder effects that increase the power to associate functional variants with disease processes and that make South Asia a uniquely powerful place for population-scale genetic studies.",

    "abstract": "Direct comparison of bulk gene expression profiles is complicated by distinct cell type mixtures in each sample which obscure whether observed differences are actually due to changes in expression levels themselves or simply due to differing cell type compositions. Single-cell technology has made it possible to measure gene expression in individual cells, achieving higher resolution at the expense of increased noise. If carefully incorporated, such single-cell data can be used to deconvolve bulk samples to yield accurate estimates of the true cell type proportions, thus enabling one to disentangle the effects of differential expression and cell type mixtures. Here, we propose a generative model and a likelihood-based inference method that uses asymptotic statistical theory and a novel optimization procedure to perform deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data to produce accurate cell type proportion estimates. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, called RNA-Sieve, across a diverse array of scenarios involving real data and discuss extensions made uniquely possible by our probabilistic framework, including a demonstration of well-calibrated confidence intervals.",

    "abstract": "Systemic antibody light chains (AL) amyloidosis is characterized by deposition of amyloid fibrils derived from a particular antibody light chain. Cardiac involvement is a major risk factor for mortality. Using MAS solid-state NMR, we study the fibril structure of a recombinant light chain fragment corresponding to the fibril protein from patient FOR005, together with fibrils formed by protein sequence variants that reflect the closest germline (GL) sequence. Both analyzed fibril structures were seeded with ex-vivo amyloid fibrils purified from the explanted heart of this patient. We find that residues 11-42 and 69-102 adopt {beta}-sheet conformation in patient protein fibrils. We identify glycine-49 that is mutated with respect to the germline sequence into arginine-49 as a key residue that forms a salt bridge to aspartate-25 in the patient protein fibril structure. Fibrils from the GL protein and from the patient protein harboring the single point mutation R49G can be both heterologously seeded using patient ex-vivo fibrils. Seeded R49G fibrils show an increased heterogeneity for the C-terminal residues 80-102 which is reflected by the disappearance of all resonances of these residues. By contrast, residues 11-42 and 69-77, which are visible in the MAS solid-state NMR spectra show 13C chemical shifts that are highly similar to patient fibrils. The mutation R49G thus induces a conformational heterogeneity at the C-terminus in the fibril state, while the overall fibril topology is retained.",

    "abstract": "The rostrocaudal patterning of the neural tube is a key event in early brain development. This process is mainly driven by a gradient of WNT, which defines the fate of the present neural progenitor cells in a dose dependent matter and leads to a subdivision of the tube into forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Although this process is extensively studied experimentally both in vivo and in vitro, an integrated view of the responsible genetic circuitry is currently lacking. In this work, we present a minimal gene regulatory model for rostrocaudal neural tube patterning. The model's nodes and architecture are determined in a data driven way, leading to a tristable configuration of mutually repressing brain regions. Analysis of the parameter sensitivity and simulations of knockdown and overexpression cases show that repression of hindbrain fate is a promising strategy for the improvement of current protocols for the generation of dopaminergic neurons in vitro. Furthermore, we combine the model with an existing model for dorsoventral neural tube patterning, to test its capabilities in an in vivo setting, by predicting the steady state pattern of a realistic three-dimensional neural tube. This reveals that the rostrocaudal pattern stacks dorsoventrally in the caudal half of the neural tube. Finally, we simulate morphogen secretion overexpression, which highlights the sensitivity of neural tube patterning to the morphogen levels.",
