    "abstract": "Ectopic adenosine triphosphate (eATP) synthase, located on the cell surface instead of the mitochondrial inner membrane, has been discovered to be a novel target for the treatment of various types of cancer. However, the mechanism of eATP synthase trafficking toward the cell surface remains unclear. In this study, we used an integrative approach incorporating multiomics, super-resolution imaging, real-time live-cell tracing, and various functional analyses to derive a transport model of eATP synthase from the mitochondria to the plasma membrane in cancer cells. We determined that the ATP synthase complex is first assembled in the mitochondria and subsequently delivered to the cell surface through the microtubule-mediated mitochondrial transport pathway. We also found that dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) enhances mitochondrial fission and subsequently associates with microtubule motor protein kinesin family member 5B (KIF5B) to promote the subcellular transportation of eATP synthase. Consequently, our work provides a blueprint for eATP synthase trafficking from the mitochondria toward the cell surface.",

    "abstract": "Global concern around substantial losses of biodiversity has led to the development of a number of large-scale long-term monitoring programs. In the past few decades, networks were established to obtain appropriate data on the spatial and temporal variation of marine species on rocky shores. Recently, the Marine Biodiversity Observation Network Pole to Pole of the Americas program (MBON P2P) was established and is coordinating biodiversity surveys along coastal areas throughout the continent. In this context, the goal of this paper was to demonstrate whether the proposed MBON P2P sampling protocol is capable of detecting rapid declines in cover of foundation species on Patagonian rocky shores. Changes in mussel beds cover were studied on monitored sites in northern Patagonia. Concurrently, long-term mussel bed dynamics were assessed based on existing data. Results showed that a mussel mortality event could be detected with this methodology. It took less than a year for mussel cover to drop from 90 to almost 0% despite the fact that significant changes in mussel bed cover were not registered in the previous 20 years at the study area. Therefore, yearly monitoring is needed, as a minimum, in order to timely perceive this kind of process. Real-time detection offers the opportunity of properly understanding the causes that lead to the loss of key community components such as these foundation species. Furthermore, it would provide early warning to decision makers enhancing the chances of conservation of natural environments and their key ecosystem services.",

    "abstract": "Several theoretical models suggest that deciding about actions and executing them are not completely distinct neural mechanisms but instead two modes of an integrated dynamical system. Here, we investigate this proposal by examining how neural activity unfolds during a dynamic decision-making task within the high-dimensional space defined by the activity of cells in monkey dorsal premotor (PMd), primary motor (M1), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) as well as the external and internal segments of the globus pallidus (GPe, GPi). Dimensionality reduction shows that the four strongest components of neural activity are functionally interpretable, reflecting a state transition between deliberation and commitment, the transformation of sensory evidence into a choice, and the baseline and slope of the rising urgency to decide. Analysis of the contribution of each population to these components shows differences between regions but no distinct clusters within each region. During deliberation, cortical activity unfolds on a two-dimensional \"decision manifold\" defined by sensory evidence and urgency, and falls off this manifold at the moment of commitment into a choice-dependent trajectory leading to movement initiation. The structure of the manifold varies between regions: In PMd it is curved, in M1 it is nearly perfectly flat, and in dlPFC it is almost entirely confined to the sensory evidence dimension. In contrast, pallidal activity during deliberation is primarily defined by urgency. We suggest that these findings reveal the distinct dynamics of different regions, supporting a unified recurrent attractor model of action selection and execution.",

    "abstract": "Meditation practice entails moments of distraction dominated by self-generated thoughts (i.e. mind wandering). Initial studies assessing the neural correlates of mind wandering in the context of meditation practice have identified an important role of theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-14 Hz) neural oscillations. In this study, we use a probe-caught experience sampling paradigm to assess spectral changes in the theta-alpha frequency range during mind wandering in the context of breath focus meditation. Electroencephalography (EEG) was measured in 25 novice meditation practitioners during a breath focus task in which they were repeatedly probed to report whether they were focusing on their breath or thinking about something else. Mind wandering episodes were associated with an increase in the amplitude and a decrease in the frequency of theta (4-8 Hz) oscillations. Conversely, alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz) were shown to decrease in amplitude and increase in frequency during mind wandering relative to breath focus. In addition, mind wandering episodes were shown to be accompanied by increased harmonicity and phase synchrony between alpha and theta rhythms. Because similar spectral changes in the theta-alpha frequency range have been reported during controlled cognitive processes involving memory and executive control, we speculate that mind wandering and controlled processes could share some neurocognitive mechanisms. From a translational perspective, this study indicates that oscillatory activity in the theta-alpha frequency range could form adequate parameters for developing EEG-neurofeedback protocols aimed at facilitating the detection of mind wandering during meditation practice.",

We differentiated astrocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells of monozygotic twins discordant for SCZ, and found sex-specific gene expression and signaling pathway alterations related particularly to inflammation and synaptic functions. While Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified SCZ disease and synaptic transmission pathway changes in SCZ astrocytes, the most consistent findings were related to collagen and cell adhesion associated pathways. Neuronal responses to glutamate and GABA differed between astrocytes from control persons, affected twins, and their unaffected co-twins, and were normalized by clozapine treatment. SCZ astrocyte cell transplantation to the mouse forebrain caused gene expression changes in demyelination, synaptic dysfunction and inflammation pathways of mouse brain cells and resulted in behavioral changes in cognitive and olfactory functions. Altogether, our results show that astrocytes contribute to both familial risk and clinical manifestation of SCZ in a sex-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Entrainment of brain oscillations can be achieved using rhythmic non-invasive brain stimulation, and stimulation of the motor cortex at a frequency associated with sensorimotor inhibition can impair motor responses. Despite the potential for therapeutic application, these techniques do not lend themselves to use outside of a clinical setting. Here, the aim was to investigate whether rhythmic median nerve stimulation (MNS) could be used to entrain oscillations related to sensorimotor inhibition. MEG data were recorded from 20 participants during 400 trials, where for each trial 10 pulses of MNS were delivered either rhythmically or arrhythmically at 12 or 20Hz. Our results demonstrate a frequency specific increase in relative amplitude in the contralateral somatosensory cortex during rhythmic but not arrhythmic stimulation. This was coupled with an increase in inter-trial phase coherence at the same frequency, suggesting that the oscillations synchronised with the pulses of MNS. While the results show that 20Hz rhythmic peripheral nerve stimulation can produce entrainment, the response to 12Hz stimulation was largely due to the presence of rhythmic sensory evoked potentials. Regardless, rhythmic MNS resulted in synchronous firing of neuronal populations within the contralateral somatosensory cortex meaning these neurons were  occupied in processing of the afferent input. Therefore, MNS could prove therapeutically useful in disorders associated with hyperexcitability within the sensorimotor cortices.",

    "abstract": "The brain is thought to represent information in the form of activity in distributed groups of neurons known as attractors, but it is not clear how attractors are formed or used in processing. We show here that in a randomly connected network of simulated spiking neurons, periodic stimulation of neurons with distributed phase offsets, along with standard spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP), efficiently creates distributed attractors. These attractors may have a consistent ordered firing pattern, or become disordered, depending on the conditions. We also show that when two such attractors are stimulated in sequence, the same STDP mechanism can create a directed association between them, forming the basis of an associative network. We find that for an STDP time constant of 20ms, the dependence of the efficiency of attractor creation on the driving frequency has a broad peak centered around 8Hz. Upon restimulation, the attractors selfoscillate, but with an oscillation frequency that is higher than the driving frequency, ranging from 10-100Hz.",

    "abstract": "The majority of seizures recorded in humans and experimental animal models can be described by a generic phenomenological mathematical model, The Epileptor. In this model, seizure-like events (SLEs) are driven by a slow variable and occur via saddle node (SN) and homoclinic bifurcations at seizure onset and offset, respectively. Here we investigated SLEs at the single cell level using a biophysically relevant neuron model including a slow/fast system of four equations. The two equations for the slow subsystem describe ion concentration variations and the two equations of the fast subsystem delineate the electrophysiological activities of the neuron. Using extracellular K+ as a slow variable, we report that SLEs with SN/homoclinic bifurcations can readily occur at the single cell level when extracellular K+ reaches a critical value. In patients and experimental models, seizures can also evolve into sustained ictal activity (SIA) and, depolarization block (DB), activities which are also parts of the dynamic repertoire of the Epileptor. Increasing extracellular concentration of K+ in the model to values found during experimental status epilepticus and DB, we show that SIA and DB can also occur at the single cell level. Thus, seizures, SIA and DB, which have been first identified as network events, can exist in a unified framework of a biophysical model at the single neuron level and exhibit similar dynamics as observed in the Epileptor.\n\nAuthor SummaryEpilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of seizures. Seizures have been characterized in patients in experimental models at both macroscopic and microscopic scales using electrophysiological recordings. Experimental works allowed the establishment of a detailed taxonomy of seizures, which can be described by mathematical models. We can distinguish two main types of models. Phenomenological (generic) models have few parameters and variables and permit detailed dynamical studies often capturing a majority of activities observed in experimental conditions. But they also have abstract parameters, making biological interpretation difficult. Biophysical models, on the other hand, use a large number of variables and parameters due to the complexity of the biological systems they represent. Because of the multiplicity of solutions, it is difficult to extract general dynamical rules. In the present work, we integrate both approaches and reduce a detailed biophysical model to sufficiently low-dimensional equations, and thus maintaining the advantages of a generic model. We propose, at the single cell level, a unified framework of different pathological activities that are seizures, depolarization block, and sustained ictal activity.",

It is unknown, however, whether and how environmental enrichment alters the morphology and dynamics of individual synapses. Here, we present a virtually crosstalk free, two-color in vivo STED microscope to simultaneously superresolve the dynamics of endogenous PSD95 of the post-synaptic density and spine geometry. With environmental enrichment, the size distributions of PSD95 and spine head sizes were sharper than in controls, indicating that synaptic strength is set more precisely with environmental enrichment. Spine head geometry and PSD95 assemblies were highly dynamic but their changes correlated only mildly. With environmental enrichment, the topography of the PSD95 nanoorganization was more dynamic; changes in size were smaller than in mice housed in standard cages and depended linearly on their original size. Thus, two-color in vivo time-lapse imaging of synaptic nanoorganization uncovers a unique synaptic nanoplasticity associated with the enhanced learning capabilities under environmental enrichment.",

Using brain slice recording and computational modeling of synaptic transmission, we found that substantial glutamate is maintained in the UBC synaptic cleft, sufficient to modify spontaneous firing in OFF UBCs and tonically desensitize AMPARs of ON UBC. The source of ambient glutamate was spontaneous, spike-independent exocytosis from the mossy fiber terminal, and its level was dependent on activity of glutamate transporters EAAT1-2. Changing levels of ambient glutamate shifted the polarity of evoked synaptic responses in ON UBCs and altered the phase of responses to in vivo-like synaptic activity. Unlike classical fast synapses, receptors at the UBC synapse are virtually always exposed to a significant level of glutamate, which varies in a graded manner during transmission.",

Thus, cetacean brains possess multiple characteristics indicative of intensified thermogenetic functionality that can be related to their current and historical obligatory aquatic niche.

Yet, contemporary clustering and dimensionality reduction tools alone are insufficient to analyze or reproduce analyses across large numbers of samples, batches, or experiments. Moreover, approaches that allow for the integration of data across batches or experiments are not well incorporated into computational toolkits to allow for streamlined workflows. Here we present Spectre, an R package that enables comprehensive end-to-end integration and analysis of high-dimensional cytometry data from different batches or experiments. Spectre streamlines the analytical stages of raw data pre-processing, batch alignment, data integration, clustering, dimensionality reduction, visualization and population labelling, as well as quantitative and statistical analysis. Critically, the fundamental data structures used within Spectre, along with the implementation of machine learning classifiers, allow for the scalable analysis of very large high-dimensional datasets, generated by flow cytometry, mass cytometry (CyTOF), or spectral cytometry. Using open and flexible data structures, Spectre can also be used to analyze data generated by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) or high-dimensional imaging technologies, such as Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC). The simple, clear, and modular design of analysis workflows allow these tools to be used by bioinformaticians and laboratory scientists alike. Spectre is available as an R package or Docker container. R code is available on Github (https://github.com/immunedynamics/spectre).",

In this study, we used a new computational tool called Neutralization Map to determine the hemagglutination inhibition profiles of individual antibodies within ferret antisera elicited by repeated influenza A/H3 infections. Our results suggest that repeated infections continuously reshape the ferret antibody repertoire, but that a broadly neutralizing antibody signature can nevertheless be induced irrespective of OAS.

Here we propose an additional explanation for the maintenance of multidrug resistance (MDR) plasmids in clinical Escherichia coli strains. After co-evolving two MDR plasmids encoding last resort carbapenem resistance with an extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli strain, we observed that chromosomal media adaptive mutations in the global regulatory systems CCR (Carbon Catabolite Repression) and ArcAB (Aerobic Respiration Control) pleiotropically mitigated the costs of both plasmids. Mechanistically, cost reductions were due to a net downregulation of plasmid gene expression. Our results suggest that global chromosomal transcriptional re-wiring during bacterial niche-adaptation may facilitate plasmid maintenance.",

Here, by systematically building mutations into the H-glycoprotein of an attenuated measles strain and assaying for serum neutralization, we show that virus evolution is severely constrained by the existence of numerous codominant H-glycoprotein antigenic sites, some critical for binding to pathogenicity receptors SLAMF1 and Nectin-4. We further demonstrate the existence in serum of protective neutralizing antibodies targeting codominant F-glycoprotein epitopes.

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (STM) is an invasive, facultative intracellular pathogen that resides in a specialized membrane-bound compartment termed Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). Essential for survival and proliferation in the SCV is Salmonella pathogenicity island II (SPI2) that encodes a type III secretion system (T3SS). The SPI2-T3SS and the effector translocation maintain SCV integrity and formation of specific tubular membrane compartments, called Salmonella-induced filaments (SIFs). The SCV/SIF continuum allows STM to bypass nutritional restriction in the intracellular environment by acquiring nutrients from the host cell. Phosphate is one of the most abundant elements in living organisms and in STM, inorganic phosphate (Pi) homeostasis is mediated by the two-component regulatory system PhoBR, resulting in expression of the high affinity phosphate transporter pstSCAB-phoU. Using fluorescent protein reporters, we investigate Pi availability for STM at single cell level over time within the intracellular habitats of different host cells. We observed that the pstSCAB-phoU encoded phosphate uptake system is essential for intracellular replication of STM because there is a Pi ion concentration less 10 M within the SCV. Additionally, the demand and consumption of Pi correlates with intracellular proliferation of STM and we identify a dependency of SPI2 activity and Pi starvation.",

    "abstract": "Chinese Marselan grapes are believed to possess the potential to become a characteristic regional variety, whose quality is internationally recognized. The fermentation-related mycobiota from six climatically diverse Marselan-producing regions in China were analyzed via high-throughput sequencing (HTS), while the influence of environmental factors was evaluated as well. The results implied that the phyla Ascomycota and genus Aureobasidium dominated the fungal communities in 166 Marselan must and ferment samples. Significant differences were detected in the fungal microbiota from the regions, as well as the wineries, while these discrepancies decreased as the fermentation progressed. Moreover, the difference in fungal communities between the wineries exceeded the variation involving the regions, and higher diversity was identified in the types of species than in the compositions. Geoclimatic elements (Gc) and physicochemical indexes (Pi) exerted a significant effect on the fungal must consortium, explaining 58.17% of the taxonomic information. Therefore, a correlation was proposed between the spontaneous fermentation performance, as well as the polyphenol (PP) content, and their association with fungal taxonomic composition. In addition to enriching the knowledge regarding the wine microbiome and its influencing factors, this study may provide a new strategy for harnessing autochthonous \"microbial terroir\".\n\nImportanceWine microbiome and their metabolism play a crucial role in wine quality. Chinese wine-producing regions are widely distributed with diverse geoclimatic conditions, this study reports a most comprehensive biogeography of fermentation-related fungal communities performed to date, taking the Chinese promising Marselan grape variety as the research object. It reveals significant differences in the fungal microbiota of Marselan must and ferment from different regions and wineries, and higher otherness between species type than that between species composition. The study also reports the main geoclimatic and physicochemical factors shaping fungal flora. Moreover, a correlation was proposed among the spontaneous fermentation performance with fungal taxonomic composition and polyphenol content. Taken together, the results shed light on the wine fungal communities and its influencing factors, which is crucial for vineyard and fermentation microorganism management, and may also provide a new strategy for harnessing autochthonous \"microbial terroir\" by utilizing spontaneous fermentation.",

    "abstract": "Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli are a major global threat to human health, wherein multi-drug resistance is primarily spread by MDR plasmid acquisition. MDR plasmids are not widely distributed across the entire E. coli species, but instead are concentrated in a small number of clones. Here, we test if diverse E. coli strains vary in their ability to acquire and maintain MDR plasmids, and if this relates to their transcriptional response following plasmid acquisition. We used strains from across the diversity of E. coli, including the common MDR lineage ST131, and the IncF plasmid, pLL35, encoding multiple antibiotic resistance genes. Strains varied in their ability to acquire pLL35 by conjugation, but all were able to stably maintain the plasmid. The effects of pLL35 acquisition on cefotaxime resistance and growth also varied among strains, with growth responses ranging from a small decrease to a small increase in growth of the plasmid-carrier relative to the parental strain. Transcriptional responses to pLL35 acquisition were limited in scale and highly strain specific. We observed significant transcriptional responses at the operon or regulon level, possibly due to stress responses or interactions with resident MGEs. Subtle transcriptional responses consistent across all strains were observed affecting functions, such as anaerobic metabolism, previously shown to be under negative frequency dependent selection in MDR E. coli. Overall, there was no correlation between the magnitude of the transcriptional and growth responses across strains. Together these data suggest that fitness costs arising from transcriptional disruption are unlikely to act as a barrier to dissemination of this MDR plasmid in E. coli.\n\nImportancePlasmids play a key role in bacterial evolution by transferring niche adaptive functions between lineages, including driving the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. Fitness costs of plasmid acquisition arising from the disruption of cellular processes could limit the spread of multidrug resistance plasmids. However, the impacts of plasmid acquisition are typically measured in lab-adapted strains rather than in more ecologically relevant natural isolates. Using a clinical multidrug resistance plasmid and a diverse collection of E. coli strains isolated from clinical infections and natural environments, we show that plasmid acquisition had only limited and highly strain-specific effects on bacterial growth and transcription. These findings suggest that fitness costs arising from transcriptional disruption are unlikely to act as a barrier to transmission of this plasmid in natural populations of E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Colistin is extensively used in animal production in many low- and middle-income countries. There is a need to develop methodologies to benchmark and monitor changes in resistance in commensal bacterial populations in farms. We aimed to evaluate the performance of a broth microdilution method based on culturing a pooled Escherichia coli suspension (30-50 organisms) from each sample. In order to confirm the biological basis and sensitivity of the method, we prepared 16 standard suspensions containing variable ratios of colistin-susceptible and mcr-1 encoded colistin-resistant E. coli which were grown in 2mg/L colistin. The optical density (OD600nm) readings over time were used to generate a growth curve, and were adjusted to the values obtained in the absence of colistin. The median limit of detection of the method was 1 colistin-resistant in 104 susceptible colonies [1st - 3rd quartile, 1:102 - 1:105]. We applied this method to 108 pooled faecal samples from 36 chicken flocks in the Mekong Delta (Vietnam) over the production cycle. The correlation between this method and the prevalence of colistin resistance in individual colonies harvested from field samples, determined by the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), was established. The overall prevalence of colistin resistance at sample and isolate level was 38.9% and 19.4%, respectively. Increased colistin resistance was associated with recent (2 weeks) use of colistin and other, non-colistin antimicrobials (OR=3.67 and OR=1.84, respectively). Our method is a sensitive and affordable approach to monitor changes in colistin resistance in pooled E. coli populations from faecal samples over time.\n\nIMPORTANCEColistin (polymyxin E) is an antimicrobial with poor solubility properties, and therefore broth microdilution is the only appropriate method for testing colistin resistance. However, estimating colistin resistance in commensal mixed Escherichia coli populations is laborious since it requires individual colony isolation, identification and susceptibility testing. We developed a growth-based microdilution method suitable for pooled faecal samples. We validated the method by comparing it with results from individual MIC testing of 909 E. coli isolates. We used the method to investigate phenotypic colistin resistance in 108 pooled faecal samples from 36 healthy chicken flocks, each sampled three times over the production cycle. A higher level of resistance was seen in flocks recently supplemented with colistin in drinking water, although the observed generated resistance was short-lived. Our method is affordable, and may potentially be integrated into surveillance systems aiming at estimating the prevalence of resistance at colony level in flocks/herds. Furthermore, it may also be adapted to other complex biological systems, such as farms and abattoirs.",

To assess the relevance of tolerance and its implications for resistance development, we used in vitro evolution and analyzed inpatient microevolution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important human pathogen causing acute and chronic infections. We show that the development of tolerance precedes and promotes the acquisition of resistance in vitro and we present evidence that similar processes shape antibiotic exposure in human patients. Our data suggest that during chronic infections, P. aeruginosa first acquires moderate drug tolerance before following distinct evolutionary trajectories that lead to high-level multi-drug tolerance or to antibiotic resistance. Our studies propose that the development of antibiotic tolerance predisposes bacteria for the acquisition of resistance at early stages of infection and that both mechanisms independently promote bacterial survival during antibiotic treatment at later stages of chronic infections.",

    "abstract": "Microbial death is extremely common in nature, yet the ecological role of dead bacteria is unclear. Dead cells are assumed to provide nutrients to surrounding microbes, but may also affect them in other ways. We found adding lysate prepared from dead bacteria to cultures of E. coli in nutrient-rich conditions suppressed their final population density. This is in stark contrast with the notion that the primary role of dead cells is nutritional, although we also observed this type of effect when we added dead bacteria to cultures that were not supplied with other nutrients. We only observed the growth-suppressive effect of dead bacteria after they had undergone significant lysis, suggesting a key role for cellular contents released during lysis. Transcriptomic analysis revealed changes in gene expression in response to dead cells in growing populations, particularly in genes involved in motility. This was supported by experiments with genetic knockouts and copy-number manipulation. Because lysis is commonplace in natural and clinical settings, the growth-suppressive effect of dead cells we describe here may be a widespread and previously unrecognized constraint on bacterial population growth.",

    "abstract": "Here a triple functional sensing chip was created for L. monocytogenes detection by integrating three biomarkers (Listeriolysin O (LLO) at protein level, hly gene at genetic level, and acetoin at metabolic level). Liposome encapsulated catechol was used for LLO detection via LLO pore-forming ability. hly gene was specifically captured by using a thiolated capture probe on nanoporous gold (NPG). As an electroactive label, methylene blue was embedded in double-stranded structures to generate an electrochemical signal for hly detection. Combined with the electrocatalysis of NADH by NPG, the acetoin detection was achieved by measuring the consumption of NADH as a cofactor under acetoin reductase catalysis. Importantly, the L. monocytogenes detection results obtained by detecting three biomarkers using the chip can be mutually verified, which reduces the probability of false positives based on a single marker. Moreover, the detection time was reduced to about 90 min, making it a rapid and reliable tool for L. monocytogenes detection.",

    "abstract": "Insight into the establishment and maintenance of HIV-1 infection in resting CD4+ T cell subsets is critical for the development of therapeutics targeting the HIV-1 reservoir. Although the frequency of HIV-1 infection, as quantified by the frequency of HIV-1 DNA, is lower in CD4+ naive T cells (TN) compared to the memory T cell subsets, recent studies have shown that TN cells harbor a large pool of replication-competent virus. Interestingly, however, TN cells are highly resistant to direct (cis) HIV-1 infection in vitro, in particular to R5-tropic HIV-1, as TN cells do not express CCR5. In this study, we investigated whether TN cells could be efficiently HIV-1 trans-infected by professional antigen-presenting B lymphocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (DC) in the absence of global T cell activation. We found that B cells, but not DC, have a unique ability to efficiently trans infect TN cells in vitro. In contrast, both B cells and DC mediated HIV-1 trans infection of memory and activated CD4+ T cells. Moreover, we found that TN isolated from HIV-1-infected nonprogressors (NP) harbor significantly disproportionately lower levels of HIV-1 DNA compared to TN isolated from progressors. This is consistent with our previous finding that APC derived from NP do not efficiently trans-infect CD4+ T cells due to alterations in APC cholesterol metabolism and cell membrane lipid raft organization. These findings support that B cell-mediated trans infection of TN cells with HIV-1 has a more profound role than previously considered in establishing the viral reservoir and control of HIV-1 disease progression.\n\nImportanceThe latent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reservoir in persons on antiretroviral therapy represents a major barrier to a cure. Although most studies have focused on the HIV-1 reservoir in the memory T cell subset, replication competent HIV-1 has been isolated from naive T cells, and CCR5-tropic HIV-1 has been recovered from CCR5negTN cells from ART-suppressed HIV-1-infected individuals. In this study, we showed that CCR5negTN cells are efficiently trans infected with R-5 tropic HIV-1 by B lymphocytes, but not by myeloid dendritic cells. Furthermore, we found that TN isolated from NP harbor no or significantly less copies of HIV-1 DNA compared to ART-suppressed progressors. These findings support that B cell-mediated trans infection of TN cells with HIV-1 has a more profound role than previously considered in establishing the viral reservoir and control of HIV-1 disease progression. Understanding the establishment and maintenance of the HIV-1 latent reservoir is fundamental for the design of effective treatments for viral eradication.",

However, other maternal-effect genes are not accessible due to their essential zygotic functions during embryonic development.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, treatments for bacterial infection have focused on killing the microbe or preventing its growth. As antimicrobial resistance becomes more ubiquitous, the feasibility of this approach is beginning to wane and attention has begun to shift toward disrupting the host-pathogen interaction by improving the host defense. Using a high-throughput, fragment-based screen to identify compounds that alleviate Pseudomonas aeruginosa-mediated killing of Caenorhabditis elegans, we identified over 20 compounds that stimulated host defense gene expression. Five of these molecules were selected for further characterization. Four of five compounds showed little toxicity against mammalian cells or worms, consistent with their identification in a phenotypic, high-content screen. Each of the compounds activated several host defense pathways, but the pathways were generally dispensable for compound-mediated rescue in Liquid Killing, suggesting redundancy or that the activation of one or more unknown pathways may be driving compound effects. A genetic mechanism was identified for LK56, which required the Mediator subunit MDT-15/MED15 and NHR-49/HNF4 for its function. Interestingly, LK32, LK34, LK38, and LK56 also rescue C. elegans from P. aeruginosa in an agar-based assay, which uses different virulence factors and defense mechanisms. Rescue in an agar-based assay for LK38 entirely depended upon the PMK-1/p38 MAPK pathway. Three compounds, LK32, LK34, and LK56 also conferred resistance to Enterococcus faecalis, and the two lattermost, LK34 and LK56, also reduced pathogenesis from Staphylococcus aureus. This study supports a growing role for MDT-15 and NHR-49 in immune response and identifies 5 molecules that with significant potential for use as tools in the investigation of innate immunity.\n\nAuthor SummaryTwo trends moving in opposite directions (the increase in antimicrobial resistance and the decline of commercial interest in the discovery and development of novel antimicrobials) have precipitated a looming crisis: a nearly complete inability to safely and effectively treat bacterial infections. To avert this, new approaches in healthcare are needed. One approach that is receiving increasing attention is to stimulate host defense pathways, to improve the clearance of bacterial infections. We describe five small molecules that promote host resistance to infectious bacteria, at least partially by activating C. elegans innate immune pathways. Several are effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Three molecules, LK34, LK35, and LK38 have highly overlapping downstream target genes, suggesting that they act on common pathways, despite having distinct chemical structures. One of the compounds was mapped to the action of MDT-15/MED15 and NHR-49/HNF4, a pair of transcriptional regulators more generally associated with fatty acid metabolism, potentially highlighting a new link between these biological functions. These studies pave the way for future characterization of the anti-infective activity of the molecules in higher organisms and highlight the compounds potential utility for further investigation of immune modulation as a novel therapeutic approach.",

    "abstract": "Technological advances and decreasing costs have led to the rise of increasingly dense genotyping data, making feasible the identification of potential causal markers. Custom genotyping chips, which combine medium-density genotypes with a custom genotype panel, can capitalize on these candidates to potentially yield improved accuracy and interpretability in genomic prediction. A particularly promising model to this end is BayesR, which divides markers into four effect size classes. BayesR has been shown to yield accurate predictions and promise for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping in real data applications, but an extensive benchmarking in simulated data is currently lacking. Based on a set of real genotypes, we generated simulated data under a variety of genetic architectures, phenotype heritabilities, and we evaluated the impact of excluding or including causal markers among the genotypes. We define several statistical criteria for QTL mapping, including several based on sliding windows to account for linkage disequilibrium. We compare and contrast these statistics and their ability to accurately prioritize known causal markers. Overall, we confirm the strong predictive performance for BayesR in moderately to highly heritable traits, particularly for 50k custom data. In cases of low heritability or weak linkage disequilibrium with the causal marker in 50k genotypes, QTL mapping is a challenge, regardless of the criterion used. BayesR is a promising approach to simultaneously obtain accurate predictions and interpretable classifications of SNPs into effect size classes. We illustrated the performance of BayesR in a variety of simulation scenarios, and compared the advantages and limitations of each.",

    "abstract": "ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with high-throughput sequencing) provides an efficient way to analyze nucleosome-free regions and has been applied widely to identify transcription factor footprints. Both applications rely on the accurate quantification of insertion events of the hyperactive transposase Tn5. However, due to the presence of the PCR amplification, it is impossible to accurately distinguish independently generated identical Tn5 insertion events from PCR duplicates using the standard ATAC-seq technique. Removing PCR duplicates based on mapping coordinates introduces an increasing bias towards highly accessible chromatin regions. To overcome this limitation, we establish a UMI-ATAC-seq technique by incorporating unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) into standard ATAC-seq procedures. In our study, UMI-ATAC-seq can rescue about 20% of reads that are mistaken as PCR duplicates in standard ATAC-seq, which helps identify an additional 50% or more of footprints. We demonstrate that UMI-ATAC-seq could more accurately quantify chromatin accessibility and significantly improve the sensitivity of identifying transcription factor footprints. An analytic pipeline is developed to facilitate the application of UMI-ATAC-seq, and it is available at https://github.com/tzhu-bio/UMI-ATAC-seq.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pose a major threat to the effective treatment and control of typhoid fever. The ongoing outbreak of extensively drug resistant (XDR) Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) in Pakistan has left azithromycin as the only remaining broadly efficacious oral antimicrobial for typhoid in South Asia. Ominously, azithromycin resistant S. Typhi organisms have been subsequently reported in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal.\n\nMethodsHere, we aimed to understand the molecular basis of AMR in 66 S. Typhi isolated in a cross-sectional study performed in a suburb of Chandigarh in Northern India using whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phylogenetic analysis.\n\nResultsWe identified seven S. Typhi organisms with the R717Q mutation in the acrB gene that was recently found to confer resistance to azithromycin in Bangladesh. Six out of the azithromycin-resistant S. Typhi isolates also exhibited triple mutations in gyrA (S83F and D87N) and parC (S80I) genes and were resistant to ciprofloxacin. These contemporary ciprofloxacin/azithromycin-resistant isolates were phylogenetically distinct from each other and from those reported from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Nepal.\n\nConclusionsThe independent emergence of azithromycin resistant typhoid in Northern India reflects an emerging broader problem across South Asia and illustrates the urgent need for the introduction of typhoid conjugate vaccines (TCVs) in the region.\n\nKey pointsWe identified ciprofloxacin/azithromycin-resistant Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) in Chandigarh in Northern India. The independent emergence of ciprofloxacin/azithromycin-resistant typhoid in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, and India and the continued spread of extensively-drug resistant (XDR) typhoid in Pakistan highlight the limitations of licensed oral treatments for typhoid fever in South Asia.",

    "abstract": "MADS-box gene family members play multifarious roles in regulating the growth and development of crop plants and hold enormous promise for bolstering grain yield potential under changing global environments. Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a key stable food crop around the globe. Until now, the available information concerning MADS-box genes in the wheat genome has been insufficient. However, a comprehensive genome-wide analysis identified 300 high confidence MADS-box genes from the latest publicly available reference genome of wheat. Comparative phylogenetic analyses with Arabidopsis and rice MADS-box genes classified the wheat genes into 16 distinct subfamilies, without a single FLOWERING LOCUS C homolog present in the wheat genome. Gene duplications were mainly identified in subfamilies containing unbalanced homeologs, pointing towards a potential mechanism for gene family expansion. Moreover, a more recent evolutionary origin was inferred for M-type genes, as compared with MIKC-type genes, indicating their significance in understanding the evolutionary history of the wheat genome. We speculate that subfamily-specific distal telomeric duplications in unbalanced homeologs facilitate the rapid adaptation of wheat to changing environments. Furthermore, our in-silico expression data strongly proposed MADS-box genes as active guardians of plants against pathogen insurgency and harsh environmental conditions. In conclusion, we provide an entire complement of MADS-box genes identified in the wheat genome that will accelerate functional genomics efforts and possibly facilitate bridging gaps between genotype-to-phenotype relationships through fine-tuning of agronomically important traits.",

The mice were flown for 37 days in animal enclosure modules on the International Space Station; ground-based control animals were maintained under similar housing conditions. Mouse retinas were isolated and both DNA methylome and transcriptome were determined by deep sequencing. We found that a large number of genes were differentially methylated with spaceflight, whereas there were fewer differentially expressed genes at the transcriptome level. Several biological pathways involved in retinal diseases such as macular degeneration were significantly altered. Our results indicated that spaceflight decelerated the retinal epigenetic clock. This study demonstrates that spaceflight impacts the retina at the epigenomic and transcriptomic levels, and such changes could be involved in the etiology of eye-related disorders among astronauts.",

    "abstract": "Structures of membrane proteins are challenging to determine experimentally and currently represent only about 2% of the structures in the ProteinDataBank. Because of this disparity, methods for modeling membrane proteins are fewer and of lower quality than those for modeling soluble proteins. However, better expression, crystallization, and cryo-EM techniques have prompted a recent increase in experimental structures of membrane proteins, which can act as templates to predict the structure of closely related proteins through homology modeling. Because homology modeling relies on a structural template, it is easier and more accurate than fold recognition methods or de novo modeling, which are used when the sequence similarity between the query sequence and the sequence of related proteins in structural databases is below 25%. In homology modeling, a query sequence is mapped onto the coordinates of a single template and refined. With the increase in available templates, several templates often cover overlapping segments of the query sequence. Multi-template modeling can be used to identify the best template for local segments and join them into a single model. Here we provide a protocol for modeling membrane proteins from multiple templates in the Rosetta software suite. This approach takes advantage of several integrated frameworks, namely RosettaScripts, RosettaCM, and RosettaMP with the membrane scoring function.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWIn molecular biology, just as in many other fields of science, data often come in the form of matrices or contingency tables with many measurements (rows) for a set of variables (columns). While projection methods like Principal Component Analysis or Correspondence Analysis can be applied for obtaining an overview of such data, in cases where the matrix is very large the associated loss of information upon projection into two or three dimensions may be dramatic. However, when the set of variables can be grouped into clusters, this opens up a new angle on the data. We focus on the question which measurements are associated to a cluster and distinguish it from other clusters. Correspondence Analysis employs a geometry geared towards answering this question. We exploit this feature in order to introduce Association Plots for visualizing cluster-specific measurements in complex data. Association Plots are two-dimensional, independent of the size of data matrix or cluster, and depict the measurements associated to a cluster of variables. We demonstrate our method first on a small data set and then on a genomic example comprising more than 10,000 conditions. We will show that Association Plots can clearly highlight those measurements which characterize a cluster of variables.",

    "abstract": "MotivationProtein structure prediction is one of the most significant problems in bioinformatics, as it has a prominent role in understanding the function and evolution of proteins. Designing a computationally efficient but at the same time accurate prediction method remains a pressing issue, especially for sequences that we cannot obtain a sufficient amount of homologous information from existing protein sequence databases. Several studies demonstrate the potential of utilizing chaos game representation (CGR) along with time series analysis tools such as recurrence quantification analysis (RQA), complex networks, horizontal visibility graphs (HVG) and others. However, the majority of existing works involve a large amount of features and they require an exhaustive, time consuming search of the optimal parameters. To address the aforementioned problems, this work adopts the generalized multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis (GmdRQA) as an efficient tool that enables to process concurrently a multidimensional time series and reduce the number of features. In addition, two data-driven algorithms, namely average mutual information (AMI) and false nearest neighbors (FNN), are utilized to define in a fast yet precise manner the optimal GmdRQA parameters.\n\nResultsThe classification accuracy is improved by the combination of GmdRQA with the HVG. Experimental evaluation on a real benchmark dataset demonstrates that our methods achieve similar performance with the state-of-the-art but with a smaller computational cost.\n\nAvailabilityThe code to reproduce all the results is available at https://github.com/aretiz/protein_structure_classification/tree/main.\n\nContactedoutsi@ics.forth.gr\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Mechanosensitive focal adhesion complexes mediate the dynamic interactions between cells and substrates, and regulate cellular function. Integrins in adhesion complexes link substrate ligands to stress fibers in the cytoskeleton, and aid in load transfer and traction generation during cell adhesion and migration. A repertoire of signaling molecules, including calcium, facilitate this process. We develop a novel one-dimensional, multi-scale, stochastic finite element model of a fibroblast on a substrate which includes calcium signaling, stress fiber remodeling, and focal adhesion dynamics that describes the formation and clustering of integrins to substrate ligands. We link the stochastic dynamics involving motor-clutches at focal adhesions to continuum level stress fiber contractility at various locations along the cell length. The stochastic module links to a calcium signaling module, via IP3 generation, and adaptor protein dyanamics through feedback. We use the model to quantify changes in cellular responses with substrate stiffness, ligand density, and cyclic stretch. Results show that tractions and integrin recruitments vary along the cell length and depend critically on interactions between the stress fiber and reversibly engaging adaptor proteins. Maximum tractions and integrin recruitments were present at the lamellar regions. Cytosolic calcium increased with substrate stiffness and ligand density. The optimal substrate stiffness, based on maximum tractions exerted by the cell, shifted towards stiffer substrates at high ligand densities. Cyclic stretch increased the cytosolic calcium and tractions at lamellipodial and intermediate cell regions. Tractions and integrin recruitments showed biphasic responses with substrate stiffness that increased with ligand density under stretch. The optimal substrate stiffness under stretch shifted towards compliant substrates at a given ligand density. Cells deadhere under stretch, characterized by near-zero recruitments and tractions, beyond a critical substrate stiffness. The coupling of stress fiber contractility to adhesion dynamics is essential in determining cellular responses under external mechanical perturbations.\n\nStatement of SignificanceCells are exquisitely sensitive to substrate ligand density, stiffness, and cyclic stretch. How do cell-substrate interactions change under cyclic stretch? We use a systems biology approach to develop a one-dimensional, multi-scale, stochastic finite element model of cellular adhesions to substrates which includes focal adhesion attachment dynamics, stress fiber activation, and calcium signaling. We quantify tractions along the cell length in response to variations in substrate stiffness, cyclic stretching, and differential ligand densities. Calcium signaling changes the stress fiber contractility and focal adhesion dynamics under stretch and substrate stiffness. Cell tractions and adhesions show a biphasic response with substrate stiffness that increased with higher ligand density and cyclic stretch.

Most approaches to date, however, rely on the availability of fresh surgical specimens, thereby dramatically reducing the ability to profile particularly rare tissue types. Pediatric central nervous system tumors - the leading cause of childhood cancer deaths - represent one such example, where often only frozen rather than native material is available. Due to an increasing need for advanced techniques to understand the heterogeneity of these tumors, we optimized a method to isolate intact nuclei from long-term frozen pediatric glioma tissues. We performed a technical comparison between different single nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) systems using a patient-derived xenograft model as a test sample. Further, we applied the established nucleus isolation method to analyze frozen primary tissue from two pediatric central nervous system tumors - one pilocytic astrocytoma and one glioblastoma - allowing the identification of distinct tumor cell populations and infiltrating microglia. The results show that our fast, simple and low-cost nuclear isolation protocol provides intact nuclei, which can be used in both droplet-based 3 transcriptome amplification (10X Genomics) and plate-based whole transcriptome amplification (Fluidigm C1) single-cell sequencing platforms, thereby dramatically increasing the potential for application of such methods to rare entities.",

    "abstract": "Goblet cells (GCs) are specialized cells of the intestinal epithelium contributing critically to mucosal homeostasis. One of the functions of GCs is to produce and secrete MUC2, the mucin that forms the scaffold of the intestinal mucus layer coating the epithelium and separates the luminal pathogens and commensal microbiota from the host tissues. Although a variety of ion channels and transporters are thought to impact on MUC2 secretion, the specific cellular mechanisms that regulate GC function remain incompletely understood. Previously, we demonstrated that leucine-rich-repeat-containing protein 26 (LRRC26), a known regulatory subunit of the Ca2+-and voltage-activated K+ channel (BK channel), localizes specifically to secretory cells within the intestinal tract. Here, utilizing a mouse model in which MUC2 is fluorescently tagged allowing visualization of single GCs in intact colonic crypts, we show that murine colonic GCs have functional LRRC26-associated BK channels. In the absence of LRRC26, BK channels are present in GCs, but are not activated at physiological conditions. In contrast, all tested MUC2-negative cells completely lacked BK channels. Moreover, LRRC26-associated BK channels underlie the BK channel contribution to the resting transepithelial current across mouse distal colonic mucosa. Genetic ablation of either LRRC26 or BK-pore forming -subunit in mice results in a dramatically enhanced susceptibility to colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). These results demonstrate that normal potassium flux through LRRC26-associated BK channels in GCs has protective effects against colitis in mice.\n\nSignificanceA primary function of goblet cells (GCs) of the intestinal epithelium is to generate a protective mucus layer lining the intestinal lumen. GC dysfunction is linked to Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). GC mucus secretion is thought to be dependent on contributions of an ensemble of anion and cation fluxes, although understanding remains limited. Here, it is shown in mouse colon that the Ca2+- and voltage-dependent BK-type K+ channel, specifically in association with the LRRC26 regulatory subunit, plays a critical role in normal GC function, protecting mice against chemically-induced colitis. The results demonstrate that normal K+ fluxes mediated by LRRC26-containing BK channels are required for normal GC function, potentially providing insights into the potential role of BK channels in IBD.",

    "abstract": "Microfluidic-based production of cellular mimics (e.g. giant vesicles) presents a paradigm-shift in the development of artificial cells. While encapsulation rates are high and vesicles are mono-disperse compared to swelling-based techniques, current microfluidic emulsion-based methods heavily rely on the addition of additives such as surfactants, glycerol and even ethanol to produce stable vesicles. In this work, we present a microfluidic platform designed for the production of cellular mimics in the form of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). Our PDMS-based device comprises a double cross-junction and a serpentine-shaped shear inducing module to produce surfactant-free and additive-free monodisperse biomimetic GUVs. Vesicles can be made with neutral and charged lipids in physiological buffers and, unlike previous works, it is possible to produce them with pure water both inside and outside. By not employing surfactants such as block co-polymers, additives like glycerol, and long-chain poly-vinyl alcohol that are known to alter the properties of lipid membranes, the vesicles are rendered truly biomimetic. The membrane functionality and stability are validated by lipid diffusion, membrane protein incorporation, and leakage assays. To demonstrate the usability of the GUVs using this method, various macromolecules such as DNA, smaller liposomes, mammalian cells and even microspheres are encapsulated within the GUVs.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant signaling through insulin (Ins) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) receptors contributes to the risk and advancement of many cancer types by activating cell survival cascades. Mechanistic computational modeling of such pathways provides insights into each components role in the cell response. In previous computational models, the two receptors were treated as indistinguishable, missing the opportunity to delineate their distinct roles in cancer progression. Here, a dual receptor (IGF1R & InsR) computational model elucidated new experimental hypotheses on how differential early responses emerge. Complementary to our previous findings, the model suggested that the regulation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) is critical in inducing differential MAPK and Akt activation. As predicted, perturbing ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6K) kinase activity led to an increased Akt activation with insulin stimulation compared to IGF1 stimulation. Being able to discern differential downstream signaling, we can explore improved anti-IGF1R cancer therapies by eliminating emergence of compensation mechanisms, without disrupting InsR signaling.\n\nImplicationsThe study shows, both experimentally and through computational models, that IGF1 and insulin receptor signaling pathways respond differently to RPS6K inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Gut microbiota has been shown to involve in many physiological functions such as metabolism, brain development, and neuron degeneration disease. Intriguingly, many microbes in the digestive tract do not maintain a constant level of their relative abundance but show daily oscillations under normal conditions. Recent evidence indicates that chronic jetlag, constant darkness, or deletion of the circadian core gene can alter the composition of gut microbiota and dampen the daily oscillation of gut microbes. These studies suggest that the interaction between the host circadian clock and the light-dark cycle plays an important role in gut homeostasis and microbiota. However, how or whether environmental factors such as the light-dark cycle could modulate gut microbiota is still poorly understood. Using genetic mouse models and 16s rRNA metagenomic analysis, we found that light-dark cycle information transmitted by the ipRGC-sympathetic circuit was essential for daily oscillations of gut microbes under temporal restricted high fat diet condition. Furthermore, aberrant light exposure such as dim light at night (dLAN), acting through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), could alter the composition, relative abundance, and daily oscillations of gut microbiota. Together, our results indicate that external stimulation, such as light-dark cycle information, through the sensory system can modulate gut microbiota in the direction from the brain to the gut.",

    "abstract": "Many contexts in motor learning require a learner to change from an existing movement solution to a novel movement solution to perform the same task. Recent evidence has pointed to motor variability prior to learning as a potential marker for predicting individual differences in motor learning. However, it is not known if this variability is predictive of the ability to adopt a new movement solution for the same task. Here, we examined this question in the context of a redundant precision task requiring control of motor variability. Fifty young adults learned a precision task that involved throwing a virtual puck toward a target using both hands. Because the speed of the puck depended on the sum of speeds of both hands, this task could be achieved using multiple solutions. Participants initially performed a baseline task where there was no constraint on the movement solution, and then performed a novel task where they were constrained to adopt a specific movement solution requiring asymmetric left and right hand speeds. Results showed that participants were able to learn the new solution, and this change was associated with changes in both the amount and structure of variability. However, individual differences in baseline motor variability were only weakly correlated with initial and final task performance when using the new solution, with greater variability being associated with higher errors. We also found a strong specificity component - initial variability when using the new solution was highly correlated with final task performance with the new solution, but once again, higher variability was associated with greater errors. These results suggest that motor variability is not necessarily indicative of flexibility and highlight the need to consider the task context in determining the relation between motor variability and learning.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveGastric cancer (GC) tumors are highly heterogenous with different subpopulations of epithelial cells. We employed single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect the heterogeneity and identified subpopulations of cancer cells with stem-like properties. We further investigated their resistance to oxaliplatin chemotherapy and their contribution to gastric cancer outcome.\n\nDesignWe performed scRNA-seq on FACS sorted epithelial and immune cells from paired samples of GC tumors and normal adjacent tissues. We identified two epithelial subpopulations (STMN1+IQGAP3+ and STMN1+IQGAP3-) with stem-like properties. We characterized and compared them to known healthy gastric stem cell populations. We also cultivated GC derived organoids to study the chemoresistance of similarly marked populations. Lastly, we employed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining to ascertain the predicted immunosuppressive interactions.\n\nResultsThe STMN1+IQGAP3+ subpopulation showed a higher tumor mutation burden, upregulated proliferative pathways and transcriptomically resembled proliferative healthy gastric isthmus stem cells. The STMN1+IQGAP3- subpopulation were comparatively quiescent and transcriptomically resembled enteroendocrine cells. Both transcriptomic signatures were associated with worse mortality than other epithelial subpopulations with the quiescent being associated with the poorest patient survival.\n\nGC tissue derived organoids were dominated by STMN1+IQGAP3+ cells but the STMN1+IQGAP3- compartment was more resistant to chemotherapy. We also verified the likely suppression of CD8 T cell cytotoxicity by STMN1+IQGAP3+ cells through the NECTIN2/TIGIT interaction.\n\nConclusionsCancer cells with stem-like characteristics are associated with poor survival through chemoresistance and immunosuppression. Reactivating the immune system through checkpoint blockade is an opportunity to eliminate these cells.\n\nWhat is already known on this topicMultiple gastric stem cell populations have been identified and linked to tumor initiation in rodent-based studies. However, none of them have been conclusively proven in human tumors. Isolating and characterizing tumor cells with stem-like properties will help shed light on their possible origin and possible mitigation strategies.\n\nWhat this study addsHere we identified two sets of stem-like gastric cancer cells that are associated with poorer patient prognosis. One set is highly proliferative and exhibits oxaliplatin susceptibility. It also engages in immunosuppressive interactions such as NECTIN2/TIGIT. The other set is quiescent and highly resistant to oxaliplatin.\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice or policyThe transcriptome signatures of the identified stem-like cells can aid in patient prognosis and identify patients who can benefit from checkpoint blockade therapy to reactivate their immune response towards gastric cancer cells.",

The conductivity of these periplasmic wires is exceptionally high for a biological material, but their chemical structure and underlying electron transport mechanism remain unresolved. Here, we combine high-resolution microscopy, spectroscopy, and chemical imaging on individual cable bacterium filaments to demonstrate that the periplasmic wires consist of a conductive protein core surrounded by an insulating shell layer. The core proteins contain a sulfur-ligated nickel cofactor, and conductivity decreases when nickel is oxidized or selectively removed. The involvement of nickel as the active metal in biological conduction is remarkable, and suggests a hitherto unknown form of electron transport that enables efficient conduction in centimeter-long protein structures.",

    "abstract": "An important prelude to bacterial infection is the ability of a pathogen to survive independently of the host and to withstand environmental stress. The compatible solute trehalose has previously been connected with diverse abiotic stress tolerances, particularly osmotic shock. In this study, we combine molecular biology and biochemistry to dissect the trehalose metabolic network in the opportunistic human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 and define its role in abiotic stress protection. We show that trehalose metabolism in PA01 is integrated with the biosynthesis of branched -glucan (glycogen), with mutants in either biosynthetic pathway significantly compromised for survival on abiotic surfaces. While both trehalose and -glucan are important for abiotic stress tolerance, we show they counter distinct stresses. Trehalose is vital to the PA01 osmotic stress response, with trehalose synthesis mutants displaying severely compromised growth in elevated salt conditions. However, trehalose does not contribute directly to the PA01 desiccation response. Rather, desiccation tolerance is mediated directly by GlgE-derived -glucan, with deletion of the glgE synthase gene compromising PA01 survival in low humidity but having little effect on osmotic sensitivity. Desiccation tolerance is independent of trehalose concentration, marking a clear distinction between the roles of these two molecules in mediating responses to abiotic stress.",

However, numerous studies investigating the role of urban green spaces have established their key role in conserving larger suites of species in urban area. Yet our knowledge is lopsided due to lag in research in developing countries. We examined how landscape and local scale features of urban green spaces influence bird species richness, density, fine-foraging guild richness and composition during breeding and non-breeding season. This is the first study of this nature in one the Himalayan states of India. We quantified landscape level variables in the 250m buffer around 18 urban green spaces. We sampled vegetation and bird community during breeding and non-breeding season through 52 intensive sampling point spread across 18 urban green spaces. Size of the urban green space at landscape level and tree richness at the local scale emerged as important predictor variables influencing bird species richness, density and richness of imperiled insectivorous guild across seasons. Urban green spaces within education institutions and offices experiencing much less management supported higher bird richness and density whereas city parks were the most species poor. Community composition was affected more strongly by built-up cover and barren area in the matrix and also by tree species richness within urban green spaces. City planners should focus on establishing larger city parks during design stage whereas biodiversity potential of the existing urban green spaces could be enhanced by selecting native tree and shrub species to increase overall habitat complexity.",

But it is not yet well-understood how clearly morphological data from fossil taxa speak to detailed questions of speciation mode as compared to the lineage diversification models that serve as their basis. In addition, the congruence of inferences made using these approaches with geographic patterns has not been explored. Here, I extend a previously introduced maximum-likelihood approach for the examination of ancestor-descendant relationships to accommodate budding speciation and apply it to a dataset of fossil hominins. I place these results in a phylogeographic context to better understand spatial dynamics underlying the hypothesized speciation patterns. The spatial patterns implied by the phylogeny hint at the complex demographic processes underlying the spread and diversification of hominins throughout the Pleistocene. I also find that inferences of budding are driven primarily by stratigraphic, versus morphological, data and discuss the ramifications for interpretations of speciation process in hominins specifically and from phylogenetic data in general.",

While the functioning and emergence of sex chromosomes have been explored in species scattered across the eukaryotic tree of life, little is known about tempo and mode of sex chromosome evolution in closely related species. Here, we examine the dynamics of sex chromosome evolution in an archetypical example of adaptive radiation, the cichlid fishes of African Lake Tanganyika. Through inspection of male and female genomes from 244 cichlid taxa and the analysis of transcriptomes from 66 taxa, we identify signatures of sex chromosomes in 79 taxa, involving 12 different linkage groups. We estimate that Tanganyikan cichlids have the highest rates of sex chromosome turnover and heterogamety transitions known to date. We further show that the recruitment of chromosomes as sex chromosomes is not at random and that some chromosomes have convergently emerged as sex chromosomes in cichlids, which provides empirical support to the \"limited options\" hypothesis of sex chromosome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriocins, toxic peptides involved in the competition between bacterial strains, are extremely diverse. Previous work on bacteriocin dynamics has highlighted the role of non-transitive  rock-paper-scissors competition in maintaining the coexistence of different bacteriocin profiles. The focus to date has primarily been on bacteriocin interactions at the within-host scale. Yet, in species such as Streptococcus pneumoniae with relatively short periods of colonisation and limited within-host diversity, ecological outcomes are also shaped by processes at the epidemiological (between-host) scale. Here, we first investigate bacteriocin dynamics and diversity in epidemiological models. We find that in these models, bacteriocin diversity is more readily maintained than in within-host models, and with more possible combinations of coexisting bacteriocin profiles. Indeed, maintenance of diversity in epidemiological models does not require rock-paper-scissors dynamics; it can also occur through a competition-colonisation trade-off. Second, we investigate the link between bacteriocin diversity and diversity at antibiotic resistance loci. Previous work has proposed that bacterial duration of colonisation modulates the fitness of antibiotic resistance. Due to their inhibitory effects, bacteriocins are a plausible candidate for playing a role in the duration of colonisation episodes. We extend the epidemiological model of bacteriocin dynamics to incorporate an antibiotic resistance locus and demonstrate that bacteriocin diversity can indeed maintain the coexistence of antibiotic sensitive and resistant strains.",

Using current knowledge on class A GPCRs and existing experimental data in the literature as constraints, we pinpointed conserved motifs to entirely re-align the amino-acid sequences of TAS2Rs. We constructed accurate homology models of human TAS2Rs. As a test case, we examined the accuracy of the TAS2R16 model with site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro functional assays.

    "abstract": "Developing an automatic tumor detector for MRI medical images is a major challenge in neuro-oncology. The availability of such a tool would be a valuable assistance for the radiologists. Numerous works have tried to segment the tumor tissues, others have attempted to localize the tumor globally. In this work we focus on this second class of methods and we compare two drastically different strategies. The first one is an assumption-free anomaly detector build over a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), and the second one is a VGG classifier that embed Attention-Gated (AG) units to focus on the target structures at almost no additional computational cost. This comparison is first conducted on the publicly available BraTS glioma dataset for which published performance results can serve as reference, and extended as such (ie., without transfer learning) to two internal image datasets, namely Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) and Metastasis. The results demonstrate that the VAE and AG-VGG strategies can be used, up to a certain extent, to localize brain tumors.",

    "abstract": "The conserved Notch signaling pathway coordinates diverse cellular processes during animal development. Unlike most cell surface receptors that use a cytoplasmic cascade to amplify and diversify signaling dynamics, Notch itself transduces external cues directly to the nucleus. How appropriate signaling dynamics and transcriptional responses are achieved with this pathway architecture remains unclear. Here, we report that the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase Abelson (Abl) fine-tunes Notch signaling by regulating Notch endocytic trafficking. We show that Abl can directly phosphorylate a PPxY motif important for Nedd4-family ubiquitin-ligase-mediated transfer of Notch into degradative endosomal compartments. Consistent with this, loss of Abl or inhibition of its kinase activity results in aberrant endosomal accumulation of Notch, while mutation of the PPxY tyrosine renders Notch insensitive to such regulation. Phenotypic and genetic interaction studies in the wing, together with parallel assays in cultured cells, show that loss or gain of Abl activity can respectively increase or decrease Notch output. We propose that the Notch PPxY motif operates as a molecular hub that integrates multiple post-translational modifications to regulate Notch trafficking and fine-tune signaling output.",

    "abstract": "Sparse coding is an important method for unsupervised learning of task-independent features in theoretical neuroscience models of neural coding. While a number of algorithms exist to learn these representations from the statistics of a dataset, they largely ignore the information bottlenecks present in fiber pathways connecting cortical areas. For example, the visual pathway has many fewer neurons transmitting visual information to cortex than the number of photoreceptors. Both empirical and analytic results have recently shown that sparse representations can be learned effectively after performing dimensionality reduction with randomized linear operators, producing latent coefficients that preserve information. Unfortunately, current proposals for sparse coding in the compressed space require a centralized compression process (i.e., dense random matrix) that is biologically unrealistic due to local wiring constraints observed in neural circuits. The main contribution of this paper is to leverage recent results on structured random matrices to propose a theoretical neuroscience model of randomized projections for communication between cortical areas that is consistent with the local wiring constraints observed in neuroanatomy. We show analytically and empirically that unsupervised learning of sparse representations can be performed in the compressed space despite significant local wiring constraints in compression matrices of varying forms (corresponding to different local wiring patterns). Our analysis verifies that even with significant local wiring constraints, the learned representations remain qualitatively similar, have similar quantitative performance in both training and generalization error, and are consistent across many measures with measured macaque V1 receptive fields.",

We utilized three independent published studies to acquire or generate lists of differentially expressed genes between control and SARS-CoV-2-infected samples. Using a rank-based pattern matching strategy based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic, the signatures were queried against drug profiles from Connectivity Map (CMap). We validated sixteen of our top predicted hits in live SARS-CoV-2 antiviral assays in either Calu-3 or 293T-ACE2 cells. Validation experiments in human cell lines showed that 11 of the 16 compounds tested to date (including clofazimine, haloperidol and others) had measurable antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. These initial results are encouraging as we continue to work towards a further analysis of these predicted drugs as potential therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19.",

Here, we used anterograde and retrograde tracing in macaques to map the innervation zone of area 44 corticostriatal projections, quantify their strengths, and evaluate their convergence with corticostriatal projections from non-motor and motor-related frontal regions. First, terminal fields from a rostral area 44 injection site were found primarily in the central caudate nucleus, whereas those from a caudal area 44 injection site were found primarily in the ventrolateral putamen. Second, amongst sampled striatal retrograde injection sites, area 44 input as a percentage of total frontal cortical input was highest in the ventral putamen at the level of the anterior commissure. Third, area 44 projections converged with both orofacial premotor area 6VR and other motor related projections (in the putamen), and with non-motor prefrontal projections (in the caudate nucleus). These findings support the role of area 44 as an interface between motor and non-motor functional domains, possibly facilitated by rostral and caudal area 44 subregions with distinct corticostriatal connectivity profiles.",

We identified protein-coding genes whose polyadenylated transcripts were more abundant in chromatin than cytoplasm. We defined introns exhibiting cotranscriptional splicing, complete intron retention in cytoplasmic RNA, and many introns retained in nucleoplasmic and chromatin RNA but absent from cytoplasmic RNA, including new introns controlled during neuronal development. In particular, we found that polyadenylated Gabbr1 transcripts are expressed in mESC but remain sequestered on chromatin until neuronal differentiation when they are processed and released to the cytoplasm. This developmental regulation of splicing and chromatin association demonstrates that the abundance of polyadenylated RNA is not always an indicator of functional gene expression. Our datasets provide a rich resource for analyzing many other aspects of mRNA maturation.",

Here, using a broken tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and disrupted electron transport chain (ETC) exemplified by succinate dehydrogenase subunit C (SDHC) deficiency, we investigated the effects of metabolism on chromatin architecture over multiple distance scales [nucleosomes ([~]102 bp), topologically-associated domains (TADs; [~]105 - 106 bp), and chromatin compartments (106 - 108 bp)]. Metabolically-driven hyperacylation of histones led to weakened nucleosome positioning in multiple types of chromatin, and we further demonstrate that lysine acylation directly destabilizes histone octamer-DNA interactions. Hyperacylation of cohesin subunits correlated with decreased mobility on interphase chromatin and increased TAD boundary strength, suggesting that cohesin is metabolically regulated. Erosion of chromatin compartment distinctions reveals metabolic regulation of chromatin liquid-liquid phase separation. The TCA cycle and ETC thus modulate chromatin structure over multiple distance scales.",

Here we formulate a boundary value problem that predicts the direction and extent of lactate fluxes within the human placenta under various physiological conditions. It accounts for metabolic processes within the placenta and transporters activity at the two membranes that confine the terminal villi. Lactate concentration inside the terminal villi and its fluxes at the membranes are being computed. Under normal conditions lactate flux from fetal arterioles to the placenta surpasses the flux to the fetus via the umbilical vein. Within the placenta, it adds to the lactate that originates in the glycolysis, some of it degrades to pyruvate and surpluses are delivered to the maternal circulation. The apparent permeabilities of the placental membranes with respect to lactate as well as the specific characterizations of the placental lactate production, hitherto unknown, are being estimated. We determine the range of parameter values that induce sustainable, healthy fetal lactate levels and demonstrate the versatility of lactate exchange between the placenta and the fetus by computing the effect of extreme conditions (e.g., cesarean section, intrauterine growth restriction) on lactate fluxes.",

It is common in the scientific literature to consider these two species as synonyms, referred to as the  sugarcane aphid, although no formal study has validated this synonymy. In this study, based on the comparison of samples collected from their whole distribution area, we use both morphometric and molecular data to better characterize the discrimination between M. sacchari and M. sorghi. An unsupervised multivariate analysis of morphometric data clearly confirmed the separation of the two species. The best discriminating characters separating these species were length of the antenna processus terminalis relative to length of hind tibia, siphunculus or cauda. However, those criteria sometimes do not allow an unambiguous identification. Bayesian clustering based on microsatellite data delimited two clusters, which corresponded to the morphological species separation. The DNA sequencing of three nuclear and three mitochondrial regions revealed slight divergence between species. In particular, the COI barcode region proved to be uninformative for species separation because one haplotype is shared by both species. In contrast, one SNP located on the nuclear EF1- gene was diagnostic for species separation. Based on morphological and molecular evidence, the invasive genotype damaging to sorghum in the US, Mexico and the Caribbean since 2013 is found to be M. sorghi.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is challenging. Testing for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) in the lower genital tract is recommended, since a positive result supports the diagnosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of CT/NG infection in women suspected of having PID and the usefulness of a rapid molecular test to detect CT/NG.\n\nMethodsThis observational study included 3 groups of patients: mild-to-moderate PID (n=33), severe PID (n=29) and non-specific lower abdominal pain (NSAP) (n=13). CT/NG infection were analyzed using a standard and a rapid test. A cost analysis was carried out.\n\nResultsThe presence of CT/NG was determined in 75 endocervical and urine samples. Endocervical samples of 19 patients (25.3%) were CT/ NG positive (two cases of co-infection). NG was not detected in urine in one case. Concordance between rapid and standard tests was 100%. However, the mean time to achieve results was shorter with the rapid test: 2.22 vs. 24.37 hours, respectively (p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed in the presence of CT/NG in mild-to-moderate compared to severe PID. Costs differed according only to disease severity but to the presence of CT/NG. Only one patient with NSAP was positive for CT.\n\nConclusionsRapid molecular tests could help with the diagnosis of PID in sexually active women in clinical settings in which a standard technique is not available. Nonetheless, a positive test for CT/NG may not be determinant of the clinical management. The only cost difference relates to disease severity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe human gut microbiota exhibits marked variation around the world, which has been attributed to dietary intake and other environmental factors. However, the degree to which ethnicity-associated differences in gut microbial community structure and function are maintained following immigration or in the context of metabolic disease is poorly understood.\n\nResultsWe conducted a multi-omic study of 46 lean and obese East Asian and White participants living in the San Francisco Bay Area. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed significant differences between ethnic groups in bacterial richness and community structure. White individuals were enriched for the mucin-degrading Akkermansia muciniphila. East Asian participants had increased levels of multiple bacterial phyla, fermentative pathways detected by metagenomics, and the short-chain fatty acid end products acetate, propionate, and isobutyrate. Differences in the gut microbiota between the East Asian and White groups could not be explained by reported dietary intake, were more pronounced in lean individuals, and were associated with current geographical location. Microbiome transplantations into germ-free mice confirmed that the differences in the gut microbiota of the East Asian and White individuals we analyzed are independent of diet and that they differentially impact host body weight and adiposity in genetically identical mouse recipients.\n\nConclusionsThe reported findings emphasize the utility of studying diverse ethnic groups within a defined geographical location and provide a starting point for dissecting the mechanisms contributing to the complex interactions between the gut microbiome and ethnicity-associated lifestyle, demographic, metabolic, and genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Sensing of virus infection activates NF-{kappa}B to induce the expression of interferons, cytokines and chemokines to initiate the antiviral response. Viruses antagonise these antiviral defences by interfering with immune sensing and blocking the actions of antiviral and inflammatory molecules. Here, we show that a viral protein mimics the transactivation domain of the p65 subunit of NF-{kappa}B. The C terminus of vaccinia virus (VACV) protein F14 (residues 51-73) activates transcription when fused to a DNA-binding domain-containing protein and F14 associates with NF-{kappa}B co-activator CBP, disrupting p65-CBP interaction. Consequently, F14 diminishes CBP-mediated acetylation of p65 and the downstream recruitment of the transcriptional regulator BRD4 to the promoter of the NF-{kappa}B-responsive genes CXCL10 and CCL2, hence inhibiting their expression. Conversely, the recruitment of BRD4 to the promoters of NFKBIA, which encodes the inhibitor of NF-{kappa}B (I{kappa}B), and CXCL8 remains unaffected in the presence of either F14 or JQ1, a competitive inhibitor of BRD4 bromodomains, indicating its recruitment is acetylation-independent. Therefore, unlike other viral NF-{kappa}B antagonists, F14 is a selective inhibitor of NF-{kappa}B-dependent gene expression. A VACV strain lacking F14 showed that it contributes to virulence in an intradermal model of infection. Our results uncover a mechanism by which viruses disarm the antiviral defences through molecular mimicry of a conserved host protein and provide insight into the regulation of NF-{kappa}B-dependent gene expression by BRD4.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) has the unusual capacity to circumvent natural alternating mosquito-human transmission and be directly transmitted human-to-human via sexual and vertical routes. The impact of direct transmission on ZIKV evolution and adaptation to vertebrate hosts is unknown. Here we show that molecularly barcoded ZIKV rapidly adapted to a mammalian host during direct transmission chains in mice, coincident with the emergence of an amino acid substitution previously shown to enhance virulence. In contrast, little to no adaptation of ZIKV to mice was observed following chains of direct transmission in mosquitoes or alternating host transmission. Detailed genetic analyses revealed that ZIKV evolution in mice was generally more convergent and subjected to more relaxed purifying selection than in mosquitoes or alternate passages. These findings suggest that prevention of direct human transmission chains may be paramount to resist gains in ZIKV virulence.",

    "abstract": "Endophytes are symptomless fungal and/or bacterial microorganisms found in almost all living plant species. The symbiotic association with their host plants by colonizing the internal tissues has endowed them as a valuable tool to suppress diseases, to stimulate growth, and to promote stress resistance. In this context, the identification of cultivable endophytes residing the sapwood of Apulian olives might be a promising control strategy for xylem colonizing pathogens as Xylella fatidiosa. To date, olives sapwood cultivable endophytes are still under exploration; therefore, this work pursues a study of diversity and occurrence variation of cultivable endophytes in the sapwood of different olive varieties under the effect seasonality, geographical coordinates, and X. fastidiosa infection status. Briefly, our study confirms the stability of sapwood cultivable endophytic communities in the resistant olive variety, presents the seasonal and geographical fluctuation of olives sapwood endophytes, describes the diversity and occurrence frequency of fungal and bacterial genera, and finally retrieves some of sapwood-inhabiting fungal and bacterial isolates are known as biocontrol agents of plant pathogens. Thus, the potential role of these bacterial and fungal isolates in conferring olive tree protection against X. fastidiosa should be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Semi-arid eastern Kenya is a fragile ecosystem with continuous cultivation of dryland pulses and grains. Farmers use artificial fertilizers most of which are deleterious to the environment. Previous studies have shown that soil microbes in the rhizosphere could be used to sustainably enhance levels of soil mineral nutrients and soil health. However, few studies have examined fungal diversity in the rhizosphere of wild and native Aspilia pruliseta shrub. In this study, amplicons of Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region on Total Community DNA using Illumina sequencing were used to explore the fungal community composition within the rhizosphere. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were analyzed using QIIME 1.8.0, taxonomy assigned via BLASTn against SILVA 119 database. Hierarchical clustering was done using R programming software. 72,093, 50,539 and 43,506 sequence reads were obtained from samples MC1a, MC2a and MC3a respectively representing rhizosphere depth 0-20 cm, 21-40 cm and 41-60 cm. A total of 373 OTUs were realized at 3% genetic distance. Taxonomic analysis revealed that the genera Glomus was most prevalent in all soil depths with 85.60 % of the OTUs in depth 0-20 cm, 69.04 % in depth 21-40 cm and 48.45 % in depth 41-60 cm. The results revealed high levels of obligate arbuscular mycorrhiza fungi that if commercially cultured could enhance phosphates uptake in crops.",

    "abstract": "The Middle and Late Bronze Age Near East, a period roughly spanning the second millennium BC (ca. 2000-1200 BC), is frequently referred to as the first  international age, characterized by intense and far-reaching contacts between different entities from the eastern Mediterranean to the Near East and beyond. In a large-scale tandem study of stable isotopes and ancient DNA of individuals excavated at Tell Atchana (Alalakh), situated in the northern Levant, we explore the role of mobility at the capital of a regional kingdom. We generated strontium isotope data for 53 individuals, oxygen isotope data for 77 individuals, and added ancient DNA data from 9 new individuals to a recently published dataset of 28 individuals. A dataset like this, from a single site in the Near East, is thus far unparalleled in terms of both its breadth and depth, providing the opportunity to simultaneously obtain an in-depth view of individual mobility and also broader demographic insights into the resident population. The DNA data reveals a very homogeneous gene pool, with only one outlier. This picture of an overwhelmingly local ancestry is consistent with the evidence of local upbringing in most of the individuals indicated by the isotopic data, where only five were found to be  non-local. High levels of contact, trade, and exchange of ideas and goods in the Middle and Late Bronze Ages, therefore, seem not to have translated into high levels of individual mobility detectable at Tell Atchana.",
