    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge for bioelectronics is to deliver power to miniature devices inside the body. Wires are common failure points and limit device placement. On the other hand, wireless power by electromagnetic or ultrasound waves must overcome absorption by the body and impedance mismatches between air, bone, and tissue. In contrast, magnetic fields suffer little absorption by the body or differences in impedance at interfaces between air, bone, and tissue. These advantages have led to magnetically-powered stimulators based on induction or magnetothermal effects. However, fundamental limitations in these power transfer technologies have prevented miniature magnetically-powered stimulators from applications in many therapies and disease models because they do not operate in clinical \"high-frequency\" ranges above 50 Hz. Here we show that magnetoelectric materials - applied in bioelectronic devices - enable miniature magnetically-powered neural stimulators that can operate up to clinically-relevant high-frequencies. As an example, we show that ME neural stimulators can effectively treat the symptoms of a hemi-Parkinsons disease model in freely behaving rodents. We further demonstrate that ME-powered devices can be miniaturized to mm-sized devices, fully implanted, and wirelessly powered in freely behaving rodents. These results suggest that ME materials are an excellent candidate for wireless power delivery that will enable miniature bioelectronics for both clinical and research applications.",

    "abstract": "Multi-zinc finger proteins constitute the largest class of human transcription factors. Their DNA-binding specificity is usually encoded by a subset of their tandem Cys2His2 zinc finger (ZF) domains - the subset that binds to DNA, however, is often unknown. Here, by combining a context-aware machine-learning-based model of DNA recognition with in vivo binding data, we characterize the sequence preferences and the ZF subset that is responsible for DNA binding in 209 human multi-ZF proteins. We show that in vivo DNA binding is primarily driven by [~]50% of the ZFs - these DNA-binding ZFs are under strong selective pressure within and across species, and their mutations affect the expression of hundreds of genes as revealed by pan-cancer trans-eQTL analysis across 18 tissues. Among the genes affected by mutations in multi-ZF proteins, we identify several oncogenic factors regulated by SP1, and show that SP1 up-regulation in cancer promotes the expression of these genes while mutations in SP1 ZFs lead to their repression. Together, these analyses suggest that mutations in DNA-binding ZFs have distinct and widespread regulatory consequences that contribute to transcriptome remodelling in cancer.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial multiple drug resistance is a significant issue for the medical community. Gram-negative bacteria exhibit higher rates of multi-drug resistance, partly due to the impermeability of the Gram-negative bacterial cell wall and double-membrane cell envelope, which limits the internal accumulation of antibiotic agents. The outer lipopolysaccharide membrane regulates the transport of hydrophobic molecules, while the inner phospholipid membrane controls influx of hydrophilic particles. In Escherichia coli, the gene accA produces the acetyl-CoA carboxylase transferase enzyme required for catalyzing synthesis of fatty acids and phospholipids that compose the inner membrane. To increase antibiotic susceptibility and decrease growth, this study interrupted fatty acid synthesis and disrupted the composition of the inner membrane through inhibiting the gene accA with antisense RNA. This inhibition suppressed expression of luxS, a vital virulence factor that regulates cell growth, transfers intercellular quorum-sensing signals mediated by autoinducer-2, and is necessary for biofilm formation. Bacterial cells in which accA was inhibited also displayed a greater magnitude of antibiotic susceptibility. These findings confirm accA as a potent target for developing novel antibiotics such as antimicrobial gene therapies.",

    "abstract": "Although miRNAs can cause widespread changes in expression programs, single miRNAs typically induce mild repression on their targets. Cooperativity is reported as one strategy to overcome this constraint. Expanding the catalog of synergistic miRNAs is critical for understanding gene regulation and for developing miRNA-based therapeutics. In this study, we develop miRCoop to identify synergistic miRNA pairs that have weak or no repression on the target mRNA, but when bound together, induce strong repression. miRCoop uses kernel-based interaction tests together with miRNA and mRNA target information. We apply our approach to kidney tumor patient data and identify 66 putative triplets. For 64 of these triplets, there is at least one common transcription factor that potentially regulates all participating RNAs of the triplet, supporting a functional association among them. Furthermore, we find that triplets are enriched for certain biological processes that are relevant to kidney cancer. Some of the synergistic miRNAs are very closely encoded in the genome, hinting a functional association among them. We believe miRCoop can aid our understanding of the complex regulatory interactions in different health and disease states of the cell and can help in designing miRNA-based therapies.

    "abstract": "Probing the diffusion of molecules has become a routine measurement across the life sciences, chemistry and physics. It provides valuable insights into reaction dynamics, oligomerisation, molecular (re-)organisation or cellular heterogeneities. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) is one of the widely applied techniques to determine diffusion dynamics in two and three dimensions. This technique relies on the temporal autocorrelation of intensity fluctuations but recording these fluctuations has thus far been limited by the detection electronics, which could not efficiently and accurately time-tag photons at high count rates. This has until now restricted the range of measurable dye concentrations, as well as the data quality of the FCS recordings, especially in combination with super-resolution stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy.\n\nHere, we investigate the applicability and reliability of (STED-)FCS at high photon count rates (average intensities of up to 40 MHz) using novel detection equipment, namely hybrid detectors and real-time gigahertz sampling of the photon streams implemented on a commercial microscope. By measuring the diffusion of fluorophores in solution and cytoplasm of live cells, as well as in model and cellular membranes, we show that accurate diffusion and concentration measurements are possible in these previously inaccessible high photon count regimes. Specifically, it offers much greater flexibility of experiments with biological samples with highly variable intensity, e.g. due to a wide range of expression levels of fluorescent proteins. In this context, we highlight the independence of diffusion properties of cytosolic GFP in a concentration range of approx. 0.01-1 M. We further show that higher photon count rates also allow for much shorter acquisition times, and improved data quality. Finally, this approach also pronouncedly increases the robustness of challenging live cell STED-FCS measurements of nanoscale diffusion dynamics, which we testify by confirming a free diffusion pattern for a fluorescent lipid analogue on the apical membrane of adherent cells.",

    "abstract": "Flow cytometers have been utilized for the analysis of submicron-sized particles since the late 1970s. Initially, virus analyses preceded extracellular vesicle (EV), which began in the 1990s. Despite decades of documented use, the lack of standardization in data reporting has resulted in a growing body of literature that cannot be easily interpreted, validated, or reproduced. This has made it difficult for objective assessments of both assays and instruments, in-turn leading to significant hindrances in scientific progress, specifically in the study of EVs, where the phenotypic analysis of these submicron-sized vesicles is becoming common-place in every biomedical field. Methods for fluorescence and light scatter standardization are well established and the reagents to perform these analyses are commercially available. However, fluorescence and light scatter calibration are not widely adopted by the small particle community as methods to standardize flow cytometry data. In this proof-of-concept study carried out as a resource for use at the CYTO2019 workshop, we demonstrate for the first-time simultaneous fluorescence and light scatter calibration of small particle data to show the ease and feasibility of this method for standardized flow cytometry data reporting. This data was acquired using standard configuration commercial flow cytometers, with commercially available materials, published methods, and freely available software tools. We show that application of light scatter, fluorescence, and concentration calibration can result in highly concordant data between flow cytometry platforms independent of instrument collection angle, gain/voltage settings, and flow rate; thus, providing a means of cross-comparison in standard units.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) impacts millions annually, often leaving debilitated patients with minimal repair options to improve functional recovery. Our group has previously developed tissue engineered nerve grafts (TENGs) featuring long, aligned axonal tracts from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons that are fabricated in custom bioreactors using the process of axon \"stretch-growth\". We have shown that TENGs effectively serve as \"living scaffolds\" to promote regeneration across segmental nerve defects by exploiting the newfound mechanism of axon-facilitated axon regeneration, or \"AFAR\", by simultaneously providing haptic and neurotrophic support. To extend this work, the current study investigated the efficacy of living versus non-living regenerative scaffolds in preserving host sensory and motor neuronal health following nerve repair. Rats were assigned across five groups: naive, or repair using autograft, nerve guidance tube (NGT) with collagen, NGT + non-aligned DRG populations in collagen, or TENGs. We found that TENG repairs yielded equivalent regenerative capacity as autograft repairs based on preserved health of host spinal cord motor neurons and acute axonal regeneration, whereas NGT repairs or DRG neurons within an NGT exhibited reduced motor neuron preservation and diminished regenerative capacity. These acute regenerative benefits ultimately resulted in enhanced levels of functional recovery in animals receiving TENGs, at levels matching those attained by autografts. Our findings indicate that TENGs may preserve host spinal cord motor neuron health and regenerative capacity without sacrificing an otherwise uninjured nerve (as in the case of the autograft), and therefore represent a promising alternative strategy for neurosurgical repair following PNI.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LITENGs preserve host spinal cord motor neuron health and regenerative capacity acutely following repair of segmental nerve defects, matching that of the clinical gold-standard autograft and exceeding commercially-available nerve guidance tubes.\nC_LIO_LITENGs facilitated regeneration across segmental nerve defects, yielding similar degree of chronically surviving host spinal motor neurons and functional recovery as compared to autografts.\nC_LIO_LIEarly surgical intervention for segmental nerve defect with living scaffolds, such as TENGs and autografts, preserves the host regenerative capacity, and likely increases the ceiling for total regeneration and functional recovery at chronic time points compared to (acellular) commercially-available nerve guidance tubes.\nC_LIO_LITENGs preserve host neuronal health and regenerative capacity without sacrificing an otherwise uninjured nerve, and therefore represent a promising alternative strategy to autografts or nerve guidance tube repairs.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Since the inception of the discipline, understanding causal complexity in ecological communities has been a challenge. Here we draw insights from recent work on constraint closure that suggests ways of grappling with ecological complexity that yield generalizable theoretical insights. Using a set of evolutionary constraints on species flow through ecological communities, which include: selection, species drift, dispersal, and speciation, combined with multispecies interactions such as mutualistic interactions, and abiotic constraints, we demonstrate how constraint closure allows communities to emerge as semi-autonomous structures. Here we develop an agent-based model to explore how evolutionary constraints provide stability to ecological communities. The model is written in Netlogo, an agent based-modeling system, with advanced tools for manipulating spatially structured models and tools for tracking pattern formation. We articulate ways that ecological pattern formation, viewed through the lens of constraint closure, informs questions about stability and turnover in community ecology. The role of the chosen constraints was clear from the simulation results. It took the shape of both inducing stability and creating conditions for a more dynamic community with increases in species turnover through time. Key ecological and evolutionary variables showed overall stability in the landscape structure when plotted against the number of constraints, suggesting that these evolutionary forces act as constraints to the flow of species in such a way that constraint closure is achieved effecting semi-autonomy.\n\nAuthor SummaryEcosystems are among the most complex structures studied. They comprise elements that seem both stable and contingent. The stability of these systems depends on interactions among their evolutionary history, including the accidents of organisms moving through the landscape and microhabitats of the earth, and the biotic and abiotic conditions in which they occur. When ecosystems are stable, how is that achieved? Here we look at ecosystem stability through a computer simulation model that suggests that it may depend on what constrains the system and how those constraints are structured. Specifically, if the constraints found in an ecological community form a closed loop, that allows particular kinds of feedback may give structure to the ecosystem processes for a period of time. In this simulation model, we look at how evolutionary forces act in such a way these closed constraint loops may form. This may explain some kinds of ecosystem stability. This work will also be valuable to ecological theorists in understanding general ideas of stability in such systems.",

Using three-dimensional polyester knitting and heat fixation, trap funnels were developed with high capture efficacy, no egression under worst-case laboratory conditions, and greater durability than current bed-nets sold.

A T-Net population model was developed based on field data to predict community level mosquito control compared to a pyrethroid bed-net.

Subcortical volumes, cortical surface area and cortical thickness were assessed in MRI data of 16,683 healthy individuals 1-90 years old (47% females). We observed significant patterns of greater male than female between-subject variance for all subcortical volumetric measures, all cortical surface area measures, and 60% of cortical thickness measures. This pattern was stable across the lifespan for 50% of the subcortical structures, 70% of the regional area measures, and nearly all regions for thickness.

    "abstract": "Instinctive defensive behaviours, consisting of stereotyped sequences of movements and postures, are an essential component of the mouse behavioural repertoire. Since defensive behaviours can be reliably triggered by threatening sensory stimuli, the selection of the most appropriate action depends on the stimulus property. However, since the mouse has a wide repertoire of motor actions, it is not clear which set of movements and postures represent the relevant action. So far this has been empirically identified as a change in locomotion state. However, the extent to which locomotion alone captures the diversity of defensive behaviours and their sensory specificity is unknown.\n\nTo tackle this problem we developed a method to obtain a faithful 3D reconstruction of the mouse body that enabled to quantify a wide variety of motor actions. This higher dimensional description revealed that defensive behaviours are more stimulus-specific than indicated by locomotion data. Thus, responses to distinct stimuli that were equivalent in terms of locomotion (e.g. freezing induced by looming and sound) could be discriminated along other dimensions. The enhanced stimulus-specificity was explained by a surprising diversity. A clustering analysis revealed that distinct combinations of movements and postures, giving rise to at least 7 different behaviours, were required to account for stimulus-specificity. Moreover, each stimulus evoked more than one behaviour revealing a robust one-to-many mapping between sensations and behaviours that was not apparent from locomotion data. Our results indicate that diversity and sensory specificity of mouse defensive behaviours unfold in a higher dimensional space spanning multiple motor actions.",

Breeding and genetics studies of F. brevipila have been limited due to the complexity of its hexaploid genome. To advance our knowledge of F. brevipila genomics, we used PacBio isoform sequencing to develop a reference transcriptome for this species.\n\nResultsHere, we report the F. brevipila reference transcriptome generated from root, crown, leaf, and inflorescence tissues. We obtained 59,510 full-length transcripts, of which 38,556 were non-redundant full-length transcripts. The longest and shortest transcripts were 11,487 and 58 bp, respectively. Distribution of synonymous distances among paralogs within F. brevipila suggested highly similar subgenomes that are difficult to distinguish from sequencing errors. To evaluate the phylogenetic relationships among F. brevipila and close relatives, we sequenced three additional transcriptomes using closely related species on an Illumina platform. The results of our phylotranscriptomic analysis supported the close relationships among F. brevipila (6x), Festuca ovina (4x), Festuca ovina subsp. ovina (2x), and Festuca valesiaca (2x), with high levels of discordance among gene trees.\n\nConclusionsOverall, the F. brevipila PacBio Isoseq reference transcriptome provided the foundation for transcriptome studies and allowed breeders a resource for gene discovery in this important turfgrass species.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of repetitive DNA sequences, including satellite DNA, tandem duplications, and transposable elements, underlies phenotypic evolution and contributes to hybrid incompatibilities between species. However, repetitive genomic regions are fragmented and misassembled in most contemporary genome assemblies. We generated highly contiguous de novo reference genomes for the Drosophila simulans species complex (D. simulans, D. mauritiana, and D. sechellia), which speciated [~]250,000 years ago. Our assemblies are comparable in contiguity and accuracy to the current D. melanogaster genome, allowing us to directly compare repetitive sequences between these four species. We find that at least 15% of the D. simulans complex species genomes fail to align uniquely to D. melanogaster due to structural divergence--twice the number of single-nucleotide substitutions. We also find rapid turnover of satellite DNA and extensive structural divergence in heterochromatic regions, while the euchromatic gene content is mostly conserved. Despite the overall preservation of gene synteny, euchromatin in each species has been shaped by clade and species-specific inversions, transposable elements, expansions and contractions of satellite and tRNA tandem arrays, and gene duplications. We also find rapid divergence among Y-linked genes, including copy number variation and recent gene duplications from autosomes. Our assemblies provide a valuable resource for studying genome evolution and its consequences for phenotypic evolution in these genetic model species.",

    "abstract": "Current deep learning methods for structure-based virtual screening take the structures of both the protein and the ligand as input but make little or no use of the protein structure when predicting ligand binding. Here we show how a relatively simple method of dataset augmentation forces such deep learning methods to take into account information from the protein. Models trained in this way are more generalisable (make better predictions on protein-ligand complexes from a different distribution to the training data). They also assign more meaningful importance to the protein and ligand atoms involved in binding. Overall, our results show that dataset augmentation can help deep learning based virtual screening to learn physical interactions rather than dataset biases.\n\nGraphical TOC Entry\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/979625v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@609f5forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17f2cbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@51e854org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16c111f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Palms are conspicuous floristic elements across the tropics. In continental Africa, even though there are less than 70 documented species, they are omnipresent across the tropical landscape. The genus Raphia has 20 accepted species in Africa and one species endemic to the Neotropics. It is the most economically important genus of African palms with most of its species producing food and construction material. Raphia is divided into five sections based on inflorescence morphology. Nevertheless, the taxonomy of Raphia is problematic with no intra-generic phylogenetic study available. We present a phylogenetic study of the genus using a targeted exon capture approach sequencing of 56 individuals representing 18 out of the 21 species. Our results recovered five well supported clades within the genus. Three sections correspond to those based on inflorescence morphology. R. regalis is strongly supported as sister to all other Raphia species and is placed into a newly described section: Erectae. Overall, morphological based identifications agreed well with our phylogenetic analyses, with 12 species recovered as monophyletic based on our sampling. Species delimitation analyses recovered 17 or 23 species depending on the confidence level used. Species delimitation is especially problematic in the Raphiate and Temulentae sections. In addition, our clustering analysis using SNP data suggested that individual clusters matched geographic distribution. The Neotropical species R. taedigera is supported as a distinct species, rejecting the hypothesis of a recent introduction into South America. Our analyses support the hypothesis that the Raphia individuals from Madagascar are potentially a distinct species different from the widely distributed R. farinifera. In conclusion, our results support the infra generic classification of Raphia based on inflorescence morphology, which is shown to be phylogenetically useful. Classification and species delimitation within sections remains problematic even with our phylogenomic approach. Certain widely distributed species could potentially contain cryptic species. More in-depth studies should be undertaken using morphometrics, increased sampling and more variable markers. Our study provides a robust phylogenomic framework that enables further investigation on the biogeographic history, morphological evolution and other eco-evolutionary aspects of this charismatic, socially and economically important palm genus.",

However, their pathogenesis remains poorly understood due in part to a lack of tractable animal models. We have developed an inducible model of focal heterotopia that enables their precise spatiotemporal control and high-resolution optical imaging in live mice. Here we report that heterotopia are associated with striking patterns of hypermyelinated and circumferentially projecting axons around neuronal clusters. Despite their aberrant axonal patterns, in vivo calcium imaging revealed that heterotopic neurons remain functionally connected to other brain regions, highlighting their potential to influence global neural networks. These aberrant patterns only form when heterotopia are induced during a critical embryonic temporal window, but not in early postnatal development. Our model provides a new way to investigate heterotopia formation in vivo and revealed features suggesting the existence of developmentally-modulated, neuron-derived axon guidance and myelination factors.",

The knowledge of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as SARS-CoV, can reveal the common and/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system.\n\nHerein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibody-binding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of RBDs in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. Importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind/elicit antibodies. These results provide a rational basis to the observation that several SARS-CoV RDB-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. Furthermore, we correctly identify the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is engaged by the cell receptor ACE2 during viral entry into host cells.\n\nThe data, sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.",

Utilizing two complementary sequencing techniques, we here present a high-resolution map of the SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome. DNA nanoball sequencing shows that the transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical. In addition to the genomic RNA and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces a large number of transcripts encoding unknown ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift. Using nanopore direct RNA sequencing, we further find at least 41 RNA modification sites on viral transcripts, with the most frequent motif being AAGAA. Modified RNAs have shorter poly(A) tails than unmodified RNAs, suggesting a link between the internal modification and the 3' tail. Functional investigation of the unknown ORFs and RNA modifications discovered in this study will open new directions to our understanding of the life cycle and pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe provide a high-resolution map of SARS-CoV-2 transcriptome and epitranscriptome using nanopore direct RNA sequencing and DNA nanoball sequencing.\nC_LIO_LIThe transcriptome is highly complex owing to numerous recombination events, both canonical and noncanonical.\nC_LIO_LIIn addition to the genomic and subgenomic RNAs common in all coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 produces transcripts encoding unknown ORFs.\nC_LIO_LIWe discover at least 41 potential RNA modification sites with an AAGAA motif.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The tRNA pool determines the efficiency, throughput, and accuracy of translation. Previous studies have identified dynamic changes in the tRNA supply and mRNA demand during cancerous proliferation. Yet, dynamic changes may occur also during physiologically normal proliferation, and these are less characterized. We examined the tRNA and mRNA pools of T-cells during their vigorous proliferation and differentiation upon triggering their antigen receptor. We observe a global signature of switch in demand for codons at the early proliferation phase of the response, accompanied by corresponding changes in tRNA expression levels. In the later phase, upon differentiation, the response of the tRNA pool is relaxed back to basal level, potentially restraining excessive proliferation. Sequencing of tRNAs allowed us to also evaluate their diverse base-modifications. We found that two types of tRNA modifications, wybutosine and ms2t6A, are reduced dramatically during T-cell activation. These modifications occur in the anti-codon loops of two tRNAs that decode \"slippery codons\", that are prone to ribosomal frameshifting. Attenuation of these frameshift-protective modifications is expected to increase the potential for proteome-wide frameshifting during T-cell proliferation. Indeed, human cell lines deleted of a wybutosine writer showed increased ribosomal frameshifting, as detected with a HIV gag-pol frameshifting site reporter. These results may explain HIVs specific tropism towards proliferating T-Cells since it requires ribosomal frameshift exactly on the corresponding codon for infection. The changes in tRNA expression and modifications uncover a new layer of translation regulation during T-cell proliferation and exposes a potential trade-off between cellular growth and translation fidelity.\n\nSignificance statementThe tRNA pool decodes genetic information during translation. As such, it is subject to intricate physiological regulation in all species, across different physiological conditions. Here we show for the first time a program that governs the tRNA pool and its interaction with the transcriptome upon a physiological cellular proliferation- T-cells activation. We found that upon antigenic activation of T-cells, their tRNA and mRNA pools undergo coordinated and complementary changes, which are relaxed when cells reduce back their proliferation rate and differentiate into memory cells. We found a reduction in two particular tRNA modifications that have a role in governing translation fidelity and frameshift prevention. This exposes a vulnerability in activated T-cells that may be utilized by HIV for its replication.\n\nClassificationBIOLOGICAL SCIENCES; cell biology",

Macrophages in the tumor microenvironment are important and multifaceted components in actively sustaining tumor progression but also in clearance of tumor cells and play an important role in the outcome of chemotherapy. Here, we report that post neo-adjuvant chemotherapy macrophages in tumor samples display elevated expression of the immune checkpoint PD-L1. We determined that chemotherapy or direct application of DNA damage to macrophages in vitro triggers a specific MDDR polarization phenotype characterized by increased phagocytic activity, elevated PD-L1 expression, and induction of endotoxin tolerance. Phospho-proteomics analysis revealed epigenetic alterations and ATM-dependent induction of senescence in macrophages upon DNA damage. We propose that ATM-induced senescence and PD-L1 immune checkpoint induction mediate a specific MDDR macrophage polarization that might contribute to chemotherapy responses. Furthermore, our results clarify the functional role of tumor associated macrophages in the context of DNA damage and combination therapies including checkpoint inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic IgG4 autoantibodies in autoimmune myasthenia gravis (MG) are functionally monovalent as a result of Fab-arm exchange. The origin and development of these unique autoantibodies are not well understood. We examined MG patient-derived monoclonal autoantibodies (mAbs), their corresponding germline-encoded unmutated common ancestors (UCA) and monovalent antigen-binding fragments (Fabs) to investigate how antigen-driven affinity maturation contributes to both binding and immunopathology. Mature mAbs, their UCA counterparts and mature monovalent Fabs bound to the autoantigen and retained their pathogenic capacity. However, monovalent UCA Fabs still bound the autoantigen but lost their pathogenic capacity. The mature Fabs were characterized by very high affinity (sub-nanomolar) driven by a rapid on-rate and slow off-rate. However, the UCA affinity was approximately 100-fold less than that of the mature Fabs, which was driven by a rapid off-rate. Crystal structures of two Fabs shed light on how mutations acquired during affinity maturation may contribute to increased MuSK binding affinity. These collective findings indicate that the autoantigen initiates the autoimmune response in MuSK MG and drives autoimmunity through the accumulation of somatic hypermutation such that monovalent IgG4 Fab-arm exchanged MG autoantibodies reach a high affinity threshold required for pathogenic capacity.\n\nSummaryIgG4 autoantibodies in autoimmune myasthenia gravis are functionally monovalent, requiring a high affinity threshold featuring fast on/slow off rates, to reach pathogenic capacity. This capacity is dependent on self-antigen initiated and driven maturation, which includes the accumulation of indispensable somatic hypermutations that may alter electrostatic interactions with the antigen.",

During the last few years, third generation sequencing technologies have enabled researchers to sequence much longer molecules, but at the expense of sequencing accuracy. Thus, new algorithms needed to be developed to cope with this new type of data. With this in mind, we developed a tool called MetaG. An intuitive web interface makes the software accessible to a vast range of users, including those without extensive bioinformatic expertise. Evaluation of MetaGs performance showed that it makes nearly perfect classifications of viral isolates using simulated short and long reads. MetaG also outperformed current state-of-the-art algorithms on data from targeted sequencing of the 16S and 28S rRNA genes. Since MetaGs output is also supplemented with information about hosts and antibiotic resistances of pathogens, we expect it to be especially useful to the healthcare sector. Moreover, the outstanding accuracy of the taxonomic assignments will make MetaG a serious alternative for anyone working with metagenomic sequences.

    "abstract": "In shotgun proteomics, it is essential to accurately determine the proteolytic products of each protein in the sample for subsequent identification and quantification, because these proteolytic products are usually taken as the surrogates of their parent proteins in the further data analysis. However, systematical studies about the commonly used proteases in proteomics research are insufficient, and there is a lack of easy-to-use tools to predict the digestibilities of these proteolytic products. Here, we propose a novel sequence-based deep learning model - DeepDigest, which integrates convolutional neural networks and long-short term memory networks for digestibility prediction of peptides. DeepDigest can predict the proteolytic cleavage sites for eight popular proteases including trypsin, ArgC, chymotrypsin, GluC, LysC, AspN, LysN and LysargiNase. Compared with traditional machine learning algorithms, DeepDigest showed superior performance for all the eight proteases on a variety of datasets. Besides, some interesting characteristics of different proteases were revealed and discussed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrecision medicine approaches aim to tackle diseases on an individual level through molecular profiling. Despite the growing knowledge about diseases and the reported diversity of molecular phenotypes, the descriptions of human health on an individual level have been far less elaborate.\n\nMethodsTo provide insights into the longitudinal protein signatures of well-being, we profiled blood plasma collected over one year from 101 clinically healthy individuals using multiplexed antibody assays. After applying an antibody validation scheme, we utilized > 700 protein profiles for in-depth analyses of the individuals short-term health trajectories.\n\nFindingsWe found signatures of circulating proteomes to be highly individual-specific. Considering technical and longitudinal variability, we observed both stable and fluctuating proteins in the circulation, as well as networks of proteins that covaried over time. For each participant, there were unique protein profiles and some of these could be explained by associations to genetic variants.\n\nInterpretationThis study demonstrates that there was noticeable diversity among clinically healthy subjects, and facets of individual-specific signatures emerged by monitoring the variability of the circulating proteomes over time. Longitudinal profiling of circulating proteomes has the potential to enable a more personal hence precise assessment of health states, and thereby provide a valuable component of precision medicine approaches.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the Erling Persson Foundation for the KTH Centre for Precision Medicine and the Swedish Heart and Lung Foundation for the SCAPIS project.

    "abstract": "Natural control of crop pests has the potential to complement or replace intensive agricultural practices, but its mainstream application requires reliable predictions in diverse socioecological settings. In lack of a widely accepted model of natural pest control, we review existing modelling approaches and critically examine their potential to provide understanding and predictions across agricultural landscapes. Models that explicitly represent the underlying mechanisms are better positioned to represent the diversity and context sensitivity of natural pest control than correlative models. Such mechanistic models have used diverse techniques to represent crop-pest-enemy combinations at various spatiotemporal scales. However, certain regions of the world and socioeconomic aspects of natural pest control are underrepresented, while modelling approaches are restricted by a fundamental trade-off between generality and realism. We propose that modelling natural pest control across agroecosystems requires a framework of context-specific generalizations, based on empirical evidence and theoretical expectations. Reviewed models of natural pest control indicate potential attributes of such a general predictive framework.",

    "abstract": "Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy (GLD, or Krabbe disease) is a rare lysosomal storage disease caused by inherited deficiency of {beta}-galactocerebrosidase (GALC). The build-up of galactosylsphingosine (psychosine) and other undegraded galactosylsphingolipids in the nervous system causes severe demyelination and neurodegeneration. The molecular mechanisms of GLD are poorly elucidated in neural cells and whether murine systems recapitulate critical aspects of the human disease is still to be defined.\n\nHere, we established a collection of GLD patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. We differentiated iPSCs from two patients (bearing different disease-causing mutations) into neural progenitors cells (NPCs) and their neuronal/glial progeny, assessing the impact of GALC deficiency and lentiviral vector-mediated GALC rescue/overexpression by means of phenotypic, biochemical, molecular, and lipidomic analysis. We show a progressive increase of psychosine during the differentiation of GLD NPCs to neurons and glia. We report an early and persistent impairment of oligodendroglial and neuronal differentiation in GLD cultures, with peculiar differences observed in the two GLD lines. GLD cells display a global unbalance of lipid composition during the iPSC to neural differentiation and early activation of cellular senescence, depending on the disease-causing mutation. Restoration of GALC activity normalizes the primary pathological hallmarks and partially rescues the differentiation program of GLD NPCs.\n\nOur results suggest that multiple mechanisms besides psychosine toxicity concur to CNS pathology in GLD and highlight the need of a timely regulated GALC expression for proper lineage commitment and differentiation of human NPCs. These findings have important implications for establishing tailored gene therapy strategies to enhance disease correction in GLD.",

To accelerate our understanding of cis-regulatory code embedded in 5UTR, we devised massively parallel reporter assays from a synthetic mRNA library composed of over one million 5UTR variants. A completely randomized 10-nucleotide sequence preceding an upstream open reading frame (uORF) and downstream GFP leads to a broad range of mRNA translatability and stability in mammalian cells. While efficient translation protects mRNA from degradation, uORF translation triggers mRNA decay in a UPF1-dependent manner. We also identified translational inhibitory elements in 5UTR with G-quadruplex as a mark for mRNA decay in the P-body. Unexpectedly, an unstructured A-rich element in 5UTR, while enabling cap-independent translation, destabilizes mRNAs in the absence of translation. Our results not only expose diverse sequence features of 5UTR in controlling mRNA translatability, but also reveal ribosome-dependent and -independent mRNA surveillance pathways.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian species, the first days after birth are an important period for survival and the rates of mortality before weaning are high. In pigs, the perinatal deaths average 20% of the litter, with important economic and societal consequences. Among the factors influencing piglet survival at birth, the maturity is likely to be one of the most important. Maturity can be defined as the outcome of complex mechanisms of intra-uterine development and maturation occurring during the last month of gestation. Here, we provide new insights on maturity by studying the end of gestation at two different stages (three weeks before term and close to term) in two breeds of pigs that strongly differ in terms of neonatal survival. Since metabolomics is a promising approach for phenotype characterization or biomarker discovery, we provide a complete understanding of the metabolome of the fetuses in late gestation in three fluids (plasma, urine, and amniotic fluid). We found that biological processes related to amino acid and carbohy-drate metabolisms are critical for piglet maturity. We also confirmed some previously described metabolites associated with delayed growth (e.g., proline and myo-inositol). Altogether, our study proposes new routes for a better characterization of piglet maturity at birth.",

Several strategies were tested to determine their effect on chitosan mediated transfection efficiency: co-administration with polyplexes, co-complexation at the time of polyplex formation, and covalent ligation to chitosan.

These peptides are cyclized through thioether crosslinks and can bear other secondary post-translational modifications. While lanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters can be identified by the presence of characteristic enzymes involved in the post-translational modification of these peptides, locating the precursor peptides encoded within these clusters is challenging due to their short length and high sequence variability, which limits the high-throughput exploration of lanthipeptide precursor peptides. To address this challenge, we enhanced the predictive capabilities of Rapid ORF Description & Evaluation Online (RODEO) to identify all known classes of lanthipeptides.\n\nResultsUsing RODEO, we mined over 100,000 bacterial and archaeal genomes in the RefSeq database. We identified nearly 8,500 lanthipeptide precursor peptides. These precursor peptides were identified in a broad range of bacterial phyla as well as the Euryarchaeota phylum of archaea. Bacteroidetes were found to encode a large number of these biosynthetic gene clusters, despite making up a relatively small portion of the genomes in this dataset. While a number of these precursor peptides are similar to those of previously characterized lanthipeptides, even more were not, including potential antibiotics. Additionally, examination of the biosynthetic gene clusters revealed enzymes that install secondary post-translational modifications are more widespread than initially thought.\n\nConclusionLanthipeptide biosynthetic gene clusters are more widely distributed and the precursor peptides encoded within these clusters are more diverse than previously appreciated, demonstrating that the lanthipeptide sequence-function space remains largely underexplored.",

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphThe Siberian Altai mountains have been intermittently occupied by both Neandertals and Denisovans, two extinct hominin groups1,2. While they diverged at least 390,000 years ago3,4, later contacts lead to gene flow from Neandertals into Denisovans5,6. Using a new population genetic method that is capable of inferring signatures of admixture from highly degraded genetic data, I show that this gene flow was much more widespread than previously thought. While the two earliest Denisovans both have substantial and recent Neandertal ancestry, I find signatures of admixture in all archaic genomes from the Altai, demonstrating that gene flow also occurred from Denisovans into Neandertals. This suggests that a contact zone between Neandertals and Denisovan populations persisted in the Altai region throughout much of the Middle Paleolithic. In contrast, Western Eurasian Neandertals have little to no Denisovan ancestry. As I find no evidence of natural selection against gene flow, this suggests that neutral demographic processes and geographic isolation were likely major drivers of human differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The probability that a propagule reaches a certain location where it can establish and persist is affected by the distance from the source. Fragmented landscapes often promote the isolation of habitats that hinder or impede the movement of species that affect their range distribution, even when environmental conditions are adequate. Studies that assess the connectivity of the landscape are essential to ensure that ecological conservation planning covers all vital processes that occur on a landscape scale. Based on the classification of land cover in the Rio Doce Basin - RDB, we used a habitat / non-habitat approach to assess RDB connectivity for tree species. Based on circuit theory, we built 6 surface models of resistance based on habitat and non-habitat areas. We performed the analysis using the GIS plug-in and Linkage Mapper to generate lest cost path maps. The RDB is very fragmented, but still has functionally connected regions. The west to nothwestern and southeastern portions of the basin are well-connected and demand conservation practices, while the center-north of the basin and the far southwest are regions with greater resistance to connectivity as a result of strong anthropic pressures that reduce forests, requiring intervention through restoration projects avoiding loss due to lack of connectivity. In addition, land reclamation projects in degraded areas must also be organized in the Linhares region, as it is inserted in a region of very high biodiversity with a high level of endemism and a high number of threatened species.",

    "abstract": "Caloric restriction (CR) is widely known to increase life span and resistance against different types of injuries in several organisms. We have previously shown that mitochondria from livers or brains of CR animals exhibit higher calcium uptake rates and lower sensitivity to calcium-induced mitochondrial permeability transition (mPT), an event related to the resilient phenotype exhibited by these organs. Given the importance of calcium in metabolic control and cell homeostasis, we aimed here to uncover possible changes in mitochondrial calcium handling, redox balance and bioenergetics in cardiac and skeletal muscle mitochondria. Unexpectedly, we found that CR does not alter the susceptibility to mPT in muscle (cardiac or skeletal), nor calcium uptake rates. Despite the lack in changes in calcium transport properties, CR consistently decreased respiration in the presence of ATP synthesis in heart and soleus muscle. In heart, such changes were accompanied by a decrease in respiration in the absence of ATP synthesis, lower maximal respiratory rates and a reduced rate of hydrogen peroxide release. Hydrogen peroxide release was unaltered by CR in skeletal muscle. No changes were observed in inner membrane potentials and respiratory control ratios. Together, these results highlight the tissue-specific bioenergetic and ion transport effects induced by CR, demonstrating that resilience against calcium-induced mPT is not present in all tissues.",

    "abstract": "While changes in nuclear structure and organization are frequently observed in cancer cells, relatively little is known about how nuclear architecture impacts cancer progression and pathology. To begin to address this question, we studied Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2) because its levels decrease during melanoma progression. We show that increasing NTF2 expression in metastatic melanoma cells reduces cell proliferation and motility while increasing apoptosis. We also demonstrate that increasing NTF2 expression in these cells significantly inhibits metastasis and increases survival of mice. Mechanistically, we show that NTF2 levels affect the expression and nuclear positioning of a number of genes associated with cell proliferation and migration. We propose that by decreasing nuclear size and/or lamin A nuclear localization, ectopic expression of NTF2 in metastatic melanoma alters chromatin organization to generate a gene expression profile with characteristics of primary melanoma, concomitantly abrogating several phenotypes associated with advanced stage cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Thus NTF2 acts as a melanoma tumor suppressor to maintain proper nuclear structure and gene expression and could be a novel therapeutic target to improve health outcomes of melanoma patients.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin is the complex assembly of nucleic acids and proteins that makes up the physiological form of the eukaryotic genome. The nucleosome is the fundamental repeating unit of chromatin, composed of ~147bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer formed by two copies of each core histone: H2A, H2B, H3 and H4. Prior to nucleosome assembly, and during histone eviction, histones are typically assembled into soluble H2A/H2B dimers and H3/H4 dimers and tetramers. A multitude of factors interact with soluble histone dimers and tetramers, including chaperones, importins, histone modifying enzymes, and chromatin remodeling enzymes. It is still unclear how many of these proteins recognize soluble histones; therefore, there is a need for new structural tools to study non-nucleosomal histones. Here we created a single-chain, tailless Xenopus H2A/H2B dimer by directly fusing the C-terminus of H2B to the N-terminus of H2A. We show that this construct (termed scH2BH2A) is readily expressed in bacteria and can be purified under non-denaturing conditions. A 1.31[A] crystal structure of scH2BH2A shows that it adopts a conformation nearly identical to nucleosomal H2A/H2B. This new tool will facilitate future structural studies of a multitude of H2A/H2B-interacting proteins.",

These methods reduce the need for time-consuming manual annotations for supervised datasets, potentially reduce the costs in high-throughput imaging screens, and open up a number of potentially novel analyses. However as with any prediction there can be sources of error and uncertainty. Here we present BFNet, a method to visualise the uncertainty in predicted images by applying Monte Carlo dropout during inference and calculating per-pixel variance as an uncertainty map. Our method demonstrates the ability to highlight regions of an image where prediction is difficult or impossible due to imaging artefacts such as occlusions or out-of-focus images, as well as more general uncertainty when a trained model is applied to new data from different imaging of experimental settings.

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome mapping is an essential step in data processing for transcriptome analysis, and many previous studies have evaluated various methods and strategies for mapping RNA-seq data. Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) is a sequencing-based protocol particularly designed to capture the 5{square}-ends of transcripts for quantitatively measuring the expression levels of transcription start sites genome-wide. Because CAGE analysis can also predict the activities of promoters and enhancers, this protocol has been an essential tool in studies of transcriptional regulation. Typically, the same mapping software is used to align both RNA-seq data and CAGE reads to a reference genome, but which mapping software and options are most appropriate for mapping the 5{square}-end sequence reads obtained through CAGE has not previously been evaluated systematically.\n\nResultsHere we assessed various strategies for aligning CAGE reads, particularly [~]50-bp sequences, with the human genome by using the HISAT2, LAST, and STAR programs both with and without a reference transcriptome. One of the major inconsistencies among the tested strategies involves alignments to pseudogenes and parent genes: some of the strategies prioritized alignments with pseudogenes even when the read could be aligned with coding genes with fewer mismatches. Another inconsistency concerned the detection of exon-exon junctions. These preferences depended on the program applied and whether a reference transcriptome was included. Overall, the choice of strategy yielded different mapping results for approximately 2% of all promoters.\n\nConclusionsAlthough the various alignment strategies produced very similar results overall, we noted several important and measurable differences. In particular, using the reference transcriptome in STAR yielded alignments with the fewest mismatches. In addition, the inconsistencies among the strategies were especially noticeable regarding alignments to pseudogenes and novel splice junctions. Our results indicate that the choice of alignment strategy is important because it might affect the biological interpretation of the data.",

    "abstract": "New strategies that enable fast and accurate visualization of Candida biofilms are necessary to better study their structure and response to antifungals agents. Here, we applied whole slide imaging (WSI) to study biofilm formation of Candida species. Three relevant biofilm-forming Candida species (C. albicans ATCC 10231, C. glabrata ATCC 2001, and C. tropicalis ATCC 750) were cultivated on glass coverslips both in presence and absence of widely used antifungals. Accumulated biofilms were stained with fluorescent markers and scanned in both bright-field and fluorescence modes using a WSI digital scanner. WSI enabled clear assessment of both size and structural features of Candida biofilms. Quantitative analyses readily detected reductions in biofilm-covered surface area upon antifungal exposure. Furthermore, we show that the overall biofilm growth can be adequately assessed across both bright-field and fluorescence modes. At the single-cell level, WSI proved adequate, as morphometric parameters evaluated with WSI did not differ significantly from those obtained with scanning electron microscopy, considered as golden standard at single-cell resolution. Thus, WSI allows for reliable visualization of Candida biofilms enabling both large-scale growth assessment and morphometric characterization of single-cell features, making it an important addition to the available microscopic toolset to image and analyze fungal biofilm growth.",

Fishers exact test was used to compare the prevalence of B. quintana detection in civil and military populations. B. quintana DNA was confirmed in a total of 28/145 (19.3%) individuals, comprising 78 citizens and 67 soldiers, 20.1% and 17.9% of which were positive for B. quintana bacteremia, respectively. This study collected previous studies on these ancient samples and showed that the presence of B. quintana infection followed the course of time in human history; a total of 14/15 sites from five European countries had a positive prevalence. The positive rate in soldiers was higher than those of citizens, with 20% and 18.8%, respectively, in the 18th - 19th centuries, but the difference in frequency was not significant. These results confirmed the role of dental pulp in diagnosing B. quintana bacteremia in ancient populations and showed the incidence of B. quintana in both citizens and soldiers.

    "abstract": "The ciprofloxacin-modifying crpP gene was recently identified in a plasmid isolated from a clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolate. Homologues of this gene were also identified in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. We set out to explore the mobile genetic elements involved in the acquisition and spread of this gene in publicly available and complete genomes of Pseudomonas. The crpP gene was identified only in P. aeruginosa, in more than half of the complete chromosomes (61.9%, n=133/215) belonging to 52 sequence types, of which the high-risk clone ST111 was the most frequent. We identified 136 crpP-harboring ICEs, with 93.4% belonging to the mating-pair formation G (MPFG) family. The ICEs were integrated at the end of a tRNALys gene and were all flanked by highly conserved 45-bp direct repeats. The core ICEome contains 26 genes (2.2% of all genes), which are present in 99% or more of the crpP-harboring ICEs. The most frequently encoded traits on these ICEs include replication, transcription, intracellular trafficking and cell motility. Our work reveals that ICEs are the main vectors promoting the dissemination of the ciprofloxacin-modifying crpP gene in P. aeruginosa.\n\nAuthor NotesAll supporting data has been provided within the article or through supplementary data files. Supplementary material is available with the online version of this article.\n\nImpact StatementA high proportion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates are resistant to ciprofloxacin. Resistance to this antibiotic is often mediated by chromosomal mutations, but recently horizontally transferred genes have been identified. We assessed the repartition of the ciprofloxacin-modifying crpP gene among Pseudomonas genomes and we characterized the mobile elements associated with its acquisition. We found that this gene is prevalent in P. aeruginosa and frequently associated with integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). Importantly, we also identified highly conserved direct repeats that can be used to accurately delimit crpP-carrying ICEs in P. aeruginosa genomes.\n\nData SummaryAll the bacterial genomes scanned in this study have been deposited previously in the National Center for Biotechnology Information genome database and are listed on the supplementary tables.

While certain prokaryote phyla were influenced by cropping system (e.g. Acidobacteria), the community as a whole was primarily driven by temporal changes over the growing season as distinct overwinter and crop-associated communities, with the same trend observed regardless of cropping system. Species- rich prokaryote communities were most stable over the growing season. Cropping system exerted a greater effect on fungal communities, with alpha-diversity highest and temporal changes most stable under CA. CON was particularly detrimental for alpha-diversity in AMF communities, with AMF alpha-diversity and stability improved under all other cropping systems. Practices that promoted alpha-diversity tended to also increase the similarity and temporal stability of soil fungal (and AMF) communities during a growing season, while prokaryote communities were largely insensitive to management.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages (phages), or bacterial viruses, are very diverse and highly abundant worldwide, including human microbiomes. Although a few metagenomic studies have focused on oral phages, they relied on short-read sequencing. Here, we conducted a long-read metagenomic study of human saliva for the first time using PromethION that requires a smaller amount of DNA than PacBio. Our analyses, which integrated both PromethION and HiSeq data of >30 Gb per sample, revealed N50 ranging from 187-345 kb and thousands of contigs with >1 kb accounting for > 99% of all contigs on which 94-96% of HiSeq reads were mapped. We identified hundreds of viral contigs (95 phages and 333 prophages on an average per sample); 0-43.8% and 12.5-56.3% of the \"most confident\" phages and prophages, respectively, didnt cluster with those reported previously and were identified as novel. Our integrated analyses identified highly abundant oral phages/prophages, including a novel Streptococcus phage cluster and nine jumbo phages/prophages. Interestingly, 86% of the phage cluster and 67% of the jumbo phages/prophages contained remote homologs of antimicrobial resistance genes, suggesting their potential role as a source of recombination to generate new resistance genes. Pan-genome analysis of the phages/prophages revealed remarkable diversity, identifying 0.3% and 86.4% of the genes as core and singletons, respectively. Functional annotation revealed that the highest fraction of the core genes was enriched in phage morphogenesis, followed by the fraction enriched in host cellular processes. Furthermore, our study suggested that oral phages present in human saliva are under selective pressure for escaping CRISPR immunity.\n\nImportanceDespite the abundance and grave implications oral bacterial viruses in health and disease, little is known regarding the different groups of oral bacterial viruses, their relative abundances under various conditions, and their activities. We provided answers to these questions for the first time utilizing a recently developed sequencer that can capture and sequence long DNA fragments, including viruses, and requires only a small amount of DNA input, making it suitable for analyzing human oral samples. We identified hundreds of viral sequences, including \"jumbo\" viruses and a distinctive group of highly abundant oral viruses, which often contained parts of antimicrobial resistance genes; the entire repertoire of these viral genes showed remarkable diversity and supported a recently proposed hypothesis that phages modulate oral microbiota through multiple mechanisms. We also revealed genomic signs of coevolution of viruses and host bacteria that have been missed in large viromic studies in humans.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecium is one of the leading pathogens in the world. In this study, we proposed a strategy to rapidly and accurately distinguish vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) and vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium (VSEfm) to help doctors correctly determine the use of vancomycin by a machine learning (ML)-based algorithm. A predictive model was developed and validated to distinguish VREfm and VSEfm by analyzing MALDI-TOF MS spectra of unique E. faecium isolates from different specimen types. Firstly, 5717 mass spectra, including 2795 VREfm and 2922 VSEfm, were used to develop the algorithm. And 2280 mass spectra of isolates, namely 1222 VREfm and 1058 VSEfm, were used to externally validate the algorithm. The random forest-based algorithm demonstrated good classification performances for overall specimens, whose mean AUROC in 5-fold cross validation, time-wise validation, and external validation was all greater than 0.84. For the detection of VREfm in blood, sterile body fluid, urinary tract, and wound, the AUROC in external validation was also greater than 0.84. The predictions with algorithms were significantly more accurate than empirical antibiotic use. The accuracy of antibiotics administration could be improved by 30%. And the algorithm could provide rapid antibiotic susceptibility results at least 24 hours ahead of routine laboratory tests. The turn-around-time of antibiotic susceptibility could be reduced by 50%. In conclusion, a ML algorithm using MALDI-TOF MS spectra obtained in routine workflow accurately differentiated VREfm from VSEfm, especially in blood and sterile body fluid, which can be applied to facilitate the clinical testing process due to its accuracy, generalizability, and rapidness.",

    "abstract": "Eight RNA helicases remodel the spliceosome to effect pre-mRNA splicing but their mechanism of action remains poorly understood. We have developed \"purified spliceosome iCLIP\" (psiCLIP) to define helicase-RNA contacts in specific spliceosomal states. psiCLIP reveals previously unappreciated dynamics of spliceosomal helicases. The binding profile of the helicase Prp16 is influenced by the distance between the branch-point and 3 splice site, while Prp22 binds diffusely on the intron before exon ligation but switches to more narrow binding downstream of the exon junction after exon ligation. Notably, depletion of the exon-ligation factor Prp18 destabilizes Prp22 binding to the pre-mRNA, demonstrating that psiCLIP can be used to study the relationships between helicases and auxiliary splicing factors. Thus, psiCLIP is sensitive to spliceosome dynamics and complements the insights from structural and imaging studies by providing crucial positional information on helicase-RNA contacts during spliceosomal remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) propagate tau pathology for Alzheimers disease (AD). How EV transmission influences AD are, nonetheless, poorly understood. To these ends, the physicochemical and molecular structure-function relationships of human brain-derived EVs, from AD and prodromal AD (pAD), were compared to non-demented controls (CTRL). AD EVs were shown to be significantly enriched in epitope-specific tau oligomers versus pAD or CTRL EVs assayed by dot-blot and atomic force microscopy tests. AD EVs were efficiently internalized by murine cortical neurons and transferred tau with higher aggregation potency than pAD and CTRL EVs. Strikingly, inoculation of tau-containing AD EVs into the outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus induced tau propagation throughout the hippocampus. This was seen in 22 months-old C57BL/6 mice at 4.5 months post-injection by semiquantitative brain-wide immunohistochemistry tests with multiple anti-phospho-tau (p-tau) antibodies. Inoculation of the equal amount of tau from CTRL EVs or as oligomer or fibril-enriched fraction from the same AD donor showed little propagation. AD EVs induced tau accumulation in the hippocampus as oligomers or sarkosyl-insoluble proteins. Unexpectedly, p-tau cells were mostly GAD67+ GABAergic neurons and to a lesser extent, GluR2/3+ excitatory mossy cells, showing preferential EV-mediated GABAergic neuronal tau propagation. Whole-cell patch clamp recording of Cornu Ammonis (CA1) pyramidal cells showed significant reduction in the amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents. This was accompanied by reductions in c-fos+ GAD67+GABAergic neurons and GAD67+ GABAergic neuronal puncta surrounding pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region confirming reduced interneuronal projections.

    "abstract": "Attention Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has been intensively studied in neurodevelopmental research, with the aim to identify the neural substrates of the disorder. Prior studies have established that brain oscillations in specific frequency ranges associated with attention and motor tasks are altered in ADHD patients as compared to typically developing (TD) peers. We hypothesized that the behavioral improvement following medication in ADHD patients should be accompanied by a normalization in the modulation of such oscillations. We hence implemented a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design, where boys diagnosed with ADHD underwent behavioral and MEG measurements during a spatial attention task while on and off stimulant medication (methylphenidate, MPH). Results were compared with an age/IQ-matched TD group performing the same task, to assess the effect of MPH on oscillatory activity in the alpha (7 - 13Hz) and beta (15 - 30Hz) bands. We observed that depression of beta band oscillation over motor cortex in preparation to the response in ADHD boys on placebo were significantly lower as compared to the TD group. Importantly MPH resulted in a normalization of the beta depression, which then reached the same levels as in the control subjects. Furthermore, alpha power increased during the preparation interval in the ADHD control group, supposedly reflecting working memory maintenance of the cue information. This increase was significantly reduced in the ADHD group on MPH, reflecting a reduced impact on working memory load. This is the first MEG study showing task related changes in brain oscillations with MPH in children with ADHD.\n\nSignificance statementBrain oscillations in the alpha (7-13Hz) and beta (15-30Hz) frequency bands are thought to underly different aspects of attentional processing and their aberrant modulation has been reported in ADHD. Here, we used a child-friendly adaptation of a Posner cueing paradigm to investigate such oscillations in children with and without a diagnosis of ADHD, and further examined the effects of methylphenidate (MPH) in the latter group. We showed that MPH restores aberrant patterns of beta desynchronization and reduces alpha power during retention in the ADHD group, concomitant to an improvement in behavioural performance.",

    "abstract": "Hemodynamic activity in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) correlates with conflict, suggesting it contributes to conflict processing. This correlation could be explained by multiple neural processes that can be disambiguated by population firing rates patterns. We used targeted dimensionality reduction to characterize activity of populations of single dACC neurons as humans performed a task that manipulates two forms of conflict. Although conflict enhanced firing rates, this enhancement did not come from a discrete population of domain-general conflict-encoding neurons, nor from a distinct conflict-encoding response axis. Nor was it the epiphenomenal consequence of simultaneous coactivation of action plans. Instead, conflict amplified the task-relevant information encoded across the neuronal population. Effects of conflict were weaker and more heterogeneous in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), suggesting that dACCs role in conflict processing may be somewhat specialized. Overall, these results support the theory that conflict biases competition between sensorimotor transformation processes occurring in dACC.",

    "abstract": "The commonly accepted \"simple-to-complex\" model of visual processing in the brain posits that visual tasks on complex objects such as faces are based on representations in high-level visual areas. Yet, recent experimental data showing the visual systems ability to localize faces in natural images within 100ms (Crouzet et al., 2010) challenge the prevalent hierarchical description of the visual system, and instead suggest the hypothesis of face-selectivity in early visual areas. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis with human participants in two eye tracking experiments, an fMRI experiment and an EEG experiment. We found converging evidence for neural representations selective for upright faces in V1/V2, with latencies starting around 40 ms post-stimulus onset. Our findings suggest a revision of the standard \"simple-to-complex\" model of hierarchical visual processing.\n\nSignificance statementVisual processing in the brain is classically described as a series of stages with increasingly complex object representations: early visual areas encode simple visual features (such as oriented bars), and high-level visual areas encode representations for complex objects (such as faces). In the present study, we provide behavioral, fMRI, and EEG evidence for representations of complex objects - namely faces - in early visual areas. Our results challenge the standard \"simple-to-complex\" model of visual processing, suggesting that it needs to be revised to include neural representations for faces at the lowest levels of the visual hierarchy. Such early object representations would permit the rapid and precise localization of complex objects, as has previously been reported for the object class of faces.",

    "abstract": "Older adults exhibit prominent impairments in their capacity to navigate, reorient in unfamiliar environments or update their path when faced with obstacles. This decline in navigational capabilities has traditionally been ascribed to memory impairments and dysexecutive function whereas the impact of visual aging has often been overlooked. The ability to perceive visuo-spatial information such as salient landmarks is essential to navigate in space efficiently. To date, the functional and neurobiological factors underpinning landmark processing in aging remain insufficiently characterized. To address this issue, this study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the brain activity associated with landmark-based navigation in young and healthy older participants. Twenty-five young adults (=25.4 years, {sigma}=4.7; 7F) and twenty-one older adults (=73.0 years, {sigma}=3.9; 10F) performed a virtual navigation task in the scanner in which they could only orient using salient landmarks. The underlying whole-brain patterns of activity as well as the functional roles of scene-selective regions, the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the occipital place area (OPA), and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) were analyzed. We found that older adults navigational abilities were diminished compared to young adults and that the two age groups relied on distinct navigational strategies to solve the task. Better performance during landmark-based navigation was found to be associated with increased neural activity in an extended neural network comprising several cortical and cerebellar regions. Direct comparisons between age groups further revealed that young participants had enhanced anterior temporal activity. In addition, young adults only were found to recruit occipital areas corresponding to the cortical projection of the central visual field during landmark-based navigation. The region-of-interest analysis revealed increased OPA activation in older adult participants. There were no significant between-group differences in PPA and RSC activations. These results hint at the possibility that aging diminishes fine-grained information processing in occipital and temporal regions thus hindering the capacity to use landmarks adequately for navigation. This work helps towards a better comprehension of the neural dynamics subtending landmark-based navigation and it provides new insights on the impact of age-related visuo-spatial processing changes on navigation capabilities.",

Since procedural memories are expressed through movements, the exact nature of the dS function has proven difficult to delineate. Here we challenged rats in complementary tasks designed to alleviate this performance confound. Surprisingly, dS lesions spared task-specific procedural memories but altered the kinematics of their expression in motor routines. Further behavioral analyses combined with simulations in the optimal control framework indicated that these alterations reflected an increased sensitivity to effort with preserved reward-seeking and ability to modulate movement speed. By setting the sensitivity to effort, the dS contributes to the optimization of the energy invested into voluntary movements. Such an elementary function of the dS might explain its implication in both procedural decisions and the control of movement speed.",

    "abstract": "The ability to effectively suppress motor response tendencies is essential for focused and goal-directed behavior. Here, we tested the hypothesis that developmental improvement in the ability to cancel a motor response is reflected by maturational changes in the white matter underlying the right presupplementary motor area (preSMA) and posterior inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), two cortical key areas of the fronto-basal ganglia \"stopping\" network. Eighty-eight typically-developing children and adolescents, aged 7-19 years, were longitudinally assessed with the stop-signal task (SST) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the brain over a period of six years. Participants were examined from two to nine times with an average of 6.6 times, resulting in 576 SST-DTI datasets. We applied tract-based spatial statistics to extract mean fractional anisotropy (FA) from regions-of-interest in the white matter underlying the right IFG (IFGFA) and right preSMA (preSMAFA) at each time point. Motor response cancelation performance, estimated with the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), improved with age. Initially well performing children plateaued around the age of 11 years, while initially poor performers caught up at the age of 13-14 years. White matter microstructure continued to mature across the investigated age range. Males generally displayed linear maturational trajectories, while females displayed more curvilinear trajectories that leveled off around 12-14 years of age. Maturational increases in right preSMAFA but not right IFGFA were associated with developmental improvements in SSRT. This association differed depending on the mean right preSMAFA across the individual maturational trajectory. Children with lower mean right preSMAFA exhibited poorer SSRT performance at younger ages but steeper developmental trajectories of SSRT improvement. Children with higher mean right preSMAFA exhibited flatter trajectories of SSRT improvement along with faster SSRT already at the first assessments. The results suggest that no further improvement in motor response cancellation is achieved once a certain level of maturity in the white matter underlying the right preSMA is reached. Similar dynamics may apply to other behavioral read-outs and brain structures and, thus, need to be considered in longitudinal MRI studies designed to map brain structural correlates of behavioral changes during development.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMotor response cancellation, i.e. SSRT, improvement plateaued at 13-14 years of age\nC_LIO_LIFractional anisotropy (FA) captured maturation of white matter (WM) microstructure\nC_LIO_LIFA in the WM underlying right preSMA (preSMAFA) reflected SSRT improvement with age\nC_LIO_LIIndividual SSRT improvement depended on mean right preSMAFA across all DTI sessions\nC_LIO_LIChildren with lower mean right preSMAFA had the steepest improvements in SSRT\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Recent work demonstrated that Central Nervous System (CNS) inflammation induces endothelial Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) opening as well as the formation of a tight junction barrier between reactive astrocytes at the Glia Limitans. We hypothesized that these two barriers may be reciprocally regulated by each other state and further, that the CNS parenchyma may acquire protection from the reactive astrocytic Glia Limitans not only in neuro-inflammation but also when BBB integrity is compromised under resting condition, without pathology. Previous studies identified Sonic hedgehog (Shh) astrocytic secretion as implicated in stabilizing the BBB during neuropathology and we recently demonstrated that desert hedgehog (Dhh) is expressed at the BBB in adults.\n\nHere we unraveled the role of the morphogen Dhh in maintaining BBB tightness and, using endothelial Dhh knockdown as a model of permeable BBB, we demonstrated that a double barrier system comprising both the BBB and Glia Limitans, is implemented in the CNS and regulated by a crosstalk going from endothelial cell to astrocytes.\n\nFirst, we showed that, under neuro-inflammatory conditions, Dhh expression is severely down regulated at the BBB and that Dhh is necessary for endothelial intercellular junction integrity as Dhh knockdown leads to CNS vascular leakage. We then demonstrated that, in Dhh endothelial knockout (DhhECKO) mice which display an open BBB, astrocytes are reactive and express the tight junction Claudin 4 (Cldn4) and showed that astrocytes can respond to signals secreted by the permeable endothelial BBB by becoming reactive and expressing Cldn4. To examine the consequences of the above results on disease severity, we finally induced multiple sclerosis in DhhECKO mice versus control littermates and showed that the pathology is less severe in the knockout animals due to Glia Limitans tightening, in response to BBB leakage, which drives inflammatory infiltrate entrapment into the perivascular space. Altogether these results suggest that genetic disruption of the BBB generates endothelial signals capable of driving the implementation of a secondary barrier at the Glia Limitans to protect the parenchyma. The concept of a reciprocally regulated CNS double barrier system has implications for treatment strategies in both the acute and chronic phases of multiple sclerosis pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cells (RGC) are the primary cell type injured in a variety of diseases of the optic nerve, and the early changes of RGCs RNA profiling may be important to understand the mechanism of optic nerve injury and axon regeneration. Here we employed the optic nerve crush (ONC) model to explore early mRNA alterations in RGCs using laser capture microdissection (LCM) and single-cell RNA sequencing. We successfully established an optimal LCM protocol using 30 m-thick retinal tissue sections mounted on glass slides and laser pressure catapulting (LPC) to collect RGCs and obtain high-quality RNA for single-cell sequencing. Based on our protocol, we identified 8744 differentially expressed genes that were involved in ONC-related early mRNA alterations in RGCs. Candidate genes included Atf3, Lgals3, LOC102551701, Plaur, Tmem140 and Maml1. The LCM-based single-cell RNA sequencing allowed new insights into the early mRNA changes in RGCs, highlighting new molecules associated with ONC.",

Such devices typically have centimeter-scale dimensions, requiring surgical implantation and wired-in powering. Using smaller, remotely powered materials could lead to less invasive neuromodulation. Herein, we present injectable magnetoelectric nanoelectrodes that wirelessly transmit electrical signals to the brain in response to an external magnetic field. Importantly, this mechanism of modulation requires no genetic modification of the brain, and allows animals to freely move during stimulation. Using these nanoelectrodes, we demonstrate neuronal modulation in vitro and in deep brain targets in vivo. We also show that local thalamic modulation promotes modulation in other regions connected via basal ganglia circuitry, leading to behavioral changes in mice. Magnetoelectric materials present a versatile platform technology for less invasive, deep brain neuromodulation.",

Together, these drugs have treatment indications in both early-stage and metastatic settings for HER2+ breast cancer. T-DM1 retains the antibody functionalities of trastuzumab and adds the potency of a cytotoxic maytansine payload. Interestingly, in the clinic, T-DM1 cannot always replace the use of trastuzumab plus chemotherapy administered together as single agents. We hypothesize that this failure may be due in part to the limited systemic exposure achieved by T-DM1 relative to trastuzumab because of toxicity-related dosing constraints on the ADC. We have developed a trastuzumab-based ADC site-specifically conjugated to maytansine through a noncleavable linker. This construct, termed CAT-01-106, has a drug-to-antibody ratio (DAR) of 1.8, approximately half the average DAR of T-DM1, which comprises a mixture of antibodies variously conjugated with DARs ranging from 0-8. The high DAR species present in T-DM1 contribute to its toxicity and limit its clinical dose. CAT-01-106 showed superior in vivo efficacy compared to T-DM1 at equal payload dosing and was equally or better tolerated compared to T-DM1 at equal payload dosing up to 120 mg/kg in Sprague-Dawley rats and 60 mg/kg in cynomolgus monkeys. CAT-01-106 also showed improved pharmacokinetics in rats relative to T-DM1, with 40% higher ADC exposure levels. Together, the data suggest that CAT-01-106 may be sufficiently tolerable to enable clinical dosing at trastuzumab-equivalent exposure levels, combining the functions of both the antibody and the payload in one drug and potentially improving patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Mediterranean islands are critical for migrating birds, providing shelter and sustenance for millions of individuals each year. Humans have long exploited bird migration through hunting and illegal trapping. On the island of Cyprus, trapping birds during their migratory peak is considered a local tradition, but has long been against the law. Illegal bird trapping is a lucrative business, however, with trappers using tape lures that broadcast species\u2019 vocalizations because it is expected to increase numbers of target species. Yet, by how much the use of song playback increases capture rates remains underappreciated. In particular, it is not known whether song playback of target species affects bycatch rates. Here, we show with the use of playback experiments that song playback is highly effective in luring birds towards trapping sites. We found that playback increases six to eight times the number of individuals of target species captured, but also significantly increases bycatch. Our findings thus show that in contrast to popular belief that tape lures are a selective trapping method, they also lead to increased captures of non-target species, which can include species of conservation concern.View Full Text",

Phospholipids are actively and selectively flipped by P4-ATPases from the exoplasmic leaflet to the cytoplasmic leaflet. How lipid flipping is coupled with ATP-hydrolysis by P4-ATPases is poorly understood. Here, we report the electron cryo-microscopy structures of a P4-ATPase, Dnf1-Cdc50 from Chaetomium thermophilum, which had been reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs and captured in two transport intermediate states. The structures reveal that transmembrane segment 1 of Dnf1 becomes highly flexible during lipid transport. The local lipid bilayers are distorted to facilitate the entry of the phospholipid substrates from the exoplasmic leaflet to a cross-membrane groove. During transport, the lipid substrates are relayed through four binding sites in the groove which constantly shields the lipid polar heads away from the hydrophobic environment of the membranes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe deep ocean is characterized by low temperatures, high hydrostatic pressures, and low concentrations of organic matter. While these conditions likely select for distinct genomic characteristics within prokaryotes, the attributes facilitating adaptation to the deep ocean are relatively unexplored. In this study, we compared the genomes of seven strains within the genus Colwellia, including some of the most piezophilic microbes known, to identify genomic features that enable life in the deep sea.\n\nResultsSignificant differences were found to exist between piezophilic and non-piezophilic strains of Colwellia. Piezophilic Colwellia have a more basic and hydrophobic proteome. The piezophilic abyssal and hadal isolates have more genes involved in replication/recombination/repair, cell wall/membrane biogenesis, and cell motility. The characteristics of respiration, pilus generation, and membrane fluidity adjustment vary between the strains, with operons for a nuo dehydrogenase and a tad pilus only present in the piezophiles. In contrast, the piezosensitive members are unique in having the capacity for dissimilatory nitrite and TMAO reduction. A number of genes exist only within deep-sea adapted species, such as those encoding d-alanine-d-alanine ligase for peptidoglycan formation, alanine dehydrogenase for NADH/NAD+ homeostasis, and archaeal methyltransferase for tRNA modification. Many of these piezophile-specific genes are in variable regions of the genome near genomic islands, transposases, and toxin-antitoxin systems.\n\nConclusionsWe identified a number of adaptations that may facilitate deep-sea radiation in members of the genus Colwellia, as well as in other piezophilic bacteria. An enrichment in more basic and hydrophobic amino acids could help piezophiles stabilize and limit water intrusion into proteins as a result of high pressure. Variations in genes associated with the membrane, including those involved in unsaturated fatty acid production and respiration, indicate that membrane-based adaptations are critical for coping with high pressure. The presence of many piezophile-specific genes near genomic islands highlights that adaptation to the deep ocean may be facilitated by horizontal gene transfer through transposases or other mobile elements. Some of these genes are amenable to further study in genetically tractable piezophilic and piezotolerant deep-sea microorganisms.",

    "abstract": "Recent changes in policy regarding cannabis in the U.S. have been accompanied by an increase in the prevalence of cannabis use and a reduction in the perceived harms associated with consumption. However, little is understood regarding the effects of cannabinoids on cognitive processes. Given that deficient risk-taking is commonly observed in individuals suffering from substance use disorders (SUDs), we assessed the impact of manipulating cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs; the primary target for {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol in the brain) on punishment-based risk-taking using the risky decision-making task (RDT) in male Long-Evans rats. The RDT measures preference for small, safe rewards over large, risky rewards associated with an escalating chance of foot shock. Systemic bidirectional CB1R manipulation with a CB1R agonist, CB1R antagonist, and FAAH inhibitor (which increases overall endocannabinoid tone) did not alter overt risk-taking in the RDT. Interestingly, direct CB1R agonism, but not indirect CB1R stimulation or CB1R blockade, resulted in reduction in latency to make risky choices while not altering safe choice latency. Our findings suggest that CB1R activation expedites engagement in punishment based risk-taking without affecting overall preference for risky vs. safe options. This indicates that risk preference and rate of deliberation for risk-taking are influenced by distinct neural substrates, an important consideration for development of precise treatments targeting the aberrant risk-taking typical of SUD symptomology.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) mutates rapidly, resulting in antigenic drift and poor year-to-year vaccine effectiveness. One challenge in designing effective vaccines is that genetic mutations frequently cause amino acid variations in IAV envelope protein hemagglutinin (HA) that create new N-glycosylation sequons; resulting N-glycans cause antigenic shielding, allowing viral escape from adaptive immune responses. Vaccine candidate strain selection currently involves correlating antigenicity with HA protein sequence among circulating strains, but quantitative comparison of site-specific glycosylation information may likely improve the ability to design vaccines with broader effectiveness against evolving strains. However, there is poor understanding of the influence of glycosylation on immunodominance, antigenicity, and immunogenicity of HA, and there are no well-tested methods for comparing glycosylation similarity among virus samples. Here, we present a method for statistically rigorous quantification of similarity between two related virus strains that considers the presence and abundance of glycopeptide glycoforms. We demonstrate the strength of our approach by determining that there was a quantifiable difference in glycosylation at the protein level between wild-type IAV HA from A/Switzerland/9715293/2013 (SWZ13) and a mutant strain of SWZ13, even though no N-glycosylation sequons were changed. We determined site-specifically that WT and mutant HA have varying similarity at the glycosylation sites of the head domain, reflecting competing pressures to evade host immune response while retaining viral fitness. To our knowledge, our results are the first to quantify changes in glycosylation state that occur in related proteins of considerable glycan heterogeneity. Our results provide a method for understanding how changes in glycosylation state are correlated with variations in protein sequence, which is necessary for improving IAV vaccine strain selection. Understanding glycosylation will be especially important as we find new expression vectors for vaccine production, as glycosylation state depends greatly on the host species.",

Here, we have developed a method to enhance co-differentiation and maintenance of ECs within HIOs (vHIOs). Given that ECs are known to possess organ specific gene expression, morphology and function, we used bulk RNAseq and scRNAseq to interrogate the developing human intestine, lung, and kidney in order to identify organ-enriched EC-gene signatures in these organ systems. By comparing organ-specific gene signatures along with markers validated by fluorescent in situ hybridization to HIO ECs, we find that HIO ECs grown in vitro share the highest similarity with native intestinal ECs relative to kidney and lung. Together, these data show that HIOs can co-differentiate a native EC population that are properly patterned with an intestine-specific EC transcriptional signature in vitro.",

In neuropils, densely packed neurons synaptically interconnect into precise circuit architecture2,3, yet the structural and developmental principles governing nanoscale precision in bundled neuropil assembly remain largely unknown4-6. Here we use diffusion condensation, a coarse-graining clustering algorithm7, to identify nested circuit structures within the C. elegans cerebral neuropil (called the nerve ring). We determine that the nerve ring neuropil is organized into four tightly bundled strata composed of related behavioral circuits. We demonstrate that the stratified architecture of the neuropil is a geometrical representation of the functional segregation of sensory information and motor outputs, with specific sensory organs and muscle quadrants mapping onto particular neuropil strata. We identify groups of neurons with unique morphologies that integrate information across strata and that create a sophisticated honeycomb-shaped scaffold that encases the strata within the nerve ring. We resolve the developmental sequence leading to stratified neuropil organization through the integration of lineaging and cell tracking algorithms with high resolution light-sheet microscopy, and reveal principles of cell position, migration and hierarchical outgrowth that guide neuropil organization. Our results uncover conserved design principles underlying nerve ring neuropil architecture and function, and a pioneer neuron-based, temporal progression of outgrowth that guides the hierarchical development of the layered neuropil.

    "abstract": "Efficient mammalian autophagosome biogenesis requires coordinated input from other cellular endomembrane compartments. Such coordination includes the stimulated trafficking to autophagosome assembly sites of the essential autophagy proteins, ATG9 and ATG16L1, via distinct endosomal compartments. Protein trafficking within the endocytic network is directed by a conserved family of sorting nexins (SNXs), with previous studies implicating SNX18 (an SH3 domain-type SNX-BAR protein) in the mobilisation of ATG9A and ATG16L1 from recycling endosomes during autophagy. Using siRNA and CRISPR-Cas9, we demonstrate that a second mammalian SNX-BAR, SNX4, is needed for efficient LC3 lipidation and autophagosome assembly in mammalian cells. SNX-BARs exist as homo- and heterodimers, and we show that SNX4 forms functional heterodimers with either SNX7 or SNX30, and that these associate with tubulovesicular endocytic membranes at steady state. Detailed image-based analysis during the early stages of autophagosome assembly reveal that SNX4:SNX7 is the autophagy-specific heterodimeric SNX-BAR complex, required for efficient recruitment/retention of core autophagy regulators at the nascent isolation membrane. SNX4 partially co-localises with juxtanuclear ATG9A-positive membranes, with our data linking the SNX4 autophagy defect to the mis-trafficking and/or retention of ATG9A in the Golgi region. Together, our findings show that the SNX4:SNX7 heterodimer coordinates ATG9A trafficking within the endocytic network to establish productive autophagosome assembly sites.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTA heterodimeric SNX4:SNX7 SNX-BAR complex regulates mammalian autophagosome assembly through the control of ATG9 trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Membrane fusion, an essential process in all eukaryotes, is driven by SNARE proteins. Ykt6 is an essential SNARE that plays critical roles throughout the secretory, endocytic, and autophagy pathways. Ykt6 activity is thought to be regulated by a conformational change from a closed cytosolic form to an open membrane-bound form, yet the mechanism that regulates this transition is unknown. Through genetic, pharmacologic, and structural modeling approaches in mammalian cells, we found that phosphorylation regulates Ykt6 conversion from a closed to an open state. The phosphorylation site we identified is highly conserved in evolution and is regulated by the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. We found that phosphorylation is a key determinant for intracellular localization of Ykt6 and its function in macroautophagy. Our studies reveal a novel mechanism by which Ykt6 conformation and activity is regulated by Ca2+ signaling with implications in Parkinsons Disease in which Ykt6 has been shown to play a role.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesPluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes are phenotypically immature, which limits their utility in downstream applications. Metabolism is dramatically reprogramed during cardiac maturation in vivo and presents a potential avenue to drive in vitro maturation. We aimed to identify and address metabolic bottlenecks in the generation of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiomyocytes.\n\nMethodshPSCs were differentiated into cardiomyocytes using an established, chemically-defined differentiation protocol. We applied 13C metabolic flux analysis (MFA) and targeted transcriptomics to characterize cardiomyocyte metabolism in during differentiation in the presence or absence of exogenous lipids.\n\nResultshPSC-derived cardiomyocytes induced some cardiometabolic pathways (i.e. ketone body and branched-chain amino acid oxidation) but failed to effectively activate fatty acid oxidation. MFA studies indicated that lipid availability in cultures became limited during differentiation, suggesting potential issues with nutrient availability. Exogenous supplementation of lipids improved cardiomyocyte morphology, mitochondrial function, and promoted increased fatty acid oxidation in hPSC-derivatives.\n\nConclusionhPSC-derived cardiomyocytes are dependent upon exogenous sources of lipids for metabolic maturation. Proper supplementation removes a potential roadblock in the generation of metabolically mature cardiomyocytes. These studies further highlight the importance of considering and exploiting metabolic phenotypes in the in vitro production and utilization of functional hPSC-derivatives.",

    "abstract": "Despite a common understanding that Gli TFs are utilized to reiterate a Hh morphogen gradient, genetic analyses suggest craniofacial development does not completely fit this paradigm. We demonstrated that rather than being driven by a Hh threshold, robust Gli3 transcriptional activity during skeletal and glossal development required interaction with the bHLH TF Hand2. Not only did genetic and expression data support a co-factorial relationship, but genomic analysis further revealed that Gli3 and Hand2 were enriched at regulatory elements for genes essential for mandibular patterning and development. Interestingly, motif analysis at sites co-occupied by Gli3 and Hand2 uncovered mandibular-specific, low-affinity,  divergent Gli binding motifs (dGBMs). Functional validation revealed these dGBMs conveyed synergistic activation of Gli targets essential for mandibular patterning and development. In summary, this work elucidates a novel, sequence-dependent mechanism for Gli transcriptional activity within the craniofacial complex that is independent of a graded Hh signal.",

    "abstract": "Novel open reading frames (nORFs) with coding potential may arise from noncoding DNA. Not much is known about their emergence, functional role, fixation in a population or contribution to adaptive radiation. Cichlids fishes exhibit extensive phenotypic diversification and speciation. Encounters with new environments alone are not sufficient to explain this striking diversity of cichlid radiation because other taxa coexistent with the Cichlidae demonstrate lower species richness. Wagner et al analyzed cichlid diversification in 46 African lakes and reported that both extrinsic environmental factors and intrinsic lineage-specific traits related to sexual selection have strongly influenced the cichlid radiation 1, which indicates the existence of unknown molecular mechanisms responsible for rapid phenotypic diversification, such as emergence of novel open reading frames (nORFs). In this study, we integrated transcriptomic and proteomic signatures from two tissues of two cichlids species, identified nORFs and performed evolutionary analysis on these nORF regions. Our results suggest that the time scale of speciation of the two species and evolutionary divergence of these nORF genomic regions are similar and indicate a potential role for these nORFs in speciation of the cichlid fishes.",

We find that focal, reversible blockade of GABAergic input onto Imc neurons disconnects their extraclassical inhibitory surrounds, but, surprisingly, leaves intact their classical surrounds. Subsequently, with paired recordings and iontophoresis, first at spatially aligned site-pairs in Imc and OT, and then, at mutually distant site-pairs within Imc, we demonstrate that classical inhibitory surrounds of Imc RFs are inherited from OT, but their extraclassical inhibitory surrounds are constructed within Imc.

    "abstract": "AimIndoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO) is responsible for the progression of the kynurenine pathway, which has been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammation-induced depression. It has been reported that asperosaponin VI (ASA VI) could play a neuroprotective role through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. In this study, we examined the antidepressant effect of ASA VI in LPS-treated mice and further explored its molecular mechanism by insight into the microglial kynurenine pathway.\n\nMethodsTo produce the model, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (0.83 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally to mice. The mice received ASA VI (10 mg/kg, 20mg/kg, 40mg/kg and 80mg/kg, i.p.) thirty minutes prior to LPS injection. Depressive-like behaviors were evaluated based on the duration of immobility in the forced swim test. Microglial activation and inflammatory cytokines were detected by immunohistochemistry, real-time PCR and ELISA. The TLR4/NF-B signaling pathway and the expression of IDO, GluA2, and CamKII{beta} were measured by western blotting.\n\nResultsASA VI demonstrated significant antidepressant activity in the presence of LPS on immobility and latency times in the forced swim test. The LPS-induced activation of microglia and inflammatory response were inhabited by ASA VI in a dose-dependent manner. TLR4/NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway also was suppressed by ASA VI in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of LPS-treated mice. Furthermore, ASA VI inhibited the increase in IDO protein expression and normalized the aberrant glutamate transmission in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex as a result of LPS administration.\n\nConclusionOur results propose a promising antidepressant effect for ASA VI possibly through the downregulation of IDO expression and normalization of the aberrant glutamate transmission. This remedying effect of ASA VI could be attributed to suppress microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response via inhibiting the TLR4/NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is a ubiquitous chromatin feature -- in maize, more than 25% of cytosines in the genome are methylated. Recently, major progress has been made in describing the molecular mechanisms driving methylation, yet variation and evolution of the methylation landscape during maize domestication remain largely unknown. Here we leveraged whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on populations of modern maize, landrace, and teosinte (Zea mays ssp. parviglumis) to investigate the adaptive and phenotypic consequences of methylation variations in maize. By using a novel estimation approach, we inferred the methylome site frequency spectrum (mSFS) to estimate forward and backward epimutation rates and selection coefficients. We found weak evidence for direct selection on DNA methylation in any context, but thousands of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified in population-wide that are correlated with recent selection. Further investigation revealed that DMRs are enriched in 5 untranslated regions, and that maize hypomethylated DMRs likely helped rewire distal gene regulation. For two trait-associated DMRs, vgt1-DMR and tb1-DMR, our HiChIP data indicated that the interactive loops between DMRs and respective downstream genes were present in B73, a modern maize line, but absent in teosinte. Functional analyses suggested that these DMRs likely served as cis-acting elements that modulated gene regulation after domestication. Our results enable a better understanding of the evolutionary forces acting on patterns of DNA methylation and suggest a role of methylation variation in adaptive evolution.",

    "abstract": "Phoresy is a behavior in which an organism, the phoront, travels from one location to another by  hitching a ride on the body of a host as it disperses. Some phoronts are generalists, taking advantage of any available host. Others are specialists and travel only when specific hosts are located using chemical cues to identify and move (chemotax) toward the preferred host. Free-living nematodes, like Caenorhabditis elegans, are often found in natural environments that contain terrestrial isopods and other invertebrates. Additionally, the C. elegans wild strain PB306 was isolated associated with the isopod Porcellio scaber. However, it is currently unclear if C. elegans is a phoront of terrestrial isopods, and if so, whether it is a specialist, generalist, or developmental stage-specific combination of both strategies. Because the relevant chemical stimuli might be secreted compounds or volatile odorants, we used different types of chemotaxis assays across diverse extractions of compounds or odorants to test whether C. elegans is attracted to P. scaber. We show that two different strains - the wild isolate PB306 and the laboratory-adapted strain N2 - are not attracted to P. scaber during either the dauer or adult life stages. Our results indicate that C. elegans was not attracted to chemical compounds or volatile odorants from P. scaber, providing valuable empirical evidence to suggest that any associations between these two species are likely opportunistic rather than specific phoresy.",

Mutations of transport granule protein hnRNPA2 cause hereditary proteinopathy of neurons, myocytes, and bone.

A C. elegans model of hnRNPA2 D290V-associated neurodegeneration exhibits TDP-43 ortholog-dependent glutamatergic neurodegeneration.

    "abstract": "17 years after the SARS-CoV epidemic, the world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. Given the most optimistic projections estimating that it will take over a year to develop a vaccine, the best short-term strategy may lie in identifying virus-specific targets for small molecule interventions. All coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called -1 PRF to control the relative expression of their proteins. Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it employs a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, and that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element. Altering -1 PRF activity negatively impacts virus replication, suggesting that this molecular mechanism may be therapeutically targeted. Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural and functional analyses revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery sites and in all three stems of the pseudoknot strongly ablated -1 PRF activity. The upstream attenuator hairpin activity has also been functionally retained. Small-angle x-ray scattering indicated that the pseudoknots in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 had the same conformation. Finally, a small molecule previously shown to bind the SARS-CoV pseudoknot and inhibit -1 PRF was similarly effective against -1 PRF in SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that such frameshift inhibitors may provide promising lead compounds to counter the current pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Computations in the brain are broadly assumed to emerge from patterns of fast electrical activity. Challenging this view, we show that a male flys decision to persist in mating, even through a potentially lethal threat, hinges on biochemical computations that enable processing over minutes to hours. Each neuron in a recurrent network measuring time into mating contains slightly different internal molecular estimates of elapsed time. Protein Kinase A (PKA) activity contrasts this internal measurement with input from the other neurons to represent evidence that the networks goal has been achieved. When consensus is reached, PKA pushes the network toward a large-scale and synchronized burst of calcium influx, which we call an eruption. The eruption functions like an action potential at the level of the network, transforming deliberation within the network into an all-or-nothing output, after which the male will no longer sacrifice his life to continue mating. We detail the continuous transformation between interwoven molecular and electrical information over long timescales in this system, showing how biochemical activity, invisible to most large scale recording techniques, is the key computational currency directing a life-or-death decision.",

    "abstract": "How do we encode our continuous life experiences for later retrieval? Theories of event segmentation and integration suggest that the hippocampus binds separately represented events into an ordered narrative. Using a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) movie watching-recall dataset, we quantified two types of neural similarities (i.e., activation pattern similarity and within-region voxel-based connectivity pattern similarity) between separate events during movie watching and related them to subsequent retrieval of events as well as retrieval of sequential order. We demonstrated that compared to forgotten events, successfully remembered events were associated with distinct activation patterns in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. By contrast, similar connectivity patterns between events were associated with memory formation and were also relevant for retaining events in the correct order. We applied the same approaches to an independent movie watching fMRI dataset as validation and highlighted again the role of hippocampal activation pattern and connectivity pattern in memory formation. We propose that distinct activation patterns represent neural segmentation of events while similar connectivity patterns encode context information, and therefore integrate events into a narrative. Our results provide novel evidence for the role of hippocampal-medial prefrontal event segmentation and integration in episodic memory formation of real-life experience.",

    "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of proteins that recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Their primary function is to activate innate immune responses while also involved in facilitating adaptive immune responses. Different TLRs exert distinct functions by activating varied immune cascades. Several TLRs are being pursued as cancer drug targets. We discovered a novel, highly potent and selective small molecule TLR8 agonist DN052. DN052 exhibited strong in vitro cellular activity with EC50 at 6.7 nM and was highly selective for TLR8 over other TLRs including TLR4, 7 and 9. The selectivity profile distinguished DN052 from all other TLR agonists currently in clinical development. DN052 displayed excellent in vitro ADMET and in vivo PK profiles. DN052 potently inhibited tumor growth as a single agent. Moreover, combination of DN052 with the immune checkpoint inhibitor, selected targeted therapeutics or chemotherapeutic drugs further enhanced efficacy of single agents. Mechanistically, treatment with DN052 resulted in strong induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines in ex vivo human PBMC assay and in vivo monkey study. GLP toxicity studies in rats and monkeys demonstrated favorable safety profile. This led to the advancement of DN052 into phase I clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "The reproductive fitness of the Anopheles gambiae mosquito represents a promising target to prevent malaria transmission. The ecdysteroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E), transferred from male to female during copulation, is key to An. gambiae reproductive success as it licenses females to oviposit eggs developed after blood feeding. Here we show that 20E-triggered oviposition in these mosquitoes is regulated by the stress- and immune-responsive c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The heads of mated females exhibit a transcriptional signature reminiscent of a JNK-dependent wounding response while mating -- or injection of virgins with exogenous 20E -- selectively activates JNK in the same tissue. RNAi-mediated depletion of JNK pathway components inhibits oviposition in mated females, whereas JNK activation by silencing the JNK phosphatase puckered induces egg laying in virgins. Together, these data identify JNK as a potential conduit linking stress responses and reproductive success in the most important vector of malaria.",

Leucine-zipper-like transcription regulator 1 (LZTR1) is inactivated by non-synonymous mutations and copy number losses, suggesting that it is a tumor suppressor in glioblastoma. However, how LZTR1 mutations contribute to glioblastoma pathogenesis remains poorly understood. Here, we revealed that LZTR1, as an adaptor of the CUL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, recognizes and triggers ubiquitin-dependent degradation of oncoprotein RIT1, a RAS-like GTPase. Wild-type LZTR1 suppresses glioblastoma cell proliferation and migration by inactivating the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway in a RIT1-dependent manner. However, the effects were abrogated by the glioblastoma-associated LZTR1 mutations. Our findings revealed the underlying molecular mechanism of LZTR1 mutations-driven glioblastoma, and provide novel therapeutic target for LZTR1 mutations-driven glioblastoma.",

Type I systems in which Cas3 nuclease degrades the target DNA are known; in contrast, for the sub-type CRISPR type I-D (TiD), which lacks a typical Cas3 nuclease in its cascade, the mechanism of target DNA degradation remains unknown. Here, we found that Cas10d--a nuclease in TiD--is multi-functional in PAM recognition, stabilization and target DNA degradation. TiD can be used for targeted mutagenesis of genomic DNA in human cells, directing both bi-directional long-range deletions and short insertions/deletions. TiD off-target effects, which were dependent on the mismatch position in the protospacer of TiD, were also identified. Our findings suggest TiD as a unique effector pathway in CRISPR that can be repurposed for genome engineering in eukaryotic cells.",

    "abstract": "Long-term synaptic plasticity, in the form of either potentiation or depression (LTP or LTD), is thought to provide the substrate for adaptive computations in brain circuits. Although molecular and cellular processes of plasticity have been clarified to a considerable extent at individual synapses, very little is known about the spatiotemporal organization of LTP and LTD in local microcircuits. Here, we have combined multi-spot two-photon laser microscopy and realistic modeling to map the distribution of plasticity in multi-neuronal units of the cerebellar granular layer activated by stimulating an afferent mossy fiber bundle. The units, composed by ~300 active neurons connected to ~50 glomeruli, showed potentiation concentrated in the core and depression in the periphery. This plasticity was effectively accounted for by an NMDA receptor and calcium-dependent induction rule and was regulated by local microcircuit mechanisms in the inhibitory Golgi cell loops. The organization of LTP and LTD created effective spatial filters tuning the time-delay and gain of spike retransmission at the cerebellum input stage and provided a plausible basis for the spatiotemporal recoding of input spike patterns anticipated by the motor learning theory.",

    "abstract": "The possibility to combine smaller units of meaning (e.g., words) to create new and more complex meanings (e.g., phrases and sentences) is a fundamental feature of human language. In the present project, we investigated how the brain supports the semantic and syntactic composition of two-word adjective-noun phrases in Dutch, using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The present investigation followed up on previous studies reporting a composition effect in the left anterior temporal lobe (LATL) when comparing neural activity at nouns combined with adjectives, as opposed to nouns in a non-compositional context. The first aim of the present study was to investigate whether this effect, as well as its modulation by noun specificity and adjective class, can also be observed in Dutch. A second aim was to investigate to what extent these effects may be driven by syntactic composition rather than primarily by semantic composition as was previously proposed. To this end, a novel condition was administered in which participants saw nouns combined with pseudowords lacking meaning but agreeing with the nouns in terms of grammatical gender, as real adjectives would. We failed to observe a composition effect or its modulation in both a confirmatory analysis (focused on the cortical region and time-window where it has previously been reported) and in exploratory analyses (where we tested multiple regions and an extended potential time-window of the effect). A syntactically driven composition effect was also not observed in our data. We do, however, successfully observe an independent, previously reported effect on single word processing in our data, confirming that our MEG data processing pipeline does meaningfully capture language processing activity by the brain. The failure to observe the composition effect in LATL is surprising given that it has been previously reported in multiple studies. Reviewing all previous studies investigating this effect, we propose that materials and a task involving imagery might be necessary for this effect to be observed. In addition, we identified substantial variability in the regions of interest analysed in previous studies, which warrants additional checks of robustness of the effect. Further research should identify limits and conditions under which this effect can be observed. The failure to observe specifically a syntactic composition effect in such minimal phrases is less surprising given that it has not been previously reported in MEG data.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionPosttraumatic headache (PTH) is one of the most common, debilitating and difficult symptoms to manage after a traumatic head injury. The development of novel therapeutic approaches is nevertheless hampered by the paucity of preclinical models and poor understanding of the mechanisms underlying PTH. To address these shortcomings, we previously characterized the development of PTH-like pain behaviors in rats subjected to a single mild closed head injury using a 250 g weight drop. Here, we conducted a follow-up study to further develop this preclinical model by exploring the development of headache-like pain behaviors in male rats subjected to a single, but more severe head trauma (450 g) as well as following repetitive, subconcussive head impacts (150 g). In addition, we tested whether these behaviors involve peripheral CGRP signaling by testing the effect of systemic anti-CGRP monoclonal antibody (anti-CGRP mAb).\n\nMethodsAdult male Sprague Dawley rats (total n=138) were subjected to diffuse closed head injury using a weight-drop device, or a sham procedure. Three injury paradigms were employed: a single hit, using 450 g or 150 g weight drop, and three successive 150 g weight drop events conducted 72 hours apart. Changes in open field activity and development of headache-related cephalic and extracephalic mechanical pain hypersensitivity were assessed up to 42 days post head trauma. Treatment included systemic administration of a mouse anti-calcitonin-gene-related peptide monoclonal antibody (30 mg/kg.).\n\nResultsRats subjected to 450 g closed head injury displayed an acute decrease in rearing and increased thigmotaxis, together with cephalic and extracephalic mechanical pain hypersensitivity that resolved by 6 weeks post-injury. Repetitive subconcussive head impacts using the 150 g weight drop, but not a single event, led to decreased vertical rearing as well as prolonged cephalic and extracephalic mechanical pain hypersensitivity. Early and prolonged anti-CGRP mAb treatment inhibited the development of the cephalic, but not extracephalic pain hypersensitivities in both the severe and repetitive subconcussive head impact models.\n\nConclusionsWhen compared to the data obtained from male rats in the previous study, a more severe head injury gives rise to a prolonged state of cephalic and extracephalic hyperalgesia. Such enhanced headache-like behaviors also occur following repetitive, subconcussive head impacts. Extended headache-like behaviors following severe and repetitive mild closed head injury are ameliorated by early and prolonged anti-CGRP mAb treatment, suggesting a mechanism linked to peripheral CGRP signaling.",

A recent study provided a unique set of human and mouse pyramidal neurons of the CA1 region of the hippocampus, and used it to compare the morphology of apical and basal dendritic branches of the two species. The study found inter-species differences in the magnitude of the morphometrics and similarities regarding their variation with respect to morphological determinants such as branch type and branch order. We use the same data set to perform additional comparisons of basal dendrites. In order to isolate the heterogeneity due to intrinsic differences between species from the heterogeneity due to differences in morphological determinants, we fit multivariate models over the morphometrics and the determinants. In particular, we use conditional linear Gaussian Bayesian networks, which provide a concise graphical representation of the independencies and correlations among the variables. We also extend the previous study by considering additional morphometrics and by formally testing test whether a morphometric increases or decreases with the distance from the soma. This study introduces a multivariate methodology for inter-species comparison of morphology.",

    "abstract": "The research on the direct target of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is the key to study the mechanism and material basis of TCM, but there is still no effective technical methods at present. For Compound Danshen dropping pills (CDDP), there is no report about its direct targets. In this study, the direct targets of CDDP were studied for the first time, especially focusing on the protein kinase family, which plays causal roles in a variety of human disease. Firstly, the literature database of CDDP was constructed by literature retrieval, and the important components contained in CDDP were extracted. Secondly, the potential direct targets of important components was obtained through querying public database and predicted by Multi-voting SEA algorithm. Then, the KinomeX system was used to predict and to filter the potential kinase targets of CDDP. Finally, the experimental verification was carried out. In total, 30 active kinase targets was obtained at 25 g/ml concentration of CDDP, and 9 dose-dependent targets were obtained at 250 g/ml concentration of CDDP. This is an efficient and accurate strategy by integrating the targets recorded in several public databases and the targets calculated by two in silico modelling approaches predict potential direct targets of TCM, which can lay an important foundation for the study of the mechanism and material basis of them, promoting the modernization of TCM.",
