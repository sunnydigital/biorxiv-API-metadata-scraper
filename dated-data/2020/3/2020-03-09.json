    "abstract": "We present a flexible and general adaptive experimental design for dose finding clinical trials. This method can be applied in sterotypical settings such as determining a maximum tolerated dose, when the dose response relationship is complex, or when the response is an arbitrary quantitative measure. Our design generalizes dose finding methods such as the continual reassessment method (CRM), modified CRM, and estimation with overdose control (EWOC). Similar to those, our design requires a working mathematical model, which assures efficiency, low bias, and a higher fraction of dose selected near the optimum compared to purely operational designs. Unlike typical model based designs that always employ the same model, our method allows individual dose response models tailored to the circumstance. Simulations are also integral to our design allowing it to account for both known and unknown effects of dose on outcome. This method is applicable to general dose finding problems such as those encountered with modern targeted anti-cancer agents, immunotherapies, and titrations against biomarker outcome measures. The method can also support improvements in the design of the experiment being conducted by providing a platform for concurrent simulations to assess the influence of projected design points. Although we present the design in the context of clinical trials, it is equally applicable to experiments with non-human subjects.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionPancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is notorious for its associated skeletal muscle wasting (SMW) and mortality. Currently, the relationships between PDAC, SMW, and survival are poorly understood. Thus, there is a great need for a faithful small animal model with a quantitative longitudinal outcome measure that recapitulates clinical PDAC, to define SMW onset and assess progression. Therefore, we aimed to validate dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) as a longitudinal outcome of lean body mass, and demonstrate its utility to quantify SMW in the KCKO murine model of PDAC.\n\nMethodsIn vivo body composition of: 1) untreated mice at 5, 8, 12, 18, and 22 weeks of age (n=4), and 2) a cohort of mice with (n=20) and without PDAC (n=10), was determined via DEXA, and lean mass of the lower hind limbs was predicted via a region of interest analysis by two independent observers. Total body weight was determined. Tibialis anterior (TA) muscles were weighed and processed for histomorphometry immediately post-mortem. Statistical differences between groups were assessed using t-tests and ANOVA. Linear regression models and correlation analysis were used to measure the association between TA and DEXA mass, and reproducibility of DEXA was quantified via the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).\n\nResultsLean mass in growing untreated mice determined by DEXA correlated with TA mass (r2 = 0.94; p <0.0001) and body weight (r2 = 0.89; p <0.0001). DEXA measurements were highly reproducible between observers (ICC = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.89-0.98). DEXA and TA mass also correlated in the PDAC cohort (r2 = 0.76; p <0.0001). Significant SMW in tumor-bearing mice was detected within 38 days of implantation by DEXA, TA mass, and histomorphometry.\n\nConclusionsDEXA is a longitudinal outcome measure of lower limb lean mass in mice. The KCKO syngeneic model is a bona fide model of PDAC-associated SMW that can be quantified with longitudinal DEXA.",

    "abstract": "Model systems are necessary to understand the biology of SCLC and develop new therapies against this recalcitrant disease. Here we provide the first online resource, CellMiner-SCLC (https://discover.nci.nih.gov/SclcCellMinerCDB) incorporating 118 individual SCLC cell lines and extensive omics and drug sensitivity datasets, including high resolution methylome performed for the purpose of the current study. We demonstrate the reproducibility of the cell lines and genomic data across the CCLE, GDSC, CTRP, NCI and UTSW datasets. We validate the SCLC classification based on four master transcription factors: NEUROD1, ASCL1, POU2F3 and YAP1 (NAPY classification) and show transcription networks connecting each them with their downstream and upstream regulators as well as with the NOTCH and HIPPO pathways and the MYC genes (MYC, MYCL1 and MYCN). We find that each of the 4 subsets express specific surface markers for antibody-targeted therapies. The SCLC-Y cell lines differ from the other subsets by expressing the NOTCH pathway and the antigen-presenting machinery (APM), and responding to mTOR and AKT inhibitors. Our analyses suggest the potential value of NOTCH activators, YAP1 inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors in SCLC-Y tumors that can now be independently validated.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/980623v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (65K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10930e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@699d9corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea773corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3a1589_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LISCLC-CellMiner provides the most extensive SCLC resource in terms of number of cell lines (118 cell lines), extensive omics data (exome, microarray, RNA-seq, copy number, methylomes and microRNA) and drug sensitivity testing.\nC_LIO_LIWe find evidence of distinct epigenetic profile of SCLC cell lines (global hypomethylation and histone gene methylation), which is consistent with their plasticity.\nC_LIO_LITranscriptome analyses demonstrate the coherent transcriptional networks associated with the 4 main genomic subgroups (NEUROD1, ASCL1, POU2F3 & YAP1 = NAPY classification) and their connection with the NOTCH and HIPPO signaling pathways.\nC_LIO_LISCLC-CellMiner provides a conceptual framework for the selection of therapies for SCLC in a personalized fashion allowing putative biomarkers according molecular classifications and molecular characteristics.\nC_LIO_LISCLC-Y cell lines differ from the other cancer cell lines; their transcriptome resemble NSCLC cell lines.

    "abstract": "The transcription factor Eomesodermin (EOMES) promotes IL-10 production of CD4+ T-cells, which has been linked to immunosuppressive and cytotoxic activities. We detected EOMES-expressing CD4+ T-cells in lymph node samples of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This was in line with an observed expansion of EOMES-positive CD4+ T-cells in leukemic E{micro}-TCL1 mice, a well-established model of CLL, and upon adoptive transfer of TCL1 leukemia in mice. Transcriptome and flow cytometry analyses revealed that EOMES does not only drive the transcription of IL-10, but rather controls a unique differentiation program in CD4+ T-cells. Moreover, EOMES was necessary for the accumulation of a specific CD4+ T-cell subset that expresses IFN{gamma} and IL-10, as well as inhibitory receptors, like PD-1 and LAG3. T-cell transfer studies in leukopenic Rag2-/- mice showed that EOMES-deficient CD4+ T-cells were inferior in controlling TCL1 leukemia development compared to wildtype T-cells, even though expansion of Eomes-/- CD4+ T-cells was observed. We further showed that control of TCL1 leukemia was driven by IL-10 receptor-mediated signals, as Il10rb-deficient CD4+ T-cells showed impaired anti-leukemia activity. Altogether, our data suggest that IL-10 producing PD-1+ CD4+ T-cells contribute to CLL control in an EOMES- and IL-10R-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Mechanosensing is an integral part of many physiological processes including stem cell differentiation, fibrosis, and cancer progression. Two major mechanosensing systems - focal adhesions and mechanosensitive ion channels, can convert mechanical features of the microenvironment into biochemical signals. We report here surprisingly that the mechanosensitive Ca2+-channel Piezo1, previously perceived to be diffusive on plasma membranes, binds to matrix adhesions in a force-dependent manner, promoting adhesion maturation and cell spreading in normal but not in tumor cells. In the absence of Piezo1, matrix adhesions are smaller in normal cells mimicking transformed cells where adhesions do not change with or without Piezo1. A novel adhesion-targeted calcium sensor shows robust Piezo1-dependent, calcium influx at adhesions in normal cells; but not in transformed cells. A linker domain in Piezo1 is needed for binding to adhesions and overexpression of the domain blocks Piezo1 binding to adhesions decreasing adhesion size and cell spread area. Thus, we suggest that Piezo1 is a novel component of focal adhesions in non-transformed cells that catalyzes adhesion maturation and growth through force-dependent calcium signaling, but this function is absent in most cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSynthetic chemical fluorescent dyes are promising tools for many applications in biology. SNAP tagging provides a unique opportunity for labeling of specific proteins in vivo with synthetic dyes for studying for example endocytosis, or super-resolution microscopy. However, despite the potential, chemical dye tagging has not been used effectively in plants. A major drawback was the limited knowledge regarding cell wall and membrane permeability of synthetic dyes. Twenty-six out of 31 synthetic dyes were taken up into BY-2 cells, eight were not taken up and can thus serve for measuring endocytosis. Three of the dyes that were able to enter the cells, SNAP-tag ligands of diethylaminocoumarin, tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) and silicon-rhodamine (SiR) 647 were used to SNAP tag -tubulin. Successful tagging was verified by live cell imaging and visualization of microtubules arrays in interphase and during mitosis. Fluorescence activation-coupled protein labeling (FAPL) with DRBG-488 was used to observe PIN2 endocytosis and delivery to the vacuole as well as preferential delivery of newly synthesized PIN2 to the newly forming cell plate during mitosis. Together the data demonstrate that specific self-labeling of proteins can be used effectively in plants to study a wide variety to cell biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate axial skeletal patterning is controlled by coordinated collinear expression of Hox genes and axial level-dependent activity of Hox protein combinations. Transcription factors of the Meis family act as cofactors of Hox proteins and profusely bind to Hox complex DNA, however their roles in mammalian axial patterning have not been established. Similarly, retinoic acid (RA) is known to regulate axial skeletal element identity through the transcriptional activity of its receptors, however, whether this role is related to Meis/Hox activity in axial patterning remains unknown. Here we study the role of Meis in axial skeleton formation and its relationship to the RA pathway by characterizing Meis1, Meis2 and Raldh2 mutant mice. Meis elimination produces axial skeleton defects without affecting Hox gene transcription, including vertebral homeotic transformations and rib mis-patterning associated to defects in the hypaxial myotome. While Raldh2 and Meis positively regulate each other, Raldh2 elimination largely recapitulates the defects associated to Meis-deficiency and Meis overexpression rescues the axial skeletal defects in Raldh2 mutants. We propose a Meis-RA positive feedback loop whose output is Meis levels and is essential to establish anterior-posterior identities and pattern of the vertebrate axial skeleton.",

    "abstract": "As a reaction-diffusion system strongly affected by temperature, the early fly embryos surprisingly show highly reproducible and accurate developmental patterns during embryogenesis under temperature perturbations. To reveal the underlying temperature compensation mechanism, it is important to overcome the challenge in quantitative imaging on fly embryos under temperature perturbations. Inspired by a microfluidics generating temperature steps on fly embryos, here we design a microfluidic device capable of ensuring the normal development of multiple fly embryos as well as achieving real-time temperature control and fast temperature jumps for quantitative live imaging with a home-built two-photon microscope. We apply this system to quantify the temperature compensation of the morphogen Bicoid (Bcd) gradient in fly embryos. The length constant of the exponential Bcd gradient reaches the maximum at 25 {degrees}C within the measured temperatures of 18-29 {degrees}C and gradually adapts to the corresponding value at new temperatures upon a fast temperature switch. Such an adaption decreases to a less degree if temperature is switched in a later developmental stage. This age-dependent temperature compensation could not be explained with the traditional synthesis-diffusion-degradation (SDD) model assuming the static parameters but an extended SDD model incorporating the dynamic change of the parameters controlling the formation of Bcd gradients.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThermal robustness is important for biological systems experiencing temperature fluctuations. To reveal the temperature compensation mechanism, the fruit fly embryo is an ideal model system. It is intriguing how the early fly embryo achieves highly reproducible and accurate patterning despite it is a reaction-diffusion system strongly affected by temperature. However, it has been challenging to quantitatively measure the developmental patterns in fly embryos under temperature perturbations. To overcome this problem, we construct a fast temperature tunable microfluidic device for fly embryos. Combining quantitative imaging with this device and mathematical modeling, we successfully quantify the temperature response of the morphogen Bicoid (Bcd) gradient and reveal that the temperature compensation for the Bcd gradient is stronger in the later developmental stage.",

    "abstract": "Competition from neighboring vegetation and browsing by large herbivores are two of the most important factors affecting the structure and dynamics of temperate forests. While the previous literature has been able to identify individual negative effects from competition or browsing, no one has yet identified and quantified both the individual and the joint effects. Still, when plants face both competition and browsing, it is possible that the combined effect is not simply a sum of the individual negative effects, but perhaps a more complicated situation, where plants perform either better (in case there is also a facilitative effect from the neighboring vegetation) or worse (if the effects amplify each other) than they would if experiencing only one of the two factors. In this paper, we focus on regeneration of oak (Quercus robur L) to study these questions. We analyze a rich data set from a large long-term field experiment conducted at multiple sites in mixed temperate forests in southern Sweden over almost a decade. By the use of four separate treatments on each site - (i) neither competition, nor browsing, (ii) only competition, (iii) only browsing, and (iv) both competition and browsing - we can identify and quantify both the individual and combined effects of competition and browsing on oak growth and survival. We find that both competition and browsing individually affect growth and survival negatively. For growth, browsing has the largest effect, while competition is the larger problem from a survival point of view. When the plant experiences both competition and browsing, the combined, negative, effect is larger than either individual effect for survival, but for growth, the relationship is more complicated, and the surrounding woody vegetation offers at least some protection for the oak, reducing the negative effects from browsing.",

    "abstract": "Natural environments, like soils or the mammalian gut, frequently contain microbial consortia competing within a niche, wherein many species contain genetic mechanisms of interspecies competition. Recent computational work suggests that physical structures in the environment can stabilize competition between species that would otherwise be subject to competitive exclusion under isotropic conditions. Here we employ Lotka-Volterra models to show that physical structure stabilizes large competitive ecological networks, even with significant differences in the strength of competitive interactions between species. We show that for stable communities the length-scale of physical structure inversely correlates with the width of the distribution of competitive fitness, such that physical environments with finer structure can sustain a broader spectrum of interspecific competition. These results highlight the generic stabilizing effects of physical structure on microbial communities and lay groundwork for engineering structures that stabilize and/or select for diverse communities of ecological, medical, or industrial utility.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYNatural environments often have many species competing for the same resources and frequently one species will out-compete others. This poses the fundamental question of how a diverse array of species can coexist in a resource limited environment. Among other mechanisms, previous studies examined how interactions between species - like cooperation or predation - could lead to stable biodiversity. In this work we looked at this question from a different angle: we used computational models to examine the role that the environment itself might play in stabilizing competing species. We modeled how species arrange themselves in space when the environment contains objects that alter the interfaces along which competing species meet. We found that these  structured environments stabilize species coexistence, across a range of density of those objects and in a way that was robust to differing strengths of interspecies competition. Thus, in addition to biological factors, our work presents a generic mechanism by which the environment itself can influence ecological outcomes and biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "The microbiota of four Antarctic sponges, Dendrilla antarctica, Sphaerotylus antarcticus, Mycale acerata, and Hemigellius pilosus, collected at two South Shetland Islands and at two locations in the Antarctic Peninsula separated by ca. 670 km, were analyzed together with surrounding seawater. We used high throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene common to Bacteria and Archaea to investigate the microbial diversity and community composition. Our study reveals that sponge-associated prokaryote communities are consistently detected within a particular sponge species regardless of the collection site. Their community structure and composition are typical of low microbial abundance (LMA) sponges. We conclude that prokaryote communities from Antarctic sponges are less diverse and differ in their composition compared to those in the water column. Microbiome analysis indicates that Antarctic sponges harbor a strict core consisting of seven OTUs, and a small variable community comprising several tens of OTUs. Two abundant prokaryotes from the variable microbiota that are affiliated to the archaeal and bacterial phyla Thaumarchaeota and Nitrospirae may be involved in the sponge nitrification process and might be relevant components of the nitrogen cycling in Antarctica. The likely generalist nature of dominant microbes and the host-specific structure of symbiont communities suggest that these Antarctic sponges represent different ecological niches for particular microbial enrichments.",

We distinguish groups of amino acid sites that undergo coordinated evolution and evolve discordantly from other such groups. In mitochondrially encoded proteins of metazoans and fungi, we show that concordantly evolving sites are clustered in protein structures. Moreover, the substitution rates within individual concordant groups themselves change in the course of evolution, and phylogenetic positions of these changes are consistent between proteins, suggesting common selective forces underlying them.\n\nAuthor summaryEvolution in most protein sites is constrained by alleles in other sites, this phenomena is called epistasis. Generally, newly arisen allele, if it would not be lost, increases its fitness with time due to adaptive mutations occurred in other sites in the process called the entrenchment. Thus, we expect that the evolution of sites would be coordinated, such that mutations in sites rapidly follow each other on phylogenetic lineages. Indeed, we have observed such coordinated evolution of sites in five proteins encoded in the mitochondria genomes of metazoan and fungi. Unexpectedly, coordinated evolution is observed only for nearby sites on protein structures, such that each protein could be partitioned into several groups of concordantly evolving sites. Evolution of sites from different groups is discordant, i.e. their mutations repel each other into different phylogenetic lineages or clades. Thus, the proteins encoded in mitochondrial genome consist of the sort of structural blocks like elements of the LEGO kit. Some of them have functional specialization, e.g. some blocks are associated with interfaces between proteins composing respiratory complexes.",

    "abstract": "Ancient DNA has allowed the study of various aspects of human history in unprecedented detail. However, because the majority of archaic human specimens preserved well enough for genome sequencing have been female, comprehensive studies of Y chromosomes of Denisovans and Neandertals have not yet been possible. Here we present sequences of the first Denisovan Y chromosomes (Denisova 4 and Denisova 8), as well as the Y chromosomes of three late Neandertals (Spy 94a, Mezmaiskaya 2 and El Sidron 1253). We find that the Denisovan Y chromosomes split around 700 thousand years ago (kya) from a lineage shared by Neandertal and modern human Y chromosomes, which diverged from each other around 370 kya. The phylogenetic relationships of archaic and modern human Y chromosomes therefore differ from population relationships inferred from their autosomal genomes, and mirror the relationships observed on the level of mitochondrial DNA. This provides strong evidence that gene flow from an early lineage related to modern humans resulted in the replacement of both the mitochondrial and Y chromosomal gene pools in late Neandertals. Although unlikely under neutrality, we show that this replacement is plausible if the low effective population size of Neandertals resulted in an increased genetic load in their Y chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA relative to modern humans.",

    "abstract": "Inclusive fitness theory has transformed the study of adaptive evolution since 1964, contributing to significant empirical findings. However, its status as a theory has been challenged by the proposals of several alternative frameworks. Those challenges have been countered by analyses that use the Price equation and the regression method. The Price equation is a universal description of evolutionary change, and the partitioning of the Price equation using the regression method immediately yields Hamiltons rule, which embodies the main tenets of inclusive fitness. Hamiltons rule captures the intensity and direction of selection acting on social behaviour and its underlying causal structure. Recent work, however, has suggested that there is an anomaly in this approach: in some cases, the regression method fails to estimate the correct values of the variables in Hamiltons rule and the causal structure of the behaviour. Here, I address this apparent anomaly. I argue that the failure of the simple regression method occurs because social players vary in baseline fecundity. I reformulate the Price equation and regression method to recover Hamiltons rule and I show that the method correctly estimates its key variables. I show that games where baseline fecundity varies among individuals represent a more general set of games that unfold in class-structured populations. This framework supports the robustness and validity of inclusive fitness.",

    "abstract": "Pleiotropy, the concept that a single gene controls multiple distinct traits, is prevalent in most organisms and has broad implications for medicine and agriculture. Identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying pleiotropy has the power to unveil previously unknown biological connections between seemingly unrelated traits. Additionally, the discovery of pleiotropic genes increases our understanding of both genetic and phenotypic complexity by characterizing novel gene functions. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping has been used to identify several pleiotropic regions in many organisms. However, gene knockout studies are needed to eliminate the possibility of tightly linked, non-pleiotropic loci. Here, we use a panel of 296 recombinant inbred advanced intercross lines of Caenorhabditis elegans and a high-throughput fitness assay to identify a single large-effect QTL on the center of chromosome V associated with variation in responses to eight chemotherapeutics. We validate this QTL with near-isogenic lines and pair genome-wide gene expression data with drug response traits to perform mediation analysis, leading to the identification of a pleiotropic candidate gene, scb-1. Using deletion strains created by genome editing, we show that scb-1, which was previously implicated in response to bleomycin, also underlies responses to other double-strand DNA break-inducing chemotherapeutics. This finding provides new evidence for the role of scb-1 in the nematode drug response and highlights the power of mediation analysis to identify causal genes.",

Here, double X-dosage shifts female pluripotent cells towards the naive stem cell state by increasing pluripotency factor expression, inhibiting the differentiation-promoting MAP kinase (MAPK) signalling pathway and delaying differentiation. To identify the genetic basis of these sex differences, we have performed a series of CRISPR knockout screens in murine embryonic stem cells to comprehensively identify X-linked genes that cause the female pluripotency phenotype. We found multiple genes that act in concert, among which Klhl13 plays a central role. We show that this E3 ubiquitin ligase substrate adaptor protein promotes pluripotency factor expression, delays differentiation and represses MAPK target genes, and we identify putative substrates. We thus elucidate the mechanisms that drive sex-induced differences in pluripotent cells with implications for gender medicine in the context of induced pluripotent stem cell based therapies.",

Here, we report the complete sequences of subtelomeric homologous (SH) regions of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. We overcame technical difficulties to obtain subtelomeric repetitive sequences by constructing strains that possess single SH regions. Whole sequences of SH regions revealed that each SH region consists of two distinct parts: the telomere-proximal part with mosaics of multiple common segments showing high variation among subtelomeres and strains, and the telomere-distal part showing high sequence similarity among subtelomeres with some insertions and deletions. The newly sequenced SH regions showed differences in nucleotide sequences and common segment composition compared to those in the S. pombe genome database (PomBase), which is in striking contrast to the regions outside of SH, where mutations are rarely detected. Furthermore, we identified new subtelomeric RecQ-type helicase genes, tlh3 and tlh4, which add to the already known tlh1 and tlh2, and found that the tlh1-4 genes show high sequence variation. Our results indicate that SH sequences are highly polymorphic and hot spots for genome variation. These features of subtelomeres may have contributed to genome diversity and, conversely, various diseases.",

    "abstract": "The controlled formation of sequence specific DNA protein complexes is a fundamental feature of most genetic transactions. Studies of the impact of point mutations on the function of individual components, such as repressors, remains a key aspect of many Systems and Synthetic Biology research programmes. One of the most dramatic systemic consequences of a point mutation is exhibited by the monomeric DNA methyltransferases M.HhaI and M.EcoRII, where substitution of a single, catalytic cysteine by either glycine or alanine, creates a lethal gain of function phenotype.\n\nIn vivo expression of these point mutants promotes the deposition of high affinity nucleoprotein complexes that arrest replication in vivo, causing cell death. Interestingly, it appears that a systemic response to expression of these mutant enzymes is dramatically enhanced when they are expressed as synthetic dimers. A previously unreported form of \"mutational rescue\" appears to be triggered as a result of networked crosslinking of host cell DNA resulting from an increased valency of nucleoprotein complex formation. This finding may have significance for developing molecular interventions for the controlled regulation of genome function and for the development of novel antimicrobial and anticancer strategies.",

    "abstract": "USP21, an E3 de-ubiquitin enzyme playing vital roles in physiological activities, is important for Treg cells to maintain immune homeostasis and control immune tolerance. To understand its diverse functions and potential mechanism is essential for disease development. We, using the USP21 gene-conditional knock-out mice model of Schistosoma Japonicum infection, found more cercariae developed into adults, and more eggs deposited in the liver in KO mice. However, immunohistochemistry showed the degree and the area of egg granuloma and liver fibrosis were both reduced. This suggested knock-out USP21 did affect the immunoregulation between schistosomes and the host. In KO mice the content of IFN-gamma and IL-4, and the expression of anti-SEA IgG and anti-SWAP IgG both increased in the liver, spleen and blood by flow cytometry, while the content of IL-10, lL-17A, IL-23, IL-9 and the expression of USP21 and anti-SEA IgM decreased. This indicated USP21-knockout-Tregs promoted both Th1-type and Th2-type immunity and inhibited other immunities during schistosomes infection, which disordered the host immunity. This study revealed the immunomodulatory of USP21 and preliminarily suggests it might be essential to regulate the complex immune network between the host and schistosomes. USP21 provides a new possible target for schistosomiasis treatment in the future.\n\nAuthor summarySchistosomiasis is a common neglected tropical disease that affects more than 230 million people worldwide. Therefore, the study on the mechanism of immune interaction between schistosomas and the host is not only helpful for the understanding of immune homeostasis, but also helpful for the further development of the treatment of schistosomiasis. Ubiquitin Specific Protease 21(USP21) has been shown to be involved in the regulation of many biological processes, such as maintaining immune homeostasis and regulating cell growth. Here, we observed that the specific deletion of USP21 led to the decrease of mices ability to resist schistosomes infection and promoted the survival of schistosomes. It was also proved that unstable regulatory T cells would produce polarization phenomenon and promote differentiation to helper T cells, which would lead to disorder of immune response in mice. However, this process reduced the serious immune pathological damage caused by egg granuloma. Our findings reveal that USP21 may be an important molecule regulating immune interaction between Schistosoma japonicum and the host.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAvian pox is a viral disease documented in a wide range of bird species. Disease related detrimental effects can cause dyspnea and dysphagia, therefore birds with high metabolic requirements, such as hummingbirds, are especially vulnerable. Hummingbirds have a strong presence in California, especially in urban environments; however, little is understood regarding the impact of pox virus on hummingbird populations. Diagnosing pox infections relies on obtaining a tissue biopsy that poses significant bird risks and field challenges. Understanding the ecology of hummingbird pox viral infections could be advanced by a minimally invasive ante-mortem diagnostic method. This studys goal was to address this gap in understanding if pox infections can be diagnosed using integumentary system samples besides tissue biopsies. To meet this goal, we tested multiple integumentary sample types and tested them using a quantitative real-time PCR assay. A secondary study goal was to determine which sample types (ranging from minimally to highly invasive sampling) were optimal for identifying infected birds.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsLesion tissue, pectoral muscle, feathers, toenail, blood, and swabs (both lesion tissue and non-lesion tissues) were taken from live birds and carcasses of two species of hummingbirds found in California. To maximize successful diagnosis, especially for samples with low viral load, a real-time quantitative PCR assay was developed for detecting the hummingbird-specific Avipoxvirus 4b core protein gene. Avipoxvirus DNA was successfully amplified from all sample types across 27 individuals. Our results were then compared to those of conventional PCR. Comparisons were also made between sample types utilizing lesion tissue samples as the gold standard.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceHummingbird avian pox can be diagnosed without relying on tissue biopsies. Feather samples can be used for diagnosing infected birds and reduces sampling risk. A real-time PCR assay detected viral DNA in various integumentary system sample types and could be used for studying hummingbird disease ecology in the future.",

    "abstract": "The Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of 22 closely related opportunistic pathogens which produce a wide range of bioactive secondary metabolites with great biotechnological potential, for example in biocontrol and bioremediation.\n\nThis study aimed to investigate methylation in the Bcc by SMRT sequencing, and to determine the impact of restriction-methylation (RM) systems on genome protection and stability and on phenotypic traits. We constructed and analysed a mutant lacking all RM components in the clinical isolate B. cenocepacia H111. We show that a previously identified essential gene of strain H111, gp51, encoding a methylase within a prophage region, is required for maintaining the bacteriophage in a lysogenic state. We speculate that epigenetic modification of a phage promoter provides a mechanism for a constant, low level of phage production within the bacterial population. We also found that, in addition to bacteriophage induction, methylation was important in biofilm formation, cell shape, motility, siderophore production and membrane vesicle production. Moreover, we found that DNA methylation had a massive effect on the maintenance of the smallest replicon present in this bacterium, which is essential for its virulence.\n\nIn silico investigation revealed the presence of two core RM systems, present throughout the Bcc and beyond, suggesting that the acquisition of these RM systems occurred prior to the phylogenetic separation of the Bcc. We used SMRT sequencing of single mutants to experimentally assign the B. cenocepacia H111 methylases to their cognate motifs. Analysis of the distribution of methylation patterns suggested roles for m6A methylation in replication, since motifs recognised by the core Type III RM system were more abundant at the replication origins of the three H111 replicons, and in regions encoding functions related to cell motility and iron uptake.\n\nAuthor summaryWhile nucleotide sequence determines an organisms proteins, methylation of the nucleotides themselves can confer additional properties. In bacteria, methyltransferases methylate specific motifs to allow discrimination of  self from  non-self DNA, e.g. from bacteriophages. Restriction enzymes detect  non-self methylation patterns and cut foreign DNA. Furthermore, methylation of promoter regions can influence gene expression and hence affect phenotype. In this study, we determined the methylated motifs of four strains from the Burkholderia cepacia complex of opportunistic pathogens. Three novel motifs were found, and two that were previously identified in a related species. We deleted the genes encoding the restriction and modification components in a representative strain from among the four sequenced. In this study, methylation is shown to affect various phenotypes, among which maintenance of the lysogenic state of a phage and segregational stability of the smallest megareplicon are most remarkable.",

    "abstract": "Weatherization of residential homes is a popular retrofit procedure to improve the energy efficiency of older homes by reducing building leakage. It is a vital tool in the fight against climate change. Several studies have evaluated the effect of weatherization on indoor pollutants such as formaldehyde and radon, but few studies have evaluated the effect of weatherization on indoor particulates and microbial exposure. In this study, we compared the effect of change in building leakage on indoor pollutants and bacterial communities in weatherized compared to non-weatherized single-family residential homes in New York State. Nine weatherized and eleven non-weatherized single-family homes in Tompkins County, New York were sampled twice: before and after the weatherization procedures for case homes, and at least 3 months apart for control homes that were not weatherized. We found a significant increase in both indoor-outdoor temperature ratio and living-area- and basement-radon levels of weatherized homes compared to control homes. The indoor-outdoor relative humidity ratio significantly decreased in weatherized compared to control homes. The indoor microbiome also became less similar to the outdoor community after weatherization. Compared to the changes in ventilation rate, temperature, relative humidity, and occupancy, the change in season was a more predictive measure of indoor bacterial concentration. Ventilation rate reduction from weatherization procedures led to an increase in indoor radon levels, as well as a warmer and less humid indoor environment. However, it did not affect indoor particulate mass concentration or indoor airborne bacteria load, and did only marginally affect the microbiome composition of residential homes. Finally, we found that changes in airborne bacterial load are more sensitive to shifts in season, whereas radon levels are more sensitive to ventilation rate.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial property of extract derived from a part of the Jackfruit called  rag, that is generally considered as fruit waste. Morpho-physical characterization of the Jackfruit rag extract (JFRE) was performed using gas-chromatography, where peaks indicative of furfural; pentanoic acid; and hexadecanoic acid were observed. In vitro biocompatibility of JFRE was performed using the MTT assay, which showed comparable cellular viability between extract-treated and untreated mouse fibroblast cells. Agar well disc diffusion assay exhibited JFRE induced zones of inhibition for a wide variety of laboratory and clinical strains of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Analysis of electron microscope images of bacterial cells suggests that JFRE induces cell death by disintegration of the bacterial cell wall and precipitating intracytoplasmic clumping. The antibacterial activity of the JFREs was further validated in vivo using Shigella dysenteriae infected fly model, where JFRE pre-fed flies infected with S. dysenteriae had significantly reduced mortality compared to controls. JFRE demonstrates broad antibacterial property, both in vitro and in vivo, possibly by its activity on bacterial cell wall. This study highlights the importance of exploring alternative sources of antibacterial compounds, especially from plant-derived waste, that could provide economical and effective solutions to current challenges in antimicrobial therapy.",

    "abstract": "The crucial transmission phase of tuberculosis (TB) relies on infectious sputum yet cannot easily be modeled. We applied one-step RNA-Sequencing to sputum from infectious TB patients to investigate the host and microbial environments underlying transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In such TB sputa, compared to non-TB controls, transcriptional upregulation of inflammatory responses and a metabolic shift towards glycolysis was observed in the host. Amongst all bacterial sequences in the sputum, only less than 1.5% originated from Mtb and its abundance is associated with HIV-1 coinfection status. The transcriptome of sputum Mtb more closely resembled aerobic replication and was characterized by evidence of cholesterol utilization, zinc deprivation and reduced expression of the virulence-associated PhoP regulon. Our study provides a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptional landscape associated with infectious sputum and demonstrates the feasibility of applying advanced sequencing technology to readily accessible pathological specimens in the study of host-pathogen adaptation.",

    "abstract": "This study isolated a novel halotolerant Pseudomonas aeruginosa M4, that was able to degrade oil and produce rhamnolipids. Various carbon sources, nitrogen sources, inoculum ratio, pH, and temperature were tested to optimize the oil degradation conditions. The highest oil degradation rate of 85.20 % and lipase activity of 23.86 U/mL were obtained under the optimal conditions (5% inoculum at 35 {degrees}C and pH 8). The components of degradation products at different times were analyzed to explore the mechanism of oil degradation by GC-MS. Short chain fatty acid of acetic and n-butyric acids were the primary degradation intermediates. P. aeruginosa M4 had good salt tolerance up to 70 g/L. The maximum rhamnolipid concentration of 1119.87 mg/L was produced when P. aeruginosa M4 used waste cooking oil as the sole carbon source. Rhamnose precursors were synthesized from glycerol, a hydrolysis product of waste cooking oil. R-3-hydroxyalkanoate precursors were synthesized de novo using acetyl-CoA produced from {beta}-oxidation of fatty acids. The findings show that P. aeruginosa M4 is a valuable biosurfactant producer in the treatment of waste cooking oil.\n\nKey PointsP. aeruginosa isolation, oil degradation mechanism, rhamnolipid production from WCO",

    "abstract": "Bordetella pertussis is the causative agent of pertussis (whooping cough), a contagious respiratory disease that has recently seen a resurgence despite high vaccination coverage, necessitating improvement of current pertussis vaccines. An autotransporter of B. pertussis, virulence-associated gene 8 (Vag8), has been proposed as an additional component to improve pertussis vaccines. Vag8 is known to play a role in evasion of the complement system and activation of the contact system by inactivating the complement regulating factor, C1 inhibitor (C1 Inh), which inhibits serine proteases, such as plasma kallikrein (PK). However, the nature of the molecular interaction between Vag8 and C1 Inh remains to be determined. In the present study, we attempted to determine the minimum region of Vag8 that interacts with C1 Inh by examining the differently-truncated Vag8 derivatives for the ability to bind and inactivate C1 Inh. The region of Vag8 from amino-acid residues 102 to 548 was found to bind C1 Inh and cancel its inhibitory action on the protease activity of PK at the same level as a Vag8 fragment from amino-acid residues 52 to 648 covering the passenger domain, which carries its extracellular function. In contrast, the truncated Vag8 containing amino-acid residues 102 - 479 or 202 - 648 barely interacted with C1 Inh. These results indicated that the two separate regions of amino-acid residues 102 - 202 and 479 - 548 are likely required for the interaction with C1 Inh.\n\nImportancePertussis is currently reemerging worldwide, and is still one of the greatest disease burdens in infants. B. pertussis produces a number of virulence factors, including toxins, adhesins, and autotransporters. One of the autotransporters, Vag8, which binds and inactivates the complement regulator C1 Inh, is considered to contribute to the establishment of B. pertussis infection. However, the nature of the interaction between Vag8 and C1 Inh remains to be explored. In this study, we narrowed down the region of Vag8 that interacts with C1 Inh and demonstrated that at least two separate regions of Vag8 are necessary for the interaction with C1 Inh. Our results provide insight into the structure-function relationship of the Vag8 molecule and information to determine its potential role in the pathogenesis of B. pertussis.",

This has led to the recent clinical deployment of new serine {beta}-lactamase inhibitors used in combination with {beta}-lactams. Starting with clinical K. pneumoniae isolates and adding plasmids carrying the OXA-48-like class D carbapenemase, OXA-232, the class A carbapenemase KPC-3, the class A cephalosporinase CTX-M-14 and mutant derivatives of these enzymes, we set out to identify the steps required to give resistance to the recently approved {beta}-lactam/{beta}-lactamase inhibitor pairs ceftazidime/avibactam and meropenem/vaborbactam when both are used together. We show that four steps: ompK36 and ramR loss-of-function plus carriage of OXA-232 and KPC-3-D178Y, all of which have been observed in clinical isolates, allow K. pneumoniae to resist the combined use of both {beta}-lactam/{beta}-lactamase inhibitor pairs. These findings have implications for decision making about sequential and combinatorial use of {beta}-lactam/{beta}-lactamase inhibitor pairs to treat K. pneumoniae infections, and suggest simple surveillance activities that might identify intermediate stages in resistance acquisition and therefore guide therapy to reduce the emergence of dual resistant strains.",

MRSA have been adapted to antibiotics so that they can block the access of antibiotics physically or chemically deactivate it or modify the precursor of the target. Flavonoids are secondary metabolites which are naturally produced by plant or fungus and they are acting generally as pigment, quorum sensing molecules, antibiotics to other competitive microorganisms. Their natural origins and multiple activities have drawn much attention to be developed as the potential drugs since flavonoids could be a good candidate to overcome antibiotic resistant bacteria. Among various flavonoids, we found out naringenin has antibacterial activity on MRSA and {Delta}agr mutants which are more resistance than MRSA to beta-lactam antibiotics by decreasing biofilm formation dramatically and decreasing the secretion of fatty acid. It also showed high synergetic activity with oxacillin to both antibacterial activity and biofilm inhibition. Considering the number of flavonoids, our experiments expand the possibility of the use of flavonoids to MRSA.",

    "abstract": "Nuclear compartments play diverse roles in regulating gene expression, yet the molecular forces and components driving compartment formation are not well understood. Studying how the lncRNA Xist establishes the inactive-X-chromosome (Xi)-compartment, we found that the Xist RNA-binding-proteins PTBP1, MATR3, TDP43, and CELF1 form a condensate to create an Xi-domain that can be sustained in the absence of Xist. The E-repeat-sequence of Xist serves a multivalent binding-platform for these proteins. Without the E-repeat, Xist initially coats the X-chromosome during XCI onset but subsequently disperses across the nucleus with loss of gene silencing. Recruitment of PTBP1, MATR3, TDP-43 or CELF1 to {Delta}E-Xist rescues these phenotypes, and requires both self-association of MATR3 and TDP-43 and a heterotypic PTBP1-MATR3-interaction. Together, our data reveal that Xist sequesters itself within the Xi-territory and perpetuates gene silencing by seeding a protein-condensate. Our findings uncover an unanticipated mechanism for epigenetic memory and elucidate the interplay between RNA and RNA-binding-proteins in creating compartments for gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a structurally and functionally conserved transmembrane protein whose physiological role in adult brain function and health is still unclear. Because mutations in APP cause familial Alzheimers disease, most research focuses on this aspect of APP biology. We investigated the physiological function of APP in the adult brain using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which harbors a single APP homologue called APP Like (APPL). Previous studies have provided evidence for the implication of APPL in neuronal wiring and axonal growth through the Wnt signaling pathway. However, like APP, APPL continues to be expressed in all neurons of the adult brain where its functions and their molecular and cellular underpinnings are unknown. We report that APPL loss of function results in the dysregulation of endolysosomal function, in both neurons and glia, with a notable enlargement of early endosomal compartment in neurons followed by neuronal cell death, the accumulation of dead neurons in the brain during a critical period at a young age and subsequent reduction in lifespan. These defects can be rescued by reduction in the levels of the early endosomal regulator Rab5, indicating a causal role of endosomal function for cell death. Finally, we show that the secreted extracellular domain of APPL is taken up by glia, regulates their endosomal morphology and this is necessary and sufficient for the clearance of neuronal debris in an axotomy model. We propose that the APP proteins represent a novel family of neuro-glial signaling proteins required for adult brain homeostasis.",

In the present work we simulated the exact shape of a real rat whisker to demonstrate the existence of a unique mapping from triplets of mechanical signals at the whisker base to the three-dimensional whisker-object contact point. We then used high speed video to record whisker deflections as an awake rat whisked against a peg and used the mechanics resulting from those deflections to extract the contact points along the peg surface. A video shows the contour of the peg gradually emerging during active whisking behavior.",

Oculomotor dysfunction (OMD) is an umbrella term that includes abnormalities in comfortable and accurate control of the oculomotor system (fixation, pursuits and saccades) and can exist despite normal dVA. Since we assumed that a basic prerequisite for successful reading is that the ocular sensory-motor functions perform in flawless harmony with effortless automaticity, we hypothesized that OMD but not dVA would have profound effect on comfortable and efficient acquisition of effective reading skills. Consequently, we retrospectively compared independently obtained (double blind) reading evaluations and extensive optometric screening examinations of a class of 28 first graders. We found, as we hypothesized, that performance on optometric oculomotor tests, but not dVA, were predictive of reading test performance (both speed and accuracy) according to the standardized national reading norms. Our results suggest reevaluating the effectiveness of dVA as a marker of visual readiness for scholastic achievements. We propose including OMD related assessments as part of a paradigm shift in both vision screening in early readers as well as potential treatment protocols for those pupils struggling to acquire efficient reading skills.",

TMS is widely used for studying the mechanisms underlying perception and behaviour and is considered a potential therapeutic technique for various conditions. However, the application of TMS has been hindered by the lack of understanding of its mechanism of action. Here we studied the effects of three repetitive TMS (rTMS) paradigms on intra-cortical neuronal responses to oriented gratings in cat area 18. Each of stimulation protocols, including continuous theta-burst, intermittent theta-burst, and 15 Hz rTMS, consisted of 600 pulses. Application of continuous theta-burst and 15 Hz rTMS suppressed the action potential response to oriented grating stimuli for 1.5-6 minutes. In contrast, application of intermittent theta-burst stimulation was associated with enhancement of the action potential response [~]15 minutes following TMS. Neuronal assemblies that were more responsive before the application of rTMS, were affected more than neurons that were less responsive before rTMS. In spite of these changes, the preferred orientation, the orientation tuning of the multi-unit activity and the spatial pattern of the responses recorded from assemblies neurons remained unaffected. Our findings demonstrate that rTMS does not modify the functional selectivities of ensembles of neurons; rather, it has a linear gain effect on their responses.",

    "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5), an X-linked gene encoding a serine-threonine kinase, is enriched in the mammalian forebrain and critical for neuronal maturation and synaptic function. Mutations in this gene cause CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) that is characterized by early-onset epileptic seizures, autistic behaviors and intellectual disability. Although numerous CDD symptoms have been recapitulated in mouse models, spontaneous seizures have not been reported in mice with CDKL5 deficiency. Here, we present the first systematic study of spontaneous seizures in a mouse model of CDD. Through wireless electroencephalographic (EEG) recording and simultaneous videotaping, we observed epileptiform discharges accompanied with ictal behaviors in pups lacking CDKL5 at a selective time window during the pre-weaning period. The seizure-like patterns of EEG showed robust increase in total number of spike events, the total number and duration of bursts in Cdkl5 null pups compared to wild-type littermate controls at the age of postnatal day 12 (P12). The mutants displayed not only jerky and spasm-like movements during the prolonged bursts of discharges at P12, but also strengthened ictal grasping in both juvenile stage and adulthood. In addition, loss of CDKL5 remarkably reduced the phosphorylation of K+/Cl- co-transporter 2, which may impede GABA-mediated inhibition, in the cortex of P12 mouse pups. Our study reveals previously unidentified phenotypes of early-onset seizures in CDKL5-deficient mice, highlights the translational value of mouse models of CDD and provides a potential molecular target for early diagnosis and treatment for CDD.\n\nSignificance StatementCyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) is an X-linked gene encoding a serine-threonine kinase. Mutations in this gene cause CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), a rare disease characterized by developmental delays, autistic behaviors and early-onset epilepsy. Even though many symptoms of CDD patients have been phenocopied in mice, spontaneous seizures are yet to be reported in mouse models of CDD. Here, for the first time, we identified early-onset seizures and ictal behaviors in neonatal pups of CDKL5-deficient mice. Loss of CDKL5 also selectively reduced protein levels of phosphorylated K+/Cl-cotransporter 2 in neonatal cortex of mice.

    "abstract": "Legumes play a pivotal role in combating the chronic hunger and malnutrition in the developing nations and are also ideal crops to achieve global food and nutrition security. In the era of climate change, erratic rainfalls, depleting arable land and water resource, feeding the rapidly growing population is a challenging task. Like most other pulses, cowpea is a self pollinated, nutritious, versatile and widely adapted grain legume, but harbor a little accessible genetic variability. Lack of sufficient genetic variability and small size of flowers, traditional plant breeding methods are not enough to meet the demands of improvement of cowpea. Hence, induced mutagenesis was employed to induce significant genetic variability across a range of agro-economical traits in two cowpea varieties Gomati VU-89 and Pusa- 578 from M1 to M4 generations. The success of induced mutagenesis largely depends on the selection of appropriate mutagen, its dose, effectiveness and efficiency. Hence present study was conduct to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of single and combined doses of sodium azide and gamma rays to set an appropriate protocol for induced mutagenesis experimentation in cowpea.",

    "abstract": "Proteome remodeling is a fundamental adaptive response and proteins in complex and functionally related proteins are often co-expressed. Using a deep sampling strategy we define Arabidopsis thaliana tissue core proteomes at around 10,000 proteins per tissue and absolutely quantify (copy numbers per cell) nearly 16,000 proteins throughout the plant lifecycle. A proteome wide survey of global post translational modification revealed amino acid exchanges pointing to potential conservation of translational infidelity in eukaryotes. Correlation analysis of protein abundance uncovered potentially new tissue and age specific roles of entire signaling modules regulating transcription in photosynthesis, seed development and senescence and abscission. Among others, the data suggest a potential function of RD26 and other NAC transcription factors in seed development related to desiccation tolerance as well as a possible function of Cysteine-rich Receptor-like Kinases (CRKs) as ROS sensors in senescence. All of the components of ribosome biogenesis factor (RBF) complexes were co-expressed tissue and age specifically indicating functional promiscuity in the assembly of these little described protein complexes in Arabidopsis. Treatment of seedlings with flg22 for 16 hours allowed us to characterize proteome architecture in basal immunity in detail. The results were complemented with parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) targeted proteomics, phytohormone, amino acid and transcript measurements. We obtained strong evidence of suppression of jasmonate (JA) and JA-Ile levels by deconjugation and hydroxylation via IAA-ALA RESISTANT3 (IAR3) and JASMONATE-INDUCED OXYGENASE 2 (JOX2) under the control of JASMONATE INSENSITIVE 1 (MYC2). This previously unknown regulatory switch is another part of the puzzle of the as yet understudied role of JA in pattern triggered immunity. The extensive coverage of the Arabidopsis proteome in various biological scenarios presents a rich resource to plant biologists that we make available to the community.",

    "abstract": "In angiosperms, the process of pollination relies on species-specific interaction and signaling between the male (pollen) and female (pistil) counterparts where the interplay between several pollen and stigma proteins decides the fate of the pollen. In Brassicaceae, the dry stigmatic papillary cells control pollen germination by releasing resources only to compatible pollen thereby allowing pollen to hydrate and germinate. Despite the identification of a number of stigmatic proteins that facilitate pollination responses, the signaling mechanisms that regulate functions of these proteins have remained unknown. Here we show that, in Arabidopsis, an extremely functionally redundant mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is required for maintaining stigma receptivity to accept compatible pollen. Our genetic analyses demonstrate that in stigmas, five MAPK kinases (MKKs), MKK1/2/3/7/9 are required to transmit upstream signals to two MPKs, MPK3/4, to mediate compatible pollination. Compromised functions of these five MKKs in the quintuple mutant (mkk1/2/3RNAi/mkk7/9) phenocopied pollination defects observed in the mpk4RNAi/mpk3 double mutant. We further show that this MAPK nexus converges on Exo70A1, a previously identified stigmatic compatibility factor essential for pollination. Given that pollination is the crucial initial step during plant reproduction, understanding the mechanisms that govern successful pollination could lead to development of strategies to improve crop yield.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionAs biomedical research becomes more data-intensive, computational reproducibility is a growing area of importance. Unfortunately, many biomedical researchers have not received formal computational training and often struggle to produce results that can be reproduced using the same data, code, and methods. Programming workshops can be a tool to teach new computational methods, but it is not always clear whether researchers are able to use their new skills to make their work more computationally reproducible.\n\nMethodsThis mixed methods study consisted of in-depth interviews with 14 biomedical researchers before and after participation in an introductory programming workshop. During the interviews, participants described their research workflows and responded to a quantitative checklist measuring reproducible behaviors. The interview data was analyzed using a thematic analysis approach, and the pre and post workshop checklist scores were compared to assess the impact of the workshop on computational reproducibility of the researchers workflows.\n\nResultsPre and post scores on a checklist of reproducible behaviors did not increase in a statistically significant manner. The qualitative interviews revealed that several participants had made small changes to their workflows including switching to open source programming languages for their data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. Overall many of the participants indicated higher levels of programming literacy and an interest in further training. Factors that enabled change included supportive environments and an immediate research need, while barriers included collaborators that were resistant to new tools and a lack of time.\n\nConclusionWhile none of the participants completely changed their workflows, many of them did incorporate new practices, tools, or methods that helped make their work more reproducible and transparent to other researchers. This indicate that programming workshops now offered by libraries and other organizations contribute to computational reproducibility training for researchers",

    "abstract": "AbstractOxidative stress alters cell viability, from microorganism irradiation sensitivity to human aging and neurodegeneration. Deleterious effects of protein carbonylation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) make understanding molecular properties determining ROS-susceptibility essential. The radiation-resistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans accumulates less carbonylation than sensitive organisms, making it a key model for deciphering properties governing oxidative stress resistance. We integrated shotgun redox proteomics, structural systems biology, and machine learning to resolve properties determining protein damage by {gamma}-irradiation in Escherichia coli and D. radiodurans at multiple scales. Local accessibility, charge, and lysine enrichment accurately predict ROS-susceptibility. Lysine, methionine, and cysteine usage also contribute to ROS-resistance of the D. radiodurans proteome. Our model predicts proteome maintenance machinery and proteins protecting against ROS are more resistant in D. radiodurans. Our findings substantiate that protein-intrinsic protection impacts oxidative stress resistance, identifying causal molecular properties.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryProteins differ in intrinsic susceptibility to oxidation, a mode of evolutionary adaptation for stress tolerance in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Protein degradation is mediated by an expansive and complex network of protein modification and degradation enzymes. Matching degradation enzymes with their targets and determining globally which proteins are degraded by the proteasome or lysosome/vacuole has been a major challenge. Further, an integrated view of protein degradation for cellular pathways has been lacking. Here we present a novel analytical platform that combines systematic gene deletions with quantitative measures of protein turnover to deconvolve protein degradation pathways for S. cerevisiae. The resulting turnover map (T-MAP) reveals target candidates of nearly all E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligases and identifies the primary degradation routes for most proteins. We further mined this T-MAP to identify new substrates of ER-associated Degradation (ERAD) involved in sterol biosynthesis and to uncover novel regulatory nodes for sphingolipid biosynthesis. The T-MAP approach should be broadly applicable to the study of other cellular processes and systems, including mammalian systems.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA systematic, global map of protein turnover for a large set of yeast mutants reveals scope and specificity of degradation pathways and identifies novel regulatory nodes for lipid metabolism.",
