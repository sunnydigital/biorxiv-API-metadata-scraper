    "abstract": "It is said that the quality of a scientific publication is as good as the science it cites, but the properties of high-quality reference lists have never been numerically quantified. We examined seven numerical characteristics of reference lists of 50,878 primary research articles published in 17 ecological journals between 1997 and 2017. Over this 20-years period, there have been significant changes in reference lists\u2019 properties. On average, more recent ecological papers have longer reference lists, cite more high Impact Factor papers, and fewer non-journal publications. Furthermore, we show that highly cited papers across the ecology literature have longer reference lists, cite more recent and impactful papers, and account for more self-citations. Conversely, the proportion of \u2018classic\u2019 papers and non-journal publications cited, as well as the temporal range of the reference list, have no significant influence on articles\u2019 citations. From this analysis, we distill a recipe for crafting impactful reference lists.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Copy number variation is crucial in deciphering the mechanism and cure of complex disorders and cancers. The recent advancement of scDNA sequencing technology sheds light upon addressing intratumor heterogeneity, detecting rare subclones, and reconstructing tumor evolution lineages at single-cell resolution. Nevertheless, the current circular binary segmentation based approach proves to fail to efficiently and effectively identify copy number shifts on some exceptional trails. Here, we propose SCYN, a CNV segmentation method powered with dynamic programming. SCYN resolves the precise segmentation on two in silico datasets. Then we verified SCYN manifested accurate copy number inferring on triple negative breast cancer scDNA data, with array comparative genomic hybridization results of purified bulk samples as ground truth validation. We tested SCYN on two datasets of the newly emerged 10x Genomics CNV solution. SCYN successfully recognizes gastric cancer cells from 1% and 10% spike-ins 10x datasets. Moreover, SCYN is about 150 times faster than state of the art tool when dealing with the datasets of approximately 2000 cells. SCYN robustly and efficiently detects segmentations and infers copy number profiles on single cell DNA sequencing data. It serves to reveal the tumor intra-heterogeneity. The source code of SCYN can be accessed in https://github.com/xikanfeng2/SCYN. The visualization tools are hosted on https://sc.deepomics.org/.",

    "abstract": "Batch inconsistency is a major problem when applying LC-MS based untargeted metabolomics in real-time analysis situation such as clinical diagnosis or health monitoring. And inefficiency of collecting MS2 is a major problem for metabolite identification. Here, we developed a reference-feature based quantification and identification strategy (RFQI). In RFQI, samples are individually profiled using a pre-fixed reference feature table. Quantification results show that RFQI improves features overlap rate and reduce variance across batches significantly in real-time-analysis mode, and can find more than 4-fold numbers of features. Besides, RFQI collects MS2 from consecutive increasing samples for metabolite identification of pre-fixed features, thus it can effectively compensate for the poor efficiency of MS2 collection in data-dependent acquisition mode. In summary, RFQI can make full advantage of consecutive increasing samples in real-time analysis situation, both for quantification and identification.",

    "abstract": "Unsupervised methods, such as clustering methods, are essential to the analysis of single-cell genomic data. Most current clustering methods are designed for one data type only, such as scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq or sc-methylation data alone, and a few are developed for the integrative analysis of multiple data types. Integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell genomic data sets leverages the power in multiple data sets and can deepen the biological insight. We propose a coupled co-clustering-based unsupervised transfer learning algorithm (coupleCoC) for the integrative analysis of multimodal single-cell data. Our proposed coupleCoC builds upon the information theoretic co-clustering framework. We applied coupleCoC for the integrative analysis of scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq data, sc-methylation and scRNA-seq data, and scRNA-seq data from mouse and human. We demonstrate that coupleCoC improves the overall clustering performance and matches the cell subpopulations across multimodal single-cell genomic data sets.

    "abstract": "The unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated in pancreatic pathologies and suggested as a target for therapeutic intervention. In this study, wxe examined Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3), a mediator of the UPR which promotes acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) in response to pancreatic injury. Since ADM is an initial step in the progression to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), we hypothesized ATF3 is required for initiation and progression of PDAC. We generated mice carrying a germ line mutation of Atf3 (Atf3-/-) combined with acinar-specific induction of oncogenic KRAS (Ptf1acreERT/+KrasLSL-G12D). Atf3-/- mice with (termed APK) and without KRASG12D were exposed to cerulein-induced pancreatitis. In response to recurrent pancreatitis, Atf3-/- mice showed decreased ADM and enhanced regeneration based on morphological and biochemical analysis. Similarly, an absence of ATF3 reduced spontaneous pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia formation and PDAC in Ptf1acreERT/+KrasLSL-G12D mice. In response to injury, KRASG12D bipassed the requirement for ATF3 with a dramatic loss in acinar tissue and PanIN formation observed regardless of ATF3 status. However, unlike Ptf1acreERT/+KrasLSL-G12D mice, APK mice exhibited a cachexia-like phenotype, did not progress through to PDAC, and showed altered pancreatic fibrosis and immune cell infiltration. These findings suggest a complex, multifaceted role for ATF3 in pancreatic cancer pathology.",

    "abstract": "Identifying when and where environmental change induces molecular responses in natural populations is an important goal in contemporary ecology. It can aid in identifying molecular signatures of populations experiencing stressful conditions and potentially inform if species are approaching the limits of their tolerance niches. Achieving this goal is hampered by our limited understanding of the influence of environmental variation on the molecular systems of most ecologically relevant species as the pathways underlying fitness-affecting plastic responses have primarily been studied in model organisms under controlled laboratory conditions. In this study, we establish relationships between protein abundance patterns and the abiotic environment by profiling the proteomes of 24 natural populations of the caddisfly Crunoecia irrorata. We subsequently relate these profiles to natural variations in the abiotic characteristics of their freshwater spring habitats which shows that protein abundances and networks respond to abiotic variation according to the functional roles these proteins have. We provide evidence that geographic and past and present environmental differences between sites affect protein abundances and identifications, and that baseline reaction norms are ubiquitous and can be used as information rather than noise in comparative field studies. Taking this natural variation into account is a prerequisite if we are to identify the effects environmental change has on natural populations.",

    "abstract": "The application of current genome-wide sequencing techniques on human populations helps elucidate the considerable gene flow among genus Homo, which includes modern and archaic humans. Gene flow among current human populations has been studied using frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Unlike single nucleotide polymorphism frequency data, haplotype data are suitable for identifying and tracing rare evolutionary events. Haplotype data can also conveniently detect genomic location and estimate molecular function that may be a target of selection. We analyzed eight loci of the human genome using the same procedure for each locus to infer human haplotype diversity and reevaluate past explanations of the evolutionary mechanisms that affected these loci. These loci have been recognized by separate studies because of their unusual gene genealogy and geographic distributions that are inconsistent with the recent out-of-Africa model. For each locus, we constructed genealogies for haplotypes using sequence data of the 1000 Genomes Project. Then, we performed S* analysis to estimate distinct gene flow events other than out-of-Africa events. Furthermore, we also estimated unevenness of selective pressure between haplotypes by Extended Haplotype Homozygosity analysis. Based on the patterns of results obtained by this combination of analyses, we classified the examined loci without using a specific population model. This simple method helped clarify evolutionary events for each locus, including rare evolutionary events such as introgression, incomplete lineage sorting, selection, and haplotype recombination that may be hard to discriminate from each other.",

    "abstract": "Drought has long been established as a major environmental stress for plants which have in turn developed several coping strategies, ranging from physiological to molecular mechanisms. LP3; a homolog of the Abscisic Acid, Stress and Ripening (ASR) gene was first detected in tomato; and has been shown to be present in four different isoforms in loblolly pine called LP3-0, LP3-1, LP3-2 and LP3-3. While ASR has already been extensively studied notably in tomato, the same cannot be said of LP3. Like ASR, the different LP3 isoforms have been shown to be upregulated in response to water deficit stress and to also act as transcription factors for genes likely involved in hexose transport. In this study we have investigated the evolutionary history of LP3 gene family, with the aim of relating it to that of ASR from a phylogenetic perspective and comparing the differences in selective pressure and codon usage. Phylogenetic analyses of different LP3 homologs compared to ASR show that LP3 is less divergent across species than ASR and that even when comparing the different sub-sections of the gene the divergence rate of LP3 is lower than that of ASR. Analysis of different gene parameters showed that there were differences in GC1% and GC2% but not in total or GC3% content. All genes had a relatively high CAI value associated with a low to moderate ENC value, which is indicative of high translation efficiency found in highly expressed genes. Analysis of codon usage also showed that LP3 preferentially uses different codons than ASR. Selective pressure analysis across most of the LP3 and ASR genes used in this study showed that these genes were principally undergoing purifying selection, with the exception of LP3-3 which seems to be undergoing diversifying selection most probably due to the fact that it likely recently diverged from LP3-0. This study thus provides insight in how ASR and LP3 have diverged from each other while remaining homologous.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNumerous large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been performed to understand the genetic factors of numerous traits, including type 2 diabetes. Many identified risk loci are located in non-coding and intergenic regions, which complicates the understanding how genes and their downstream pathways are influenced. An integrative data approach is required to understand the mechanism and consequences of identified risk loci.\n\nResultsHere, we developed the R-package CONQUER. Data for SNPs of interest (build GRCh38/hg38) were acquired from static- and dynamic repositories, such as, GTExPortal, Epigenomics Project, 4D genome database and genome browsers such as ENSEMBL. CONQUER modularizes SNPs based on the underlying co-expression data and associates them with biological pathways in specific tissues. CONQUER was used to analyze 403 previously identified type 2 diabetes risk loci. In all tissues, the majority of SNPs (mean = 13.50, SD = 11.70) were linked to metabolism. A tissue-shared effect was found for four type 2 diabetes-associated SNPs (rs601945, rs1061810, rs13737, rs4932265) that were associated with differential expression of HLA-DQA2, HSD17B12, MAN2C1 and AP3S2 respectively. Seven SNPs were identified that influenced the expression of seven ribosomal proteins in multiple tissues. Finally, one SNP (rs601945) was found to influence multiple HLA genes in all twelve tissues investigated.\n\nConclusionWe present an universal R-package that aggregates and visualizes data in order to better understand functional consequences of GWAS loci. Using CONQUER, we showed that type 2 diabetes risk loci have many tissue-shared effects on multiple pathways including metabolism, the ribosome and HLA pathway.",

Mutants lacking BAT proteins are unable to induce host sporulation. Utilising novel microfluidic devices in combination with fluorescence microscopy we observed the accumulation of BAT-deficient mutants in specific fungal side-hyphae with accompanying increased fungal re-infection. High-resolution live imaging revealed septa biogenesis at the base of infected hyphae leading to compartmental trapping of BATdeficient endobacteria. Trapped endosymbionts showed reduced intracellular survival, suggesting a protective response from the fungal host against bacteria lacking specific effectors. These findings underscore the involvement of BAT proteins in maintaining a balance between mutualism and antagonism in bacterial-fungal interactions and provide deeper insights into the dynamic interactions between bacteria and eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The mosquito antiviral response has been mainly studied in the case of arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) infection in female mosquitoes. However, in nature, both female and male mosquitoes are abundantly infected with insect-specific viruses (ISVs). ISVs are capable of infecting the reproductive organs of both sexes and are maintained primarily by vertical transmission. Since the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated antiviral response plays an important antiviral role in mosquitoes, ISVs constitute a relevant model to study sex-dependent antiviral responses. Using a naturally generated viral stock containing three distinct ISVs, Aedes flavivirus (AEFV), Menghai Rhabdovirus (MERV) and Shinobi tetra virus (SHTV), we infected adult Aedes albopictus females and males and generated small RNA libraries from ovaries, testes, and the remainder of the body. Overall, both female and male mosquitoes showed unique small RNA profiles to each co-infecting ISV regardless the sex or tissue tested. While all three ISVs generated virus-derived siRNAs, only MERV generated virus-derived piRNAs. We also studied the expression of PIWI genes in reproductive tissues and carcasses. Piwi1-4 were abundantly expressed in ovaries and testes in contrast to Piwi5-9, suggesting that Piwi 5-9 are involved in exogenous viral piRNA production. Together, our results show that ISV-infected Aedes albopictus produce viral small RNAs in a virus-specific manner and that male mosquitoes mount a similar small RNA-mediated antiviral response to that of females.",

    "abstract": "Heat shock proteins (HSPs), which are encoded by conserved gene families in plants, are crucial for development and responses to diverse stresses. However, the wheat (Triticum aestivum) HSPs have not been systematically classified, especially those involved in protecting plants from disease. Here, we classified 119 DnaJ (Hsp40) proteins (TaDnaJs; encoded by 313 genes) and 41 Hsp70 proteins (TaHsp70s; encoded by 95 genes) into six and four groups, respectively, via a phylogenetic analysis. An examination of protein structures and a multiple sequence alignment revealed diversity in the TaDnaJ structural organization, but a highly conserved J-domain, which was usually characterized by an HPD motif followed by DRD or DED motifs. The expression profiles of these HSP-encoding homologous genes varied in response to Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. A quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated a lack of similarity in the expression of DnaJ70b, Hsp70-30b, and Hsp90-4b in wheat infected by B. graminis f. sp. tritici, although the expression levels of these genes were abnormal in the infected resistant and susceptible lines. Furthermore, a direct interaction between DnaJ70 and TaHsp70-30 was not detected in a yeast two-hybrid assay. This study revealed the structure and expression profiles of the HSP-encoding genes in wheat. The resulting data may be useful for future functional analyses and for further elucidating the roles of wheat HSPs during responses to fungal infections.",

    "abstract": "Plant architecture is determined by the iterative building of phytomer units, each containing a portion of stem, an organ and an axillary meristem. Each phytomer can follow different developmental paths underpinning the complexity, and plasticity, of plant form. Auxin plays a central role in the coordination of phytomer development, regulating organ initiation and patterning across all axes. This diversity in auxin function results from changes in the activities and expression of auxin signaling components, including the AUX/IAA repressors. Higher land plants have multigene AUX/IAA families, which leads to functional redundancy. Dominant mutations, which prevent AUX/IAA degradation in response to auxin, have highlighted the importance of these proteins in fine-tuning organ development. Here we report a new dominant AUX/IAA mutant in maize, Hoja loca1 (Oja). Oja has a mutation in the degron motif of ZmIAA28 and specifically affects aerial organ initiation and leaf medio-lateral patterning, but phytomer initiation remains unchanged. Mutant phenotypes are variable and transcriptional profiling of individual meristems identified clusters of genes that may underpin the phenotypic differences. The unique phenotype of Oja provides evidence of species-specific sub-functionalization of the AUX/IAAs, and illustrates the crucial role of auxin signaling in the tight coordination of phytomer unit development.",

    "abstract": "The status and trend estimates derived from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), are critical sources of information for bird conservation. However, the estimates are partly dependent on the statistical model used. Therefore, multiple models are useful because not all of the varied uses of these estimates (e.g. inferences about long-term change, annual fluctuations, population cycles, recovery of once declining populations) are supported equally well by a single statistical model. Here we describe Bayesian hierarchical generalized additive models (GAM) for the BBS, which share information on the pattern of population change across a species range. We demonstrate the models and their benefits using data a selection of species; and we run a full cross-validation of the GAMs against two other models to compare predictive fit. The GAMs have better predictive fit than the standard model for all species studied here, and comparable predictive fit to an alternative first difference model. In addition, one version of the GAM described here (GAMYE) estimates a population trajectory that can be decomposed into a smooth component and the annual fluctuations around that smooth. This decomposition allows trend estimates based only on the smooth component, which are more stable between years and are therefore particularly useful for trend-based status assessments, such as those by the IUCN. It also allows for the easy customization of the model to incorporate covariates that influence the smooth component separately from those that influence annual fluctuations (e.g., climate cycles vs annual precipitation). For these reasons and more, this GAMYE model is a particularly useful model for the BBS-based status and trend estimates.\n\nLAY SUMMARYO_LIThe status and trend estimates derived from the North American Breeding Bird Survey are critical sources of information for bird conservation, but they are partly dependent on the statistical model used.\nC_LIO_LIWe describe a model to estimate population status and trends from the North American Breeding Bird Survey data, using a Bayesian hierarchical generalized additive mixed-model that allows for flexible population trajectories and shares information on population change across a species range.\nC_LIO_LIThe model generates estimates that are broadly useful for a wide range of common conservation applications, such as IUCN status assessments based on trends or changes in the rates of decline for species of concern; and the estimates have better or similar predictive accuracy to other models., and\nC_LI",

Placing these patterns in a historical context could yield reliable tools for predicting possible future scenarios. Paleoarchives of macro+ and micro-fossil remains, and most importantly biomarkers such as fossil pigments and ancient DNA present in various sedimentary deposits, allow long term changes in ecological communities to be analysed. We use recent compilations of data including fossil pigments, metabarcoding of sedimentary ancient DNA and microfossils together with data analysis to understand the impact of gradual versus abrupt climate changes on a lake`s ecosystem status over the last 14.5 kyr. We give examples of hypotheses that need long-term data, which can be addressed using well-established paleoproxy variables. These variables describe the climate, together with vegetation change and the appearance of anthropogenic forcing, either as a gradual change or an abrupt event. We were able to detect abrupt changes in the lake ecosystem during the stable period of the Holocene Thermal Maximum and we highlight the increased frequency and degree of perturbation in lakes due to non-immediate human activity over a larger region. Both observations demonstrate an impaired relationship between a gradual external driver and ecosystem response and apply to future scenarios of climate warming and increased human impact in north-eastern Europe.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe olive tree (Olea europaea L. subsp. europaea, Oleaceae) has been the most economic perennial crop for Mediterranean countries since its domestication around 6,000 years ago. Two taxonomic varieties are currently recognized: cultivated (var. europaea) and wild (var. sylvestris) trees. To shed light into the recent evolution and domestication of the olive tree, we sequenced the genomes of twelve individuals: ten var. europaea, one var. sylvestris, and one outgroup taxon (subsp. cuspidata). All of them were analysed together with an improved assembly of var. europaea reference genome and the available assembly of var. sylvestris.\n\nResultsOur analyses show that cultivated olives exhibit slightly lower levels of overall genetic diversity than wild forms, and that this can be partially explained by the occurrence of a mild population bottleneck 5000-7000 years ago during the primary domestication period. We also provide the first phylogenetic analysis of genome-wide sequences, which supports a continuous process of domestication of the olive tree. This, together with population structure and introgression analyses highlights genetic admixture with wild populations across the Mediterranean Basin in the course of domestication.\n\nConclusionsAltogether, our results suggest that a primary domestication area in the eastern Mediterranean basin was followed by numerous secondary events across most countries of southern Europe and northern Africa, often involving genetic admixture with genetically rich wild populations, particularly from the western Mediterranean Basin. Based on selection tests and a search for selective sweeps, we found that genes associated with stress response and developmental processes were positively selected in cultivars. However, we did not find evidence that genes involved in fruit size or oil content were under positive selection.",

    "abstract": "The inclusion of peptide retention time prediction promises to remove peptide identification ambiguity in complex LC-MS identification workflows. However, due to the way peptides are encoded in current prediction models, accurate retention times cannot be predicted for modified peptides. This is especially problematic for fledgling open modification searches, which will benefit from accurate retention time prediction for modified peptides to reduce identification ambiguity. We here therefore present DeepLC, a novel deep learning peptide retention time predictor utilizing a new peptide encoding based on atomic composition that allows the retention time of (previously unseen) modified peptides to be predicted accurately. We show that DeepLC performs similarly to current state-of-the-art approaches for unmodified peptides, and, more importantly, accurately predicts retention times for modifications not seen during training. Moreover, we show that DeepLCs ability to predict retention times for any modification enables potentially incorrect identifications to be flagged in an open modification search of CD8-positive T-cell proteome data. DeepLC is available under the permissive Apache 2.0 open source license and comes with a user-friendly graphical user interface, as well as a Python package on PyPI, Bioconda, and BioContainers for effortless workflow integration.",

    "abstract": "Interspecific hybridization can drive evolutionary adaptation to novel environments. The Saccharomycotina clade of budding yeasts includes many hybrid lineages, and hybridization has been proposed as a source for new pathogenic species. Candida orthopsilosis is an emerging opportunistic pathogen for which most clinical isolates are hybrids, each derived from one of at least four independent crosses between the same two parental lineages. To gain insight on the transcriptomic aftermath of hybridization in these pathogens, we analyzed allele-specific gene expression in two independently formed hybrid strains, and in a homozygous strain representative of one parental lineage. Our results show that the effect of hybridization on overall gene expression is rather limited, affecting ~4% of the studied genes. However, we identified a larger effect in terms of imbalanced allelic expression, affecting ~9.5% of the heterozygous genes in the hybrids. Some of these altered genes have functions related to pathogenicity, including zinc transport and superoxide dismutase activities. Additionally, the number of shared genes with imbalanced expression in the two independently formed hybrids was higher than random expectation, suggesting selective retention. While it remains unclear whether the observed imbalanced genes play a role in virulence, our results suggest that differences in allele-specific expression may add an additional layer of phenotypic plasticity to traits related to virulence in C. orthopsilosis hybrids.\n\nImportanceHow new pathogens emerge is an important question that remains largely unanswered. Some emerging yeast pathogens are hybrids originated through the crossing of two different species, but how hybridization contributes to a higher virulence is unclear. Here we show that hybrids selectively retain gene regulation plasticity inherited from the two parents, and that this plasticity affects genes involved in virulence.",

Innate immune response also mounts a defense response against various allergens and pollutants including particulate matter present in the atmosphere. Air pollution has been included as the top threat to global health declared by WHO which aims to cover more than three billion people against health emergencies from 2019-2023. Particulate matter (PM), one of the major components of air pollution, is a significant risk factor for many human diseases and its adverse effects include morbidity and premature deaths throughout the world. Several clinical and epidemiological studies have identified a key link between the PM composition and the prevalence of respiratory and inflammatory disorders. However, the underlying molecular mechanism is not well understood. Here, we investigated the influence of air pollutant, PM10 during RNA virus infections using highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). We thus characterized the transcriptomic profile of lung epithelial cell line, A549 treated with PM10 prior to infection with (HPAI) H5N1 influenza virus, which is known to severely affect the lung and cause respiratory damage. We found that PM10 regulates virus infectivity and enhances overall pathogenic burden in the lung cells. Additionally, the transcriptomic profile highlights the connection of host factors related to various metabolic pathways and immune responses which were dysregulated during virus infection. Overall our findings suggest a strong link between the prevalence of respiratory illness and the air quality.",

    "abstract": "The thick mucus within the airways of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) promotes frequent respiratory infections that are often polymicrobial. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are two of the most prevalent pathogens that cause CF pulmonary infections, and both have been associated with worse lung function. Furthermore, the ability of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus to form biofilms promotes the establishment of chronic infections that are often difficult to eradicate using antimicrobial agents. In this study, we found that multiple LasR-regulated exoproducts of P. aeruginosa, including HQNO, siderophores, phenazines, and rhamnolipids, likely contribute to the ability of P. aeruginosa to shift S. aureus norfloxacin susceptibility profiles. Here, we observe that exposure to P. aeruginosa exoproducts leads to an increase in intracellular norfloxacin accumulation by S. aureus. We previously showed that P. aeruginosa supernatant dissipates S. aureus membrane potential, and furthermore, depletion of the S. aureus proton-motive force recapitulates the effect of P. aeruginosa supernatant on shifting norfloxacin sensitivity profiles of biofilm-grown S. aureus. From these results, we hypothesize that exposure to P. aeruginosa exoproducts leads to increased uptake of the drug and/or an impaired ability of S. aureus to efflux norfloxacin. Our results illustrate that microbially-derived products can greatly alter the ability of antimicrobial agents to kill bacterial biofilms.\n\nImportancePseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are frequently co-isolated from multiple infection sites, including the lungs of individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-healing diabetic foot ulcers. Co-infection with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus has been shown to produce worse outcomes compared to infection with one organism alone. Furthermore, the ability of these pathogens to form biofilms enables them to cause persistent infection and withstand antimicrobial therapy. In this study, we found that P. aeruginosa-secreted products dramatically increase the ability of the antibiotic norfloxacin to kill S. aureus biofilms. Understanding how interspecies interactions alter the antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial biofilms may inform treatment decisions and inspire the development of new therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesHIV-1 can infect and persist in different organs and tissues, resulting in the generation of multiple viral compartments and reservoirs. Increasing evidence supports the kidney as such a reservoir. Previous work demonstrated that HIV-1 infected CD4+ T-cells transfer virus to renal tubule epithelial (RTE) cells through cell-to-cell contact. In addition to CD4+ T-cells, macrophages represent the other major target of HIV-1. Renal macrophages induce and regulate inflammatory responses and are critical to homeostatic regulation of the kidney environment. Combined with their ability to harbor virus, macrophages may also play an important role in the spread of HIV-1 infection in the kidney.\n\nDesign and MethodsMultiparametric histochemistry analysis was performed on kidney biopsies from individuals with HIV-1 associated nephropathy (HIVAN). Primary monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with a (GFP)-expressing replication competent HIV-1. HIV-1 transfer from macrophages to RTE cells was carried out in a co-culture system and evaluated by fluorescence-microscopy and flow-cytometry. Live imaging was performed to assess the fate of HIV-1 infected RTE cells over time.\n\nResultsWe show that macrophages are abundantly present in the renal inflammatory infiltrate of individuals with HIVAN. We observed contact-dependent HIV-1 transfer from infected macrophages to both primary and immortalized renal cells. Live imaging of HIV-1 infected RTE cells revealed four different fates: proliferation, hypertrophy, latency and cell death.\n\nConclusionsOur study suggests that macrophages may play a role in the dissemination of HIV-1 in the kidney and that proliferation of infected renal cells may contribute to HIV-1 persistence in this compartment.",

    "abstract": "Humans encode proteins, called restriction factors, that inhibit replication of viruses like HIV-1. One family of antiviral proteins, apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3 (APOBEC3, shortened to A3) acts by deaminating cytidines to uridines during the reverse transcription reaction of HIV-1. The A3 locus encodes seven genes, named A3A-A3H. These genes either have one or two cytidine deaminase domains and several of these A3s potently restrict HIV-1. A3C, which has only a single cytidine deaminase domain, however, inhibits HIV-1 only very weakly. We tested novel double domain protein combinations by genetically linking two A3C genes to make a synthetic tandem domain protein. This protein created a \"super restriction factor\" that had more potent antiviral activity than the native A3C protein, which correlated with increased packaging into virions. Furthermore, disabling one of the active sites of the synthetic tandem domain protein results in an even greater increase in the antiviral activity--recapitulating a similar evolution seen in A3F and A3G (double domain A3s that only use a single catalytically active deaminase domain). These A3C tandem domain proteins do not have an increase in mutational activity, but instead inhibit formation of reverse transcription products which correlates with their ability to form large higher order complexes in cells. Finally, the A3C-A3C super restriction factor largely escaped antagonism by the HIV-1 viral protein, Vif.\n\nImportanceAs a part of the innate immune system, humans encode proteins that inhibit viruses like HIV-1. These broadly acting antiviral proteins do not protect humans from viral infections because viruses encode proteins that antagonize the host antiviral proteins to evade the innate immune system. One such example of a host antiviral protein is APOBEC3C (A3C), which weakly inhibits HIV-1. Here, we show that we can improve the antiviral activity of A3C by duplicating the DNA sequence to create a synthetic tandem domain, and furthermore, are relatively resistant to the viral antagonist, Vif. Together, these data give insights about how nature has evolved a defense against viral pathogens like HIV.",

Here, we analyzed changes in gut microbiota and their sulfur metabolites in the feces of a depression rat model using the modified 14-day social defeat stress (SDS) paradigm. Our results showed that SDS increased fecal Lactobacillus reuteri in correlation with ergothioneine levels at around day 11, which continued for at least one month following SDS administration. In vitro study further revealed that L. reuteri is capable of producing ergothioneine. Although the known anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative actions of ergothioneine suggested that the increased fecal ergothioneine levels may be related to intestinal anti-inflammatory defense mechanisms, no change was observed in the plasma ergothioneine levels during the same observation period, indicating that the defense mechanisms may not be sufficiently reflected in the body. As ergothioneine is a natural ingredient that is absorbed mainly from the upper gastrointestinal tract, we hypothesized that oral ergothioneine may exert antidepressant effects. As expected, oral administration of ergothioneine prior to and during the SDS paradigm had a preventative effect on SDS-induced depressive behaviors, such as social avoidance and depression-like sleep abnormalities, particularly those of rapid eye movement sleep. These findings indicate that ergothioneine, a metabolite of L. reuteri, may be a common substance in the microbiota-gut-brain axis that prevents stress-induced sleep disturbances, especially those associated with depression.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and anxiety disorders (ANX) are common neurodevelopmental conditions with several overlapping symptoms. Notably, many children and adolescents with ASD also have an ANX diagnosis, suggesting shared pathological mechanisms. Here, we leveraged structural imaging and phenotypic data from 82 closely matched children (28 ASD, 28 ANX, 26 typically developing controls). Our neuroimaging paradigm assessed cortical thickness and studied inter-regional structural covariance networks. Both ASD and ANX presented with atypical structural network organization relative to controls. Specifically, ASD presented with increased thickness in temporal and parietal midline cortices, while ANX was associated with increased cortical thickness in the left inferior frontal and precentral gyri. Despite the overall difference in the spatial distributions these clusters, unconstrained spin permutation testing showed that statistical maps from the ANX-vs-controls and ASD-vs-controls analyses were significantly correlated. The two diagnostic groups also presented with common decreases in structural covariance patterns, collectively pointing to decreased structural coupling between lateral frontal, lateral temporal, and temporo-parietal regions. Dimensional analysis of trait anxiety and social responsiveness partially recapitulated diagnosis-based findings. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for both shared as well as distinct effects of ASD and ANX on on regional and inter-regional structural network organization.",

    "abstract": "Animal behaviors are commonly organized into long-lasting states that coordinately impact the generation of diverse motor outputs such as feeding, locomotion, and grooming. However, the neural mechanisms that coordinate these diverse motor programs remain poorly understood. Here, we examine how the distinct motor programs of the nematode C. elegans are coupled together across behavioral states. We describe a new imaging platform that permits automated, simultaneous quantification of each of the main C. elegans motor programs over hours or days. Analysis of these whole-organism behavioral profiles shows that the motor programs coordinately change as animals switch behavioral states. Utilizing genetics, optogenetics, and calcium imaging, we identify a new role for dopamine in coupling locomotion and egg-laying together across states. These results provide new insights into how the diverse motor programs throughout an organism are coordinated and suggest that neuromodulators like dopamine can couple motor circuits together in a state-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Intratumoral genomic heterogeneity in glioblastoma (GBM) is a barrier to overcoming therapy resistance, and new strategies that are effective independent of genotype are urgently needed. By correlating intracellular metabolite levels with radiation resistance across dozens of genomically-distinct models of GBM, we found that purine metabolites strongly correlated with radiation resistance. Inhibiting purine, but not pyrimidine, synthesis radiosensitized GBM cells and patient-derived neurospheres by impairing DNA repair in a nucleoside-dependent fashion. Likewise, administration of exogenous purine nucleosides protected sensitive GBM models from radiation by promoting DNA repair. Combining an FDA-approved inhibitor of de novo purine synthesis with radiation arrested growth in GBM xenograft models and depleted intratumoral guanylates. High expression of the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo GTP synthesis was associated with shorter survival in GBM patients. Together, these findings indicate that inhibiting de novo purine synthesis may be a promising strategy to overcome therapy resistance in this genomically heterogeneous disease.",

    "abstract": "Genomic selection (GS) or genomic prediction is considered as a promising approach to accelerate tree breeding and increase genetic gain by shortening breeding cycle, but the efforts to develop routines for operational breeding are so far limited. We investigated the predictive ability (PA) of GS based on 484 progeny trees from 62 half-sib families in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) for wood density, modulus of elasticity (MOE) and microfibril angle (MFA) measured with SilviScan, as well as for measurements on standing trees by Pilodyn and Hitman instruments. GS predictive abilities were comparable with those based on pedigree-based prediction. The highest PAs were reached with at least 80-90% of the dataset used as training set. Use of different statistical methods had no significant impact on the estimated PAs. We also compared the abilities to predict density, MFA and MOE of 19 year old trees with models trained on data from coring at different ages and to different depths into the stem. 78-95% of the maximal PAs obtained from coring to the pith at high age were reached by using data possible to obtain by drilling 3-5 rings towards the pith at tree age 10-12, thereby shortening the cycle and reducing the impact on the tree.",

    "abstract": "Surprise signals a discrepancy between past and current beliefs. It is theorized to be linked to affective experiences, the creation of particularly resilient memories, and segmentation of the flow of experience into discrete perceived events. However, the ability to precisely measure naturalistic surprise has remained elusive. We used advanced basketball analytics to derive a quantitative measure of surprise and characterized its behavioral, physiological, and neural correlates in human subjects observing basketball games. We found that surprise was associated with segmentation of ongoing experiences, as reflected by subjectively perceived event boundaries and shifts in neocortical patterns underlying belief states. Interestingly, these effects differed by whether surprising moments contradicted or bolstered current predominant beliefs. Surprise also positively correlated with pupil dilation, activation in subcortical regions associated with dopamine, game enjoyment, and long-term memory. These investigations support key predictions from event segmentation theory and extend theoretical conceptualizations of surprise to real-world contexts.",

    "abstract": "The use of population encoding models has come to dominate the study of human visual neuroscience, serving as a primary tool for making inferences about neural code changes based on indirect measurements. A popular approach in computational neuroimaging is to use such models to obtain estimates of neural population responses via inverted encoding modeling. Recent research suggests that this approach may be prone to identifiability problems, with multiple mechanisms of encoding change producing similar changes in the estimated population responses. Psychophysical data might be able to provide additional constraints to infer the encoding change mechanism underlying some behavior of interest. However, computational work aimed at determining to what extent different mechanisms can be differentiated using psychophysics is lacking. Here, we used simulation to explore exactly which of a number of changes in neural population codes could be differentiated from observed changes in psychophysical thresholds. Eight mechanisms of encoding change were under study, chosen because they have been proposed in the previous literature as mechanisms for improved task performance (e.g., due to attention or learning): specific and nonspecific gain, specific and nonspecific tuning, specific suppression, specific suppression plus gain, and inward and outward tuning shifts. We simulated psychophysical thresholds as a function of both external noise (TvN curves) or stimulus value (TvS curves) for a number of variations of each one of the models. With the exception of specific gain and specific tuning, all studied mechanisms produced qualitatively different patterns of change in the TvN and TvS curves, suggesting that psychophysical studies can be used as a complement to inverted encoding modeling, and provide strong constraints on inferences based on the latter. We use our results to provide recommendations for interested researchers and to re-interpret previous psychophysical data in terms of mechanisms of encoding change.",

    "abstract": "The majority of the brains vasculature is comprised of intricate capillary networks lined by capillary pericytes. However, it remains unclear whether capillary pericytes contribute to blood flow control. Using two-photon microscopy to observe and manipulate single capillary pericytes in vivo, we find their optogenetic stimulation decreases lumen diameter and blood flow, but with slower kinetics than mural cells of upstream pial and pre-capillary arterioles. This slow, optogenetically-induced vasoconstriction was inhibited by the clinically-used vasodilator fasudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor that blocks contractile machinery. Capillary pericytes were also slower to constrict back to baseline following hypercapnia-induced dilation, and relax towards baseline following optogenetically-induced vasoconstriction. In a complementary approach, optical ablation of single capillary pericytes led to sustained local dilation and a doubling of blood cell flux in capillaries lacking pericyte contact. Altogether these data indicate that capillary pericytes contribute to basal blood flow resistance and slow modulation of blood flow throughout the capillary bed.",

    "abstract": "Bifidobacterium is an important gut microbiota member during early life that is associated with improved gut health. However, the underlying health-driving mechanisms are not well understood, particularly how Bifidobacterium may modulate the intestinal barrier via programming of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). In this study, we sought to investigate the global impact of model strain Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 on the neonatal IEC transcriptome, including gene regulation and pathway modulation. Small IECs from two-week-old neonatal mice administered B. breve UCC2003 for three consecutive days or PBS (control group) were subjected to global RNASeq, with various bioinformatic approaches used to determine differentially expressed genes, pathways and affected cell types between control and experimental groups. Whilst colonisation with B. breve had minimal impacts on the neonatal microbiota, we observed extensive regulation of the IEC transcriptome; ~4,000 genes significantly up-regulated, including key genes associated with epithelial barrier function. Enrichment of cell differentiation and cell proliferation pathways were observed, along with an overrepresentation of stem cell marker genes, indicating an increase in the regenerative potential of the epithelial layer. Expression of distinct immune-associated pathway members (e.g. Toll-like Receptors) were also affected after neonatal B. breve colonisation. In conclusion, B. breve UCC2003 plays a central role in driving universal transcriptomic changes in neonatal IECs that enhances cell replication, differentiation and growth, predominantly in the stem cell compartment. This study enhances our overall understanding of the benefits of B. breve in driving intestinal epithelium homeostatic development during early life, with potential avenues to develop novel live biotherapeutic products.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance gene mcr-1 has been disseminated globally since its first discovery in Southern China in late 2015. However, the mcr-1 gene had not been identified previously in Salmonella isolates from poultry in Bangladesh. Here, we aimed to explore antimicrobial resistance gene mcr-1 in Salmonella isolates. Eighty two Salmonella isolates were isolated and characterized from suspected poultry specimens received from different zones of the country. A phenotypic disc diffusion assay with 15 antimicrobial agents was performed following CLSI standard. The disk diffusion assay showed that, all of the isolates presented high resistance to colistin (92.68%), oxytetracycline (86.59%), co-trimoxazole (76.83%), ciprofloxacin (73.17%) and enrofloxacin (65.85%). Further, randomly selected 10 Salmonella isolates were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting genus-specific invA and antimicrobial (colistin) resistance mcr-1 genes. Five were confirmed for the presence of the mcr-1 gene belonging to Salmonella spp. Further, sequencing followed by phylogenetic analysis revealed divergent evolutionary relation between the LptA and MCR proteins rendering them resistant to colistin. Three-dimensional homology structures of MCR-1 proteins were constructed and verified using different bioinformatics tools. Moreover, molecular docking interactions suggested that, MCR-1 and LptA share a similar substrate binding cavity which could be validated for the functional analysis. The results represent here is the first molecular and in silico analysis of colistin resistance mcr-1 gene of Salmonella in poultry in Bangladesh, which may emphasize the importance of the study on antibiotic resistance genes requiring for national monitoring and strategic surveillance in the country.",

    "abstract": "The location of nucleosomes in chromatin significantly impacts many biological processes including DNA replication, repair and gene expression. A number of techniques have been developed for mapping nucleosome locations in chromatin including MN-Seq (micrococcal nuclease digestion followed by next generation sequencing), ATAC-Seq (Tagamet chromatin fragmentation followed by next generation sequencing), and ChIP-Seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation and fragmentation followed by next generation sequencing). All of these techniques have been successfully used, but each with its own limitations. Recently, New England Biolabs has marketed a new kit, the NEBNext UltraII FS Library Prep kit, for preparing libraries for next generation sequencing from purified genomic DNA. This kit is based on a novel proprietary DNA fragmentation procedure which appears to cleave DNA that is not bound by proteins. Because DNA is fragmented directly in the FS kit, we tested whether the kit might also be useful for mapping the location of nucleosomes in chromatin. Using Simian Virus 40 (SV40) chromatin isolated at different times in an infection, we have compared nucleosome mapping using the NEB FS kit (FS-Seq) to MN-Seq, ATAC-Seq, and ChIP-Seq. Mapping nucleosomes using FS-Seq generated nucleosome profiles similar to those generated by ATAC-Seq and ChIP-Seq in regulatory regions of the SV40 genome. We conclude that FS-Seq is a simple, robust, cost-effective procedure for mapping nucleosomes in SV40 chromatin that should be useful for other forms of chromatin as well. We also present evidence that the FS kit may be useful for mapping the location of transcription factors in chromatin when sequencing reads between 75 and 99 base pairs in size are analyzed.",

    "abstract": "Express saccades, a mode of visually guided saccades, distinguished from regular saccades by extremely short reaction times, are triggered by inserting a temporal gap between the fixation dot and the saccade target. It is usually assumed that they are produced by a specific pathway in which the superior colliculus plays a key role. Whether and how this pathway deals with information on the subjective value of a saccade target is unknown. We, therefore, studied the influence of varying reward expectancies and compared it with the impact of the presence and absence of a temporal gap between the disappearance of the fixation dot and the appearance of the target on the visually guided saccades of two rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). We observed that the introduction of a gap shifted the entire saccadic reaction time distribution to shorter latencies while increasing the probability of express saccades. On the other hand, promoting the monkeys reward expectancy shortened reaction times and increased peak velocities of regular saccades, and increased the probability of express saccades. Importantly, we observed that the reaction time and peak velocity of express saccades were not sensitive to the value of the saccade target, suggesting that the express pathway does not have access to information on value. We propose a new model on express saccades that treats the salience of visual objects in the scene differently from the subjective value assigned to them.",

Herein, we characterized the site-specific N-glycosylation of S protein at the level of intact glycopeptides. All 22 potential N-glycosites were identified in the S-protein protomer and were found to be preserved among the 753 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences. The glycosites exhibited glycoform heterogeneity as expected for a human cell-expressed protein subunits. We identified masses that correspond to 157 N-glycans, primarily of the complex type. In contrast, the insect cell-expressed S protein contained 38 N-glycans, primarily of the high-mannose type. Our results revealed that the glycan types were highly determined by the differential processing of N-glycans among human and insect cells. This N-glycosylation landscape and the differential N-glycan patterns among distinct host cells are expected to shed light on the infection mechanism and present a positive view for the development of vaccines and targeted drugs.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsACE2angiotensin-converting enzyme IICryo-EMcryoelectron microscopyEenvelope proteinHCoV-NL63human coronavirus NL63Mmembrane proteinMSmass spectrometryMERS-CoVMiddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirusNnucleocapsid proteinRBDreceptor-binding domainSspike proteinSARS-CoV-2severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusSCEstepped collision energyZic-HILICzwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographyView Full Text",

We present an easy-to-use internal control (IC) method focussing on technical process control applied to metagenomics in clinical diagnostics.\n\nMethodsDNA of nine urine samples was sequenced in the absence and presence of Thermus thermophilus DNA as IC in incremental concentrations (0.5-2-5%). Between aliquots of each sample, we compared the IC relative abundance (RA), and after in silico subtraction of IC reads, the microbiota and the RA of pathogens. The optimal IC spike-in concentration was defined as the lowest concentration still detectable in all samples.\n\nResultsThe RA of IC correlated linearly with the spiked IC concentration (r2=0.99). IC added in a concentration of 0.5% of total DNA concentration was detectable in all samples, regardless of human/bacterial composition and after in silico removal gave the smallest difference in RA of pathogens compared to the unspiked aliquot of the sample. The microbiota of sample aliquots sequenced in the presence and absence of IC was highly similar after in silico removal of IC reads (median BC-dissimilarity per sample of 0.059), provided samples had sufficient bacterial read counts.\n\nConclusionT. thermophilus DNA at a percentage of 0.5% of the total DNA concentration can be applied for the process control of mNGS of urine samples.

    "abstract": "Plasmids harboring antibiotic resistance genes differ in their kinetic values as plasmid conjugation rate, segregation rate by incompatibility with related plasmids, rate of stochastic loss during replication, cost reducing the host-cell fitness, and frequency of compensatory mutations to reduce plasmid cost, depending on the cell mutation frequency. How variation in these values influence the success of a plasmid and their resistance genes in complex ecosystems, as the microbiota? Genes are located in plasmids, plasmids in cells, cells in populations. These populations are embedded in ensembles of species in different human hosts, are able to exchange between them bacterial ensembles during cross-infection and are located in the hospital or the community setting, under various levels of antibiotic exposure. Simulations using new membrane computing methods help predict the influence of plasmid kinetic values on such multilevel complex system. In our simulation, conjugation frequency needed to be at least 10-3 to clearly influence the dominance of a strain with a resistant plasmid. Host strains able to stably maintain two copies of similar plasmids harboring different resistances, coexistence of these resistances can occur in the population. Plasmid loss rates of 10-4 or 10-5 or plasmid fitness costs [&ge;]0.06 favor the plasmids located in the most abundant species. The beneficial effect of compensatory mutations for plasmid fitness cost is proportional to this cost, only at high mutation frequencies (10-3-10-5). Membrane computing helps set a multilevel landscape to study the effect of changes in plasmid kinetic values on the success of resistant organisms in complex ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Legumes form a symbiosis with rhizobia that convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to ammonia which they provide to the plant in return for a carbon and nutrient supply. Nodules, developed as part of the symbiosis, harbor rhizobia which are enclosed in the plant-derived symbiosome membrane (SM), to form a symbiosome. In the mature nodule all exchanges between the symbionts occur across the SM. Here we characterize GmYSL7, a member of Yellow stripe-like family which is localized to the SM in soybean nodules. It is expressed specifically in nodule infected cells with expression peaking soon after nitrogenase becomes active. Although most members of the family transport metal complexed with phytosiderophores, GmYSL7 does not. It transports oligopeptides of between four and 12 amino acids. Silencing of GmYSL7 reduces nitrogenase activity and blocks development when symbiosomes contain a single bacteroid. RNAseq of nodules in which GmYSL7 is silenced suggests that the plant initiates a defense response against the rhizobia. There is some evidence that metal transport in the nodules is dysregulated, with upregulation of genes encoding ferritin and vacuolar iron transporter family and downregulation of a gene encoding nicotianamine synthase. However, it is not clear whether the changes are a result of the reduction of nitrogen fixation and the requirement to store excess iron or an indication of a role of GmYSL7 in regulation of metal transport in the nodules. Further work to identify the physiological substrate for GmYSL7 will allow clarification of this role.\n\nOne sentence summaryGmYSL7 is a symbiosome membrane peptide transporter that is essential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation that when silenced blocks symbiosome development.",

    "abstract": "1.Examining CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses after primary Yellow Fever vaccination in a cohort of 210 volunteers, we have identified and tetramer-validated 92 CD8+ and 50 CD4+ T cell epitopes, many inducing strong and prevalent (i.e. immunodominant) T cell responses. Restricted by 40 and 14 HLA-class I and II allotypes, respectively, these responses have wide population coverage and might be of considerable academic, diagnostic and therapeutic interest. The broad coverage of epitopes and HLA overcame the otherwise confounding effects of HLA diversity and non-HLA background providing the first evidence of T cell immunodomination in humans. Also, double-staining of CD4+ T cells with tetramers representing the same HLA-binding core, albeit with different flanking regions, demonstrated an extensive diversification of the specificities of many CD4+ T cell responses. We suggest that this could reduce the risk of pathogen escape, and that multi-tetramer staining is required to reveal the true magnitude and diversity of CD4+ T cell responses. Our T cell epitope discovery approach uses a combination of 1) overlapping peptides representing the entire Yellow Fever virus proteome to search for peptides containing CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell epitopes, 2) predictors of peptide-HLA binding to suggest epitopes and their restricting HLA allotypes, 3) generation of peptide-HLA tetramers to identify T cell epitopes, and 4) analysis of ex vivo T cell responses to validate the same. This approach is systematic, exhaustive, and can be done in any individual of any HLA haplotype. It is all-inclusive in the sense that it includes all protein antigens and peptide epitopes, and encompasses both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. It is efficient and, importantly, reduces the false discovery rate. The unbiased nature of the T cell epitope discovery approach presented here should support the refinement of future peptide-HLA class I and II predictors and tetramer technologies, which eventually should cover all HLA class I and II isotypes. We believe that future investigations of emerging pathogens (e.g. SARS-CoV-2) should include population-wide T cell epitope discovery using blood samples from patients, convalescents and/or long-term survivors, who might all hold important information on T cell epitopes and responses.",

    "abstract": "Studies on confidence in decision-making tasks have repeatedly shown correlations between confidence and the characteristics of motor responses. Here, we show the results of two experiments in which we manipulated the type of motor response that precedes confidence rating. Participants decided which box, left or right, contained more dots and then reported their confidence in this decision. In Experiment 1, prior to confidence rating, participants were required to follow a motor cue. Cued-response type was manipulated in two dimensions: task-compatibility (the relation between response set and task-relevant decision alternatives), and stimulus-congruence (spatial correspondence between response key and the location of the stimulus that should be chosen). In Experiment 2, a decision-related response set was randomly varied in each trial, being either vertical (task incompatible) or horizontal (task-compatible, spatially congruent and incongruent). The main results showed that choice confidence increased following task-compatible responses, i.e. responses related to the alternatives of the choice in which confidence was reported. Moreover, confidence was higher in these conditions, independently of response accuracy and spatial congruence with the  correct stimuli. We interpret these results as suggesting that action appropriate in the context of a given task is an indicator of successful completion of the decision-related process. Such an action, even a spurious one, inflates decisional confidence.",

SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) have been rapidly developed and quickly applied to clinical testing during the pandemic. However, studies evaluating the performance of these NAAT assays are limited. We evaluated the performance of four NAATs, which were marked by the Conformite Europeenne and widely used in China during the pandemic. Results showed that the analytical sensitivity of the four assays was significantly lower than that claimed by the NAAT manufacturers. The limit of detection (LOD) of Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs was 3000 copies/mL, whereas the LOD of Bioperfectus NAATs was 4000 copies/mL. The results of the consistency test using 46 samples showed that Daan, Sansure, and Hybribio NAATs could detect the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity of 100% (16 /16), whereas Bioperfectus NAAT detected the samples with a specificity of 100% (30/30) and a sensitivity 81.25% (13/16). The sensitivity of Bioperfectus NAAT was lower than that of the three other NAATs; this finding was consistent with the result that Bioperfectus NAAT had a higher LOD than the three other kinds of NAATs. The four above mentioned reagents presented high specificity; however, for the detection of the samples with low virus concentration, Bioperfectus reagent had the risk of missing detection. Therefore, the LOD should be considered in the selection of SARS-CoV-2 NAATs.",

    "abstract": "Whether the brain operates at a critical   tipping\" point is a long standing scientific question, with evidence from both cellular and systems-scale studies suggesting that the brain does sit in, or near, a critical regime. Neuroimaging studies of humans in altered states of consciousness have prompted the suggestion that maintenance of critical dynamics is necessary for the emergence of consciousness and complex cognition, and that reduced or disorganized consciousness may be associated with deviations from criticality. Unfortunately, many of the cellular-level studies reporting signs of criticality were performed in non-conscious systems (in vitro neuronal cultures) or unconscious animals (e.g. anaesthetized rats). Here we attempted to address this knowledge gap by exploring critical brain dynamics in invasive ECoG recordings from multiple sessions with a single macaque as the animal transitioned from consciousness to unconsciousness under different anaesthetics (ketamine and propofol). We use a previously-validated test of criticality: avalanche dynamics to assess the differences in brain dynamics between normal consciousness and both drug-states. Propofol and ketamine were selected due to their differential effects on consciousness (ketamine, but not propofol, is known to induce an unusual state known as  dissociative anaesthesia\"). Our analyses indicate that propofol dramatically restricted the size and duration of avalanches, while ketamine allowed for more awake-like dynamics to persist. In addition, propofol, but not ketamine, triggered a large reduction in the complexity of brain dynamics. All states, however, showed some signs of persistent criticality when testing for exponent relations and universal shape-collapse. Further, maintenance of critical brain dynamics may be important for regulation and control of conscious awareness.\n\nAuthor summaryHere we explore how different anaesthetic drugs change the nature of brain dynamics, using neural activity recorded from sub-dural electrophysiological arrays implanted in a macaque brain. Previous research has suggested that loss of consciousness under anaesthesia is associated with a movement away from critical brain dynamics, towards a less flexible regime. When comparing ketamine and propofol, two anaesthetics with largely different effects on consciousness, we find that propofol, but not ketamine, produces a dramatic reduction in the complexity of brain activity and restricts the range of scales where critical dynamics are plausible. These results suggest that maintenance of critical dynamics may be important for regulation and control of conscious awareness.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACTEarly-life development of infants may be critically affected by man-made or natural contaminants including mycotoxins. However, data on the occurrence of food contaminants in breast milk is scarce and prohibits a comprehensive exposure and risk assessment for mothers and their infants.Here, we present a longitudinal exposure assessment over the first 211 days of a single newborn girl (study A) by measuring multiple mycotoxins in milk. Eighty-seven consecutive breast milk samples were obtained from the newborn\u2019s mother living in Austria and following a regular mixed diet. Mycotoxins were analyzed by utilizing a highly sensitive LC-MS/MS approach covering 29 mycotoxins and key metabolites. In addition to this longitudinal study, three mothers provided breast milk samples each on five consecutive days, for a preliminary comparison of inter-day and inter-individual variation in exposures (study B). Study A revealed that mycotoxin occurrence in breast milk was limited to the emerging mycotoxins alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), beauvericin (BEA), enniatins (A, A1, B, B1) and to ochratoxin A (OTA), which is regulated in commercial infant food. These mycotoxins were, if present, mostly detected at very low concentrations (&lt;10 ng/L), except AME which exceeded this concentration on two distinct days by a factor of 3x and 5x. Overall, longitudinal results indicated chronic low-dose exposure to the detected mycotoxins. Other regulated mycotoxins including the carcinogenic aflatoxins or the estrogenic zearalenone and their biotransformation products were absent in all tested samples. Study B confirmed the results of study A, with minimal inter-day and inter-individual variation. In addition, a preliminary correlation of OTA levels occurring in breast milk and matched urine samples was found (r=0.64, p=0.034) in study B. Based on the data set obtained in study A, exposure of the infant was estimated. Exposure estimates of individual mycotoxins were on average below 1 ng/kg body weight per day.Our preliminary findings suggest that recommended maximum daily intake levels might not be exceeded in the Austrian population. However, exposure is likely to be higher in populations with lower food safety standards. In the light of co-occurrence of several emerging mycotoxins in breast milk, future studies should address low-dose mixture effects. This also includes other environmental contaminants which may be present in this bio-fluid and should involve an exposome-scale risk assessment. All these efforts must be intended to minimize exposure of mothers and infants in a window of high susceptibility.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Walking function, which is critical to performing many activities of daily living, is commonly assessed by walking speed. Walking speed is dependent on propulsion, which is governed by ankle moment and the posture of the trailing limb during push-off. Here, we present a new gait training paradigm that utilizes a dual belt treadmill to train both components of propulsion by accelerating the belt of the trailing limb during push off. Accelerations require subjects to produce greater propulsive force to counteract inertial effects, and increase trailing limb angle through increased belt velocity.\n\nWe hypothesized that exposure to our training p rogram would produce after effects in propulsion mechanics and, consequently, walking speed. We tested our protocol on healthy subjects at two acceleration magnitudes-Perceptible (PE), and Imperceptible, (IM)-and compared their results to a third control group (VC) that walked at a higher velocity during training.\n\nResults show that the PE group significantly increased walking speed following training (mean {+/-} s.e.m: 0.073 {+/-} 0.013 m/s, p < 0.001). The change in walking speed in the IM and VC groups was not significant at the group level (IM: 0.032 {+/-} 0.013 m/s; VC: -0.003 {+/-} 0.013 m/s). Responder analysis showed that changes in push-off posture and in neuro-motor control of ankle plantar-flexor muscles contributed to the larger increases in gait speed measured in the PE group compared to the IM and VC groups. Analysis of the effects during and after training suggest that changes in neuromotor coordination are consistent with use-dependent learning.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an effective and non-invasive indicator for the detection and prevention of arrhythmia. ECG signals are susceptible to noise contamination, which can lead to errors in ECG interpretation. Therefore, ECG pretreatment is important for accurate analysis. In this paper, a method of noise reduction based on deep learning is proposed. The method is divided into two stages, and two corresponding models are formed. In the first stage, a one-dimensional U-net model is designed for ECG signal denoising to eliminate noise as much as possible. The one-dimensional DR-net model in the second stage is used to reconstruct the ECG signal and to correct the waveform distortion caused by noise removal in the first stage. In this paper, the U-net and the DR-net are constructed by the convolution method to achieve end-to-end mapping from noisy ECG signals to clean ECG signals. The ECG data used in this paper are from CPSC2018, and the noise signal is from MIT-BIH Noise Stress Test Database (NSTDB). In the experiment, the improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio SNRimp, the root mean square error decrease RMSEde, and the correlation coefficient P, are used to evaluate the performance of the network. This two-stage method is compared with FCN and U-net alone. The experimental results show that the two-stage noise reduction method can eliminate complex noise in the ECG signal while retaining the characteristic shape of the ECG signal. According to the results, we believe that the proposed method has a good application prospect in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA personalized prediction of upper limb neurorehabilitation outcomes in persons with multiple sclerosis (pwMS) promises to optimize the allocation of therapy and to stratify individuals for resource-demanding clinical trials. Previous research identified predictors on a population level through linear models and clinical data, including conventional assessments describing sensorimotor impairments. The objective of this work was to explore the feasibility of providing an individualized and more accurate prediction of rehabilitation outcomes in pwMS by leveraging non-linear machine learning models, clinical data, and digital health metrics characterizing sensorimotor impairments.\n\nMethodsClinical data and digital health metrics were recorded from eleven pwMS undergoing neurorehabilitation. Machine learning models were trained on data recorded pre-intervention. The dependent variables indicated whether a considerable improvement on the activity level was observed across the intervention or not (binary classification), as defined by the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT), Box and Block Test (BBT), or Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT).\n\nResultsIn a cross-validation, considerable improvements in ARAT or BBT could be accurately predicted (94% balanced accuracy) by only relying on patient master data. Considerable improvements in NHPT could be accurately predicted (89% balanced accuracy), but required knowledge about sensorimotor impairments. Assessing these with digital health metrics instead of conventional scales allowed increasing the balanced accuracy by +17% . Non-linear machine-learning models improved the predictive accuracy for the NHPT by +25% compared to linear models.\n\nConclusionsThis work demonstrates the feasibility of a personalized prediction of upper limb neurorehabilitation outcomes in pwMS using multi-modal data collected before neurorehabilitation and machine learning. Information from digital health metrics about sensorimotor impairment was necessary to predict changes in dexterous hand control, thereby underlining their potential to provide a more sensitive and fine-grained assessment than conventional scales. Non-linear models outperformed ones, suggesting that the commonly assumed linearity of neurorehabilitation is oversimplified.\n\nclinicaltrials.gov registration number: NCT02688231",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder worldwide and affects individuals of all ages. It causes significant psychosocial impairments and is a major cause of disability. A recent consortium study identified 102 genetic variants and 269 genes associated with depression. To provide targets for future depression research, we prioritized these recently identified genes using expression data. We examined differential expression of these genes in three studies that profiled gene expression of MDD cases and controls across multiple brain regions. In addition, we integrated anatomical expression information to determine which brain regions and transcriptomic cell-types highly express the candidate genes. We highlight 11 of the 269 genes with the most consistent differential expression: MANEA, UBE2M, CKB, ITPR3, SPRY2, SAMD5, TMEM106B, ZC3H7B, LST1, ASXL3 and HSPA1A. The majority of these top genes were found to have sex-specific differential expression. We place greater emphasis on MANEA as it is the top gene in a more conservative analysis of the 269. Specifically, differential expression of MANEA was strongest in cerebral cortex regions and had opposing sex-specific effects. Anatomically, our results suggest the importance of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, cholinergic, monoaminergic, and enteric neurons. These findings provide a guide for targeted experiments to advance our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of depression.",

We sampled herbaceous and woody component of vegetation in four plots near roads and four plots further from roads to test these hypothesis. Sampled species were classified according to their resprouting capacity, nitrogen fixation, succulence/spines, urticancy/toxicity, lifeform, endozoochory, maximum height and maximum diameter, before we calculated the taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity of plant communities. Species richness, taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversities were lower in plots close to the roads, confirming roads as sources of disturbances. The phylogenetic structure of the Caatinga vegetation near roads was clustered, indicating environmental filtering by herbivory as the main pervasive disturbance in Caatinga ecosystems, since traits related to herbivory deterrence were conserved within phylogenetic lineages and were filtered in near roads. Thus, roads should be considered degradation conduits causing taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional impoverishment of Caatinga vegetation.",

High levels of IGF-1 have been linked to increased mortality, partly by causing oxidative stress. However, these effects have no experimental evidence in wild animals. We implanted microspheres loaded with exogenous IGF-1 into bearded reedlings, a common short-lived Eurasian songbird. The treatment elevated plasma IGF-1 levels for at least 24 h. Oxidative damage to lipids significantly increased the day after the manipulation in treated birds, but returned to baseline levels four days post-treatment. The treatment had no effect on survival over 16 months; however, birds with higher pre-treatment (baseline) IGF-1 levels had better survival prospects. These results suggest that, although high IGF-1 levels may induce oxidative damage, natural variation in this hormones level may reflect the outcome of individual optimization.",

    "abstract": "Mammary-derived serotonin [5HT] has been implicated in breast-to-bone communication during lactation by increasing parathyroid hormone related-peptide [PTHrP] in the mammary gland. It is well-established that PTHrP acts on the bone to liberate calcium for the milk during lactation; however, the mechanism of 5HTs regulation of PTHrP has not been fully elucidated. Recently, serotonylation, has been shown to be involved in a variety of physiological processes. Therefore, we investigated whether serotonylation is involved in 5HTs regulation of PTHrP in the mammary gland. Using lactogenic differentiated mouse mammary epithelial cells, we studied the effect of increased intracellular 5HT using the antidepressant, fluoxetine [FLX], or 5-hydroxytryptophan ([5HTP] 5HT precursor) with or without transglutaminase inhibition on PTHrP induction and activity and the potential serotonylation target protein, RhoA. Treatment with FLX or 5HTP significantly increased intracellular 5HT concentration and subsequently increased PTHrP gene expression which was reduced with transglutaminase inhibition. Further, we demonstrated that transglutaminase becomes more active with lactogenic differentiation and with 5HTP or FLX treatment. We examined RhoA, Rac1, and Rab4 as potential serotonylation target proteins and have concluded RhoA is likely a serotonylation target protein. Our data suggest that 5HT regulates PTHrP induction in part through the process of serotonylation during lactation.",

We show experimental measurements and simulations of uLFPs in neocortex and hippocampus, for both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We fit a \"kernel\" function to measurements of uLFPs, and we estimate its spatial and temporal spread by using simulations of morphologically detailed reconstructions of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Assuming that LFPs are the sum of uLFPs generated by every neuron in the network, the LFP generated by excitatory and inhibitory neurons can be calculated by convolving the trains of action potentials with the kernels estimated from uLFPs. This provides a method to calculate the LFP from networks of spiking neurons, even for point neurons for which the LFP is not easily defined.

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) enables fast, free, and highly controllable experimental body image setting. Illusions pertaining to a body, like the rubber hand illusion (RHI), can be easily conducted in VR settings, and some phenomena, such as full-body illusions, are only realized in virtual environments. However, the multisensory integration process in VR is not yet fully understood, and we must clarify the limitations and whether specific phenomena can also occur in real life or only in VR settings. One useful investigative approach is measuring brain activities during a psychological experiment. Electroencephalography (EEG) oscillatory activities provide insight into the human multisensory integration process. Unfortunately, the data can be vulnerable to VR noise, which causes measurement and analytical difficulties for EEG data recorded in VR environments. Here, we took care to provide an experimental RHI setting using a head-mounted display, which provided a VR visual space and VR dummy hand along with EEG measurements. We compared EEG data taken in both real and VR environments and observed the gamma and theta band oscillatory activities. Ultimately, we saw statistically significant differences between congruent (RHI) and incongruent (not RHI) conditions in the real environment, which agrees with previous studies. No difference in the VR condition could be observed, suggesting that the VR setting itself altered the perceptual and sensory integration mechanisms. Thus, we must model this difference between real and VR settings whenever we use VR to investigate our bodily self-perception.",

We recently showed that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-mediated PrP suppression extends survival and delays disease onset in intracerebrally prion-infected mice in both prophylactic and delayed dosing paradigms. Here, we examine the efficacy of this therapeutic approach across diverse paradigms, varying the dose and dosing regimen, prion strain, treatment timepoint, and examining symptomatic, survival, and biomarker readouts. We recapitulate our previous findings with additional PrP-targeting ASOs, and demonstrate therapeutic benefit against four additional prion strains. We demonstrate that less than 25% PrP suppression is sufficient to extend survival and delay symptoms in a prophylactic paradigm. Rise in both neuroinflammation and neuronal injury markers can be reversed by a single dose of PrP-lowering ASO administered after the detection of pathological change. Chronic ASO-mediated suppression of PrP beginning at any time up to early signs of neuropathology confers benefit similar to constitutive heterozygous PrP knockout. Remarkably, even after emergence of frank symptoms including weight loss, a single treatment prolongs survival by months in a subset of animals. These results support ASO-mediated PrP lowering, and PrP-lowering therapeutics in general, as a promising path forward against prion disease.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are often initiated from neuronal injury or disease and propagated through neuroinflammation and immune response. However, the mechanisms by which injured neurons induce neuroinflammation and immune response that feedback to damage neurons are largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Arf1 ablation in adult mouse neurons resulted in activation of a reactive microglia-A1 astrocyte-C3 pathway in the hindbrain and midbrain but not in the forebrain, which caused demyelination, axon degeneration, synapse loss, and neurodegeneration. We further find that the Arf1-ablated neurons released peroxided lipids and ATP that activated an NLRP3 inflammasome in microglia to release IL-1{beta}, which together with elevated chemokines recruited and activated {gamma}{delta}T cells in meninges. The activated {gamma}{delta} T cells then secreted IFN{gamma} that entered into parenchyma to activate the microglia-A1 astrocyte-C3 neurotoxic pathway for destroying neurons and oligodendrocytes. Finally, we show that the Arf1-reduction-induced neuroinflammation-IFN{gamma}-gliosis pathway exists in human neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis. This study illustrates perhaps the first complete mechanism of neurodegeneration in a mouse model. Our findings introduce a new paradigm in neurodegenerative research and provide new opportunities to treat neurodegenerative disorders.",

However, \u201cnon-self\u201d incompatibility of recipient biological systems is often not considered, for example, when rodents are used as a model organism for preclinical studies of biomolecule-inspired nanomedicines. Using zebrafish embryos as an emerging model for nano-bioimaging, here we unraveled the in vivo fate of intravenously injected 70 nm SiO2 nanoparticles with a protein corona pre-formed from fetal bovine serum (FBS), representing a non-self biological identity. Strikingly rapid sequestration and endolysosomal acidification of nanoparticles with the pre-formed FBS corona were observed in scavenger endothelial cells within minutes after injection. This led to loss of blood vessel integrity and inflammatory activation of macrophages over the course of several hours. As unmodified nanoparticles or the equivalent dose of FBS proteins alone failed to induce the observed pathophysiology, this signifies how the corona enriched with a differential repertoire of proteins can determine the fate of the nanoparticles in vivo. Our findings thus reveal the adverse outcome triggered by incompatible protein coronas and indicate a potential pitfall in the use of mismatched species combinations during nanomedicine development.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

These species have experienced dramatic declines over the last century and are currently threatened in many portions of their ranges. Therefore, improved tools for detecting and monitoring these species are needed. Species-specificity and sensitivity of assays were empirically tested in the lab, and multiplex assays were also validated with field collected eDNA samples. All assays were species-specific, sensitive, and effective for detection from eDNA samples collected from streams and rivers. These assays will aid in the detection, monitoring, management, and conservation of these vulnerable species.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Approximately 15% of Colon Cancers are Microsatellite Instable (MSI). Frameshift Peptides (FPs) formed in MSI Colon Cancer are potential targets for immunotherapeutic strategies. Here we comprehensively characterize the mutational landscape of 71 MSI Colon Cancer patients from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA-COAD). We confirm that the mutations in MSI Colon Cancers are frequently frameshift deletions (23% in MSI; 1% in microsatellite stable), We find that these mutations cluster at specific locations in the genome which are mutated in up to 41% of the patients. We filter these for an adequate variant allele frequency, a sufficient mean mRNA level and the formation of a Super Neo Open Reading Frame (SNORF). Finally, we check the influence of Nonsense Mediated Decay by comparing RNA and DNA sequencing results. Thereby we identify a set of 20 NMD-escaping Public FPs (PFPs) that cover over 90% of MSI Colon Cancer patients and 3 out of 4 Lynch patients in the TCGA-COAD. This underlines the potential for PFP directed immunotherapy, both in a therapeutic and a prophylactic setting.",

    "abstract": "We evaluated seasonal variation in taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity and redundancy of tadpoles in 401 points of 10 ponds in southern Brazil. We predicted i) congruent patterns between all components of diversity and environmental descriptors; ii) stronger effects of environment in the diversity components in seasons when the water level in ponds is low; iii) diversity components to be influenced by distinct sets of environmental factors in different periods. Predictions were tested using Linear Mixed Models. We observed positive influence of water depth on taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, as well as on functional redundancy during periods when the water level in ponds is high. Phylogenetic redundancy was not explained by any of the selected environmental variables. When the water level in ponds is low none of the environmental descriptors affects any of the diversity components. Environmental filtering seems to strongly influence tadpole community structure in temporary ponds, at least in periods when water depth gradients create a variety of micro-habitats allowing diverse sets of species to settle and co-occur. These species sets are then filtered according to their swimming and foraging abilities along the depth gradient, where intermediate depths should contain the greatest tadpole diversity.",

    "abstract": "Visual object recognition in humans and nonhuman primates is achieved by the ventral visual pathway (ventral occipital-temporal cortex, VOTC), which shows a well-documented object domain structure. An on-going question has been what type of information is processed in higher-order VOTC that underlies such observations, with recent evidence suggesting effects of certain visual features. Combining computational vision models, fMRI experiment using a parametric-modulation approach, and natural image statistics of common objects, we depicted the neural distribution of a comprehensive set of visual features in VOTC, identifying voxel sensitivities to specific feature sets across geometry/shape, Fourier power, and color. The visual feature combination pattern in VOTC is significantly explained by their relationships to different types of response-action computation (Fight-or-Flight, Navigation, and Manipulation), as derived from behavioral ratings and natural image statistics. These results offer the first comprehensive visual featural map in VOTC and a plausible theoretical explanation as a mapping onto different types of downstream response-action systems.",

    "abstract": "Additional gravitational cues generated by active body movements may play a role in the perception of gravitational space, but no experimental evidence has been shown on this. To investigate this possibility, we evaluated how arm movements made against gravity influenced the perceptual distortion of visual and postural vertical induced by prolonged whole-body tilt. In Experiment 1, participants were asked to perform static or dynamic arm movements during prolonged whole-body tilt and we assessed their effects on subjective visual vertical (SVV) at the tilt position (during-tilt session) and after tilting back to the upright position (post-tilt session). In Experiment 2, we evaluated how static or dynamic arm movements during prolonged tilt subsequently affected the subjective postural vertical (SPV). In Experiment 1, we observed that prolonged tilt induced the SVV shifts toward the side of body tilts in both sessions. The prolonged tilt-induced SVV shifts effectively decreased when performing dynamic arm movements in the during-tilt session, but not in the post-tilt session. In Experiment 2, the SPV shifted toward the side of prolonged body tilt, which was not significantly influenced by the performance of static or dynamic arm movements. Results of the during-tilt session suggest that the central nervous system utilizes additional cues generated by dynamic body movements for the perception of the visual vertical.",

To determine whether experience with predators influences these aspects, we compared the behavior of Gryllodes sigillatus before and after exposure to live predators. We found that emergence from shelter and distance moved during open-field trials (activity) changed after exposure, with individuals becoming less likely to emerge from shelters but more active when deprived of shelter. We also found that plasticity in activity increased after exposure to predators and some indications that differences among individuals (i.e. \"personality\") in emergence from shelter and the amount of an arena investigated increased after exposure. Our results demonstrate that experience with predators affects not only the average behavior of individuals but also how individuals differ from each other--and their own prior behavior--even when all individuals have the same experiences.",

    "abstract": "Structural variation (SV), which ranges from 50 bp to [~]3 Mb in size, is an important type of genetic variations. Deletion is a type of SV in which a part of a chromosome or a sequence of DNA is lost during DNA replication. Three types of signals, including discordant read-pairs, reads depth and split reads, are commonly used for SV detection from high-throughput sequence data. Many tools have been developed for detecting SVs by using one or multiple of these signals. In this paper, we develop a new method called EigenDel for detecting genomic deletions. EigenDel first takes advantage of discordant read-pairs and clipped reads to get initial deletion candidates, and then it clusters similar candidates by using unsupervised learning methods. After that, EigenDel uses a carefully designed approach for calling true deletions from each cluster. We conduct various experiments to evaluate the performance of EigenDel on low coverage sequence data. Our results show that EigenDel outperforms other major methods in terms of improving capability of balancing accuracy and sensitivity as well as reducing bias.

    "abstract": "Spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models have become the preferred tool for estimating densities of carnivores. Within this family of models are variants requiring identification of all individuals in each encounter (SCR), a subset of individuals only (generalized spatial mark-resight, gSMR), or no individual identification (spatial count or spatial presence-absence). Although each technique has been shown through simulation to yield unbiased results, the consistency and relative precision of estimates across methods in real-world settings are seldom considered. We tested a suite of models ranging from those only requiring detections of unmarked individuals to others that integrate remote camera, physical capture, genetic, and global positioning system (GPS) data into a  hybrid model, to estimate population densities of black bears, bobcats, cougars, and coyotes. For each species we genotyped fecal DNA collected with detection dogs during a 20-day period. A subset of individuals from each species was affixed with GPS collars bearing unique markings and resighted by remote cameras over 140 days contemporaneous with scat collection. Camera-based gSMR models produced density estimates that differed by less than 10% from genetic SCR for bears, cougars, and coyotes once important sources of variation (sex or behavioral status) were controlled for. For bobcats, SCR estimates were 33% higher than gSMR. The cause of the discrepancies in estimates was likely attributable to challenges designing a study compatible for species with disparate home range sizes and the difficulty of collecting sufficient data in a timeframe in which demographic closure could be assumed. Unmarked models estimated densities that varied greatly from SCR, but estimates became more consistent in models wherein more individuals were identifiable. Hybrid models containing all data sources exhibited the most precise estimates for all species. For studies in which only sparse data can be obtained and the strictest model assumptions are unlikely to be met, we suggest researchers use caution making inference from models lacking individual identity. For best results, we further recommend the use of methods requiring at least a subset of the population is marked and that multiple datasets are incorporated when possible.",

    "abstract": "The dorsal striatum plays a central role in motor and decision programs, such as the selection and execution of particular actions and the evaluation of their outcomes. A standard model has emerged where distinct output pathways encode separate motor-action signals, including selection-evaluation division in the matrix versus patch compartments. We used large-scale cell-type specific calcium imaging during motor and decision behaviors to determine and contrast the activity of individual striatal projection neurons (SPNs) belonging to one of the three major output pathways in the dorsomedial striatum - patch Oprm1+ SPNs versus the D1+ direct and A2A+ indirect pathway. We found that Oprm1+ SPNs were tuned to a number of different behavioral categories, such as to different movements, or to discrete actions and decisions in a two-choice task, and these complex representations were found to the same extent in all three striatal output pathways. The sharp tuning of individual SPNs was highly stereotyped over time while performing a specific task, but the tuning profile remapped between different behavioral contexts. In addition to action representations, SPNs showed pathway-independent representation of decision-variables such as the trial strategy and the action value. We propose that all three major output pathways in the dorsomedial striatum share a similarly complete representation of the entire action space, including task- and phase-specific signals of action value and choice.",

Telomeres represent a compelling biomarker of individual radiosensitivity and risk, as exposure can result in dysfunctional telomere pathologies that coincidentally overlap with many radiation-induced late effects, ranging from degenerative conditions like fibrosis and cardiovascular disease to proliferative pathologies like cancer. Here, telomere length was longitudinally assessed in a cohort of fifteen prostate cancer patients undergoing Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) utilizing Telomere Fluorescence in situ Hybridization (Telo-FISH). To evaluate genome instability and enhance predictions for individual patient risk of secondary malignancy, chromosome aberrations were also assessed utilizing directional Genomic Hybridization (dGH) for high-resolution inversion detection. We present the first implementation of individual telomere length data in a machine learning model, XGBoost, trained on pre-radiotherapy (baseline) and in vitro exposed (4 Gy {gamma}-rays) telomere length measures, to predict post-radiotherapy telomeric outcomes, which together with chromosomal instability provide insight into individual radiosensitivity and risk for radiation-induced late effects.",

Memory formation is generally attributed to Hebbian plasticity, while homeostatic plasticity is thought to have an ancillary role in stabilizing network dynamics. Here we report that homeostatic plasticity alone can also lead to the formation of stable memories. We analyze this phenomenon using a new theory of network remodeling, combined with numerical simulations of recurrent spiking neural networks that exhibit structural plasticity based on firing rate homeostasis. These networks are able to store repeatedly presented patterns and recall them upon the presentation of incomplete cues. Storage is fast, governed by the homeostatic drift. In contrast, forgetting is slow, driven by a diffusion process. Joint stimulation of neurons induces the growth of associative connections between them, leading to the formation of memory engrams. These memories are stored in a distributed fashion throughout connectivity matrix, and individual synaptic connections have only a small influence. Although memory-specific connections are increased in number, the total number of inputs and outputs of neurons undergo only small changes during stimulation. We find that homeostatic structural plasticity induces a specific type of \"silent memories\", different from conventional attractor states.",

By this, the auditory system could adapt to changes of the auditory input at second or even sub-second timescales. In case of reduced auditory input, somatosensory projections to the dorsal cochlear nucleus would be disinhibited in order to improve hearing thresholds by means of SR. As a side effect, the increased somatosensory input corresponding to the observed tinnitus-associated neuronal hyperactivity is then perceived as tinnitus. In addition, the model can also explain transient phantom tone perceptions occurring after ear plugging, or the Zwicker tone illusion. Vice versa, the model predicts that via stimulation with acoustic noise, SR would not be needed to optimize information transmission, and hence somatosensory noise would be tuned down, resulting in a transient vanishing of tinnitus, an effect referred to as residual inhibition.",

However, interrogating deep brain structures, implanting multiple targets or aiming at unusual angles still poses significant challenges even for expert operators, and errors are only discovered by post-hoc histological reconstruction. Here, we propose a method combining the high-resolution information about bone landmarks provided by micro-CT scanning with the soft tissue contrast of the MRI, which allowed us to precisely localize electrodes and optic fibers in mice in vivo. This enables arbitrating the success of implantation directly after surgery with a precision comparable to the gold standard histological reconstruction. Adjustment of the recording depth with electrode microdrives or early termination of unsuccessful experiments saves many working hours, while fast 3-dimensional feedback helps surgeons to avoid systematic errors. Increased aiming precision will allow more precise targeting of small or deep brain nuclei and multiple targeting of specific cortical layers.",

To this end, we conducted a whole-brain voxel based morphometry following current recommendations on analysis approaches, coupled with rigorous neuropsychological testing, to characterize the associations between neuroanatomy and skills vital for reading in DD. We found decreased volumes of grey matter in DD, comprising a left-hemispheric network including superior temporal and inferior frontal gyri, insula, the limbic system, and basal ganglia, and white matter, including the right middle temporal gyrus and hippocampus, as well as the right precuneus. These results are both consistent with the most robust previous findings on cortical abnormalities in DD and yield novel insight to the role of subcortical structures in DD, scarcely studied so far. Crucially, areas with decreased grey matter in DD overlapped with brain areas associated with technical reading skills. This supports the conclusion that the grey matter regions that we identified to have a low volume in DD are associated with the core areas vital for reading.",

    "abstract": "Effectively minimizing head motion continues to be a challenge for the collection of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The use of individual-specific custom molded headcases is a promising solution to this issue, but there has been limited work to date. In the present work, we examine the efficacy of headcases in a larger group of participants engaged in naturalistic scanning paradigms including: long movie-watching scans ([~]20-45min) and a recall task that involved talking aloud inside the MRI. Unlike previous work, we find that headcases do not reliably reduce motion during movie viewing compared to alternative methods such as foam pillows or foam pillows plus medical tape. Surprisingly, we also find that motion is worse when participants talk aloud while wearing headcases. These differences appear to be driven by large, brief rotations of the head as well as translations in the z-plane as participants speak. Smaller, constant head movements appear equivalent with or without headcases. The largest reductions in head motion are observable when participants were situated with both foam pillows and medical tape. Altogether, this work suggests that in a healthy adult population, custom-molded headcases may provide limited efficacy in reducing head motion beyond existing tools available to researchers. We hope this work can help improve the quality of custom headcases, motivate the investigation of additional solutions, and provide additional information about head motion in naturalistic contexts.",

    "abstract": "The present study was focused on the concentration dependent changes in oral acute toxicity of leaf extracts of E. fluctuans in zebrafish. The study was also aimed at the details of histopathological changes in gill, liver, brain and intestine of zebrafish exposed to the leaf extracts of the plant E. fluctuans. Enydra fluctuans Lour is an edible semi-aquatic herbaceous plant used widely for the alleviation of the different diseases. Since there were no toxicity studies conducted on this plant the present study was an attempt to look into the elements of toxicity of the plants. Two types of experiments are conducted in the present study. First, the acute oral toxicity study was conducted as per the OECD guidelines 203. Second, histopathological changes were observed in the fishes exposed to the lethal concentrations of plant extract. The oral acute toxicity studies conducted on Zebrafish have revealed that the leave extracts of E. fluctuans were toxic to the tested fish at the concentration of 200 mg/kg body weight. The histopathological studies conducted on intestine of treated fishes showed that treatment has induced rupturing of villi structure and fusion of villi membrane and detachment of villi structure from basal membrane of intestine. The histology of the liver also showed severe vacuolization in the cells while it is not affected in control. The studies on gills showed the detachment of basal epithelial membrane in gills compared to control which might have led to death of the fish. The histopathological observations of brain tissues treated with test samples also revealed the marked impingement in brain parenchyma while the control is normal without impingement of brain.",

    "abstract": "Dioxins are highly toxic environmental persistent organic pollutants. In several countries, their presence was also reported in cow and human milk samples in the range of 0.023-26.46 and 0.88-19.0 pg/gm of fat, respectively. The detection of dioxns in food samples has been relied on several expensive technologies, which do not represent their toxic effects on consumers. However, mammalian cell based bioassays have such potential to detect the toxins, while representing their toxic effects. Therefore, we tried a three-dimensionally (3D) cultured buffalo granulosa cell based RT-LAMP colour reaction for detecting the presence of added model dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), in commercial milk. The 3D spheroids on the fifth day of culture were treated with different concentrations of TCDD (i.e. 0.02- 20 pg/ml) directly as well as indirectly through milk fat. After 24hrs of treatment, gene expression studies were performed on certain granulosa cell-specific (CYP19A1, ER-beta, FSHR and LHR) and selective TCDD-responsive (CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and AHR) genes to identify the potential dioxin responsive gene for further RT-LAMP reaction. As the AHR expression in 3D cultured buffalo granulosa cells appears to be a potential gene marker for sensing the added TCDD in the milk, a colour based RT-LAMP reaction was successfully attempted for its expression. However, future studies are needed to develop a dose-responsive colour reaction by considering the treatment time less than 24 hrs.",

    "abstract": "Oral nintedanib is marketed for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). While effective slowing fibrosis progression, as an oral medicine nintedanib is limited. To reduce side effects and maximize efficacy, nintedanib was reformulated as a solution for nebulization and inhaled administration. To predict effectiveness treating IPF, the nintedanib pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship was dissected. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated oral-delivered nintedanib plasma exposure and lung tissue partitioning were not dose-proportional and resulting lung levels were substantially higher than blood. Although initial-oral absorbed nintedanib efficiently partitioned into the lung, only a quickly eliminated fraction appeared available to epithelial lining fluid (ELF). Because IPF disease appears to initiate and progress near the epithelial surface, this observation suggests short duration nintedanib exposure (oral portion efficiently partitioned to ELF) is sufficient for IPF efficacy. To test this hypothesis, exposure duration required for nintedanib activity was explored. In vitro, IPF-cellular matrix (IPF-CM) increased primary normal human fibroblast (nHLF) aggregate size and reduced nHLF cell count. IPF-CM also increased nHLF ACTA2 and COL1A expression. Whether short duration (inhalation mimic) or continuous exposure (oral mimic), nintedanib (1-100 nM) reversed these effects. In vivo, intubated silica produced a strong pulmonary fibrotic response. Once-daily (QD) 0.021, 0.21 and 2.1 mg/kg intranasal (IN; short duration inhaled exposure) and twice daily (BID) 30 mg/kg oral (PO; long duration oral exposure) showed that at equivalent-delivered lung concentrations, QD short duration inhaled nintedanib exposure (0.21 mg/kg IN vs. 30 mg/kg PO) exhibited equivalent-to-superior activity as BID oral (reduced silica-induced elastance, alpha-smooth muscle actin, interleukin-1 beta (IL-1{beta}) and soluble collagen, and lung macrophage and neutrophils). An increased lung dose (2.1 mg/kg IN vs. 30 mg/kg PO) exhibited increased effect by further reducing silica-induced elastance, IL-1{beta} and soluble collagen. Neither oral nor inhaled nintedanib reduced silica-induced parenchymal collagen. Both QD inhaled and BID oral nintedanib reduced silica-induced inflammatory index with oral achieving significance. In summary, nintedanib pulmonary anti-fibrotic activity can be achieved using small, infrequent inhaled doses to deliver oral equivalent-to-superior therapeutic effect.",

    "abstract": "PurposeMucus abnormalities are central to the pathophysiology of several chronic airway diseases. Mucus secretion and clearance are regulated, in part, by cholinergic innervation. Prolonged cholinergic stimulation may contribute to mucus abnormalities in disease. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that prolonged cholinergic stimulation gives rise to lasting mucus abnormalities in airways.\n\nMethodsWe delivered aerosolized bethanechol, a cholinergic agonist, to pig airways. Forty-eight hours later, we measured mucus secretion and mucociliary transport in tracheal segments ex vivo. Tracheal and bronchoalveolar lavage concentrations of the major secreted mucus glycoproteins, mucin5B (MUC5B) or mucin5AC (MUC5AC), were measured with ELISA and antibody labeling. Pig airway epithelia were cultured at the air-liquid interface and treated with bethanechol for forty-eight hours. Stimulated fluid secretion was measured with reflected microscopy and Ussing chambers were used to measure ion transport.\n\nResultsAirways from bethanechol-challenged pigs exhibited sheet-like mucus films, which were not associated with a greater abundance of MUC5AC or MUC5B. Epithelia treated with bethanechol had diminished fluid secretion and decreased Cl- transport. However, mucus and fluid alterations were not associated with impaired mucociliary transport.\n\nConclusionsThese data suggest that cholinergic transmission induces sustained alterations in airway mucus properties. Such defects might compound and/or contribute to persistent mucus phenotypes found after the resolution of airway inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Hair glucocorticoids are increasingly popular biomarkers, used across numerous research fields as a measure of stress. Although they are suggested to be a proxy of the average HPA axis activity spanning a period of weeks or months into the past, this theory has never been tested.\n\nIn the present study, adrenalectomized rats with no endogenous (adrenal) glucocorticoid production were used to study how circulating glucocorticoid levels would be reflected in the glucocorticoid levels found in hair samples. By dosing the animals daily with high levels of corticosterone for seven days, while sampling hairs before, during, and after treatments, a timeline for glucocorticoid uptake into hairs was constructed. This kinetic profile was compared to two hypothetical models, and the theory that hair glucocorticoids are a record of historical stress had to be rejected.\n\nCorticosterone concentrations in hairs were found to increase within three hours of the first injection, the highest concentrations were found on the seventh day of treatments, and the decrease in concentrations post-treatment suggests rapid elimination. We speculate that hair glucocorticoid levels can only be used to characterize a stress-response for a few days following a postulated stressor.\n\nAn updated model, where glucocorticoids diffuse into, along, and out of hairs needs to be adopted to reconcile the experimentally obtained data. The inescapable consequence of this updated model is that hair glucocorticoids become a marker of - and can only be used to study - recent, or ongoing, stress, as opposed to historical events, weeks or months in the past.",

Despite the recent renaissance in unsupervised neural networks for decoding unstructured natural languages, a platform for the real-time synthesis of the exponentially growing biomedical literature and its comprehensive triangulation with deep omic insights is not available. Here, we present the nferX platform for dynamic inference from over 45 quadrillion possible conceptual associations extracted from unstructured biomedical text, and their triangulation with Single Cell RNA-sequencing based insights from over 25 tissues. Using this platform, we identify intersections between the pathologic manifestations of COVID-19 and the comprehensive expression profile of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We find that tongue keratinocytes, airway club cells, and ciliated cells are likely underappreciated targets of SARS-CoV-2 infection, in addition to type II pneumocytes and olfactory epithelial cells. We further identify mature small intestinal enterocytes as a possible hotspot of COVID-19 fecal-oral transmission, where an intriguing maturation-correlated transcriptional signature is shared between ACE2 and the other coronavirus receptors DPP4 (MERS-CoV) and ANPEP (-coronavirus). This study demonstrates how a holistic data science platform can leverage unprecedented quantities of structured and unstructured publicly available data to accelerate the generation of impactful biological insights and hypotheses.\n\nThe nferX Platform Single-cell resource - https://academia.nferx.com/",

Given recent interest in using amyloid {beta} (A{beta})-targeted antibodies as a therapy for patients with Alzheimers disease, removal of A{beta} by phagocytosis is likely protective early in Alzheimers disease, but remains poorly understood. Impaired phagocytic function of glial cells surrounding A{beta} plaques during later stages in Alzheimers disease likely contributes to worsened disease outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms of how this occurs remain unknown. We have developed a human A{beta}1-42 analogue (A{beta}pH) that exhibits green fluorescence upon internalization into the acidic phagosomes of cells but is non-fluorescent at physiological pH. This allowed us to image, for the first time, glial uptake of A{beta}pH in real time in live animals. Microglia phagocytose more A{beta}pH than astrocytes in culture, in brain slices and in vivo. A{beta}pH can be used to investigate the phagocytic mechanisms removing A{beta} from the extracellular space, and thus could become a useful tool to study A{beta} clearance at different stages of Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Sex hormones alter the organization of the brain during early development and coordinate various behaviors throughout life. In zebra finches, song learning is limited to males, and the associated song learning brain pathway only matures in males and atrophies in females. This atrophy can be reversed by giving females exogenous estrogen during early post-hatch development, but whether normal male song system development requires estrogen is uncertain. For the first time in songbirds, we administered exemestane, a potent third generation estrogen synthesis inhibitor, from the day of hatching until adulthood. We examined the behavior, brain, and transcriptome of individual song nuclei of these pharmacologically manipulated animals. We found that males with long-term exemestane treatment had diminished male-specific plumage, impaired song learning, but retained normal song nuclei sizes and most, but not all, of their specialized transcriptome. Consistent with prior findings, females with long-term estrogen treatment retained a functional song system, and we further observed their song nuclei had specialized gene expression profiles similar, but not identical to males. We also observed that different song nuclei responded to estrogen manipulation differently, with Area X in the striatum being the most altered by estrogen modulation. These findings support the hypothesis that song learning is an ancestral trait in both sexes, which was subsequently suppressed in females of some species, and that estrogen has come to play a critical role in modulating this suppression as well as refinement of song learning.",

    "abstract": "Processing of sensory information is substantially modulated by centrifugal projections from higher cortical areas, yet their behavioral relevance and underlying neural mechanisms remain unclear in most cases. The anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) is part of the olfactory cortex and its extensive connections to lower and higher brain centers put it in a prime position to modulate early sensory information in the olfactory system. Here, we show that optogenetic activation of AON neurons in awake animals was not perceived as an odorant equivalent cue. However, AON activation during odorant presentation reliably suppressed odor responses. This AON mediated effect was fast and constant across odors and concentrations. Likewise, activation of glutamatergic AON projections to the olfactory bulb (OB) transiently inhibited the excitability of mitral/tufted cells (MTCs) that relay olfactory input to cortex. Single-unit MTC recordings revealed that optogenetic activation of glutamatergic AON terminals in the OB transiently decreased sensory-evoked MTC spiking, regardless of the strength or polarity of the sensory response. These findings suggest that glutamatergic AON projections to the OB suppress early olfactory processing by inhibiting OB output neurons and that the AON can dynamically gate sensory throughput to the cortex.\n\nSignificance StatementThe anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) as an olfactory information processing area sends extensive projections to lower and higher brain centers but the behavioral consequences of its activation have been scarcely investigated. Using behavioral tests in combination with optogenetic manipulation we show that in contrast to what has been suggested previously, the AON does not seem to form odor percepts but instead suppresses odor responses across odorants and concentrations. Furthermore, this study shows that glutamatergic cortical projections to the olfactory bulb suppress olfactory processing by inhibiting output neurons, pointing to a potential mechanisms by which the olfactory cortex can actively and dynamically gate sensory throughput to higher brain centers.\n\nHighlightsAON stimulation suppresses odor responses across odorants and concentrations\n\nAON activation is not perceived as an odorant equivalent cue\n\nThe AON dynamically shapes olfactory bulb output on a fast timescale\n\nAON input to the olfactory bulb strongly suppresses mitral/tufted cells firing",

    "abstract": "Tauopathies is a class of neurodegenerative disorders which involves the transformation of physiological tau into pathogenic tau. One of the prime causes reported to drive this conversion is tau hyperphosphorylation and the subsequent propagation of pathogenic protein aggregates across the nervous system. Although past attempts have been made to deduce the details of tau propagation, yet not much is known about its mechanism. A better understanding of this aspect of disease pathology can prove to be beneficial for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In our work, we utilize the plethora of advantages procured by Drosophila to introduce a novel in-vivo tauopathy propagation model. For the first time, we demonstrate that the human tau (h-tau) possesses an intrinsic property to spread trans-cellularly in the fly nervous system irrespective of the tau allele or the neuronal tissue type. Aggregate migration restricted by targeted down-regulation of a specific kinase, elucidates the role of hyper-phosphorylation in its movement. On the contrary to the previous models, the present system enables a rapid, convenient and robust in-vivo study of tau migration pathology. Henceforth, the developed model would not only be immensely helpful in uncovering the mechanistic in-depths of tau propagation pathology but also aid in modifier and/or drug screening for amelioration of tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "Basal forebrain modulation of central circuits is associated with active sensation, attention and learning. While cholinergic modulations have been studied extensively the effect of non-cholinergic basal forebrain subpopulations on sensory processing remains largely unclear. Here, we directly compare optogenetic manipulation effects of two major basal forebrain subpopulations on principal neuron activity in an early sensory processing area, i.e. mitral/tufted cells (MTCs) in the olfactory bulb. In contrast to cholinergic projections, which consistently increased MTC firing, activation of GABAergic fibers from basal forebrain to the olfactory bulb lead to differential modulation effects: while spontaneous MTC activity is mainly inhibited, odor evoked firing is predominantly enhanced. Moreover, sniff triggered averages revealed an enhancement of maximal sniff evoked firing amplitude and an inhibition of firing rates outside the maximal sniff phase. These findings demonstrate that GABAergic neuromodulation affects MTC firing in a bimodal, sensory-input dependent way, suggesting that GABAergic basal forebrain modulation could be an important factor in attention mediated filtering of sensory information to the brain.",

    "abstract": "Local stresses on the cancer cells (CCs) have been measured by embedding inert tracer particles (TPs) in a growing multicellular spheroid. The utility of the experiments requires that the TPs do not alter the CC microenvironment. We show, using theory and extensive simulations, that proliferation and apoptosis of the CCs, drive the dynamics of the TPs far from equilibrium. On times less than the CC division times, the TPs exhibit sub-diffusive behavior (the mean square displacement, [Formula] with {beta}TP < 1). Surprisingly, in the long-time limit, the motion of the TPs is hyper-diffusive ([Formula] with TP > 2) due to persistent directed motion for a number of CC division times. In contrast, CC proliferation randomizes their motion resulting from jamming at short times to super-diffusive behavior, with CC exceeding unity, at long times. Surprisingly, the effect of the TPs on CC dynamics and radial pressure is negligible, suggesting that the TPs are reliable reporters of the CC microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Intratumoral heterogeneity is a hallmark of diffuse gliomas. We used neuronavigation to acquire 133 image-guided and spatially-separated stereotactic biopsy samples from 16 adult patients with a diffuse glioma, which we characterized using DNA methylation arrays. Samples were obtained from regions with and without imaging abnormalities. Methylation profiles were analyzed to devise a three-dimensional reconstruction of genetic and epigenetic heterogeneity. Molecular aberrations indicated that tumor was found outside imaging abnormalities, underlining the infiltrative nature of this tumor and the limitations of current routine imaging modalities. We demonstrate that tumor purity is highly variable between samples and largely explains apparent epigenetic spatial heterogeneity. Indeed, we observed that DNA methylation subtypes are highly conserved in space after adjusting for tumor purity. Genome-wide heterogeneity analysis showed equal or increased heterogeneity among normal tissue when compared to tumor. These findings were validated in a separate cohort of 61 multi-sector tumor and 64 normal samples. Our findings underscore the infiltrative nature of diffuse gliomas and suggest that heterogeneity in DNA methylation is innate to somatic cells and not a characteristic feature of this tumor type.",

    "abstract": "The Deinococcus radiodurans multipartite genome system (MGS) consists of chromosome I (ChrI) and secondary genome elements; Chr II and megaplasmid (MP). The sequences upstream to parAB operons in Chr II (cisII) and MP (cisMP) helped an E. coli plasmid maintenance in D. radiodurans and showed sequence specific interactions with DnaA and ParBs. The cells devoid of cisII ({Delta}cisII) or cisMP ({Delta}cisMP) showed reduced {gamma} radiation resistance and copy number of Chr II and MP. Fluorescent Reporter-Operator System (FROS) developed for ChrI, ChrII and MP in {Delta}cisII or {Delta}cisMP mutants showed no change in wild type pattern of Chr I localization. However, the relative copy numbers of Chr II and MP had reduced while anucleate cells had increased in mutants. These results suggested that cisII and cisMP elements contain both ori and centromere-like functions, and like other MGS bacteria, the Chr I and secondary genome are maintained independently in D. radiodurans.",
