    "abstract": "Eye-to-eye contact is a salient cue for regulating everyday social interaction and communication. Previous research has demonstrated that direct eye contact between actor and observer specifically enhances the  mirroring of others actions in the observer, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced motor evoked potentials (MEPs; an index of motor cortex excitability during action observation). However, it remains unknown whether other markers of mirror system activation, such as suppression of the EEG mu rhythm (i.e. attenuation of neural oscillations in the 8-13 Hz frequency band over the sensorimotor strip), are also susceptible to perceived eye contact. In the current study, a multimodal approach was adopted to assess both TMS-induced MEPs and EEG mu suppression (in separate sessions), while 32 participants (20 men; mean age: 24;8 years) observed a simple hand movement in combination with direct or averted gaze from the live stimulus person. Both indices of mirror system functioning were significantly modulated by perceived eye gaze; showing a significant increase in MEP amplitude and a significant attenuation of the mu rhythm when movement observation was accompanied with direct compared to averted gaze. Importantly, while inter-individual differences in absolute MEP and mu suppression scores were not significantly related, a significant association was identified between gaze-related changes in MEP responses and mu suppression. As such, it appears that while the neurophysiological substrates underlying mu suppression and TMS-induced MEP responses differ, both are similarly affected by the modulatory impact of gaze-related cues. In sum, our results suggest that both EEG mu rhythm and TMS-induced MEPs are sensitive to the social relevance of the observed actions, and that a similar neural substrate may drive gaze-related changes in these distinct markers of mirror system functioning.",

    "abstract": "Krabbe disease (KD) is caused by a deficiency of galactosylceramidase (GALC), which induces demyelination and neurodegeneration due to accumulation of cytotoxic psychosine. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) improves clinical outcomes in KD patients only if delivered pre-symptomatically. We hypothesized that the restricted temporal efficacy of HSCT reflects a requirement for GALC in early brain development. Using a novel Galc floxed allele, we induced ubiquitous GALC ablation (Galc-iKO) at various postnatal timepoints and identified a critical period of vulnerability to GALC ablation between P4-6. Early Galc-iKO induction caused a worse KD phenotype, higher psychosine levels, and a significantly shorter life-span. Intriguingly, GALC expression peaks during this critical developmental period. Further analysis revealed a novel cell autonomous role for GALC in the development and maturation of immature T-box-brain-1 positive brainstem neurons. These data identify a perinatal developmental period, in which neuronal GALC expression influences brainstem development that is critical for KD pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The auditory dorsal stream (ADS) is a cortical brain network responsible for sensorimotor control and integration, including spatiotemporal processing. Although spatiotemporal movement of the head and body involves input from the vestibular system, and despite the wealth of evidence for the strong coupling between the vestibular and visual systems, very little is known about how vestibular information is integrated with auditory-motor inputs in the ADS. There is also no evidence addressing to what extent auditory-vestibulomotor integration is affected by early visual deprivation. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and motion capture technology we show that in a task of sensorimotor temporal processing ( feeling the beat), the ADS includes an extension to parietoinsular vestibular cortex (PIVC) and to subcortical regions including basal ganglia and vestibular cerebellum. This circuit is engaged after sensorimotor synchronization training, during beat recognition, and is preserved in the early blind. The strength of activation of PIVC in the early blind correlates with a measure of lifetime physical spatial activity, suggesting that experience with vestibular stimulation via physical spatial activities might compensate for any negative effects of early blindness, and thus reinforcing the potential beneficial effects of mobility training. Finally, rhythmic entrainment provides an effective tool for studying auditory-vestibulomotor integration and music appreciation, and for developing music- and movement-based interventions for early blind individuals.",

    "abstract": "Natural images have lawful statistical properties that the adult visual system is sensitive to, both in terms of behavior and neural responses to natural images. The developmental trajectory of sensitivity to natural image statistics remains unclear, however. In behavioral tasks, children appear to slowly acquire adult-like sensitivity to natural image statistics during middle childhood (Ellemberg et al., 2012), but in other tasks, infants exhibit some sensitivity to deviations of natural image structure (Balas & Woods, 2014). Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to examine how sensitivity to natural image statistics changes during childhood at distinct stages of visual processing (the P1 and N1 components). We asked children (5-10 years old) and adults to view natural texture images with either positive/negative contrast, and natural/synthetic texture appearance (Portilla & Simoncelli, 2000) to compare electrophysiological responses to images that did or did not violate natural statistics. We hypothesized that children may only acquire sensitivity to these deviations from natural texture appearance late in middle childhood. Counter to this hypothesis, we observed significant responses to unnatural contrast and texture statistics at the N1 in all age groups. At the P1, however, only young children exhibited sensitivity to contrast polarity. The latter effect suggests greater sensitivity earlier in development to some violations of natural image statistics. We discuss these results in terms of changing patterns of invariant texture processing during middle childhood and ongoing refinement of the representations supporting natural image perception.",

    "abstract": "In proteins, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reacts with redox-sensitive cysteines to form cysteine sulfenic acid, also known as S-sulfenylation. These cysteine oxidation events can steer diverse cellular processes by altering protein interactions, trafficking, conformation, and function. Previously, we had identified S-sulfenylated proteins by using a tagged proteinaceous probe based on the yeast AP-1-like (Yap1) transcription factor that specifically reacts with sulfenic acids and traps them through a mixed disulfide bond. However, the identity of the S-sulfenylated amino acid residues remained enigmatic. Here, we present a technological advancement to identify in situ sulfenylated cysteines directly by means of the transgenic Yap1 probe. In Arabidopsis thaliana cells, after an initial affinity purification and a tryptic digestion, we further enriched the mixed disulfide-linked peptides with an antibody targeting the YAP1C-derived peptide (C598SEIWDR) that entails the redox-active cysteine. Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis with pLink 2 identified 1,745 YAP1C cross-linked peptides, indicating sulfenylated cysteines in over 1,000 proteins. Approximately 55% of these YAP1C-linked cysteines had previously been reported as redox-sensitive cysteines (S-sulfenylation, S-nitrosylation, and reversibly oxidized cysteines). The presented methodology provides a noninvasive approach to identify sulfenylated cysteines in any species that can be genetically modified.",

    "abstract": "The deep population history of East Asia remains poorly understood due to a lack of ancient DNA data and sparse sampling of present-day people. We report genome-wide data from 191 individuals from Mongolia, northern China, Taiwan, the Amur River Basin and Japan dating to 6000 BCE - 1000 CE, many from contexts never previously analyzed with ancient DNA. We also report 383 present-day individuals from 46 groups mostly from the Tibetan Plateau and southern China. We document how 6000-3600 BCE people of Mongolia and the Amur River Basin were from populations that expanded over Northeast Asia, likely dispersing the ancestors of Mongolic and Tungusic languages. In a time transect of 89 Mongolians, we reveal how Yamnaya steppe pastoralist spread from the west by 3300-2900 BCE in association with the Afanasievo culture, although we also document a boy buried in an Afanasievo barrow with ancestry entirely from local Mongolian hunter-gatherers, representing a unique case of someone of entirely non-Yamnaya ancestry interred in this way. The second spread of Yamnaya-derived ancestry came via groups that harbored about a third of their ancestry from European farmers, which nearly completely displaced unmixed Yamnaya-related lineages in Mongolia in the second millennium BCE, but did not replace Afanasievo lineages in western China where Afanasievo ancestry persisted, plausibly acting as the source of the early-splitting Tocharian branch of Indo-European languages. Analyzing 20 Yellow River Basin farmers dating to [~]3000 BCE, we document a population that was a plausible vector for the spread of Sino-Tibetan languages both to the Tibetan Plateau and to the central plain where they mixed with southern agriculturalists to form the ancestors of Han Chinese. We show that the individuals in a time transect of 52 ancient Taiwan individuals spanning at least 1400 BCE to 600 CE were consistent with being nearly direct descendants of Yangtze Valley first farmers who likely spread Austronesian, Tai-Kadai and Austroasiatic languages across Southeast and South Asia and mixing with the people they encountered, contributing to a four-fold reduction of genetic differentiation during the emergence of complex societies. We finally report data from Jomon hunter-gatherers from Japan who harbored one of the earliest splitting branches of East Eurasian variation, and show an affinity among Jomon, Amur River Basin, ancient Taiwan, and Austronesian-speakers, as expected for ancestry if they all had contributions from a Late Pleistocene coastal route migration to East Asia.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe promise of artificial intelligence in understanding biological vision relies on the comparison of computational models with brain data with the goal of capturing functional principles of visual information processing. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have successfully matched the transformations in hierarchical processing occurring along the brains feedforward visual pathway extending into ventral temporal cortex. However, we are still to learn if CNNs can successfully describe feedback processes in early visual cortex. Here, we investigated similarities between human early visual cortex and a CNN with encoder/decoder architecture, trained with self-supervised learning to fill occlusions and reconstruct an unseen image. Using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA), we compared 3T fMRI data from a non-stimulated patch of early visual cortex in human participants viewing partially occluded images, with the different CNN layer activations from the same images. Results show that our self-supervised image-completion network outperforms a classical object-recognition supervised network (VGG16) in terms of similarity to fMRI data. This provides additional evidence that optimal models of the visual system might come from less feedforward architectures trained with less supervision. We also find that CNN decoder pathway activations are more similar to brain processing compared to encoder activations, suggesting an integration of mid- and low/middle-level features in early visual cortex. Challenging an AI model and the human brain to solve the same task offers a valuable way to compare CNNs with brain data and helps to constrain our understanding of information processing such as neuronal predictive coding.",

    "abstract": "The amount of habitat in a landscape is an important metric for evaluating the effects of land cover and land use on biodiversity and ecosystem services, yet it fails to capture complex temporal dimensions of resource availability that could be consequential for species population dynamics. If ephemeral resources across multiple habitat patches are synchronously available, resource gaps could be detrimental to population growth. In contrast, asynchronously available resources create a mosaic of temporally complementary resources that mobile organisms can track across the landscape. Knowledge is especially lacking on the relevance of temporal complementation for tri-trophic interactions and biological pest control. Here we use a spatially-explicit predator-prey metapopulation model to test the effect of different spatiotemporal resource patterns on insect predators and their prey. We examined prey and predator responses in model landscapes that varied in both the amount and temporal variability of basal vegetation resources. Further, we examined cases where prey comprised either a single generalist species or two specialist species that use different resources available either early or late in the growing season. We found that predators and generalist prey benefitted from lower temporal variance of basal resources, which increased both of their landscape-scale abundances. However, increasing the amount of basal resources also increased the variability of generalist prey populations, resulting in a negative correlation between basal resource amount and predator abundance. Specialist prey, on the other hand, did not benefit from less temporally variable in basal resources, since they were restricted by habitat type while also suffering greater predation. Predators feeding on specialists achieved greater prey suppression in landscapes with less temporally variable resources. Our simulations demonstrate the joint importance of landscape-scale temporal dynamics of resources and resource amount in understanding how landscape heterogeneity influences biodiversity and ecosystem services such as the biological control of agricultural pests.",

    "abstract": "The role of the spatial juxtaposition between activating and inhibitory receptors in cytotoxic lymphocytes has been strongly debated in the context of the inhibition of immune signaling. The challenge in addressing this problem was so far a lack of experimental tools which can simultaneously manipulate different signaling molecules. Here, we circumvent this challenge by introducing a nanoengineered multifunctional cell niche, in which activating and inhibitory ligands are positioned with molecular-scale variability and control, and applied it to elucidate the role of the spatial juxtaposition between ligands for NKG2D and KIR2DL1 - activating and inhibitory receptors in Natural Killer (NK) cells - in KIR2DL1-mediated inhibition of NKG2D signaling. We realized the niche by a nanopatterning of nanodots of different metals with molecular scale registry in one lithographic step, followed by a novel ternary functionalization of the fabricated bi-metallic pattern and its background to with three distinct biochemical moieties. We found, that within the probed range, the 40 nm gap between the activating and inhibitory ligands provided an optimal inhibition condition. Supported by theoretical modeling and simulations we interpret these findings as a consequence of the size and conformational flexibility of the ligands in their spatial interaction. Our findings provide an important insight onto the spatial mechanism of the inhibitory immune checkpoints, whose understanding is both fundamentally important, and essential for the rational design of future immunotherapies. Furthermore, our approach is highly versatile and paves the way to numerous complex molecular platforms aimed at revealing molecular mechanisms through which receptors integrate their signals.",

In this study, we focus on neurogliaform cells, a specialized form of neuron that possess physiological features enabling them to impart a widespread inhibitory influence on neural activity. We demonstrate that this prominent neuronal subtype, embedded in both mouse and human neural circuits, undergo remarkably similar activity-dependent modulation manifesting as epochs of enhanced intrinsic excitability.

We found that fsd1 knockout mutants exhibit reduced lateral root number and that this phenotype was complemented by proFSD1::GFP:FSD1 and proFSD1::FSD1:GFP constructs. Light sheet fluorescence microscopy revealed a temporary accumulation of FSD1-GFP at the site of endosperm rupture during seed germination. In emerged roots, FSD1-GFP showed the highest abundance in cells of the lateral root cap, columella, and endodermis/cortex initials. The largest subcellular pool of FSD1-GFP was localized in the plastid stroma, while it was also located in the nuclei and cytoplasm. FSD1 is crucial for seed germination and salt stress tolerance, which is tightly coupled with FSD1-GFP subcellular relocation to the plasma membrane. FSD1 is most likely involved in superoxide decomposition in the periplasm. This study suggests a new osmoprotective function of SODs in plants.",

Using both visual observation and pan-trapping we characterized the community of arthropods that visited S. nigra flowers and assessed the differences among male and female trees as well as the chemical and visual drivers that influenced community composition across three years. We found that male trees consistently supported higher diversity of insects than female trees and only three insect species, all Andrena spp., consistently visited both sexes. Additionally, A. nigrae, which was the only insect that occurred more on female than male flowers, correlated strongly to volatile cues. This suggests that cross-pollinators cue into specific aspects of floral scent, but diversity of floral visitors is driven strongly by visual cues. Through time the floral activity of two Andrena species remained stable, but A. nigrae visited less in 2017 when flowers bloomed earlier than other years. When native bee emergence does not synchronize with bloom, activity appears to be greatly diminished which could threaten species that only subsist on a single host. Despite the community diversity of S. nigra flowers, its productivity depends on a small fraction of species that are not threatened by competition, but rather rapidly changing conditions that lead to host-insect asynchrony.",

    "abstract": "The Holocene arrival of humans on Madagascar precipitated major changes to the islands biodiversity. The now-extinct, endemic \"subfossil\" megafauna of Madagascar were likely hunted by the islands early human inhabitants. Perhaps in part due to preferential hunting of larger prey, no surviving species on Madagascar is larger than 10 kg. Outside of Madagascar, size-selective hunting pressure has resulted in the phyletic dwarfism of many still-living species across a diversity of phyla. On Madagascar, some subfossil bones of extant lemurs are considerably larger than those of the modern members of their species, but relatively large distances between the subfossil localities and modern samples that have been compared to date makes it impossible to reject the possibility that these size differences more simply reflect pre-existing ecogeographic variation. Here, we used high-resolution 3D scan data to conduct comparative morphological analyses of subfossil and modern skeletal remains of one of the larger extant lemurs, Verreauxs sifakas (Propithecus verreauxi) from subfossil and modern sites [~]10 km adjacent: Taolambiby (bones dated to 725-560 - 1075-955 cal. years before present) and Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve, respectively. We found that the average subfossil sifaka bone (n=12) is 9% and significantly larger than that of modern sifakas (n=31 individuals; permutation test; p=0.037). When restricting the analysis to the single element and side with the largest representation in the subfossil sample (n=4 right distal femora), the average subfossil bone is 10% larger (p=0.046). While we cannot yet conclude whether this size difference reflects evolutionary change or an archaeological aggregation/taphonomic process, if this is a case of phyletic dwarfism in response to human size-selective harvesting pressures then the estimated rate of evolutionary change is slightly higher than that previously calculated for other archaeological cases of this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Many of the effects on fitness in population genetics are due not to single locations in the genome, but to the interaction of genetic variants at multiple locations in the genome. Of particular interest are  completely epistatic interactions, where a combination of genetic variants is required to produce an effect, and the effect cannot occur with any other combination. In diploids, epistasis is strongly connected to meiotic recombination, a process which can both assemble and destroy beneficial combinations of genetic variants. Additionally, epistatic interactions can be hard to detect in empirical studies, and mathematical models of epistasis and recombination are challenging to analyse, so despite their ubiquity epistatic interactions are regularly not considered. As a result, there is little consensus on when high levels of recombination might be expected, or how strongly recombination affects beneficial or deleterious fitness effects controlled by epistatic interactions. We address this question by conducting a meta-analysis and simulations. The meta-analysis used data drawn and curated from Drosophila melanogaster studies in Flybase. We extracted studies relating genetic combinations and phenotypically detectable effects on fitness, then analysed the relationship between the rate of recombination and effect on fitness with a statistical model. We also ran simulations under a two-locus Wright-Fisher model with recombination and epistatic selection. The results of both approaches indicated a tendency for genetic combinations with an epistatic effect on fitness to occur in an environment of reduced meiotic recombination. Two possible explanations for this are that the variants controlling such interactions are selected for in regions where there is little recombination, or that such interactions lead to selection for lower rates of recombination in the regions where those variants appear.",

    "abstract": "Isolation by distance is a widespread pattern in nature that describes the reduction of genetic correlation between subpopulations with increased geographic distance. In the population ancestral to modern sister species, this pattern may hypothetically inflate population divergence time estimation due to the potential for allele frequency differences in subpopulations at the ends of the ancestral population. In this study, we analyze the relationship between the time to the most recent common ancestor and the population divergence time when the ancestral population model is a linear stepping-stone. Using coalescent simulations, we compare the coalescent time to the population divergence time for various ratios of the divergence time over the product of the population size and the deme number. Next, we simulate whole genomes to obtain SNPs, and use the Bayesian coalescent program SNAPP to estimate divergence times. We find that as the rate of migration between neighboring demes decreases, the coalescent time becomes significantly greater than the population divergence time when sampled from end demes. Divergence-time overestimation in SNAPP becomes severe when the divergence-to-population size ratio < 10 and migration is low. We conclude that studies estimating divergence times be cognizant of the potential ancestral population structure in an explicitly spatial context or risk dramatically overestimating the timing of population splits.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of resistance to azithromycin complicates treatment of N. gonorrhoeae, the etiologic agent of gonorrhea. Population genomic analyses of clinical isolates have demonstrated that some azithromycin resistance remains unexplained after accounting for the contributions of known resistance mutations in the 23S rRNA and the MtrCDE efflux pump. Bacterial genome-wide association studies (GWAS) offer a promising approach for identifying novel resistance genes but must adequately address the challenge of controlling for genetic confounders while maintaining power to detect variants with lower effect sizes. Compared to a standard univariate GWAS, conducting GWAS conditioned on known resistance mutations with high effect sizes substantially reduced the number of variants that reached genome-wide significance and identified a G70D mutation in the 50S ribosomal protein L4 (encoded by the gene rplD) as significantly associated with increased azithromycin minimum inhibitory concentrations ({beta} = 1.03, 95% CI [0.76, 1.30]). The role and prevalence of these rplD mutations in conferring macrolide resistance in N. gonorrhoeae had been unclear. Here, we experimentally confirmed our GWAS results, identified other resistance-associated mutations in RplD, and showed that in total these RplD binding site mutations are prevalent (present in 5.42% of 4850 isolates) and geographically and temporally widespread (identified in 21/65 countries across two decades). Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of conditional associations for improving the performance of microbial GWAS and advance our understanding of the genetic basis of macrolide resistance in a prevalent multidrug-resistant pathogen.",

By contrast, adhesion and biofilm formation, which are potentially involved in gut colonization, microbiota structure and stability, have hardly been investigated in this intestinal bacterium. To uncover B. thetaiotaomicron biofilm-related functions, we performed a transposon mutagenesis in the poor biofilm-forming reference strain VPI 5482 and showed that capsule 4, one of the eight B. thetaiotaomicron capsules, hinders biofilm formation. We then showed that the production of capsules 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 also inhibits biofilm formation and that decreased capsulation of the population correlated with increased biofilm formation, suggesting that capsules could be masking adhesive surface structures. We also showed that, by contrast, capsule 8 displayed intrinsic adhesive properties. Finally, we demonstrated that BT2934, the wzx homolog of B. thetaiotaomicron glycosylation locus, competes with capsule production and therefore impacts its adhesion capacity. This study identified regulation of capsular polysaccharides as a major determinant of B. thetaiotaomicron biofilm formation, providing new insights into how modulation of different B. thetaiotaomicron surface structures affect in vitro biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "Stochastic pulsatile dynamics have been observed in an increasing number of biological circuits with typical mechanism involving feedback control. Surprisingly, recent single-cell experiments showed that E. coli flagellar class-2&3 promoters are activated in stochastic pulses without the means of feedback, however, the underlying design principles of pulse generation have remained unclear. Here, by developing a system-level stochastic model constrained by a large set of E. coli flagellar synthesis data from different strains and mutants, we identify the underlying design principles for generating stochastic transcriptional pulses without feedback. Our model shows that YdiV, an inhibitor of the class-1 master regulator (FlhDC), creates an ultrasensitve switch that serves as a digital filter to eliminate small amplitude FlhDC fluctuations. Additionally, we demonstrate that fast temporal fluctuations of FlhDC are smoothed out and integrated over time before affecting class-2 downstream genes. Together, our results reveal the existence of a filter-and-integrate design that is necessary for generating stochastic pulses without feedback. This strategy suggests that E. coli may avoid premature activation of the expensive flagellar gene expression by filtering input fluctuations in intensity and in time.",

    "abstract": "The anaerobic gut fungi (AGF, Neocallimastigomycota) reside in the alimentary tracts of herbivores where they play a central role in the breakdown of ingested plant material. Accurate assessment of AGF diversity has been hampered by inherent deficiencies of the internal transcribed spacer1 (ITS1) region as a phylogenetic marker. Here, we report on the development and implementation of the D1/D2 region of the large ribosomal subunit (D1/D2 LSU) as a novel marker for assessing AGF diversity in culture-independent surveys. Sequencing a 1.4-1.5 Kbp amplicon encompassing the ITS1-5.8S rRNA-ITS2-D1/D2 LSU region in the ribosomal RNA locus from fungal strains and environmental samples generated a reference D1/D2 LSU database for all cultured AGF genera, as well as the majority of candidate genera encountered in prior ITS1-based diversity surveys. Subsequently, a D1/D2 LSU-based diversity survey using long read PacBio SMRT sequencing technology was conducted on fecal samples from 21 wild and domesticated herbivores. Twenty-eight genera and candidate genera were identified in the 17.7 K sequences obtained, including multiple novel lineages that were predominantly, but not exclusively, identified in wild herbivores. Association between certain AGF genera and animal lifestyles, or animal host family was observed. Finally, to address the current paucity of AGF isolates, concurrent isolation efforts utilizing multiple approaches to maximize recovery yielded 216 isolates belonging to twelve different genera, several of which have no prior cultured-representatives. Our results establish the utility of D1/D2 LSU and PacBio sequencing for AGF diversity surveys, and the culturability of a wide range of AGF taxa, and demonstrate that wild herbivores represent a yet-untapped reservoir of AGF diversity.",

Embecovirus particles are studded with two types of surface projections called S (for spike) and HE (for haemagglutinin-esterase), with S mediating receptor-binding and membrane fusion and HE acting as a receptor-destroying enzyme. Together, they promote dynamic virion attachment to glycan-based receptors with 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as main constituent. We recently showed that adaptation of HKU1 and OC43 to replication in the human respiratory tract involved loss-of-function mutations in the lectin domain of HE. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of the [~]80 kDa, heavily glycosylated HKU1 HE at a global resolution of 3.4 [A]. Comparison to existing HE structures reveals a drastically truncated lectin domain, incompatible with sialic acid binding, but with the structure and function of the HE esterase domain left intact. Our cryo-EM structure, in combination with mass spectrometry analysis, also describes the extent of glycosylation on the now redundant lectin domain, which forms a putative glycan shield. The findings further our insight into the evolution and host adaptation of human embecoviruses and also demonstrate the utility of cryo-EM for studying small, heavily glycosylated proteins which are intractable to X-ray crystallography.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA major bottleneck in the use of metagenome sequencing for human gut microbiome studies has been the lack of a comprehensive genome collection to be used as a reference database. Several recent efforts have been made to re-construct genomes from human gut metagenome data, resulting in a huge increase in the number of relevant genomes. In this work, we aimed to create a collection of the most prevalent healthy human gut prokaryotic genomes, to be used as a reference database, including both MAGs from the human gut and ordinary RefSeq genomes.\n\nResultsWe screened > 5,700 healthy human gut metagenomes for the containment of > 490,000 publicly available prokaryotic genomes sourced from RefSeq and the recently announced UHGG collection. This resulted in a pool of > 379,000 genomes that were subsequently scored and ranked based on their prevalence in the healthy human metagenomes. The genomes were then clustered at subspecies resolution, and cluster representatives were retained to comprise the HumGut collection. Using the Kraken2 software for classification, we find superior performance in the assignment of metagenomic reads, classifying on average 94.5% of the reads in a metagenome, as opposed to 86% with UHGG and 44% when using standard Kraken2 database. HumGut, half the size of standard Kraken2 database and directly comparable to the UHGG size, outperforms them both.\n\nConclusionsThe HumGut collection contains > 30,000 genomes clustered at subspecies resolution and ranked by human gut prevalence. We demonstrate how metagenomes from IBD-patients map equally well to this collection, indicating this reference is relevant also for studies well outside the metagenome reference set used to obtain HumGut. We believe this is a valuable resource in a field in dire need of method standardization. All data and metadata, as well as helpful code, are available at http://arken.nmbu.no/~larssn/humgut/.",

The mode of miR-124 as a positive regulator is determined by a neuron-enriched RNA-binding protein, ELAVL3, that interacts with AGO and binds target transcripts, whereas the non-neuronal ELAVL1 counterpart fails to elevate the miRNA-target gene expression. Although existing literature indicate that miRNA-ELAVL1 interaction can result in either target gene upregulation or downregulation in a context-dependent manner, we specifically identified neuronal ELAVL3 as the driver for miRNA target gene upregulation in neurons. In primary human neurons, repressing miR-124 and ELAVL3 led to the downregulation of genes involved in neuronal function and process outgrowth, and cellular phenotypes of reduced inward currents and neurite outgrowth.

Grunts from members were more similar within than across social levels (N = 351 dyads for comparison within and between gangs, and N = 169 dyads within and between parties), but the effect sizes were small. Yet, acoustic similarity did not correlate with genetic relatedness, suggesting that higher amounts of social interactions rather than genetic relatedness promote the observed vocal convergence. We consider this convergence a result of sensory-motor integration and suggest this to be an implicit form of vocal learning shared with humans, in contrast to the goal-directed and intentional explicit form of vocal learning unique to human speech acquisition.",

    "abstract": "Since observations that CRISPR nucleases function in mammalian cells, many strategies have been devised to adapt them for genetic engineering. Here, we investigated self-cutting and integrating CRISPR-Cas9 plasmids (SCIPs) as easy-to-use gene editing tools that insert themselves at CRISPR-guided locations. SCIPs demonstrated similar expression kinetics and gene disruption efficiency in mouse (EL4) and human (Jurkat) cells, with stable integration in 3-6% of transfected cells. Clonal sequencing analysis indicated that integrants showed bi- or mono-allelic integration of entire CRISPR plasmids in predictable orientations and with limited indel formation. Interestingly, including longer homology arms (HAs) (500 bp) in varying orientations only modestly increased knock-in efficiency ([~]2-fold). Using a SCIP-payload design (SCIPpay) which liberates a promoter-less sequence flanked by HAs thereby requiring perfect homology-directed repair (HDR) for transgene expression, longer HAs resulted in higher integration efficiency and precision of the payload but did not affect integration of the remaining plasmid sequence. As proofs-of-concept, we used SCIPpay to 1) insert a gene fragment encoding tdTomato into the CD69 locus of Jurkat cells, thereby creating a cell line that reports T cell activation, and 2) insert a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) gene into the TRAC locus. Here, we demonstrate that SCIPs function as simple, efficient, and programmable tools useful for generating gene knock-out/knock-in cell lines and suggest future utility in knock-in site screening/optimization, unbiased off-target site identification, and multiplexed, iterative, and/or library-scale automated genome engineering.",

MHCII surface levels and life span are regulated post-translationally by peptide loading and ubiquitin-dependent lysosomal targeting, but proteases responsible for MHCII protein degradation remain unidentified. Here, we examined the role of aspartyl proteases in MHCII protein degradation and characterised the form of MHCII that is degraded. Exposure of immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MoDCs) and KG-1 acute myeloid leukaemia cells to the aspartyl protease inhibitor, pepstatin A (PepA), caused accumulation of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR molecules in intracellular vesicles. Statistically significant PepA effects on MHCII protein expression were also observed in murine APCs. In KG-1 cells, cathepsin D (CatD) was the sole expressed aspartyl protease, and shRNA-mediated knockdown ablated the PepA effect, providing formal proof of CatD involvement. In vitro, CatD initiated specific cleavage of recombinant DR at F54, a site flanking the peptide-binding groove. Immunochemical characteristics of PepA-rescued DR molecules in KG-1 cells were consistent with selective CatD attack on HLA-DR molecules that lack association with the MHCII chaperone, invariant chain, or with stably bound peptide. We propose that CatD has a critical role in the selective lysosomal disposal of mature HLA-DR molecules that have lost, or never acquired, bound peptide, explaining how MHCII protein life span is coupled to peptide loading.",

Because it plays prominent roles in cancer, Bcl-xL is a major target for anti-cancer therapy and for studies aimed at understanding its structure and activity. While Bcl-xL is active primarily at intracellular membranes, most studies have focused on soluble forms of the protein lacking both the membrane-anchoring C-terminal tail and the intrinsically disordered loop, and this has resulted in a fragmented view of the proteins biological activity. Here we describe how these segments affect the proteins conformation and ligand binding activity in both its soluble and membrane-anchored states. The combined data from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) provide information about the molecular basis for the proteins functionality and a view of its complex molecular mechanisms.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe human protein Bcl-xL is a key regulator of programmed cell death in health and disease. Structural studies, important for understating the molecular basis for its functions, have advanced primarily by deleting both the long disordered loop that regulates its activity and the C-terminal tail that anchors the protein to intracellular membranes Here we describe the preparation and conformations of full-length Bcl-xL in both its water-soluble and membrane-anchored states.

    "abstract": "The size and shape of organs is tightly controlled to achieve optimal function. Natural morphological variations often represent functional adaptations to an ever-changing environment. For instance, variation in head morphology is pervasive in insects and the underlying molecular basis is starting to be revealed in the Drosophila genus for species of the melanogaster group. However, it remains unclear whether similar diversifications are governed by similar or different molecular mechanisms over longer timescales. To address this issue, we used species of the virilis phylad because they have been diverging from D. melanogaster for at least 40 million years. Our comprehensive morphological survey revealed remarkable differences in eye size and head shape among these species with D. novamexicana having the smallest eyes and southern D. americana populations having the largest eyes. We show that the genetic architecture underlying eye size variation is complex with multiple associated genetic variants located on most chromosomes. Our genome wide association study (GWAS) strongly suggests that some of the putative causative variants are associated with the presence of inversions. Indeed, northern populations of D. americana share derived inversions with D. novamexicana and they show smaller eyes compared to southern ones. Intriguingly, we observed a significant enrichment of genes involved in eye development on the 4th chromosome after intersecting chromosomal regions associated with phenotypic differences with those showing high differentiation among D. americana populations. We propose that variants associated with chromosomal inversions contribute to both intra- and inter-specific variation in eye size among species of the virilis phylad.",

    "abstract": "Immunosuppression of unknown etiology is a hallmark feature of glioblastoma (GBM) and is characterized by decreased CD4 T cell counts and down regulation of MHC class II expression on peripheral blood monocytes in patients. This immunosuppression is a critical barrier to the successful development of immunotherapies for GBM. We recapitulated the immunosuppression observed in GBM patients in the C57BL/6 mouse and investigated the etiology of low CD4 T cell counts. We determined that thymic involution was a hallmark feature of immunosuppression in three distinct models of CNS cancer, including mice harboring GL261 glioma, B16 melanoma, and in a spontaneous model of Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG). In addition to thymic involution, we determined that tumor growth in the brain induced significant splenic involution, reductions in peripheral T cells, reduced MHC class II expression on hematopoietic cells, and a modest increase in bone marrow resident CD4 T cells with a naive phenotype. Using parabiosis we report that thymic involution, declines in peripheral T cell counts, and reduced MHC class II expression levels were mediated through circulating blood-derived factors. Conversely, T cell sequestration in the bone marrow was not governed through circulating factors. Serum isolated from glioma-bearing mice potently inhibited proliferation and functions of T cells both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, the factor responsible for immunosuppression in serum is nonsteroidal and of high molecular weight. Through further analysis of neurological disease models, we determined that the aforementioned immunosuppression was not unique to cancer itself, but rather occurs in response to CNS injury. Noncancerous acute neurological insults also induced significant thymic involution and rendered serum immunosuppressive. Both thymic involution and serum-derived immunosuppression were reversible upon clearance of brain insults. These findings demonstrate that CNS cancers cause multifaceted immunosuppression and pinpoint circulating factors as a target of intervention to restore immunity.\n\nShort SummaryCNS cancers and other brain-injuries suppress immunity through release of non-steroid soluble factors that disrupt immune homeostasis and dampen responses of the peripheral immune system.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/006825v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14e90c2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@101de5corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ad8534org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1041fef_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract\n\nC_FIG",

Here, we describe the development of a coronavirus antigen microarray containing immunologically significant antigens from SARS-CoV-2, in addition to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, common human coronavirus strains, and other common respiratory viruses. A preliminary study of human sera collected prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic demonstrates overall high IgG reactivity to common human coronaviruses and low IgG reactivity to epidemic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, with some cross-reactivity of conserved antigenic domains including S2 domain of spike protein and nucleocapsid protein. This array can be used to answer outstanding questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection, including whether baseline serology for other coronaviruses impacts disease course, how the antibody response to infection develops over time, and what antigens would be optimal for vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "A key unknown of the functional space in tumor immunity is whether physiologically relevant cancer antigen presentation occurs solely in draining lymph nodes versus tumors. Professional antigen presenting cells, i.e. the dendritic cells, are scarce and immature within tumors, greatly outnumbered by MHCII expressing non-hematopoietic cells, such as antigen-presenting cancer-associated fibroblasts (apCAFs). We hypothesized that after their exit from tumor-draining lymph nodes T cells depend on a second wave of antigen presentation provided in situ by structural cells. We show that dense apCAF regions in human lung tumors define hot immunological spots with increased numbers of CD4 T cells. The transcriptomic profile of human lung apCAFs aligned to that of pancreatic apCAFs across mice and humans and were both enriched for alveolar type II genes, suggesting an epithelial origin. Mechanistically, human apCAFs directly activated the TCRs of adjacent effector CD4 T cells and at the same time produced high levels of c1q, which acted on surface c1qbp on T cells to rescue them from apoptosis. Fibroblast-specific deletion of MHCII in mice impaired local MHCII immunity and accelerated tumor growth, while inducing c1qbp overexpression in adoptively transferred T cells expanded their numbers within tumors and reduced tumour burden. Collectively, our work shows that tumor T cell immunity post lymph node exit requires peripheral antigen presentation by a subset of CAFs and proposes a new conceptual framework upon which effective cancer immunotherapies can be built.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPathogenic microorganisms cause disease by invading, colonizing and damaging their host. Virulence factors including bacterial toxins contribute to their pathogenicity. Additionally, antimicrobial resistance genes allow pathogens to evade otherwise curative treatments. To understand causal relationships between microbiome compositions, functioning, and disease, it is therefore essential to identify virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance genes in metagenomic datasets. At present, there is a clear lack of computational approaches to simultaneously identifying these factors. Here we present PathoFact, a tool for the contextualized prediction of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance genes in metagenomic data.\n\nResultsPathoFact predicts virulence factors, bacterial toxins and antimicrobial resistance genes with high accuracy (0.92, 0.83 and 0.99) and specificity (0.96, 0.99 and 0.98), respectively. The performance of PathoFact was furthermore demonstrated on three publicly available case-control metagenomic datasets representing an actual infection as well as chronic diseases in which either pathogenic potential or bacterial toxins were predicted to play a role. With PathoFact, we identified virulence factors (including toxins) and antimicrobial resistance genes, and identified signature genes which differentiated between the disease and control groups.\n\nConclusionPathoFact is an easy-to-use, modular, and reproducible pipeline for the identification of virulence factors, toxins and antimicrobial resistance genes in metagenomic data. Additionally, PathoFact combines the prediction of these pathogenicity factors with the identification of mobile genetic elements. This provides further depth to the analysis by considering the genomic context of the pertinent genes. Furthermore, each module (virulence factors, toxin and antimicrobial resistance genes) of PathoFact is also a standalone component, making it a flexible and versatile tool.

    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is protected by a cell envelope that is crucial for viability. In addition to peptidoglycan, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is an especially important component of the S. aureus cell envelope. LTA is an anionic polymer anchored to a glycolipid in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane. It was known that deleting the gene for UgtP, the enzyme that makes this glycolipid anchor, causes cell growth and division defects. In Bacillus subtilis, growth abnormalities from the loss of ugtP have been attributed to the absence of the encoded protein, not to loss of its enzymatic activity. Here, we show that growth defects in S. aureus ugtP deletion mutants are due to the long, abnormal LTA polymer that is produced when the glycolipid anchor is missing from the outer leaflet of the membrane. Dysregulated cell growth leads to defective cell division, and these phenotypes are corrected by mutations in the LTA polymerase, ltaS, that reduce polymer length. We also show that S. aureus mutants with long LTA are sensitized to cell wall hydrolases, beta-lactam antibiotics, and compounds that target other cell envelope pathways. We conclude that control of LTA polymer length is important for S. aureus physiology and promotes survival under stressful conditions, including antibiotic stress.\n\nIMPORTANCEMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a common cause of community- and hospital-acquired infections and is responsible for a large fraction of deaths caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. S. aureus is surrounded by a complex cell envelope that protects it from antimicrobial compounds and other stresses. Here we show that controlling the length of an essential cell envelope polymer, lipoteichoic acid, is critical for controlling S. aureus cell size and cell envelope integrity. We also show that genes involved in LTA length regulation are required for resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in MRSA. The proteins encoded by these genes may be targets for combination therapy with an appropriate beta-lactam.",

    "abstract": "Hook-length control is a central checkpoint during assembly of the bacterial flagellum. During hook growth, a 405 amino acids (aa) protein, FliK, is intermittently secreted and thought to function as a molecular measuring tape that, in Salmonella, controls hook-length to 55 nm {+/-} 6 nm. The underlying mechanism involves interactions of both the -helical, N-terminal domain of FliK (FliKN) with the hook and hook cap, and of its C-terminal domain with a component of the export apparatus. However, various deletion mutants of FliKN display uncontrolled hook-length, which is not consistent with a ruler mechanism. Here, we carried out an extensive deletion analysis of FliKN to investigate its contribution in the hook-length control mechanism. We identified FliKN mutants deleted for up to 80 aa that retained wildtype motility. However, the short FliK variants did not produce shorter hook-lengths as expected from a physical ruler. Rather, the minimal length of the hook depends on the level of hook protein production and secretion. Our results thus support a model in which FliK functions as a hook growth terminator protein that limits the maximal length of the hook, and not as a molecular ruler that physically measures hook-length.",

    "abstract": "Global marine sediments harbor a large and highly diverse microbial biosphere, but the mechanism by which this biosphere is established during sediment burial is largely unknown. During burial in marine sediments, concentrations of easily-metabolized organic compounds and total microbial cell abundance decrease steadily. However, it is unknown whether some microbial clades increase with depth, despite the overall trend of abundance decrease. We show total population increases in 38 microbial families over 3 cm of sediment depth in the upper 7.5 cm of White Oak River (WOR) estuary sediments. Clades that increased with depth were more often anaerobic, uncultured, or common in deep marine sediments relative to those that decreased. Minimum turnover times (which are minimum in situ doubling times of growth rates) were estimated to be 2-25 years by combining sedimentation rate with either quantitative PCR (qPCR) or the product of the Fraction Read Abundance of 16S rRNA genes and total Cell counts (FRAxC). Turnover times were within an order of magnitude of each other in two adjacent cores, as well as in two laboratory enrichments of Cape Lookout Bight (CLB), NC, sediments (average difference of 28 {+/-} 19%). qPCR and FRAxC in WOR cores and FRAxC in CLB incubations produced similar turnover times for key deep subsurface uncultured clades Bathyarchaeota (8.7 {+/-} 1.9 years) and Thermoprofundales/MBG-D (4.1 {+/-} 0.7 years). We conclude that common deep subsurface microbial clades experience a narrow zone of growth in shallow sediments, offering an opportunity for natural selection of traits for long-term subsistence after resuspension events.\n\nSignificance statementThe current dogma is that the deeply-branching uncultured microbes that dominate global marine sediments do not actually increase in population size as they are buried in marine sediments - rather they exist in a sort of prolonged torpor for thousands of years. This is because no evidence has ever been found that these clades actually increase population sizes, or grow, as they are gradually buried. We discovered that they actually do increase population sizes during burial, but only in the upper few centimeters. This changes our dogma about marine sediments as a vast repository of non-growing microbes, to a vast repository of non-growing microbes with a thin and relatively rapid area of growth in the upper 10 centimeters.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplasts originate from endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium within a heterotrophic host cell. Establishing endosymbiosis requires the translocation across its envelope of photosynthetic products generated inside the once free-living cyanobacterium to be exploited by host metabolism. However, the nature of this translocation event is unknown. We previously found that most cyanobacterial outer membrane components were eliminated during the primitive stage of chloroplast evolution, suggesting the importance of evolutionary changes of the outer membrane. Here, we removed the outer membrane from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 by disrupting the physical interaction with peptidoglycan, and characterized the effects on cell function. Outer membrane-deprived cells liberated diverse substances into the environment without significantly compromising photoautotrophic growth. The amount of liberated proteins increased to ~0.35 g/L within five days of culture. Proteomic analysis showed that most liberated proteins were periplasmic and thylakoid luminal components. Connectivity between the thylakoid lumen-extracellular space was confirmed by findings that an exogenous hydrophilic oxidant was reduced by photosynthetic electron transport chain on the thylakoid membrane. Metabolomic analysis detected the release of nucleotide-related metabolites at concentrations around 1 M. The liberated materials supported the proliferation of heterotrophic bacteria. These findings show that breaching the outer membrane, without any manipulations to the cytoplasmic membrane, converts a cyanobacterium to a chloroplast-like organism that conducts photosynthesis and releases its biogenic materials. This conversion not only represents a potential explanation why the outer membrane markedly changed during the earliest stage of chloroplast evolution, but also provides the opportunity to harness cyanobacterial photosynthesis for biomanufacturing processes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTAlthough it is well accepted that chloroplasts stem from endosymbiosis of a cyanobacterium within a heterotrophic host cell, the issue of how photosynthetic products generated inside a formerly free-living cyanobacterium are translocated across its envelope and exploited by host metabolism has been little addressed. Here we show that breaching the cyanobacterial outer membrane barrier converts a cyanobacterium to a chloroplast-like organism that conducts photosynthesis and releases its diverse biogenic materials into its external environment, which sustains the growth of heterotrophic organisms. This conversion represents a possible example of metabolic exploitation of cyanobacterial photosynthesis. Further, this \"quasi-chloroplast\" provides a potential opportunity for industrial application such as producing feedstock for biomanufacturing processes that harnesses heterotrophic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "The HIV-1 accessory protein Vpr is packaged into new virions at a 7:1 ratio of Gag/Vpr. Previous biochemical and genetic analysis has shown that Vpr gets packaged into virions via an LXXLF motif on the p6 domain of the Gag structural polyprotein. The kinetics of Vpr packaging compared to Gag assembly was previously unknown. Here, we confirm via biochemistry and imaging that fluorescently tagged Vpr gets packaged into virus-like particles only when the LXXLF motif is intact. When the LXXLF motif is mutated, Vpr is no longer recruited to Gag assemblies. When Vpr and Gag assembly are imaged together, we see that Vpr co-assembles with a slight delay compared to Gag suggesting that Vpr is not being recruited to the membrane with Gag but is instead being recruited to actively assembling Gag.\n\nImportanceHIV-1 affects over 30 million people around the globe, and although we have good treatments, there is still no cure. The virus encodes 15 distinct proteins, and four of those proteins are known as accessory proteins. Vpr is one of the accessory proteins that is packaged into HIV-1 by interacting with the Gag structural protein. Without Vpr, HIV-1 is not as infectious. Our research shows that Vpr is packaged into new viruses as the virus is being formed rather than being put in towards the end of the assembly of a virus. Getting a clearer view of each step in the process of assembling each virion will help inform future treatments and help with overall comparisons between the assembly of different viruses.",

    "abstract": "Combining two-photon calcium imaging (2PCI) and electron microscopy (EM) provides arguably the most powerful current approach for connecting function to structure in neural circuits. Recent years have seen dramatic advances in obtaining and processing CI and EM data separately. In addition, several joint CI-EM datasets (with CI performed in vivo, followed by EM reconstruction of the same volume) have been collected. However, no automated analysis tools yet exist that can match each signal extracted from the CI data to a cell segment extracted from EM; previous efforts have been largely manual and focused on analyzing calcium activity in cell bodies, neglecting potentially rich functional information from axons and dendrites. There are two major roadblocks to solving this matching problem: first, dense EM reconstruction extracts orders of magnitude more segments than are visible in the corresponding CI field of view, and second, due to optical constraints and non-uniform brightness of the calcium indicator in each cell, direct matching of EM and CI spatial components is nontrivial.\n\nIn this work we develop a pipeline for fusing CI and densely-reconstructed EM data. We model the observed CI data using a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (CNMF) framework, in which segments extracted from the EM reconstruction serve to initialize and constrain the spatial components of the matrix factorization. We develop an efficient iterative procedure for solving the resulting combined matching and matrix factorization problem and apply this procedure to joint CI-EM data from mouse visual cortex. The method recovers hundreds of dendritic components from the CI data, visible across multiple functional scans at different depths, matched with densely-reconstructed three-dimensional neural segments recovered from the EM volume. We publicly release the output of this analysis as a new gold standard dataset that can be used to score algorithms for demixing signals from 2PCI data. Finally, we show that this database can be exploited to (1) learn a mapping from 3d EM segmentations to predict the corresponding 2d spatial components estimated from CI data, and (2) train a neural network to denoise these estimated spatial components. This neural network denoiser is a stand-alone module that can be dropped in to enhance any existing 2PCI analysis pipeline.",

Here, we employ organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) that are micropatterned into linear arrays to obtain precise optogenetic control in Drosophila melanogaster larvae expressing the light-gated activator CsChrimson and the inhibitor GtACR2 within their peripheral sensory system. Our method allows confinement of light stimuli to within individual abdominal segments, which facilitates the study of larval behaviour in response to local sensory input. We show controlled triggering of specific crawling modes and find that targeted neurostimulation in abdominal segments switches the direction of crawling. More broadly, our work demonstrates how OLEDs can provide tailored patterns of light for photo-stimulation of neuronal networks, with future implications ranging from mapping neuronal connectivity in cultures to targeted photo-stimulation with pixelated OLED implants in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Sensory perception is a product of complex interactions between the internal state of an organism and the physical attributes of a stimulus. One factor that modulates the internal state of the perceiving agent is voluntary movement. It has been shown across the animal kingdom that perception and sensory-evoked physiological responses are modulated depending on whether or not the stimulus is the consequence of voluntary actions. These phenomena are often attributed to motor signals sent to relevant sensory regions (efference copies), that convey information about expected upcoming sensory consequences. However, to date, there is no direct evidence in humans for efferent signals underlying these motor-sensory interactions. In the current study we recorded neurophysiological (using Magnetoencephalography) and behavioral responses from 16 healthy subjects performing an auditory detection task of faint tones. Tones were either generated by subjects voluntary button presses or occurred predictably following a visual cue. By introducing a constant temporal delay between button press/cue and tone delivery and applying source-level analysis we decoupled motor-evoked and auditory-evoked activity in auditory cortex. We show motor-related evoked-responses in auditory cortex following sound-triggering actions and preceding sound onset. Such evoked-responses were not found for button-presses that were not coupled with expected sounds. Furthermore, the amplitude of these evoked-responses corresponded with subsequent sound detection, suggesting their functional relevance to auditory processing. Our results provide first direct evidence for efferent signals in sensory cortex that are evoked by voluntary actions coupled with sensory consequences.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesCognitive and neurobehavioral abnormalities are the most common and complex complications of sickle cell disease (SCD). Known risk factors influencing abnormalities are stroke and silent cerebral infarcts, but a majority of cases do not have overt cerebral injury and the underlying mechanism is not well understood. This study aims to determine whether sickle cell mice could recapitulate features of cognitive and neurobehavioral impairment observed in sickle cell patients as well as to determine the underlying cellular mechanism of these SCD complications.\n\nMethodsUsing a longitudinal cross-sectional study design, we evaluated cognition and neurobehavioral deficits as an outcome. Six as well as 13 months old male Townes humanized sickle cell (SS) and matched control (AA) mice were tested. The combination of novel object recognition and fear conditioning tests was employed to measure anxiety/depression, learning and memory. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantify bone marrow-derived microglia (CD45+) and activated microglia (Iba1+) in the dentate and peri-dentate gyrus to determine if these factors were potential pathogenic mechanisms associated with cognitive and neurobehavioral abnormalities. We evaluated neurogenesis by measuring 5Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and doublecortin (DCX) and phenotyped proliferating cells via quantification of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP+), neuronal nuclei (NeuN+), CD45+ and Iba1+. In addition, Golgi-Cox staining was used to assess neuroplasticity via measurement of dendritic spine density and morphology, as well as dendrite arbors.\n\nResultsCompared to matched AA, 13 months old SS mice showed significant evidence of anxiety/depression by the shorter distance traveled as well as thigmotaxis. Additionally, SS mice were significantly less likely to recognize the novel object as well as have a reduced preference for the novel object. There were no significant differences between 6 months old SS and AA. But the difference reappeared after the same mice were aged to 13 months. Aged mice exhibited more anxiety/depression behaviors and thigmotaxis and were less likely to recognize or show a lower percent preference for the novel object compared to aged control (AA) mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis shows that sickle cell (SS) mice had significantly more CD45+ and Iba1+ activated microglia cells in the dentate and peri-dentate gyrus area compared to AA mice. SS mice also had a significantly lower dendritic spine density compared with controls. Treatment of aged SS mice with minocycline resulted in significant improvement of cognitive and neurobehavioral function compared to matched vehicle-treated SS mice. Also immunohistochemical and histological analysis showed that treated SS mice had significantly fewer CD45+ cells and activated microglia in the dentate and peri-dentate gyrus area. Furthermore, there was significant improvement in dendritic spine and dendrite arbor density as well as spine maturation in treated sickle cell mice compared with vehicle-treated sickle cell mice.\n\nConclusionTaken together these results indicate that age, neuro-inflammation and neuroplasticity, specifically, spine maturation and density, are possible mechanisms underlying cognition deficits in sickle cell disease. These could also be targeted as a potential approach for prevention and or treatment of cognitive and neurobehavioral deficits in SCD.",

    "abstract": "Piezo2 expression in the normal, young adult mouse brain was examined using an anti-PIEZO2 Ab generated against a C-terminal fragment of the human PIEZO2 protein. As a positive control for Ab staining of mouse neurons, the Ab was shown to stain the majority (~90%) of mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons, consistent with recent in situ hybridization and transcriptomic studies that also indicate Piezo2 gene expression in ~90% mouse DRG neurons. As a negative control and stringent test for specificity, the Ab failed to stain DRG satellite glial cells, which do not express Piezo2 but rather its paralog, Piezo1. In slices of brains isolated from the same mice as the DRG, the Ab displayed high selectivity in staining only specific neuron types, including some pyramidal neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus, Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex, and most notably mitral cells within the olfactory bulb. Given the demonstrated role of Piezo2 channels in peripheral neurons as a low-threshold pressure sensor (i.e., [&le;] 5 mm Hg) critical for gentle touch, proprioception, and the regulation of breathing and blood pressure, its expression in select brain neurons has interesting implications. In particular, we propose that the pressure sensitive channel may provide specific brain neurons with an intrinsic resonance that acts to synchronize their firing with the normal pulsatile changes in intracranial pressure (ICP) associated with breathing and cardiac cycles. This novel mechanism could serve to increase the robustness of the respiration entrained oscillations that have been recorded in both rodent and human brains across widely distributed neuronal networks. The idea of a \"global rhythm\" within the brain has been mainly related to the effect of nasal airflow activating mechanosensitive neurons within the olfactory epithelium, which in turn synchronize, through direct synaptic connections, mitral neurons within the olfactory bulb and then through their projections, the activity of neural networks in other brain regions, including the hippocampus and neocortex. Our proposed, non-synaptic, intrinsic resonance mechanism for tracking pulsatile ICP changes would have the advantage that spatially separated brain networks could be globally synchronized effectively at the speed of sound.",

Herbivory, for instance, appears to trigger local apoplasmic glutamate accumulation, systemic electrical signals and calcium waves that travel to report insect damage to neighboring leaves and initiate defense. To monitor extra- and intracellular glutamate concentrations in plants, we generated Arabidopsis lines expressing genetically encoded fluorescent glutamate sensors. In contrast to cytosolically localized sensors, extracellularly displayed variants inhibited plant growth and proper development. Phenotypic analyses of high-affinity display sensor lines revealed that root meristem development, particularly the quiescent center (QC), number of lateral roots, vegetative growth and floral architecture were impacted. Notably, the severity of the phenotypes was positively correlated with the affinity of the display sensors, intimating that their ability to sequester glutamate at the surface of the plasma membrane was responsible for the defects. Root growth defects were suppressed by supplementing culture media with low levels of glutamate. Together, the data indicate that sequestration of glutamate at the cell surface either disrupts the supply of glutamate to meristematic cells and/or impairs localized glutamatergic signaling important for developmental processes.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTGlutamate is an important signaling molecule in animals and plants. The affinity-dependent effects of surface-displayed glutamate sensors on plant development intimate that glutamate levels in the vicinity of the plasma membrane play important roles in signaling in plants.",

The MeSSII-RNAi cassava lines showed increased amylose content and reduced intermediate chain of amylopectin (B1 type) biosynthesis in their storage roots, leading to altered starch physico-chemical properties. Further gel permeation chromatography analysis of starch biosynthetic enzymes between the wild type and MeSSII-RNAi lines confirmed the key rule of MeSSII in the organization of heteromeric starch synthetic protein complexes, including the MeSSII-MeSSI-MeGBSSI and MeSBEII-MeSSI-MeSSII-MeISAII-MeISAI complexes. The lack of MeSSII in cassava also reduced the binding capacity of the MeSSI, MeSBEII, MeISAI, and MeISAII to starch granules. Our results show a close coordination between granule-bound starch synthase and amylopectin biosynthetic enzymes, which implies that the processes of amylose synthesis and amylopectin synthesis are directly interrelated. These findings shed light on the key components of the starch biosynthesis machinery in root crops.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryHere, by focusing on cassava SSII, we elucidated its function and the molecular mechanism by which it chaperones the starch synthase complex to regulate starch biosynthesis in cassava storage roots.",

    "abstract": "Polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) is a cationic polymer with antimicrobial and antiviral properties. It has been commonly accepted that the antimicrobial activity is due the ability of PHMB to perforate the bacterial phospholipid membrane leading ultimately to its death. In this study we show by the means of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that while the PHMB molecules attach to the surface of the phospholipid bilayer and partially penetrate it, they do not cause any pore formation at least within the microsecond simulation times. The polymers initially adsorb onto the membrane surface via the favourable electrostatic interactions between the phospholipid headgroups and the biguanide groups, and then partially penetrate the membrane slightly disrupting its structure. This, however, does not lead to the formation of any pores. The microsecond-scale simulations reveal that it is unlikely for PHMB to spontaneously pass through the phospholipid membrane. Our findings suggest that PHMB translocation across the bilayer may take place through binding to the phospholipids. Once inside the cell, the polymer can effectively  bind to DNA through extensive interactions with DNA phosphate backbone, which can potentially block the DNA replication process or activate DNA repair pathways.\n\nTOC Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=161 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/007732v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (93K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17c8c69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e65ceeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@df0f42org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@62ba9a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes play a central role for pathogen recognition by the adaptive immune system. The MHC genes are often duplicated and tightly linked within a small genomic region. This structural organization suggests that natural selection acts on the combined property of multiple MHC gene copies in segregating haplotypes, rather than on single MHC genes. This may have important implications for analyses of patterns of selection on MHC genes. Here, we present a computer-assisted protocol to infer segregating MHC haplotypes from family data, based on functions in the R package MHCtools. We employed this method to identify 107 unique MHC class I (MHC-I) haplotypes in 116 families of wild great reed warblers (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). In our data, the MHC-I genes were tightly linked in haplotypes and inherited as single units, with only two observed recombination events among 334 offspring. We found substantial variation in the number of different MHC-I alleles per haplotype, and the divergence between alleles in MHC-I haplotypes was significantly higher than between randomly assigned alleles in simulated haplotypes. This suggests that selection has favored non-random associations of divergent MHC-I alleles in haplotypes to increase the range of pathogens that can be recognized by the adaptive immune system. Further studies of selection on MHC haplotypes in natural populations is an interesting avenue for future research. Moreover, inference and analysis of MHC haplotypes offers important insights into the structural organization of MHC genes, and may improve the accuracy of the MHC region in de novo genome assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Promyelocytic leukaemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) possess an important intrinsic antiviral activity against -herpesvirus infection. PML is the structural backbone of NBs, comprising different isoforms. However, the contribution of each isoform to -herpesvirus restriction is not well understood. Here, we report the role of PML-NBs and swine PML (sPML) isoforms in pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection in its natural host swine cells. We found that sPML-NBs exhibit an anti-PRV activity in the context of increasing the expression level of endogenous sPML. Of four sPML isoforms cloned and examined, only isoform sPML-II/IIa, not sPML-I and IVa, expressed in a sPML knockout cells inhibits PRV infection. Both the unique 7b region of sPML-II and sumoylation-dependent normal formation of PML-NBs are required. 7b possesses a transcriptional repression activity and suppresses viral gene transcription during PRV infection with the cysteine residue 589 and 599 being critically involved. We conclude that sPML-NBs inhibit PRV infection by repressing viral gene transcription through the 7b region of sPML-II.\n\nIMPORTANCEPML-NBs are nuclear sites that mediate the antiviral restriction of -herpesvirus gene expression and replication. However, the contrition of each PML isoform to this activity of PML-NBs is not well characterized. Using PRV and its natural host swine cells as a system, we have discovered that the unique C-terminus of sPML isoform II is required for PML-NBs to inhibit PRV infection by directly engaging in repression of viral gene transcription. Our study not only confirms in swine cells that PML-NBs have an anti-viral function, but also presents a mechanism to suggest that PML-NBs inhibit viral infection in an isoform specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Microtubule-directed anti-cancer drugs, such as paclitaxel, vinblastine, and colchicine, disrupt cell mitosis through suppression of microtubule dynamics (\"kinetic stabilization\"). However, while the molecular mechanisms of paclitaxel and vinblastine act as pseudo- and true-kinetic stabilizers, respectively, the molecular mechanism of colchicine has remained enigmatic since it requires explanation of both the slow kinetics of the drug and suppression of microtubule dynamics. In this work, we applied an integrated multi-scale modeling-experimental approach to systematically characterize the microtubule targeting agent (MTA) colchicine. We found that colchicine stabilizes microtubule dynamics significantly both in vivo and in vitro in a time and concentration-dependent manner. Molecular modeling results suggest that tubulins binding pocket is accessible to the drug for only 15% of the simulation trajectory time in straight and 82% in curved conformation on average, confirming that colchicine mainly binds to free tubulin. Molecular dynamics simulations show that there are conformational changes at longitudinal and lateral residues of GTP-tubulin-colchicine compared to a lattice tubulin structure, explaining why further incorporation of tubulin dimers to a tubulin-colchicine complex at a protofilament tip is unfavorable. Thermokinetic modeling of microtubule assembly shows that colchicine bound at fractions as low as [~]0.008 to free tubulin can poison the ends of protofilaments with a Poisson distribution and thus, reduce the microtubule growth rate, while stabilizing the tubulin lateral bond and reducing the microtubule shortening rate, i.e. true kinetic stabilization. This study suggests new strategies for colchicine administration to improve the therapeutic window in the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases.\n\nSignificance StatementColchicine is an ancient microtubule targeting agent (MTA) known to attenuate microtubule (MT) dynamics but its cancer treatment efficacy is often limited by lack of a detailed understanding of the drugs mechanism of action. The primary goal of this study was to perform a multi-scale systematic analysis of molecular mechanism of action of colchicine. The analysis indicates that unlike paclitaxel and vinblastine, colchicine poisons the ends of protofilaments of MTs at low fractions bound to tubulin, in a time-dependent manner. Our results suggest new insights into improvement of the clinical administration of colchicine and new colchicine-site inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Size-based harvest limits or gear regulations are often used to manage fishing mortality and ensure the spawning biomass of females is sufficiently protected. Yet, management interactions with species\u2019 mating systems that affect fishery sustainability and yield are rarely considered. For species with obligate male care, it is possible that size-specific harvest of males will decrease larval production. In order to examine how size-based management practices interact with mating systems, we modeled fisheries of two species with obligate care of nests, corkwing wrasse (Symphodus melops, Labridae) and lingcod (Ophiodon elongatus, Hexigrammidae) under two management scenarios, a minimum size limit and a harvest slot limit. We simulated the population dynamics, larval production, and yield to the fishery under a range of fishing mortalities. We also modeled size-dependent male care to determine its interaction with management. In both species, the slot limit decreased yield by less than 12% (relative to minimum size limits) at low fishing mortalities; at higher mortalities, individuals rarely survived to outgrow the slot and spawning potential decreased substantially relative to unfished levels, similar to minimum size limits. Spawning potential decreased less when managed with a slot limit if we included a positive feedback between male size, care, and hatching success, but the benefit of implementing the slot depended both on the relative proportions of each sex selected by the fishery, and on our assumptions regarding male size and care. This work highlights that the effects of size- and sex-selective fisheries management can be nuanced and produce counter-intuitive results.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The oxylipins, 7S,14S-diHDHA and 7S,17S-diHDHA (RvD5), have been found in macrophages exudates and are believed to function as specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs). Their biosynthesis is thought to proceed through sequential oxidations of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) by lipoxygenase enzymes, specifically by h5-LOX first to 7S-HDHA, followed by h12-LOX to form 7S,14S-diHDHA or h15-LOX-1 to form 7S,17S-diHDHA (RvD5). In this work, we determined that oxidation of 7S-HpDHA to 7S,14S-diHDHA can be performed by either h12-LOX or h15-LOX-1, with similar kinetics. The oxidation at C14 of DHA by h12-LOX was expected, but the non-canonical reaction of h15-LOX-1 to make primarily 7S,14S-diHDHA was unexpected. Computer modeling suggests the alcohol on C7 of 7S-HDHA hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl of I399, forcing the hydrogen abstraction from C12 to oxygenate on C14, and not C17. This result raised questions regarding synthesis of 7S,17S-diHDHA (RvD5). Strikingly, we find h15-LOX-2 oxygenates 7S-HDHA almost exclusively at C17, forming RvD5 with faster kinetics than h15-LOX-1. The presence of h15-LOX-2 in neutrophils and macrophages, suggests it may have a greater role in biosynthesizing SPMs than previously thought. We also determined that the reactions of h5-LOX with 14S-HpDHA and 17S-HpDHA are kinetically slow compared to DHA, suggesting these may be minor biosynthetic routes in-vivo. Additionally, we show that 7S,14S-diHDHA and RvD5 have anti-aggregation properties with platelets at low micro-molar potencies, which could directly regulate clot resolution.",

    "abstract": "Additive manufacturing allows three-dimensional printing of polymeric materials together with cells, creating living materials for applications in biomedical research and biotechnology. However, understanding the cellular phenotype within living materials is lacking and a key limitation for their wider application. Herein, we present an approach to characterize the cellular phenotype within living materials. We immobilized the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae in three different photocross-linkable triblock polymeric hydrogels containing F127-bis-urethane methacrylate, F127-dimethacrylate, or poly(alkyl glycidyl ether)-dimethacrylate. Using optical and scanning electron microscopy, we showed that hydrogels based on these polymers were stable under physiological conditions, but yeast colonies showed differences in the interaction within the living materials. We found that the physical confinement, imparted by compositional and structural properties of the hydrogels, impacted the cellular phenotype by reducing the size of cells in living materials compared with suspension cells. These properties also contributed to the differences in immobilization patterns, growth of colonies, and colony coatings. We observed that a composition-dependent degradation of polymers was likely possible by cells residing in the living materials. In conclusion, our investigation highlights the need for a holistic understanding of the cellular response within hydrogels to facilitate the synthesis of application-specific polymers and the design of advanced living materials in the future.",

    "abstract": "The recent pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). COVID-19 was first reported in China (December 2019) and now prevalent in [~]170 countries across the globe. Entry of SARS-CoV-2 into mammalian cells require the binding of viral Spike (S) proteins to the ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) receptor. Once entered the S protein is primed by a specialised serine protease, TMPRSS2 (Transmembrane Serine Protease 2) in the host cell. Importantly, beside respiratory symptoms, consistent with other common respiratory virus infection when patients become viraemic, a significant number of COVID-19 patients also develop liver comorbidities. We explored if specific target cell-type in the mammalian liver, could be implicated in disease pathophysiology other than the general deleterious response to cytokine storms. Here we employed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) to survey the human liver and identified potentially implicated liver cell-type for viral ingress. We report the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in a TROP2+ liver progenitor population. Importantly, we fail to detect the expression of ACE2 in hepatocyte or any other liver (immune and stromal) cell types. These results indicated that in COVID-19 associated liver dysfunction and cell death, viral infection of TROP2+ progenitors in liver may significantly impaired liver regeneration and could lead to pathology.\n\nHighlights- EPCAM+ Liver progenitors co-express ACE2 and TMPRSS2\n- ACE2 and TMPRSS2 expression is highest in TROP2high progenitors\n- ACE2 and TMPRSS2 cells express cholangiocyte biased fate markers\n- ACE2 and TMPRSS2 positive cells are absent in human fetal liver",

We show that CSN is an essential upstream regulator of parasite protein degradation. Genetic disruption of E. histolytica CSN by two distinct approaches inhibited cell proliferation and viability. Both CSN5 knockdown and dominant negative mutation trapped cullin in a neddylated state, disrupting UPS activity and protein degradation.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is a growing interest in using gut commensal bacteria as  next generation probiotics. However, this approach is still hampered by the fact that there are few or no strains available for specific species that are difficult to cultivate. Our objective was therefore to adapt flow cytometry and cell sorting to be able to detect, separate, isolate and cultivate new strains of Extremely Oxygen Sensitive (EOS) species from fecal material, focusing on Faecalibacterium prausnitzii as a proof-of-concept.\n\nResultsA BD Influx(R) cell sorter was equipped with a glovebox that covers the sorting area. This box is flushed with nitrogen to deplete oxygen in the enclosure. Several non-specific staining methods including Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA), Vancomycin BODIPY and LIVE/DEAD BacLight were evaluated with three different strains of the EOS species F. prausnitzii. In parallel, we generated polyclonal antibodies directed against this species by immunizing rabbits with heat-inactivated bacteria. Anaerobic conditions were maintained during the full process, resulting in only minor viability loss during sorting and culture of unstained F. prausnitzii reference strains. In addition, staining solutions did not severely impact bacterial viability while allowing discrimination between groups of strains. Efficient detection was achieved using polyclonal antibodies directed against heat-fixed bacteria. Finally, we were able to detect, isolate and cultivate a variety of F. prausnitzii strains from healthy volunteers fecal samples using WGA staining and antibodies. These strains present markedly different phenotypes, thus confirming the heterogeneity of the species.\n\nConclusionsCell-sorting in anaerobic conditions is a promising tool for the study of fecal microbiota. It gives the opportunity to quickly analyze microbial populations and to sort strains of interest using specific antibodies, thus opening new avenues for targeted culturomics experiments.",

    "abstract": "We consider a cerebellar ring network for the optokinetic response (OKR), and investigate the effect of diverse recoding of granule (GR) cells on OKR by varybing the connection probability pc from Golgi to GR cells. For an optimal value of [Formula], individual GR cells exhibit diverse spiking patterns which are in-phase, anti-phase, or complex out-of-phase with respect to their population-averaged firing activity. Then, these diversely-recoded signals via parallel fibers (PFs) from GR cells are effectively depressed by the error-teaching signals via climbing fibers from the inferior olive which are also in-phase ones. Synaptic weights at in-phase PF-Purkinje cell (PC) synapses of active GR cells are strongly depressed via strong long-term depression (LTD), while those at anti-phase and complex out-of-phase PF-PC synapses are weakly depressed through weak LTD. This kind of \"effective\" depression (i.e., strong/weak LTD) at the PF-PC synapses causes a big modulation in firings of PCs, which then exert effective inhibitory coordination on the vestibular nucleus (VN) neuron (which evokes OKR). For the firing of the VN neuron, the learning gain degree [L]g, corresponding to the modulation gain ratio, increases with increasing the learning cycle, and it saturates at about the 300th cycle. By varying pc from [Formula], we find that a plot of saturated learning gain degree [Formula] versus pc forms a bell-shaped curve with a peak at [Formula] (where the diversity degree in spiking patterns of GR cells is also maximum). Consequently, the more diverse in recoding of GR cells, the more effective in motor learning for the OKR adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Tau aggregation into amyloid fibers based on the cross-beta structure is a hallmark of several Tauopathies, including Alzheimer Disease (AD). Trans-cellular propagation of Tau with pathological conformation has been suggested as a key disease mechanism. This is thought to cause the spreading of Tau pathology in AD by templated conversion of naive Tau in recipient cells into a pathological state, followed by assembly of pathological Tau fibers, similar to the mechanism proposed for prion pathogenesis. In cell cultures, the process is usually monitored by a FRET assay where the recipient cell expresses the Tau repeat domain (TauRD, with pro-aggregant mutation, e.g., {Delta}K280 or P301L, [~]13.5 kDa) fused to GFP-based FRET pairs (YFP or CFP, [~]28 kD). Since the diameter of the reporter GFP ([~]3 nm) is [~]6.5 times larger than the {beta}-strand distance (0.47nm), this points to a potential steric clash. Hence, we investigated the influence of GFP tagged (N- or C-terminally) TauRD and TauFL (full-length Tau) on their aggregation behavior in vitro. Using biophysical methods (light scattering, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and scanning-transmission electron microscopy (STEM)), we found that the assembly of TauRD{Delta}K-GFP was severely inhibited, even in the presence of nucleation enhancers (heparin and/or pre-formed PHFs from TauRD{Delta}K). Some rare fiber-like particles had a very different subunit packing from proper PHFs, as judged by STEM. The mass per length (MPL) values of TauRD{Delta}K fibrils are equivalent to 4.45 molecules/nm, close to the expected value for a paired-helical fiber with 2 protofilaments and cross-{beta} structure. By contrast, the elongated particles formed by TauRD{Delta}K-GFP have MPL values around [~]2, less than half of the values expected for PHFs, indicating that the subunit packing is distinct. Thus, both kinetic and structural observations are incompatible with a model whereby external Tau can form a template for PHF assembly of Tau-GFP in recipient cells. As a consequence, the observed local increase of FRET in recipient cells must be caused by other signalling processes.",

    "abstract": "The superior colliculus (SC) is a midbrain structure that receives diverse and robust cortical inputs to drive a range of cognitive and sensorimotor behaviors. However, it remains unclear how descending cortical inputs arising from higher-order associative areas coordinate with SC sensorimotor networks to influence its outputs. In this study, we constructed a comprehensive map of all cortico-tectal projections and identified four collicular zones with differential cortical inputs: medial (SC.m), centromedial (SC.cm), centrolateral (SC.cl) and lateral (SC.l). Computational analyses revealed that cortico-tectal projections are organized as multiple subnetworks that are consistent with previously identified cortico-cortical and cortico-striatal subnetworks. Furthermore, we delineated the brain-wide input/output organization of each collicular zone and described a subset of their constituent neuronal cell types based on distinct connectional and morphological features. Altogether, this work provides a novel structural foundation for the integrative role of the SC in controlling cognition, orientation, and other sensorimotor behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The fundamental distinction of grammatical deficits in aphasia, agrammatism and paragrammatism, was made over a century ago. However, the extent to which the agrammatism/paragrammatism distinction exists independently of differences in speech fluency has not clearly been investigated. Despite much research on agrammatism, the lesion correlates of paragrammatism are essentially unknown. Lesion-symptom mapping was used to investigate the degree to which the lesion correlates of agrammatism and paragrammatism overlap or dissociate. Four expert raters assessed videos of 53 right-handed patients with aphasia following chronic left hemisphere stroke retelling the Cinderella story. Consensus discussion determined each subjects classification with respect to grammatical deficits as Agrammatic, Paragrammatic, Both, or No Grammatical Deficit. Each subjects lesion was manually drawn on a high-resolution MRI and warped to standard space for group analyses. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses were performed in NiiStat including lesion volume as a covariate. Secondary analyses included speech rate (words per minute) as an additional covariate. Region of interest analyses identified a double dissociation between these syndromes: damage to Brocas area was significantly associated with agrammatism, p = 0.001 (but not paragrammatism, p = 0.930), while damage to the left posterior superior and middle temporal gyri was significantly associated with paragrammatism, p < 0.001 (but not agrammatism, p = 0.873). The same results obtained when regressing out the effect of speech rate, and non-overlapping lesion distributions between the syndromes were confirmed by uncorrected whole brain analyses. Our results support a fundamental distinction between agrammatism and paragrammatism.",

    "abstract": "The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) appears to support decisions by encoding the effort-reward utility of choice options. We show here that d-amphetamine (AMPH) has dose-dependent effects on this encoding and on neural dynamics in rat ACC that are concordant with its behavioral effects. Low-dose AMPH increased task engagement and had mild effects on neural encoding, whereas high doses disrupted utility signaling and decreased task engagement. The disruption involved reduced reward signaling and compressed effort-reward encoding of utility cells, which corresponded with reduced reward consumption behaviors. Furthermore, low-dose AMPH stabilized and accelerated trajectories of neural activity in state-space, whereas high-dose AMPH destabilized trajectories. We propose that low-dose AMPH increases both excitability and stability, which preserves information and accelerates evolution of a neural  script for task execution. Excessive excitability at high doses overcomes stability enhancement to suppress weakly encoded features (e.g. reward) and cause deviation from the script, which interrupts task performance.\n\nSignificance StatementAmphetamine reduced reward signaling by individual neurons in rat prefrontal cortex, but increased the stability of ensemble dynamics. These effects account for animals increased task engagement, despite reduced reward intake.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReversal of heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI) remains a global challenge. The goal of a clinical physician is to prevent heart failure immediately following the infarct. Since traditional strategies are only partially helpful for improving cardiac function, there is an urgency to identify novel approaches to maintain cardiac function.\n\nObjectivesThe aim of this study was to determine the role of Kruppel-Like Factor 14 (KLF14) in the heart post-MI.\n\nMethods and ResultsWild-type and KLF14 overexpression mice were subjected to MI. At four weeks following MI, the infarct size was significantly reduced, left ventricular fraction shortening was significantly preserved, and left ventricular chamber dilation was attenuated in the KLF14 overexpression group. Transmission electron microscopy studies revealed striking evidence of decreased mitochondrial damage in the KLF14 overexpression myocardium following MI. To gain insight into the underlying relationship between KLF14 and mitochondria, we examined a broad array of genes involved in mitochondrial function and found that KLF14 overexpression was involved in the decreased apoptosis of mitochondria induced by H2O2. This beneficial effect was associated with increased levels of PGC-1.\n\nConclusionsThese results demonstrate that KLF14 plays a critical protective role in the heart after MI by regulating mitochondrial function, which may be achieved by regulating PGC-1.",

    "abstract": "Smoke inhalation injury is the leading cause of death in firefighters and victims. Inhaled hot air and toxic smoke are the predominant hazards to the respiratory epithelium. We aimed to analyze the effects of thermal stress and smoke aldehyde on the permeability of the airway epithelial barrier. Transepithelial resistance (RTE) and short-circuit current (ISC) of mouse tracheal epithelial monolayers were digitized by an Ussing chamber setup. Zonula occludens-1 tight junctions were visualized under confocal microscopy. A cell viability test and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran assay were performed. Thermal stress (40\u00b0C) decreased RTE in a two-phase manner. Meanwhile, thermal stress increased ISC followed by its decline. Na+ depletion, amiloride (an inhibitor for epithelial Na+ channels [ENaCs]), ouabain (a blocker for Na+/K+-ATPase) and CFTRinh-172 (a blocker of cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator [CFTR]) altered the responses of RTE and ISC to thermal stress. Steady-state 40\u00b0C increased activity of ENaCs, Na+/K+-ATPase, and CFTR. Acrolein, one of the main oxidative unsaturated aldehydes in fire smoke, eliminated RTE and ISC. Na+ depletion, amiloride, ouabain, and CFTRinh-172 suppressed acrolein-sensitive ISC, but showed activating effects on acrolein-sensitive RTE. Thermal stress or acrolein disrupted zonula occludens-1 tight junctions, increased fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran permeability but did not cause cell death or detachment. The synergistic effects of thermal stress and acrolein exacerbated the damage to monolayers. In conclusion, the paracellular pathway mediated by the tight junctions and the transcellular pathway mediated by active and passive ion transport pathways contribute to impairment of the airway epithelial barrier caused by thermal stress and acrolein.Graphical HeadlightsThermal stress and acrolein are two essential determinants for smoke-inhalation injury, impairing airway epithelial barrier.Transcellular ion transport pathways via the ENaC, CFTR, and Na/K-ATPase are interrupted by both thermal stress and acrolein, one of the most potent smoke toxins.Heat and acrolein damage the integrity of the airway epithelium through suppressing and relocating the tight junctions.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.AbbreviationsENaCsepithelial Na+ channelsCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane regulatorRTEtransepithelial resistanceISCshort-circuit currentMTEmouse tracheal epithelialFITCfluorescein isothiocyanateHBEhuman bronchial epithelialDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideZO-1zonula occludens-1P1phase 1P2phase 2ASIamiloride-sensitive ISCKCsK+ channelsROSreactive oxygen speciesCaCCsCa2+-activated Cl\u2212 channelsNKCCNa+/K+/2Cl\u2212MAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseView Full Text",

    "abstract": "The observation of initial transport of fixed nitrogen in intact soybean plants in real-time was conducted by using the positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS). Soybean root nodules were fed with [13N]N2 for 10 minutes, and the radioactivity of [13N]N tracer was recorded for 60 minutes. The serial images of nitrogen fixation activity and translocation of fixed nitrogen in the soybean plant were reconstructed to estimate the fixed-N transport to the upper shoot. As a result, the signal of nitrogen radiotracer moving upward through the intact stem was successfully observed. This is the first report that the translocation of fixed-N is visualized in real-time in soybean plant by a moving image. The signal of nitrogen radiotracer appeared at the base stem at about 20 minutes after the feeding of tracer gas and it took 40 minutes to reach the upper stem. The velocity of fixed nitrogen translocation was estimated approximately at 1.63 cm min-1. The autoradiography taken after PETIS experiment showed a clear picture of transport of fixed 13N in the whole plant that the fixed-N moved not only via xylem system but also via the phloem system to the shoot after transferring from xylem to phloem in the stem although it has been generally considered that the fixed-N in nodule is transported dominantly via xylem by transpiration stream toward mature leaves. This result also suggests that the initial transport of fixed-N was mainly into the stem and subsequently translocated to young leaves and buds via the phloem system. These new findings in the initial transport of fixed nitrogen of soybean by PETIS observation will become the basis for future study of fixed-N transport in the whole legume plants.",

    "abstract": "Many marine invertebrate phyla are characterized by indirect development. These animals transit from planktonic larvae to benthic adults via settlement and metamorphosis, which contributes to the adaption to the marine environment. Studying the biological process of metamorphosis is thus a key to understand the origin and evolution of indirect development. Numerous studies have been conducted on the relationships of metamorphosis with the marine environment, microorganisms, as well as the neurohormones, however, little is known on the gene regulation network (GRN) dynamics during metamorphosis. Metamorphosis competent pediveliger of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas was assayed in this study. By identifying genes enriched in competent pediveliger and early spat, as well as pediveligers treated with epinephrine, the dynamics of genes and proteins was examined with transcriptomics and proteomics methods. The results indicated significantly different gene regulation networks before, during, and post metamorphosis. Genes encoding membrane integrated receptors and related to the remodeling of the nervous system were upregulated before the initiation of metamorphosis. Massive biogenesis, e.g., various enzymes and structural proteins, occurred during metamorphosis. Correspondingly, the protein synthesis system was comprehensively activated after epinephrine stimulation. Hierarchical downstream gene networks were also stimulated, where some transcription factors showed different temporal response patterns, including some important Homeobox, basic helix-loop-helix factors and nuclear receptors. Nuclear receptors, as well as their retinoic acid receptor partners, should play critical roles during the oyster metamorphosis, although they may not be responsible for the initiation process. Enriched genes in early spat were mainly related to environmental stress responses, indicating the GRN complexity of the transition stage during oyster metamorphosis.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "The control of Hsp70 functions has been related to the modulation of ATP hydrolysis and substrate capture by Hsp40. Structural and biophysical analyses of Hsp40 variants and their interactions with Hsp70 have identified key residues for this functional control mechanism. Conserved residues in both Hsp40 and Hsp70 have revealed conserved interactions that link Hsp40 binding to the catalytic residues within Hsp70. The current work investigates the effect of documented J-domain dysfunctional mutations (i.e. D35N, H33Q) on the described interaction linkage. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to compare the persistence of individual bond types (i.e. H-bonds, salt bridges, hydrophobic interactions) between Hsp70 and the bound forms of functional and dysfunctional Hsp40 variants. The generated data suggests the involvement of both direct and allosteric effects for the tested mutations. The observed changes relate mutations in the conserved HPD tripeptide of Hsp40 to alterations in the interaction network that induces Hsp70 chaperone functions.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThe significance of the work may be summarized as follows. First, the interaction network for the simulated systems were observed to be different from one previously proposed for a disulfide linked complex (9). This may be attributed to altered residue movement and interactions without the restrictions set by the disulfide link. These results support the use of in silico methods to refine investigations of molecular contacts, particularly for systems, whose in vitro structural elucidation are difficult to achieve without modifications.\n\nSecond, key interactions for intermolecular and intramolecular contacts were observed within a short simulation time (0.1 ns) matched those from much longer runs (500 ns) (4). This result highlights the possibility of identifying key interactions with relatively low computational cost.",

Much of the validation of bioinformatic tools for this long-read data has focussed on calling germline variants (including structural variants). Somatic variants are outnumbered many-fold by germline variants and their detection is further complicated by the effects of tumour purity/subclonality. Here, we evaluate the extent to which Nanopore sequencing enables genome-wide detection and analysis of somatic variation. We do this through sequencing tumour and germline genomes for a patient with diffuse B-cell lymphoma and comparing results with 150bp short-read sequencing of the same samples. Calling germline single nucleotide variants (SNVs) from the long-read data achieved good specificity and sensitivity. However, results of somatic SNV calling highlight the need for the development of specialized joint calling algorithms. We find the comparative performance of different tools varies significantly between structural variant types, and suggest long reads are especially advantageous for calling large somatic deletions and duplications. Finally, we highlight the utility of long reads for phasing clinically relevant variants, confirming that a somatic 1.6Mb deletion and a p.(Arg249Met) mutation involving TP53 are oriented in trans.",

    "abstract": "The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is used to measure high-level Theory of Mind. RMET consists of images of the regions surrounding the eyes and a glossary of terms that defines words associated with the gazes depicted in the images. People must identify the meaning associated with each gaze and can consult the glossary as they respond. The results indicate that typically developed adults perform better than adults with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the evidence regarding the validity and reliability of the test is contradictory. This study evaluated the effect of the glossary on the performance, internal consistency, and temporal stability of the test. A total of 89 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to three conditions. The first group used the original glossary (Ori-G). The second group developed a self-generated glossary of gazes (Self-G). Finally, the third group developed a glossary that did not define gazes, but unrelated words instead (No-G). The test was administered before and after participants drew a randomly assigned image as a secondary task. The findings show that the number of correct answers was similar among the three conditions before and after the secondary task. However, the Self-G and No-G groups took less time to finish the test. The type of glossary affected the consistency and stability of the test. In our case, the Self-G condition made the responses faster, more consistent, and more stable. The results are discussed in terms of levels of processing and the detection of mental states based on gazes.",

    "abstract": "There is clinical demand for simple and contact-free diagnosis techniques in medical practice. This study shows that the infrared absorptions of volatile metabolites can be used to distinguish between the air around Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, other bacteria, and normal room air. Gas samples were collected from the air surrounding single and mixed laboratory cultures, and preliminary data on human breath samples are also presented. The infrared spectra of a variety of gasses are measured with a high resolution of 0.5 cm-1 to obtain information about the wavenumber position of the key bands. Hence, it is not necessary to specify the molecular species of biomarkers. This work also shows that discrimination rates can be improved by observing additional infrared absorptions caused by different characteristic volatile molecules. The significance of this work is that the specific wavenumber positions of the key bands that allow the application of infrared lasers are provided. As a result, it is considered that Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii can be monitored more sensitively and easily. With further research and development, this simple approach could be used in future applications to identify infections in healthcare settings.",

    "abstract": "The Sp family of transcription factors plays important functions during development and disease. An evolutionary conserved role for some Sp family members is the control of limb development. The family is characterized by the presence of three C2H2-type zinc fingers and an adjacent 10 aa region with an unknown function called the Buttonhead (BTD) box. The presence of this BTD-box in all Sp family members identified from arthropods to vertebrates, suggests that it plays an important role during development. However, despite its conservation, the in vivo function of the BTD-box has never been studied. In this work, we have generated specific BTD-box deletion alleles for the Drosophila Sp family members Sp1 and buttonhead (btd) using gene editing tools and analyzed its role during development. Unexpectedly, btd and Sp1 mutant alleles that lack the BTD-box are viable and have almost normal appendages. However, in a sensitized background the requirement of this domain to fully regulate some of Sp1 and Btd target genes is revealed. Furthermore, we have also identified a novel Sp1 role promoting leg vs antenna identity through the repression of spineless (ss) expression in the leg, a function that also depends on the Sp1 BTD-box.",

    "abstract": "East Coast fever (ECF) and Corridor disease (CD) caused by cattle- and buffalo-derived T. parva respectively are the most economically important tick-borne diseases of cattle in the affected African countries. The p67 gene has been evaluated as a recombinant subunit vaccine against East Coast fever (ECF), and for discrimination of T. parva parasites causing ECF and Corridor disease (CD). The p67 allele type 1 was first identified in cattle-derived T. parva parasites from east Africa, where parasites possessing this allele type have been associated with ECF. Subsequent characterization of buffalo-derived T. parva parasites from South Africa where ECF was eradicated, revealed the presence of a similar allele type, raising concerns as to whether or not allele type 1 from parasites from the two regions is identical. A 900 bp central fragment of the gene encoding p67 was PCR amplified from T. parva DNA extracted from blood collected from cattle and buffalo in South Africa, Mozambique, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, followed by DNA sequence analysis. Four p67 allele types previously described were identified. A subtype of p67 allele type 1 was identified in parasites from clinical cases of CD and buffalo from southern Africa. Notably, p67 allele type 1 sequences from parasites associated with ECF in East Africa and CD in Kenya were identical. Analysis of two p67 B-cell epitopes (TpM12 and AR22.7) revealed amino acid substitutions in allele type 1 from buffalo-derived T. parva parasites from southern Africa. However, both epitopes were conserved in allele type 1 from cattle- and buffalo-derived T. parva parasites from East Africa. These findings reveal detection of a subtype of p67 allele type 1 associated with T. parva parasites transmissible from buffalo to cattle in southern Africa.",

Two radiologists independently reviewed each observation in 80 kVp CT and 80/Sn150 kVp CT. Modified line-density profile of the tumor and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were measured. Diagnostic confidence, lesion conspicuity, and subjective image quality were calculated and compared between image sets.\n\nResultsModified line-density profile analysis revealed higher attenuation differences between the tumor and the normal tissue in 80 kVp CT than in 80/Sn150 kVp CT (127 vs. 107, P = 0.05). The 80 kVp CT showed increased CNR in the liver (8.0 vs. 7.6) and the aorta (18.9 vs. 16.3) than the 80/Sn150 kVp CT. The 80 kVp CT yielded higher enhancement of organs (4.9 {+/-} 0.2 vs. 4.7 {+/-} 0.4, P < 0.001) and lesion conspicuity (4.9 {+/-} 0.3 vs. 4.8 {+/-} 0.5, P = 0.035) than the 80/Sn150 kVp CT; overall image quality and confidence index were comparable. The effective dose reduced by 45.2% with 80 kVp CT (2.3 mSv {+/-} 0.9) compared to 80/Sn150 kVp CT (4.1 mSv {+/-} 1.5).\n\nConclusionsThe 80 kVp CT performed similar or better than 80/Sn150 kVp CT for abdominal tumor evaluation with 45.2% radiation dose reduction in oncology patients.",

    "abstract": "Voles can reach high densities with multi-annual population fluctuations of large amplitude, and they are at the base of large and rich communities of predators in temperate and arctic food webs. This status places them at the heart of management conflicts wherein crop protection and health concerns are often raised against conservation issues. Here, a 20-year survey describes the effects of large variations in grassland vole populations on the densities and the daily theoretical food intakes (TFI) of vole predators based on roadside counts. Our results show how the predator community responds to prey variations of large amplitude and how it reorganized with the increase in a dominant predator, here the red fox, which likely negatively impacted hare, European wildcat and domestic cat populations. They also indicate which subset of predator species might have a role in vole population control in the critical phase of a low density of grassland voles. Our study provides empirical support for more timely and better focused actions in wildlife management and vole population control, and it supports an evidence-based and constructive dialogue about management targets and options between all stakeholders of such socio-ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus exhibits autophagic and necroptotic process when its GPI anchor synthesis is suppressed. A putative kinase (AFUA_6G02590) is found to be overexpressed in response to GPI anchor suppression and identified as a RIP3-like protein, namely AfRip3. To elucidate its function, in this study a Afrip3-overexpressing strain OE-Afrip3 was constructed. Although OE-Afrip3 strain exhibited an increased cell death, neither apoptotic nor autophagic process was activated. Our evidences demonstrated that overexpression of Afrip3 gene in A. fumigatus only led to necroptosis, while the Afrip3-knockout mutant was unable to activate necroptotic process. Further analysis revealed that both JNK and SMase pathways were activated in OE-Afrip3 strain, by which an increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was induced. We also showed that expression of Afrip3 gene was induced by Ca2+. In addition, eEF1B{gamma} and adenylylsulfate kinase (ASK) were identified as potential candidates to interact with AfRip3. These results indicate that AfRip3 is a key modulator that activates necroptotic process in A. fumigatus, which can be induced by Ca2+ and in turn activate JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase) and SMase (sphingomyelinase) pathway. Our findings suggest that necroptotic pathway in A. fumigatus is distinct from that in mammalian cell and may provide a new strategy for development of anti-fungal drug.\n\nAuthor summaryAspergillus fumigatus is a human fungal pathogen and causes invasive aspergillosis (IA) in immunocompromised patients with high mortality (30-95%). Development of novel therapies is urgently needed. In this study, we confirm AfRip3 (AFUA_6G02590), a RIP3-like protein, is a key modulator that activates necroptotic process in A. fumigatus. We also find that cytosolic Ca2+ can induce the expression of Afrip3 and activated AfRip3 in turn activate JNK (c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase) and SMase (sphingomyelinase) pathway.

    "abstract": "Skin color patterns are ubiquitous in nature, evolve rapidly, and impact social behavior1, predator avoidance2, and protection from ultraviolet irradiation3. A leading model system for vertebrate skin patterning is the zebrafish4-7; its alternating blue stripes and yellow interstripes depend on guanine crystal-containing cells called iridophores that reflect light. It was suggested that the zebrafishs alternating color pattern arises from a single type of iridophore migrating differentially to stripes and interstripes7-9. When we tracked iridophores, however, we found they did not migrate between stripes and interstripes but instead differentiated and proliferated in place based on their micro-environment. RNA seq analysis further revealed stripe and interstripe iridophores had different transcriptomic states, while cryogenic scanning electron microscopy and micro-X-ray diffraction showed they had different guanine crystal organizations and responsiveness to norepinephrine, all indicating that stripe and interstripe iridophores are different cell types. Based on these results, we present a new model of skin patterning in zebrafish in which distinct iridophore crystallotypes containing specialized, physiologically responsive, subcellular organelles arise in stripe and interstripe zones by in situ differentiation. In this model, pattern phenotype depends not only on interactions among pigment cells that affect their arrangements, but also on factors that specify subcellular organization and physiological responsiveness of specialized organelles.",

    "abstract": "The biosynthesis of many sulfur-containing molecules depends on cysteine as a sulfur source. Cysteine desulfurase (CD) and rhodanese (Rhd) domain-containing protein families participate in the trafficking of sulfur for various metabolic pathways in bacteria and human, but their connection is not yet described in plants. The existence of natural chimeric proteins, however, containing both CD and Rhd domains in specific bacterial genera suggests a general interaction between both proteins. We report here the biochemical relationships between two cytosolic proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, a Rhd domain containing protein, the sulfurtransferase 18 (STR18), and a CD isoform referred to as ABA3, and compare these biochemical features to those of a natural CD-Rhd fusion protein from the bacterium Pseudorhodoferax sp.. We observed that the bacterial enzyme is bifunctional exhibiting both CD and STR activities using L-cysteine and thiosulfate as sulfur donors but preferentially uses L-cysteine to catalyze trans-persulfidation reactions. In vitro activity assays and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that STR18 stimulates the CD activity of ABA3 by reducing the intermediate persulfide on its catalytic cysteine thereby accelerating the overall transfer reaction. Both proteins interact in planta and form an efficient sulfur relay system whereby STR18 catalyzes trans-persulfidation reactions from ABA3 to the model acceptor protein roGFP2. In conclusion, the ABA3-STR18 couple likely represents an uncharacterized pathway of sulfur trafficking in the cytosol of plant cells, independent of ABA3 function in molybdenum cofactor maturation.",

    "abstract": "The membrane shaping ability of PACSIN2 via its FCH-BAR (F-BAR) domain has been shown to be essential for caveolar morphogenesis, presumably through the shaping of the caveolar neck. Caveolar membrane contains abundant levels of cholesterol. However, the role of cholesterol in PACSIN2-mediated membrane deformation remains unclear. We show that the binding of PACSIN2 to the membrane could be negatively regulated by the amount of cholesterol in the membrane. We prepared a reconstituted membrane based on the lipid composition of caveolae. The reconstituted membrane with cholesterol had a weaker affinity to the F-BAR domain of PACSIN2 than the membrane without cholesterol, presumably due to a decrease in electrostatic charge density. Consistently, the acute depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane resulted in the appearance of PACSIN2-localized tubules with caveolin-1 at their tips, suggesting that the presence of cholesterol inhibited the prominent membrane tubulation by PACSIN2. The tubules induced by PACSIN2 were suggested to be an intermediate of caveolae endocytosis. Consistently, the removal of caveolae from the plasma membrane upon cholesterol depletion was diminished in the cells deficient in PACSIN2. These data suggested that PACSIN2 mediated the caveolae internalization dependently on the amount of cholesterol at the plasma membrane, providing a possible mechanism for the cholesterol-dependent regulation of caveolae.",

    "abstract": "Neural stem cells divide during embryogenesis and post embryonic development to generate the entire complement of neurons and glia in the nervous system of vertebrates and invertebrates. Studies of the mechanisms controlling the fine balance between neural stem cells and more differentiated progenitors have shown that in every asymmetric cell division progenitors send a Delta-Notch signal back to their sibling stem cells. Here we show that excessive activation of Notch or overexpression of its direct targets of the Hes family causes stem-cell hyperplasias in the Drosophila larval central nervous system, which can progress to malignant tumours after allografting to adult hosts. We combined transcriptomic data from these hyperplasias with chromatin occupancy data for Dpn, a Hes transcription factor, to identify genes regulated by Hes factors in this process. We show that the Notch/Hes axis represses a cohort of transcription factor genes. These are excluded from the stem cells and promote early differentiation steps, most likely by preventing the reversion of immature progenitors to a stem-cell fate. Our results suggest that Notch signalling sets up a network of mutually repressing stemness and anti-stemness transcription factors, which include Hes proteins and Zfh1, respectively. This mutual repression ensures robust transition to neuronal and glial differentiation and its perturbation can lead to malignant transformation.",

    "abstract": "Brain glycogen has a long and versatile history: Primarily regarded as an evolutionary remnant, it was then thought of as an unspecific emergency fuel store. A dynamic role for glycogen in normal brain function has been proposed later but exclusively attributed to astrocytes, its main storage site. Neuronal glycogen had long been neglected, but came into focus when sensitive technical methods allowed quantification of glycogen at low concentration range and the detection of glycogen metabolizing enzymes in cells and cell lysates. Recently, an active role of neuronal glycogen and even its contribution to neuronal survival could be demonstrated. Our studies continue these investigations on the function and regulation of neuronal glycogen metabolism. We demonstrate the presence of an active glycogen metabolism in the neuronal cell lines NSC-34 and N18TG2 and the mobilization of the glycogen stores under hypoxia, oxidative and acidic metabolic stress. The key enzyme in glycogen degradation is glycogen phosphorylase. Neurons express only the brain isoform (GPBB) that is supposed to be activated primarily by the allosteric activator AMP and less by covalent phosphorylation via the cAMP cascade. Our results indicate that neuronal glycogen is not degraded upon hormone action but by factors lowering the energy charge of the cells directly.",
