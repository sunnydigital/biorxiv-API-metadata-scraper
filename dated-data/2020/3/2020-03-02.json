    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells acquired novel organelles during evolution through mechanisms that remain largely obscure. The existence of the unique oil body compartment is a synapomorphy of liverworts that represents lineage-specific acquisition of this organelle during evolution, although its origin, biogenesis, and physiological function are yet unknown. We found that two Syntaxin 1 paralogs in the liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha, are distinctly targeted to forming cell plates and the oil body, suggesting these structures share some developmental similarity. Oil body formation is under the regulation of an ERF/AP2-type transcription factor and loss of the oil body increased M. polymorpha herbivory. These findings highlight a common strategy for the acquisition of organelles with distinct functions in plants, via periodical switching in secretion direction depending on cellular phase transition.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome conformation capture (3C) provides an adaptable tool for studying diverse biological questions. Current 3C methods provide either low-resolution interaction profiles across the entire genome, or high-resolution interaction profiles at up to several hundred loci. All 3C methods are affected to varying degrees by inefficiency, bias and noise. As such, generation of reproducible high-resolution interaction profiles has not been achieved at scale. To overcome this barrier, we systematically tested and improved upon current methods. We show that isolation of 3C libraries from intact nuclei, as well as shortening and titration of enrichment oligonucleotides used in high-resolution methods reduces noise and increases on-target sequencing. We combined these technical modifications into a new method Nuclear-Titrated (NuTi) Capture-C, which provides a >3-fold increase in informative sequencing content over current Capture-C protocols. Using NuTi Capture-C we target 8,061 promoters in triplicate, demonstrating that this method generates reproducible high-resolution genome-wide 3C interaction profiles at scale.",

    "abstract": "Elephant grass (Pennisetum purpureum Schum., AABB, 2n=4x=28), which is characterized as robust growth and high biomass, and widely distributed in tropical and subtropical areas globally, is an important forage, biofuels and industrial plant. We sequenced its allopolyploid genome and assembled 2.07 Gb (96.88%) into A and B sub-genomes of 14 chromosomes with scaffold N50 of 8.47 Mb. A total of 38,453 and 36,981 genes were annotated in A and B sub-genomes, respectively. A phylogenetic analysis with species in Pennisetum identified that the speciation of the allotetraploid occurred approximately 15 MYA after the divergence between S.italica and P. glaucum. Double whole-genome duplication (WGD) and polyploidization events resulted in large scale gene expansion, especially in the key steps of growth and biomass accumulation. Integrated transcriptome profiling revealed the functional differentiation between sub-genomes; A sub-genome contributed more to plant growth, development and photosynthesis whereas B sub-genome primarily offered functions of effective transportation and resistance to stimulation. The results uncovered enhanced cellulose and lignin biosynthesis pathways with 645 and 666 genes expanded in A and B sub-genomes, respectively. Our findings provided deep insights into the speciation and genetic basis of fast growth and high biomass accumulation in the species. The genetic, genomic, and transcriptomic resources generated in this study will pave the way for further domestication and selection of these economical species and making them more adaptive to industrial utilization.",

    "abstract": "Microbial ecology research is currently driven by the continuously decreasing cost of DNA sequencing and the improving accuracy of data analysis methods. One such analysis method is phylogenetic placement, which establishes the phylogenetic identity of the anonymous environmental sequences in a sample by means of a given phylogenetic reference tree. However, assessing the diversity of a sample remains challenging, as traditional methods do not scale well with the increasing data volumes and/or do not leverage the phylogenetic placement information.\n\nHere, we present SCRAPP, a highly parallel and scalable tool that uses a molecular species delimitation algorithm to quantify the diversity distribution over the reference phylogeny for a given phylogenetic placement of the sample. SCRAPP employs a novel approach to cluster phylogenetic placements, called placement space clustering, to efficiently perform dimensionality reduction, so as to scale on large data volumes. Furthermore, it utilizes the phylogeny-aware molecular species delimitation method mPTP to quantify diversity.\n\nWe evaluated SCRAPP using both, simulated and empirical datasets. We use simulated data to verify our approach. Tests on an empirical dataset show that SCRAPP-derived metrics can classify samples by their diversity-correlated features equally well or better than existing, commonly used approaches.\n\nSCRAPP is available at https://github.com/pbdas/scrapp",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) has become one of the most important approach for structural biology. However, barriers are still there for an increase successful rate, a better resolution and improved efficiency from sample preparation, data collection to image processing. CryoEM sample preparation is one of the bottlenecks with many efforts made recently, including the optimization of supporting substrate (e.g. ultra-thin carbon, graphene, pure gold, 2d crystal of streptavidin, and affinity modification), which was aimed to solve air-water interface problem, or reduce beam induced motion (BIM), or change particle distribution in the grid hole. Here, we report another effort of developing a new supporting substrate, the amorphous nickel-titanium alloy (ANTA) film, for cryoEM sample preparation. Our investigations showed advantages of ANTA film in comparison with conventional carbon film, including superior electron conductivity and trace non-specific interaction with protein. These advantages yield less BIM and significantly improved particle distribution during cryoEM experiment of human apo-ferritn, thus resulting an improved reconstruction resolution from a reduced number of micrographs and particles. Unlike the pure gold film, the usage of the ANTA film is just same with the carbon film, compatible to conventional automatic cryoEM data collection procedure.",

    "abstract": "In the analysis of genomic sequence data, so-called \"alignment free\" approaches are often selected for their relative speed compared to alignment-based approaches, especially in the application of distance comparisons and taxonomic classification1,2,3,4. These methods are typically reliant on excising K-length substrings of the input sequence, called K-mers5. In the context of machine learning, K-mer based feature vectors have been used in applications ranging from amplicon sequencing classification to predictive modeling for antimicrobial resistance genes6,7,8. This can be seen as an analogy of the \"bag-of-words\" model successfully employed in natural language processing and computer vision for document and image classification9,10. Feature extraction techniques from natural language processing have previously been analogized to genomics data11; however, the \"bag-of-words\" approach is brittle in the RNA virus space due to the high intersequence variance and the exact matching requirement of K-mers. To reconcile the simplicity of \"bag-of-words\" methods with the complications presented by the intrinsic variance of RNA virus space, a method to resolve the fragility of extracted K-mers in a way that faithfully reflects an underlying biological phenomenon was devised. Our algorithm, Vorpal, allows the construction of interpretable linear models with clustered, representative  degenerate K-mers as the input vector and, through regularization, sparse predictors of binary phenotypes as the output. Here, we demonstrate the utility of Vorpal by identifying nucleotide-level genomic motif predictors for binary phenotypes in three separate RNA virus clades; human pathogen vs. non-human pathogen in Orthocoronavirinae, hemorrhagic fever causing vs. non-hemorrhagic fever causing in Ebolavirus, and human-host vs. non-human host in Influenza A. The capacity of this approach for in silico identification of hypotheses which can be validated by direct experimentation, as well as identification of genomic targets for preemptive biosurveillance of emerging viruses, is discussed.

    "abstract": "Traditional approaches to guiding decisions about harvesting bushmeat often employ single-species population dynamic models, which require species- and location-specific data, are missing ecological processes such as multi-trophic interactions, cannot represent multi-species harvesting, and cannot predict the broader ecosystem impacts of harvesting. In order to explore an alternative approach to devising sustainable harvesting strategies, we employ the Madingley General Ecosystem Model, which can simulate ecosystem dynamics in response to multi-species harvesting given nothing other than location-specific climate data. We used the model to examine yield, extinctions, and broader ecosystem impacts, for a range of harvesting intensities of duiker-sized ectothermic herbivores. Duiker antelope (such as Cephalophus callipygus and Cephalophus dorsalis) are the most heavily hunted species in sub-Saharan Africa, contributing 34%-95% of all bushmeat in the Congo Basin. Across a range of harvesting rates, the Madingley model gave estimates for optimal harvesting rate, and extinction rate, that were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the estimates from single-species Beverton-Holt model. Predicted yields were somewhat greater (around 5 times, on average) for the Madingley model, which would be expected given that the Madingley simulates multi-species harvesting from an initially pristine ecosystem. This match increased the degree of confidence with which we could examine other predictions from the ecosystem model, as follows. At medium and high levels of harvesting of duiker-sized herbivores, there were statistically significant, but moderate, reductions in the densities of the targeted functional group; increases in small-bodied herbivores; decreases in large-bodied carnivores; and minimal ecosystem-level impacts overall. The results suggest that general ecosystem models such as the Madingley model could be used more widely to help estimate sustainable harvesting rates, bushmeat yields and broader ecosystem impacts across different locations and target species.",

The inferred genotypes can then be used to perform genomic selection. Previous methods which used high-throughput phenotype data to increase the accuracy of selection assumed that the high-throughput phenotypes correlate with selection targets. When this is not the case, we show that the high-throughput phenotypes can be used to determine which haplotypes an individual inherited from their parents, and thereby infer the individuals genotypes. We tested this method in two simulations. In the first simulation, we explored, how the accuracy of the inferred genotypes depended on the high-throughput phenotypes used and the genome of the species analysed. In the second simulation we explored whether using this method could increase genetic gain a plant breeding program by enabling genomic selection on non-genotyped individuals. In the first simulation, we found that genotype accuracy was higher if more high-throughput phenotypes were used and if those phenotypes had higher heritability. We also found that genotype accuracy decreased with an increasing size of the species genome. In the second simulation, we found that the inferred genotypes could be used to enable genomic selection on non-genotyped individuals and increase genetic gain compared to random selection, or in some scenarios phenotypic selection. This method presents a novel way for using high-throughput phenotype data in breeding programs. As the quality of high-throughput phenotypes increases and the cost decreases, this method may enable the use of genomic selection on large numbers of non-genotyped individuals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDiploid genome assembly is typically impeded by heterozygosity, as it introduces errors when haplotypes are collapsed into a consensus sequence. Trio binning offers an innovative solution which exploits heterozygosity for assembly. Short, parental reads are used to assign parental origin to long reads from their F1 offspring before assembly, enabling complete haplotype resolution. Trio binning could therefore provide an effective strategy for assembling highly heterozygous genomes which are traditionally problematic, such as insect genomes. This includes the wood tiger moth (Arctia plantaginis), which is an evolutionary study system for warning colour polymorphism.\n\nFindingsWe produced a high-quality, haplotype-resolved assembly for Arctia plantaginis through trio binning. We sequenced a same-species family (F1 heterozygosity [~]1.9%) and used parental Illumina reads to bin 99.98% of offspring Pacific Biosciences reads by parental origin, before assembling each haplotype separately and scaffolding with 10X linked-reads. Both assemblies are highly contiguous (mean scaffold N50: 8.2Mb) and complete (mean BUSCO completeness: 97.3%), with complete annotations and 31 chromosomes identified through karyotyping. We employed the assembly to analyse genome-wide population structure and relationships between 40 wild resequenced individuals from five populations across Europe, revealing the Georgian population as the most genetically differentiated with the lowest genetic diversity.\n\nConclusionsWe present the first invertebrate genome to be assembled via trio binning. This assembly is one of the highest quality genomes available for Lepidoptera, supporting trio binning as a potent strategy for assembling highly heterozygous genomes. Using this assembly, we provide genomic insights into geographic population structure of Arctia plantaginis.",

This hemolysis results in an increased level of free heme that has been implicated in the inflammatory activation of monocytes, macrophages, and endothelium. Here, we show that extracellular heme engages the human inflammatory caspases, caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-5, resulting in the release of IL-1{beta}. Heme-induced IL-1{beta} release was further increased in macrophages from patients with sickle cell disease. In human primary macrophages, heme activated caspase-1 in an inflammasome-dependent manner, but heme-induced activation of caspase-4 and caspase-5 was independent of canonical inflammasomes. Furthermore, we show that both caspase-4, and caspase-5 are essential for heme-induced IL-1{beta} release, while caspase-4 is the primary contributor to heme-induced cell death. Together, we have identified that extracellular heme acts as a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that can engage canonical and non-canonical inflammasome activation as a key mediator of inflammation in macrophages.\n\nFootnotesFunding for the project includes NIH/NIDDK T32DK060445 (BEB, BAR), NIH/NIDDK F32DK121479 (BEB), NIH/NIGMS R01GM121389 (LBH), NIH/NHLBI R01HL114567 (JDB, GMV), NIH/NHLBI R01-HL136415 (JMF), and CPRIT-RP180672, NIHCA125123 and NIHRR024574 (Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core at Baylor College of Medicine)\n\nKey PointsO_LIHeme induces oligomerization of caspase-1, caspase-4, and caspase-5.\nC_LIO_LIHeme-induced IL-1{beta} release requires both caspase-4 and caspase-5.\nC_LIO_LICaspase-4 alone contributes to heme-induced cell death.\nC_LI",

How this limited number of macrophages provides protection is unclear, as numerous pathogens block cell-intrinsic immune responses. The intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila inhibits host translation, thereby impairing the ability of infected macrophages to produce critical cytokines. Nevertheless, infected macrophages induce an IL-1-dependent inflammatory response by recruited myeloid cells that controls infection. Here, we show that collaboration with the alveolar epithelium is critical, in that IL-1 instructs the alveolar epithelium to produce GM-CSF. Intriguingly, GM-CSF drives maximal cytokine production in bystander myeloid cells by enhancing PRR-induced glycolysis. Our findings reveal that alveolar macrophages engage alveolar epithelial signals to metabolically reprogram myeloid cells and amplify antibacterial inflammation.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe alveolar epithelium is a central signal relay between infected and bystander myeloid cells that orchestrates antibacterial defense.",

Msr1 knockout mice had elevated viral loads and increased susceptibility to CHIKV arthritis along with a normal type I IFN response. Induction of LC3 lipidation by CHIKV, a marker of autophagy, was reduced in Msr1-/- cells. Mechanistically, MSR1 interacted with ATG12 through its cytoplasmic tail and this interaction was enhanced by CHIKV nsP1 protein. MSR1 repressed CHIKV replication through ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L1 and this was dependent on the FIP200-and-WIPI2-binding domain, but not the WD40 domain of ATG16L1. Our results elucidate an antiviral role for MSR1 involving the autophagic function of ATG5-ATG12-ATG16L1.",

    "abstract": "Simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are found ubiquitously in almost all genome, and their formation mechanism is ambiguous yet. Here, the SSRs were analyzed in 55 randomly selected segments of genomes from a fairly wide range of species, with introducing more open standard for extensively mining repeats. A high percentage of repeats were discovered in these segments, which is inconsistent with the current theory suggested that repeats tend to disappear over long-term evolution. Therefore, a mechanism is most probably responsible for continually producing repeats during replication to balance continuous repeat disappearance, which may makes the replicating process relatively semi-conservative. To improve the current straight-line slippage model, we proposed a folded slippage model involving the geometric space of nucleotides and hydrogen bond stability to explain the high-percent SSR occurrence, which can describe SSR expansion and contraction more reasonably. And analysis of external forces in the folding template strands suggested that the microsatellites tend to expand than contract. Our research may provide implements for contributions of microsatellites to genome evolution and complement semi-conservative replication.",

    "abstract": "Exercise exerts a beneficial effect on the major pathological and clinical symptoms associated with Alzheimer s disease in humans and mouse models of the disease. While numerous mechanisms for such benefits from exercise have been proposed, a clear understanding of the causal links remains elusive. Recent studies also suggest that cerebral blood flow in the brain of both Alzheimer s patients and mouse models of the disease is decreased and that the cognitive symptoms can be improved when blood flow is restored. We therefore hypothesized that the mitigating effect of exercise on the development and progression of Alzheimer s disease may be mediated through an increase in the otherwise reduced brain blood flow. To test this idea, we examined the impact of three months of voluntary wheel running in [~]1-year-old APP/PS1 mice on short-term memory function, brain inflammation, amyloid deposition, and cerebral blood flow. Our findings that exercise led to improved memory function, a trend toward reduced brain inflammation, markedly increased neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, and no changes in amyloid-beta deposits are consistent with other reports on the impact of exercise on the progression of Alzheimer s related symptoms in mouse models. Notably, we did not observe any impact of wheel running on overall cortical blood flow nor on the incidence of non-flowing capillaries, a mechanism we recently identified as one contributing factor to cerebral blood flow deficits in mouse models of Alzheimer s disease. Overall, our results replicate previous findings that exercise is able to ameliorate certain aspects of Alzheimer s disease pathology, but show that this benefit does not appear to act through increases in cerebral blood flow.",

    "abstract": "The leading FDA-approved drugs for epigenetic cancer therapy are small molecule compounds that activate silenced tumor suppressors by inhibiting enzymes that generate aberrant repressive chromatin. Although promising, this approach is limited because chromatin-modifying enzymes often target non-chromatin proteins and can serve dual functions as gene repressors and activators. Previously, we have demonstrated that a transgenically expressed synthetic polycomb-derived transcription factor (PcTF) could activate genes in silenced chromatin via specific interactions with histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Efficient non-viral intracellular delivery remains a challenge for protein-based biologics. Herein, we report the delivery of cell-penetrating PcTF (CP-PcTF) to cultured cells. We expressed and purified recombinant PcTF that was fused in frame with a nuclear localization signal and a cell penetrating peptide tag (TAT). We demonstrated rapid and efficient uptake of soluble CP-PcTF by osteosarcoma U-2 OS cells grown in 2-D monolayers and 3-D spheroids. However, CP-PcTF had a modest effect on gene expression and cell proliferation compared to transgenically-expressed PcTF from our previous work. Overall, these results suggest that TAT is a very effective delivery vehicle for the recombinant transcriptional regulator PcTF, and that further technical development is needed to deliver functional PcTF into cell nuclei.",

    "abstract": "Oxygenic photosynthesis starts with the oxidation of water to O2, a light-driven reaction catalysed by photosystem II. Cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes capable of water oxidation and therefore, it is assumed that relative to the origin of life and bioenergetics, the origin of oxygenic photosynthesis is a late innovation. However, when exactly water oxidation originated remains an unanswered question. Here we use relaxed molecular clocks to compare one of the two ancestral core duplications that are unique to water-oxidizing photosystem II, that leading to CP43 and CP47, with some of the oldest well-described events in the history of life. Namely, the duplication leading to the Alpha and Beta subunits of the catalytic head of ATP synthase, and the divergence of archaeal and bacterial RNA polymerases and ribosomes. We also compare it with more recent events such as the duplication of cyanobacteria-specific FtsH metalloprotease subunits, of CP43 variants used in a variety of photoacclimation responses, and the speciation events leading to Margulisbacteria, Sericytochromatia, Vampirovibrionia, and other clades containing anoxygenic phototrophs. We demonstrate that the ancestral core duplication of photosystem II exhibits patterns in the rates of protein evolution through geological time that are nearly identical to those of the ATP synthase, RNA polymerase, or the ribosome. Furthermore, we use ancestral sequence reconstruction in combination with comparative structural biology of photosystem subunits, to provide additional evidence supporting the premise that water oxidation had originated before the ancestral core duplications. Our work suggests that photosynthetic water oxidation originated closer to the origin of life and bioenergetics than can be documented based on species trees alone.",

Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulphate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1.

    "abstract": "Animals exhibit different behavioral responses to the same sensory cue depending on their state at a given moment in time. How and where in the brain are sensory inputs combined with internal state information to select an appropriate behavior? Here we investigate how food deprivation affects olfactory behavior in Drosophila larvae. We find that certain odors reliably repel well-fed animals but attract food-deprived animals. We show that feeding state flexibly alters neural processing in the first olfactory center, the antennal lobe. Food deprivation differentially modulates two separate output pathways that are required for opposing behavioral responses. Uniglomerular projection neurons mediate odor attraction and show elevated odor-evoked activity in the food-deprived state. A multiglomerular projection neuron mediates odor aversion and receives odor-evoked inhibition in the food-deprived state. The switch between these two pathways is regulated by the lone serotonergic neuron in the antennal lobe, CSD. Our findings demonstrate how flexible behaviors can arise from state-dependent circuit dynamics in an early sensory processing center.",

Many of these proteins are also targets of Fragile-X mental retardation protein (FMRP), the inactivation of which is the leading monogenic cause of autism. Accordingly, the expression of a subset of these KCC2-binding partners was decreased in Fmr1 knockout mice. Fmr1 knockout compromised KCC2 phosphorylation, a key regulatory mechanism for transporter activity and the postnatal development of GABAergic inhibition.

    "abstract": "Background and purposeActivation of astrocytes contributes to synaptic remodeling, tissue repair and neuronal survival following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, the mechanisms by which these cells interact to infiltrated inflammatory cells to rewire neuronal networks and repair brain functions remain poorly understood. Here, we explored how TLR4-induced astrocyte activation modified synapses and cerebrovascular integrity following TBI.\n\nExperimental approachWe used pharmacological and genetic approaches to determine how functional astrocyte alterations induced by activation of TLR4-pathway in inflammatory cells regulate synapses and neurovascular unit after TBI. For that, we used calcium imaging, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity assessment and molecular and behavioral tools.\n\nKey resultsShortly after a TBI there is a recruitment of excitable and reactive astrocytes mediated by TLR4-pathway activation with detrimental effects on PSD-95/VGlut1 synaptic puncta, BBB integrity and neurological outcome. Pharmacological blockage of the TLR4-pathway with TAK242 partially reverted many of the observed effects. Synapses and BBB recovery after TAK242 administration were not observed in IP3R2-/- mice, indicating that effects of TLR4-inhibition depend on the subsequent astrocyte activation. In addition, TBI increased the astrocytic-protein thrombospondin-1 necessary to induce a synaptic recovery in a sub-acute phase.\n\nConclusions and implicationsOur data demonstrate that TLR4-mediated signaling, most probably though microglia and/or infiltrated monocyte-astrocyte communication, plays a crucial role in the TBI pathophysiology and that its inhibition prevents synaptic loss and BBB damage accelerating tissue recovery/repair, which might represent a therapeutic potential in CNS injuries and disorders.\n\nDeclaration of transparency and scientific rigourThis Declaration acknowledges that this paper adheres to the principles for transparent reporting and scientific rigour of preclinical research as stated in the BJP guidelines for Design & Analysis, Immunoblotting and Immunochemistry, and Animal Experimentation, and as recommended by funding agencies, publishers and other organisations engaged with supporting research.\n\nBullet point summaryWhat is already known: O_LIAstrocytes and microglia participate in the early cerebral and synaptic response after traumatic brain injury.\nC_LIO_LITLR4 antagonism exerts neuroprotection in acute brain injuries.\nC_LI\n\nWhat this study adds: O_LIAcute astrocyte activation contributes to synaptic loss and BBB breakdown in the acute phase of TBI, and synaptic remodeling in the sub-acute phase.\nC_LIO_LIAstrocyte activation is mediated by microglia/infiltrating-monocytes activation through TLR4 receptors.\nC_LI\n\nClinical significance: O_LIInhibition of astrocyte activation through TLR4 antagonism could be a promising option for TBI treatment.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The integration of neurons into networks relies on the formation of dendritic spines. These specialized structures arise from dynamic filopodia-like spiny protrusions. Recently, it was discovered that cortical neurons lacking the channel protein Pannexin 1 (Panx1) exhibited larger and more complicated neuronal networks, as well as, higher dendritic spine densities. Here, we expanded on those findings to investigate whether the increase in dendritic spine density associated with lack of Panx1 was due to differences in the rates of spine dynamics. Using a fluorescent membrane tag (mCherry-CD9-10) to visualize spiny protrusions in developing neurons (at 10 days-in-vitro, DIV10) we confirmed that lack of Panx1 leads to higher spiny protrusion density while transient transfection of Panx1 leads to decreased spiny protrusion density. To quantify the impact of Panx1 expression on spiny protrusion formation, elimination, and motility, we used live cell imaging in DIV10 neurons (1 frame every 5 seconds for 10 minutes). We discovered, that at DIV10, lack of Panx1 KO stabilized spiny protrusions. Notably, re-expression of Panx1 in Panx1 knockout neurons resulted in a significant increase in spiny protrusion motility and turnover. In summary, these new data revealed that Panx1 regulates the development of dendritic spines by controlling protrusion dynamics.\n\nSignificance statementCells in the brain form intricate and specialized networks - neuronal networks - in charge of processing sensations, executing movement commands, and storing memories. To do this, brain cells extend microscopic protrusions - spiny protrusions - which are highly dynamic and survey the local environment to contact other cells. Those contact sites are known as synapses and undergo further stabilization and maturation establishing the function and efficiency of neuronal networks. Our work shows that removal of Panx1 increases the stability and decreases the turnover of spiny protrusion on young neurons.",

    "abstract": "Social experiences greatly define successive social behavior. Lack of such experiences, especially during critical phases of development, can severely impede the ability to behave adequately in social contexts. To date it is not well characterized how early-life social isolation leads to social deficits and impacts development. In many model species, it is challenging to fully control social experiences, because they depend on parental care. Moreover, complex social behaviors involve multiple sensory modalities, contexts, and actions. Hence, when studying social isolation effects, it is particularly important to parse apart social deficits from general developmental effects, such as abnormal motor learning. Here, we characterized how social experiences during early development of zebrafish larvae modulate their social behavior, at one week of age, when social avoidance reactions can be measured as discrete swim events. We show that raising larvae in social isolation leads to enhanced social avoidance, in terms of reaction distance and reaction strength. Specifically, larvae raised in isolation use a high-acceleration escape swim bout, the short latency C-start, more frequently during social interactions. These behavioral differences are absent in non-social contexts. By ablating the lateral line and presenting the fish with local water vibrations, we show that lateral line inputs are both necessary and sufficient to drive enhanced social avoidance reactions. Taken together, our results show that social experience during development is a critical factor in shaping mechanosensory avoidance reactions in larval zebrafish.\n\nHighlightsO_LILarval zebrafish raised in isolation show enhanced social avoidance reactions\nC_LIO_LIEnhanced avoidance is composed of increased avoidance distances and usage of high acceleration escape swims\nC_LIO_LIThe lateral line sensory organ is necessary and sufficient for the increased usage of high acceleration escape swims\nC_LI",

MLIs are classically divided into two types. However, their morphological heterogeneity suggests an alternate model of one continuously varying population. Through clustering and trajectory inference of 811 MLI reconstructions at maturity and during development, we show that MLIs divide into two discrete classes but also present significant within-class heterogeneity. Pseudotime trajectory mapping uncovered the emergence of distinct phenotypes during migration and axonogenesis, well before neurons reach their final positions. Our study illustrates the utility of quantitative single-cell methods to morphology for defining the diversification of neuronal subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Previously we showed that cryo fixation of brain tissue gave a truer representation of brain ultrastructure in comparison with a standard chemical fixation method (Korogod et al 2005). Extracellular space matched physiological measurements, there were larger numbers of docked vesicles and less glial coverage of synapses and blood capillaries. Here, using the same preservation approaches we compared the morphology of dendritic spines. We show that the length of the spine and the volume of its head is unchanged, however, the spine neck width is thinner by more than 30 % after cryo fixation. In addition, the weak correlation between spine neck width and head volume seen after chemical fixation was not present in cryo-fixed spines. Our data suggest that spine neck geometry is independent of the spine head volume, with cryo fixation showing enhanced spine head compartmentalization and a higher predicted electrical resistance between spine head and parent dendrite.",

    "abstract": "Shade-avoiding plants including Arabidopsis thaliana display a number of growth responses elicited by shade cues including elongation of stem-like structures and repositioning of leaves. Shade also promotes phototropism of de-etiolated seedlings through repression of phytochrome B (phyB) presumably to enhance capture of unfiltered sunlight. Light cues indicative of shade include a reduction in the blue and red portions of the solar spectrum and a low red to far-red ratio. Here we show that in Arabidopsis seedlings both low blue and a low red to far-red ratio are required to rapidly enhance phototropism. However, prolonged low blue treatments through reduced cryptochrome 1 (cry1) activation are sufficient to promote phototropism. The enhanced phototropic response of cry1 mutants in the lab and in response to natural canopies depends on PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs). In favorable light conditions, cry1 limits the expression of PIF4 while in low blue light PIF4 expression increases, which contributes to phototropic enhancement. The analysis of a quantitative DII auxin reporter indicates that low blue light leads to enhanced auxin levels in the hypocotyl and, upon phototropic stimulation, a steeper auxin gradient across the hypocotyl. We conclude that phototropic enhancement by canopy shade results from the combined activities of phytochrome B and cry1 that converge on PIF regulation.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYThe persistent depletion of blue light in natural canopy shade relieves the inhibitory effect of cryptochrome 1 on PIF4, enhancing phototropism in de-etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings.\n\nFinancial supportThis work was supported by the University of Lausanne and a grant from the Swiss National Science foundation (n{degrees} 310030B_179558 to C.F.); Human Frontier Science Program organization (HFSP) Grant RPG0054-2013, ANR-12-BSV6-0005 grant (AuxiFlo) to T.V.; The University of Buenos Aires (Grant 20020100100437 to J.

    "abstract": "DNA polymerase pol {zeta} is regarded as a specialized DNA polymerase for bypass of DNA lesions. In mammalian cells, pol {zeta} also contributes to genomic stability during normal DNA replication. Disruption of Rev3l (the catalytic subunit of pol {zeta}) is toxic to cells and mice, with increased constitutive chromosome damage, including micronuclei. As the cellular manifestations of this genomic stress have remained unexplored, we measured genome-wide transcriptional changes by RNA-seq in pol {zeta}-defective cells. Expression of 1117 transcripts was altered by 4-fold or more in Rev3l knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), with a pattern showing an induction of an innate immune response. We validated the increased expression of known interferon-stimulated genes (ISG) at the mRNA and protein levels. We found that the cGAS-STING axis, which senses cytosolic DNA, drives ISG expression in Rev3l knockout MEFs. These results reveal a new genome protective function of pol {zeta} and indicate that inhibition of pol {zeta} may be therapeutically useful by simultaneously increasing sensitivity to genotoxins and inducing a cytotoxic innate immune response.",

    "abstract": "Humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) social structure is more complex than previously thought. Because of the fluid \"fission-fusion\" nature of their relationships: individuals foraging, traveling, and socializing with a number of animals, where associations form and are broken numerous times, little has been confirmed about their long-term associations. Humpback whales of the North Pacific Ocean migrate annually between tropical breeding areas to northern latitudes where they congregate and feed. The purpose of this study was to explore the social and feeding habits of the summer population of humpback whales returning to Prince William Sound (PWS) in the south central coast of Alaska. Fluke photographs of pigmentation patterns were used to document individual whales between the years 1983 and 2009 to determine, population characteristics, reproductive rates, long-term associations, feeding habits and spatial partitioning. During the 27 year study period there were 3,017 encounters with 405 unique whales. Forty of these whales (9.88%) had long sighting histories, showing strong site fidelity. Association indices for all pairs of whales were calculated. Long-lasting associations were found between thirty-two of the forty whales. Two distinct groups were determined by the highest association coefficients. Although the overall ranges of the two groups overlapped, they did not often mingle and offspring did not join their maternal group. All but two females had enduring bonds with at least one male. Associate males were sometimes found at a distance from others of their \"clan\" and would rejoin periodically. Two whales from one of these clans were found together in Hawaiian waters, a male escorting a female with a newborn calf, suggesting these long lasting associations endure through migration and into the southern breeding areas. Optimal observation conditions of a small population of humpback whales in sheltered waters allowed the discovery of two social groups enduring almost three decades.",

    "abstract": "Echolocating bats locate a target by echolocation and their performance is related to the shape of the binaural conformation in bats. In this study, we developed an artificial sonar system based on the vertical sound localization characteristics of the brown long-eared bat (Plecotus auritus). First, using the finite element method, we found that the beam of the first side lobe formed by a pinna constructed according to that in the brown long-eared bat shifted in an almost linear manner in the vertical direction as the frequency changed from 30 kHz to 60 kHz. We established a model of the relationship between the time-frequency features of the echo emitted by brown long-eared bats and the spatial direction by using the pre-trained neural network. We also developed a majority vote-based method called sliding window cumulative peak estimation (SWCPE) to optimize the outputs from the neural network. In addition, an L-shaped pinna structure was designed to simultaneously estimate the azimuth and elevation. Our field experiments indicated that the binaural conformation and relative binaural orientation both played vital roles in spatial target localization by these bats. Accurate echolocation can be achieved using a simple binaural sonar device even without binaural time difference information.",

    "abstract": "Long-distance movements of sharks within and between islands pose substantial challenges for resource managers working with highly migratory species. When no-take zones do not cover the critical areas that sharks use as part of their lifecycle, exposure to fishing activities can be significant. Shark movements between the Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) of the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) have been studied for several years, however little is known about the strength of connectivity between these islands. We analyzed the extensive MigraMar ultrasonic telemetry dataset to assess how Galapagos sharks (Carcharhinus galapagensis) and silky sharks (Carcharhinus falciformis) use different islands as stepping-stones during their migrations within the Revillagigedo National Park and other ETP islands. Of the 66 sharks monitored, 63.5% moved within the same island, 25.4% between two islands or more and only 10.1% across different MPAs. A C. falciformis tagged in Roca Partida Island, Revillagigedo, travelled to Clipperton Atoll and another one tagged in Darwin Island travelled to the atoll on two different years. The largest movement of C. galapagensis was accomplished by a shark tagged at Socorro Island, Revillagigedo, later detected at Clipperton and finally recorded in Darwin Island, Galapagos. This last path was in fact, one of the longest movements ever recorded for the species. Although long-distance dispersion was not common, our results highlight the need for co-operation between different countries to ensure adequate protection for sharks in the form of swimways and other conservation tools in the ETP.",

    "abstract": "Riboswitch, a part of mRNA (50-250nt in length), has two main classes: aptamer and expression platform. One of the main challenges raised during the classification of riboswitch is imbalanced data. That is a circumstance in which the records of a dataset of one group are very small compared to the others. Such circumstances lead classifier to ignore minority group and emphasize on majority class, that resulting with a skewed classification. We considered sixteen riboswitch families, to be in accord with recent riboswitch classification work, that contain imbalanced dataset ranging from 4,826 instances (RF00174) to 39 (RF01051) instances. The dataset was divided into training and test set using new developed pipeline. From 5460 k-mers, 156 features were produced calculated based on CfsSubsetEval and BestFirst. Statistically tested result was significantly difference between balanced and imbalanced dataset (p < 0.05). Besides, each algorithm also showed a significant difference in sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and macro F-score when used in both groups (p < 0.05). Several k-mers clustered from heat map were discovered to have biological functions and motifs at the different positions like interior loops, terminal loops and helices. They were validated to have a biological function and some are riboswitch motifs. The analysis has discovered the importance of solving the challenges of majority bias analysis and overfitting. Presented results were generalized evaluation of both balanced and imbalanced models, which implies their ability of classifying novel riboswitches. The scientific community can use python source code at https://github.com/Seasonsling/riboswitch, which can contribute to the process of developing software packages.\n\nAuthor SummaryMachine learning application has been used in many ways in bioinformatics and computational biology. Its use in riboswitch classification is still limited and existing attempt showed challenges due to imbalanced dataset. Algorithms classify dataset with majority and minority group, but they tend to ignore minority group and emphasize on majority class, consequential return a skewed classification We used new pipeline including SMOTE for balancing datasets that showed better classified riboswitch as well as improved performance of algorithms selected. Statistically significant difference observed between balanced and imbalanced in sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and F-score, this proved balanced dataset better for classification of riboswitch. Biological functions and motif search of k-mers in riboswitch families revealed their presence in interior loops, terminal loops and helices, some of the k-mers were reported to be riboswitch motifs of aptamer domains and critical for metabolite binding. The pipeline can be used in machine learning and deep learning study in other domains of bioinformatics and computational biology suffering from imbalanced dataset. Finally, scientific community can use python source code, the work done and flow to develop packages.",

    "abstract": "With the ever-increasing quality and quantity of imaging data in biomedical research comes the demand for computational methodologies that enable efficient and reliable automated extraction of the quantitative information contained within these images. One of the challenges in providing such methodology is the need for tailoring algorithms to the specifics of the data, limiting their areas of application. Here we present a broadly applicable approach to quantification and classification of complex shapes and patterns in biological or other multi-component formations. This approach integrates the mapping of all shape boundaries within an image onto a global information-rich graph and machine learning on the multidimensional measures of the graph. We demonstrated the power of this method by (1) extracting subtle structural differences from visually indistinguishable images in our phenotype rescue experiments using the endothelial tube formations assay, (2) training the algorithm to identify biophysical parameters underlying the formation of different multicellular networks in our simulation model of collective cell behavior, and (3) analyzing the response of U2OS cell cultures to a broad array of small molecule perturbations.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn this paper, we present a methodology that is based on mapping an arbitrary set of outlines onto a complete, strictly defined structure, in which every point representing the shape becomes a terminal point of a global graph. Because this mapping preserves the whole complexity of the shape, it allows for extracting the full scope of geometric features of any scale. Importantly, an extensive set of graph-based metrics in each image makes integration with machine learning routines highly efficient even for a small data sets and provide an opportunity to backtrack the subtle morphological features responsible for the automated distinction into image classes. The resulting tool provides efficient, versatile, and robust quantification of complex shapes and patterns in experimental images.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput SNP genotyping has become a precondition to move to higher precision and wider genome coverage genetic analysis of natural and breeding populations of non-model species. We developed a 44,318 annotated SNP catalog for Araucaria angustifolia, a grandiose subtropical conifer tree, one of the only two native Brazilian gymnosperms, critically endangered due to its valuable wood and seeds. Following transcriptome assembly and annotation, SNPs were discovered from RNA-seq and pooled RAD-seq data. From the SNP catalog, an Axiom(R) SNP array with 3,038 validated SNPs was developed and used to provide a comprehensive look at the genetic diversity and structure of 15 populations across the natural range of the species. RNA-seq was a far superior source of SNPs when compared to RAD-seq in terms of conversion rate to polymorphic markers on the array, likely due to the more efficient complexity reduction of the huge conifer genome. By matching microsatellite and SNP data on the same set of A. angustifolia individuals, we show that SNPs reflect more precisely the actual genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity and structure, challenging previous microsatellite-based assessments. Moreover, SNPs corroborated the known major north-south genetic cline, but allowed a more accurate attribution to regional versus among-population differentiation, indicating the potential to select ancestry-informative markers. The availability of a public, user-friendly 3K SNP array for A. angustifolia and a catalog of 44,318 SNPs predicted to provide [~]29,000 informative SNPs across [~]20,000 loci across the genome, will allow tackling still unsettled questions on its evolutionary history, toward a more comprehensive picture of the origin, past dynamics and future trend of the species genetic resources. Additionally, but not less importantly, the SNP array described, unlocks the potential to adopt genomic prediction methods to accelerate the still very timid efforts of systematic tree breeding of A. angustifolia.",

    "abstract": "ER stress occurs in many physiological and pathological conditions. However, how chronic ER stress is alleviated in specific cells in an intact organism is an outstanding question. Here, overexpressing the gap junction protein UNC-9 (Uncoordinated) in C. elegans neurons triggers the Ire1-Xbp1-mediated stress response in an age-dependent and cell-autonomous manner. The p38 MAPK PMK-3 acts upon the phosphorylation of IRE-1 to regulate chronic stress. Overexpressing gap junction protein also activates autophagy and the insulin pathway functions through autophagy, but not the transcription of genes encoding ER chaperones, to counteract the p38-Ire1-Xbp1-mediated stress response. Together, these results reveal an intricate cellular regulatory network in response to chronic stress in a subset of cells in multicellular organism.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe accumulation of unfolded proteins triggers the ER stress response (UPR), which allows cells to fight against fluctuations in protein expression under both physiological and pathological conditions. Severe acute ER stress responses can be induced by drug treatment. However, such intense ER stress rarely occurs ubiquitously in every cell type in vivo. Here, we designed a genetic system in the nematode C. elegans, which allows us to induce ER stress in specific cells, without drug treatment or any other external stimuli, and then to monitor the stress response. Using this system, genetic screens identified that the p38 MAPK directly acts through the IRE-1-XBP-1 branch of the UPR to promote the stress response. Meanwhile, the insulin receptor functions through autophagy activation to counteract the p38-IRE-1-XBP-1 pathway. Together, these results reveal an intricate cellular regulatory network in response to chronic stress in multicellular organism.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin-25 (IL-25) is recognized as the most relevant initiator of protective Th2 responses in intestinal helminth infections. It is well known that IL-25 induces resistance against several species of intestinal helminths, including the trematode Echinostoma caproni. E. caproni has been extensively used as an experimental model to study the factors determining the resistance to intestinal infections. Herein, we assessed the role of IL-25 in the generation of resistance in mice to E. caproni infections. ICR mice are permissive hosts for E. caproni in which chronic infections are developed in relation to the lack of IL-25 production in response to primary infection and the consequent development of a Th1 response. However, pharmacological clearance of the primary infection induces non-specific expression of IL-25 that protects mice to secondary challenge infections in association with Th2 responses. Using this experimental model, we have determined that the role of IL-25 in the polarization of the immune response differs between the primary and secondary memory response. IL-25 is required for the development of a Th2 phenotype in primary E. caproni infections but also promotes the differentiation to Th2 memory cell subsets that enhances type 2 responses in memory responses, even in the absence of IL-25. Despite these events, development of Th2 responses does not induce resistance to infection. Our results suggest that Th2 phenotype does not elicit resistance and IL-25 is responsible for the resistance regardless of the type 2 cytokine activity and STAT6 activation. Alternative activation of macrophages induced by IL-25 could be implicated in the resistance to infection. In view of the critical role of IL-25, we have also investigated the factors determining the production of IL-25 and appears to be related to the alterations in resident microbiota induced by the infection.\n\nAuthors summaryInterleukin-25 (IL-25) plays a major role in resistance against intestinal helminth infections as initiator of protective Th2 responses. However, recent studies have challenged the contribution of this cytokine in both the polarization of the response towards a Th2 phenotype and the parasite rejection. We have used the experimental model Echinostoma caproni-ICR mice to investigate the participation of this cytokine in resistance to intestinal helminths. ICR mice are characterized by their inability to respond with IL-25 production in primary infections with E. caproni, causing susceptibility associated with a Th1 response. However, mice are refractory to infection in presence of IL-25 in relation to a type 2 phenotype. Herein, we show that dynamics of resident microbiota appears to be crucial in IL-25 production. Moreover, IL-25 seems to play a pivotal role in the polarization to Th2 in primary responses, but also appears to participate in the generation of memory mechanisms making unnecessary the participation of IL-25 in memory responses for the development of Th2 milieu. However, resistance to E. caproni infection does not depend on the generation of a Th2 phenotype, but exclusively depends on the presence of IL-25, operating autonomously from the type 2 response in the generation of resistance.",

    "abstract": "The ability to predict and/or identify MHC binding peptides is an essential component of T cell epitope discovery; something that ultimately should benefit the development of vaccines and immunotherapies. In particular, MHC class I (MHC-I) prediction tools have matured to a point where accurate selection of optimal peptide epitopes is possible for virtually all MHC-I allotypes; in comparison, current MHC class II (MHC-II) predictors are less mature. Since MHC-II restricted CD4+ T cells control and orchestrate most immune responses, this shortcoming severely hampers the development of effective immunotherapies. The ability to generate large panels of peptides and subsequently large bodies of peptide-MHC-II interaction data is key to the solution of this problem; a solution that also will support the improvement of bioinformatics predictors, which critically relies on the availability of large amounts of accurate, diverse and representative data. Here, we have used recombinant HLA-DRB1*01:01 and HLA-DRB1*03:01 molecules to interrogate high-density peptide arrays, in casu containing 70,000 random peptides in triplicates. We demonstrate that the binding data acquired contains systematic and interpretable information reflecting the specificity of the HLA-DR molecules investigated. Collectively, with a cost per peptide reduced to a few cents combined with the flexibility of recombinant HLA technology, this poses an attractive strategy to generate vast bodies of MHC-II binding data at an unprecedented speed and for the benefit of generating peptide-MHC-II binding data as well as improving MHC-II prediction tools.",

    "abstract": "Tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV) is a member of Tobamovirus infecting tomato and pepper. Within North America, both the United States and Mexico consider ToBRFV to be a regulated pest. In Canada, the presence of ToBRFV has been reported, but an efficient diagnostic system has not yet been established. Here, we describe the development and assessment of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based assay to detect ToBRFV. The LAMP test was efficient and robust, and results could be obtained within 35 min with an available RNA sample. Amplification was possible when either water bath or oven were used to maintain the temperature at isothermal conditions (65{degrees}C), and results could be read by visual observation of colour change. Detection limit of the LAMP was eight target RNA molecules. Under the experimental conditions tested, LAMP was as sensitive as qPCR and 100 times more sensitive than the currently used rt-PCR. We recommend this sensitive, efficient LAMP protocol to be used for routine lab testing of ToBRFV.",

    "abstract": "The acquisition of goal-directed action requires the encoding of specific action-outcome associations involving plasticity in the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS). We first investigated the relative involvement of the major inputs to the pDMS argued to be involved in this learning-related plasticity, from prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) and from the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Using ex vivo optogenetic stimulation of PL or BLA terminals in pDMS, we found that goal-directed learning potentiated the PL input to direct pathway spiny projection neurons (dSPNs) bilaterally but not to indirect pathway neurons (iSPNs). In contrast, learning-related plasticity was not observed in the direct BLA-pDMS pathway. Using toxicogenetics, we ablated BLA projections to either pDMS or PL and found that only the latter was necessary for goal-directed learning. Importantly, transient inactivation of the BLA during goal-directed learning prevented the PL-pDMS potentiation of dSPNs, establishing that the BLA input to the PL is necessary for the corticostriatal plasticity underlying goal-directed learning.",

    "abstract": "Data-driven parcellations are widely used for exploring the functional organization of the brain, and also for reducing the high dimensionality of fMRI data. Despite the flurry of methods proposed in the literature, functional brain parcellations are not highly reproducible at the level of individual subjects, even with very long acquisitions. Some brain areas are also more difficult to parcellate than others, with association heteromodal cortices being the most challenging. An important limitation of classical parcellations is that they are static, i.e. they neglect dynamic reconfigurations of brain networks. In this paper, we proposed a new method to identify dynamic states of parcellations, which we hypothesized would improve reproducibility over static parcellation approaches. For a series of seed voxels in the brain, we applied a cluster analysis to regroup short (3 minutes) time windows into \"states\" with highly similar seed parcels. We splitted individual time series of the Midnight scan club sample into two independent sets of 2.5 hours (test and retest). We found that average within-state parcellations, called stability maps, were highly reproducible (over .9 test-retest spatial correlation in many instances) and subject specific (fingerprinting accuracy over 70% on average) between test and retest. Consistent with our hypothesis, seeds in heteromodal cortices (posterior and anterior cingulate) showed a richer repertoire of states than unimodal (visual) cortex. Taken together, our results indicate that static functional parcellations are incorrectly averaging well-defined and distinct dynamic states of brain parcellations. This work calls to revisit previous methods based on static parcellations, which includes the majority of published network analyses of fMRI data. Our method may, thus, impact how researchers model the rich interactions between brain networks in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in the cortico-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit might underlie the diversity of symptoms in schizophrenia. However, molecular changes in cerebellar neuronal circuits, part of this network, have not yet been fully determined. Using LC-MS/MS, we screened altered candidates in pooled grey matter of cerebellum from schizophrenia subjects who committed suicide (n=4) and healthy individuals (n=4). Further validation by immunoblotting of three selected candidates was performed in two cohorts comprising schizophrenia (n=20), non-schizophrenia suicide (n=6) and healthy controls (n=21). We found 99 significantly altered proteins, 31 of them previously reported in other brain areas by proteomic studies. Transport function was the most enriched category, while cell communication was the most prevalent function. For validation, we selected the vacuolar proton pump subunit 1 (VPP1), from transport, and two EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, calmodulin and parvalbumin from cell communication. All candidates showed significant changes in schizophrenia (n=7) compared to controls (n=7). VPP1 was altered in the non-schizophrenia suicide group and increased levels of parvalbumin were linked to antipsychotics. Further validation in an independent cohort of non-suicidal chronic schizophrenia subjects (n=13) and non-psychiatric controls (n=14) showed that parvalbumin was increased while calmodulin was decrease in schizophrenia. Our findings provide evidence of an dysregulation of calcium-binding proteins in the cerebellum in schizophrenia, suggesting an impact on normal calcium-dependent synaptic functioning of cerebellar circuits. Our study also links VPP1 to suicide behaviours, suggesting a possible impairment in vesicle neurotransmitter refilling and release in these phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPowerful neural measurement and perturbation tools have positioned mice as an ideal species for probing the neural circuit mechanisms of cognition. Crucial to this success is the ability to motivate animals to perform specific behaviors. One successful strategy is to restrict their water intake, rewarding them with water during a behavioral task. However, water restriction requires rigorous monitoring of animals health and hydration status and can be challenging for some mice.\n\nWe present an alternative that allows mice more control over their water intake: free home-cage access to water, made slightly sour by a small amount of citric acid (CA). In a previous study, rats with free access to CA water readily performed a behavioral task for water rewards, although completing fewer trials than under water restriction (Reinagel, 2018). We here extend this approach to mice and confirm its robustness across multiple laboratories.\n\nMice reduced their intake of CA water while maintaining healthy weights. Continuous home-cage access to CA water only subtly impacted their willingness to perform a decision-making task, in which they were rewarded with sweetened water. When free CA water was used instead of water restriction only on weekends, learning and decision-making behavior were unaffected. CA water is thus a promising alternative to water restriction, allowing animals more control over their water intake without interfering with behavioral performance.\n\nSO_SCPLOWIGNIFICANCEC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWTATEMENTC_SCPLOWHigh-throughput, reliable behavioral training is a key requirement for the use of mice in behavioral and systems neuroscience, but depends crucially on ability to motivate animals to perform specific behaviors. Here, we present an alternative method to commonly used methods of water restriction: free home-cage access to water, made slightly sour by a small amount of citric acid. This non-labor-intensive, low-error option benefits animal health without hindering behavioral training progress. Citric acid water can serve as a reliable and standardized strategy to achieve high quality task behavior, further facilitating the use of mice in high-throughput behavioral studies.",
