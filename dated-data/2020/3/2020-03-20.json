    "abstract": "There are about 38 million people currently living with HIV/AIDS worldwide. Successful treatment with combinational antiretroviral therapies (cART) can eliminate active replicating viruses and prolong lives to nearly normal lifespans. However, the new challenge faced by more than half of those HIV-infected and aging patients is chronic CNS neuroinflammation, which leads to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). While severe and progressive HAND has decreased significantly due to cART, chronic HAND often persists, resulting in high rates of delirium, dementia and depression that could lead to suicide. Indeed, the risk of suicide mortality in HIV-infected persons is significantly higher than in HIV-uninfected counterparts. Nevertheless, the mechanism of neuropathogenesis underlying HAND is not well understood. HAND is typically characterized by HIV-mediated glial neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. Interestingly, the severity of some HAND does not always correlate with the levels of HIV, but rather with glial activation, suggesting other HIV-associated factors, not the whole virus per se, contribute to those HAND. HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) might be one of those viral factors, because Vpr induces neuroinflammation and causes neuronal apoptosis. The objective of this study was to delineate the specific role(s) of Vpr in activation of host neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity, as well as its contribution to HAND.\n\nIn this report, we show correlations between HIV expression and activation of proinflammatory markers (TLR4, TNF, and NF{kappa}B) and the Sur1-Trpm4 channel in astrocytes of HIV-infected postmortem human and transgenic mouse brain tissues. We further show that Vpr alone activate the same set of proinflammatory markers in an astrocytic cell line SNB19. Vpr-induced host cell proinflammatory responses result in apoptotic cell death. Together, our data suggest that HIV-1 Vpr-induced proinflammatory response and apoptotic cell death are mediated through the Sur1-Trpm4 channel in astrocytes.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscience research has illuminated the mechanisms supporting learning from reward feedback, demonstrating a critical role for the striatum and midbrain dopamine system. However, in humans, short-term working memory that is dependent on frontal and parietal cortices can also play an important role, particularly in commonly-used paradigms in which learning is relatively condensed in time. Given the growing use of reward-based learning tasks in translational studies in computational psychiatry, it is important to understand the degree of working memory contributions and whether gradual learning mechanisms can be better isolated. In our experiments, we manipulated the spacing between repetitions along with a post-learning delay preceding a test phase. We found that learning was slower for stimuli repeated after a long delay (spaced-trained) compared to those repeated immediately (massed-trained), likely reflecting the remaining contribution of feedback learning mechanisms when working memory is not available. Brief interruptions of massed learning led to drops in subsequent performance. Further, individual differences in working memory capacity positively correlated with massed learning performance. Critically, after a delay period but not immediately, relative preferences decayed in the massed condition and increased in the spaced condition. Overall, our results provide additional support for a large role of working memory in reward-based learning in temporally condensed designs. We suggest that spacing training within or between sessions is a promising approach to better isolate and understand mechanisms supporting gradual reward-based learning, with particular importance for understanding potential learning dysfunctions in addiction and psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Benzene is a well-known human carcinogen that is one of the major components of air pollution. Sources of benzene in ambient air include cigarette smoke, e-cigarettes vaping and evaporation of benzene containing petrol processes. While carcinogenic effects of benzene exposure have been well studied, less is known about metabolic effects of benzene exposure. We show that chronic exposure to benzene at low levels induces severe metabolic imbalance in a sex-specific manner, which is associated with hypothalamic inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Benzene exposure rapidly activates hypothalamic ER stress and neuroinflammatory responses in male mice, while pharmacological inhibition of ER stress response by inhibiting IRE1-XBP1 pathway significantly alleviates benzene-induced glial inflammatory responses. Additionally, feeding mice with Acarbose, a clinically available anti-diabetes drug, protected against benzene induced central and peripheral metabolic imbalance. Acarbose imitates the slowing of dietary carbohydrate digestion, suggesting that choosing a diet with a low glycemic index might be a potential strategy for reducing the negative metabolic effect of chronic exposure to benzene for smokers or for people living/working in urban environments with high concentrations of exposure to automobile exhausts.",

    "abstract": "Cortical plasticity improves behaviors and helps recover lost functions after injury by adapting neuronal computations. However, the underlying synaptic and circuit mechanisms remain unclear. In mice, we found that trimming all but one whisker enhances sensory responses from the spared whisker in the somatosensory barrel cortex and occludes whisker-mediated long-term potentiation (w-LTP) in vivo. In addition, whisking-dependent behaviors that are initially impaired by single whisker experience (SWE) rapidly recover when associated cortical regions remap. Blocking the surface diffusion of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) suppresses the expression of w-LTP in naive mice with all whiskers intact, demonstrating that physiologically induced LTP in vivo requires AMPARs trafficking. We used this approach to demonstrate that w-LTP is required for SWE-mediated strengthening of synaptic inputs and initiates the recovery of previously learned skills during the early phases of SWE. Taken together, our data reveal that w-LTP mediates cortical remapping and behavioral improvement upon partial sensory deafferentation and demonstrates that restoration of sensory function after peripheral injury can be manipulated.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo assess gaze evoked deformations of the optic nerve head (ONH) in thyroid eye disease (TED), using computational modelling and optical coherence tomography (OCT).\n\nMethodsMultiple finite element models were constructed: One model of a healthy eye, and two models mimicking effects of TED; one with proptosis and another with extraocular tissue stiffening. Two additional hypothetical models had extraocular tissue softening or no extraocular tissue at all. Horizontal eye movements were simulated in these models.\n\nOCT images of the ONH of 10 healthy volunteers and 1 patient with TED were taken in primary gaze. Additional images were recorded in the same subjects performing eye movements in adduction and abduction.\n\nThe resulting ONH deformation in the models and human subjects was measured by recording the  tilt angle (relative antero-posterior deformation of the Bruchs membrane opening). Effective stress was measured in the peripapillary sclera of the models.\n\nResultsIn our computational models the eyes with proptosis and stiffer extraocular tissue had greater gaze-evoked deformations than the healthy eye model, while the models with softer or no extraocular tissue had lesser deformations, in both adduction and abduction. Scleral stress correlated with the tilt angle measurements.\n\nIn healthy subjects, the mean tilt angle was 1.46{degrees} {+/-} 0.25 in adduction and -0.42{degrees} {+/-} 0.12 in abduction. The tilt angle measured in the subject with TED was 5.37{degrees} in adduction and -2.21{degrees} in abduction.\n\nConclusionsComputational modelling and experimental observation suggest that TED can cause increased gaze-evoked deformations of the ONH.",

    "abstract": "Improvement of feed efficiency (FE) is key for sustainability and cost reduction in pig production. Our aim was to characterize the muscle transcriptomic profiles in Danbred Duroc (Duroc) and Danbred Landrace (Landrace), in relation to FE for identifying potential biomarkers. RNA-seq data was analyzed employing differential gene expression methods, gene-gene interaction and network analysis, including pathway and functional analysis. We compared the results with genome regulation in human exercise data. In the differential expression analysis, 13 genes were differentially expressed, including: MRPS11, MTRF1, TRIM63, MGAT4A, KLH30. Based on a novel gene selection method, the divergent count, we performed pathway enrichment analysis. We found 5 significantly enriched pathways related to feed conversion ratio (FCR). These pathways were mainly mitochondrial, and summarized in the mitochondrial translation elongation (MTR) pathway. In the gene interaction analysis, highlights include the mitochondrial genes: PPIF, MRPL35, NDUFS4and the fat metabolism and obesity genes: AACS, SMPDL3B, CTNNBL1, NDUFS4 and LIMD2. In the network analysis, we identified two modules significantly correlated with FCR. Pathway enrichment of modules identified MTR, electron transport chain and DNA repair as enriched pathways. In the network analysis, the mitochondrial gene group NDUF was a key hub group, showing potential as biomarkers. Comparing with human transcriptomic exercise studies, genes related to exercise displayed enrichment in our FCR related genes. We conclude that mitochondrial activity is a driver for FCR in muscle tissue, and mitochondrial genes could be potential biomarkers for FCR in pigs. We hypothesize that increased FE mimics processes triggered in exercised muscle.",

The clinical significance of PD-1/PD-Ls expression and methylation in LGG were explored.

Moreover, GO enticement analysis of PD-1/PD-Ls co-expressed genes was performed as well.

    "abstract": "Loss-of-function mutations in both alleles of the human insulin receptor gene (INSR) cause extreme insulin resistance (IR) and usually death in childhood, with few therapeutic options. Bivalent anti-receptor antibodies can elicit insulin-like signaling by mutant INSR in cultured cells, but whether this translates into meaningful metabolic benefits in vivo, where dynamics of insulin signaling and receptor recycling are more complex, is unknown. To address this we adopted a strategy to model human insulin receptoropathy in mice, using Cre recombinase delivered by adeno-associated virus to knock out endogenous hepatic Insr acutely in floxed Insr mice (L- IRKO+GFP), before adenovirus-mediated  add-back of wild-type (WT) or mutant human INSR. Two murine anti-INSR monoclonal antibodies, previously shown to be surrogate agonists for mutant INSR, were then tested by intraperitoneal injections. As expected, L-IRKO+GFP mice showed glucose intolerance and severe hyperinsulinemia, and this was fully corrected by add-back of WT but neither D734A nor S350L mutant INSR. Antibody injection improved glucose tolerance in D734A INSR-expressing mice and reduced hyperinsulinemia in both S350L and D734A INSR-expressing animals, and did not cause hypoglycemia in WT INSR-expressing mice. Antibody treatment also downregulated both wild-type and mutant INSR protein, attenuating its beneficial metabolic effects. Anti-INSR antibodies thus improve IR in an acute model of insulin receptoropathy, but these findings imply a narrow therapeutic window determined by competing effects of antibodies to stimulate receptors and induce their downregulation.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryBivalent anti-insulin receptor antibodies improve glycaemic control, but downregulate receptor expression, in a novel mouse model of lethal human insulin receptoropathy.",

    "abstract": "Zone I and zone III hepatocytes metabolize ammonia through urea cycle and drug by cytochrome P450, respectively. Ammonia has a cytotoxic effect, and can therefore be used as a selection agent for enrichment of hepatocytes. Besides, isolated hepatocytes from livers can be propagated ex vivo under appropriate condition. However, it has not been investigated so far whether ammonia-treated hepatocyte-like cells are able to proliferate in vitro. In this study, we employed the ammonia selection strategy to purify hepatocyte-like cells that were differentiated from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) that are embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells. Hepatocyte-like cells after exposure to ammonia highly expressed the CPS1 gene that metabolizes ammonia to carbamoyl phosphate. The resistance to cytotoxicity or cell death by ammonia is probably attributed to the metabolic activity of ammonia in the cells. In addition to the ammonia metabolism-related genes, ammonia-selected PSC-derived hepatocytes increased expression of the CYP3A4 gene, one of the cytochrome P450 genes, that is mainly expressed in zone III hepatocytes. Ammonia-selected hepatocyte-like cells derived from both ESCs and iPSCs can be propagated in vitro up to 30 population doublings for more than 190 days without affecting expression of the liver-associated genes, implying that the ammonia-selected cells have immortality or equivalent life span on the appropriate feeder cells like ESCs and iPSCs. The long-term cultivation of ammonia-selected hepatocyte-like cells resulted in the increased expression of hepatocyte-associated genes such as the CPS1 and CYP3A4 genes. The ammonia selection method to enrich a hepatocyte population was also applicable to immortalized cells from the liver. Ammonia treatment in combination with in vitro propagation will be used to obtain large amounts of hepatocytes or hepatocyte-like cells for pharmacology, toxicology and regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of quiescence and cell cycle entry is pivotal for the maintenance of stem cell populations. Regulatory mechanisms however are poorly understood. In particular it is unclear how the activity of single stem cells is coordinated within the population, or if cells divide in a purely random fashion. We addressed this issue by analyzing division events in an adult neural stem cell (NSC) population of the zebrafish telencephalon. Spatial statistics and mathematical modeling of over 80,000 NSCs in 36 brains revealed weakly aggregated, non-random division patterns in space and time. Analyzing divisions at two timepoints allowed us to infer cell cycle and S-phase lengths computationally. Interestingly, we observed rapid cell cycle re-entries in roughly 15% of newly born NSCs. In agent based simulations of NSC populations, this re-dividing activity sufficed to induce aggregated spatio-temporal division patterns that matched the ones observed experimentally. In contrast, omitting re-divisions lead to a random spatio-temporal distribution of dividing cells. Spatio-temporal aggregation of dividing stem cells can thus emerge from the cells history, regardless of possible feedback mechanisms in the population.",

Many studies have addressed how local signals from neighboring niche cells regulate stem cell identity and their proliferative potential. However, the regulation of stem cells by tissue-extrinsic signals in response to external cues remains poorly understood. Here we report that efferent octopaminergic neurons projecting to the ovary are essential for germline stem cell (GSC) proliferation in response to mating in female Drosophila. The neuronal activity of the octopaminergic neurons is required for mating-induced GSC proliferation as they relay the mating signal from Sex peptide receptor-positive cholinergic neurons. Octopamine and its receptor Oamb are also required for mating-induced GSC proliferation via intracellular Ca2+ signaling. Moreover, we identified Matrix metalloproteinase-2 as a downstream component of the octopamine-Ca2+ signaling to induce GSC proliferation. Our study provides a mechanism describing how neuronal system couples stem cell behavior to external cues through stem cell niche signaling.",

For submerged macrophytes, adaptation to water depth and light variation is particularly important. To determine the morphological and physiological adaptive strategies of Vallisneria natans at different water depths and light conditions, we combined field investigation, light control experiment and in situ physiological response experiment. In the field investigation and the light control experiment, both water depth and light intensity had prominent effects on the morphological of V. natans, especially in fresh weight and leaf length. The leaf length elongated more rapidly at intermediate water depth sites with lower light intensity. In the in situ experiment, the survival boundary of V. natans is 5.5 m in Lake Erhai. Below this depth, the chlorophyll-a content increased gradually with increasing water depth. Our results demonstrated that V. natans can adapt to water depth and light availability by changing morphological, physiological and resource allocation. At low light condition, V. natans invested more resource for light acquisition, simultaneously, changing the photosynthetic pigment content to compensate for light attenuation; conversely, more resource was directed towards reproduction. These results will provide new insight for species selection when conducting aquatic plants restoration in freshwater ecosystem.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIWater depth and light availability affect the morphology, physiology, and resource allocation of V. natans.\nC_LIO_LIAn alternative resource allocation pattern of V. natans could shift between light acquisition and reproduction.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-based homing gene drive is a genetic control technique aiming to modify or eradicate natural populations. This technique is based on the release of individuals carrying an engineered piece of DNA that can be preferentially inherited by the progeny. Developing countermeasures is important to control the spread of gene drives, should they result in unanticipated damages. One proposed countermeasure is the introduction of individuals carrying a brake construct that targets and inactivates the drive allele but leaves the wild-type allele unaffected. Here we develop models to investigate the efficiency of such brakes. We consider a variable population size and use a combination of analytical and numerical methods to determine the conditions where a brake can prevent the extinction of a population targeted by an eradication drive. We find that a brake is not guaranteed to prevent eradication and that characteristics of both the brake and the drive affect the likelihood of recovering the wild-type population. In particular, brakes that restore fitness are more efficient than brakes that do not. Our model also indicates that threshold-dependent drives (drives that can spread only when introduced above a threshold) are more amenable to control with a brake than drives that can spread from an arbitrary low introduction frequency (threshold-independent drives). Based on our results, we provide practical recommendations and discuss safety issues.\n\nArticle summary for Issue HighlightsHoming gene drive is a new genetic control technology that aims to spread a genetically engineered DNA construct within natural populations even when it impairs fitness. In case of unanticipated damages, it has been proposed to stop homing gene drives by releasing individuals carrying a genedrive brake; however, the efficiency of such brakes has been little studied. The authors develop a model to investigate the dynamics of a population targeted by a homing drive in absence or in presence of brake. The model provides insights for the design of more efficient brakes and safer gene drives.",

    "abstract": "ABSTACTThe type II secretion system (T2SS) is a multiprotein machinery spanning the diderm of gram-negative bacteria. T2SS contributes to the virulence of numerous gram-negative pathogens, including the multidrug resistant species Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumonia and Vibrio cholerae. Even though the T2SS has been studied extensively over the past three decades, our understanding of the molecular basis of its biogenesis and of its overall structure still remains unclear. Here we show that the core component of the inner membrane platform, the GspLM membrane protein complex, can be isolated as a dimer of dimers. Importantly, the complex is able to bind the T2SS ATPase, GspE, with high affinity. Finally, we have developed single domain VHH camelid antibodies (nanobodies) against the GspLM complex and have identified a nanobody that effectively prevents the cytoplasmic domain of GspL, GspLcyto, from binding to GspE. Our findings suggest that the T2SS ATPase is permanently associated with the inner membrane platform and that the GspELM complex should be considered as a key subassembly for the biogenesis of the T2SS apparatus.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeriodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that occurs in periodontal tissues and can cause tooth loosening and loss in severe cases. As the main effector of downstream of Hippo signaling pathway, Yes-related protein 1 (YAP1) plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the role of YAP1 in periodontitis has not been reported.\n\nMethodsCell activity was detected by CCk-8. YAP1 was overexpressed by cell transfection, and then RT-qPCR and western blot were used to detect the expression of YAP1. The cell proliferation was determined by clone formation assay, and the expression of proliferation-related proteins was determined by western blot. The cell differentiation was detected by Elisa kit of ALP and alizarin red staining. Finally, western blot was used to detect the expression of differentiation-related protein and Hippo signaling pathway-related proteins.\n\nResultsWith the increase of concentration induced by TNF-, the cell survival rate of human periodontal ligament stem cells (HPDLSC) decreased significantly. After the overexpression of YAP1, cell proliferation and proliferation-related protein expression increased. Overexpression of YAP1 can improve the differentiation and the formation of osteoblasts of HPDLSCs induced by TNF-. The expression of Hippo signaling pathway-related proteins transcriptional coactivators with PDZ binding domains (TAZ), TEA domain family member (TRED) increased and proliferation-related protein P27 decreased.\n\nConclusionTNF- can inhibit proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of HPDLSCs, which can be ameliorated by the YAP1 gene through the Hippo signaling pathway. Our paper suggested that YAP1 may be a potential therapeutic target for periodontitis.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an emerging global health crisis. With over 7 million confirmed cases to date, this pandemic continues to expand, spurring research to discover vaccines and therapies. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus responsible for this disease. It initiates entry into human cells by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via the receptor binding domain (RBD) of its spike protein (S). Disrupting the SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding to ACE2 with designer drugs has the potential to inhibit the virus from entering human cells, presenting a new modality for therapeutic intervention. Peptide-based binders are an attractive solution to inhibit the RBD-ACE2 interaction by adequately covering the extended protein contact interface. Using molecular dynamics simulations based on the recently solved cryo-EM structure of ACE2 in complex with SARS-CoV-2-RBD, we observed that the ACE2 peptidase domain (PD) 1 helix is important for binding SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Using automated fast-flow peptide synthesis, we chemically synthesized a 23-mer peptide fragment of the ACE2 PD 1 helix (SBP1) composed entirely of proteinogenic amino acids. Chemical synthesis of SBP1 was complete in 1.5 hours, and after work up and isolation >20 milligrams of pure material was obtained. Bio-layer interferometry (BLI) revealed that SBP1 associates with micromolar affinity to insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD protein obtained from Sino Biological. Association of SBP1 was not observed to an appreciable extent to HEK cell-expressed SARS-CoV-2-RBD proteins and insect-derived variants acquired from other vendors. Moreover, competitive BLI assays showed SBP1 does not outcompete ACE2 binding to Sino Biological insect-derived SARS-CoV-2-RBD. Further investigations are ongoing to gain insight into the molecular and structural determinants of the variable binding behavior to different SARS-CoV-2-RBD protein variants.",

Herein, we show that the ribonucleoside analog {beta}-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC, EIDD-1931) has broad spectrum antiviral activity against SARS-CoV 2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and related zoonotic group 2b or 2c Bat-CoVs, as well as increased potency against a coronavirus bearing resistance mutations to another nucleoside analog inhibitor. In mice infected with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, both prophylactic and therapeutic administration of EIDD-2801, an orally bioavailable NHC-prodrug (b-D-N4-hydroxycytidine-5-isopropyl ester), improved pulmonary function, and reduced virus titer and body weight loss. Decreased MERS-CoV yields in vitro and in vivo were associated with increased transition mutation frequency in viral but not host cell RNA, supporting a mechanism of lethal mutagenesis. The potency of NHC/EIDD-2801 against multiple coronaviruses, its therapeutic efficacy, and oral bioavailability in vivo, all highlight its potential utility as an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 and other future zoonotic coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "Microtubule polarity in axons and dendrites defines the direction of intracellular transport in neurons. Axons contain arrays of uniformly polarized microtubules with plus-ends facing the tips of the processes (plus-end-out), while dendrites contain microtubules with minus-end-out orientation. It has been shown that cytoplasmic dynein, targeted to cortical actin, removes minus-end-out microtubules from axons. Here we have identified Spindly, a protein known for recruitment of dynein to kinetochores in mitosis, as a key factor required for dynein-dependent microtubule sorting in axons of Drosophila neurons. Depletion of Spindly affects polarity of axonal microtubules in vivo and in primary neuronal cultures. In addition to these defects, depletion of Spindly in neurons causes major collapse of axonal patterning in the third-instar larval brain as well as severe coordination impairment in adult flies. These defects can be fully rescued by full-length Spindly, but not by variants with mutations in its dynein-binding site. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that Spindly binds F-actin, suggesting that Spindly serves as a link between dynein and cortical actin in axons. Therefore, Spindly plays a critical role during neurodevelopment by mediating dynein-driven sorting of axonal microtubules.\n\nSignificance StatementNeurons send and receive electrical signals through long microtubule-filled neurites called axons and dendrites. One of the main structural differences between axons and dendrites is how their microtubules are organized. Axons contains microtubules with their plus-ends out while microtubules in dendrites are organized with mixed or plus-end-in orientation. Dynein, the main minus-end microtubule motor, anchored to cortical actin filaments in the axons is responsible for the uniform microtubule polarity in axons. However, it is unknown how dynein is recruited to the actin cortex in axons. The major finding of this work is that Spindly, a protein involved in anchoring dynein to kinetochores during cell division, has a second important function in interphase cells recruiting dynein to the actin cortex in axons.",

Previous studies suggest that the IH and IF MN pools have a unique developmental history in comparison to limb MN pools. Consistent with having this unique development, we find that the IH and IF MN pools are labeled postnatally using a CRE knock-in mouse line of Atoh1, a developmentally expressed basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, while limb-innervating MN pools are not. Approximately 60% of the IH and IF MN pools are labeled and are a mixture of alpha and gamma-MNs. In addition, because Atoh1 is known developmentally to specify many cerebellar-projecting neurons, we tested the hypothesis that IH and IF MNs can send axon collaterals to the cerebellum as a mechanism of corollary discharge. Using intersectional genetic, viral labeling, and retrograde labeling strategies, we were unable to provide evidence in support of this idea. As a secondary finding of our viral labeling experiments, we report here that injection of both AAV and Lentiviruses in the periphery can cross the blood-brain barrier to infect Purkinje cells within the central nervous system. Altogether, though, we find that labeling of the IH and IF motor neurons using the Atoh1 CRE knock-in mouse suggests that IH and IF MNs have a unique developmental history and that this mouse strain might be a useful tool to target these specific sets of neurons allowing for functional studies of fine motor control.\n\nSignificance StatementMotor neurons (MNs) of the intrinsic hand and foot (IH and IF) are labeled postnatally using a CRE knock-in mouse line of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor Atoh1 indicating a unique developmental history.

Using Raman imaging microscopy, we identified heterogeneous lipid profiles in cellular organelles attributed uniquely to IDH1 mutations. Via organelle lipidomics, we found an increase in saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids in the endoplasmic reticulum of IDH1mut cells compared with IDHWT glioma. We showed that these fatty acids incorporate into phospholipids and induce organelle dysfunctions, with prominent dilation of Golgi apparatus, which can be restored by transient knockdown of stearyl-CoA desaturase or inhibition of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) formation. We validated these findings using tissue from patients with glioma. Oleic acid addition led to increased sensitivity to apoptosis of IDH1mut cells compared with IDHWT. Addition of D-2HG to U251WT cells lead in increased ER and Golgi apparatus dilation. Collectively, these studies provide clinically relevant insights into the functional link between IDH1mut-induced lipid alterations and organelle dysfunction, with therapeutic implications.\n\nSignificanceGliomas are devastating tumors, with the most aggressive form--glioblastoma multiforme-- correlated with a mean patient survival of 14.5 months.

Our results demonstrate that previous coronavirus outbreaks have been understudied compared to other viruses. We also show that the research volume of emerging infectious diseases is very high after an outbreak and drops drastically upon the containment of the disease.

Based on our analysis of hepatitis C virus and coronavirus replication, and the molecular structures and activities of viral inhibitors, we previously demonstrated that three nucleotide analogues inhibit the SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Here, using polymerase extension experiments, we have demonstrated that the active triphosphate form of Sofosbuvir (a key component of the FDA approved hepatitis C drug EPCLUSA), is incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, and blocks further incorporation. Using the same molecular insight, we selected the active triphosphate forms of three other anti-viral agents, Alovudine, AZT (an FDA approved HIV/AIDS drug) and Tenofovir alafenamide (TAF, an FDA approved drug for HIV and hepatitis B) for evaluation as inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We demonstrated the ability of these three viral polymerase inhibitors, 3-fluoro-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate, 3-azido-3-deoxythymidine triphosphate and Tenofovir diphosphate (the active triphosphate forms of Alovudine, AZT and TAF, respectively) to be incorporated by SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, where they also terminate further polymerase extension. These results offer a strong molecular basis for these nucleotide analogues to be evaluated as potential therapeutics for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease leads to high morbidity rates among humans. It is a serious disease that requires curative treatments other than kidney transplantation. Recently, we successfully established the iPS-derived generated kidney, which might produce urine. The urine can be directed to the native bladder with a stepwise peristaltic ureter system, followed by anastomosis with the recipient ureter for reconstruction of the urinary tract. However, the growth of the regenerated kidney varies significantly, whereas the time window of the anastomosis is quite narrow. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate the growth of transplanted metanephros with bladder periodically and noninvasively using computed tomography and ultrasonography. Ultrasonographic findings showed high correlations with computed tomographic findings and clearly evaluated metanephros with bladder. We found that the degree of growth of the metanephros with bladder after the transplantation differed in each individual. However, most of them reached the appropriate period for urinary tract reconstruction within 3 weeks after transplantation. Optimizing the stepwise peristaltic ureter system anastomosis by ultrasonography reduced long-term tubular dilation of the metanephros, thereby decreasing fibrosis caused by transforming growth factor-{beta}. This may be significantly related to long-term maturation of fetal grafts. These results provide new insights into transplanting regenerated kidneys in higher animals. We are one step closer to the first human trial of kidney generation.",

Successful drug development to prevent cardiometabolic syndrome and associated comorbidities requires preclinical models predictive of human conditions. To characterize the heart failure component of cardiometabolic syndrome, cardiometabolic, metabolic, and renal biomarkers were evaluated in obese and lean ZSF1 20-to 22-week-old male rats. Cardiac function, exercise capacity, and left ventricular gene expression were also analyzed. Obese ZSF1 rats exhibited multiple features of human cardiometabolic syndrome by pathological changes in systemic renal, metabolic, and cardiovascular disease circulating biomarkers. Hemodynamic assessment, echocardiography, and decreased exercise capacity confirmed heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. RNA-seq results demonstrated changes in left ventricular gene expression associated with fatty acid and branched chain amino acid metabolism, cardiomyopathy, cardiac hypertrophy, and heart failure. Twelve weeks of growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) treatment significantly decreased body weight, food intake, blood glucose, and triglycerides and improved exercise capacity in obese ZSF1 males. Systemic cardiovascular injury markers were significantly lower in GDF15-treated obese ZSF1 rats. Obese ZSF1 male rats represent a preclinical model for human cardiometabolic syndrome with established heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. GDF15 treatment mediated dietary response and demonstrated a cardioprotective effect in obese ZSF1 rats.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy rate is a major determinant of population dynamics of wild ungulates and of productivity of livestock systems. Allocation of feeding resources, including stocking rates, prior to and during the breeding season is a crucial determinant of this vital rate. Thus, quantification of effects and interaction among multiple factors that affect pregnancy rate is essential for management and conservation of pasture-based systems. Pregnancy rate of 2982 heifers and primiparous cows was studied as a function of animal category, average daily gain during the breeding season, stocking rate, pasture type and body weight at the beginning of the breeding season. Data were obtained from 43 experiments conducted in commercial ranches and research stations in the Pampas region between 1976 and 2015. Stocking rate ranged from 200 to 464 kg live weight/ha, which brackets values for most of the grazinglands in similar regions. Age at breeding was 14-36 months (24.6 {+/-} 7.5 months); initial breeding weights were 129-506 kg and 194-570 kg for heifers and primiparous cows. Pregnancy rate was modeled with an apriori set of explanatory variables where proximate variables (breed, body weight at start of breeding, weight gain during breeding and category) were included first and subsequently modeled as functions of other variables (pasture type, supplementation and stocking rate). This modeling approach allowed detection of direct and indirect effects (through nutrition and body weight) of factors that affect pregnancy rate. Taurine (Bos taurus breeds, N = 1058) had higher pregnancy rate than B. Taurus x B. indicus crossbreed (N = 1924) females. Pregnancy rate of heifers and primiparous cows grazing in natural grasslands decreased with increasing stocking rate, but no effect of stocking rate was detected in cultivated and improved pastures. Pregnancy rate increased with increasing average daily gain during the breeding season. Use of cultivated or improved natural pastures promotes higher pregnancy rate, as well as allows higher in stocking rate at the regional level. Body weight at the start of the breeding season is the primary determinant of pregnancy rates in heifer and primiparous cows.",

    "abstract": "Recent experiments with super-resolution live cell microscopy revealed that nonmuscle myosin II minifilaments are much more dynamic than formerly appreciated, often showing plastic processes such as splitting, concatenation and stacking. Here we combine sequence information, electrostatics and elasticity theory to demonstrate that the parallel staggers at 14.3, 43.2 and 72 nm have a strong tendency to splay their heads away from the minifilament, thus potentially initiating the diverse processes seen in live cells. In contrast, the straight antiparallel stagger with an overlap of 43 nm is very stable and likely initiates minifilament nucleation. Using stochastic dynamics in a newly defined energy landscape, we predict that the optimal parallel staggers between the myosin rods are obtained by a trial-and-error process in which two rods attach and re-attach at different staggers by rolling and zipping motion. The experimentally observed staggers emerge as the configurations with the largest contact times. We find that contact times increase from isoforms C to B to A, that A-B-heterodimers are surprisingly stable and that myosin 18A should incorporate into mixed filaments with a small stagger. Our findings suggest that nonmuscle myosin II minifilaments in the cell are first formed by isoform A and then convert to mixed A-B-filaments, as observed experimentally.\n\nAuthor summaryNonmuscle myosin II (NM2) is a non-processive molecular motor that assembles into minifilaments with a typical size of 300 nm to generate force and motion in the actin cytoskeleton. This process is essential for many cellular processes such as adhesion, migration, division and mechanosensing. Due to their small size below the resolution limit, minifilaments are a challenge for imaging with traditional light microscopy. With the advent of super-resolution microscopy, however, it has become apparent that the formation of NM2-minifilaments is much more dynamic than formerly appreciated. Modeling the electrostatic interaction between the rigid rods of the myosin monomers has confirmed the main staggers observed in experiments, but cannot explain these high dynamics. Here we complement electrostatics by elasticity theory and stochastic dynamics to show that the parallel staggers are likely to splay away from the main axis of the minifilament and that monomers attach and deattach with rolling and zipping motions. Based on the sequences of the different NM2-isoforms, we predict that isoform A forms the most stable homofilaments and that A-B-heterofilaments are also very stable.",

    "abstract": "Rapidly increasing pyrethroid insecticide resistance and changes in vector biting and resting behavior pose serious challenges in malaria control. Mosquito repellents, especially spatial repellents, have received much attention from industry. Many of these repellents contain the same or similar chemicals as those used in insecticides. Does resistance to insecticides affect the efficacy of spatial repellents? We attempted to simulate interactions between mosquitoes and repellents using a machine learning method, the self-propelled particle (SPP) model, which we modified to include attractiveness/repellency effects. We simulated a random walk scenario and scenarios with insecticide susceptible/resistant mosquitoes against repellent alone and against repellent plus attractant (to mimic a human host). We assumed attractant odors and repellent chemicals diffused randomly and omnidirectionally, and that mosquitoes were confined in a cubic cage. We modified the velocity and direction components of SPP using attraction/repulsion rates and concentrations. Simulation results indicated that without attractant/repellent, mosquitoes would fly anywhere in the cage at random. With attractant, mosquitoes might or might not fly toward the source (i.e., the human), depending on the simulation time (and thus the attractant concentration distribution). Eventually, however, all mosquitoes were attracted to the source of the odor. With repellent, results depended on the amount of chemical used and the level of mosquito insecticide resistance. All insecticide-susceptible mosquitoes eventually moved to the corner of the cage farthest from the repellent release point. Surprisingly, a high proportion of highly resistant mosquitoes might reach the attractant release point (the human) earlier in the simulation when repellent was present compare to no repellent was present. At fixed concentration, a high proportion of mosquitoes could be able to reach the host when the relative repellency efficacy (compare to attractant efficacy) was <1, whereas, no mosquitoes reached the host when the relative repellency efficacy was > 1. This result implies that repellent may not be sufficient against highly physiologically insecticide resistant mosquitoes, since very high concentrations of repellent are neither practically feasible nor cost-effective.",

Using standard single marker- and haplotype-based approaches, we report evidence of two regions with distinctive patterns of genetic variation, one in the far northeast, and another in the south of Norway, as indicated by fixation indices, haplotype sharing, homozygosity and effective population size. We detect and quantify a component of Uralic Sami ancestry that is enriched in the North. On a finer scale, we find that rates of migration have been affected by topography like mountain ridges. In the broader Scandinavian context, we detect elevated relatedness between the mid- and northern border areas towards Sweden. The main finding of this study is that despite Norways long maritime history and as a former Danish territory, the region closest to mainland Europe in the south appears to have been the most isolated region in Norway, highlighting the open sea as a barrier to gene flow.",

    "abstract": "Bone loss is one of the consequences of aging, leading to diseases such as osteoporosis and increased susceptibility to fragility fractures and therefore considerable morbidity and mortality in humans. Here we identify microRNA 146a as an essential epigenetic switch controlling bone loss with age. Mice deficient in miR-146a show regular development of their skeleton. However, while WT mice start to lose bone with age, animals deficient in miR-146a continue to accrue bone throughout their life span. Increased bone mass is due to increased generation and activity of osteoblasts in miR-146a deficient mice as a result of sustained activation of bone anabolic Wnt signaling during aging. Deregulation of the miR-146a target genes Wnt1 and Wnt5a parallel bone accrual and osteoblast generation, which is accompanied by reduced development of bone marrow adiposity. Furthermore, miR-146a deficient mice are protected from ovariectomy induced bone loss. In humans, levels of miR-146a are increased in patients suffering fragility fractures in comparison to those who do not.\n\nThese data identify miR-146a as a crucial epigenetic temporal regulator which essentially controls bone homeostasis during aging by regulating bone anabolic Wnt signaling. Therefore, miR-146a might be a powerful therapeutic target to prevent age related bone dysfunction such as the development of bone marrow adiposity and osteoporosis.",

    "abstract": "Primary cilia are microtubule-based organelles involved in key signaling and sensing processes in eukaryotic cells. Unlike motile cilia, which have been thoroughly studied, the structure and the composition of primary cilia remain largely unexplored despite their fundamental role in development and homeostasis. They have for long been falsely regarded as simplified versions of motile cilia because they lack distinctive elements such as dynein arms, radial spokes, and central pair complex. However, revealing the detailed molecular composition and 3D structure of primary cilia is necessary in order to understand the mechanisms that govern their functions. Such structural investigations are so far being precluded by the challenging preparation of primary cilia for cryo-electron microscopy. Here, we developed an enabling method for investigating the structure of primary cilia at molecular resolution by cryo-electron tomography. We show that the well-known \"9+0\" arrangement of microtubule doublets is present only at the base of the primary cilium. A few microns away from the base the ciliary architecture changes into an unstructured bundle of EB1-decorated microtubule singlets and some actin filaments. Our results suggest the existence of a previously unobserved crosstalk between actin filaments and microtubules in the primary cilium. Our work provides unprecedented insights into the molecular structure of primary cilia and a general framework for uncovering their molecular composition and function in health and disease. This opens up new possibilities to study aspects of this important organelle that have so far been out of reach.",

Foremost among these is the activation of anoikis, caspase-mediated cell death induced by ECM-detachment. In addition to anoikis, loss of ECM-attachment causes profound alterations in cellular metabolism that can lead to anoikis-independent cell death. Here, we describe a surprising role for serum and glucocorticoid kinase-1 (SGK1) in the promotion of energy production when cells are detached. Our data demonstrate that SGK1 activation is necessary and sufficient for ATP generation during ECM-detachment and anchorage-independent growth. More specifically, SGK1 promotes a substantial elevation in glucose uptake due to elevated GLUT1 transcription. In addition, carbon flux into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is necessary to accommodate elevated glucose uptake and PPP-mediated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) is necessary for ATP production. Thus, our data unmask SGK1 as master regulator of glucose metabolism and cell survival during ECM-detached conditions.",
