    "abstract": "It is an uninformative truism to state that the brain operates at multiple spatial and temporal scales, each with each own set of emergent phenomena. More worthy of attention is the point that our current understanding of it cannot clearly indicate which of these phenomenological scales are the significant contributors to the brains function and primary output (i.e. behaviour). Apart from the sheer complexity of the problem, a major contributing factor to this state of affairs is the lack of instrumentation that can simultaneously address these multiple scales without causing function altering damages to the underlying tissue. One important facet of this problem is that standard neural recording devices normally require one output connection per electrode. This limits the number of electrodes that can fit along the thin shafts of implantable probes generating a limiting balance between density and spread. Sharing a single output connection between multiple electrodes relaxes this constraint and permits designs of ultra-high density probes.\n\nHere we report the design and in-vivo validation of such a device, a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) scanning probe with 1344 electrodes; the outcome of the European research project NeuroSeeker. We show that this design targets both local and global spatial scales by allowing the simultaneous recording of more than 1000 neurons spanning 7 functional regions with a single shaft. The neurons show similar recording longevity and signal to noise ratio to passive probes of comparable size and no adverse effects in awake or anesthetized animals. Addressing the data management of this device we also present novel visualization and monitoring methods. Using the probe with freely moving animals we show how accessing a number of cortical and subcortical brain regions offers a novel perspective on how the brain operates around salient behavioural events. Finally, we compare this probe with lower density, non CMOS designs (which have to adhere to the one electrode per output line rule). We show that an increase in density results in capturing neural firing patterns, undetectable by lower density devices, which correlate to self-similar structures inherent in complex naturalistic behaviour.\n\nTo help design electrode configurations for future, even higher density, CMOS probes, recordings from many different brain regions were obtained with an ultra-dense passive probe.",

    "abstract": "Correlations of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) signals are being widely used for assessing functional brain connectivity in health and disease. However, an association was recently observed between rsfMRI connectivity modulations and the head motion parameters and regarded as a causal relationship, which has raised serious concerns about the validity of many rsfMRI findings. Here, we studied the origin of this rsfMRI-motion association and its relationship to arousal modulations. By using a template-matching method to locate arousal-related fMRI changes, we showed that the effects of high motion time points on rsfMRI connectivity are largely due to their significant overlap with arousal-affected time points. The finding suggests that the association between rsfMRI connectivity and the head motion parameters arises from their co-modulations at transient arousal modulations, and this information is critical not only for proper interpretation of motion-associated rsfMRI connectivity changes but also for controlling the potential confounding effects of arousal modulation on rsfMRI metrics.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMany recent phylogenetic methods have focused on accurately inferring species trees when there is gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). For almost all of these methods, and for phylogenetic methods in general, the data for each locus is assumed to consist of orthologous, single-copy sequences. Loci that are present in more than a single copy in any of the studied genomes are excluded from the data. These steps greatly reduce the number of loci available for analysis. The question we seek to answer in this study is: What happens if one runs such species tree inference methods on data where paralogy is present, in addition to or without ILS being present? Through simulation studies and analyses of two large biological data sets, we show that running such methods on data with paralogs can still provide accurate results. We use multiple different methods, some of which are based directly on the multispecies coalescent (MSC) model, and some of which have been proven to be statistically consistent under it. We also treat the paralogous loci in multiple ways: from explicitly denoting them as paralogs, to randomly selecting one copy per species. In all cases the inferred species trees are as accurate as equivalent analyses using single-copy orthologs. Our results have significant implications for the use of ILS-aware phylogenomic analyses, demonstrating that they do not have to be restricted to single-copy loci. This will greatly increase the amount of data that can be used for phylogenetic inference.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) has phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous characteristics. A simulation study demonstrated that attempts to categorize patients with a complex disease into more homogeneous subgroups could have more power to elucidate hidden heritability.\n\nMethodsWe conducted cluster analyses using the k-means algorithm with a cluster number of 15 based on phenotypic variables from the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC). As a preliminary study, we conducted a conventional genome-wide association study (GWAS) with a dataset of 597 ASD cases and 370 controls. In the second step, we divided cases based on the clustering results and conducted GWAS in each of the subgroups vs controls (cluster-based GWAS). We also conducted cluster-based GWAS on another SSC dataset of 712 probands and 354 controls in the replication stage.\n\nResultsIn the preliminary study, we observed no significant associations. In the second step of cluster-based GWASs, we identified 65 chromosomal loci, which included 30 intragenic loci located in 21 genes and 35 intergenic loci that satisfied the threshold of P<5.0x10-8. Some of these loci were located within or near previously reported candidate genes for ASD: CDH5, CNTN5, CNTNAP5, DNAH17, DPP10, DSCAM, FOXK1, GABBR2, GRIN2A5, ITPR1, NTM, SDK1, SNCA and SRRM4. Of these 65 significant chromosomal loci, rs11064685 located within the SRRM4 gene had a significantly different distribution in the cases vs. controls in the replication cohort.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that clustering may successfully identify subgroups with relatively homogeneous disease etiologies. Further cluster validation and replication studies are warranted in larger cohorts.",

While cost-effective and accurate for quantification, short-read RNA-seq lacks the ability to resolve full-length transcript isoforms despite increasingly sophisticated computational methods. Long-read sequencing platforms such as Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) and Oxford Nanopore (ONT) bypass the transcript reconstruction challenges of short reads. Here we introduce TALON, the ENCODE4 pipeline for platform-independent analysis of long-read transcriptomes. We apply TALON to the GM12878 cell line and show that while both PacBio and ONT technologies perform well at full-transcript discovery and quantification, each displayed distinct technical artifacts. We further apply TALON to mouse hippocampus and cortex transcriptomes and find that 422 genes found in these regions have more reads associated with novel isoforms than with annotated ones. We demonstrate that TALON is a capable of tracking both known and novel transcript models as well as their expression levels across datasets for both simple studies and in larger projects. These properties will enable TALON users to move beyond the limitations of short-read data to perform isoform discovery and quantification in a uniform manner on existing and future long-read platforms.",

    "abstract": "This is the first study that describes the effect of adding mitigation measures on the freshwater biodiversity of all waterbody types in agricultural catchments. We measured alpha (site) and gamma (catchment) richness annually over a nine-year period in all the streams, ponds and ditches in three upper-catchments in the English lowlands, and investigated whether freshwater plant biodiversity could be increased by adding: (i) multi-functional ecosystem services measures to intercept pollutants, store water and promote biodiversity, and, (ii) biodiversity-only protection measures. In the absence of measures, all catchments saw a decline in macrophyte richness during the survey (mean species loss of 1% pa, rare species loss of 2% pa). Ponds were a key habitat with a disproportionate influence on catchment trends. Five years after introducing measures, natural colonisation of ecosystem services waterbodies (dammed streams and ditches, runoff ponds, flood storage ponds) largely cancelled-out the background loss of plant species but, importantly, did not restore the loss of rare plants. Adding clean water ponds as a biodiversity-only enhancement measure brought substantial benefits: increasing total-catchment richness by 26%, and the number of rare plant species by 181%. Populations of spatially restricted species also increased. Adding stream debris-dams as a biodiversity measure did not affect plant richness or rarity. The findings suggest that ecosystem services measures could bring some biodiversity benefits to agricultural catchments. However, creating clean-water ponds specifically targeted for biodiversity could hold considerable potential as a tool to help stem, and even reverse, ongoing declines in freshwater plant biodiversity across farming landscapes.",

This enables covalent biotin labelling of proteins and allows subsequent capture and identification of interacting and neighbouring proteins without the need for the protein complex to remain intact.

We show that TurboID is the most promiscuous variant in several plant model systems and establish protocols which combine Mass Spectrometry-based analysis with harsh extraction and washing conditions. We demonstrate the applicability of TurboID in capturing membrane-associated protein interactomes using Lotus japonicus symbiotically active receptor kinases as test-case. We further benchmark the efficiency of various PBLs in comparison with one-step affinity purification approaches. We identified both known as well as novel interactors of the endocytic TPLATE complex. We furthermore present a straightforward strategy to identify both non-biotinylated as well as biotinylated peptides in a single experimental setup.

    "abstract": "Growth factors regulate cell fates, including their proliferation, differentiation, survival, and death, according to the cell type. Even when the response to a specific growth factor is deterministic for collective cell behavior, significant levels of fluctuation are often observed between single cells. Statistical analyses of single-cell responses provide insights into the mechanism of cell fate decisions but very little is known about the distributions of the internal states of cells responding to growth factors. Using multi-color immunofluorescent staining, we have here detected the phosphorylation of seven elements in the early response of the ERBB-RAS-MAPK system to two growth factors. Among these seven elements, five were analyzed simultaneously in distinct combinations in the same single cells. Although principle component analysis suggested cell-type and input specific phosphorylation patterns, cell-to-cell fluctuation was large. Mutual information analysis suggested that cells use multitrack (bush-like) signal transduction pathways under conditions in which clear cell fate changes have been reported. The clustering of single-cell response patterns indicated that the fate change in a cell population correlates with the large entropy of the response, suggesting a bet-hedging strategy is used in decision making. A comparison of true and randomized datasets further indicated that this large variation is not produced by simple reaction noise, but is defined by the properties of the signal-processing network.\n\nAuthor SummaryHow extracellular signals, such as growth factors (GFs), induce fate changes in biological cells is still not fully understood. Some GFs induce cell proliferation and others induce differentiation by stimulating a common reaction network. Although the response to each GF is reproducible for a cell population, not all single cells respond similarly. The question that arises is whether a certain GF conducts all the responding cells in the same direction during a fate change, or if it initially stimulates a variety of behaviors among single cells, from which the cells that move in the appropriate direction are later selected. Our current statistical analysis of single-cell responses suggests that the latter process, which is called a bet-hedging mechanism is plausible. The complex pathways of signal transmission seem to be responsible for this bet-hedging.",

    "abstract": "Pleiotropy (multiple phenotypic effects of single genes) and epistasis (gene interaction) have key roles in the development of complex phenotypes, especially in polymorphic taxa. The development of discrete and heritable phenotypic polymorphisms often emerges from major-effect genes that interact with other loci and have pleiotropic effects on multiple traits. We quantified gene expression changes during ontogenetic colour development in a polymorphic insect (damselfly: Ischnura elegans), with three heritable female morphs, one being a male mimic. This female colour polymorphism is maintained by male mating harassment and sexual conflict. Using transcriptome sequencing and de novo assembly, we demonstrate that all three morphs downregulate gene expression during early colour development. The morphs become increasingly differentiated during sexual maturation and when developing adult colouration. These different ontogenetic trajectories arise because the male-mimic shows accelerated (heterochronic) development, compared to the other female morphs. Many loci with regulatory functions in reproductive development are differentially regulated in the male-mimic, including upstream and downstream regulators of ecdysone signalling and transcription factors potentially influencing sexual differentiation. Our results suggest that long-term sexual conflict does not only maintain this polymorphism, but has also modulated the evolution of gene expression profiles during colour development of these sympatric female morphs.",

    "abstract": "Current phylogenetic comparative methods modeling quantitative trait evolution generally assume that, during speciation, phenotypes are inherited identically between the two daughter species. This, however, neglects the fact that species consist of a set of individuals, each bearing its own trait value. Indeed, because descendent populations after speciation are samples of a parent population, we can expect their mean phenotypes to randomly differ from one another potentially generating a \"jump\" of mean phenotypes due to asymmetrical trait inheritance at cladogenesis. Here, we aim to clarify the effect of asymmetrical trait inheritance at speciation on macroevolutionary analyses, focusing on model testing and parameter estimation using some of the most common models of quantitative trait evolution. We developed an individual-based simulation framework in which the evolution of species phenotypes is determined by trait changes at the individual level accumulating across generations and cladogenesis occurs then by separation of subsets of the individuals into new lineages. Through simulations, we assess the magnitude of phenotypic jumps at cladogenesis under different modes of trait inheritance at speciation. We show that even small jumps can strongly alter both the results of model selection and parameter estimations, potentially affecting the biological interpretation of the estimated mode of evolution of a trait. Our results call for caution when interpreting analyses of trait evolution, while highlighting the importance of testing a wide range of alternative models. In the light of our findings, we propose that future methodological advances in comparative methods should more explicitly model the intra-specific variability around species mean phenotypes and how it is inherited at speciation.",

By fully utilizing short-read data information, ConnectedReads is able to generate assembled contigs and then benefit downstream pipelines to provide higher-resolution SV discovery than that provided by other methods, especially in high diversity against reference and N-gap regions of reference. Furthermore, we demonstrate a cost-effective approach by leveraging ConnectedReads to investigate all spectra of genetic changes in population-scale studies.",

    "abstract": "Classification, one of the key ingredients for human cognition, entails establishing a criterion that splits a given feature space into mutually exclusive subspaces. In classification tasks performed in daily life, however, a criterion is often not provided explicitly but instead needs to be guessed from past samples of a feature space. For example, we judge todays temperature to be \"cold\" or \"warm\" by implicitly comparing it against a \"typical\" seasonal temperature. In such situations, establishing an optimal criterion is challenging for cognitive agents with bounded memory because it requires retrieving an entire set of past episodes with precision. As a computational account for how humans carry out this challenging operation, we developed a normative Bayesian model of classification (NBMC), in which Bayesian agents, whose working-memory precision decays as episodes elapse, continuously update their criterion as they perform a binary perceptual classification task on sequentially presented stimuli. We drew a set of specific implications regarding key properties of classification from the NBMC, and demonstrated the correspondence between the NBMC and human observers in classification behavior for each of those implications. Furthermore, in the functional magnetic resonance imaging responses acquired concurrently with behavioral data, we identified an ensemble of brain activities that coherently represent the latent variables, including the inferred criterion, of the NBMC. Given these results, we believe that the NBMC is worth being considered as a useful computational model that guides behavioral and neural studies on perceptual classification, especially for agents with bounded memory representation of past sensory events.\n\nSignificant StatementAlthough classification--assigning events into mutually exclusive classes--requires a criterion, people often have to perform various classification tasks without explicit criteria. In such situations, forming a criterion based on past experience is quite challenging because peoples memory of past events deteriorates quickly over time. Here, we provided a computational model for how a memory-bounded yet normative agent infers the criterion from past episodes to maximally perform a binary perceptual classification task. This model successfully captured several key properties of human classification behavior, and the neural signals representing its latent variables were identified in the classifying human brains. By offering a rational account for memory-bonded agents classification, our model can guide future behavioral and neural studies on perceptual classification.",

    "abstract": "A significant increase in genome instability is associated with the conformational shift of a guanine-run-containing DNA strand into the four-stranded G-quadruplex (G4) DNA. The mechanism underlying the recombination and genome rearrangements following the formation of G4 DNA in vivo has been difficult to elucidate but has become better clarified by the identification and functional characterization of several key G4 DNA-binding proteins. Mammalian nucleolin NCL is a highly specific G4 DNA-binding protein with a well-defined role in the transcriptional regulation of genes with associated G4 DNA-forming sequence motifs at their promoters. The consequence of the in vivo interaction between G4 DNA and nucleolin in respect to the genome instability has not been previously investigated. We show here that G4 DNA-binding is a conserved function in the yeast nucleolin Nsr1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Nsr1-G4 DNA complex formation results in replication obstruction and is a major factor in inducing the genome instability associated with the co-transcriptionally formed G4 DNA in the yeast genome. The G4-associated genome instability and the G4 DNA-binding in vivo requires the arginine-glycine-glycine (RGG) repeats located at the C-terminus of the Nsr1 protein. Nsr1 with the deletion of RGG domain supports normal cell growth and is sufficient for its pre-rRNA processing function. However, the truncation of RGG domain of Nsr1 significantly weakens its interaction with G4 DNA in vitro and in vivo and restores unhindered replication, overall resulting in a sharp reduction in the G4-associated genome instability. Our data suggest that the interaction between Nsr1 with the intact RGG repeats and G4 DNA impairs genome stability by precluding the access of G4-resolving proteins and obstructing replication.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYGenome instability is uniquely elevated at sequences containing multiple runs of guanines, which can fold into the unusual, four-stranded G-quadruplex (G4) DNA. In this study, we report a novel finding that a highly conserved G4 DNA binding protein Nsr1 can elevate the rate of recombination and chromosomal rearrangement occurring at a G4 DNA-forming sequence in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The elevated genome instability requires the C-terminally located RGG domain of Nsr1, which supports the high-affinity interaction between the protein and G4 DNA. The connection between G4-specific genome instability and the function of Nsr1 to form stable complex with G4 DNA led to the hypothesis that the high-affinity Nsr1-G4 DNA complexes can become a barrier to replication. We demonstrate here that the presence of Nsr1 in fact slows the replication past a G4 DNA-containing genomic site and that the RGG domain is required to facilitate such replication block.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state functional connectivity is used throughout neuroscience to study brain organization and to generate biomarkers of development, disease, and cognition. The processes that give rise to correlated activity are, however, poorly understood. Here, we decompose resting-state functional connectivity using a \"temporal unwrapping\" procedure to assess the contributions of moment-to-moment activity co-fluctuations to the overall connectivity pattern. This approach temporally resolves functional connectivity at a timescale of single frames, which enables us to make direct comparisons of co-fluctuations of network organization with fluctuations in the BOLD time series. We show that, surprisingly, only a small fraction of frames exhibiting the strongest co-fluctuation amplitude are required to explain a significant fraction of variance in the overall pattern of connection weights as well as the networks modular structure. These frames coincide with frames of high BOLD activity amplitude, corresponding to activity patterns that are remarkably consistent across individuals and identify fluctuations in default mode and control network activity as the primary driver of resting-state functional connectivity. Finally, we demonstrate that co-fluctuation amplitude synchronizes across subjects during movie-watching and that high-amplitude frames carry detailed information about individual subjects (whereas low-amplitude frames carry little). Our approach reveals fine-scale temporal structure of resting-state functional connectivity, and discloses that frame-wise contributions vary across time. These observations illuminate the relation of brain activity to functional connectivity and open a number of new directions for future research.",

    "abstract": "Memory schemas are higher-level knowledge structures that store an abstraction of multiple previous experiences. They allow us to retain a multitude of information without the cost of storing every detail. Schemas are believed to be relatively stable, but occasionally have to be updated to remain useful in the face of changing environmental conditions. Once a schema is consolidated, schema updating has been proposed to be the result of a prediction-error (PE) based learning mechanism, similar to the updating of less complex knowledge. However, for schema memory this hypothesis has been difficult to test because no sufficiently sensitive tools to track modifications to complex memory schemas existed so far. Current research on the updating of less complex beliefs and at much shorter time scales has identified the P3 as an electrophysiological correlate of PE-induced updating of beliefs. In this study, I recorded electroencephalography and continuous memory measures during the encoding of schema consistent vs. inconsistent material to test the behavioural and neural correlates of schema updating. I observed that PEs predicted the updating of a schema after a 24-hour delay, especially when participants were faced with inconsistent compared to consistent material. Moreover, the P3 amplitude tracked both the PE at the time of learning as well as the updating of the memory schema in the inconsistent condition. These results demonstrate that schema updating in the face of inconsistent information is driven by PE-based learning, and that similar neural mechanisms underlie the updating of consolidated long-term memory schemas and short-term belief structures.",

To demonstrate the utility of AtacWorks, we train a model on data from four human blood cell types and show that this model accurately denoises chromatin accessibility at base-pair resolution and identifies peaks from low-coverage bulk sequencing of unseen cell types and experimental conditions. We use the same framework to obtain high-quality results from as few as 50 aggregate single-cell ATAC-seq profiles, and also from data with a low signal-to-noise ratio. We further show that AtacWorks can be adapted for cross-modality prediction of transcription factor footprints and ChIP-seq peaks from low input ATAC-seq.

    "abstract": "Philornis flies are the major cause of myasis in altricial nestlings of neotropical birds. Its impact ranges from subtle to lethal, being of major concern in endangered bird species with geographically-restricted, fragmented and small-sized populations. In spite of its relevance for bird conservation, there is little information about the environmental dimensions determining their geographical range. We identified for the first time the macro-environmental variables constraining the abiotic niche of the P. torquans complex in South America, and provided a model map of its potential distribution based on environmental suitability. We used maximum entropy to model the ecological niche of the P. torquans complex, and to determine the contributing scenopoetic variables. We applied most of the recommendations to produce robust ecological niche models: accounting for sampling bias and spatial autocorrelation; using an accessible area for model calibration; testing multiple combinations of model parameters; using multiple statistical criteria; using a number of model replicates to determine consistency and uncertainty in geographical predictions. We identified the minimum temperature of the coldest month as the most relevant variable, associated with the largest decrease in habitat suitability in Brazil and northern South America. Furthermore, the mean temperature of the warmest quarter limited suitability mostly along the Andean range. In addition, humidity and moisture are influential factors in most of Argentina, northern Chile and coastal Peru. The geographical projection of the niche model suggests that environments in most of central-eastern Argentina, and in a broad area in central Chile, are suitable for the presence of the P. torquans complex. Besides of contributing to the knowledge of the ecology of the genus, this study is of relevance as a tool for bird conservation and represents a good reference for future work on the distribution of this parasite genus.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of antimicrobial resistance can be strongly affected by variations of antimicrobial concentration. Here, we study the impact of periodic alternations of absence and presence of antimicrobial on resistance evolution in a microbial population, using a stochastic model that includes variations of both population composition and size, and fully incorporates stochastic population extinctions. We show that fast alternations of presence and absence of antimicrobial are inefficient to eradicate the microbial population and strongly favor the establishment of resistance, unless the antimicrobial increases enough the death rate. We further demonstrate that if the period of alternations is longer than a threshold value, the microbial population goes extinct upon the first addition of antimicrobial, if it is not rescued by resistance. We express the probability that the population is eradicated upon the first addition of antimicrobial, assuming rare mutations. Rescue by resistance can happen either if resistant mutants preexist, or if they appear after antimicrobial is added to the environment. Importantly, the latter case is fully prevented by perfect biostatic antimicrobials that completely stop division of sensitive microorganisms. By contrast, we show that the parameter regime where treatment is efficient is larger for biocidal drugs than for biostatic drugs. This sheds light on the respective merits of different antimicrobial modes of action.\n\nAuthor summaryAntimicrobials select for resistance, which threatens to make antimicrobials useless. Understanding the evolution of antimicrobial resistance is therefore of crucial importance. Under what circumstances are microbial populations eradicated by antimicrobials? Conversely, when are they rescued by resistance? We address these questions employing a stochastic model that incorporates variations of both population composition and size. We consider periodic alternations of absence and presence of antimicrobial, which may model a treatment. We find a threshold period above which the first phase with antimicrobial fully determines the fate of the population. Faster alternations strongly select for resistance, and are inefficient to eradicate the microbial population, unless the death rate induced by the treatment is large enough. For longer alternation periods, we calculate the probability that the microbial population gets eradicated. We further demonstrate the different merits of biostatic antimicrobials, which prevent sensitive microbes from dividing, and of biocidal ones, which kill sensitive microbes.",

Prior to anaphase of budding yeast, the ribosomal DNA (RDN) condenses to a thin loop that is distinct from the rest of the chromosomes. We provide evidence that the establishment and maintenance of this RDN condensation require the regulation of condensin by Cdc5p (polo) kinase. We show that Cdc5p is recruited to the site of condensin binding in the RDN by cohesin, a complex related to condensin. Cdc5p and cohesin prevent condensin from misfolding the RDN into an irreversibly decondensed state. From these and other observations, we propose that the spatial regulation of Cdc5p by cohesin modulates condensin activity to ensure proper RDN folding into a thin loop. This mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved, promoting the thinly condensed constrictions that occur at centromeres and RDN of mitotic chromosomes in plants and animals.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenBank contains over 3 million viral sequences. The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) previously made available a tool for validating and annotating influenza virus sequences that is used to check submissions to GenBank. Before this project, there was no analogous tool in use for non-influenza viral sequence submissions.\n\nResultsWe developed a system called VADR (Viral Annotation DefineR) that validates and annotates viral sequences in GenBank submissions. The annotation system is based on the analysis of the input nucleotide sequence using models built from curated RefSeqs. Hidden Markov models are used to classify sequences by determining the RefSeq they are most similar to, and feature annotation from the RefSeq is mapped based on a nucleotide alignment of the full sequence to a covariance model. Predicted proteins encoded by the sequence are validated with nucleotide-to-protein alignments using BLAST. The system identifies 43 types of \"alerts\" that (unlike the previous BLAST-based system) provide deterministic and rigorous feedback to researchers who submit sequences with unexpected characteristics. VADR has been integrated into GenBanks submission processing pipeline allowing for viral submissions passing all tests to be accepted and annotated automatically, without the need for any human (GenBank indexer) intervention. Unlike the previous submission-checking system, VADR is freely available (https://github.com/nawrockie/vadr) for local installation and use. VADR has been used for Norovirus submissions since May 2018 and for Dengue virus submissions since January 2019. Other viruses with high numbers of submissions will be added incrementally.\n\nConclusionVADR improves the speed with which non-flu virus submissions to GenBank can be checked and improves the content and quality of the GenBank annotations. The availability and portability of the software allow researchers to run the GenBank checks prior to submitting their viral sequences, and thereby gain confidence that their submissions will be accepted immediately without the need to correspond with GenBank staff. Reciprocally, the adoption of VADR frees GenBank staff to spend more time on services other than checking routine viral sequence submissions.",

We applied genomic structure equation modeling to evaluate the genetic factor structure of two well-established impulsivity questionnaires, using published genome-wide association study statistics from up to 22,861 participants. We also tested the hypotheses that delay discounting would be genetically separable from other impulsivity factors, and that emotionally-triggered facets of impulsivity (urgency) would be those most strongly genetically correlated with an internalizing latent factor. A five-factor model best fit the impulsivity data. Delay discounting was genetically distinct from these five factors. As expected, the two urgency subscales were most strongly related to an Internalizing Psychopathology latent factor. These findings provide empirical genetic evidence that impulsivity can be disarticulated into distinct categories of differential relevance for internalizing psychopathology. They also demonstrate how measured genetic markers can be used to inform theories of psychology/personality.",

They provide us with behavioural data at scales and resolutions not possible with manual observations. Many automated methods are being developed to extract data from these high-resolution videos. However, the task of animal detection and tracking for videos taken in natural settings remains challenging due to heterogeneous environments.\nC_LIO_LIWe present an open-source end-to-end pipeline called Multi-Object Tracking in Heterogenous environments (MOTHe), a python-based application that uses a basic convolutional neural network for object detection. MOTHe allows researchers with minimal coding experience to track multiple animals in their natural habitats. It identifies animals even when individuals are stationary or partially camouflaged.\nC_LIO_LIMOTHe has a command-line-based interface with one command for each action, for example, finding animals in an image and tracking each individual. Parameters used by the algorithm are well described in a configuration file along with example values for different types of tracking scenario. MOTHe doesnt require any sophisticated infrastructure and can be run on basic desktop computing units.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate MOTHe on six video clips from two species in their natural habitat - wasp colonies on their nests (up to 12 individuals per colony) and antelope herds in four different types of habitats (up to 156 individuals in a herd). Using MOTHe, we are able to detect and track all individuals in these animal group videos. MOTHes computing time on a personal computer with 4 GB RAM and i5 processor is 5 minutes for a 30-second long ultra-HD (4K resolution) video recorded at 30 frames per second.\nC_LIO_LIMOTHe is available as an open-source repository with a detailed user guide and demonstrations at Github (https://github.com/tee-lab/MOTHe).\nC_LI",

We applied Compass to associate metabolic states with functional variability (pathogenic potential) amongst Th17 cells and recovered a metabolic switch between glycolysis and fatty acid oxidation, akin to known differences between Th17 and Treg cells, as well as novel targets in amino-acid pathways, which we tested through targeted metabolic assays. Compass further predicted a particular glycolytic reaction (phosphoglycerate mutase -- PGAM) that promotes an anti-inflammatory Th17 phenotype, contrary to the common understanding of glycolysis as pro-inflammatory. We demonstrate that PGAM inhibition leads non-pathogenic Th17 cells to adopt a pro-inflammatory transcriptome and induce autoimmunity in vivo.

    "abstract": "Nociceptive and pruriceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) convey sensations of pain and itch to the spinal cord, respectively. One subtype of mature DRG neurons, comprising about 5% of neurons in the ganglia, is responsible for sensing mediators of acute itch and atopic dermatitis, including the cytokine IL-31. How itch-sensitive (pruriceptive) neurons are specified is unclear. Here we show that Tmem184b, a gene with roles in axon degeneration and nerve terminal maintenance, is required for the expression of a large cohort of itch receptors, including those for IL-31, Leukotriene C4, and Histamine. Male and female mice lacking Tmem184b show reduced responses to IL-31, but maintain normal responses to pain and mechanical force, indicating a specific behavioral defect in pruriception. Calcium imaging experiments indicate that a reduction in IL-31 induced calcium entry is a likely contributor to this phenotype. We identify an early failure of proper Wnt-dependent transcriptional signatures and signaling components in Tmem184b mutant mice that may explain the improper DRG neuronal subtype specification. Accordingly, lentiviral re-expression of Tmem184b in mutant embryonic neurons restores Wnt signatures. Together, these data demonstrate that Tmem184b promotes adult somatosensation through developmental Wnt signaling and promotion of proper pruriceptive gene expression. Our data illuminate a new key regulatory step in the processes controlling the establishment of diversity in the somatosensory system.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic arrest and resumption in mammalian oocytes are regulated by two opposing signaling proteins in the cells of the surrounding follicle: the guanylyl cyclase NPR2, and the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR). NPR2 maintains a meiosis-inhibitory level of cyclic GMP (cGMP) until LHR signaling causes dephosphorylation of NPR2, reducing NPR2 activity, lowering cGMP to a level that releases meiotic arrest. However, the signaling pathway between LHR activation and NPR2 dephosphorylation remains incompletely understood, due in part to imprecise information about the cellular localization of these two proteins. To investigate their localization, we generated mouse lines in which HA epitope tags were added to the endogenous LHR and NPR2 proteins, and used immunofluorescence and immunogold microscopy to localize these proteins with high resolution. The results showed that the LHR protein is absent from the cumulus cells and inner mural granulosa cells, and is present in only 13-48% of the outer mural granulosa cells. In contrast, NPR2 is present throughout the follicle, and is more concentrated in the cumulus cells. Less than 20% of the NPR2 is in the same cells that express the LHR. These results suggest that to account for the LH-induced inactivation of NPR2, LHR-expressing cells send a signal that inactivates NPR2 in neighboring cells that do not express the LHR. An inhibitor of gap junction permeability attenuates the LH-induced cGMP decrease in the outer mural granulosa cells, consistent with this mechanism contributing to how NPR2 is inactivated in cells that do not express the LHR.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer is a highly heterogenous, metastatic and lethal disease. The presence of CD8+T cells within ovarian tumors is positively associated with overall patient survival. Determining if a patient has T cells that respond to immunotherapies, their characteristics and how they can be manipulated to target cancer cells is an area of intense investigation in cancer therapy. This study determines the cellular composition and the transcriptional state of immune cells in metastatic ovarian cancer samples from patients using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Hierarchical clustering stratified our patient cohort into 2 main groups: 1) a high T cell infiltration (high Tinf) group and 2) a low T cell infiltration (low Tinf) group. To assess the immune response in these patient samples, we performed an unsupervised clustering of the T cell population in each group. The T cell population clustered into 4 and 3 subpopulations in the high Tinf T cell and low Tinf respectively. A granulysin expressing T cell cluster was identified and unique to the High Tinf group. Interestingly, although both groups had resident memory CD8+T (CD8+Trm) cells, only the CD8+Trm cells in the high Tinf group expressed TOX, a recently described transcription factor. TOX confers longevity to T cells within immunosuppressive environment such as cancer. Interestingly, along with TOX+ T cells, we found a unique plasmablast cluster and an IRF8+ macrophage cluster unique to the high Tinf group. Our comprehensive scRNA-seq study provides important insights in elucidating the immune response in ovarian cancer patients.",

The Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) has established a clear and precise XML representation for data interchange, mzML, receiving substantial uptake; nevertheless, storage and file access efficiency has not been the main focus. We propose an HDF5 file format  mzMLb that is optimised for both read/write speed and storage of the raw mass spectrometry data. We provide extensive validation of write speed, random read speed and storage size, demonstrating a flexible format that with or without compression is faster than all existing approaches in virtually all cases, while with compression, is comparable in size to proprietary vendor file formats. Since our approach uniquely preserves the XML encoding of the metadata, the format implicitly supports future versions of mzML and is straightforward to implement: mzMLbs design adheres to both HDF5 and NetCDF4 standard implementations, which allows it to be easily utilised by third parties due to their widespread programming language support. A reference implementation within the established ProteoWizard toolkit is provided.",

These structurally robust organelles experience strenuous cellular processes such as cell division or ciliary beating while performing their function. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the stability of microtubule triplets, as well as centriole architectural integrity remain poorly understood. Here, using ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) for nanoscale protein mapping, we reveal that POC16 and its human homolog WDR90 are components of the centriolar microtubule wall along the central core region of the centriole. We further found that WDR90 is an evolutionary microtubule associated protein with a predicted structurally homology with the ciliary inner junction protein FAP20. Finally, we demonstrate that WDR90 depletion impairs the localization of inner scaffold components, leading to centriole structural abnormalities in both human and Chlamydomonas cells. Altogether, this work highlights that POC16/WDR90 is a crucial evolutionary conserved molecular player participating in centriole architecture integrity.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental health disorder worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 5-7% of the human population. Although the etiology of anxiety disorders is incompletely understood, one aspect of host health that affects anxiety disorders is the gut-brain axis. We used a mouse model of gastrointestinal (GI) colonization to demonstrate that the commensal fungus Candida albicans affects host health via the gut-brain axis. In mice, bacterial members of the gut microbiota can influence the host gut-brain axis, affecting anxiety-like behavior and the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis which produces the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT). Here we showed that mice colonized with C. albicans demonstrated increased anxiety-like behavior and increased basal production of CORT as well as dysregulation of CORT production following acute stress. The HPA axis and anxiety-like behavior are negatively regulated by the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA). C. albicans-colonized mice exhibited systemic changes in the endocannabinoidome, within the GI tract and the brain, and showed a negative correlation between brain AEA levels and serum CORT. Further, increasing AEA levels using the well-characterized fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor URB597 was sufficient to reverse both neuroendocrine phenotypes in C. albicans-colonized mice. Thus, a commensal fungus that is a common colonizer of humans had widespread effects on the physiology of its host. To our knowledge, this is the first report of microbial manipulation of the endocannabinoid (eCB) system that resulted in neuroendocrine changes contributing to anxiety-like behavior.",

Here, the SSRs were analyzed in 55 randomly selected segments of genomes from a fairly wide range of species, with introducing more open standard for extensively mining repeats. A high percentage of repeats were discovered in these segments, which is inconsistent with the current theory suggested that repeats tend to disappear over long-term evolution. Therefore, a mechanism is most probably responsible for continually producing repeats during replication to balance continuous repeat disappearance, which may makes the replicating process relatively semi-conservative. To improve the current straight-line slippage model, we proposed a folded slippage model involving the geometric space of nucleotides and hydrogen bond stability to explain the high-percent SSR occurrence, which can describe SSR expansion and contraction more reasonably. And analysis of external forces in the folding template strands suggested that the microsatellites tend to expand than contract. Our research may provide implements for contributions of microsatellites to genome evolution and complement semi-conservative replication.",

    "abstract": "Flexible behavior requires restraint or cancellation of actions that are no longer appropriate. This behavioral inhibition critically relies on frontal cortex - basal ganglia circuits. A central node within the basal ganglia, the globus pallidus pars externa (GPe), has been hypothesized to mediate \"proactive\" inhibition: being prepared to stop an action if needed. Here we investigate the population dynamics of rat GPe neurons during preparation-to-stop, stopping, and going. Rats could selectively engage proactive inhibition towards one specific action, as shown by slowed reaction times (RTs) for that action. While proactive inhibition was engaged, GPe population activity occupied state-space locations farther from the trajectory followed during normal movement initiation. Furthermore, the specific state-space location was predictive of distinct types of errors: failures to stop, failures to go, and incorrect choices. The slowed RTs on correct proactive trials reflected a starting bias towards the alternative action, which was overcome before making progress towards action initiation. Our results demonstrate that rats can exert cognitive control via strategic positioning of their GPe network state.",

    "abstract": "Initiation and progression of cancers reflect the underlying process of somatic evolution, which follows a Darwinian logic, i.e., diversification of heritable phenotypes provides a substrate for natural selection, resulting in the outgrowth of the most fit subpopulations. Although somatic evolution can tap into multiple sources of diversification, it is assumed to lack access to (para)sexual recombination - a key diversification mechanism throughout all strata of life. Based on observations of spontaneous fusions involving cancer cells, reported genetic instability of polypoid cells, and precedence of fusion-mediated parasexual recombination in fungi, we asked whether cell fusions could serve as a source of parasexual recombination in cancer cell populations. Using differentially labelled tumor cells, we found evidence of low-frequency, spontaneous cell fusions between carcinoma cells in multiple cell line models of breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. While some hybrids remained polyploid, many displayed partial ploidy reduction, generating diverse progeny with heterogeneous inheritance of parental alleles, indicative of partial recombination. Hybrid cells also displayed elevated levels of phenotypic plasticity, which may further amplify the impact of cell fusions on the diversification of phenotypic traits. Using mathematical modeling, we demonstrated that the observed rates of spontaneous somatic cell fusions may enable populations of tumor cells to amplify clonal heterogeneity, thus facilitating the exploration of larger areas of the adaptive landscape, relative to strictly asexual populations, which may substantially accelerate a tumors ability to adapt to new selective pressures.",

Diagnosis of COVID-19 is currently performed by RT-qPCR methods, but the capacity of RT-qPCR methods is limited by its requirement of high-level facilities and instruments. Here, we developed and evaluated RT-LAMP assays to detect genomic RNA of SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19. RT-LAMP assays in this study can detect as low as 100 copies of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Cross-reactivity of RT-LAMP assays to other human Coronaviruses was not observed.

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryThe prokaryotic chemotaxis system is arguably the best-understood signaling pathway in biology, but most insights have been obtained from only a few model organisms and many studies have relied on artificial systems that alter membrane curvature1-3. In all previously described species, chemoreceptors organize with the histidine kinase (CheA) and coupling protein (CheW) into a hexagonal (P6 symmetry) extended array that is considered universal among archaea and bacteria4,5. Here, for the first time, we report an alternative symmetry (P2) of the chemotaxis apparatus that emerges from a strict linear organization of CheA in Treponema denticola cells, which possesses arrays with the highest native curvature investigated thus far. Using cryo-ET, we reveal that the Td chemoreceptor arrays assume a truly unusual arrangement of the supra-molecular protein assembly that has likely evolved to accommodate the high membrane curvature. The arrays have several additional atypical features, such as an extended dimerization domain of CheA and a variant CheW-CheR-like fusion protein that is critical for maintaining an ordered chemosensory apparatus in an extremely curved cell. Furthermore, the previously characterized Td oxygen sensor ODP influences array integrity and its loss substantially orders CheA. These results suggest a greater diversity of the chemotaxis signaling system than previously thought and demonstrate the importance of examining transmembrane systems in vivo to retain native membrane curvature.",

    "abstract": "The effects of real-world stimuli and how they vary across individuals remains largely unknown for lack of a continuous real-world circadian marker. Here, we show how an underlying circadian rhythm in heart rate (CRHR) can be extracted from several widely used wearables. Analysis of over 130,000 days of data from medical interns on rotating shifts shows how CRHR dynamics are distinct from those of sleep-wake timing and vary greatly among individuals. Analysis of circadian timekeeping in travelers in 5 continents shows how the circadian timekeeping more carefully controls wake time rather than sleep time. We determine a personalized phase response curve (PRC) of CRHR to activity for each individual, representing the first passive and personalized determination of how human circadian timekeeping continuously changes due to real-world stimuli. These results collectively establish CRHR as a practical method to study circadian rhythms in the real world.\n\neTOC BlurbWe show how the circadian rhythm in heart rate can be extracted from real world data collected by wearables. Studying data from a large cohort of medical interns working on shifts, we find very interesting dynamics of this circadian rhythm that are independent of the acute effects of activity or sleep-wake timing.

    "abstract": "Eukaryotes have evolved various quality control mechanisms to promote proteostasis in the ER. Selective removal of certain ER domains via autophagy (termed as ER-phagy) has emerged as a major quality control mechanism. However, the degree to which ER-phagy is employed by other branches of ER-quality control remains largely elusive. Here, we identify a cytosolic protein, C53, that is specifically recruited to autophagosomes during ER-stress, in both plant and mammalian cells. C53 interacts with ATG8 via a distinct binding epitope, featuring a shuffled ATG8 interacting motif (sAIM). C53 senses proteotoxic stress in the ER lumen by forming a tripartite receptor complex with the ER-associated ufmylation ligase UFL1 and its membrane adaptor DDRGK1. The C53/UFL1/DDRGK1 receptor complex is activated by stalled ribosomes and induces the degradation of internal or passenger proteins in the ER. Consistently, the C53 receptor complex and ufmylation mutants are highly susceptible to ER stress. Thus, C53 forms an ancient quality control pathway that bridges selective autophagy with ribosome-associated quality control at the ER.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence shows that cells are able to sense and store a memory of their past mechanical environment. Since existing mechanotransduction models are based on adhesion and cytoskeletal dynamics that occurs over seconds and minutes, they do not capture memory observed over days or weeks. We postulate that transcriptional activity and epigenetic plasticity, upstream of adhesion-based signaling, need to be invoked to explain long-term mechanical memory. Here, we present a theory for mechanical memory in cells governed by three key components. First, cells on a stiff matrix are primed by a transcriptional reinforcement of cytoskeletal signaling. Second, longer stiff-priming progressively produces more memory-regulating factors and reduces epigenetic plasticity. Third, when stiff-primed cells move to soft matrix, the reduced epigenetic plasticity blocks new transcription required for cellular adaptation to the new matrix. This stalled transcriptional state gives rise to memory. We validate this model against previous experimental findings of memory storage and decay in epithelial cell migration and stem cell differentiation. We also predict wide-ranging memory responses for different cell types of varying protein kinetics and priming conditions. This theoretical framework for mechanical memory expands the timescales of mechanotransduction captured by conventional models by integrating cytoskeletal signaling with transcriptional activity and epigenetic plasticity. Our model predictions explain mechanical memory and propose new experiments to test spatiotemporal regulation of cellular memory in diverse contexts ranging from cell differentiation to migration and growth.",

We show evidence of strong purifying selection around the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the spike gene and in other genes among bat, pangolin and human coronaviruses, indicating similar strong evolutionary constraints in different host species. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2s entire RBM was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins, possibly a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2s ability to infect humans. Similar purifying selection in different host species and frequent recombination among coronaviruses suggest a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryExtensive Recombination and Strong Purifying Selection among coronaviruses from different hosts facilitate the emergence of SARS-CoV-2",

    "abstract": "To create new enzymes and biosensors from scratch, precise control over the structure of small molecule binding sites is of paramount importance, but systematically designing arbitrary protein pocket shapes and sizes remains an outstanding challenge. Using the NTF2-like structural superfamily as a model system, we developed a generative algorithm for creating a virtually unlimited number of de novo proteins supporting diverse pocket structures. The generative algorithm was tested and refined through feedback from two rounds of large scale experimental testing, involving in total, the assembly of synthetic genes encoding 7896 generated designs and assessment of their stability on the yeast cell surface, detailed biophysical characterization of 64 designs, and crystal structures of 5 designs. The refined algorithm generates proteins that remain folded at high temperatures and exhibit more pocket diversity than naturally occurring NTF2-like proteins. We expect this approach to transform the design of small molecule sensors and enzymes by enabling the creation of binding and active site geometries much more optimal for specific design challenges than is accessible by repurposing the limited number of naturally occurring NTF2-like proteins.",

Here, we measured proteomics data for Saccharomyces cerevisiae with both biological and inter-batch technical triplicates, to analyze both accuracy and precision of protein quantification via MS. Moreover, we analyzed how these metrics vary when applying different methods for converting MS intensities to absolute protein abundances. We found that a simple normalization and rescaling approach performs as accurately yet more precisely than methods that rely on external standards. Additionally, we show that inter-batch reproducibility is worse than biological reproducibility for all evaluated methods.

    "abstract": "RNA splicing is widely dysregulated in cancer, frequently due to altered expression or activity of splicing factors. Microexons are extremely small exons (3-27 nucleotides long) that are highly evolutionarily conserved and play critical roles in promoting neuronal differentiation and development. Inclusion of microexons in mRNA transcripts is mediated by the splicing factor SRRM4, whose expression is largely restricted to neural tissues. However, microexons have been largely overlooked in prior analyses of splicing in cancer, as their small size necessitates specialized computational approaches for their detection. Here we demonstrate that despite having low expression in normal non-neural tissues, SRRM4 is hypersilenced in tumors, resulting in the suppression of basal microexon inclusion. Remarkably, SRRM4 is the most consistently silenced splicing factor across all tumor types analyzed, implying a general advantage of microexon downregulation in cancer independent of its tissue of origin. We show that this silencing is favorable for tumor growth, as decreased SRRM4 expression in tumors is correlated with an increase in mitotic gene expression, and upregulation of SRRM4 in cancer cell lines dose-dependently inhibits proliferation in vitro and in a mouse xenograft model. Further, this proliferation inhibition is accompanied by induction of neural-like expression and splicing patterns in cancer cells, suggesting that SRRM4 expression shifts the cell state away from proliferation and towards differentiation. We therefore conclude that SRRM4 acts as a proliferation brake, and tumors gain a selective advantage by cutting off this brake.\n\nSignificanceMicroexons are extremely small exons enriched in the brain that play important roles in neural development. Their inclusion is mediated by the splicing factor SRRM4, also predominantly expressed in the brain. Surprisingly, we find that low expression of SRRM4 outside of the brain is further decreased in tumors, and in fact SRRM4 is the most consistently silenced splicing factor in tumors across tissue types. We demonstrate that SRRM4 inhibits cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo by inducing a neuronal differentiation program. Our findings add a new element to the overall picture of splicing dysregulation in cancer, reveal an antiproliferative function for SRRM4 and microexons outside of the brain, and may present a common therapeutic intervention point across cancer types.",

    "abstract": "TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers. In Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Clonal Hematopoiesis of Indeterminate Potential (CHIP), it is one of several recurrent genetic alterations. Despite multiple recent therapeutic advances for AML, TP53 mutated AML is associated with resistance to currently approved therapies and thus, a very poor prognosis. Emerging evidence suggests that mutations in TP53 may be a predictor of positive response to immunotherapy. To model cell - extrinsic consequences of hematopoietic p53 loss, we generated bone marrow chimeric mice bearing p53-/- and congenic wild type cells. Following reconstitution, we observed increased levels of wild type CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in mice transplanted with p53-/- hematopoietic cells compared to controls. In addition, we observed a change in the frequency of T cell subsets in p53-/- chimeras including an increase in Tregs. To determine if these alterations were mirrored in the leukemic setting, we next generated p53-/-;nRasG12D leukemia. While the bone marrow of p53-/-;nRasG12D leukemia showed the presence of both T and B lymphocytes, MLL-AF9 showed a near complete absence of lymphocytes, akin to  immune-infiltrated and  immune-desert phenotypes seen in solid tumors. These data clearly demonstrate a causal cell-extrinsic effect of hematopoietic p53 loss on the immune system, both in the context of leukemia and preleukemic states. Modeling AML genetics in murine models serves as a powerful tool to define the association between genetic drivers and immune subtypes of AML towards precise patient stratification critical for the application of emerging targeted and immune therapies.\n\nStatement of SignificanceTP53 mutations are frequent in both AML and CHIP, and are associated with both resistance to therapy as well as very poor prognosis.

RAS-dependent signaling is a major nexus controlling essential cell parameters including proliferation, survival and migration, utilizing downstream effectors such as the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. In melanoma, oncogenic mutations frequently enhance RAS, PI3K/AKT or MAP kinase signaling, and trigger other cancer hallmarks among which the activation of metabolism regulators. PFKFB4 is one of these critical regulators of glycolysis and of the Warburg effect. Here however, we explore a novel function of PFKFB4 in melanoma cell migration. We find that PFKFB4 interacts with ICMT, a post-translational modifier of RAS. PFKFB4 promotes ICMT/RAS interaction, controls RAS localization at the plasma membrane, activates AKT signaling and enhances cell migration. We thus provide evidence of a novel and glycolysis-independent function of PFKFB4 in human cancer cells. This unconventional activity links the metabolic regulator PFKFB4 to RAS-AKT signaling and impacts melanoma cell migration.\n\nHighlights- PFKFB4, a known regulator of glycolysis, also displays an unconventional role in melanoma cell migration.\n- PFKFB4 interacts with ICMT and promotes RAS localization at the plasma membrane.\n- PFKFB4 and ICMT cooperation modulates AKT signaling and controls melanoma cell migration.",

Using sparse random recombination, we show that mosaic gene dosage manipulation of the transcription factor Brn3a/Pou4f1 in neurotrophic receptor Ret heterozygote RGCs results in altered cell fate decisions and/or morphological dendritic defects. Specific RGC types are lost if Brn3a is ablated during embryogenesis and only mildly affected by postnatal Brn3a ablation. Sparse but not complete Brn3a heterozygosity combined with complete Ret heterozygosity has striking effects on RGC type distribution. Brn3a only mildly modulates Ret transcription, while Ret knockouts exhibit normal Brn3a and Brn3b expression. However, Brn3a loss of function significantly affects distribution of Ret co-receptors GFR1-3, and neurotrophin receptors TrkA and TrkC in RGCs. Based on these observations, we propose that Brn3a and Ret converge onto developmental pathways that control RGC type specification, potentially through a competitive mechanism requiring signaling from the surrounding tissue.",

    "abstract": "The ventricular conduction system coordinates heartbeats by rapid propagation of electrical activity through the Purkinje fiber (PF) network. PFs share common progenitors with contractile cardiomyocytes, yet the mechanisms of segregation and network morphogenesis are poorly understood. In this study, we apply genetic fate mapping and temporal clonal analysis to identify cardiomyocytes committed to the PF lineage as early as E7.5. We find that a polyclonal PF network emerges by progressive recruitment of conductive precursors to this scaffold from a pool of bipotent progenitors. At late fetal stages, the segregation of conductive cells increases during a phase of rapid recruitment to build the definitive PF network through a non-cell autonomous mechanism. We also show that PF differentiation is impaired in Nkx2-5 haploinsufficient embryos leading to failure to extend the scaffold. In particular, late fetal recruitment fails, resulting in PF hypoplasia and persistence of bipotent progenitors. Our results identify how transcription factor dosage regulates cell fate divergence during distinct phases of PF network morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The Myostatin/Activin branch of the TGF{beta} superfamily acts as a negative regulator of mammalian skeletal muscle size, in part, through downregulation of insulin/IGF-1 signaling. Surprisingly, recent studies in Drosophila indicate that Activin signaling acts as a positive regulator of muscle size. Here we demonstrate that Drosophila Activin signaling promotes growth of the muscle cells along all three axes; width, length and thickness. In addition, Activin signaling positively regulates the InR/dTORC1 pathway and the level of MHC, an essential sarcomeric protein, via promoting the transcription of Pdk1 and Akt1. Enhancing InR/dTORC1 signaling in the muscle of Activin pathway mutants restores MHC levels close to wild-type, but only increased the width of muscle cells. In contrast, hyperactivation of the Activin pathway increases the length of muscle cells even when MHC levels were lowered by suppression of dTORC1. Together, these results indicate that Drosophila Activin pathway regulates larval muscle geometry via promoting InR/dTORC1-dependent MHC production and the differential assembly of sarcomeric components into either pre-existing (width) or new (length) sarcomeric units depending on the balance of InR/dTORC1 and Activin signals.",

    "abstract": "Sex-biased gene expression patterns in animals are generally controlled by the somatic sex-determination hierarchies. How the different tiers of these hierarchies act on sexually dimorphic gene regulation is still poorly understood. In the developing Drosophila biarmipes wing, the X-linked gene yellow is expressed in males in a specific distal spot pattern that prefigures a corresponding adult pigmentation pattern. This yellow expression pattern is controlled by the spot enhancer, but the origin of yellow sexually dimorphic expression is unknown. Here we find that the functional interaction between homologous yellow alleles silences specifically the spot enhancer, which is therefore active in males (XY) but not in females (XX). We show that inserting yellow at homologous positions on autosomes recapitulates, in either sex, the homologous-dependent silencing of the spot enhancer. We further find that this silencing requires the yellow intron as well as the architectural protein Mod(mdg4). Finally, we show that Mod(mdg4) is also necessary for the sex-biased expression of some X-linked genes in the brain. Our results demonstrate that regulatory interactions between X-linked homologous alleles promote their sex-biased expression, independently of the canonical sex-determination hierarchy. More generally, they illustrate the biological significance of homologous chromosome pairing and trans-homolog interactions for the sexually dimorphic regulation of X-linked genes.",

New approaches to generate physiologically and pathologically relevant pulsatile flows are needed to understand EC behavior under different shear stress regimes. Here, we demonstrate an adaptable pump (Adapt-Pump) platform for generating pulsatile flows via quantitative imaging of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac spheroids (CS). Pulsatile flows generated from the Adapt-Pump system can recapitulate unique CS contraction characteristics, accurately model responses to clinically relevant drugs, and simulate CS contraction changes in response to fluidic mechanical stimulation. We discovered that ECs differentiated under a long QT syndrome derived pathological pulsatile flow exhibit abnormal EC monolayer organization. This Adapt-Pump platform provides a powerful tool for modeling the cardiovascular system and improving our understanding of EC behavior under different mechanical microenvironments.",

In Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, the piRNA pathway also contributes to gene regulation in somatic tissues, illustrating additional roles for piRNAs and PIWI proteins besides transposon repression. Here, we identify a highly abundant endogenous piRNA (propiR1) that associates with both Piwi4 and Piwi5. PropiR1-mediated target silencing requires base pairing in the seed region with supplemental base pairing at the piRNA 3 end. Yet, propiR1 represses a limited set of targets, among which the lncRNA AAEL027353 (lnc027353). Slicing of lnc027353 initiates production of responder and trailer piRNAs from the cleavage fragment. Expression of propiR1 commences early during embryonic development and mediates degradation of maternally provided lnc027353. Both propiR1 and its lncRNA target are conserved in the closely related Aedes albopictus mosquito, underscoring the importance of this regulatory network for mosquito development.",

    "abstract": "Gene-deficient mouse models are indispensable for interrogating mammalian gene functions, but the conventional models allow the study of only one or few genes per mouse line, which has been a bottleneck in functional genomics. To confront the challenge, we have combined the CRISPR-Cas and Cre-Lox systems to develop a novel type of mosaic mice termed MARC (Mosaic Animal based on gRNA and Cre) for targeting many genes per mouse but only one gene per cell. This technology employs a transgene comprising a modified U6 promoter upstream of a series of floxed gRNA genes linked together in tandem, with one gRNA expressed per cell following Cre-mediated recombination. At least 61 gRNA genes can be stably maintained in the transgene, and importantly, enables robust proof-of-principle in vivo screens, demonstrating the potential for quickly evaluating the functions of many genes in diverse tissues in a single MARC line. In theory, MARC can also be analyzed by single-cell sequencing, and should enable cost-effective derivation of conventional single-gene-KO lines via simple breeding. Our study establishes MARC as an important addition to the mouse genetics toolbox.",

Recent results challenge these observations since null bigH1 mutations generated by CRISPR/Cas9 methodology turn out to be homozygous viable, as reported in Li et al. (2019) and here.

    "abstract": "Timing and its variability are crucial for behavior. Consequently, neural circuits that take part in the control of timing and in the measurement of temporal intervals have been the subject of much research. Here, we provide an analytical and computational account of the temporal variability in what is perhaps the most basic model of a timing circuit, the synfire chain. First, we study the statistical structure of trial-to-trial timing variability in a reduced but analytically tractable model: a chain of single integrate-and-fire neurons. We show that this circuits variability is well-described by a generative model consisting of local, global, and jitter components. We relate each of these components to distinct neural mechanisms in the model. Next, we establish in simulations that these results carry over to a noisy homogeneous synfire chain. Finally, motivated by the fact that a synfire chain is thought to underlie the circuit that takes part in the control and timing of zebra finch song, we present simulations of a biologically realistic synfire chain model of the zebra finch timekeeping circuit. We find the structure of trial-to-trial timing variability to be consistent with our previous findings, and to agree with experimental observations of the songs temporal variability. Our study therefore provides a possible neuronal account of behavioral variability in zebra finches.",

    "abstract": "Purpose To develop a digital algorithm and validate a semi-quantitative scoring method for surface methylene blue (MB) staining in whole lymph nodes (LN).Methods Lymph nodes from canine models undergoing sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping were prospectively assessed ex vivo and photographed. Two blinded observers evaluated all images and assigned a semi-quantitative score based on surface staining (0 \u2013 no blue stain, 1 \u2013 1-50% stained, 2 \u2013 51-100% stained). A standard reference for degree of blue staining was based on signal-to-background ratios using computer-based imaging software with an output measurement of percentage of staining of the LN. Agreement between observers was assessed using the Kappa coefficient.Results 124 lymph nodes were included and demonstrated strong agreement (K = 0.8007, p &lt; 0.0001) between results of semi-quantitative scoring and image analysis. Also, strong interobserver and intraobserver agreement was observed for the scoring system (K = 0.8051, p &lt; 0.0001 and K = 0.9493, p &lt; 0.0001, respectively).Discussion Agreement between the observer-based scoring system and imaging software illustrates a validated method in assessing MB staining, without the need for analysis software. The use of a semi-quantitative scoring system shows promise for a simple, objective assessment of MB staining in surgery and for future study. Lymph nodes can have variable surface colour, which can make assessment of blue staining challenging for novice observers in certain cases. This study describes a digital algorithm for quantitative analysis of blue staining in LN thereby providing a novel and objective reporting mechanism in scientific research involving SLN mapping.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",

    "abstract": "Metabolic networks are known to deal with the chemical reactions responsible to fuel cellular activities with energy and carbon source and, as a matter of fact, to set the growth rate of the cell. To this end, feedback and regulatory networks play a crucial role to handle adaptation to external perturbations and internal noise. In this work, a cellular resource is assumed to be activated at the end of a metabolic pathway, by means of a cascade of transformations. Such a cascade is triggered by the catalytic action of an enzyme that promotes the first transformation. The final product is responsible for the cellular growth rate modulation. This mechanism acts in feedback at the enzymatic level, since the enzyme (as well as all species) is subject to dilution, with the dilution rate set by growth. Enzymatic production is modeled by the occurrence of noisy bursts: a Stochastic Hybrid System is exploited to model the network and to investigate how such noise propagates on growth fluctuations. A major biological finding is that, differently from other models of metabolic pathways disregarding growth-mediated feedback, fluctuations in enzyme levels do not produce only local effects, but propagate up to the final product (hence to the growth rate). Furthermore, the delay provided by the cascade length helps in reducing the impact of enzymatic noise on to growth fluctuations. Analytical results are supported by Monte Carlo simulations.",

Hypothalamic neuronal circuits are disrupted upon overfeeding, and play a role in the development of metabolic disorders. While mouse models have been extensively employed for understanding mechanisms of hypothalamic dysfunction, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) on hypothalamic nuclei has been challenging. We implemented a robust glucose-induced fMRI paradigm that allows to repeatedly investigate hypothalamic responses to glucose. This approach was used to test the hypothesis that hypothalamic nuclei functioning is impaired in mice exposed to a high-fat and high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) for 7 days. The blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal was measured from brains of mice under light isoflurane anaesthesia, during which a 2.6 g/kg glucose load was administered. The mouse hypothalamus responded to glucose but not saline administration with a biphasic BOLD fMRI signal reduction. Relative to controls, HFHSD-fed mice showed attenuated or blunted responses in arcuate nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, ventromedial nucleus and dorsomedial nucleus, but not in paraventricular nucleus. In sum, we have developed an fMRI paradigm that is able to determine dysfunction of glucose-sensing neuronal circuits within the mouse hypothalamus in a non-invasive manner.",

In the last century alone, we have observed four major influenza A virus pandemics as well as the emergence of three highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As no effective antiviral treatments or vaccines are presently available against SARS-CoV-2, it is important to understand the host response to this virus as this may guide the efforts in development towards novel therapeutics. Here, we offer the first in-depth characterization of the host transcriptional response to SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo model systems. Our data demonstrate the each virus elicits both core antiviral components as well as unique transcriptional footprints. Compared to the response to influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, SARS-CoV-2 elicits a muted response that lacks robust induction of a subset of cytokines including the Type I and Type III interferons as well as a numerous chemokines. Taken together, these data suggest that the unique transcriptional signature of this virus may be responsible for the development of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Direct RNA sequencing using an Oxford Nanopore MinION characterised the transcriptome of SARS-CoV-2 grown in Vero E6 cells. This cell line is being widely used to propagate the novel coronavirus. The viral transcriptome was analysed using a recently developed ORF-centric pipeline. This revealed the pattern of viral transcripts, (i.e. subgenomic mRNAs), generally fitted the predicted replication and transcription model for coronaviruses. A 24 nt in-frame deletion was detected in subgenomic mRNAs encoding the spike (S) glycoprotein. This feature was identified in over half of the mapped transcripts and was predicted to remove a proposed furin cleavage site from the S glycoprotein. This motif directs cleavage of the S glycoprotein into functional subunits during virus entry or exit. Cleavage of the S glycoprotein can be a barrier to zoonotic coronavirus transmission and affect viral pathogenicity. Allied to this transcriptome analysis, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify over 500 viral peptides and 44 phosphopeptides, covering almost all of the proteins predicted to be encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome, including peptides unique to the deleted variant of the S glycoprotein. Detection of an apparently viable deletion in the furin cleavage site of the S glycoprotein reinforces the point that this and other regions of SARS-CoV-2 proteins may readily mutate. This is of clear significance given the interest in the S glycoprotein as a potential vaccine target and the observation that the furin cleavage site likely contributes strongly to the pathogenesis and zoonosis of this virus. The viral genome sequence should be carefully monitored during the growth of viral stocks for research, animal challenge models and, potentially, in clinical samples. Such variations may result in different levels of virulence, morbidity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Recently, CRISPR-Cas technology has opened a new era of nucleic acid-based molecular diagnostics. However, current CRISPR-Cas-based nucleic acid biosensing has largely a lack of the quantitative detection ability and typically requires separate manual operations. Herein, we reported a dynamic aqueous multiphase reaction (DAMR) system for simple, sensitive and quantitative one-pot CRISPR-Cas12a based molecular diagnosis by taking advantage of density difference of sucrose concentration. In the DAMR system, recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and CRISPR-Cas12a derived fluorescent detection occurred in spatially separated but connected aqueous phases. Our DAMR system was utilized to quantitatively detect human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 and 18 DNAs with sensitivities of 10 and 100 copies within less than one hour. Multiplex detection of HPV16/18 in clinical human swab samples were successfully achieved in the DAMR system using 3D-printed microfluidic device. Furthermore, we demonstrated that target DNA in real human plasma samples can be directly amplified and detected in the DAMR system without complicated sample pre-treatment. As demonstrated, the DAMR system has shown great potential for development of next-generation point-of-care molecular diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "Although It is widely recognized that virtually all antidepressants (ADs) suppress rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the effects of chronic AD treatments on sleep abnormalities, especially those of REM sleep, have rarely been investigated comprehensively in animal models of major depressive disorder (MDD). Here, we show that chronic social defeat stress (SDS) in rats induces prolonged social avoidance and MDD-like alterations in sleep architecture (increased REM sleep durations, bouts, and shortened REM latency) even a month after the last SDS. These abnormalities were associated with changes in electroencephalography (EEG) spectra powers, such as reduced REM sleep theta powers during the light phase. Chronic AD treatments significantly ameliorated these behavioral, sleep, and EEG abnormalities, although in some cases not to control levels. Interestingly, the social interaction ratios a month after the last SDS most strongly correlated with the REM sleep theta powers. These results suggest that chronic AD treatments suppress REM sleep durations and bouts as observed in human MDD patients, but, at the same time, increase REM sleep theta power. The latter is an EEG parameter that has never been directly investigated in humans, and which may be responsible for the therapeutic effects of ADs.\n\nSignificance StatementDisturbed sleep is one of nine diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD), which usually resolves with adequate treatment. However, little is known about how antidepressants (AD) work in MDD animal models. Here, we developed a novel rat social defeat stress model demonstrating long-lasting MDD-like sleep disturbances. We found that chronic AD treatments suppressed REM durations and bouts as reported previously, but, at the same time, increased REM sleep theta power. Interestingly, among several sleep parameters, only REM sleep theta power strongly correlated with depressive symptoms at 1M. Thus, REM sleep theta power, an EEG parameter that has never been investigated directly in humans, could be a novel indicator for MDD and/or AD effects.",

    "abstract": "Image registration involves finding the best alignment between different images of the same object. In these tasks, the object in question is viewed differently in each of the images (e.g. different rotation or light conditions, etc.). In digital pathology, image registration aligns correspondent regions of tissue from different stereotactic viewpoints (e.g. subsequent deeper sections of the same tissue). These comparisons are important for histological analysis and can facilitate previously unavailable manipulations, such as 3D tissue reconstruction and cell-level alignment of immunohistochemical (IHC) and special stains. Several benchmarks have been established for evaluating image registration techniques for histological tissue; however, little work has evaluated the impact of scaling registration techniques to Giga-Pixel Whole Slide Images (WSI), which are large enough for significant memory limitations, and contain recurrent patterns and deformations that hinder traditional alignment algorithms. Furthermore, as tissue sections often contain multiple, discrete, smaller tissue fragments, it is unnecessary to align an entire image when the bulk of the image is background whitespace and tissue fragments orientations are often agnostic of each other. We present a methodology for circumventing large-scale image registration issues in histopathology and accompanying software. By removing background pixels, parsing the slide into discrete tissue segments, and matching, orienting and registering smaller segment pairs, we recovered registrations with lower Target Registration Error (TRE) when compared to utilizing the unmanipulated WSI. We tested our technique by having a pathologist annotate landmarks from 13 pairs of differently stained liver biopsy slides, performing WSI and segment-based registration techniques, and comparing overall TRE. Preliminary results demonstrate superior performance of registering segment pairs versus registering WSI (difference of median TRE of 44 pixels, p<0.001). Segment matching within WSI is an effective solution for histology image registration but requires further testing and validation to ensure its viability for stain translation and 3D histology analysis.",

    "abstract": "Many proteobacteria, such as Escherichia coli, contain two main types of quinones, benzoquinones represented by ubiquinone (UQ) and naphthoquinones such as menaquinone (MK) and dimethyl-menaquinone (DMK). MK and DMK function predominantly in anaerobic respiratory chains, whereas UQ is the major electron carrier used for reduction of dioxygen. However, this division of labor is probably not so stric. Indeed, a pathway that produces UQ under anaerobic conditions in an UbiU-, UbiV- and UbiT-dependent manner has been recently discovered in E. coli while its physiological relevance is not yet understood because of the presence of MK and DMK in this bacterium. In the present study, we established that UQ9 is the single quinone of P. aeruginosa and that is required for growth under anaerobic respiration (denitrification). We demonstrated that ORFs PA3911, PA3912 and PA3913, which are homologues to the E. coli ubiT, ubiV and ubiU genes, respectively, were essential for UQ9 biosynthesis and thus for denitrification in P. aeruginosa. These three genes were hereafter called ubiTPa, ubiVPa and ubiUPa. We showed that UbiVPa accommodates a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Moreover, we demonstrated that UbiUPa and UbiTPa were able to bind UQ and that the isoprenoid tail of UQ was the structural determinant for the recognition by these Ubi proteins. Since the denitrification metabolism of P. aeruginosa is believed to be important for pathogenicity in cystic fibrosis patients, our results highlight the O2-independent UQ biosynthesis pathway as a new possible target to develop innovative antibiotics.",

Here we use three live-cell imaging approaches to assess dimerization of ORs at different expression levels. At high membrane densities, a split GFP assay reveals that {kappa}OR dimerizes, while OR and {delta}OR stay monomeric. In contrast, single-molecule imaging showed no {kappa}OR dimers at low receptor densities. To reconcile our seemingly contradictory results, we used a high-density single-molecule assay to assess membrane protein interactions at densities up to 100x higher than conventional single-molecule imaging. We observe that {kappa}OR is monomeric at low densities and forms dimers at densities that are considered physiological. In contrast, OR and {delta}OR stay monomeric even at the highest densities covered by our approach. The observation of long-lasting {kappa}OR dimers but not higher-order aggregates suggests that ORs dimerize through a single, specific interface.",

    "abstract": "Prokaryotes generally reproduce clonally but can also acquire new genetic material via lateral gene transfer (LGT). Like sex, LGT can prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations predicted by Mullers ratchet for asexual populations. This similarity between sex and LGT raises the question why did eukaryotes abandon LGT in favor of sexual reproduction? Understanding the limitations of LGT provides insight into this evolutionary transition. We model the evolution of a haploid population undergoing LGT at a rate{lambda} and subjected to a mutation rate . We take into account recombination length, L, and genome size, g, neglected by previous theoretical models. We confirm that LGT counters Mullers ratchet by reducing the rate of fixation of deleterious mutations in small genomes. We then demonstrate that this beneficial effect declines rapidly with genome size. Populations with larger genomes are subjected to a faster rate of fixation of deleterious mutations and become more vulnerable to stochastic frequency fluctuations. Mullers ratchet therefore generates a strong constraint on genome size. Importantly, we show that the degeneration of larger genomes can be resisted by increases in the recombination length, the average number of contiguous genes drawn from the environment for LGT. Large increases in genome size, as in early eukaryotes, are only possible as L reaches the same order of magnitude as g. This requirement for recombination across the whole genome can explain the strong selective pressure towards the evolution of sexual cell fusion and reciprocal recombination during early eukaryotic evolution - the origin of meiotic sex.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence that the hippocampus is involved in language production and verbal communication, although little is known about its possible role. According to one view, hippocampus contributes semantic memory to spoken language. Alternatively, hippocampus is involved in the processing the (mis)match between expected sensory consequences of speaking and the perceived speech feedback. In the current study, we re-analysed functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) data of two overt picture-naming studies to test whether hippocampus is involved in speech production and, if so, whether the results can distinguish between a \"pure memory\" versus an \"expectation\" account of hippocampal involvement. In both studies, participants overtly named pictures during scanning while hearing their own speech feedback unimpededly or impaired by a superimposed noise mask. Results showed decreased hippocampal activity when speech feedback was impaired, compared to when feedback was unimpeded. Further, we found increased functional coupling between auditory cortex and hippocampus during unimpeded speech feedback, compared to impaired feedback. Finally, we found significant functional coupling between a hippocampal/supplementary motor area (SMA) interaction term and auditory cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and cerebellum during overt picture naming, but not during listening to ones own pre-recorded voice. These findings indicate that hippocampus plays a role in speech production that is in accordance with an \"expectation\" view of hippocampal functioning.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the behaviors of complex biological systems, underpinning processes such as cellular differentiation, requires taking into account many molecular and genetic elements for which limited information is available past a global knowledge of their pairwise interactions. Logical modeling, notably with Boolean Networks (BNs), is a well-established approach which enables reasoning on the qualitative dynamics of networks accounting for many species. Several dynamical approaches have been proposed to interpret the logic of the regulations encoded by the BNs. The synchronous and (fully) asynchronous ones are the most prominent, where the value of either all or only one component can change at each step. Here we prove that, besides being costly to analyze, these usual interpretations are not adequate to represent quantitative systems, being able to both predict spurious behaviors and miss others. We introduce a new paradigm, the Most Permissive Boolean Networks (MPBNs), which offer the formal guarantee not to miss any behavior achievable by a quantitative model following the same logic. Moreover, MPBNs significantly reduce the complexity of dynamical analysis, enabling to model genome-scale networks.",

    "abstract": "Romanian grasslands have high nature value, being among the most important biodiversity hotspots at the European level. The European Union Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) contradicts the Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 objective by hindering coordinated grassland governance and collaboration among the involved actors. At the European level, few attempts have been made in creating conceptual strategies for implementing conservation measures in a multi-actor and multi-scale governance setting. Our paper focuses on a comparative network analysis of grassland landscape governance of three Romanian regions (Iron Gates Natural Park - SW; Sighisoara - Tarnava Mare - center; and Dobrogea - SE), representatives for grassland management in mountain and lowland settings. We investigated the structural characteristics of one-mode directed grassland governance networks in the three protected areas (standard cohesion and reciprocity metrics and exponential random graph models), the position of institutions participating in networks (node-level centrality metrics), and the perception of CAP influence on grassland governance by farmers benefiting of CAP agri-environmental payments. In Sighisoara, grasslands governance has been centralized but biodiversity-friendly, while in Iron Gates, grasslands were traditionally managed through a decentralized, community-level system, and this type of governance continues to date. Whereas for Dobrogeas grasslands, the governance was performed in an intensive, centralized state-run management regime during the communist time and by large landowners after the transition period ended. Our findings illustrate the structure of the three governance networks and dissimilar patterns of collaboration, indicating distinct particularities to be considered when exploring barriers to and options for successful governance in traditionally managed grasslands in the context of CAP measures-driven management.",

A peculiar and puzzling feature of the NKG2D-based immunorecognition system is the high number of ligands for this single immunoreceptor. In humans, there are a total of eight NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL) comprising two members of the MIC (MICA, MICB) and six members of the ULBP family of glycoproteins (ULBP1 to ULBP6). While MICA has been extensively studied with regard to its biochemistry, cellular expression and function, very little is known about the NKG2DL ULBP4. This is, at least in part, due to its rather restricted expression by very few cell lines and tissues. Recently, constitutive ULBP4 expression by human monocytes was reported, questioning the view of tissue-restricted ULBP4 expression. Here, we scrutinized ULBP4 expression by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytes by analyzing ULBP4 transcripts and ULBP4 surface expression. In contrast to MICA, there was no ULBP4 expression detectable, neither by freshly isolated monocytes nor by PAMP-activated monocytes. However, a commercial antibody erroneously indicated surface ULBP4 on monocytes due to a non-ULBP4-specific binding activity, emphasizing the critical importance of validated reagents for life sciences. Collectively, our data show that ULBP4 is not expressed by monocytes, and likely also not by other peripheral blood immune cells, and therefore exhibits an expression pattern rather distinct from other human NKG2DL.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundStalk lodging (breaking of agricultural plant stalks prior to harvest) is a multi-billion dollar a year problem. Stalk lodging occurs when bending moments induced by a combination of external loading (e.g. wind) and self-loading (e.g. the plants own weight) exceed the bending strength of plant stems. Previous biomechanical plant stem models have investigated both external loading and self-loading of plants, but have evaluated them as separate and independent phenomena. However, these two types of loading are highly interconnected and mutually dependent. The purpose of this paper is twofold: (1) to investigate the combined effect of external loads and plant weight on the displacement and stress state of plant stems / stalks, and (2) to provide a generalized framework for accounting for self-weight during mechanical phenotyping experiments used to predict stalk lodging resistance.\n\nResultsA method of properly accounting for the interconnected relationship between self-loading and external loading of plants stems is presented. The interconnected set of equations are used to produce user-friendly applications by presenting (1) simplified self-loading correction factors for a number of common external loading configurations of plants, and (2) a generalized Microsoft Excel framework that calculates the influence of self-loading on crop stems. The effect of self-loading on the structural integrity of wheat is examined in detail. A survey of several other plants is conducted and the influence of self-loading on their structural integrity is also presented.\n\nConclusionsThe self-loading of plants plays a potentially critical role on the structural integrity of plant stems. Equations and tools provided herein enable researchers to account for the plants weight when investigating the flexural rigidity and bending strength of plant stems.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypically-switched, antibiotic-refractory persisters may prevent pathogen eradication. Although how triggered persistence via starvation-induced (p)ppGpp is well characterized, generation of persisters without starvation are poorly understood. Here we visualized the formation of spontaneous persisters in a small fraction of cells from growing wild type bacteria, revealing a striking single cell rapid switch from growth to dormancy. This switch-like entrance is triggered by GTP dropping beneath a threshold due to stochastic production and self-amplification of (p)ppGpp via allosteric enzyme activation. In addition, persisters are induced by lethal and sublethal concentrations of cell wall antibiotics by inducing (p)ppGpp via cell wall stress response. Thus spontaneous, triggered and antibiotic-induced persisters can all stem from a common metabolic switch: GTP depletion by (p)ppGpp induction, and each pathway of persister formation is activated by different (p)ppGpp synthetases. These persistence pathways are likely conserved in pathogens which may be exploited to potentiate antibiotic efficacy.",

Here, we show that the PDK family is dispensable for the survival of murine embryonic development and that BCKDK serves as a compensatory mechanism by inactivating PDC.\n\nFirst, we knocked out all four Pdk genes one by one. Surprisingly, Pdk total KO embryos developed and were born in expected ratios, but died by postnatal day 4 due to hypoglycemia or ketoacidosis.\n\nFinding that PDC was phosphorylated in these embryos suggested that another kinase compensates for the PDK family. Bioinformatic analysis implicated brunch chain ketoacid dehydrogenase kinase (Bckdk), a key regulator of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) catabolism. Indeed, knockout of Bckdk and the Pdk family led to loss of PDC phosphorylation, increment in PDC activity, elevation of Pyruvate flux into the TCA and early embryonic lethality. These findings reveal a new regulatory crosstalk hardwiring BCAA and glucose catabolic pathways, which feed the TCA cycle.",

    "abstract": "The ability to group sensory stimuli into categories is crucial for efficient interaction with a rich and ever-changing environment. In olfaction, basic features of categorical representation of odours were observed as early as in the olfactory bulb (OB). Categorical representation was described in mitral cells (MCs) as sudden transitions in responses to odours that were morphed along a continuum. However, it remains unclear to what extent such response dynamics actually reflects perceptual categories and decisions therein. Here, we tested the role of learning on category formation in the mouse OB, using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging and behaviour. We imaged MCs responses in naive mice and in awake behaving mice as they learned two tasks with different classification logic. In one task, a 1-decision boundary task, animals learned to classify odour mixtures based on the dominant compound in the mixtures. As expected, categorical representation of close by odours, which was evident already in naive animals, further increased following learning. In a second task, a multi-decision boundary task, animals learned to classify odours independent of their chemical similarity. Rather, odour discrimination was based on the meaning ascribed to them (either rewarding or not). Following the second task, odour representations by MCs reorganized according to the odour value in the new category. This functional reorganization was also reflected as a shift from predominantly excitatory odour responses to predominantly inhibitory odour responses. Our data shows that odour representations by MCs is flexible, shaped by task demands, and carry category-related information.",

From 600 soil samples, we obtained 2,101 Operational Taxonomy Units representing ~18 million Illumina reads (region V4, 18S rRNA gene). All major taxonomic and functional groups were present, dominated by small bacterivorous flagellates (Glissomonadida). Endomyxan plant parasites were absent from forest.

However, we still know very little of the genetic mechanisms underlying changes in these mate preference behaviours. Heliconius butterflies display bright warning patterns, which they also use to recognize conspecifics. Here, we couple QTL for divergence in visual preference behaviours with population genomic and gene expression analyses of neural tissue (central brain, optic lobes and ommatidia) across development in two sympatric Heliconius species. Within a region containing 200 genes, we identify five genes that are strongly associated with divergent visual preferences. Three of these have previously been implicated in key components of neural signalling (specifically an ionotropic glutamate receptor and two regucalcins), and overall our candidates suggest shifts in behaviour involve changes in visual integration or processing. This would allow preference evolution without altering perception of the wider environment.",

    "abstract": "Many viral infections can be prevented by immunizing with live, attenuated vaccines. Early methods of attenuation were hit-and-miss, and these are now much improved by genetic engineering. But even current attenuation methods operate on the principle of genetic harm, reducing the viruss ability to grow, which in turn limits the host immune response below that of infection by wild-type. We use mathematical models of the dynamics of virus and its control by innate and adaptive immunity to explore the tradeoff between attenuation of virus growth and the generation of immunity. Our analysis suggests that directed attenuation that disables key viral defenses against the host immune responses may attenuate viral growth without compromising, and potentially even enhancing the generation of immunity. We explore which immune evasion pathways should be attenuated and how attenuating multiple pathways could lead to robust attenuation of pathology with enhancement of immunity.\n\nAuthor summaryLive attenuated virus vaccines are among the most effective interventions to combat viral infections. Historically, the mechanism of attenuation has been one of genetically reduced viral growth rate, often achieved by adapting the virus to grow in a novel cells. More recent attenuation methods use genetic engineering but also are thought to impair viral growth rate. These classical attenuations typically result in a tradeoff whereby attenuation depresses the within-host viral load and pathology (which is beneficial to vaccine design), but reduces immunity (which is not beneficial). We use models to explore ways of directing the attenuation of a virus to avoid this tradeoff. We show that directed attenuation by interfering with (some) viral immune-evasion pathways can yield a mild infection but elicit higher levels of immunity than of the wild-type virus.",

    "abstract": "Metal implants are used worldwide, with millions of metal nails, plates and fixtures grafted during orthopaedic surgeries. Iron is the most common element of these metal implants. As time passes metal elements can be corroded and iron can be released from the implants in the form of ferric (Fe3+) or ferrous (Fe2+). These iron ions can permeate the surrounding tissues and enter circulation; importantly both Fe3+ and Fe2+ freely pass blood brain barrier (BBB). Can iron from implants represent a risk factor for neurological diseases? This remains an unanswered question. In this study, we discovered that the probability of metal implants delivered through orthopaedic surgeries was higher in patients of Parkinsons diseases (PD) or ischemic stroke than in healthy subjects. This finding instigated subsequent study of iron effects on neuronal cells. In experiments in vivo, we found that iron selectively decreased presence of divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) in neurones through increasing the expression of Ndfip1, which degrades DMT1 and rarely exists in glial cells. At the same time iron accumulation increased expression of DMT1 in astrocytes and microglial cells and triggered reactive astrogliosis and microglial activation. Facing the attack of excess iron, glial cells act as neuroprotectors to uptake more extracellular iron by up-regulating DMT1, whereas neurones limit iron uptake through decreasing DMT1 operation. Cerebral accumulation of iron was associated with impaired cognition, locomotion and mood. Excess iron thus affects neural cells and could increase the risk of neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "New neurons undergo a critical period soon after migration during which the behavior of the animal may result in the survival or culling of these cells. In the songbird song system, new neurons may be maintained in the song motor pathway with respect to motor progression toward a target song--during juvenile song learning, seasonal song restructuring, and experimentally manipulated song variability. However, it is not known whether the quality of song per se, without progressive improvement, may also influence new neuron survival. To test this idea, we experimentally altered song acoustic structure by unilateral denervation of the syrinx. We found no effect of aberrant song on numbers of new neurons in the HVC of the song motor pathway, a loss of left-side dominance in new neurons in the auditory region caudomedial nidopallium (NCM), and a bilateral decrease in new neurons in the basal ganglia nucleus Area X. We propose new neuron survival may be determined in response to behavioral feedback in accordance with the function of new neurons within a given brain region. Studying the effects of singing behaviors on new neurons across multiple brain regions that subserve singing may give rise to general rules underlying the regulation of new neuron survival across taxa and brain regions more broadly.",

The results indicated that iso-PhABA had significantly to moderately higher affinities for some ABA receptors, including PYR1, PYL2, PYL1, PYL3 and PYL10, which resulted in higher inhibition of the PP2C HAB1 in the presence of iso-PhABA than in the presence of ABA. iso-PhABA treatment increased the content of soluble sugars and grape yield without any apparent accompanying adverse effects on the quality of the grapes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMalaria still remains a major killer of children under-five, claiming the life of one child every two minutes globally. More than 78% of deaths among children under-five in Africa are as a result of malaria infection. Despite the several interventions to reduce malaria and anaemia, the disease remains a global public concern as more children continue to die. This study assessed the prevalence and trend of malaria and anaemia in children under-five years from 2012 to 2016.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study among children under-five with malaria and anaemia who received care at the hospital in Jasikan town, Ghana from 2012 to 2016. Data were extracted from the childrens ward admission and discharge registers. We computed descriptive statistics to describe the data. STATA version 14 was used to carry out the analyses.\n\nResultsOut of 30082 malaria cases, 835 were with anaemia from 2012 to 2016. This study demonstrated an overall proportion of malaria with anaemia as 0.028 (28 per 1000 malaria cases). Year 2014 recorded the highest proportion (38 per 1,000 malaria cases) of malaria with anaemia cases in the district. Overall, prevalence rate of malaria and anaemia cases separately was found as 61.5% and 4.4% respectively from 2012-2016. Children within 24-35 months age group contributed the highest (28.3%) and 0-11 months accounted for the lowest (12.9%) malaria with anaemia cases. Majority of malaria with anaemia cases 531 (63.6%) occurred in the rainy season from June to July.\n\nConclusionThere is a high prevalence of malaria with anaemia cases among children under-five from 2012-2016. Age and seasonal variation were found to be predictors of an increase in the prevalence of malaria with anaemia.",

    "abstract": "By invention of soft wearable assistive devices, known as exosuits, a new aspect in assisting unimpaired subjects is introduced. In this study, we designed and developed an exosuit with compliant biarticular thigh actuators, called BAExo. Unlike common method of using rigid actuators in exosuits, the BAExo is made of serial elastic actuators (SEA) resembling artificial muscles (AM). This bioinsipred design is complemented by the novel control concept of using the ground reaction force to adjust these AMs stiffness in the stance phase. By locking the motors in the swing phase the SEAs will be simplified to passive biarticular springs, which is sufficient for leg swinging. The key concept in our design and control approach is synthesizing human locomotion to develop assistive device, instead of copying the outputs of human motor control. Analysing human walking assistance using an experiment-based OpenSim model demonstrates the advantages of the proposed design and control of BAExo, regarding metabolic cost reduction and efficiency of the system. In addition, pilot experiments with the recently developed BAExo hardware support the applicability of the introduced method.\n\nAuthor summaryAging and mobility of elderly people are of crucial concern in developed countries. The U.S. Census Bureau reports that by the middle of the 21st century, about 80 million Americans will be 65 or older. According to the groups research, medical costs resulting from falls by the elderly are expected to approach $32.4 billion by 2020. Therefore, assistance of elderly people and making the assistive devices more intelligent is a need in near future. However, this is not the only application of assistive devices. Exosuits, as soft wearable robots, introduced a new aspect in assisting a large range of population, even healthy young people. We introduce a novel design and control method for a new exosuit. As the research in the field of wearable assistive devices is growing in recent years and its application in daily life becomes more evident for the society, such studies with a unique view in design and control could have a significant impact. Our proposed biologically inspired approach could be potentially applied to other exosuits.",

    "abstract": "Phosphoinositides (PIPs) and their regulatory enzymes are key players in many cellular processes and are required for aspects of vertebrate development. Dysregulated PIP metabolism has been implicated in several human diseases, including a subset of skeletal myopathies that feature structural defects in the triad. The role of PIPs in skeletal muscle formation, and particularly triad biogenesis, has yet to be determined. CDP-diacylglycerol-inositol 3-phosphatidyltransferase (CDIPT) catalyzes the formation of phosphatidylinositol, which is the base of all PIP species. Loss of CDIPT should, in theory, result in the failure to produce PIPs, and thus provide a strategy for establishing the requirement for PIPs during embryogenesis. In this study, we generated cdipt mutant zebrafish and determined the impact on skeletal myogenesis. Analysis of cdipt mutant muscle revealed no apparent global effect on early muscle development. However, small but significant defects were observed in triad size, with T-tubule area, inter terminal cisternae distance and gap width being smaller in cdipt mutants. This was associated with a decrease in motor performance. Overall, these data suggest that myogenesis in zebrafish does not require de novo PIP synthesis but does implicate a role for CDIPT in triad formation.",

    "abstract": "The ectomycorrhizal fungal symbiont Cenococcum geophilum is of great interest as it is globally distributed, associates with many plant species, and has resistance to multiple environmental stressors. C. geophilum is only known from asexual states but is often considered a cryptic species complex, since extreme phylogenetic divergence is often observed within morphologically identical strains. Alternatively, C. geophilum may represent a highly diverse single species, which would suggest cryptic but frequent recombination. Here we describe a new isolate collection of 229 C. geophilum isolates from soils under Populus trichocarpa at 123 collection sites spanning a ~283 mile north-south transect in Washington and Oregon, USA (PNW). To further understanding of the phylogenetic relationships within C. geophilum, we performed maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses to assess divergence within the PNW isolate collection, as well as a global GAPDH phylogenetic analysis of 789 isolates with publicly available data from the United States, Europe, Japan, and other countries. Phylogenetic analyses of the PNW isolates revealed three distinct phylogenetic groups, with 15 clades that strongly resolved at >80% bootstrap support based on a GAPDH phylogeny and one clade segregating strongly in two principle component analyses. The abundance and representation of PNW isolate clades varied greatly across the North-South range, including a monophyletic group of isolates that spanned nearly the entire gradient at ~250 miles. A direct comparison between the GAPDH and ITS phylogenies combined with additional analyses revealed stark incongruence between the ITS and GAPDH gene regions, implicating probable intra-species recombination between PNW isolates. In the global isolate collection phylogeny, 34 clades were strongly resolved at >80% bootstrap support, with some clades having intra- and intercontinental distributions. These data are highly suggestive of divergence within multiple cryptic species, however additional analyses such as higher resolution genotype-by-sequencing approaches are needed to distinguish potential species boundaries and recombination patterns.",

    "abstract": "Zoonotic coronavirus (CoV) infections, like those responsible for the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, cause grave international public health concern. In infected cells, the CoV RNA-synthesizing machinery associates with modified endoplasmic reticulum membranes that are transformed into the viral replication organelle (RO). While double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) appear to be a pan-coronavirus RO element, studies to date describe an assortment of additional coronavirus-induced membrane structures. Despite much speculation, it remains unclear which RO element(s) accommodate viral RNA synthesis. Here we provide detailed 2D and 3D analyses of CoV ROs and show that diverse CoVs essentially induce the same membrane modifications, including the small open double-membrane spherules (DMSs) previously thought to be restricted to gamma- and delta-CoV infections and proposed as sites of replication. Metabolic labelling of newly-synthesized viral RNA followed by quantitative EM autoradiography revealed abundant viral RNA synthesis associated with DMVs in cells infected with the beta-CoVs MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, and the gamma-CoV infectious bronchitis virus. RNA synthesis could not be linked to DMSs or any other cellular or virus-induced structure. Our results provide a unifying model of the CoV RO and clearly establish DMVs as the central hub for viral RNA synthesis and a potential drug target in coronavirus infection.",
