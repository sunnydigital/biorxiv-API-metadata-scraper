    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiologic agent of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19), is rapidly accumulating new mutations. Analysis of these mutations is necessary for gaining knowledge regarding different aspects of therapeutic development. Recently, we have reported a Sanger method based genome sequence of a viral isolate named SARS-CoV-2 NIB-1, circulating in Bangladesh. The genome has four novel mutations in V121D, V843F, A889V and G1691C positions. V121D substitution has the potential to destabilize the Non-Structural Protein (NSP-1) which inactivates the type-1 Interferon-induced antiviral system hence this mutant could be the basis of attenuated vaccines against SARS-CoV-V843F, A889V and G1691C are all located in NSP3. G1691C can decrease the flexibility of the protein while V843F and A889V changed the binding pattern of SARS-CoV-2 Papain-Like protease (PLPro) inhibitor GRL0617. V843F PLPro showed reduced affinity for Interferon Stimulating Gene-15 (ISG-15) protein whereas V843F+A889V double mutants exhibited the same binding affinity as wild type PLPro. Here, V843F is a conserved position of PLPro that damaged the structure but A889V, a less conserved residue, most probably neutralized that damage. Mutants of NSP1 could provide attenuated vaccines against coronavirus. Also, these mutations of PLPro could be targeted to develop anti-SARS therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal microbiota play a fundamental role in human health and disease. Microbial dysbiosis is a hallmark of colorectal cancer (CRC) as tumor stage-specific shifts potentiate tumor growth, influence the inflammatory microenvironment, and alter response to therapy. Recent work has demonstrated a critical role for microbial metabolite exchange in host response. However, the role of most microbial metabolites in colon cancer growth is unclear. To better understand how metabolic exchange between the microbiota and tumor epithelium alter CRC growth, a screen of the most abundant bacterially derived metabolites was assessed. Several metabolites were found to alter CRC growth, but reuterin most significantly suppressed CRC cell proliferation. Reuterin is a bifunctional metabolite containing both hydroxy and aldehyde functional groups. Reuterin is primarily synthesized from glycerol by Lactobacillus reuteri, a commensal bacterium found throughout the gastrointestinal tract. We found that reuterin suppresses growth via alterations to the redox balance of CRC cells. Mechanistically, reuterin potentiates reactive oxygen species (ROS) which leads to irreversible cysteine oxidation and enhanced cell death. Supplementation of either antioxidants or hydrogen sulfide fully rescued growth, suggesting that reuterin is suppressing CRC growth through protein oxidation. These studies demonstrate the potential of reuterin to act as a potent chemotherapeutic for treating colorectal cancers.",

    "abstract": "A striking feature of severe COVID-19 is thrombosis in large as well as small vessels of multiple organs. This has led to the assumption that SARS-CoV-2 virus directly infects and damages the vascular endothelium. However, endothelial expression of ACE2, the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, has not been convincingly demonstrated. Interrogating human bulk and single-cell transcriptomic data, we found ACE2 expression in endothelial cells to be extremely low or absent in vivo and not upregulated by exposure to inflammatory agents in vitro. Also, the endothelial chromatin landscape at the ACE2 locus showed presence of repressive and absence of activation marks, suggesting that the gene is inactive in endothelial cells. Finally, we failed to achieve infection and replication of SARS-CoV-2 in cultured human endothelial cells, which were permissive to productive infection by coronavirus 229E that uses CD13 as the receptor. Our data suggest that SARS-Cov-2 is unlikely to infect endothelial cells directly; these findings are consistent with a scenario where endothelial injury is indirectly caused by the infection of neighbouring epithelial cells and/or due to systemic effects mediated by immune cells, platelets, complement activation, and/or proinflammatory cytokines.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) is the leading cause of death and disability in newborns with the only current treatment option being hypothermia. An increased understanding of the pathways that facilitate tissue repair after HI can aid the development of better treatments. Here we have studied the role of lactate receptor HCAR1 (Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1) in tissue repair after HI in mice. We show that HCAR1 knockout (KO) mice have reduced tissue regeneration compared with wildtype (WT) mice. Further, proliferation of neural progenitor cells and microglial activation were impaired after HI. Transcriptome analysis showed a strong transcriptional response to HI in the subventricular zone of WT mice involving about 7300 genes. In contrast, the HCAR1 KO mice showed a very modest response to HI, involving about 750 genes. Notably, fundamental processes involved in tissue repair such as cell cycle and innate immunity were dysregulated in HCAR1 KO. Taken together, our data suggest that HCAR1 is a key transcriptional regulator of the pathways that promote tissue regeneration after HI. Thus, HCAR1 could be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of neonatal HI and other forms of brain ischemia.",

With only 95 body wall muscles and 302 neurons, Caenorhabditis elegans is an attractive model organism to use in uncovering the connection between neural circuitry and movement. This study provides a comprehensive examination of the muscle cell activity used by C. elegans during both forward and reverse locomotion. By tracking freely moving worms that express genetically encoded calcium indicators in their muscle cells, we directly measure the patterns of activity that occur during movement. We then analyzed these patterns using a variety of signal processing and statistical techniques. Although our results agree with many previous findings, we also discovered there is significantly different mean Ca++ levels in many of the muscle cells during forward and reverse locomotion and, when considered independently, the dorsal and ventral muscle activation waves exhibit classical neuromechanical phase lag (NPL).",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the pathogen accountable for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Viral entry via binding of the receptor binding domain (RBD) located within the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein to its target receptor angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 2 is a key step in cell infection. The efficient transition of the virus is linked to a unique protein called open reading frame (ORF) 8. As SARS-CoV-2 infections can develop into life-threatening lower respiratory syndromes, effective therapy options are urgently needed. Several publications propose vitamin D treatment, although its mode of action against COVID-19 is not fully elucidated. It is speculated that vitamin Ds beneficial effects are mediated by up-regulating LL-37, a well-known antimicrobial peptide with antiviral effects.\n\nMethodsRecombinantly expressed SARS-CoV-2 S protein, the extended S1 subunit (S1e), the S2 subunit (S2), the receptor binding domain (RBD), and ORF8 were used for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies to investigate LL-37s ability to bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins and to localize its binding site within the S protein. Binding competition studies were conducted to confirm an inhibitory action of LL-37 on the attachment of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to its entry receptor ACE2.\n\nResultsWe could show that LL-37 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein (LL-37/SStrep KD = 410 nM, LL-37/SHis KD = 410 nM) with the same affinity, as SARS-CoV-2 binds to hACE2 (hACE2/SStrep KD = 370 nM, hACE2/SHis KD = 370 nM). The binding is not restricted to the RBD of the S protein, but rather distributed along the entire length of the protein. Interaction between LL-37 and ORF8 was detected with a KD of 290 nM. Further, inhibition of the binding of SStrep (IC50 = 740 nM), S1e (IC50 = 170 nM), and RBD (IC50 = 130 nM) to hACE2 by LL-37 was demonstrated.\n\nConclusionsWe have revealed a biochemical link between vitamin D, LL-37, and COVID-19 severity. SPR analysis demonstrated that LL-37 binds to SARS-CoV-2 S protein and inhibits binding to its receptor hACE2, and most likely viral entry into the cell. This study supports the prophylactic use of vitamin D to induce LL-37 that protects from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the therapeutic administration of vitamin D for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Further, our results provide evidence that the direct use of LL-37 by inhalation and systemic application may reduce the severity of COVID-19.",

Analysis of the TCGA ovarian cancer database revealed CXCR6 to be associated with CD103 and increased patient survival. Functional studies in mouse models of ovarian cancer revealed that CXCR6 is a marker of resident, but not circulatory tumor-specific memory CD8 T cells. Knockout of CXCR6 in tumor-specific CD8 T cells showed reduced retention in tumor tissues leading to diminished resident memory responses and poor control of ovarian cancer\n\nConclusionsCXCR6 by promoting increased retention in tumor tissues serves a critical role in resident memory T cell-mediated immunosurveillance and control of ovarian cancer.

    "abstract": "The human skin microbiome is a key player in human health, with diverse functions ranging from defense against pathogens to education of the immune system. While recent studies have begun to shed light on the valuable role that skin microorganisms have in maintaining a healthy skin barrier, a detailed understanding of the complex interactions that shape healthy skin microbial communities is limited. Cobamides, the vitamin B12 class of cofactor, are essential for organisms across the tree of life. Because this vitamin is only produced by a limited fraction of prokaryotes, cobamide sharing has been shown to mediate community dynamics within microbial communities. Here, we provide the first large-scale unbiased metagenomic assessment of cobamide biosynthesis and utilization in the skin microbiome. We show that while numerous and diverse taxa across the major bacterial phyla on the skin are cobamide dependent, relatively few species encode for de novo cobamide biosynthesis. We find that cobamide sharing shapes the network structure in microbial communities across the different microenvironments of the skin and that changes in community structure and microbiome diversity are driven by the abundance of cobamide producers in the Corynebacterium genus, in both healthy and disease skin states. Lastly, we find that de novo cobamide biosynthesis is enriched only in host-associated Corynebacterium species, including those prevalent on human skin. We confirm that the cofactor is produced in excess through quantification of cobamide production by skin-associated species isolated in the laboratory. Taken together, our results support a role for cobamide sharing within skin microbial communities, which we predict stabilizes the microbiome and mediates host interactions.",

    "abstract": "Antivirals targeting SARS-CoV-2 could improve treatment of COVID-19. We evaluated the efficacy of clinically relevant hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protease inhibitors (PI) against SARS-CoV-2 and their interactions with remdesivir, the only antiviral approved for treatment of COVID-19. HCV PI showed differential potency in VeroE6 cell-based antiviral assays based on detection of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. Linear PI boceprevir, telaprevir and narlaprevir had 50% effective concentrations (EC50) of ~40 M. Among macrocyclic PI simeprevir, paritaprevir, grazoprevir, glecaprevir, voxilaprevir, vaniprevir, danoprevir and deldeprevir, simeprevir had the highest (EC50 15 M) and glecaprevir the lowest (EC50 >178 M) potency. Acyclic PI asunaprevir and faldaprevir had EC50 of 72 and 23 M, respectively. ACH-806, an HCV NS3 protease co-factor NS4A inhibitor, had EC50 of 46 M. For selected PI, potency was similar in human hepatoma Huh7.5 cells. Selectivity indexes, based on antiviral and cell viability assays, were highest for linear PI. In combination with remdesivir, linear PI boceprevir and narlaprevir showed antagonism, while macrocyclic PI simeprevir, paritaprevir and grazoprevir showed synergism with drug reduction indexes of up to 27 for simeprevir. Treatment of infected cultures with equipotent concentrations (1-fold EC50) of HCV PI revealed minor differences in barrier to SARS-CoV-2 escape. Complete viral suppression was achieved treating with [&ge;]3-fold EC50 boceprevir or combination of 1-fold EC50 simeprevir with 0.4-fold EC50 remdesivir, not leading to significant viral suppression in single treatments. Considering potency, human plasma concentrations and synergism with remdesivir, simeprevir seemed the most promising compound for optimization of future antiviral treatments of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes one of the most important infectious diseases in humans, leading to 1.5 million deaths every year. Specialized protein transport systems, called type VII secretion systems (T7SSs), are central for its virulence, but also crucial for nutrient and metabolite transport across the mycobacterial cell envelope. Here we present the first structure of an intact T7SS inner membrane complex of M. tuberculosis. We show how the 2.32 MDa, 165 transmembrane helices-containing ESX-5 assembly is restructured and stabilized as a trimer of dimers by the MycP5 protease. A trimer of MycP5 caps a central periplasmic dome-like chamber formed by three EccB5 dimers, with the proteolytic sites facing towards the cavity. This chamber suggests a central secretion and processing conduit. Complexes without MycP5 show disruption of the EccB5 periplasmic assembly and increased flexibility, highlighting the importance of this component for complex integrity. Beneath the EccB5-MycP5 chamber, dimers of the EccC5 ATPase assemble into three four-transmembrane helix bundles, which together seal the potential central secretion channel. Individual cytoplasmic EccC5 domains adopt two distinctive conformations, likely reflecting different secretion states. Our work suggests a novel mechanism of protein transport and provides a structural scaffold to aid drug development against the major human pathogen.",

Reducing viral load in patient saliva using antiviral mouthwashes may therefore have a role as a control measure in limiting virus spread, particularly in dental settings. Here, the efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 inactivation by seven commercially available mouthwashes with a range of active ingredients were evaluated in vitro. We demonstrate [&ge;]4.1 to [&ge;]5.5 log10 reduction in SARS-CoV-2 titre following a one minute treatment with commercially available mouthwashes containing 0.01-0.02% stabilised hypochlorous acid or 0.58% povidone iodine, and non-specialist mouthwashes with both alcohol-based and alcohol-free formulations designed for home use. In contrast, products containing 1.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate were ineffective against SARS-CoV-2 in these tests. This study contributes to the growing body of evidence surrounding virucidal efficacy of mouthwashes/oral rinses against SARS-CoV-2, and has important applications in reducing risk associated with aerosol generating procedures in dentistry and potentially for infection control more widely.",

    "abstract": "The crAss-like phages are ubiquitous and highly abundant members of the human gut virome that infect commensal bacteria of the order Bacteroidales. Although incapable of classical lysogeny, these viruses demonstrate unexplained long-term persistence in the human gut microbiome, dominating the virome in some individuals. Here we demonstrate that rapid phase variation of alternate capsular polysaccharides plays an important role in dynamic equilibrium between phage sensitivity and resistance in B. intestinalis cultures, allowing phage and bacteria to multiply in parallel. The data also suggests the role of concomitant phage persistence mechanisms associated with delayed lysis of infected cells, such as carrier state infection. From an ecological and evolutionary standpoint this type of phage-host interaction is consistent with the Piggyback-the-Winner model, which suggests a preference towards lysogenic or other \"benign\" forms of phage infection when the host is stably present at high abundance.\n\nTeaserCrAss-like phage persistence in Bacteroides is associated with capsule phase-variation and additional unexplored mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Phage therapy is a century-old technique employing viruses (phages) to treat bacterial infections. In the clinic, phage therapy often is used in combination with antibiotics. Antibiotics, however, interfere with critical bacterial activities, such as DNA and protein synthesis, which also are required for phage infection processes. Resulting antagonistic impacts of antibiotics on phages nevertheless are not commonly determined in association with phage therapy studies using standard, planktonic approaches. Here we assess the antagonistic impact of two antibiotics, colistin and ciprofloxacin, on the bactericidal, bacteriolytic, and new virion production activities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa podovirus PEV2, using a broth culture, optical density-based  lysis profile assay. Though phage-antibiotic combinations were more potent in reducing cell viability than phages or antibiotics alone, colistin substantially interfered with phage PEV2 bacteriolytic and virion-production activities at minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Ciprofloxacin, by contrast, had no such impact at 1x MIC or 3x MIC. At higher but still clinically relevant concentrations (9x MIC) burst sizes were still significant (~30 phages/infected bacterium). We corroborated these lysis profile results by more traditional measurements (colony forming units, plaque forming units, one-step growth experiments) and two other P. aeruginosa phages. To our knowledge this is the first study in which detailed antibiotic impact on P. aeruginosa phage infection activities has been determined under conditions similar to those used to determine antibiotic MICs and could point especially to ciprofloxacin as a minimally antagonistic phage therapy co-treatment of P. aeruginosa infections.",

    "abstract": "Although viruses have threatened our ancestors for millions of years, prehistoric epidemics of viruses are largely unknown. Endogenous bornavirus-like elements (EBLs) are ancient viral sequences that have been integrated into animal genomes. These elements can be used as molecular fossil records to trace past bornaviral infections. In this study, we systematically identified EBLs in vertebrate genomes and revealed the history of bornavirus infections over nearly 100 million years. We found that ancient bornaviral infections have occurred in diverse vertebrate lineages, especially in primate ancestors. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that primate ancestors had been infected with various bornaviral lineages during evolution. Moreover, EBLs in primate genomes formed clades according to their integration ages, suggesting that epidemic lineages of bornaviruses had changed chronologically. However, we found that some bornaviral lineages coexisted with primate ancestors and underwent repeated endogenizations for tens of millions of years. Furthermore, this viral lineage that coexisted with primate ancestors was also endogenized in some ancestral bats. Notably, the geographic distributions of these bat ancestors have been reported to overlap with the migration route of primate ancestors, suggesting that long-term virus-host coexistence could have expanded the geographic distributions of the viral lineage and might have spread their infections to new hosts. Thus, our findings describe hidden virus-host co-evolutionary history over geological timescales, including chronological change in epidemic bornaviral lineages, long-term virus-host coexistence, and expansion of viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Cardiolipin (DPCL) biosynthesis has barely been explored in Archaeal isoprenoid-based ether lipid membranes. Here, we identified a cardiolipin synthase (MhCls) from the mesophilic anaerobic methanogen Methanospirillum hungatei. The enzyme was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, purified, and subsequently characterized by LC-MS. MhCls utilizes two archaetidylglycerol molecules in a transesterification reaction to synthesize archaeal di-phosphate cardiolipin (aDPCL) and glycerol. The enzyme is invariant to the stereochemistry of the glycerol-backbone and the nature of the lipid tail, as it also accepts phosphatidylglycerol to generate di-phosphate cardiolipin (DPCL). Remarkably, in the presence of archaetidylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol, MhCls formed an archaeal-bacterial hybrid di-phosphate cardiolipin (hDPCL), that so far has not been observed in nature. Due to the reversibility of the transesterification, cardiolipin can be converted back in presence of glycerol into phosphatidylglycerol. In the presence of other compounds that contain primary hydroxyl groups (e.g. alcohols, water, sugars) various natural and unique artificial phospholipid species could be synthesized, including multiple di-phosphate cardiolipin species. Moreover, MhCls could utilize a glycolipid in the presence of phosphatidylglycerol to form a glycosyl-mono-phosphate cardiolipin, emphasizing the promiscuity of this cardiolipin synthase.",

We benchmark a dRNA targeting kit that circumvents the standard reverse transcription limiting, cDNA-based in situ sequencing (ISS). We found a five-fold increase in transcript detection efficiency when compared to cDNA-based ISS and also validated its multiplexing capability by targeting a curated panel of 50 genes from previous publications on mouse brain sections, leading to additional data interpretation such as de novo cell typing. With this increased efficiency, we maintain specificity, multiplexing capabilities and ease of implementation. Overall, the dRNA chemistry shows significant improvements in target detection efficiency, closing the gap between the gold standard of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) based technologies and opens up possibilities to explore new biological questions previously not possible with cDNA-based ISS, nor with FISH.",

Pangenome analysis was performed using software Spine (v0.2.3), AGEnt (v0.2.3) and ClustAGE (v0.7.6). The average pangenome size was 45,40,849 bp with 4,391 coding sequences (CDS), with a GC content of 65.4%. The size of the core genome was 36,83,161 bp, contained 3,698 CDS and had an average GC content of 65.1%. The average accessory genome size was 6,96,320.9 bp, with 539.4 CDS and GC content of 67.9%. Among the accessory elements complete deletion of CRISPR-associated endoribonuclease cas1 (Rv2817c), cas2 (Rv2816c), CRISPR type III-a/mtube-associated protein csm6 (Rv2818c), CRISPR type III-a/mtube-associated ramp protein csm5 (Rv2819c) and partial deletion (61.5%) CRISPR type III-a/mtube-associated ramp protein csm4 (Rv2820c) sequences was found specifically in modern Beijing lineages taken in assortment. The sequences were validated using conventional PCR method, which precisely amplified the corresponding targets of sequence elements with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Deletion of accessory CRISPR sequence elements amongst the modern Beijing sub-lineage of M. tuberculosis suggest more defective DNA-repair in these strains which may enhance virulence of the strains.

Because primary cilia are known to sensitize or bias the signaling of cell surface receptors, we investigate how ciliary insulin receptors influence glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in {beta} cells by gauging how cytosolic calcium concentration changes in a mouse insulinoma cell line (MIN6). Purified recombinant insulin suppresses calcium elevation in response to glucose in these cells. Interestingly, ciliated cells show attenuated cytosolic calcium elevation compared to cilium-free cells after glucose stimulation even in the absence of exogenous insulin. We observe that ciliary IR is highly phosphorylated, and the phospho-IR density decreases when cells are either treated with an insulin receptor (IR) inhibitor, BMS536924, or ciliary function is disrupted through either IFT88 or BBS1 knockdown. Consistently, the attenuation of calcium elevation in ciliated cells is abrogated when cells are either treated with IR inhibitor or when primary cilia are impaired. We further demonstrate that ciliary IR signaling hyperpolarizes the plasma membrane but has no apparent impact on glucose-induced ATP production. Thus, our results argue that primary cilia sensitize insulin receptor signaling and mediate negative feedback in GSIS in pancreatic {beta} cells.",

Gene duplications of KU70 have the hallmark of long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1) mediated retrotransposition with evidence of target-site duplications, the poly-A tails, and the absence of introns. Evolutionary analysis of this expanded family of KU70-derived \"NUKU\" retrogenes reveals that these genes are both ancient and also actively being created in extant primate species. NUKU retrogenes show evidence of functional divergence away from KU70, as evinced by their altered pattern of tissue expression and possible translation in the human testes. Molecular modeling predicted that mutations in Nuku2p at the interaction interface with Ku80p would prevent the assembly of the Ku heterodimer. The lack of Nuku2p-Ku80p interaction was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assay, which contrasts the robust interaction of Ku70p-Ku80p. While several NUKU retrogenes appear to have been degraded by mutation, NUKU2 shows evidence of positive natural selection, suggesting that this retrogene is undergoing neofunctionalization. Although Nuku proteins do not appear to antagonize retroviruses in cell culture, the observed expansion and rapid evolution of NUKUs could be being driven by alternative selective pressures related to infectious disease or an undefined role in primate physiology.",

    "abstract": "In Escherichia coli, DNA replication is catalyzed by an assembly of proteins, the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. This complex includes the polymerase and proofreading subunits as well as the processivity clamp and clamp loader complex. The holC gene encodes an accessory protein (known as x) to the core clamp loader complex and is the only protein of the holoenzyme that binds to single-strand DNA binding protein, SSB. HolC is not essential for viability although mutants show growth impairment, genetic instability and sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. In this study, to elucidate the role of HolC in replication, we isolate spontaneous suppressor mutants in a holC{Delta} strain and identify these by whole genome sequencing. Some suppressors are alleles of RNA polymerase, suggesting that transcription is problematic for holC mutant strains or sspA, stringent starvation protein. Using a conditional holC plasmid, we examine factors affecting transcription elongation and termination for synergistic or suppressive effects on holC mutant phenotypes. Alleles of RpoA (), RpoB ({beta}) and RpoC ({beta}) RNA polymerase holoenzyme can partially suppress loss of HolC. In contrast, mutations in transcription factors DksA and NusA enhanced the inviability of holC mutants. Mfd had no effect nor did elongation factors GreA and GreB. HolC mutants showed enhanced sensitivity to bicyclomycin, a specific inhibitor of Rho-dependent termination. Bicyclomycin also reverses suppression of holC by rpoA rpoC and sspA.These results are consistent with the hypothesis that transcription complexes block replication in holC mutants and Rho-dependent transcriptional termination and DksA function are particularly important to sustain viability and chromosome integrity.\n\nIMPORTANCETranscription elongation complexes present an impediment to DNA replication. We provide evidence that one component of the replication clamp loader complex, HolC, of E. coli is required to overcome these blocks. This genetic study of transcription factor effects on holC growth defects implicates Rho-dependent transcriptional termination and DksA function as critical. It also implicates, for the first time, a role of SspA, stringent starvation protein, in avoidance or tolerance of replication/replication conflicts. We speculate that HolC helps resolve codirectional collisions between replication and transcription complexes, which become toxic in HolCs absence.",

The protein YpdA has recently been shown to function as an essential NADPH-dependent reductase of oxidized bacillithiol disulfide (BSSB) resulting from stress responses and is crucial in maintaining the reduced pool of BSH and cellular redox balance. In this work, we present the first crystallographic structures of YpdAs, namely from S. aureus and B. cereus. Our analyses reveal a uniquely organized biological tetramer; however, the monomeric subunit has high structural similarity to other flavin disulfide reductases. The absence of a redox active cysteine in the vicinity of the FAD isoalloxazine ring implies a new direct disulfide reduction mechanism, which is backed by the presence of a potentially gated channel, serving as a putative binding site for BSSB in proximity to the FAD cofactor.

    "abstract": "Antifungal composite edible coatings (ECs) formulated with pregelatinized potato starch (PPS, 1.0-2.0 % w/w) as biopolymer, glyceryl monostearate (GMS, 0.5-1.5 %, w/w) as hydrophobe, glycerol (Gly, 0.5-1.5 %, w/w) as plasticizer, and sodium benzoate (SB, 2 % w/w) as antifungal agent were optimized using the Box-Behnken response surface methodology to extend the postharvest life of Orri mandarins. The second order polynomial models satisfactorily fitted the experimental data, with high values of the coefficient of determination for the different variables (R2>0.91). The individual linear effect of GMS concentration was significant in all the responses evaluated, whereas PPS only affected emulsion viscosity, fruit tacking, and weight loss of coated mandarins. Gly only affected acetaldehyde content in the juice of coated mandarins when interacted with PPS and in the quadratic effect. The optimum concentrations of PPS, GMS, and Gly for the starch-based EC based on maximum fruit quality and required emulsion properties were predicted to be 2.0, 0.5 and 1.0 % (w/w), respectively. The optimal EC reduced weight loss of mandarins and created a modified atmosphere within the fruit without negatively affecting the overall acceptability of the fruit. On the other hand, the optimized antifungal EC containing SB significantly reduced postharvest green and blue molds and sour rot on mandarins artificially inoculated with the pathogens Penicillium digitatum, Penicillium italicum and Geotrichum citri-aurantii, respectively. Therefore, the optimized antifungal EC showed potential to control the main postharvest diseases and maintain the overall quality of  Orri mandarins and could be a suitable alternative to commercial citrus waxes formulated with conventional chemical fungicides.",

    "abstract": "The pathogens Vibrio cholerae and Haemophilus influenzae use tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporters (TRAPs) to scavenge sialic acid from host tissues. They use it as a nutrient or to evade the innate immune system by sialylating surface lipopolysaccharides. An essential component of TRAP transporters is a periplasmic substrate binding protein (SBP). Without substrate, the SBP has been proposed to rest in an open-state, which is not recognised by the transporter. Substrate binding induces a conformational change of the SBP and it is thought that this closed state is recognised by the transporter, triggering substrate translocation. Here we use real time single molecule FRET experiments and crystallography to investigate the open- to closed-state transition of VcSiaP, the SBP of the sialic acid TRAP transporter from V. cholerae. We show that the conformational switching of VcSiaP is strictly substrate induced, confirming an important aspect of the proposed transport mechanism. Two new crystal structures of VcSiaP provide insights into the closing mechanism. While the first structure contains the natural ligand, sialic acid, the second structure contains an artificial peptide in the sialic acid binding site. Together, the two structures suggest that the ligand itself stabilises the closed state and that SBP closure is triggered by physically bridging the gap between the two lobes of the SBP. Finally, we demonstrate that the affinity for the artificial peptide substrate can be substantially increased by varying its amino acid sequence and by this, serve as a starting point for the development of peptide-based inhibitors of TRAP transporters.",

    "abstract": "Protein Z (PZ) dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) is a natural anticoagulant inhibiting blood coagulation proteases fXa and fXIa. Despite being a member of the serpin superfamily, it possesses unique structural features such as activation by PZ that regulate its inhibitory function. It is well known that effecient protease inhibition by serpins is dependent on the dynamics of its reactive center loop (RCL). In order to understand the RCL dynamics of ZPI, we performed Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation on ZPI and its E371 and S359 variants located at important conserved functional sites. Unexpectedly, the RCL of E371 variants, such as E371K, E371R, and E371Q, were shown to be very stable due to compensatory interactions at the proximal end of RCL. Interestingly, RCL flexibility was shown to be enhanced in the double mutant K318-E371 due to the repulsive effect of increased negative charge on top of the breach region. Principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with residue wise interaction network (RIN) revealed correlated motion between the RCL and the PZ binding regions in the WT. Whereas the analysis revealed a loss of regulation in correlated motion between RCL and PZ binding hotspot Tyr240 in the double mutant. Additionally, the S359F and S359I mutations also resulted in increased RCL flexibility owing to the disruption of stabilizing hydrogen bonding interaction at the N terminal end of S5A. Thus, the current study proposes that the overall stabilizing interactions of S5A is a major regulator of proper loop movement of ZPI for protease inhibition and therefore its activity. The results would be beneficial to engineer activity compromised ZPI mutants as a prophylactic agent for the treatment of hemophilia.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a newly identified virus that has resulted in over 1.3 M deaths globally and over 59 M cases globally to date. Small molecule inhibitors that reverse disease severity have proven difficult to discover. One of the key approaches that has been widely applied in an effort to speed up the translation of drugs is drug repurposing. A few drugs have shown in vitro activity against Ebola virus and demonstrated activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vivo. Most notably the RNA polymerase targeting remdesivir demonstrated activity in vitro and efficacy in the early stage of the disease in humans. Testing other small molecule drugs that are active against Ebola virus would seem a reasonable strategy to evaluate their potential for SARS-CoV-2. We have previously repurposed pyronaridine, tilorone and quinacrine (from malaria, influenza, and antiprotozoal uses, respectively) as inhibitors of Ebola and Marburg virus in vitro in HeLa cells and of mouse adapted Ebola virus in mouse in vivo. We have now tested these three drugs in various cell lines (VeroE6, Vero76, Caco-2, Calu-3, A549-ACE2, HUH-7 and monocytes) infected with SARS-CoV-2 as well as other viruses (including MHV and HCoV 229E). The compilation of these results indicated considerable variability in antiviral activity observed across cell lines. We found that tilorone and pyronaridine inhibited the virus replication in A549-ACE2 cells with IC50 values of 180 nM and IC50 198 nM, respectively. We have also tested them in a pseudovirus assay and used microscale thermophoresis to test the binding of these molecules to the spike protein. They bind to spike RBD protein with Kd values of 339 nM and 647 nM, respectively. Human Cmax for pyronaridine and quinacrine is greater than the IC50 hence justifying in vivo evaluation. We also provide novel insights into their mechanism which is likely lysosomotropic.",

This time-course study reports the changes of regional brain volumes and diffusion scalar parameters, such as fractional anisotropy across twelve representative brain regions as measures of brain structural stability. The scalar DTI parameters and regional volumes were highly variable over the first two weeks after fixation. The same parameters were stable over a two to eight-week window after fixation which means confounds from tissue stability over that scanning window are minimal. Quantitative connectomes were analyzed over the same time period with extension out to one year. While there is some change in the scalar metrics at one year after fixation, these changes are sufficiently small, particularly in white matter to support reproducible connectomes over a period ranging from two weeks to one year post fixation. These findings delineate a stable scanning period during which brain volumes, diffusion scalar metrics and connectomes are remarkably stable.",

Severe COVID-19-risk variants were significantly associated with the expression of 11 protein-coding genes, and overlapped with either target gene promoter or cis-regulatory regions that interact with target promoters in the cell types where their effects are most prominent. For example, we identified that the association between variants in the 3p21.31 risk locus and the expression of CCR2 in classical monocytes is likely mediated through an active cis-regulatory region that interacted with CCR2 promoter specifically in monocytes. The expression of several other genes showed prominent genotype-dependent effects in non-classical monocytes, NK cells, B cells, or specific T cell subtypes, highlighting the potential of COVID-19 genetic risk variants to impact the function of diverse immune cell types and influence severe disease manifestations.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is an opportunistic pathogen that causes diverse human infections such as chronic airway infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Although many sequenced genomes are available, a comprehensive comparison between genomes of CF versus non-CF PA isolates remains yet to be conducted. In order to gain a deeper understanding into the PA adaptation in the CF airway, we performed a Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) using a total of 1,001 PA genomes. Genetic variations uniquely identified among CF isolates were categorized into (i) alterations in protein-coding regions either large- or small-scale and (ii) polymorphic variations in intergenic regions. We introduced each CF-specific genetic alteration into the genome of PAO1, a prototype PA strain and experimentally validated their outcomes. Loci readily mutated among CF isolates include genes encoding a probable sulphatase and a probable TonB-dependent receptor (PA2332~PA2336), L-cysteine transporter (YecS, PA0313) and a probable transcriptional regulator (PA5438). A promoter region of heme/hemoglobin uptake outer membrane receptor (PhuR, PA4710) was similarly identified as meaningfully different between the CF and non-CF isolate groups. Our analysis, the first of its kind, highlights how PA evolves its genome to persist and survive within the context of chronic CF infection.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural mechanism for protecting against harmful genetic elements and regulating gene expression, which can be artificially triggered by the delivery of homologous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This mechanism can be exploited as a highly specific and environmentally friendly pest control strategy. To this aim, systems for producing large amounts of recombinant dsRNA are necessary. We describe a system to efficiently produce large amounts of circular dsRNA in Escherichia coli and demonstrate the efficient insecticidal activity of these molecules against Western corn rootworm (WCR, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte), a highly damaging pest of corn crops. In our system, the two strands of the dsRNA are expressed in E. coli embedded within the very stable scaffold of Eggplant latent viroid (ELVd), a small circular non-coding RNA. Stability in E. coli of the corresponding plasmids with long inverted repeats was achieved by using a cDNA coding for a group-I autocatalytic intron from Tetrahymena thermophila as a spacer. RNA circularization and large-scale accumulation in E. coli cells was facilitated by co-expression of eggplant tRNA ligase, the enzyme that ligates ELVd during replication in the host plant. The inserted intron efficiently self-spliced from the RNA product during transcription. Circular RNAs containing a dsRNA moiety homologous to smooth septate junction 1 (DvSSJ1) gene exhibited excellent insecticide activity against WCR larvae. Finally, we show that the viroid scaffold can be separated from the final circular dsRNA product using a second T. thermophila self-splicing intron in a permuted form.",

In genetic forms of NDs, this late onset phenomenon remains largely unexplained.\n\nResultsAnalyzing single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from Alzheimers disease (AD) patients, we find increased transcriptional heterogeneity in AD excitatory neurons. We hypothesized that transcriptional heterogeneity precedes ND pathologies. To test this idea experimentally, we used juvenile forms (72Q; 180Q) of Huntingtons disease (HD) iPSCs, differentiated them into committed neuronal progenitors, and obtained single cell expression profiles. We show a global increase in gene expression variability in HD. Autophagy genes become more stable, while energy and actin-related genes become more variable in the mutant cells. Knocking-down several differentially-variable genes resulted in increased aggregate formation, a pathology associated with HD. We further validated the increased transcriptional heterogeneity in CHD8+/- cells, a model for autism spectrum disorder.\n\nConclusionsOverall, our results suggest that although NDs develop over time, transcriptional regulation imbalance is present already at very early developmental stages. Therefore, an intervention aimed at this early phenotype may be of high diagnostic value.",

    "abstract": "S100 proteins are small, typically homodimeric, vertebrate-specific EF-hand proteins that establish Ca2+-dependent protein-protein interactions in the intra- and extracellular environment and are overexpressed in various pathologies. There are about 20 distinct human S100 proteins with numerous potential partner proteins. Here, we used a quantitative holdup assay to measure affinity profiles of most members of the S100 protein family against a library of chemically synthetized foldamers. The profiles allowed us to quantitatively map the binding promiscuity of each member towards the foldamer library. Since the library was designed to systematically contain most binary natural amino acid side chain combinations, the data also provide insight into the promiscuity of each S100 protein towards all potential naturally-occurring S100 partners in the human proteome. Such information will be precious for future drug design of modulators of S100 pathological activities.",

    "abstract": "Structured RNA elements are common in the genomes of RNA viruses, often playing critical roles during viral infection. Some RNA elements use forms of tRNA mimicry, but the diverse ways this mimicry can be achieved are poorly understood. Histidine-accepting tRNA-like structures (TLSHis) are examples found at the 3' termini of some positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) viruses where they interact with several host proteins, induce histidylation of the RNA genome, and facilitate several processes important for infection, to include replication. As only five TLSHis examples had been reported, we explored the possible larger phylogenetic distribution and diversity of this TLS class using bioinformatic approaches. We identified many new examples of TLSHis, yielding a rigorous consensus sequence and secondary structure model that we validated by chemical probing of representative TLSHis RNAs. We confirmed new examples as authentic TLSHis by demonstrating their ability to be histidylated in vitro, then used mutational analyses to verify a tertiary interaction that is likely analogous to the D- and T-loop interaction found in canonical tRNAs. These results expand our understanding of how diverse RNA sequences achieve tRNA-like structures and functions in the context of viral RNA genomes and lay the groundwork for high-resolution structural studies of tRNA mimicry by histidine-accepting TLSs.",

    "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) induction of large frequencies of highly functional memory T-cells has attracted much interest in the utility of CMV-based vaccine vectors, with exciting preclinical data obtained in models of infectious diseases and cancer. However, pathogenesis of human CMV (HCMV) remains a concern. Attenuated CMV-based vectors, such as replication- or spread-deficient viruses potentially offer an alternative to fully replicating vectors. However, it is not well-understood how CMV attenuation impacts vector immunogenicity, in particularly when administered via relevant routes of immunization such as the skin. Herein we used the murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) model to investigate the impact of vector attenuation on T-cell memory formation following subcutaneous administration. We found that the spread deficient virus ({Delta}gL-MCMV) was impaired in its ability to induce memory CD8+ T-cells reactive to some (M38, IE1) but not all (IE3) viral antigens. Impaired memory T-cell development was associated with a preferential and pronounced loss of polyfunctional (IFN-{gamma}+ TNF-+) T-cells, and was not rescued by increasing the dose of replication-defective MCMV. Finally, whilst vector attenuation reduced dendritic cell (DC) recruitment to skindraining lymph nodes, systematic depletion of multiple DC subsets during acute subcutaneous MCMV infection had a negligible impact on T-cell memory formation, implying that attenuated responses induced by replication-deficient vectors were likely not a consequence of impaired initial DC activation. Thus, overall, these data imply that the choice of antigen and/or cloning strategy of exogenous antigen in combination with the route of immunization may influence the ability of attenuated CMV vectors to induce robust functional T-cell memory.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeople in westernised countries spend most of their time indoors. A healthy human microbiome relies on the interaction with and exchange of microbes that takes place between the human body and its environment. For this reason, the built environment might represent a potent source of commensal microbes. Anaerobic microbes are of particular interest, as researchers have not yet sufficiently clarified how the human microbiome acquires oxygen-sensitive microbes, such as obligate or facultative anaerobes.\n\nMethodsWe sampled ten households and used propidium monoazide to assess the viability of the collected prokaryotes. We compared the microbiome profiles based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and confirmed our results by genetic and cultivation-based analyses.\n\nResultsQuantitative and qualitative analysis revealed that most of the microbial taxa are of human origin. Less than 25% of the prokaryotic signatures found in built environment (BE) samples originate from intact - and thus potentially living - cells, indicating that aerobic and stress resistant taxa display an apparent survival advantage. Although the dominant microbial fraction identified on the bathroom floors is composed of aerobes, we confirmed the presence of strictly anaerobic taxa, including methanogenic archaea, in PMA-treated samples. As methanogens are regarded as highly sensitive to aerobic conditions, oxygen-tolerance experiments were performed with human-associated isolates to validate their survival. These results show that these taxa have a limited but substantial ability to survive in the BE. We determined that human-associated methanogens can survive oxic conditions for at least 6 h.\n\nConclusionsThis study enabled us to collect strong evidence that supports the hypothesis that obligate anaerobic taxa can survive in the BE for a limited amount of time. This suggests that the BE serves as a potential source of anaerobic human commensals.",

We conducted a bioassay on Chinese cork oak (Quercus variabilis Blume) seedlings subjected to five-month N pulsing with 15NH4Cl (10.39 atom %) at 120 mg 15N plant-1 under the blue (48.5% blue, 33.7% green, and 17.8% red), red (14.6% blue, 71.7% red, 13.7% green), and green (17.4% blue, 26.2% red, 56.4% green) spectra provided by light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Half of the seedlings were fed twice a week using a 250 ppm N solution with added phosphorus, potassium, and micro-nutrients, while the other half received only distilled water. Neither treatment affected growth of height, diameter, or leaf area. Compared to the red light spectrum, the blue light treatment increased chlorophyll and soluble protein contents and glutamine synthetase (GS) activity, root N concentration, and N derived from the pulses. The green light spectrum induced more biomass to allocate to the roots and a higher percentage of N derived from internal reserves compared to the other two spectra. The 15N pulses demonstrated no interaction with spectra but weakened the reliance on N remobilization from acorns, strengthened biomass allocation to shoots, and induced higher chlorophyll content, GS activity, and N concentration. In conclusion, the red light spectrum should be avoided for Q. variabilis regenerations whose biomass allocation to underground organs are weakened under this condition.",

    "abstract": "A game of rock-paper-scissors is an interesting example of an interaction where none of the pure strategies strictly dominates all others, leading to a cyclic pattern. In this work, we consider an unstable version of rock-paper-scissors dynamics and allow individuals to make behavioural mistakes during the strategy execution. We show that such an assumption can break a cyclic relationship leading to a stable equilibrium emerging with only one strategy surviving. We consider two cases: completely random mistakes when individuals have no bias towards any strategy and a general form of mistakes. Then, we determine conditions for a strategy to dominate all other strategies. However, given that individuals who adopt a dominating strategy are still prone to behavioural mistakes in the observed behaviour, we may still observe extinct strategies. That is, behavioural mistakes in strategy execution stabilise evolutionary dynamics leading to an evolutionary stable and, potentially, mixed co-existence equilibrium.\n\nAuthor summaryA game of rock-paper-scissors is more than just a childrens game. This type of interactions is often used to describe competition among animals or humans. A special feature of such an interaction is that none of the pure strategies dominates, resulting in a cyclic pattern. However, in wild communities such interactions are rarely observed by biologists. Our results suggest that this lack of cyclicity may stem from imperfectness of interacting individuals. In other words, we show analytically that heterogeneity in behavioural patterns may break a cyclic relationship and lead to a stable equilibrium in pure or mixed strategies.",

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectiveNot everyone gets sick after an exposure to influenza A viruses (IAV). Although KLRD1 has been identified as a potential biomarker for influenza susceptibility, it remains unclear whether forecasting symptomatic flu infection based on pre-exposure host gene expression might be possible.\n\nMethodTo examine this hypothesis, we developed DeepFlu using the state-of-the-art deep learning approach on the human gene expression data infected with IAV subtype H1N1 or H3N2 viruses to forecast who would catch the flu prior to an exposure to IAV.\n\nResultsThe results indicated that such forecast is possible and, in other words, gene expression could reflect the strength of host immunity. In the leave-one-person-out cross-validation, DeepFlu based on deep neural network outperformed the models using convolutional neural network, random forest, or support vector machine, achieving 70.0% accuracy, 0.787 AUROC, and 0.758 AUPR for H1N1 and 73.8% accuracy, 0.847 AUROC, and 0.901 AUPR for H3N2. In the external validation, DeepFlu also reached 71.4% accuracy, 0.700 AUROC, and 0.723 AUPR for H1N1 and 73.5% accuracy, 0.732 AUROC, and 0.749 AUPR for H3N2, surpassing the KLRD1 biomarker. In addition, DeepFlu which was trained only by pre-exposure data worked the best than by other time spans and mixed training data of H1N1 and H3N2 did not necessarily enhance prediction. DeepFlu is available at https://github.com/ntou-compbio/DeepFlu.\n\nConclusionsDeepFlu is a prognostic tool that can moderately recognize individuals susceptible to the flu and may help prevent the spread of IAV.",

    "abstract": "Increasing methionine availability in dairy cow diets during the first third of lactation may enhance their performance and health. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of supplementing rumen-protected methionine (RPMet) in a lactation diet containing adequate protein and energy levels. Seventy-six multiparous Holstein cows (39.1 {+/-} 6.8 kg of milk/d and 65 {+/-} 28 DIM) were assigned to 1 of 2 dietary treatments (38/treatment) according to a randomized complete block design with a 2-wk (covariate) and 10-wk experimental period. Treatments were a basal diet (CON; 3.77 Lys:1Met); and CON + 14 g RPMet (2.97 Lys:1 Met). Individual milk samples were taken every 2 weeks to determine milk composition. Blood was collected from 24 cows on d+30 d to measure plasma AA levels. Body weight and body condition score (BCS) were measured at the beginning and the end of the experiment. The SM diet promoted higher milk yield (41.7 vs. 40.1 kg/d; P = 0.026), energy-corrected milk yield (41.0 vs. 38.0 kg/d; P [&le;] 0.01), milk protein yield (1.30 vs. 1.18 kg/d; P [&le;] 0.01), and milk fat yield (1.42 vs. 1.29 kg/d; P = 0.02). Higher milk protein (3.14% vs. 2.97%; P [&le;] 0.01) and casein (2.39% vs. 2.28%; P[&le;] 0.01) and a trend (P = 0.06) for higher milk fat % (3.41% vs. 3.21%) were also observed. Both diets resulted in similar body weight, but CON-fed cows tended (P = 0.08) to have higher BCS. Higher plasma methionine levels were determined with SM compared with CON (29.6 vs. 18.4 M; P < 0.01), but lysine and histidine were not different. Dietary supplementation of RPM improved productive performance by increasing milk yield and milk components yields, suggesting better dietary AA utilization when Met levels are adjusted in Lys-adequate lactation diets.",

Dormancy has become a significant constraint for lowering potato production that hinders the possibility of growing two crops per year. An experiment was conducted from February to April 2020, where two major potato varieties (Desiree and Cardinal) were treated with four concentrations of Thiourea (0, 1, 2, and 3%) in a two factorial completely randomized block design with three replications. Results showed that Thiourea has a significant effect on all observed attributes as per varieties of potato. For Desiree variety, Thiourea (1%) decreased breaking of dormancy by 22 days compared to control (Desiree*Thiourea 0%) and produced the longest average sprout of 7.36cm at 49 days after treatment (DAT). On the other hand, for the Cardinal variety, Thiourea (3%) decreased tuber dormancy by 27 days compared to control (Cardinal*Thiourea 0%) and produced a sprout of 7.75 cm at 49 DAT.

    "abstract": "In the real world, many relationships between events are uncertain and probabilistic. Uncertainty is also likely to be a more common feature of daily experience for youth because they have less experience to draw from than adults. Some studies suggests probabilistic learning may be inefficient in youth compared to adults [1], while others suggest it may be more efficient in youth that are in mid adolescence [2, 3]. Here we used a probabilistic reinforcement learning task to test how youth age 8-17 (N = 187) and adults age 18-30 (N = 110) learn about stable probabilistic contingencies. Performance increased with age through early-twenties, then stabilized. Using hierarchical Bayesian methods to fit computational reinforcement learning models, we show that all participants performance was better explained by models in which negative outcomes had minimal to no impact on learning. The performance increase over age was driven by 1) an increase in learning rate (i.e. decrease in integration time horizon); 2) a decrease in noisy/exploratory choices. In mid-adolescence age 13-15, salivary testosterone and learning rate were positively related. We discuss our findings in the context of other studies and hypotheses about adolescent brain development.\n\nAuthor summaryAdolescence is a time of great uncertainty. It is also a critical time for brain development, learning, and decision making in social and educational domains. There are currently contradictory findings about learning in adolescence. We sought to better isolate how learning from stable probabilistic contingencies changes during adolescence with a task that previously showed interesting results in adolescents. We collected a relatively large sample size (297 participants) across a wide age range (8-30), to trace the adolescent developmental trajectory of learning under stable but uncertain conditions. We found that age in our sample was positively associated with higher learning rates and lower choice exploration. Within narrow age bins, we found that higher saliva testosterone levels were associated with higher learning rates in participants age 13-15 years. These findings can help us better isolate the trajectory of maturation of core learning and decision making processes during adolescence.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism underlying the emergence of seizures is one of the most important unresolved issues in epilepsy research. In this paper, we study how perturbations, exogenous of endogenous, may promote or delay seizure emergence. To this aim, due to the increasingly adopted view of epileptic dynamics in terms of slow-fast systems, we perform a theoretical analysis of the phase response of a generic relaxation oscillator. As relaxation oscillators are effectively bistable systems at the fast time scale, it is intuitive that perturbations of the non-seizing state with a suitable direction and amplitude may cause an immediate transition to seizure. By contrast, and perhaps less intuitively, smaller amplitude perturbations have been found to delay the spontaneous seizure initiation. By studying the isochrons of relaxation oscillators, we show that this is a generic phenomenon, with the size of such delay depending on the slow flow component. Therefore, depending on perturbation amplitudes, frequency and timing, a train of perturbations causes an occurrence increase, decrease or complete suppression of seizures. This dependence lends itself to analysis and mechanistic understanding through methods outlined in this paper. We illustrate this methodology by computing the isochrons, phase response curves and the response to perturbations in several epileptic models possessing different slow vector fields. While our theoretical results are applicable to any planar relaxation oscillator, in the motivating context of epilepsy they elucidate mechanisms of triggering and abating seizures, thus suggesting stimulation strategies with effects ranging from mere delaying to full suppression of seizures.\n\nAuthor summaryDespite its simplicity, the modelling of epileptic dynamics as a slow-fast transition between low and high activity states mediated by some slow feedback variable is a relatively novel albeit fruitful approach. This study is the first, to our knowledge, characterizing the response of such slow-fast models of epileptic brain to perturbations by computing its isochrons. Besides its numerical computation, we theoretically determine which factors shape the geometry of isochrons for planar slow-fast oscillators. As a consequence, we introduce a theoretical approach providing a clear understanding of the response of perturbations of slow-fast oscillators. Within the epilepsy context, this elucidates the origin of the contradictory role of interictal epileptiform discharges in the transition to seizure, manifested by both pro-convulsive and anti-convulsive effect depending on the amplitude, frequency and timing. More generally, this paper provides theoretical framework highlighting the role of the of the slow flow component on the response to perturbations in relaxation oscillators, pointing to the general phenomena in such slow-fast oscillators ubiquitous in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "The human zoonotic pathogen Escherichia coli O157 is defined by its extensive prophage repertoire including those that encode Shiga toxin, the factor responsible for inducing life-threatening pathology in humans. As well as introducing genes that can contribute to the virulence of a strain, prophage can enable the generation of large-chromosomal rearrangements (LCRs) by homologous recombination. This work examines the types and frequencies of LCRs across the major lineages of the O157 serogroup and defines the phenotypic consequences of specific structural variants. We demonstrate that LCRs are a major source of genomic variation across all lineages of E. coli O157 and by using both optical mapping and ONT long-read sequencing demonstrate that LCRs are generated in laboratory cultures started from a single colony and particular variants are selected during animal colonisation. LCRs are biased towards the terminus region of the genome and are bounded by specific prophages that share large regions of sequence homology associated with the recombinational activity. RNA transcriptional profiling and phenotyping of specific structural variants indicated that important virulence phenotypes such as Shiga toxin production, type 3 secretion and motility are affected by LCRs. In summary, E. coli O157 has acquired multiple prophage regions over time that act as genome engineers to continually produce structural variants of the genome. This structural variation is a form of epigenetic regulation that generates sub-population phenotypic heterogeneity with important implications for bacterial adaptation and survival.\n\nAuthor SummaryEscherichia coli has an  open genome and has acquired genetic information over evolutionary time, often in the form of bacteriophages that integrate into the bacterial genome (prophages). E. coli O157 is a clonal serogroup that is found primarily in ruminants such as cattle but can cause life-threatening infections in humans. E. coli O157 isolates contain multiple prophages including those that encode Shiga-like toxins which are responsible for the more serious disease associated with human infections. We show in this study that many of these prophages exhibit large regions of sequence similarity that allow rearrangements to occur in the genome generating structural variants. These occur routinely during bacterial culture in the laboratory and the variants are detected during animal colonization. The variants generated can give the bacteria altered phenotypes, such as increased motility or toxin production which can be selected in specific environments and therefore represent a highly dynamic mechanism to generate variation in bacterial populations without a change in overall gene content.",
