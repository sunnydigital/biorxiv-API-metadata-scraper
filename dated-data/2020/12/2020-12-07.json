    "abstract": "Tumor metastasis remains the main cause of breast cancer-related deaths, especially the later breast cancer distant metastasis. This study assessed CD44-/CD24- tumor cells in 576 tissue specimens for associations with clinicopathological features and metastasis and then investigated the underlying molecular events. The data showed that level of CD44-/CD24- cells was associated with later postoperative distant tumor metastasis. Furthermore, CD44-/CD24- triple negative cells could spontaneously convert into CD44+/CD24- cancer stem cells (CSCs) with properties similar to CD44+/CD24- CSCs from parental MDA-MB-231 cells in terms of gene expression, tumor cell xenograft formation, and lung metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Single-cell RNA sequencing identified RHBDL2 as a regulator that enhanced spontaneous CD44+/CD24- CSC conversion, whereas knockdown of RHBDL2 expression inhibited YAP/NF-{kappa}B signaling and blocked spontaneous CD44-/CD24- cell conversion to CSCs. These data suggested that the level of CD44-/CD24- tumor cells could predict breast cancer prognosis, metastasis, and response to adjuvant therapy.",

    "abstract": "An examination is presented of scientific research publication trends during the global coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. After reviewing the timing of the emergence of the pandemic in 2020 and the growth of governmental responses, available secondary sources are used to highlight impacts of COVID-19 on scientific research. A bibliometric analysis is then undertaken to analyze developments in COVID-19 related scientific publications through to October of 2020 by broad trends, fields, countries, and organizations. Two publication data sources are used: PubMed and the Web of Science.\n\nWhile there has been a massive absolute increase in PubMed and Web of Science papers directly focused on COVID-19 topics, especially in medical, biological science, and public health fields, this is still a relatively small proportion of publication outputs across all fields of science. Using Web of Science publication data, the paper examines the extent to which researchers across all fields of science have pivoted their research outputs to focus on topics related to COVID-19. A COVID-19 research pivot is defined as the extent to which the proportion of output in a particular research field has shifted to a focus on COVID-19 topics in 2020 (to date) compared with 2019. Significant variations are found by specific fields (identified by Web of Science Subject Categories). In a top quintile of fields, not only in medical specialties, biomedical sciences, and public health but also in subjects in social sciences and arts and humanities, there are relatively high to medium research pivots. In lower quintiles, including other subjects in science, social science, and arts and humanities, low to zero COVID-19 research pivoting is identified.\n\nIn a new Appendix to the paper, an updated analysis is provided through to mid-April 2022.\n\nCitationShapira, P. \"Scientific publications and COVID-19 \"research pivots\" during the pandemic: An initial bibliometric analysis,\" bioRxiv 2020.12.06.413682; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.06.413682\n\nVersion NotesVersion 1: Original paper, completed on December 6, 2020; posted at bioRxiv on December 7, 2020.\n\nVersion 2: Minor grammar items corrected.\n\nVersion 3: Updated bibliometric analysis through to mid-April 2022 added on April 29, 2022, as new Appendix 2.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResting state functional connectivity (rsFC) offers promise for individualizing stimulation targets for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) treatments. However current targeting approaches do not account for non-focal TMS effects or large-scale connectivity patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel targeting optimization approach that combines whole-brain rsFC and electric-field (e-field) modelling to identify single-subject, symptom-specific TMS targets.\n\nMethodsIn this proof of concept study, we recruited 91 anxious misery (AM) patients and 25 controls. We measured depression symptoms (MADRS/HAMD) and recorded rsFC. We used a PCA regression to predict symptoms from rsFC and estimate the parameter vector, for input into our e-field augmented model. We modeled 17 left dlPFC and 7 M1 sites using 24 equally spaced coil orientations. We computed single-subject predicted {Delta}MADRS/HAMD scores for each site/orientation using the e-field augmented model, which comprises a linear combination of the following elementwise products 1) the estimated connectivity/symptom coefficients, 2) a vectorized e-field model for site/orientation, 3) the pre-treatment rsFC matrix, scaled by a proportionality constant.\n\nResultsIn AM patients, our pre-stimulation connectivity-based model predicted a significant decrease depression for sites near BA46, but not M1 for coil orientations perpendicular to the cortical gyrus. In control subjects, no site/orientation combination showed a significant predicted change.\n\nDiscussionThese results corroborate previous work suggesting the efficacy of left dlPFC stimulation for depression treatment, and predict better outcomes with individualized targeting. They also suggest that our novel connectivity-based e-field modelling approach may effectively identify potential TMS treatment responders and individualize TMS targeting to maximize the therapeutic impact.",

    "abstract": "We investigated how entorhinal grid cells represent volumetric (three-dimensional) space. On a flat surface, grid cell firing fields are circular and arranged in a close-packed hexagonal array. In three dimensions, theoretical and computational work suggests that the most efficient configuration would be a regular close packing of spherical fields. We report that in rats exploring a cubic lattice, grid cells were spatially stable and maintained normal directional modulation, theta modulation and spike dynamics. However, while the majority of grid fields were spherical, they were irregularly arranged, even when only fields abutting the lower surface (equivalent to the floor) were considered. Thus, grid organization is shaped by the environments movement affordances, and may not need to be regular to support spatial computations.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIn rats exploring a volumetric space, grid cells are spatially modulated but their firing fields are irregularly arranged.",

    "abstract": "In rodents, morphine analgesia is influenced by sex. However, conflicting results exist regarding the interaction between sex and morphine analgesic tolerance. Morphine is metabolized in the liver and brain into morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G). Sex differences in morphine metabolism and differential metabolic adaptations during tolerance development might explain the behavioral discrepancies. The present article investigates the differences in peripheral and central morphine metabolism after acute and chronic morphine treatment in male and female mice.\n\nThe first experiment aimed to determine whether morphine analgesia and tolerance differ between male and female mice using the tail-immersion test. The second experiment evaluated morphine and M3G metabolic kinetics in the blood using LC-MS/MS. Morphine and M3G were also quantified in several central nervous system (CNS) regions after acute and chronic morphine treatment. Finally, the blood-brain barrier permeability of M3G was assessed in male and female mice.\n\nThis study demonstrated that female mice showed weaker morphine analgesia. In addition, tolerance appeared earlier in females but the sex discrepancies observed seemed to be due to the initial differences in morphine analgesia rather than to sex-specific mechanisms involving metabolism. Additionally, compared to male mice, female mice showed higher levels of M3G in the blood and in several CNS regions, whereas lower levels of morphine were observed in these brain regions. These differences are attributable mainly to morphine central metabolism, which differed between males and females in pain-related brain regions, consistent with the weaker analgesic effect in females. However, the role of morphine metabolism in analgesic tolerance seems rather limited.",

    "abstract": "Theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) has become a standard non-invasive technique to induce offline changes in cortical excitability in human volunteers. Yet, TBS suffers from a high variability across subjects. A better knowledge about how TBS affects neural activity in vivo could uncover its mechanisms of action and ultimately allow its mainstream use in basic science and clinical applications. To address this issue, we applied continuous TBS (cTBS, 300 pulses) in awake behaving rhesus monkeys and quantified its after-effects on neuronal recordings and behavior. Guided by anatomical MRI, we recorded single-cell activity in parietal area PFG during passive fixation of real-world objects. Overall, we observed a pronounced, long-lasting and highly reproducible reduction in neuronal excitability after cTBS in individual parietal neurons, with some neurons exhibiting periods of hyperexcitability during the recovery phase. We applied the same stimulation protocol during visually-guided grasping of objects, and observed a significant grasping impairment. These results provide the first experimental evidence on the effects of cTBS on single neurons in awake behaving monkeys.",

    "abstract": "The ability to associate neutral stimuli with valence information and to store these associations as memories forms the basis for decision making. To determine the underlying computational principles, we build a realistic computational model of a central decision module within the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), the flys center for learning and memory. Our model combines the electron microscopy-based architecture of one MB output neuron (MBON-3), the synaptic connectivity of its 948 presynaptic Kenyon cells (KCs), and its membrane properties obtained from patch-clamp recordings. We show that this neuron is electrotonically compact and that synaptic input corresponding to simulated odor input robustly drives its spiking behavior. Therefore, sparse innervation by KCs can efficiently control and modulate MBON activity in response to learning with minimal requirements on the specificity of synaptic localization. This architecture allows efficient storage of large numbers of memories using the flexible stochastic connectivity of the circuit.",

    "abstract": "The axons forming the corpus callosum enable integration and coordination of cognitive processing between the cerebral hemispheres. In the aging human brain, these functions are affected by progressive axon and myelin deteriorations, which results in a substantial atrophy of the midsagittal corpus callosum in old age. In non-human primates, these degenerative processes are less pronounced as previous morphometric studies on capuchin monkey, rhesus monkeys, and chimpanzees do not find old-age callosal atrophy. The objective of the present study was to extend these previous findings by studying the aging trajectory of the corpus callosum of the olive baboon (Papio anubis) across the lifespan. For this purpose, total relative (to forebrain volume) midsagittal area, subsectional area, and regional thickness of the corpus callosum was assessed in 91 male and female animals using non-invasive MRI-based morphometry. The studied age range was 2.5 to 26.6 years, and the sample included 11 old-age animals (above the age of 20 years). Fitting lifespan trajectories using general additive modelling (GAM) we found that the relative area of the total corpus callosum and the anterior subsection follow a positive linear trajectory. That is, both measures increased slowly but continuously from childhood into old age, and no stagnation of growth or decline was observed in old age. Thus, comparable with all other non-human primates studied to-date, baboons do not show callosal atrophy in old age. This observation lends supports to the notion that atrophy of the corpus callosum is a unique characteristic of human brain aging.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, there has been debate about the effectiveness of treatments from different fields, such as neurostimulation, neurofeedback, brain training, and pharmacotherapy. This debate has been fuelled by contradictory and nuanced experimental findings. Notably, the effectiveness of a given treatment is commonly evaluated by comparing the effect of the active treatment versus the placebo on human health and/or behaviour. However, this approach neglects the individuals subjective experience of the type of treatment s/he received in establishing treatment efficacy. Here, we show that individual differences in subjective treatment--the thought of receiving the active or placebo condition during an experiment--can explain variability in outcomes better than the actual treatment. We analysed four independent datasets (N=387 participants), including clinical patients and healthy adults from different age groups who were exposed to different neurostimulation treatments (transcranial magnetic stimulation: Study 1 & 2; transcranial direct current stimulation: Study 3 & 4). Our findings consistently show that the inclusion of subjective treatment provides a better model fit than objective treatment alone--the condition to which participants are assigned in the experiment. These results demonstrate the significant contribution of subjective experience in explaining the variability of clinical, cognitive and behavioural outcomes. Based on these findings, we advocate for existing and future studies in clinical and non-clinical research to start accounting for participants subjective beliefs when assessing the efficacy of treatments. This approach will be crucial in providing a more accurate estimation of the treatment effect and its source, allowing the development of effective and reproducible interventions.\n\nSignificance statementWe demonstrate that individual differences in subjective treatment--the belief of receiving the active or placebo condition during an experiment--can explain variability in research outcomes better than objective treatment, the actual treatment to which participants are assigned. Even though it is a standard practice for intervention studies to collect data on subjective treatment, its contribution to research outcomes has been overlooked. By demonstrating the explanatory power of subjective treatment beyond objective treatment in four independent datasets, we show its potential to provide further insights into the effectiveness of different interventions. We, therefore, encourage researchers to adopt our approach in existing and new studies, to improve experimental design and ultimately increase the rigour and robustness of clinical and non-clinical interventions.\n\nCredit Author StatementLuisa Fassi: Formal analysis; Conceptualisation; Data curation; Methodology; Investigation; Writing - original\n\nShachar Hochman: Formal analysis; Data curation; Methodology; Investigation; Writing - review and editing\n\nDaniel M.

    "abstract": "Solutions to challenging inference problems are often subject to a fundamental trade-off between bias (being systematically wrong) that is minimized with complex inference strategies and variance (being oversensitive to uncertain observations) that is minimized with simple inference strategies. However, this trade-off is based on the assumption that the strategies being considered are optimal for their given complexity and thus has unclear relevance to the frequently suboptimal inference strategies used by humans. We examined inference problems involving rare, asymmetrically available evidence, which a large population of human subjects solved using a diverse set of strategies that were suboptimal relative to the Bayesian ideal observer. These suboptimal strategies reflected an inversion of the classic bias-variance trade-off: subjects who used more complex, but imperfect, Bayesian-like strategies tended to have lower variance but high bias because of incorrect tuning to latent task features, whereas subjects who used simpler heuristic strategies tended to have higher variance because they operated more directly on the observed samples but displayed weaker, near-normative bias. Our results yield new insights into the principles that govern individual differences in behavior that depends on rare-event inference, and, more generally, about the information-processing trade-offs that are sensitive to not just the complexity, but also the optimality of the inference process.",

    "abstract": "Tauopathy is characterised by neuronal dysfunction and degeneration occurring as a result of changes to the microtubule associated protein tau. The neuronal changes evident in Tauopathy bear striking morphological resemblance to those reported in models of Wallerian degeneration. The mechanisms underpinning Wallerian degeneration are not fully understood although it can be delayed by the expression of the slow Wallerian degeneration (WldS) protein, which has also been demonstrated to delay axonal degeneration in some models of neurodegenerative disease. Given the morphological similarities between tauopathy and Wallerian degeneration, this study investigated whether tau-mediated phenotypes can be modulated by expression of WldS. In a Drosophila model of tauopathy in which expression of human Tau protein (hTau0N3R) leads to progressive age-dependent phenotypes, activation of the pathway downstream of WldS completely suppressed tau-mediated degeneration. This protective effect was evident even if the pathway downstream of WldS was activated several weeks after hTau-mediated degeneration had become established. In contrast, WldS expression without activation of the downstream protective pathway did not rescue tau-mediated degeneration in adults or improve tau-mediated neuronal dysfunction including deficits in axonal transport, synaptic alterations and locomotor behaviour in hTau0N3R -expressing larvae. This collectively implies that the pathway mediating the protective effect of WldS intersects with the mechanism(s) of degeneration initiated by hTau and can effectively halt tau-mediated degeneration at both early and late stages. Understanding the mechanisms underpinning this protection could identify much-needed disease-modifying targets for tauopathies.",

Recent phosphoproteomics analyses revealed that members of the SR and hnRNP families of splicing regulatory proteins are dynamically post-translationally modified in infected macrophages. To begin to test if these splicing factors play a privileged role in controlling the innate immune transcriptome, we analyzed steady state gene expression and alternatively spliced isoform production in ten SR/hnRNP knockdown RAW 264.7 macrophage cell lines following infection with the bacterial pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella). We identified thousands of transcripts whose abundance was increased or decreased by SR/hnRNP knockdown in macrophages. We observed that different SR/hnRNPs control the expression of distinct gene regulons in uninfected and Salmonella-infected macrophages, with several key innate immune genes (Nos2, Mx1, Il1a) relying on multiple SR/hnRNPs to maintain proper induction and/or repression. Knockdown of SR/hnRNPs promoted differential isoform usage (DIU) for a number of key immune sensors and signaling molecules and many of these splicing changes were again, distinct in uninfected and Salmonella-infected macrophages. Finally, after observing a surprising degree of similarity between the DEGs and DIUs in hnRNP K and U knockdown macrophages, we found that these cells are better able to restrict vesicular stomatitis virus replication than control cells, supporting a role for these hnRNPs in controlling infection outcomes in macrophages ex vivo. Based on these findings, we conclude that many innate immune genes have evolved to rely on one or more splicing regulatory factors to ensure the proper timing and magnitude of their induction, bolstering a model wherein pre-mRNA splicing is a critical regulatory node in the innate immune response.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFibrillar adhesins are long multidomain proteins attached at the cell surface and composed of at least one adhesive domain and multiple tandemly repeated domains, which build an elongated stalk that projects the adhesive domain beyond the bacterial cell surface. They are an important yet understudied class of proteins that mediate interactions of bacteria with their environment. This study aims to characterize fibrillar adhesins in a wide range of bacterial phyla and to identify new fibrillar adhesin-like proteins to improve our understanding of host-bacteria interactions.\n\nResultsBy careful search for fibrillar adhesins in the literature and by computational analysis we identified 75 stalk domains and 24 adhesive domains. Based on the presence of these domains in the UniProt Reference Proteomes database, we identified and analysed 3,388 fibrillar adhesin-like proteins across species of the most common bacterial phyla. We found that the bacterial proteomes with the highest fraction of fibrillar adhesins include several known pathogens. We further enumerate the adhesive and stalk domain combinations found in nature and demonstrate that fibrillar adhesins have complex and variable domain architectures, which differ across species. By analysing the domain architecture of fibrillar adhesins we show that in Gram positive bacteria adhesive domains are mostly positioned at the N-terminus of the protein with the cell surface anchor at the C-terminus, while their positions are more variable in Gram negative bacteria. We provide an open repository of fibrillar adhesin-like proteins and domains to facilitate downstream studies of this class of bacterial surface proteins.\n\nConclusionThis study provides a domain-based characterization of fibrillar adhesins and demonstrates that they are widely found across the main bacterial phyla. We have discovered numerous novel fibrillar adhesins and improved the understanding of how pathogens might adhere to and subsequently invade into host cells.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is a major and progressive neurodegenerative disorder, yet the biological mechanisms involved in its aetiology are poorly understood. Evidence links this disorder with mitochondrial dysfunction and/or impaired lysosomal degradation - key features of the autophagy of mitochondria, known as mitophagy. Here we investigated the role of LRRK2, a protein kinase frequently mutated in PD, on this process in vivo. Using mitophagy and autophagy reporter mice, bearing either knockout of LRRK2 or expressing the pathogenic kinase-activating G2019S LRRK2 mutation, we found that basal mitophagy was specifically altered in clinically relevant cells and tissues. Our data show that basal mitophagy inversely correlates with LRRK2 kinase activity in vivo. In support of this, use of distinct LRRK2 kinase inhibitors in cells increased basal mitophagy, and a CNS penetrant LRRK2 kinase inhibitor, GSK3357679A, rescued the mitophagy defects observed in LRRK2 G2019S mice. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that pathogenic LRRK2 directly impairs basal mitophagy, a process with strong links to idiopathic Parkinsons disease, and demonstrates that pharmacological inhibition of LRRK2 is a rational mitophagy-rescue approach and potential PD therapy.",

    "abstract": "Type 1 diabetes is characterized by the autoimmune destruction of insulin secreting {beta} cells. Genetic variations upstream at the insulin (INS) locus contribute to ~10% of type 1 diabetes heritable risk. Multiple studies showed an association between rs3842753 C/C genotype and type 1 diabetes susceptibility, but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. To date, no large-scale studies have looked at the effect of genetic variation at rs3842753 on INS mRNA at the single cell level. We aligned all human islet single cell RNA sequencing datasets available to us in 2020 to the reference genome GRCh38.98 and genotyped rs3842753, integrating 2315 {beta} cells and 1223 {beta}-like cells from 13 A/A protected donors, 23 A/C heterozygous donors, and 35 C/C at-risk donors, including adults without diabetes and with type 2 diabetes. INS expression mean and variance were significantly higher in single {beta} cells from females compared with males. Comparing across {beta} cells and {beta}-like cells, we found that rs3842753 C containing cells (either homozygous or heterozygous) had the highest INS expression. We also found that {beta} cells with the rs3842753 C allele had significantly higher ER stress marker gene expression compared to the A/A homozygous genotype. These findings support the emerging concept that inherited risk of type 1 diabetes may be associated with inborn, persistent elevated insulin production which may lead to {beta} cell ER stress and fragility.",

    "abstract": "For organisms that respond to environmental stimuli using taxes, reversal of the tactic sign should be tightly regulated for survival. The biciliate green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is an excellent model for studying reversal between positive and negative phototaxis. C. reinhardtii cells change swimming direction by modulating the balance of beating forces between their two cilia after photoreception at the eyespot; however, it remains unknown how they reverse phototactic sign. In this study, we observed cells undergoing phototactic turns with a high-speed camera and found that two key factors determine the phototactic sign: which of the two cilia beats more strongly for phototactic turning and when the strong beating starts. The timing of the strong ciliary beating is suggested to be regulated by ROS-regulated switching between the light-on and light-off responses at the eyespot, which leads to the switching between positive and negative phototaxis. This idea is supported by a mathematical model that introduces the timing of the strong ciliary beating after photoreception.",

On individual plants, typically only a subset of interactions is realized. The stochasticity of realized interactions leads to uncertainty of attack on individual plants and is likely to determine adaptiveness of plant defence strategies. Here, we show that across 12 plant species in two phylogenetic lineages of the Brassicaceae, variation in realized herbivore communities reveals a phylogenetic signal in the uncertainty of attack on individual plants. Individual plants of Brassicaceae Lineage II were attacked by a larger number of herbivore species from a larger species pool, resulting in a higher uncertainty of realized antagonistic interactions compared to plants in Lineage I. We argue that uncertainty of attack in terms of realized interactions on individual plants is ecologically relevant and must therefore be considered in the evolution of plant defences.",

    "abstract": "There is considerable inter-individual and inter-population variability in response to viruses. The potential of monocytes to elicit type-I interferon responses has attracted attention to their role in viral infections. Here, we use an ex vivo model to characterize the role of cellular heterogeneity in human variation of monocyte responses to influenza A virus (IAV) exposure. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we show widespread inter-individual variability in the percentage of IAV-infected monocytes. We show that cells escaping viral infection display increased mRNA expression of type-I interferon stimulated genes and decreased expression of ribosomal genes, relative to both infected cells and those never exposed to IAV. While this host defense strategy is shared between CD16+/CD16- monocytes, we also uncover CD16+-specific mRNA expression of IL6 and TNF in response to IAV, and a stronger resistance of CD16+ monocytes to IAV infection. Notably, individuals with high cellular susceptibility to IAV are characterized by a lower activation at basal state of an IRF/STAT-induced transcriptional network, which includes antiviral genes such as IFITM3, MX1, and OAS3. Finally, using flow cytometry and bulk RNA-sequencing across 200 individuals of African and European ancestry, we observe a higher number of CD16+ monocytes and lower susceptibility to IAV infection among monocytes from individuals of African-descent. Collectively, our results reveal the effects of IAV infection on the transcriptional landscape of human monocytes and highlight previously unappreciated differences in cellular susceptibility to IAV infection between individuals of African and European ancestry, which may account for the greater susceptibility of Africans to severe influenza.\n\nSignificance StatementMonocytes may play a critical role during severe viral infections. Our study tackles how heterogeneity in monocyte subsets and activation contributes to shape individual differences in the transcriptional response to viral infections. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing, we reveal heterogeneity in monocyte susceptibility to IAV infection, both between CD16+/CD16- monocytes and across individuals, driven by differences in basal activation of an IRF/STAT-induced antiviral program. Furthermore, we show a decreased ability of IAV to infect and replicate in monocytes from African-ancestry individuals, with possible implications for antigen presentation and lymphocyte activation. These results highlight the importance of early cellular activation in determining an individuals innate immune response to viral infection.",

LncRNAs divergently distribute across chromosomes, independent of protein-coding regions. Their transcriptions barely initiate on promoters through polymerase II, but mostly on enhancers. Yet conventional enhancer activators(e.g. H3K4me1) only account for a small proportion of lncRNA activation, suggesting alternatively unknown mechanisms initiating the majority of lncRNAs. Meanwhile, lncRNA-self regulation also notably contributes to lncRNA activation. LncRNAs trans-regulate broad bioprocesses, including transcription and RNA processing, cell cycle, respiration, response to stress, chromatin organization, post-translational modification, and development. Overall lncRNAs govern their owned regime distinctive from proteins.",

Although mechanistic understanding of DNA cleavage in the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been guided by crystallographic structures and single-molecule FRET experiments, the role of conformational plasticity within its DNA recognition lobe (REC) for target accuracy remains elusive. Through NMR analysis of milliseconds-timescale dynamics, we show that the REC3 domain exchanges between a major, closed and a minor, open conformation. We find that a single mutation in the HiFi Cas9 variant (R691A) increases conformational dynamics in REC3, eliciting a global transition to the open conformation which is regulated by an intramolecular salt-bridge network. These observations suggest a mechanism for reduced off-target recognition by switching on a global conformational exchange process to allow REC3 scanning for proper base pairing.

Using these ML models and a novel scoring algorithm to modify the signatures of patients, we evaluate whether a given sample that was formerly classified as diseased, could be predicted as normal following drug treatment simulation. We then use this technique as a proxy for the identification of potential drug candidates.

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin is a common posttranslational modification canonically associated with targeting proteins to the 26S proteasome for degradation and also plays a role in numerous other non-degradative cellular processes. Ubiquitination at certain sites destabilizes the substrate protein, with consequences for proteasomal processing, while ubiquitination at other sites has little energetic effect. How this site specificity--and, by extension, the myriad effects of ubiquitination on substrate proteins--arises remains unknown. Here, we systematically characterize the atomic-level effects of ubiquitination at various sites on a model protein, barstar, using a combination of NMR, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, and molecular dynamics simulation. We find that, regardless of the site of modification, ubiquitination does not induce large structural rearrangements in the substrate. Destabilizing modifications, however, increase fluctuations from the native state resulting in exposure of the substrates C terminus. Both of the sites occur in regions of barstar with relatively high conformational flexibility. Destabilization, however, appears to occur through different thermodynamic mechanisms, involving a reduction in entropy in one case and a loss in enthalpy in another. By contrast, ubiquitination at a non-destabilizing site protects the substrate C terminus through intermittent formation of a structural motif with the last three residues of ubiquitin. Thus, the biophysical effects of ubiquitination at a given site depend greatly on local context. Taken together, our results reveal how a single post-translational modification can generate a broad array of distinct effects, providing a framework to guide the design of proteins and therapeutics with desired degradation and quality-control properties. (248 words)\n\nSignificance StatementFluctuations on a protein energy landscapes encode the mechanistic basis for vital biological processes not always evident from static structures alone. Ubiquitination, a key posttranslational modification, can affect a proteins energy landscape with consequences for proteasomal degradation, but the molecular mechanisms driving ubiquitin-induced energetic changes remain elusive. Here, we systematically characterize the energetic effects of ubiquitination at three sites on a model protein. We find that distinct thermodynamic mechanisms can produce the same outcome of ubiquitin-induced destabilization at sensitive sites. At a non-sensitive site, we observe formation of a substrate-ubiquitin interaction that may serve to protect against destabilization. This work will enable development of predictive models of the effect of ubiquitin at any given site on a protein with implications for understanding and engineering regulated ubiquitin signaling and protein quality control in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Strigolactones are phytohormones involved in shoot branching and hypocotyl elongation. The latter phenomenon was addressed herein by the exogenous application of a synthetic strigolactone GR24 and an inhibitor of strigolactone biosynthesis TIS108 on hypocotyls of wild type Arabidopsis and a strigolactone signalling mutant max2-1 (more axillary growth 2-1). Owing to the interdependence between light and strigolactone signalling, the present work was extended to seedling cultivation under a standard light/dark regime, or under continuous darkness. Given the essential role of the cortical microtubules in cell elongation, their organization and dynamics were characterized under the conditions of altered strigolactone signalling using fluorescence microscopy methods with different spatiotemporal capacities such as confocal laser scanning microscopy and structured illumination microscopy. It was found that the strigolactone-dependent inhibition of hypocotyl elongation correlated with changes in cortical microtubule organization and dynamics, visualized in living wild type and max2-1 seedlings stably expressing genetically-encoded fluorescent molecular markers for microtubules. Quantitative analysis of microscopic datasets revealed that chemical and/or genetic manipulation of strigolactone signalling affected microtubule remodelling, especially under light conditions. The application of GR24 and TIS108 in dark conditions partially alleviated cytoskeletal rearrangement, suggesting a new mechanistic connection between the cytoskeletal behaviour and the light-dependence of strigolactone signalling.\n\nHighlightStrigolactones regulate organization and dynamics of cortical microtubules in hypocotyl cells, which contributes to the light-mediated inhibition of hypocotyl growth in Arabidopsis seedlings.",

Identification of primate sensory neuron types is critical for understanding the cellular origin and heritability of chronic pain. However, molecular insights into the primate sensory neurons are missing. Here we classify non-human primate dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons based on their transcriptome and map human pain heritability to neuronal types. First, we identified cell correlates between two major datasets for mouse sensory neuron types. Machine learning exposes an overall cross-species conservation of somatosensory neurons between primate and mouse, although with differences at individual gene level, highlighting the importance of primate data for clinical translation. We map genomic loci associated with chronic pain in human onto primate sensory neuron types to identify the cellular origin of human chronic pain. Genome-wide associations for chronic pain converge on two different neuronal types distributed between pain disorders that display different genetic susceptibilities, suggesting both unique and shared mechanisms between different pain conditions.",

    "abstract": "Paralinguistic features of the speaker, such as prosody, temp, loudness, and dynamics, are an important marker of a persons emotional state. The deficit of processing of emotional prosody could be preferably associated with the impairments in individuals with ASDs social behavior. The following two groups of children participated in our study: 30 preschoolers from 4 to 6 years old in the target group (39.1 {+/-} 6.4 scores by Childhood Autism Rating Scale), 24 preschoolers of the control group from 4 to 6 years in the control group. The prosody stimuli were the combination of syllables, said with intonations of \"joy,\" \"angry,\" \"sadness,\" \"fear,\" and \"calm.\" Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is used to analyze power spectrum density (PSD). The resulting normalized spectrum was integrated over unit width intervals in the range of interest (2 to 20 Hz with a step in 1Hz). Children with ASD, similarly to TD children, showed the most pronounced differenced of EEG in response to prosodics of fear and anger. The significant groups differences in PSD were detected for sad and joy intonations. Indexes of EEG differences between pleasure and painful intonations were significantly higher in the control group than children with ASD and between sadness and calm or joy and calm intonations. This paper makes up two main contributions: In general, we obtained that children with ASD have less response to a human voices emotional intonation. The physical characteristics of stimuli are more critical than a sign of emotions. The effect of EEG spectral power has hemisphere specialization in the healthy control group, but not in ASD children. Since spectral power for negative emotions in the target group is higher, we proposed that ASD children worse recognize positive emotions than negative emotions.",

    "abstract": "The enigmatic Chinese mountain cat, endemic to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, has a controversial taxonomic status, whether a true species or conspecific with the wildcat (Felis silvestris) and whether it may have contributed to the domestication of cats (F. s. catus) in Asia. Here, we sampled 270 domestic and wild cats across China, sequenced 51 nuclear genomes, 55 mitogenomes, and multi-locus regions from modern and museum specimens. Genome-wide phylogenies supported taxonomic classification of the Chinese mountain cat as wildcat subspecies, F. s. bieti. No involvement of F. s. bieti in cat domestication in East Asia was detected, confirming that domestic cats shared a single origin from the African wildcat (F. s. lybica). A complex hybridization scenario including ancient introgression from the Asiatic wildcat (F. s. ornata) to F. s. bieti, and contemporary gene flow between F. s. bieti and sympatric domestic cats in the Tibetan region, raises the prospect of disrupting the genetic integrity of F. s. bieti, an issue with profound conservation implications.",

The Spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is crucial to mediate viral entry into host cells; however, whether it can be cellularly pathogenic and contribute to pulmonary hyper-inflammations in COVID-19 is not well known.\n\nMethods and FindingsIn this study, we developed a Spike protein-pseudotyped (Spp) lentivirus with the proper tropism of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein on the surface and tracked down the fate of Spp in wild type C57BL/6J mice receiving intravenous injection of the virus. A lentivirus with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) was used as the control. Two hours post-infection (hpi), Spp showed more than 27-75 times more viral burden in the lungs than other organs; it also exhibited about 3-5 times more viral burden than VSV-G lentivirus in the lungs, liver, kidney and spleen. Acute pneumonia was evident in animals 24 hpi. Spp lentivirus was mainly found in LDLR+ macrophages and pneumocytes in the lungs, but not in MARC1+ macrophages. IL6, IL10, CD80 and PPAR-{gamma} were quickly upregulated in response to infection of Spp lentivirus in the lungs in vivo as well as in macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells in vitro. We further confirmed that forced expression of the Spike protein in RAW264.7 cells could significantly increase the mRNA levels of the same panel of inflammatory factors.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate that the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 alone can induce cellular pathology, e.g. activating macrophages and contributing to induction of acute inflammatory responses.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionHow cigarette smoke (CS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) affect severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and severity is controversial. We investigated the protein and mRNA expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor ACE2 and proteinase TMPRSS2 in lungs from COPD patients and controls, and lung tissue from mice exposed acutely and chronically to CS. Also, we investigated the effects of CS exposure on SARS-CoV-2 infection in human bronchial epithelial cells.\n\nMethodsIn Cohort 1, ACE2-positive cells were quantified by immunostaining in FFPE sections from both central and peripheral airways. In Cohort 2, we quantified pulmonary ACE2 protein levels by immunostaining and ELISA, and both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 mRNA levels by RT-qPCR. In C57BL/6 WT mice exposed to air or CS for up to 6 months, pulmonary ACE2 protein levels were quantified by triple immunofluorescence staining and ELISA. The effects of CS exposure on SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated after 72hr in vitro infection of Calu-3 cells. After SARS-CoV-2 infection, the cells were fixed for IF staining with dsRNA-specific J2 monoclonal Ab, and cell lysates were harvested for WB of viral nucleocapsid (N) protein. Supernatants (SN) and cytoplasmic lysates were obtained to measure ACE2 levels by ELISA.\n\nResultsIn both human cohorts, ACE2 protein and mRNA levels were decreased in peripheral airways from COPD patients versus both smoker and NS controls, but similar in central airways. TMPRSS2 levels were similar across groups. Mice exposed to CS had decreased ACE2 protein levels in their bronchial and alveolar epithelia versus air-exposed mice exposed to 3 and 6 months of CS. In Calu3 cells in vitro, CS-treatment abrogated infection to levels below the limit of detection. Similar results were seen with WB for viral N protein, showing peak viral protein synthesis at 72hr.\n\nConclusionsACE2 levels were decreased in both bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells from uninfected COPD patients versus controls, and from CS-exposed versus air-exposed mice. CS-pre-treatment did not affect ACE2 levels but potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in this in vitro model. These findings urge to further investigate the controversial effects of CS and COPD on SARS-CoV2 infection.",

This interaction is critical for virus entry and virus-host membrane fusion. Soluble ACE2 ectodomains bind and neutralize the virus but the short in vivo half-lives of soluble ACE2 limits its therapeutic use. Fusion of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) part of human immunoglobulin G (IgG) to the ACE2 ectodomain can prolong the in vivo half-life but bears the risk of unwanted Fc-receptor activation and antibody-dependent disease enhancement. Here, we describe optimized ACE2-Fc fusion constructs that avoid Fc-receptor binding by using IgG4-Fc as a fusion partner. The engineered ACE2-IgG4-Fc fusion proteins described herein exhibit promising pharmaceutical properties and a broad antiviral activity at single-digit nanomolar concentration.

    "abstract": "Viral zoonoses are a serious threat to public health and global security, as reflected by the current scenario of the growing number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) cases. However, as pathogenic viruses are highly diverse, identification of their host ranges remains a major challenge. Here, we present a combined computational and experimental framework, called REceptor ortholog-based POtential virus hoST prediction (REPOST), for the prediction of potential virus hosts. REPOST first selects orthologs from a diverse species by identity and phylogenetic analyses. Secondly, these orthologs is classified preliminarily as permissive or non-permissive type by infection experiments. Then, key residues are identified by comparing permissive and non-permissive orthologs. Finally, potential virus hosts are predicted by a key residue-specific weighted module. We performed REPOST on SARS-CoV-2 by studying angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 orthologs from 287 vertebrate animals. REPOST efficiently narrowed the range of potential virus host species (with 95.74% accuracy).",

    "abstract": "Innate immune signaling pathways comprise multiple proteins that promote inflammation. This multistep means of information transfer suggests that complexity is a prerequisite for pathway design. Herein, we examined this possibility by studying caspases that regulate inflammasome-dependent inflammation. Several caspases differ in their ability to recognize bacterial LPS and cleave interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}). No caspase is known to contain both activities, yet distinct caspases with complementary activities bookend an LPS-induced pathway to IL-1{beta} cleavage. Using unique caspases present in carnivorans as a guide, we identified molecular determinants of IL-1{beta} cleavage specificity within caspase-1. This knowledge enabled the redesign of human caspase-4 to operate as a one-protein signaling pathway, which intrinsically links LPS detection to IL-1{beta} cleavage and release, independent of inflammasomes. Strikingly, cat caspase-4 displays the activities of redesigned human caspase-4. These findings illustrate natural signaling pathway diversity and highlight how multistep innate immune pathways can be condensed into a single protein.",

    "abstract": "The serine incorporator (SERINC) protein family has five paralogous members with 9-11 transmembrane domains. SERINC5 is a potent host restriction factor and antagonized by HIV-1 Nef and two other retroviral accessory proteins via the lysosomal degradation pathway. Here, we investigated human SERINC4 expression and antiviral mechanisms. Unlike its four paralogs, human SERINC4 is subjected to proteasome-mediated turnover, resulting in ~250-fold lower expression than SERINC5. However, when expression was normalized, human SERINC4 restricted HIV-1 replication as effectively as SERINC5, and SERINC4 was also antagonized by Nef via the lysosomal pathway. Although SERINC4 proteins are conserved within primates or rodents, their N-terminal regions are highly variable across species. Interestingly, unlike human SERINC4, murine SERINC4 was stably expressed but had a very poor antiviral activity. We created stable SERINC4 chimeras by replacing the N-terminal region and found that the 1-34 and 35-92 amino acids determine SERINC4 antiviral activity or protein expression, respectively. Using these chimeras, we demonstrate that SERINC4 is incorporated into HIV-1 virions and restricts Tier 1 HIV-1 more effectively than Tier 3 HIV-1. Importantly, SERINC4 increases HIV-1 sensitivity to broadly neutralizing antibodies. Thus, human SERINC4 strongly restricts HIV-1 replication when it is overexpressed, which reflects a potential antiviral activity of this gene product under physiological conditions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIdentification of another potent anti-HIV-1 host factor SERINC4 from the SERINC family\nC_LIO_LIIdentification of two N-terminal domains that regulate SERINC4 expression and antiviral activity\nC_LIO_LIUnderstanding the natural degradation of human SERINC4 by the proteasomal pathway\nC_LIO_LIUnderstanding the important role of the lysosomal pathway in Nef antagonism of host restriction\nC_LI\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Even though beneficial plant-microbe interactions are commonly observed in nature, direct evidence for the evolution of bacterial mutualism in the rhizosphere remains elusive. Here we use experimental evolution to causally show that initially plant-antagonistic Pseudomonas protegens bacterium evolves into mutualists in the rhizosphere of Arabidopsis thaliana within six plant growth cycles (6 months). This evolutionary transition was accompanied with increased mutualist fitness via two mechanisms: i) improved competitiveness for root exudates and ii) enhanced capacity for activating the root-specific transcription factor gene MYB72, which triggers the production of plant-secreted scopoletin antimicrobial for which the mutualists evolved relatively higher tolerance to. Genetically, mutualism was predominantly associated with different mutations in the GacS/GacA two-component regulator system, which conferred high fitness benefits only in the presence of plants. Together, our results show that bacteria can rapidly evolve along the parasitism-mutualism continuum in the plant rhizosphere at an agriculturally relevant evolutionary timescale.",

    "abstract": "DOT1L, the only H3K79 methyltransferase in human cells and a homolog of the yeast Dot1, normally forms a complex with AF10, AF17 and ENL/AF9, is dysregulated in most of the cases of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) and is believed to regulate transcriptional elongation without much evidence. Here we show that the depletion of DOT1L reduced the global occupancy without affecting the traveling ratio or the elongation rate of Pol II, suggesting it not a major elongation factor. An examination of general transcription factors (GTFs) binding revealed globally reduced TBP and TFIIA occupancies near promoters after DOT1L loss, pointing to a role in transcriptional initiation. Proteomic studies uncovered that DOT1L regulates transcriptional initiation likely by facilitating the recruitment of TFIID. Moreover, ENL, a DOT1L complex subunit with a known role in DOT1L recruitment, also regulates transcriptional initiation. Furthermore, DOT1L stimulates H2B monoubiquitination by limiting the recruitment of human SAGA complex, and the connection between Dot1/DOT1L and SAGA complex is conserved between yeast and human. These results advanced current understanding of roles of DOT1L complex in transcriptional regulation and MLL.",

    "abstract": "Development relies on a series of precisely orchestrated cell fate changes. While studies of fate transitions often focus on changes in gene regulatory networks, most transitions are also associated with changes in cell shape and cell behaviour. Here, we investigate changes in migratory behaviour in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells during their first developmental fate transition, exit from ES cell state. We show that naive pluripotent ES cells cannot efficiently migrate on 2-dimensional substrates but are able to migrate in an amoeboid fashion when placed in confinement. Exit from ES cell state, typically characterised by enhanced cell spreading, is associated with decreased migration in confinement and acquisition of mesenchymal-like migration on 2D substrates. Interestingly, confined, amoeboid-like migration of ES cells strongly depends on Myosin IIA, but not Myosin IIB. In contrast mesenchymal-like migration of cells exiting the ES cell state does not depend on Myosin motor activity but relies on the activity of the Arp2/3 complex. Together, our data suggest that during early differentiation, cells undergo a switch in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, leading to a transition from amoeboid-to mesenchymal-like migration.\n\nSummary statementNaive mouse embryonic stem cells display amoeboid-like migration in confinement, but switch to mesenchymal-like migration as they exit the ES cell state.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveEndothelial cells that form the innermost layer of all vessels exhibit heterogeneous cell behaviors and responses to pro-angiogenic signals that are critical for vascular sprouting and angiogenesis. Once vessels form, remodeling and blood flow lead to endothelial cell quiescence, and homogeneity in cell behaviors and signaling responses. These changes are important for the function of mature vessels, but whether and at what level endothelial cells regulate overall expression heterogeneity during this transition is poorly understood. Here we profiled endothelial cell transcriptomic heterogeneity, and expression heterogeneity of selected proteins, under homeostatic laminar flow.\n\nApproach and ResultsSingle-cell RNA sequencing and fluorescence microscopy were used to characterize heterogeneity in RNA and protein gene expression levels of human endothelial cells under homeostatic laminar flow compared to non-flow conditions. Analysis of transcriptome variance, Gini coefficient, and coefficient of variation showed that more genes increased RNA heterogeneity under laminar flow relative to genes whose expression became more homogeneous. Analysis of a subset of genes for relative protein expression revealed that most protein profiles showed decreased heterogeneity under flow. In contrast, the magnitude of expression level changes in RNA and protein was coordinated among endothelial cells in flow vs. non-flow conditions.\n\nConclusionsEndothelial cells exposed to homeostatic laminar flow showed increased cohort heterogeneity in RNA expression levels, while cohort expression heterogeneity of selected cognate proteins decreased under laminar flow. These findings suggest that EC homeostasis is imposed at the level of protein translation and/or stability rather than transcriptionally.",

However, the mechanism(s) by which this occurs remain(s) unclear. Using biochemical and mass spectrometry analyses we found that TRARG1 is dephosphorylated in response to insulin in a PI3K/Akt-dependent manner and is a novel substrate for GSK3. Priming phosphorylation of murine TRARG1 at serine 84 allows for GSK3-directed phosphorylation at serines 72, 76 and 80. A similar pattern of phosphorylation was observed in human TRARG1, suggesting that our findings are translatable to human TRARG1. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 increased cell surface GLUT4 in cells stimulated with a submaximal insulin dose, and this was impaired following Trarg1 knockdown, suggesting that TRARG1 acts as a GSK3-mediated regulator in GLUT4 trafficking. These data place TRARG1 within the insulin signaling network and provide insights into how GSK3 regulates GLUT4 trafficking in adipocytes.",

However, due to its coarse image resolution, PET is unable to resolve the metabolic role of cancer-associated stroma, which often influences the metabolic reprogramming of a tumor. This study investigates the feasibility of imaging engineered 3D tumor models with high resolution using FDG.\n\nMETHODMulticellular tumor spheroids (A549 lung adenocarcinoma) were co-cultured with GFP-expressing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) within an artificial extracellular matrix to mimic a tumor and its surrounding stroma. The tumor model was constructed as a thin 3D layer over a transparent CdWO4 scintillator plate to allow high-resolution imaging of the cultured cells. The radioluminescence signal was collected by a highly sensitive microscope and camera. Fluorescence microscopy was performed in the same instrument to localize endothelial and tumor cells.\n\nRESULTSSimultaneous brightfield and fluorescence imaging, co-localized with radioluminescence signal, provided high-resolution information on FDG accumulation in the engineered tissue. The microvascular stromal compartment took up a large fraction of FDG, comparable to the tumor spheroids. In vitro gamma counting also revealed that both A549 and HUVEC cells were highly glycolytic and characterized by rapid FDG-uptake kinetics.\n\nCONCLUSIONOur study demonstrates the feasibility of imaging FDG distribution in tumor and stromal components separately with high spatial resolution in engineered in vitro tumor models. Our imaging method is safe, simple, rapid, and can be easily used for other in vitro cancer models, surgical tissue slices, and tumor biopsies to interrogate PET radiotracer uptake at high resolution.",

    "abstract": "Linker histones (LH) bind to nucleosomes with their globular domain (gH) positioned in either an on- or an off-dyad binding mode. Here, we study the effect of the linker DNA (L-DNA) sequence on the binding of a full-length LH, Xenopus laevis H1.0b, to a Widom 601 nucleosome core particle (NCP) flanked by two 40 bp long L-DNA arms, by single-pair FRET spectroscopy. We varied the sequence of the 11 bp of L-DNA adjoining the NCP on either side, making the sequence either A-tract, purely GC, or mixed, with 64% AT. The labelled gH consistently exhibited higher FRET efficiency with the labelled L-DNA containing the A-tract, than that with the pure-GC stretch, even when the stretches were swapped. However, it did not exhibit higher FRET efficiency with the L-DNA containing 64% AT-rich mixed DNA when compared to the pure-GC stretch. We explain our observations with a model that shows that the gH binds on-dyad and that two arginines mediate recognition of the A-tract via its characteristically narrow minor groove. To investigate whether this on-dyad minor groove-based recognition was distinct from previously identified off-dyad major groove-based recognition, a nucleosome was designed with A-tracts on both the L-DNA arms. One A-tract was complementary to thymine and the other to deoxyuridine. The major groove of the thymine-tract was lined with methyl groups that were absent from the major groove of the deoxyuridine tract. The gH exhibited similar FRET for both these A-tracts, suggesting that it does not interact with the thymine methyl groups exposed on the major groove. Our observations thus complement previous studies that suggest that different LH isoforms may employ different ways of recognizingff AT-rich DNA and A-tracts. This adaptability may enable the LH to universally compact scaffold-associated regions and constitutive heterochromatin, which are rich in such sequences.\n\nStatement of SignificanceLinker histones (LHs) associate with the smallest repeat unit of chromatin, the nucleosome. They have been observed to have affinity for AT-rich DNA, which is found in constitutive heterochromatin and scaffold-associated regions (SAR), which could explain how the LHs can compact such parts of the chromatin. How the LH recognizes such sequences is poorly understood. Using single-pair FRET and modelling, we provide experimental evidence of DNA-sequence-induced changes in the orientation of a LH bound to a nucleosome, and thereby reveal a new mechanism by which the LH can recognize A-tract sequences that are abundantly present in the SAR. Our results show that, depending on how the LH associates with the nucleosome, it can employ more than one mechanism to recognize AT-rich DNA.",

    "abstract": "Ambient temperature has a profound influence on cellular electrophysiology through direct control over the gating mechanisms of different ion channels. In the heart, low temperature is known to favour prolongation of the action potential. However, not much is known about the influence of temperature on other important characterisation parameters such as the resting membrane potential (RMP), excitability, morphology and characteristics of the action potential (AP), restitution properties, conduction velocity (CV) of signal propagation, etc. Here we present the first, detailed, systematic in silico study of the electrophysiological characterization of cardiomyocytes from different regions of the normal human atria, based on the effects of ambient temperature (5 -50{degrees}C). We observe that RMP decreases with increasing temperature. At [~] 48{degrees}C, the cells lose their excitability. Our studies show that different parts of the atria react differently to the same changes in temperature. In tissue simulations a drop in temperature correlated positively with a decrease in CV, but the decrease was region-dependent, as expected. In this article we show how this heterogeneous response can provide an explanation for the development of a proarrhythmic substrate during mild hypothermia. We use the above concept to propose a treatment strategy for atrial fibrillation that involves severe hypothermia in specific regions of the heart for a duration of only [~] 200ms.",

    "abstract": "Cold temperatures are a threat to temperate plants, and Arabidopsis thaliana has acquired an adaptive gene expression network controlled by CBF transcription factors. The CBFs are sufficient to enable plants to survive otherwise lethal subzero temperatures. Constitutive CBF expression causes delayed flowering and stunted growth, and plants have evolved the ability to restrict CBF expression to occur only in the cold. This allows plants to anticipate likely freezing events and selectively deploy cold tolerance. The mechanism by which cold stress is sensed is however unknown. Here we show that protein translation rates in plants are proportional to temperature, and reduced translation rates trigger a rise in intracellular free calcium that activates the CAMTA transcription factors, and these directly activate cold-induced gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are divided into multiple branches leading to divergent synaptic targets. This poses a remarkable challenge for regenerating axons as they select their original trajectory at nerve branch-points. Despite implications for functional regeneration, the molecular mechanisms underlying target selectivity are not well characterized. Zebrafish motor nerves are composed of a ventral and a dorsal branch that diverge at a choice point, and we have previously shown that regenerating axons faithfully select their original branch and targets. Here we identify Robo2 as a key regulator of target selective regeneration. We demonstrate that Robo2 function in regenerating axons is required and sufficient to drive target selective regeneration, and that Robo2 acts in response to glia located precisely where regenerating axons select the branch-specific trajectory to prevent and correct axonal errors. Combined our results reveal a glia derived mechanism that acts locally via axonal Robo2 to promote target selective regeneration.",

PMSF also inhibited generation of antibacterial activity released from in vitro S. Typhi - infected peritoneal macrophages in a cell death - dependent manner. Intracellularly, infection with S.

The Carnivora, like mink, carry many zoonoses yet how diversity in host immune genes across species impact upon pathogen carriage are poorly understood. Here we describe a progressive evolutionary downregulation of pathogen sensing inflammasome pathways in Carnivora. This includes the loss of nucleotide-oligomerisation domain leucine rich repeat receptors (NLRs), acquisition of a unique caspase-1/-4 effector fusion protein that processes gasdermin D pore formation without inducing lytic cell death and the formation of an NLRP3-caspase-8 containing inflammasome that inefficiently processes interleukin-1{beta} (IL-1{beta}). Inflammasomes regulate gut immunity, but the carnivorous diet is antimicrobial suggesting a tolerance to the loss of these immune pathways. The consequences of systemic inflammasome downregulation, however, can reduce the host sensing of specific pathogens such that they can reside undetected in the Carnivora.",

We present cryo-EM structures of a Piwi-piRNA complex with and without target RNAs and analysis of target recognition. Resembling Argonaute, Piwi identifies targets using the piRNA seed-region. However, Piwi creates a much weaker seed so that prolonged target association requires further piRNA-target pairing. Beyond the seed, Piwi creates wide central cleft wide for unencumbered piRNA-target pairing, enabling long-lived Piwi-piRNA-target interactions that are tolerant of mismatches. Piwi ensures targeting fidelity by blocking propagation of the piRNA-target duplex in the absence of faithful seed pairing, and by requiring extended piRNA-target pairing to reach an endonucleolytically active conformation. This mechanism allows Piwi to minimize off-targeting cellular mRNAs and adapt piRNA sequences to evolving genomic threats.",

These important ecosystem services were achieved through their highly complex societies and remarkable adaptations, including the evolution of sterile worker castes, the acquisition of endosymbionts, and the capacity for extensive environmental engineering, yet the causes and consequences of their ecological success are still poorly understood. The goals of our study were (1) to provide the first complete, species-level phylogeny of all currently recognized termite species by integrating the available genetic and taxonomic data, as well as methods of phylogenetic imputation and divergence time estimation; and (2) to explore variation in speciation rates among termite lineages. We provide the inferred relationships as a set of 1,000 pseudo-posterior trees, which can be used in future comparative analyses. We demonstrate that speciation rates have been relatively constant throughout the history of termites, with two positive shifts in speciation rates: one at their origin of Euisoptera and the other concordant with evolution of Termitidae. On the other hand, there was no obvious trend towards deceleration in speciation rates for termites as a whole, nor within the most species-rich families. The provided trees might represent a valuable resource for termite comparative studies by summarizing the available phylogenetic information, while accounting for uncertainty in the inferred topologies.",

    "abstract": "In addition to mediating telomerase recruitment, shelterin protein TPP1 also stimulates telomerase processivity. Assessing the in vivo significance of the latter role of TPP1 has been difficult, as TPP1 mutations that perturb telomerase function tend to abolish both telomerase recruitment and processivity. We sought to separate the two activities of TPP1 in regulating telomerase by considering a structure-guided mutagenesis study on the S. cerevisiae telomerase-associated Est3 protein, which revealed a TELR surface region on Est3 that regulates telomerase function via an unknown mechanism without affecting the interaction between Est3 and telomerase (1). Here, we show that mutations within the structurally conserved TELR region on TPP1 impaired telomerase processivity while leaving telomerase recruitment unperturbed, hence uncoupling the two roles of TPP1 in regulating telomerase. Telomeres in cell lines containing homozygous TELR mutations progressively shortened to a critical length that caused cellular senescence, despite the presence of abundant telomerase in these cells. Our findings not only demonstrate that telomerase processivity can be regulated by TPP1, in a process separable from its role in recruiting telomerase to telomeres, but also establish that the in vivo stimulation of telomerase processivity by TPP1 is critical for telomere length homeostasis and long-term cell viability.\n\nSignificanceTelomerase directs the synthesis of new telomeric repeats at chromosome ends, enabling cells to overcome the end replication problem and continue to divide. The shelterin protein TPP1 interacts with telomerase, promoting both telomerase recruitment and processivity (the addition of multiple telomeric repeats after a single substrate binding event). Here we show the identification of separation-of-function mutants of TPP1 that eliminate telomerase processivity but leave the telomerase recruitment function intact. When introduced into human cells in a homozygous manner, these mutations can induce critical telomere shortening and cellular senescence. Our observations therefore provide the first demonstration that telomerase processivity, in addition to telomerase recruitment, is a key regulatory step in vivo for continued human cell proliferation.",

    "abstract": "How ectothermic animals will cope with global warming, especially more frequent and intense heatwaves, is a critical determinant of the ecological impacts of climate change. There has been extensive study of upper thermal tolerance limits among fish species but how intraspecific variation in tolerance may be affected by habitat characteristics and evolutionary history has not been considered. Intraspecific variation is a primary determinant of species vulnerability to climate change, with implications for global patterns of impacts of ongoing warming. Using published critical thermal maximum (CTmax) data on 203 marine and freshwater fish species, we found that intraspecific vsariation in upper thermal tolerance varies according to a species latitude and evolutionary history. Notably, freshwater tropical species have lower variation in tolerance than temperate species in the northern hemisphere, which implies increased vulnerability to impacts of thermal stress. The extent of variation in CTmax among fish species has a strong phylogenetic signal, which may indicate a constraint on evolvability to rising temperatures in tropical fishes. That is, in addition to living closer to their upper thermal limits, tropical species may have higher sensitivity and lower adaptability to global warming compared to temperate counterparts. This is evidence that tropical fish communities, worldwide, are especially vulnerable to ongoing climate change.",

    "abstract": "Learning to be safe is central for adaptive behaviour when threats are no longer present. Detecting the absence of an expected threat is key for threat extinction learning and an essential process for the behavioural treatment of anxiety related disorders. One possible mechanism underlying extinction learning is a dopaminergic mismatch signal that encodes the absence of an expected threat. Here we show that such a dopamine-related pathway underlies extinction learning in humans. Dopaminergic enhancement via administration of L-DOPA (vs. Placebo) was associated with reduced retention of differential psychophysiological threat responses at later test, which was mediated by activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex that was specific to extinction learning. L-DOPA administration enhanced signals at the time-point of an expected, but omitted threat in extinction learning within the nucleus accumbens, which were functionally coupled with the ventral tegmental area and the amygdala. Computational modelling of threat expectancies further revealed prediction error encoding in nucleus accumbens that was reduced when L-DOPA was administered. Our results thereby provide evidence that extinction learning is influenced by L-DOPA and provide a mechanistic perspective to augment extinction learning by dopaminergic enhancement in humans.\n\nSummary COI statementNo conflict of interest for any of the authors.

    "abstract": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and macular dystrophy (MD) are prevalent retinal degenerative diseases associated with gradual photoreceptor death. These diseases are often caused by genetic mutations that result in degeneration of the retina postnatally after it has fully developed. The Prominin-1 gene (Prom1) is a causative gene for RP and MD, and Prom1- knockout (KO) mice recapitulate key features of these diseases including light-dependent retinal degeneration and stenosis of retinal blood vessels. The mechanisms underlying progression of such degeneration have remained unknown, however. We here analysed early events associated with retinal degeneration in Prom1-KO mice. We found that photoreceptor cell death and glial cell activation occur between 2 and 3 weeks after birth. High-throughput analysis revealed that expression of the endothelin-2 gene (Edn2) was markedly up-regulated in the Prom1-deficient retina during this period. Expression of Edn2 was also induced by light stimulation in Prom1-KO mice that had been reared in the dark. Finally, treatment with endothelin receptor antagonists attenuated photoreceptor cell death, gliosis, and retinal vessel stenosis in Prom1-KO mice. Our findings suggest that inhibitors of endothelin signalling may delay the progression of RP and MD and therefore warrant further study as potential therapeutic agents for these diseases.",

These inferences were then confronted to flies fundamental niches estimated through laboratory-measured fitnesses on host plants. Species abundances were mainly determined by host plants followed by climatic factors, with a minor role for competition between species sharing host plants. The relative importance of these factors mildly changed when we focused on particular host plant groups. Despite overlapping fundamental niches, specialists and generalists had almost distinct realized niches, with possible competitive exclusion of generalists by specialists on Cucurbitaceae, and different assembly rules: specialists were mainly influenced by their adaptation to host plants while generalist abundances varied regardless of their fundamental host use.",

    "abstract": "An understanding of how ecological niches can change through time is key to predicting the effect of future global change. Past climatic fluctuations provide a natural experiment to assess the extent to which species can change their niche. Here we use an extensive archaeological database to formally test whether the niche of four European ungulates changed between 40 and 8 kya (i.e. before major anthropogenic habitat modification and excluding the confounding effect of domestication). We find that niche change depended on habitat. Horse and aurochs, which are adapted to open environment, changed their niche after the Last Glacial Maximum, and it is unclear whether this was the result of adaptation, or an expansion of the realized niche as a response to the extinction of other megafauna (competitors and predators) that shared the same habitat preferences. On the other hand, red deer and wild boar, which prefer close and semi-close habitats, did not change their niche during the same period; possibly because these habitats have experienced fewer extinctions. Irrespective of the mechanism that might have led to the observed niche changes, the fact that large mammals with long generation times can change their niche over the time period of thousands of years cautions against assuming a constant niche when predicting the future.\n\nSignificance statementWhen predicting species responses to future change, it is often assumed that their habitat preferences (i.e. their niche) will not change. However, it is strongly debated whether this is reasonable. Here we show that two out of four species of large European ungulates changed their niche following the Last Glacial Maximum, possibly as a response to the reorganization of animal communities that resulted from numerous megafauna extinctions. This finding cautions against the assumption of a constant niche, highlighting that, to predict the future, we will ultimately need to understand the mechanisms that underpin the success of a given species under different climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary malignant brain tumor and is resistant to current therapies. Here, using a combination of proteomic and genetic approaches in both Drosophila and human GBM models, we identify novel signaling effectors that act downstream of EGFR and PI3K signaling pathways, which drive GBM. Our results indicate that RIOK2, an atypical serine/threonine kinase, forms a complex with the RNA-binding protein, IMP3 (Imp in Drosophila), and that the dRIOK2/RIOK-Imp/IMP3 pathway is necessary for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, our results indicate that RIOK2 catalytic activity is important for neoplasia and recruits TORC2 to phosphorylate IMP3. Finally, the dRIOK2-Imp pathway regulates protein levels of dMyc, a known Imp target mRNA, and these key findings were recapitulated in human GBM models. Collectively, our data indicates that RIOK2 catalytic activity promotes the activation of TORC2 and recruitment of IMP3, which in turn, modulates MYC mRNA and protein levels to promote tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Modern Japanese have two major ancestral populations: the indigenous Jomon hunter gatherers and continental East Asian farmers. To figure out the formation process of current Japanese population, we developed a reference-free detection method of variants derived from ancestral populations using a summary statistic, the ancestry-marker index (AMI). We confirmed by computer simulations that AMI can detect ancestry-derived variants even in an admixed population of recently diverged source populations with high accuracy, which cannot be achieved by the most widely used statistics, S*, for identifying archaic ancestry. We applied the AMI to modern Japanese samples and identified 208,648 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were likely derived from the Jomon people (Jomon-derived variants). The analysis of Jomon-derived variants in 10,842 modern Japanese individuals recruited from all over Japan revealed that the admixture proportions of the Jomon people varied between prefectures, probably due to the differences of population sizes of immigrants in the final Jomon to the Yayoi period. The estimated allele frequencies of genome-wide SNPs in the ancestral populations of modern Japanese suggested their phenotypic characteristics possibly for adaptation to their respective livelihoods; higher triglycerides and blood sugar for the Jomon ancestry and higher C-reactive protein and eosinophil counts for continental ancestry. According to our findings, we propose a formation model of modern Japanese population; regional variations in admixture proportions of the Jomon people and continental East Asians formed genotypic and phenotypic gradations of current Japanese archipelago populations.",

    "abstract": "Communication is essential for social animals, but deciding how to utilize information provided by conspecifics is a complex process that depends on environmental and intrinsic factors. Honey bees use a unique form of communication, the waggle dance, to inform nestmates about the location of food sources. However, as in many other animals, experienced individuals often ignore this social information and prefer to rely on prior experiences, i.e. private information. The neurosensory factors that drive the decision to use social information are not yet understood. Here we test whether the decision to use social dance information or private information is linked to gene expression differences in different parts of the nervous system. We trained bees to collect food from sugar water feeders and observed whether they utilize social or private information when exposed to dances for a new food source. We performed transcriptome analysis of four brain parts critical for cognition: the subesophageal ganglion, the central brain, the mushroom bodies, and the antennal lobes but, unexpectedly, detected no differences between social or private information users. In contrast, we found 413 differentially expressed genes in the antennae, suggesting that variation in sensory perception mediate the decision to use social information. Social information users were characterized by the upregulation of dopamine and serotonin genes while private information users upregualted several genes coding for odor perception. These results highlight that decision making in honey bees might also depend on peripheral processes of perception rather than higher-order brain centers of information integration.",

Since the ability to predict disease evolution is crucial for clinical decision, we studied single cell genomics and transcriptomics of CD34-positive cells from a primary myelofibrosis (PMF) patient who progressed to acute myeloid Leukemia (AML) while receiving Ruxolitinib.\n\nSingle cell genomics allowed the reconstruction of clonal hierarchy and demonstrated that TET2 was the first mutated gene while FLT3 was the last one. Disease evolution was accompanied by increased clonal heterogeneity and mutational rate, but clones carrying TP53 and FLT3 mutations were already present in chronic phase.\n\nSingle cell transcriptomics unraveled repression of interferon signaling suggesting an immunosuppressive effect exerted by Ruxolitinib. Moreover, AML transformation was associated with a differentiative block and immune escape.\n\nThese results suggest that single cell analysis can unmask tumor heterogeneity and provide meaningful insights about PMF progression that might guide personalized therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPair bonding with a reproductive partner is rare among mammals but is an important feature of human social behavior. Decades of research on monogamous prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster), along with comparative studies using the related non-bonding meadow vole (M. pennsylvanicus), have revealed many of the neural and molecular mechanisms necessary for pair-bond formation in that species. However, these studies have largely focused on just a few neuromodulatory systems. To test the hypothesis that neural gene expression differences underlie differential capacities to bond, we performed RNA-sequencing on tissue from three brain regions important for bonding and other social behaviors across bond-forming prairie voles and non-bonding meadow voles. We examined gene expression in the amygdala, hypothalamus, and combined ventral pallidum/nucleus accumbens in virgins and at three time points after mating to understand species differences in gene expression at baseline, in response to mating, and during bond formation.\n\nResultsWe first identified species and brain region as the factors most strongly associated with gene expression in our samples. Next, we found gene categories related to cell structure, translation and metabolism that differed in expression across species in virgins, as well as categories associated with cell structure, synaptic and neuroendocrine signaling, and transcription and translation that varied among the focal regions in our study. Additionally, we identified genes that were differentially expressed across species after mating in each of our regions of interest. These include genes involved in regulating transcription, neuron structure, and synaptic plasticity. Finally, we identified modules of co-regulated genes that were strongly correlated with brain region in both species, and modules that were correlated with post-mating time points in prairie voles but not meadow voles.\n\nConclusionsThese results reinforce the importance of pre-mating differences that confer the ability to form pair bonds in prairie voles but not promiscuous species such as meadow voles. Gene ontology analysis supports the hypothesis that pair-bond formation involves transcriptional regulation, and changes in neuronal structure. Together, our results expand knowledge of the genes involved in the pair bonding process and open new avenues of research in the molecular mechanisms of bond formation.",

    "abstract": "Language comprehension requires the recognition of individual words and the combination of their meanings to yield complex concepts or interpretations. Rather than simple concatenation, this combinatory process often requires the insertion of unstated semantic material between words, based on thematic or feature knowledge of the concepts. For example, the phrase horse barn is not interpreted as a blend of a horse and a barn, but specifically a barn in which horses are kept. Mounting evidence suggests two cortical semantic hubs, in left temporoparietal and anterior temporal cortex, underpin thematic and feature concept knowledge, but much remains unclear about how these putative hubs contribute to combinatory language processing. Using magnetoencephalography, we contrasted source-localized responses to modifier-noun phrases involving thematic relations vs. feature modifications, while also examining how lower-level orthographic processing fed into responses supporting word combination. Twenty-eight participants completed three procedures examining responses to letter-strings, adjective-noun phrases, and noun-noun combinations that varied the semantic relations between words. We found that while color + noun phrases engaged the left anterior temporal lobe (150-300 ms after phrasal head), posterior temporal lobe (150-300 ms), and angular gyrus (300-450 ms), only left posterior temporal lobe responses were sensitive to implicit thematic relations between composing nouns (150-300 ms). We additionally identified a left temporo-occipital progression from orthographic to lexical processing, feeding into ventral anterior areas engaged in the combination of word meanings. Finally, by examining source signal leakage, we characterized the degree to which these responses could be distinguished from one another, using linear source estimation.",

    "abstract": "New tools in optogenetics and molecular biology have culminated in recent studies which mark immediate-early gene (IEG)-expressing neurons as memory traces or engrams. Although the activity-dependent expression of IEGs has been successfully utilised to label memory traces, their roles in engram specification is incompletely understood. Outstanding questions remain as to whether expression of IEGs can interplay with network properties such as functional connectivity and also if neurons expressing different IEGs are functionally distinct. We investigated the expression of Arc and c-Fos, two commonly utilised IEGs in memory engram specification, in cultured hippocampal neurons. After pharmacological induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the network, we noted an emergent network property of refinement in functional connectivity between neurons, characterized by a global down-regulation of network connectivity, together with strengthening of specific connections. Subsequently, we show that Arc expression correlates with the effects of network refinement, with Arc-positive neurons being selectively strengthened. Arc positive neurons were also found to be located in closer physical proximity to each other in the network. While the expression pattern of IEGs c-Fos and Arc strongly overlaps, Arc was more selectively expressed than c-Fos. These IEGs also act together in coding information about connection strength pruning. These results demonstrate important links between IEG expression and network connectivity, which serve to bridge the gap between cellular correlates and network effects in learning and memory.",

Here we find that GLI3, specifically, plays a critical role in satellite cell activation. Primary cilia-mediated processing of GLI3 is required to maintain satellite cells in a G0 dormant state. Strikingly, satellite cells lacking GLI3 enter GAlert in the absence of injury. Furthermore, GLI3 depletion or inhibition of its processing stimulates symmetrical division in satellite cells and expansion of the stem cell pool. As a result, satellite cells lacking GLI3 display rapid cell-cycle entry, increased proliferation and augmented self-renewal, and markedly enhanced long-term regenerative capacity. Therefore, our results reveal an essential role for primary cilia processing of GLI3 in regulating muscle stem cell activation and fate.",

We evaluated the rates of gesture and speech-like vocalizations (protophones) of 10 infants at 4, 7, and 11 months of age using parent-infant laboratory recordings. We found that infant protophones outnumbered gestures substantially at all three ages, ranging from >30 times more protophones than gestures at 3 months, to more than twice as many protophones as gestures at 11 months. The results suggest that vocalization is the predominant mode of communication in human infants from the beginning of life.",

Resistance to the pathogen is therefore, an important factor to be considered when breeding for high yielding and earliness in fruiting. Resistance to the pathogen using Leaf Disc Test (LDT) was conducted at the Plant Pathology Laboratory, Ibadan, on detached 15mm diameter discs of two-month-old leaves obtained from nineteen newly generated cacao hybrids in the gene pool of the Institute. Attached Whole Leaf Test (AWLT) was also conducted on few selected hybrids in the screen house at the same institute. Ten l zoospores suspension of P. megakarya pathogen adjusted to inoculum strength of 3x105 zoospores/ml using haemocytometer was used for the inoculation of the cacao LD. Using 0-5 disease rating scale, data was taken on the 5th and 7th day after inoculation for LDT and on the 6th day after inoculation for AWLT. Data obtained were subjected to Analysis of Variance and significant means were separated using Student Newman Kuels Test at p<0.05. The LDT classified the hybrids into five groups namely: Resistant (hybrid 001, 003 and 005); Moderately Resistant (hybrid 006, 007, 008,013,015,018 and 019) Moderately Susceptible (hybrid 004, 014 and 017); Susceptible (hybrid 002, 010, 011 and 016) and Highly Susceptible (hybrid 009 and 012). Scores from LDT significantly correlated (r= 0.92**) with that of AWLT. It was observed from the study that cacao hybrid 001, 003 and 005 showed traits of resistant and therefore, could be incorporated into the national breeding programs for the development of high-yielding and resistant cacao cultivars. The moderately resistant hybrids could be conserved for future germplasm enhancement program.",

    "abstract": "Grain size and weight are important yield components in rice (Oryza sativa L.). There is still uncertainty about the genetic control of these traits under drought stress, the most pressing emerging issue in many rice cultivation areas. To address this lack of knowledge, we investigated the genetic architecture of seed size, shape, and weight using the rice Global Multi-parent Advanced Generation Intercross (MAGIC) population, grown under well-watered and vegetative drought conditions. We measured variation in seed size and shape with a new high-throughput phenotyping method based on a desktop scanner and the open-source package Plant Computer Vision (PlantCV). Besides being affordable, rapid, and accurate, our method captured the phenotypic divergence between drought and well-watered samples, expressed as 12 different traits that include traditional size metrics and new grain shape measures. Overall, under water deficit, the MAGIC lines produced smaller and shorter seeds. We identified ten MAGIC lines with traits that make them good candidates for the release of rice cultivars with high yield potential under vegetative drought stress. We ran a marker-trait association analysis for the measured seed-related traits. Most of the identified marker-trait associations showed strong genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE), with most allele effects being conditionally neutral. These results suggest dynamic genetic control of seed size, shape, and weight under vegetative drought stress in rice, highlighting the importance of understanding the contribution of GxE interactions on trait variation to develop resilient and high-yielding rice varieties. Our study confirms that combining low-cost and high-throughput phenotyping strategies with a diverse genetic material suited for multi-environmental trial provides solutions for adapting rice cultivation to current and future environmental adversities.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is correlated with brain atrophy, neuronal loss, neurotransmitter imbalance, and cognitive decline, which also occur in normal aging. Thus, comparing the differences between normal aging and AD is of interest in order to test the accelerated aging hypothesis of AD. An imbalance between excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) neurotransmission, especially in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibition dysfunction, is involved in both AD and normal aging. In the present study, we performed correlation analyses between electroencephalograms (EEGs) and memory in middle-aged ([~]12 months old) wild-type mice (WT) and AD model mice (APP/PS1) after E/I balance adjustment via GABAA agonist muscimol and antagonist bicuculline administration (0.1 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Specifically, EEGs of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex were recorded during Y-maze performance. Overall, WT and AD mice showed different correlation patterns between EEG activity and behavioral memory performance. Significant correlations were observed in EEG activity across a wider range of frequency bands (2-100 Hz, except 4-8 Hz) in WT mice, but were mainly observed in low frequency bands (delta-theta, 2-8 Hz) in AD mice. In addition, muscimol and bicuculline treatment contributed to better brain function in AD mice; in contrast, bicuculline administration resulted in poorer brain function in WT mice. Thus, our study suggests that AD shows a distinct pattern of disrupted brain function, rather than accelerated aging. Importantly, this work reveals new insights into future AD treatment by influencing low-frequency EEG activity through E/I balance adjustment, thereby aiding cognitive recovery.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal oscillations putatively track speech in order to optimize sensory processing. However, it is unclear how isochronous brain oscillations can track pseudo-rhythmic speech input. Here we propose that oscillations can track pseudo-rhythmic speech when considering that speech time is dependent on predictions flowing from internal language models. We show that the temporal dynamics of speech are dependent on the predictability of words in a sentence. A computational model including oscillations, feedback, and inhibition is able to track the natural pseudo-rhythmic speech input. As the model processes, it generates temporal phase codes, which are a candidate mechanism for carrying information forward in time. The model is optimally sensitive to the natural temporal speech dynamics and can explain empirical data on temporal speech illusions. Our results reveal that speech tracking does not only rely on the input acoustics but instead entails an interaction between oscillations and constraints flowing from internal language models.",

    "abstract": "Fluorogenic aptamers are an alternative to established methodology for real-time imaging of RNA transport and dynamics. We developed Broccoli-aptamer concatemers ranging from 4 to 128 substrate-binding site repeats and characterized their behavior fused to an mCherry-coding mRNA in transient transfection, stable expression, and in recombinant cytomegalovirus infection. Concatemerization of substrate-binding sites increased Broccoli fluorescence up to a concatemer length of 16 copies, upon which fluorescence did not increase and mCherry signals declined. This was due to the combined effects of RNA aptamer aggregation, a nuclear export defect and reduced RNA stability. Unfortunately, both cellular and cytomegalovirus genomes were unable to maintain and express high Broccoli concatemer copy numbers, possibly due to recombination events. Overexpression of Broccoli-tagged mRNA led to the formation of p-bodies. However, Broccoli RNAs did not localize to these sites. Interestingly, negative effects of Broccoli concatemers could be partially rescued by introducing linker sequences in between Broccoli repeats warranting further studies. Finally, we show that even though substrate-bound Broccoli is easily photobleached, it can still be utilized in live-cell imaging by adapting a time-lapse imaging protocol.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionInternational students are steadily increasing in South Korean higher education institutions. How well international students in South Korea are adjusted academically and the relationship between acculturation stressors and academic adjustment has not yet been determined. The study aimed to fill this research gap by examining the relationship between acculturation stressors and academic adjustment among Nepalese international students in South Korean higher education institutions.\n\nMethodsThe sample of the study consisted of Nepalese international students who enrolled in 36 universities in South Korea. Students background characteristics and acculturation stressors (e.g., discrimination, homesickness, hate/rejection, fear, cultural shock, and guilt) were selected to assess the association of these characteristics and stressors with academic adjustment. Pearson correlation and hierarchical multiple regression were utilized to examine the association between acculturation stressors and academic adjustment.\n\nResultsThe results from the Pearson correlation revealed the negative correlation of perceived discrimination (r = -.23, p< 0.01), perceived hate/rejection (r = -.18, p< 0.05), perceived fear (r = -.24, p< 0.01), and perceived cultural shock (r = -.17, p< 0.05) with academic adjustment. Further, the hierarchical regression model revealed that marital status ({beta} = .223, p <.01) had a positive association with academic adjustment, whereas perceived fear ({beta} = -.206, p <.05) had a negative association with academic adjustment even after including students background characteristics and other acculturation stressors.\n\nConclusionAddressing acculturation stressors among international students in higher education institutions is essential to facilitate positive academic adjustment. Mainly, perceived fear has negatively affected students academic adjustment. Based on these findings, tailored programs must be developed to curtail students perceived fear in order to enhance their academic performance in South Korean higher education institutions.",

    "abstract": "During last years \"irreproducibility\" became a general problem in omics data analysis due to the use of sophisticated and poorly described computational procedures. For avoiding misleading results, it is necessary to inspect and reproduce the entire data analysis as a unified product. Reproducible Research (RR) provides general guidelines for public access to the analytic data and related analysis code combined with natural language documentation, allowing third-parties to reproduce the findings. We developed easyreporting, a novel R/Bioconductor package, to facilitate the implementation of an RR layer inside reports/tools without requiring any knowledge of the R Markdown language. We describe the main functionalities and illustrate how to create an analysis report using a typical case study concerning the analysis of RNA-seq data. Then, we also show how to trace R functions automatically. Thanks to this latter feature, easyreporting results beneficial for developers to implement procedures that automatically keep track of the analysis steps within Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs). Easyreporting can be useful in supporting the reproducibility of any data analysis project and the implementation of GUIs. It turns out to be very helpful in bioinformatics, where the complexity of the analyses makes it extremely difficult to trace all the steps and parameters used in the study.",
