    "abstract": "During retinal development, multipotent and restricted progenitor cells generate all of the neuronal cells of the retina. Among these are horizontal cells, which are interneurons that modulate the light-induced signal from photoreceptors. This study utilizes the identification of novel cis-regulatory elements as a method to examine the gene regulatory networks that direct the development of horizontal cells. Here we describe a screen for cis-regulatory elements, or enhancers, for the horizontal cell-associated genes PTF1A, ONECUT1 (OC1), TFAP2A (AP2A), and LHX1. The OC1ECR22 and Tfap2aACR5 elements were shown to be potential enhancers for OC1 and TFAP2A, respectively, and to be specifically active in developing horizontal cells. The OC1ECR22 element is activated by PTF1A and RBPJ, which translates to regulation of OC1 expression and suggests that PTF1A is a direct activator of OC1 expression in developing horizontal cells. The region within the Tfap2aACR5 element that is responsible for its activation was determined to be a 100 bp sequence named Motif 4. Both OC1ECR22 and Tfap2aACR5 are negatively regulated by the nuclear receptors THRB and RXRG, as is the expression of OC1 and AP2A, suggesting that nuclear receptors may have a role in the negative regulation of horizontal cell development.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are more common in women than men, and this difference arises during puberty. Increased secretion of gonadal hormones during puberty influences brain structure and function, but the extent to which hormones modulate anxiety-related brain circuits is unclear. The slow developing California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) is an ideal species for studying the effects of hormones on brain function during adolescence. In adults social defeat stress reduces social approach and increases vigilance in females but not males. Here we show this sex difference is absent in juvenile mice, and that prepubertal castration sensitizes adult males to social defeat. Since adult castration has no effect on stress sensitivity, our data show that gonadal hormones act during puberty to program behavioral responses to stress later in life. In adults, calcium imaging in the medioventral bed nucleus of the stria terminalis shows that threatening social contexts increase calcium transients. Furthermore, prepubertal castration generalizes these responses to less threatening social contexts. Prepubertal treatment with the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone acts in males and females to reduce sensitivity to social defeat in adults. Together, these data indicate activation of androgen receptors during puberty are critical for programing behavioral responses to stress in adulthood, highlighting a possible mechanism contributing to sex differences in anxiety.\n\nSignificance StatementPuberty is a key period when sex differences in anxiety emerges. Gonadal hormone release increases during this time but it is largely unknown how they impact brain circuits and behavior. We show that androgens play a key role in programming behavioral responses to social defeat stress. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis responds to social threats and these responses are more generalized in males without gonadal hormone exposure during puberty. Our findings highlight the importance of pubertal androgens in determining adult behavioral responses to social stress.",

    "abstract": "High levels of biodiversity may be needed to maintain ecosystem functioning. By creating niches for other species, ecosystem engineers have the potential to promote biodiversity, but it is unclear how this translates across spatiotemporal scales. We evaluated the long-term impact of ecosystem engineering by beavers (Castor canadensis) on the diversity of mobile species. We tested the hypothesis that the spatial distribution of engineered habitats in different states resulting from ecosystem engineering by beavers increases the biodiversity of large mammals across spatial scales. We tested a second hypothesis that engineered habitat in different states resulting from ecosystem engineering by beavers drive the diversity of large mammals. We compared the richness and composition of boreal mammals using camera traps between habitats with and without history of occurrence by beavers within a protected area, where trapping, hunting, and forest exploitation are prohibited. We found that unique species were mostly found in specific engineered habitats, with ponds and wet meadows showing more species than dry meadows. In addition to the increased diversity of dispersal-limited species, our results show that beavers promote the diversity of mobile species at both local and landscape scales, signaling the importance of niche creation in structuring animal communities across scales.",

    "abstract": "Embryogenesis of flowering plants is initiated by polarization of the zygote, a prerequisite for correct axis formation in the embryo. Zygote polarity and the decision between embryonic and non-embryonic development in the daughter cells is controlled by a MITOGEN-ACTIVATING PROTEIN (MAP) kinase signaling pathway including the MAPKK kinase YODA (YDA). Upstream of YDA act two members of the BRASINOSTEROID SIGNALING KINASE (BSK) family, BSK1 and BSK2. These membrane-associated proteins serve as signaling relay linking receptor kinase complexes with intracellular signaling cascades. The receptor kinases acting upstream of BSK1 and BSK2 in the zygote, however, have so far not been identified. Instead, YDA can in part be activated by the non-canonical BSK family member SHORT SUSPENSOR (SSP) that is contributed by the sperm cell during fertilization. Here, we show that the receptor kinase ERECTA plays a crucial role in zygote polarization as maternally contributed part of the embryonic YDA pathway. SSP on the other hand provides an independent, paternal input to YDA activation, outlining a Y-shaped pathway. We conclude that two independent parental contributions initiate zygote polarization and control suspensor formation and embryonic development.",

Reportedly, Sca-1 regulates the myogenic property of myoblasts and Sca-1-/- mice exhibited defective muscle regeneration. Although the role of Sca-1 in muscle development and maintenance is well-acknowledged, molecular composition of muscle derived Sca-1+ cells is not characterized. Here, we applied a high-resolution mass spectrometry-based workflow to characterize the proteomic landscape of mouse hindlimb skeletal muscle derived Sca-1+ cells. Furthermore, we characterized the impact of the cellular microenvironments on the proteomes of Sca-1+ cells. The proteome component of freshly isolated (ex vivo) Sca-1+ cells was compared with that of Sca-1+ cells expanded in cell culture (in vitro). The analysis revealed significant differences in the protein abundances in the two conditions reflective of their functional variations. The identified proteins were enriched in various biological pathways. Notably, we identified proteins related to myotube differentiation, myotube cell development and myoblast fusion. We also identified a panel of cell surface marker proteins that can be leveraged in future to enrich Sca-1+ cells using combinatorial strategies. Comparative analysis implicated the activation of various pathways leading to increased protein synthesis under in vitro condition. We report here the most comprehensive proteome map of Sca-1+ cells that provides insights into the molecular networks operative in Sca-1+ cells. Importantly, through our work we generated the proteomic blueprint of protein abundances significantly altered in Sca-1+ cells under ex vivo and in vitro conditions.",

    "abstract": "Adjusting to a dynamic environment involves fast changes in the bodys internal state, characterized by coordinated alterations in brain activity, physiological and motor responses. Threat-induced defensive states are a classic example of coordinated adjustment of bodily responses, being cardiac regulation one of the best characterized in vertebrates. A great deal is known regarding the neural basis of invertebrate defensive behaviours, mainly in Drosophila melanogaster. However, whether physiological changes accompany these remains unknown. Here, we set out to describe the internal bodily state of fruit flies upon an inescapable threat and found cardiac acceleration during running and deceleration during freezing. In addition, we found that freezing leads to increased cardiac pumping from the abdomen towards the head-thorax, suggesting mobilization of energy resources. Concordantly, threat-triggered freezing reduces sugar levels in the hemolymph and renders flies less resistant to starvation. The cardiac responses observed during freezing were absent during spontaneous immobility, underscoring the active nature of freezing response. Finally, we show that baseline cardiac activity predicts the amount of freezing upon threat. This work reveals a remarkable similarity with the cardiac responses of vertebrates, suggesting an evolutionarily convergent defensive state in flies. Our findings are at odds with the widespread view that cardiac deceleration while freezing has first evolved in vertebrates and that it is energy sparing. Investigating the physiological changes coupled to defensive behaviours in the fruit fly has revealed that freezing is costly, yet accompanied by cardiac deceleration, and points to heart activity as a key modulator of defensive behaviours.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive adjustment of behavior in pursuit of desired goals is critical for survival. To accomplish this complex feat, individuals must weigh the potential benefits of a given course of action against time, energy, and resource costs. Prior research in this domain has greatly advanced understanding of the cortico-striatal circuits that support the anticipation and receipt of desired outcomes, characterizing core aspects of subjective valuation at discrete points in time. However, motivated goal pursuit is not a static or cost neutral process and the brain mechanisms that underlie individual differences in the dynamic updating of effort expenditure across time remain unclear. Here, 38 healthy right-handed participants underwent functional MRI (fMRI) while completing a novel paradigm to examine their willingness to exert physical effort over a prolonged trial, either to obtain monetary rewards or avoid punishments. During sustained goal pursuit, medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) response scaled with trial-to-trial differences in effort expenditure as a function of both monetary condition and eventual task earnings. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) searchlights were used to examine relations linking prior trial-level effort expenditure to subsequent brain responses to feedback. At reward feedback, whole-brain searchlights identified signals reflecting past effort expenditure in dorsal and ventral mPFC, encompassing broad swaths of frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks. These results suggest a core role for mPFC in scaling effort expenditure during sustained goal pursuit, with the subsequent tracking of effort costs following successful goal attainment extending to incorporate distributed brain networks that support executive functioning and externally oriented attention.\n\nSignificance StatementHistorically, much of the research on subjective valuation has focused on discrete points in time. Here, we examine brain responses associated with willingness to exert physical effort during the sustained pursuit of desired goals. Our analyses reveal a distributed pattern of brain activity encompassing aspects of ventral mPFC that tracks with trial-level variability in effort expenditure. Indicating that the brain represents echoes of effort at the point of feedback, searchlight analyses revealed signals associated with past effort expenditure in broad swaths of dorsal and medial PFC. These data have important implications for the study of how the brains valuation mechanisms contend with the complexity of real-world dynamic environments with relevance for the study of behavior across health and disease.",

It has been suggested that the brain uses prediction to guide the interpretation of incoming input. However, the role of prediction in language processing remains disputed, with disagreement about both the ubiquity and representational nature of predictions. Here, we address both issues by analysing brain recordings of participants listening to audiobooks, and using a deep neural network (GPT-2) to precisely quantify contextual predictions. First, we establish that brain responses to words are modulated by ubiquitous, probabilistic predictions. Next, we disentangle model-based predictions into distinct dimensions, revealing dissociable signatures of syntactic, phonemic and semantic predictions. Finally, we show that high-level (word) predictions inform low-level (phoneme) predictions, supporting hierarchical predictive processing. Together, these results underscore the ubiquity of prediction in language processing, showing that the brain spontaneously predicts upcoming language at multiple levels of abstraction.",

    "abstract": "Networks in neuroscience determine how brain function unfolds, and their perturbations lead to psychiatric disorders and brain disease. Brain networks are characterized by their connectomes, which comprise the totality of all connections, and are commonly described by graph theory. This approach is deeply rooted in a particle view of information processing, based on the quantification of informational bits such as firing rates. Oscillations and brain rhythms demand, however, a wave perspective of information processing based on synchronization. We extend traditional graph theory to a dual particle-wave-perspective, integrate time delays due to finite transmission speeds and derive a normalization of the connectome. When applied to the data base of the Human Connectome project, we explain the emergence of frequency-specific network cores including the visual and default mode networks. These findings are robust across human subjects (N=100) and are a fundamental network property within the wave picture. The normalized connectome comprises the particle view in the limit of infinite transmission speeds and opens the applicability of graph theory to a wide range of novel network phenomena, including physiological and pathological brain rhythms. These two perspectives are orthogonal, but not incommensurable, when understood within the novel here proposed generalized framework of structural connectivity.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAll networks are composed of nodes and links, forming the structural frame, in which communication occurs. We demonstrate that graph theoretical tools make the implicit assumption of information transmission via exchange of bits, suggesting that the stronger connected nodes are more impactful upon the remainder of the network. This corollary does not extend to communication through oscillations, which is the prominent information carrier in brain networks. We extend traditional network analysis to the oscillatory domain and derive a novel network normalization including descriptive metrics. Along the prototypical example of the brain as a network, we illustrate the consequences of this novel approach and demonstrate that the normalization robustly explains the emergence of the prominent frequency-specific network cores, which cannot be understood within the traditional framework.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic strength is altered during synaptic plasticity by controlling the number of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) at excitatory synapses. In particular, during long-term potentiation and synaptic up-scaling, AMPARs are accumulated at synapses to increase synaptic strength. Neuronal activity leads to activity-dependent phosphorylation of AMPAR subunit GluA1, and subsequent increases in GluA1 surface expression, which can be achieved by either an increase in exocytosis or a decrease in endocytosis of the receptors. However, the molecular pathways underlying GluA1 phosphorylation-induced elevation of surface AMPAR expression are not completely understood. Here, we first employ fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to reveal that phosphorylation of GluA1 Serine 845 (S845) plays a more important role in receptor endocytosis than exocytosis during synaptic plasticity. Notably, endocytosis of AMPARs depends upon the clathrin adaptor, AP2, which recruits cargo proteins into endocytic clathrin coated pits. Importantly, the KRMK (Lysine-Arginine-Methionine-Lysine) motif in the carboxyl-terminus of GluA1 is suggested to be an AP2 binding site, but the exact function has not been defined. Moreover, the GluA1 KRMK motif is closely located to one of GluA1 phosphorylation sites, serine 845 (S845), and GluA1 S845 dephosphorylation is suggested to enhance endocytosis during long-term depression. In fact, we show that an increase in GluA1 S845 phosphorylation by two distinct forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation and synaptic up-scaling, diminishes the binding of the AP2 adaptor. This reduces endocytosis, resulting in elevation of GluA1 surface expression. We thus demonstrate a mechanism of GluA1 phosphorylation-regulated clathrin-mediated endocytosis of AMPARs.",

A complete understanding of nucleated cell death or bacterial cell death by MAC is essential for therapeutic interventions. The mechanism of MAC mediated cell death in nucleated cell is controversial. We know show that MAC causes cell death in nucleated cells by creating a large single hole in the membrane. Our results are contrary to the current paradigm that states \"MAC kills nucleated cell by multiple hits\". MAC deposition on the cell membrane also trigger clustering of membrane rafts, which will have relevant consequences for enhanced cell signaling.\n\nSignificance StatementProteins of late complement pathway that form membrane attack complex, cause death of undesirable nucleated cells such as lymphocytes.

How C9 pore forming protein assemble with rest of C5b-8 on nucleated cell membrane remains controversial. We thus examined and now show the structures formed by these proteins on nucleated cell membranes. Formation of MAC occurs during complement activation during infection and autoimmunity. Largely, our current knowledge of the membrane pore formation is gained using ghost cells, lipid micelles, and erythrocytes. Understanding of how MAC kills nucleated cells will enhance our ability to design new therapies for selective killing of pathogens.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundC. auris has become a globally emerging fungal pathogen, frequently reported to be multi-drug resistant, commonly found with Staphylococcus aureus in polymicrobial nosocomial infections. Although chlorhexidine (CHD) has been shown to be effective, it is associated with serious anaphylaxis reactions. Biofilm disrupters (BDs) are novel agents with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. BDs have been used in the management of chronic wounds and to sterilize environmental surfaces. The goal of this study was to evaluate BDs against polymicrobial biofilms compared to CHD.\n\nMethodologyWe evaluated various BDs (BlastX, Torrent, NSSD) and CHD against Candida spp and S. aureus polymicrobial biofilms by zone of inhibition, biofilm, and time-kill assays. Effectiveness was based on the inhibition zone and the reduction of CFU, respectively, compared to the drug-free control.\n\nResultsAll BDs and CHD inhibited C. auris growth effectively in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, CHD and the BDs all showed excellent antimicrobial activity against polymicrobial biofilms. BDs were all highly effective against both C. auris isolates, whereas CHD was only moderately effective against C. auris 0386, suggesting resistance/tolerance. A comparative analysis of the BDs and CHD against C. auris and C. albicans by biofilm kill-curves showed at least 99.999% killing.\n\nConclusionsAll three BDs and CHD have excellent activity against different Candida species, including C. auris. However, certain isolates of C. auris showed resistance/tolerance to CHD, but not to the BDs. The fungicidal activity of these novel agents will be valuable in eradicating surface colonization of Candida spp, including C. auris.",

    "abstract": "The nucleotide messenger (p)ppGpp allows bacteria to adapt to fluctuating environments by reprogramming the transcriptome. Yet despite its well-recognized role in gene regulation, (p)ppGpp is only known to directly affect transcription in Proteobacteria. Here we reveal a different mechanism of gene regulation by (p)ppGpp in Firmicutes from soil bacteria to pathogens: (p)ppGpp serves as a co-repressor of the transcription factor PurR to downregulate purine biosynthesis. We identified PurR as a receptor of (p)ppGpp in Bacillus anthracis and revealed that (p)ppGpp strongly enhances PurR binding to its regulon in the Bacillus subtilis genome. A co-structure reveals that (p)ppGpp binds to a PurR pocket reminiscent of the active site of PRT enzymes that has been repurposed to serve a purely regulatory role, where the effectors (p)ppGpp and PRPP compete to allosterically control transcription. PRPP inhibits PurR DNA binding to induce transcription of purine synthesis genes, whereas (p)ppGpp antagonizes PRPP to enhance PurR DNA binding and repress transcription. A (p)ppGpp-refractory purR mutant fails to downregulate purine synthesis genes upon starvation. Our work establishes precedent of (p)ppGpp as a classical transcription co-repressor and reveals the key function of (p)ppGpp in regulating nucleotide synthesis through gene regulation, from the human intestinal tract to host-pathogen interfaces.",

The aim of this study was to characterize the genetic pathways leading to high-level azithromycin resistance.\n\nMethodsA customized morbidostat was used to subject two N. gonorrhoeae reference strains (WHO-F and WHO-X) to dynamically sustained azithromycin pressure. We tracked stepwise evolution of resistance by whole genome sequencing.\n\nResultsWithin 26 days, all cultures evolved high-level azithromycin resistance. Typically, the first step towards resistance was found in transitory mutations in genes rplD, rplV and rpmH (encoding the ribosomal proteins L4, L22 and L34 respectively), followed by mutations in the MtrCDE-encoded efflux pump and the 23S rRNA gene. Low-to high-level resistance was associated with mutations in the ribosomal proteins and MtrCDE-encoded efflux pump. However, high-level resistance was consistently associated with mutations in the 23S ribosomal RNA - mainly the well-known A2059G and C2611T mutations, but also at position A2058G.\n\nConclusionsThis study enabled us to track previously reported mutations and identify novel mutations in ribosomal proteins (L4, L22 and L34) that may play a role in the genesis of azithromycin resistance in N. gonorrhoeae.",

    "abstract": "Morphospaces representations of phenotypic characteristics are often populated unevenly, leaving large parts unoccupied. Such patterns are typically ascribed to contingency, or else to natural selection disfavouring certain parts of the morphospace. The extent to which developmental bias, the tendency of certain phenotypes to preferentially appear as potential variation, also explains these patterns is hotly debated. Here we demonstrate quantitatively that developmental bias is the primary explanation for the occupation of the morphospace of RNA secondary structure (SS) shapes. Upon random mutations, some RNA SS shapes (the frequent ones) are much more likely to appear than others. By using the RNAshapes method to define coarse-grained SS classes, we can directly compare the frequencies that non-coding RNA SS shapes appear in the RNAcentral database to frequencies obtained upon random sampling of sequences. We show that: a) Only the most frequent structures appear in nature; the vast majority of possible structures in the morphospace have not yet been explored. b) Remarkably small numbers of random sequences are needed to produce all the RNA SS shapes found in nature so far. c) Perhaps most surprisingly, the natural frequencies are accurately predicted, over several orders of magnitude in variation, by the likelihood that structures appear upon uniform random sampling of sequences. The ultimate cause of these patterns is not natural selection, but rather strong phenotype bias in the RNA genotype-phenotype map, a type of developmental bias or \"findability constraint\", which limits evolutionary dynamics to a hugely reduced subset of structures that are easy to \"find\".",

    "abstract": "Characterization of genotype-phenotype relationships of genetically encoded molecules (e.g., ribozymes) requires accurate quantification of activity for a large set of molecules. Kinetic measurement using high-throughput sequencing (e.g., k-Seq) is an emerging assay applicable in various domains that potentially scales up measurement throughput to 105 ~ 106 unique sequences. However, technical challenges introduced by sequence heterogeneity and DNA sequencing must be understood to realize the utility and limitations of such assays. We characterized the k-Seq method in terms of model identifiability, effects of sequencing error, accuracy and precision using simulated datasets and experimental data from a variant pool constructed from previously identified ribozymes. Relative abundance, kinetic coefficients, and measurement noise were found to affect the measurement of each sequence. We introduced bootstrapping to robustly quantify the uncertainty in estimating model parameters and proposed interpretable metrics to quantify model identifiability. These efforts enabled the rigorous reporting of data quality for individual sequences in k-Seq experiments. Critical experimental factors were examined, and general guidelines are proposed to maximize the number of sequences having precisely estimated and identifiable kinetic coefficients from k-Seq data. Practices analogous to those laid out here could be applied to improve the rigor of similar sequencing-based assays.",

    "abstract": "Stroke often leads to chronic motor impairments in the paretic lower limb that can constrain lower extremity movement and negatively impact the ability to navigate stairs or curbs. This exploratory study investigated the differences in hip and knee biomechanical strategies during a step-up task between 5 adults with hemiparetic stroke and 5 age-matched adults without stroke. Participants were instructed to step up onto a 4-inch platform, where joint biomechanics were quantified for the hip in the frontal plane and the hip and knee in the sagittal plane. Peak joint kinematics were identified during the leading limb swing phase and peak joint moments and power were identified during the leading limb pull-up phase of stance. Mixed effects regression models estimated fixed effects of limb (3 levels: control dominant, stroke non-paretic, and stroke paretic) on biomechanical outcomes, while a random effect of participant controlled for within-participant correlations. Repeated assessments within participants (approximately 60 trials per lower limb) increased the effective sample size from 10 to between 12.0 to 19.6. Altered biomechanical strategies of the paretic lower limb included reduced flexion angles and increased pelvic obliquity angles during swing, decreased power generation in the hip frontal plane during stance, and decreased moment and power generation in the knee sagittal plane during stance. A strategy of substantial interest was the elevated hip sagittal plane moment and power generation in both stroke limbs. Overall, our findings suggest that chronic motor impairments from stroke can lead to inefficient biomechanical strategies when stepping up.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe organization and shape of the microstructural elements of trabecular bone govern its physical properties, are implicated in bone disease, and can serve as blueprints for biomaterial design. To devise fundamental structure-property relationships, it is essential to characterize trabecular bone from the perspective of geometry, the mathematical study of shape. Here, we used the micro-computed tomography images of 70 donors at five different sites to characterize the local and global geometry of human trabecular bone, respectively quantified by surface curvatures and Minkowski functionals. We find that curvature density maps provide sensitive shape fingerprints for bone from different sites. Contrary to a common assumption, these curvature maps also show that bone morphology does not approximate a minimal surface but exhibits a much more intricate curvature landscape. At the global (or integral) perspective, our Minkowski analysis illustrates that trabecular bone exhibits other types of anisotropy/ellipticity beyond interfacial orientation, and that anisotropy varies substantially within the trabecular structure. Moreover, we show that the Minkowski functionals unify several traditional morphometric indices. Our geometric approach to trabecular morphometry provides a fundamental language of shape that could be useful for bone failure prediction, understanding geometry-driven tissue growth, and the design of complex tissue engineering scaffolds.",

In lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) amenable to treatment with targeted inhibitors, transformation to an aggressive neuroendocrine (NE) carcinoma resembling small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a recognized mechanism of acquired resistance. Defining molecular mechanisms of NE transformation in lung cancer has been limited by a paucity of well annotated pre- and post-transformation clinical samples. We hypothesized that mixed histology LUAD/SCLC tumors may capture cancer cells proximal to, and on either side of, histologic transformation. We performed detailed genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of combined LUAD/SCLC tumors as well as pre- and post-transformation clinical samples. Our data support that NE transformation is primarily driven by transcriptional reprogramming rather than mutational events. We identify genomic contexts in which NE transformation is favored, including frequent loss of the 3p chromosome arm in pre-transformation LUADs. Consistent shifts in gene expression programs in NE transformation include induction of several stem/progenitor cell regulatory pathways, including upregulation of PRC2 and WNT signaling, and suppression of Notch pathway activity. We observe induction of PI3K/AKT and an immunosuppressive phenotype in NE transformation. Taken together our findings define a novel landscape of potential drivers and therapeutic vulnerabilities of NE transformation in lung cancer.",

As a result, an emerging therapeutic strategy is to target the pathobiological mechanisms downstream of T2D metabolic derangement that can result in organ damage, morbidity, and mortality in afflicted individuals. One such proposed mechanism involves the Protein Kinase C (PKC) family members PKC and PKC{beta}, which have been linked to diabetes-induced tissue damage to organs including the kidneys. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of dual inhibition of PKC and PKC{beta} in the context of T2D, we have evaluated a potent and orally bioavailable inhibitor, herein referred to as Cmpd 1, in the ZSF1 rat model of leptin-receptor deficiency, obesity-driven T2D. Therapeutic dosing of Cmpd 1 virtually halted renal function decline but did so indirectly by blunting the hyperphagia response of these animals.

These sub-phenotypes have varied outcomes and respond differently to several previously studied interventions. A more precise understanding of their pathobiology and an ability to prospectively identify them, may allow for the development of precision therapies in ARDS. Historically, animal models have played a key role in translational research, although few studies have so far assessed either the ability of animal models to replicate these sub-phenotypes or investigated the presence of sub-phenotypes within animal models. Here, in three ovine models of ARDS, using combinations of oleic acid and intravenous, or intratracheal lipopolysaccharide, we demonstrate the presence of sub-phenotypes which qualitatively resemble those found in clinical cohorts. Principal Components Analysis and partitional clustering reveal two clusters, differentiated by markers of shock, inflammation, and lung injury.

Motivated by diurnal cycles driving circadian clocks, we investigate the noise properties in the well-known Goodwin oscillator in the presence and absence of a periodic driving signal. We use two approaches to compute the noise as a function of time: (i) solving the moment dynamics derived from the linear noise approximation (LNA) assuming fluctuations are small relative to the mean and (ii) analyzing trajectories obtained from exact stochastic simulations of the Goodwin oscillator. Our results demonstrate that the LNA can predict the noise behavior quite accurately when the system shows damped oscillations or in the presence of external periodic forcing. However, the LNA could be misleading in the case of sustained oscillations without an external signal due to the propagation of large noise. Finally, we study the effect of random bursting of gene products on the clock stochastic dynamics. Our analysis reveals that the burst of mRNAs enhances the noise in the copy number regardless of the presence of external forcing, although the extent of fluctuations becomes less due to the forcing.",

    "abstract": "Consuming addictive drugs is often initially pleasurable, but escalating drug intake eventually recruits physiological \"anti-reward\" systems called opponent processes that cause tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. Opponent processes are fundamental for the addiction process, but their physiological basis is not fully characterized. Here, we propose an opponent processes mechanism centered on the endocrine stress-response, the HPA axis. We focus on alcohol addiction, where the HPA axis is activated and secretes {beta}-endorphin, causing euphoria and analgesia. Using a mathematical model, we show that slow changes in HPA glands act as an opponent process for {beta}-endorphin secretion. The model explains hormone dynamics in alcohol addiction, and experiments on alcohol preference in rodents. The opponent process is based on fold-change detection (FCD) where {beta}-endorphin responses are relative rather than absolute; FCD confers vulnerability to addiction but has adaptive roles for learning. Our model suggests gland-mass changes as potential targets for intervention in addiction.",

    "abstract": "The microtubule associated protein tau oligomerizes in response to stress and disease, but the function of oligomeric tau (oTau) and the ultimate mechanisms of toxicity are unknown. To gain insights, we have now used Cry2-based optogenetics to induce tau oligomers (oTau-c) in neuronal cultures. oTau-c can seed tau aggregation and biochemical fractionates in a manner similar to oTau. Optical induction of oTau elicits a translational stress response that includes cytoplasmic translocation of the TIA1, abundant stress granules (SGs) and reduced protein synthesis. Proteomic analysis identifies HNRNPA2B1 as a principle target of oTau. Imaging and immunoprecipitation verify the HNRNPA2B1 association with endogenous oTau in neurons, animal models and human Alzheimer brain tissue. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that HNRNPA2B1 functions as a linker, connecting oTau with N6-methyladenosine modified transcripts (m6A). Knockdown of HNRNPA2B1 prevents oTau from associating with m6A, prevents oTau-induced reductions in protein synthesis and reduces oTau-induced toxicity. Finally, we show striking increases in m6A-oTau and -HNRNPA2B1 complexes in brains of Alzheimer subjects and P301S tau mice.

    "abstract": "An important problem in sensory processing is how lateral interactions that mediate the integration of information across sensory channels function with respect to stimulus tuning. We demonstrate a novel form of selective crosstalk between specific olfactory channels that occurs between primary olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Neurotransmitter release from ORNs can be driven by two distinct sources of excitation, feedforward activity derived from the odorant receptor and lateral input originating from specific subsets of other ORNs. Consequently, levels of presynaptic release can become dissociated from firing rate. Stimulus-selective lateral signaling results in the distributed representation of CO2, a behaviorally important environmental cue that elicits spiking in only a single ORN class, in multiple olfactory channels. Different CO2-responsive channels preferentially transmit distinct stimulus dynamics, thereby expanding the coding bandwidth for CO2. These results generalize to additional odors and olfactory channels, revealing a subnetwork of lateral interactions between ORNs that reshape the spatial and temporal structure of odor representations in a stimulus-specific manner.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA novel subnetwork of stimulus-selective lateral interactions between primary olfactory sensory neurons enables new sensory computations.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that results in a progressive loss of motor function and ultimately death. It is critical, yet also challenging, to develop non-invasive biomarkers to identify, localize, measure and/or track biological mechanisms implicated in ALS. Such biomarkers may also provide clues to identify potential molecular targets for future therapeutic trials. Herein we report on a pilot study involving twelve participants with ALS and nine age-matched healthy controls who underwent high-resolution resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging at an ultra-high field of 7 Tesla. A group-level whole-brain analysis revealed a disruption in long-range functional connectivity between the superior sensorimotor cortex (in the precentral gyrus) and bilateral cerebellar lobule VI. Post hoc analyses using atlas-derived left and right cerebellar lobule VI revealed decreased functional connectivity in ALS participants that predominantly mapped to bilateral postcentral and precentral gyri. Cerebellar lobule VI is a transition zone between anterior motor networks and posterior non-motor networks in the cerebellum, and is associated with a wide range of key functions including complex motor and cognitive processing tasks. Our observation of the involvement of cerebellar lobule VI adds to the growing number of studies implicating the cerebellum in ALS. Future avenues of scientific investigation should consider how high-resolution imaging at 7T may be leveraged to visualize differences in functional connectivity disturbances in various genotypes and phenotypes of ALS along the ALS-frontotemporal dementia spectrum.",

To probe this issue, we discretely perturbed (with optogenetics) activity in BLA[-&gt;]GC axons during taste deliveries. This perturbation strongly altered GC taste responses, but while the perturbation itself was tonic (2s), the alterations were not--changes preferentially aligned with the onset times of previously-described taste response epochs, and reduced evidence of palatability-related activity in the \"late-epoch\" of the responses without reducing the amount of taste identity information available in the \"middle epoch.\" Finally, BLA[-&gt;]GC perturbations changed behavior-linked taste response dynamics themselves, distinctively diminishing the abruptness of ensemble transitions into the late epoch.

    "abstract": "The diurnal peak of phagocytosis by the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) of photoreceptor outer segments (POS) is under circadian control, and it is believed that this process involves interactions from both the retina and RPE. Previous studies have demonstrated that a functional circadian clock exists within multiple retinal cell types and RPE cells. Thereby, the aim of the current study was to determine whether the circadian clock in the retina and or RPE controls the diurnal phagocytic peak of photoreceptor outer segments and whether selective disruption of the circadian clock in the RPE would affect RPE cells function and the viability during aging. To that aim, we first generated and validated an RPE tissue-specific KO of the essential clock gene, Bmal1, and then we determined the daily rhythm in phagocytic activity by the RPE in mice lacking a functional circadian clock in the retina or RPE. Then using electroretinography, spectral domain-optical coherence tomography, and optomotor response measurements of visual function we determined the effect of Bmal1 removal in young (6-month old) and old (18-month old) mice. RPE morphology and lipofuscin accumulation was also determined in young and old mice. Our data show that the circadian clock in the RPE controls the daily diurnal phagocytic peak of POS. Surprisingly, the lack of a functional RPE circadian clock or the diurnal phagocytic peak does not result in any detectable age-related degenerative phenotype in the retina or RPE. Thus, our results demonstrate that the loss of the circadian clock in the RPE or the lack of the daily peak in phagocytosis of POS does not result in deterioration of photoreceptors or the RPE during aging.",

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that a reduction in adenylyl cyclase 1 (AC1) activity or expression would attenuate morphine tolerance and hypersensitivity, and inflammatory pain using murine models. To investigate opioid tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, mice were subjected to twice daily treatments of saline or morphine using either a static (15 mg/kg, 5 days) or an escalating tolerance paradigm (10-40 mg/kg, 4 days). Systemic treatment with an AC1 inhibitor, ST03437 (5 mg/kg, ip), reduced morphine tolerance and morphine hyperalgesia in mice. Lumbar intrathecal administration of a vector incorporating adeno-associated virus and short-hairpin RNA against Adcy1 reduced morphine induced hypersensitivity compared to control vector treated mice. In contrast, morphine antinociception, along with baseline thermal paw withdrawal latencies, motor performance, exploration in an open field test, and burrowing behaviors were not affected by intrathecal Adcy1 knockdown. Knockdown of Adcy1 by intrathecal injection also attenuated inflammatory mechanical hyperalgesia after intraplantar administration of Complete Freunds Adjuvant (CFA) after one week post injection. This Adcy1 knockdown strategy also increased burrowing and nesting activity after CFA injection when compared to controls. Together, these data indicate targeting AC1 to mitigate opioid-induced adverse effects, or as a method to treat chronic pain, are appropriate as a clinical approach and further development into generating pharmaceuticals targeting these genes/proteins may prove beneficial in the future.",

    "abstract": "Collective phenomena fascinate by the emergence of order in systems composed of a myriad of small entities. They are ubiquitous in nature and can be found over a vast range of scales in physical and biological systems. Their key feature is the seemingly effortless emergence of adaptive collective behavior that cannot be trivially explained by the properties of the systems individual components. This perspective focuses on recent insights into the similarities of correlations for two apparently disparate phenomena: flocking in animal groups and neuronal ensemble activity in the brain. We first will summarize findings on the spontaneous organization in bird flocks and macro-scale human brain activity utilizing correlation functions and insights from critical dynamics. We then will discuss recent experimental findings that apply these approaches to the collective response of neurons to visual and motor processing, i.e. to local perturbations of neuronal networks at the meso- and microscale. We show how scale-free correlation functions capture the collective organization of neuronal avalanches in evoked neuronal populations in nonhuman primates and between neurons during visual processing in rodents. These experimental findings suggest that the coherent collective neural activity observed at scales much larger than the length of the direct neuronal interactions is demonstrative of a phase transition. We discuss the experimental support for either discontinuous or continuous phase transitions. We conclude that at or near a phase-transition neuronal information can propagate in the brain with the same efficiency as proposed to occur in the collective adaptive response observed in some animal groups.",

However, the mechanisms by which pregravid obesity disrupts the pregnancy associated \"immune clock\" are still unknown. To address this question, we collected blood samples from women during the first and third trimesters and determined the impact of both pregnancy and pregravid obesity on circulating immune mediators, immune cell subset frequencies, and peripheral immune responses. While regardless of BMI, pregnancy was associated with an elevation in both Th1 and Th2 cytokines, pregravid obesity was associated with a dysregulation in circulating myeloid factors at term. Moreover, pregnancy in lean subjects was associated with enhanced monocyte activation, augmented chromatin accessibility at inflammatory loci, and heightened responses to LPS. Pregravid obesity disrupted this trajectory and was accompanied by a lack of transcriptional and epigenetic changes and alterations in metabolic status strongly suggesting a skewing towards immunotolerance. These findings provide novel insight into the increased susceptibility to infections observed with obesity during pregnancy.\n\nSUMMARYA healthy pregnancy is associated with progressive innate immune activation. Maternal factors such as obesity compromise this myeloid cell activation trajectory at genomic, epigenomic, functional, and metabolic levels, resulting in stagnant immune responses, suggestive of a state of tolerance.",

Analysis of strains expressing fluorescent reporter proteins revealed instances where only one of the parental nuclei was present in the terminal sporulating basidium. Whole-genome sequencing revealed the nuclear genome of the progeny was identical with one or the other parental genome. Pseudosexual reproduction was also detected in natural isolate crosses where it resulted in mainly MAT progeny, a bias observed in Cryptococcus ecological distribution as well. The meiotic recombinase Dmc1 was found to be critical for pseudosexual reproduction.

But certain motifs can also evolve more easily than others. Here, we computationally evolved TRNs to produce a pulse of an effector protein. Two well-known motifs, type 1 incoherent feed-forward loops (I1FFLs) and negative feedback loops (NFBLs), evolved as the primary solutions. Which motif evolves more often depends on selection conditions, but under all conditions, either motif achieves similar performance. I1FFLs generally evolve more often than NFBLs, unless we select for a tall pulse. I1FFLs are more evolutionarily accessible early on, before the effector protein evolves high expression; when NFBLs subsequently evolve, they tend to do so from a conjugated I1FFL-NFBL genotype. In the empirical S. cerevisiae TRN, output genes of NFBLs had higher expression levels than those of I1FFLs. These results suggest that evolutionary accessibility, and not relative functionality, shapes which motifs evolve in TRNs, and does so as a function of the expression levels of particular genes.",

Clustering chromatin accessibility profiles of 66,843 total nuclei identified 14 immune cell types and sub-types. We mapped chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in each immune cell type and sub-type which identified 6,248 total caQTLs, including those obscured from assays of bulk tissue such as with divergent effects on different cell types. For 3,379 caQTLs we further annotated putative target genes of variant activity using single cell co-accessibility, and caQTL variants were significantly correlated with the accessibility level of linked gene promoters. We fine-mapped loci associated with 16 complex immune traits and identified immune cell caQTLs at 517 candidate causal variants, including those with cell type-specific effects. At the 6q15 locus associated with type 1 diabetes, in line with previous reports, variant rs72928038 was a naive CD4+ T cell caQTL linked to BACH2 and we validated the allelic effects of this variant on regulatory activity in Jurkat T cells.

Despite the importance of both the lymphatic system and SF in OA disease, their relationship is still poorly understood. Here, we utilized SF derived from osteoarthritis patients (OASF) and healthy individuals (HSF) to investigate potential effects of SF on migration of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in vitro, and lymphatic contractility of femoral lymphatic vessels (LVs) ex vivo. Both OASF and HSF treatments led to an increased migratory response in vitro compared to LECs treatment with media without serum. Ex vivo, both OASF and HSF treatments to the lumen of isolated LVs led to significant differences in the tonic and phasic contractions and these observations were dependent on the SF treatment time. Specifically, OASF treatment transiently enhanced the RFLVs tonic contractions. Regarding the phasic contractions, OASF generated either an abrupt reduction after 1 hr of treatment or a complete cease of contractions after an overnight treatment, while HSF treatment displayed a gradual decrease in lymphatic contractility. The observed variations after SF treatments suggest that the pump function of lymphatic vessel draining the joint could be directly compromised in OA and thus might present a new therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "The Gene Ontology (GO) is a cornerstone of functional genomics research that drives discoveries through knowledge-informed computational analysis of biological data from large- scale assays. Key to this success is how the GO can be used to support hypotheses or conclusions about the biology or evolution of a study system by identifying annotated functions that are overrepresented in subsets of genes of interest. Graphical visualisations of such GO term enrichment results are critical to aid interpretation and avoid biases by presenting researchers with intuitive visual data summaries. Amongst current visualisation tools and resources there is a lack of standalone open-source software solutions that facilitate systematic comparisons of multiple lists of GO terms. To address this we developed GO-Figure!, an open-source Python software for producing user-customisable semantic similarity scatterplots of redundancy-reduced GO term lists. The lists are simplified by grouping together GO terms with similar functions using their quantified information contents and semantic similarities, with user-control over grouping thresholds. Representatives are then selected for plotting in two-dimensional semantic space where similar GO terms are placed closer to each other on the scatterplot, with an array of user-customisable graphical attributes. GO-Figure! offers a simple solution for command-line plotting of informative summary visualisations of lists of GO terms, designed to support exploratory data analyses and multiple dataset comparisons.",

    "abstract": "Patients with a disorder of mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid {beta}-oxidation (FAO) have reduced fasting tolerance and may present with hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, (cardio)myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Patients should avoid a catabolic state because it increases reliance on FAO as energy source. It is currently unclear whether weight loss through a reduction of caloric intake is safe in patients with a FAO disorder. We used the long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase knockout (LCAD KO) mouse model to study the impact of dietary restriction (DR) on the plasma metabolite profile and cardiac function. For this, LCAD KO and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to DR (70% of ad libitum chow intake) for 4 weeks and compared to ad libitum chow fed mice. We found that DR had a relatively small impact on the plasma metabolite profile of WT and LCAD KO mice. Echocardiography revealed a small decrease in left ventricular systolic function of LCAD KO mice, which was most noticeable after DR, but there was no evidence of DR-induced cardiac remodeling. Our results suggest that weight loss through DR does not have acute and detrimental consequences in a mouse model for FAO disorders.",

In our experiments, we use the {beta}-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter system to demonstrate transformation of ash callus tissue. Moreover, we describe an antibiotic-resistance based selection process enabling formation of stable transgenic callus lines.

    "abstract": "Prenatal maternal immune activation (MIA) is a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders. How gestational timing of MIA-exposure differentially impacts downstream development remains unclear. Here, we characterize neurodevelopmental trajectories of mice exposed to MIA induced by poly I:C either early (gestational day [GD]9) or late (GD17) in gestation using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging from weaning to adulthood. Early MIA-exposure associated with accelerated brain volume increases in adolescence/early-adulthood that normalized in later adulthood, in regions including the striatum, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex. Similarly, alterations in anxiety, stereotypic, and sensorimotor gating behaviours observed in adolescence normalized in adulthood. In contrast, MIA-exposure in late gestation had less impact on anatomical and behavioural profiles. Using a multivariate technique to relate imaging and behavioural variables for the time of greatest alteration, i.e. adolescence/early adulthood, we demonstrate that variation in anxiety, social, and sensorimotor gating associates significantly with volume of regions including the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex. Using RNA sequencing to explore the molecular underpinnings of region-specific alterations in early MIA-exposed mice in adolescence, we observed the most transcriptional changes in the dorsal hippocampus, with regulated genes enriched for fibroblast growth factor regulation, autistic behaviours, inflammatory pathways, and microRNA regulation. This indicates that MIA in early gestation perturbs brain development mechanisms implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders. Our findings demonstrate the inherent strength of an integrated hypothesis- and data-driven approach in linking brain-behavioural alterations to the transcriptome to understand how MIA confers risk for major mental illness.",

We represent brain states as functional networks obtained from intracranial electroen-cephalography recordings, using correlation and the phase locking value to quantify the coupling between different brain areas.\n\nOur method is based on graph neural networks (GNNs) and the attention mechanism, two of the most significant advances in artificial intelligence in recent years. Specifically, we train a GNN to distinguish between functional networks associated with interictal and ictal phases. The GNN is equipped with an attention-based layer that automatically learns to identify those regions of the brain (associated with individual electrodes) that are most important for a correct classification. The localisation of these regions does not require any prior information regarding the seizure onset zone.\n\nWe show that the regions of interest identified by the GNN strongly correlate with the localisation of the seizure onset zone reported by electroencephalographers. We report results both for human patients and for simulators of brain activity. We also show that our GNN exhibits uncertainty on those patients for which the clinical localisation was unsuccessful, highlighting the robustness of the proposed approach.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic regulation has proven to play a critical role in T cell antitumor immunity. Cholesterol metabolism is a key component of this response but remains largely unexplored. Herein, we found that the LDL receptor (LDLR), which has been previously identified as a transporter for cholesterol and fatty acids, plays a pivotal role in regulating CD8+ T cell antitumor activity, with the genetic ablation of LDLR significantly attenuating CD8+ T cell activation and clonal expansion. Additionally, we found that LDLR interacts with the T-cell receptor (TCR) signalosome and regulates TCR signaling, facilitating CD8+ T cell activation and effector function. Furthermore, we found that the tumor microenvironment downregulates CD8+ T cell LDLR levels and TCR signaling via tumor cell-derived PCSK9, which binds and prevents the recycling of LDLR and TCR into the plasma membrane. Our findings indicate that genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9 in tumor cells can enhance the antitumor activity of CD8+ T cells by alleviating the tumor microenvironments suppressive effect on CD8+ T cells and consequently inhibit tumor progression. While previously established as a hyperlipidemia target, this study highlights PCSK9 as a potential target for cancer immunotherapy as well.",

    "abstract": "Recent clinical experience has demonstrated that adoptive regulatory T cell therapy is a safe and feasible strategy to suppress immunopathology via induction of host tolerance to allo- and autoantigens. However, clinical trials continue to be compromised due to an inability to manufacture a sufficient Treg cell dose. Multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC) promote regulatory T cell differentiation in vitro, suggesting they may be repurposed to enhance ex vivo expansion of Tregs for adoptive cellular therapy. Here, we use a GMP compatible Treg expansion platform to demonstrate that MAPC cell-co-cultured Tregs (MulTreg) exhibit a log-fold increase in yield across two independent cohorts, reducing time to target dose by an average of 30%. Enhanced expansion is linked with a distinct Treg cell-intrinsic transcriptional program, characterized by diminished levels of core exhaustion (BATF, ID2, PRDM1, LAYN, DUSP1), and quiescence (TOB1, TSC22D3) related genes, coupled to elevated expression of cell-cycle and proliferation loci (MKI67, CDK1, AURKA, AURKB). In addition, MulTreg display a unique gut homing (CCR7lo {beta}7hi) phenotype and importantly, are more readily expanded from patients with autoimmune disease compared to matched Treg lines, suggesting clinical utility in gut and/or Th1-driven pathology associated with autoimmunity or transplantation. Relative to expanded Tregs, MulTreg retain equivalent and robust purity, FoxP3 TSDR demethylation, nominal effector cytokine production and potent suppression of Th1-driven antigen specific and polyclonal responses in vitro and xeno graft vs host disease (xGvHD) in vivo. These data support the use of MAPC cell co-culture in adoptive Treg therapy platforms as a means to rescue expansion failure and reduce the time required to manufacture a stable, potently suppressive product.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages (phages) are ubiquitous in nature. These viruses play a number of central roles in microbial ecology and evolution by, for instance, promoting horizontal gene transfer (HGT) among bacterial species. The ability of phages to mediate HGT through transduction has been widely exploited as an experimental tool for the genetic study of bacteria. As such, bacteriophage P1 represents a prototypical generalized transducing phage with a broad host range that has been extensively employed in the genetic manipulation of Escherichia coli and a number of other model bacterial species. Here we demonstrate that P1 is capable of infecting, lysogenizing and promoting transduction in members of the bacterial genus Sodalis, including the maternally inherited insect endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius. While establishing new tools for the genetic study of these bacterial species, our results suggest that P1 may be used to deliver DNA to many Gram negative endosymbionts in their insect host, thereby circumventing a culturing requirement to genetically manipulate these organisms.\n\nSummaryA large number of economically important insects maintain intimate associations with maternally inherited endosymbiotic bacteria. Due to the inherit nature of these associations, insect endosymbionts cannot be usually isolated in pure culture nor genetically manipulated. Here we use a broad-host range bacteriophage to deliver exogenous DNA to an insect endosymbiont and a closely related free-living species. Our results suggest that broad host range bacteriophages can be used to genetically alter insect endosymbionts in their insect host and, as a result, bypass a culturing requirement to genetically alter these bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Despite its epidemiological importance, the time Plasmodium parasites take to achieve development in the vector mosquito (the extrinsic incubation period, EIP) remains poorly characterized. A novel non-destructive assay designed to estimate EIP in single mosquitoes, and more broadly to study Plasmodium - Anopheles vectors interactions, is presented. The assay uses small pieces of cotton wool soaked in sugar solution to collect malaria sporozoites from individual mosquitoes during sugar feeding to monitor infection status over time. This technique has been tested across four natural malaria mosquito species of Africa and Asia, six parasite isolates of Plasmodium falciparum, and across a range of temperatures relevant to malaria transmission in field conditions. We find that monitoring individual infectious mosquitoes is feasible, although due to the frequency of mosquito sugar feeding and inter-individual variation in infection intensity, there is inherent risk that this technique will result in some false negatives. The sensitivity rate ranged from 0.27 to 0.81 depending on mosquito species and on infection intensity in mosquitoes used to collect saliva. Using this non-destructive technique, the estimated median extrinsic incubation period of P. falciparum at 27{degrees}C was 11 to 14 days depending on mosquito species and parasite isolate. Long-term individual tracking also revealed that sporozoite transfer onto cotton wool can occur at least until day 40 post-infection. In addition to contributing to a better understanding of EIP and mosquito to human transmission with implications for improving epidemiological models, this technique also allows to link different transmission traits at the mosquito individual level. As one example, we found a significant relationship between EIP and mosquito lifespan, with short individual EIP associated with short mosquito lifespan. Correlations between mosquito/parasite traits often reveal trade-offs and constraints and have important implications for understanding the evolution of parasite transmission strategies.",

Remarkably, in addition to the effect on RAD18 mRNA stability via controlling its poly(A) tail, TENT4A indirectly regulates RAD18 via the tumor suppressor CYLD, and via the long non-coding antisense RNA PAXIP1-AS2, which had no known function. Knocking down the expression of TENT4A or CYLD, or overexpression of PAXIP1-AS2 led each to reduced amounts of the RAD18 protein and DNA polymerase {eta}, leading to reduced TLS, highlighting PAXIP1-AS2 as a new TLS regulator.

    "abstract": "Fossils provide our only direct window into evolutionary events in the distant past. Incorporating them into phylogenetic hypotheses of living clades can help elucidate macroevolutionary patterns and processes, such as ancestral states and diversification dynamics. However, the effect fossils have on phylogenetic inference from morphological data remains controversial. Previous studies have highlighted their strong impact on topologies inferred from empirical data, but have not demonstrated that they improve accuracy. The consequences of explicitly incorporating the stratigraphic ages of fossils using tip-dated inference are also unclear. Here we employ a simulation approach to explore how fossil sampling and missing data affect tree reconstruction across a range of inference methods. Our results show that fossil taxa improve phylogenetic analysis of morphological datasets, even when highly fragmentary. Irrespective of inference method, fossils improve the accuracy of phylogenies and increase the number of resolved nodes. They also induce the collapse of ancient and highly uncertain relationships that tend to be incorrectly resolved when sampling only extant taxa. Furthermore, tip-dated analyses which simultaneously infer tree topology and divergence times outperform all other methods of inference, demonstrating that the stratigraphic ages of fossils contain vital phylogenetic information. Fossils help to extract true phylogenetic signals from morphology, an effect that is mediated by both their unique morphology and their temporal information, and their incorporation in total-evidence phylogenetics is necessary to faithfully reconstruct evolutionary history.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany important applications in bioinformatics, including sequence alignment and protein family profiling, employ sequence weighting schemes to mitigate the effects of non-independence of homologous sequences and under- or over-representation of certain taxa in a dataset. These schemes aim to assign high weights to sequences that are  novel compared to the others in the same dataset, and low weights to sequences that are over-represented.\n\nResultsWe formalise this principle by rigorously defining the evolutionary  novelty of a sequence within an alignment. This results in new sequence weights that we call  phylogenetic novelty scores. These scores have various desirable properties, and we showcase their use by considering, as an example application, the inference of character frequencies at an alignment column -- important, for example, in protein family profiling. We give computationally efficient algorithms for calculating our scores and, using simulations, show that they improve the accuracy of character frequency estimation compared to existing sequence weighting schemes.\n\nConclusionsOur phylogenetic novelty scores can be useful when an evolutionarily meaningful system for adjusting for uneven taxon sampling is desired. They have numerous possible applications, including estimation of evolutionary conservation scores and sequence logos, identification of targets in conservation biology, and improving and measuring sequence alignment accuracy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundViruses are ubiquitous biological entities, estimated to be the largest reservoirs of unexplored genetic diversity on Earth. Full functional characterization and annotation of newly-discovered viruses requires tools to enable taxonomic assignment, the range of hosts, and biological properties of the virus. Here we focus on prokaryotic viruses, which include phages and archaeal viruses, and for which identifying the viral host is an essential step in characterizing the virus, as the virus relies on the host for survival. Currently, the method for determining the viral host is either to culture the virus, which is low-throughput, time-consuming, and expensive, or to computationally predict the viral hosts, which needs improvements at both accuracy and usability. Here we develop a Gaussian model to predict hosts for prokaryotic viruses with better performances than previous computational methods.\n\nResultsWe present here Prokaryotic virus Host Predictor (PHP), a software tool using a Gaussian model, to predict hosts for prokaryotic viruses using the differences of Ae-mer frequencies between viral and host genomic sequences as features. PHP gave a host prediction accuracy of 34% (genus level) on the VirHostMatcher benchmark dataset and a host prediction accuracy of 35% (genus level) on a new dataset containing 671 viruses and 60,105 prokaryotic genomes. The prediction accuracy exceeded that of two alignment-free methods (VirHostMatcher and WIsH, 28%-34%, genus level). PHP also outperformed these two alignment-free methods much (24%-38%vs 18%-20%, genus level) when predicting hosts for prokaryotic viruses which cannot be predicted by the BLAST-based or the CRISPR-spacer-based methods alone. Requiring a minimal score for making predictions (thresholding) and taking the consensus of the top 30 predictions further improved the host prediction accuracy of PHP.\n\nConclusionsThe Prokaryotic virus Host Predictor software tool provides an intuitive and user-friendly API for the Gaussian model described herein. This work will facilitate the rapid identification of hosts for newly-identified prokaryotic viruses in metagenomic studies.\n\nAuthor SummaryProkaryotic viruses which include phages and archaeal viruses play an important role in balancing the global ecosystem by regulating the composition of bacteria and archaea in water and soil. Identifying the viral host is essential for characterizing the virus, as the virus relies on the host for survival. Currently, the method for determining the viral host is either to culture the virus which is low-throughput, time-consuming, and expensive, or to computationally predict the viral hosts which needs improvements at both accuracy and usability. This study developed a Gaussian model to predict hosts for prokaryotic viruses with better performances than previous computational methods. It will contribute to the rapid identification of hosts for prokaryotic viruses in metagenomic studies, and will extend our knowledge of virus-host interactions.",

    "abstract": "Despite the efforts of many within the drug development and clinical community surrogate biomarkers for patient survival have remained elusive in Oncology. This failure in part is attributable to there being a paucity of clinical trials showing a treatment effect on patient survival. Given this issue an alternative system to explore the surrogacy potential of biomarkers are large preclinical xenograft studies i.e. panel of patient derived xenografts or mouse clinical trials. In this study we explored the surrogacy potential of tumour burden biomarkers, current size of tumour and how its changed, preclinically in a large patient derived xenograft database which contains a diverse number of drugs/treatments (n=61) and xenografts (n=245). We found that of the possible 1830 two-arm mouse trials, 1103 showed a treatment effect on the preclinical end-point, disease progression, (p<0.05). Of these only in 30% did tumour burden markers fully capture the treatment effect on disease progression times i.e. satisfied a key condition for surrogacy. These results highlight that preclinically it is very challenging to find a surrogate marker based purely on measures of tumour burden.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are part of the tumour microenvironment and have been implicated in tumour progression. We found the number of MSCs significantly increased in tumour-burdened mice driven by Fas-threshold signalling. Consequently, MSCs lacking Fas lost their ability to induce metastasis development in a pancreatic cancer model. Mixing of MSCs with pancreatic cancer cells led to sustained production of the pro-metastatic cytokines CCL2 and IL6 by the stem cells. The levels of these cytokines depended on the number of MSCs, linking Fas-mediated MSC-proliferation to their capacity to promote tumour progression. Furthermore, we discovered that CCL2 and IL6 were induced by pancreatic cancer cell-derived IL1. Analysis of patient transcriptomic data revealed that high FasL expression correlates with high levels of MSC markers as well as increased IL6 and CCL2 in pancreatic tumours. Moreover, both FasL and CCL2 are linked to elevated levels of markers specific for monocytes known to possess further pro-metastatic activities. These results confirm our experimental findings of a FasL-MSC-IL1-CCL2/IL6 axis in pancreatic cancer and highlight the role MSCs play in tumour progression.",

These improvements were linked to IRE1/XBP1s-induced remodeling of the liver transcriptome, which dampened glucose production and reduced hepatic steatosis. Further, we show that IXA4 treatment enhanced pancreatic {beta} cell function and insulin homeostasis, indicating that systemic activation of IRE1/XBP1s signaling engendered multi-tissue benefits that integrated to mitigate systemic metabolic dysfunction in DIO mice. Our findings show that selective pharmacological activation of protective IRE1/XBP1s signaling reprograms multiple metabolic tissues, such as liver and pancreas, and represents a potential strategy to correct metabolic alterations in obesity.",

    "abstract": "5-methylcytosine (5mC) is a modified base often described as necessary for the proper regulation of genes and transposons and for the maintenance of genome integrity in plants. However, the extent of this dogma is limited by the current phylogenetic sampling of land plant species diversity. Here, we report that a monocot plant, Spirodela polyrhiza, has lost CG gene body methylation, genome-wide CHH methylation, and the presence or expression of several genes in the highly conserved RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. It has also lost the CHH methyltransferase CHROMOMETHYLASE 2. Consequently, the transcriptome is depleted of 24-nucleotide, heterochromatic, small interfering RNAs that act as guides for the deposition of 5mC to RdDM-targeted loci in all other currently sampled angiosperm genomes. Although the genome displays low levels of genome-wide 5mC primarily at LTR retrotransposons, CG maintenance methylation is still functional. In contrast, CHG methylation is weakly maintained even though H3K9me2 is present at loci dispersed throughout the euchromatin and highly enriched at regions likely demarcating pericentromeric regions. Collectively, these results illustrate that S. polyrhiza is maintaining CG and CHG methylation mostly at repeats in the absence of small RNAs. S. polyrhiza reproduces rapidly through clonal propagation in aquatic environments, which we hypothesize may enable low levels of maintenance methylation to persist in large populations.\n\nSignificance StatementDNA methylation is a widespread chromatin modification that is regularly found in all plant species. By examining one aquatic duckweed species, Spirodela polyrhiza, we find that it has lost highly conserved genes involved in methylation of DNA at sites often associated with repetitive DNA, and within genes, however DNA methylation and heterochromatin is maintained during cell division at other sites. Consequently, small RNAs that normally guide methylation to silence repetitive DNA like retrotransposons are diminished. Despite the loss of a highly conserved methylation pathway, and the reduction of small RNAs that normally target repetitive DNA, transposons have not proliferated in the genome, perhaps due in part to the rapid, clonal growth lifestyle of duckweeds.",

    "abstract": "Extinction learning, the ability to update previously learned information by integrating novel contradictory information, is a key mechanism for adapting our behavior and of high clinical relevance for therapeutic approaches to the modulation of maladaptive memories. Insect models have been instrumental in uncovering fundamental processes of memory formation and memory update. Recent experimental results in Drosophila melanogaster suggest that, after the behavioral extinction of a memory, two parallel but opposing memory traces coexist, residing at different sites within the mushroom body. Here we propose a minimalistic circuit model of the Drosophila mushroom body that supports classical appetitive and aversive conditioning and memory extinction. The model is tailored to the existing anatomical data and involves two circuit motives of central functional importance. It employs plastic synaptic connections between Kenyon cells and mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) in separate and mutually inhibiting appetitive and aversive learning pathways. Recurrent modulation of plasticity through projections from MBONs to reinforcement-mediating dopaminergic neurons implements a simple reward prediction mechanism. A distinct set of four MBONs encodes odor valence and predicts behavioral model output. Subjecting our model to learning and extinction protocols reproduced experimental results from recent behavioral and imaging studies. Simulating the experimental blocking of synaptic output of individual neurons or neuron groups in the model circuit confirmed experimental results and allowed formulation of testable predictions. In the temporal domain, our model achieves rapid learning with a step-like increase in the encoded odor value after a single pairing of the conditioned stimulus with a reward or punishment, facilitating single-trial learning.",

    "abstract": "Ageing disrupts the finely tuned excitation/inhibition balance (E:I) across cortex, driven by a natural decline in inhibitory tone ({gamma}-amino butyric acid, GABA). This causes functional decrements. However, in young adults, experimentally lowering GABA in sensorimotor cortex enhances adaptation memory. Therefore, using a cross-sectional design, here we tested the hypothesis that as sensorimotor cortical GABA declines naturally with age, adaptation memory would increase, and the former would explain the latter. Results confirmed this prediction. To probe causality, we used brain stimulation to further lower sensorimotor cortical GABA during adaptation. Across individuals, how stimulation changed memory depended on sensorimotor cortical E:I. In those with low E:I, stimulation increased memory; in those with high E:I stimulation reduced memory. Thus, we identify a form of motor memory that improves naturally with age, depends causally on sensorimotor cortex neurochemistry, and may be a potent target for motor skill preservation strategies in healthy ageing and neurore-habilitation.",

    "abstract": "Reaching for an object in space forms the basis for many activities of daily living and is important in rehabilitation after stroke and in other neurological and orthopedic conditions. It has been the object of motor control and neuroscience research for over a century, but studies often constrain movement to eliminate the effect of gravity or reduce the degrees of freedom. In some studies, aging has been shown to reduce target accuracy, with a mechanism suggested to be impaired corrective movements. We sought first to explore the changes in control of shoulder and elbow joint movements that occur with aging during performance of reaching movements to different target heights with the normal effects of gravity, unconstrained hand movement, and stable target locations. Three-dimensional kinematic data and electromyography were collected in 14 young (25{+/-}6 years) and 10 older adults (68{+/-}3 years) during second-long reaches to three targets aligned vertically in front of the participants. Older adults took longer to initiate a movement than the young adults and were more variable and inaccurate in their initial and final movements. Target height had greater effect on trajectory curvature variability in older than young adults, with angle variability relative to target position being greater in older adults around the time of peak speed. There were significant age-related differences in use of the multiple degrees of freedom of the upper extremity, with less variability in shoulder abduction in the older group. Muscle activation patterns were similar, except for a higher biceps-triceps co-contraction and tonic levels of some proximal muscle activation. The path length of movements was not affected by age. These results show an age-related deficit in the motor planning and online correction of reaching movements against a predictable force (i.e., gravity). These results will facilitate interpretation of our forthcoming study of transcranial magnetic stimulation effects on the same task in these two populations, and is relevant to any study that seeks to measure the effect of pathological processes on upper extremity motor performance in the elderly.",

    "abstract": "The discovery and development of novel antiseizure drugs (ASDs) that are effective in controlling pharmacoresistant spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRSs) continues to represent a significant unmet clinical need. The Epilepsy Therapy Screening Program (ETSP) has undertaken efforts to address this need by adopting animal models that represent the salient features of human pharmacoresistant epilepsy and employing these models for preclinical testing of investigational ASDs. One such model that has garnered increased interest in recent years is the mouse variant of the Intra-Amygdala Kainate (IAK) microinjection model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). In establishing a version of this model, several methodological variables were evaluated for their effect(s) on pertinent quantitative endpoints. Although administration of a benzodiazepine 40 minutes after kainate (KA) induced status epilepticus (SE) is commonly used to improve survival, data presented here demonstrates similar outcomes (mortality, hippocampal damage, latency periods, and 90-day SRS natural history) between mice given midazolam and those that were not. Using a version of this model that did not interrupt SE with a benzodiazepine, a 90-day natural history study was performed and survival, latency periods, SRS frequencies and durations, and SRS clustering data were quantified. Finally, an important step towards model adoption is to assess the sensitivities or resistances of SRSs to a panel of approved and clinically used ASDs. Accordingly, the following ASDs were evaluated for their effects on SRSs in these mice: phenytoin (20 mg/kg, b.i.d.), carbamazepine (30 mg/kg, t.i.d.), valproate (240 mg/kg, t.i.d.), diazepam (4 mg/kg, b.i.d.), and phenobarbital (25 and 50 mg/kg, b.i.d.). Valproate, diazepam, and phenobarbital significantly attenuated SRS frequency relative to vehicle controls at doses devoid of observable adverse behavioral effects. Only diazepam significantly increased seizure freedom. Neither phenytoin nor carbamazepine significantly altered SRS frequency or freedom under these experimental conditions. These data demonstrate that SRSs in this IAK model of MTLE are pharmacoresistant to two representative sodium channel-inhibiting ASDs (phenytoin and carbamazepine) but not to GABA receptor modulating ASDs (diazepam and phenobarbital) or a mixed-mechanism ASD (valproate). Accordingly, this model is being incorporated into the NINDS-funded ETSP testing platform for treatment resistant epilepsy.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAn intra-amygdala kainate model of TLE was evaluated for pharmacoresistant seizures\nC_LIO_LIAdministration of midazolam during status epilepticus did not affect mortality\nC_LIO_LIModel characteristics were evaluated over a 90-day natural history study\nC_LIO_LISpontaneous seizures were resistant to phenytoin and carbamazepine\nC_LIO_LISpontaneous seizures were sensitive to valproic acid, diazepam, and phenobarbital\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "HLA-E is a non-classical class Ib molecule that has limited polymorphism and binds HLA class Ia leader peptides (VL9). HLA-E-VL9 complexes interact with the natural killer (NK) cell receptors NKG2A-C/CD94 and regulate NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Here we isolated a murine IgM antibody 3H4, that specifically recognized HLA-E-VL9 bound complexes and enhanced killing of HLA-E-VL9-expressing cells by an NKG2A+ NK cell line. Structural analysis revealed how 3H4 prevents CD94/NKG2A docking on HLA-E-VL9 by binding with an overlapping footprint. Upon in vitro maturation, an affinity-optimized 3H4 IgG showed enhanced NK killing of HLA-E-VL9-expressing cells. Remarkably, HLA-E-VL9-specific IgM autoantibodies with similar specificity and functions to 3H4 were subsequently isolated from naive B cells of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-negative, healthy male human donors. Thus, a repertoire of germline low affinity HLA-E-VL9-reactive antibodies are present in both naive human and murine B cell repertoires. These antibodies can enhance NK cell cytotoxicity and therefore have potential for therapeutic modulation of NK cell function.",

    "abstract": "Variations in both the behavior of wildlife and the scale at which the environment most influences the space use of wild animals (i.e., scale of effect) are critical, but often overlooked in habitat selection modeling. Ecologists have proposed that biological responses happening over longer time frames are influenced by environmental variables at larger spatial scales, but this has rarely been empirically tested. Here, we hypothesized that long-term patterns of behavior (i.e. lasting multiple weeks to months) would be associated with larger scales of effect than more sporadic behaviors. We predicted site use by 43 radio-telemetered timber rattlesnakes (Crotalus horridus) exhibiting four distinct, time-varying behaviors (foraging, digestion, ecdysis, and gestation) using remotely-sensed environmental variables related to forest structure and landscape topography. Among sites used by snakes, warmer temperatures and higher levels of forest disturbance were predictive of behaviors dependent on thermoregulation including gestation and ecdysis while more moderate temperatures and drier, more oak-dominated sites were predictive of foraging. Long-term behaviors were associated with larger spatial scales, supporting our hypothesis that the scale at which habitat selection occurs is linked to the temporal scale of relevant behaviors. Management recommendations based on single-scale models of habitat use that do not account for fine-scale variations in behavior may obscure the importance of potentially limiting habitat features needed for infrequent behaviors that are critically important for growth and reproduction of this and related species.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary emergence of the first animals is thought to have been intimately associated to the formation of a primitive endomesodermal gut (i.e gastrulation) from ancestral multi-cellular spheres, blastulae, more than 700 million years ago. However, the biochemical cues having been at the origin of endomesoderm formation remain a mystery.\n\nHere we find that hydrodynamic mechanical strains developed by sea wavelets on pre-bilaterian Nematostella vectensis and pre-metazoan Choanoeca flexa representatives, which common ancestor dates back to more than 700 million years ago, can trigger gastrulation in a Myo-II dependent mechanotransductive process. Gastrulation in turn induces endomesoderm first biochemical specification through the mechanical activation of the {beta}cat pathway in pre-bilaterian Nematostella vectensis, like in Drosophila and zebrafish embryos, which common ancestor dates back to 600-700 million years ago.\n\nThese observations converge to animal emergence that has been mechanotransductively triggered by wavelet mechanical strains on the sea-shore in multicellular choanoflagellates through Myo-II more than 700 million years ago, a process achieved in first metazoan through mechanosensitive Y654-containing {beta}cat evolutionary emergence found as conserved in all metazoan.\n\nOne sentence summaryMarine hydrodynamic strains have activated first gastric organ formation from ancestral pre-animal cell colonies.",

    "abstract": "Methods for data analysis in the biomedical, life and social sciences are developing at a rapid pace. At the same time, there is increasing concern that education in quantitative methods is failing to adequately prepare students for contemporary research. These trends have led to calls for educational reform to undergraduate and graduate quantitative research method curricula. We argue that such reform should be based on data-driven insights into within- and cross-disciplinary use of research methods. Our survey of peer-reviewed literature screened [~]3.5 million openly available research articles to monitor the cross-disciplinary usage of research methods in the past decade. We applied data-driven text-mining analyses to the methods and materials section of a large subset of this corpus to identify method trends shared across disciplines, as well as those unique to each discipline. As a whole, usage of T-test, analysis of variance, and other classical regression-based methods has declined in the published literature over the past 10 years. Machine-learning approaches, such as artificial neural networks, have seen a significant increase in the total share of scientific publications. We find unique groupings of research methods associated with each biomedical, life and social science discipline, such as the use of structural equation modeling in psychology, survival models in oncology, and manifold learning in ecology. We discuss the implications of these findings for education in statistics and research methods, as well as within- and cross-disciplinary collaboration.",

    "abstract": "Efforts to advance translation through pre-clinical behavioural and pharmacological tests prompted attention to rat strain differences. Particularly the use of touchscreen technology for cognitive testing initiated the widespread use of Lister Hooded and Long Evans rats and they differed in pharmacological sensitivity to certain drugs. One possible reason for this rat strain difference could be that Long Evans rats produce high-amplitude spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in their cortical EEG recordings, while no information available about Lister Hooded rats in this regard. As a serendipitous observation, we noticed the presence of SWDs during the EEG recordings of Lister Hooded rats. In this study, therefore, we examined these spontaneous SWDs in two groups of Lister Hooded rats. The number and sum duration of the SWDs were similar to that was observed in other rat strains. We found SWDs during wakefulness, slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, their duration was the longest during wakefulness, but their number and sum duration were also high during REM. The GABA-B receptor agonist baclofen exacerbated, while the GABA-B antagonist SCH50911 reduced the occurrence of the recorded SWDs. Typical anti-seizure medications, valproate and diazepam, decreased the number and sum duration of SWDs. Although the two rat strains typically used in touchscreen experiments are similar in term of SWDs, the occurrence and possible pharmacological modulation of SWDs are considerable during their use in behavioural experiments.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus cereus group (Bacillus cereus sensu lato) has a diverse ecology, including various species that are vertebrate or invertebrate pathogens. Few isolates from the B. cereus group have however been demonstrated to benefit plant growth. Therefore, it is crucial to explore how bacterial development and toxicity evolves during plant colonization. Herein, we investigated Bacillus thuringiensis (Cry-) adaptation to the colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots, and monitored changes in cellular differentiation in experimentally evolved isolates. Isolates from two populations displayed improved iterative ecesis on roots and increased toxicity against insect larvae. Molecular dissection and recreation of a causative mutation revealed the importance of a non-sense mutation in the rho transcription terminator gene. Transcriptome analysis revealed how Rho impacts various B. thuringiensis genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and virulence. Our work suggests that evolved multicellular aggregates have a fitness advantage over single cells when colonizing plants, creating a trade-off between swimming and multicellularity in evolved lineages, in addition to unrelated alterations in pathogenicity.\n\nImportanceBiologicals-based plant protection relies on the use of safe microbial strains. During application of biologicals to the rhizosphere, microbes adapt to the niche, including genetic mutations shaping the physiology of the cells. Here, the experimental evolution of Bacillus thuringiensis lacking the insecticide crystal toxins was examined on the plant root to reveal how adaptation shapes the differentiation of this bacterium. Interestingly, evolution of certain linages led to increased emetic toxin production, hemolysis and insect larvae pathogenesis in B. thuringiensis driven by transcriptional rewiring. Further, our detailed study reveals how inactivation of the transcription termination protein Rho promotes aggregation on the plant root in addition to altered differentiation and pathogenesis in B. thuringiensis.",

    "abstract": "Inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) is an assembly cofactor for HIV-1. We report here that IP6 is also used for assembly of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), a retrovirus from a different genus. IP6 was [~]100-fold more potent at promoting RSV mature CA assembly than observed for HIV-1 and removal of IP6 in vivo reduced infectivity by 100-fold. By cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging, mature virus-like particles (VLPs) showed an IP6-like density in the CA hexamer, coordinated by rings of six lysines and six arginines. Phosphate and IP6 had opposing effects on CA in vitro assembly, inducing formation of T=1 icosahedrons and tubes, respectively, implying that phosphate promotes pentamer and IP6 hexamer formation. Subtomogram averaging and classification optimized for analysis of pleomorphic retrovirus particles revealed that the heterogeneity of mature RSV CA polyhedrons results from an unexpected, intrinsic CA hexamer flexibility. In contrast, the CA pentamer forms rigid units organizing the local architecture. These different features of hexamers and pentamers determine the structural mechanism to form CA polyhedrons of variable shape in mature RSV particles.",

However, the drivers of microdiversification remain largely unknown. Here we show that selection promotes microdiversity in the microbiome associated with sediments in glacier-fed streams (GFS). Applying a novel phylogenetic framework, we identify several clades that are under homogeneous selection and that contain genera with higher levels of microdiversity than the rest of the genera. Overall these clades constituted [~]44% and [~]64% of community -diversity and abundance, and both percentages increased further in GFS that were largely devoid of primary producers. Our findings show that strong homogeneous selection drives the microdiversification of specialized microbial groups putatively underlying their success in the extreme environment of GFS. This microdiversity could be threatened as glaciers shrink, with unknown consequences for microbial diversity and functionality in these ecosystems.",

With the adult data, we demonstrate the capacity of MASiVar to simultaneously quantify the intrasession, intersession, interscanner, and intersubject variability of four common DWI processing approaches: (1) a tensor signal representation, (2) a multi-compartment neurite orientation dispersion and density model, (3) white matter bundle segmentation, and (4) structural connectomics. Respectively, we evaluate region-wise fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity, and principal eigenvector; region-wise cerebral spinal fluid volume fraction, intracellular volume fraction, and orientation dispersion index; bundle-wise shape, volume, FA, and length; and whole connectome correlation and maximized modularity, global efficiency, and characteristic path length.\n\nResultsWe plot the variability in these measures at each level and find that it consistently increases with intrasession to intersession to interscanner to intersubject effects across all processing approaches and that sometimes interscanner variability can approach intersubject variability.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates the potential of MASiVar to more globally investigate DWI variability across multiple levels and processing approaches simultaneously and suggests harmonization between scanners for multisite analyses should be considered prior to inference of group differences on subjects.",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer, leading to aneuploid cells. To study the role that CIN plays in tumor evolution, several mouse models have been engineered over the last two decades. These studies have unequivocally shown that systemic high-grade CIN is embryonic lethal. We and others have previously shown that embryonic lethality can be circumvented by provoking CIN in a tissue-specific fashion. In this study, we provoke systemic high-grade CIN in adult mice as an alternative to circumvent embryonic lethality. For this, we disrupt the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) by alleviating Mad2 or truncating Mps1, both essential genes for SAC functioning, with or without p53 inactivation. We find that disruption of the SAC leads to rapid villous atrophy, atypia and apoptosis of intestinal epithelia, substantial weight loss, and death within 10 days after the start of the CIN insult. Despite this severe intestinal phenotype, most other tissues are unaffected, except for minor abnormalities in spleen, presumably due to the low proliferation rate in these tissues. We conclude that high-grade CIN in vivo in adult mice is most toxic to intestinal epithelia, presumably due to the high cell turnover in this tissue.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a human herpes virus, encodes 44 microRNAs (miRNAs), which regulate many genes with various functions in EBV-infected cells. Multiple target genes of the EBV miRNAs have been identified, some of which play important roles in adaptive antiviral immune responses. Using EBV mutant derivatives, we identified additional roles of viral miRNAs in governing versatile type I interferon (IFN) responses upon infection of human primary mature B cells. We also found that Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) and LF2, viral genes with previously reported functions in inducing or regulating IFN-I pathways, had negligible or even contrary effects on secreted IFN- in our model. Data mining and Ago PAR-CLIP experiments uncovered more than a dozen of previously uncharacterized, direct cellular targets of EBV miRNA associated with type I IFN pathways. We also identified indirect targets of EBV miRNAs in B cells, such as TRL7 and TLR9, in the pre-latent phase of infection. The presence of epigenetically naive, non-CpG methylated viral DNA was essential to induce IFN- secretion during EBV infection in a TLR9-dependent manner. In a newly established fusion assay, we verified that EBV virions enter a subset of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) and determined that these infected pDCs are the primary producers of IFN- in EBV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Our findings document that many EBV-encoded miRNAs regulate type I IFN response in newly EBV infected primary human B cells in the pre-latent phase of infection and dampen the acute release of IFN- in pDCs upon their encounter with EBV.\n\nAuthor summaryAcute antiviral functions of all nucleated cells rely on type I interferon (IFN-I) pathways triggered upon viral infection. Host responses encompass the sensing of incoming viruses, the activation of specific transcription factors which induce transcription of IFN-I genes, the secretion of different IFN-I types and their recognition by the heterodimeric IFN-/{beta} receptor, the subsequent activation of JAK/STAT signaling pathways and, finally, the transcription of many IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). In sum, these cellular functions establish a so-called antiviral state in infected and neighboring cells. To counteract these cellular defense mechanisms, viruses have evolved diverse strategies and encode gene products that target antiviral responses. Among such immune evasive factors are viral microRNAs (miRNAs) that can interfere with host gene expression. We discovered that multiple miRNAs encoded by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) control over a dozen cellular genes that contribute to the anti-viral states of immune cells, specifically B cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). We identified the viral DNA genome as the activator of IFN- and question the role of abundant EBV EBERs, that, contrary to previous reports, do not have an apparent inducing function in the IFN-I pathway early after infection.",

    "abstract": "Agricultural production systems, subjects of study in agroecology, are non-equilibrium open systems permanently influenced by the action of natural or anthropogenic disturbances or \"ripple effects.\" Faced with this situation, agroecosystems tend to maintain a state of functional equilibrium in time and space, through an emergent property known as resilience. This concept is related to the dissipative capacity of agroecosystems to interact with the disturbance in such a way as to allow it to preserve its functionality and basic structure, through attenuation of the effect that disturbs the system. The literature reports diverse methods with a variable number of indicators or criteria for the evaluation or analysis of resilience. Many of these present conceptual deficiencies considering that the components of the system have similar characteristics and linear responses, that is, they do not show changes due to the action or nature of the disturbance. In this sense, there is a need to propose a generic method to analyze and evaluate agroecosystemic resilience, through a complex and comprehensive approach that takes into consideration the interaction of physical, biotic, socioeconomic or symbolic components of the system. These interactions are differential (weighted), to facilitate decision-making by the community, farmers, or administrators, regarding adaptations, adjustments or modifications that allow the agroecosystem to maintain its productivity and permanence.",

    "abstract": "Maternal-offspring communication and care are essential for offspring survival. Oxytocin (OXT) is known for its role in initiation of maternal care, but whether OXT can rapidly influence maternal behavior or ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs; above 50 kHz) has not been examined. To test for rapid effects of OXT, California mouse mothers were administered an acute intranasal (IN) dose of OXT (0.8 IU/kg) followed by a separation test with three phases: habituation with pups in a new testing chamber, separation via a wire mesh, and finally reunion with pups. We measured maternal care, maternal USVs, and pup USVs. In mothers, we primarily observed simple sweep USVs, a short downward sweeping call around 50 kHz, and in pups we only observed pup whines, a long call with multiple harmonics ranging from 20 kHz to 50 kHz. We found that IN OXT rapidly and selectively enhanced the normal increase in maternal simple sweep USVs when mothers had physical access to pups (habituation and reunion), but not when mothers were physically separated from pups. Maternal-pup USVs were correlated upon reunion, but IN OXT did not influence this correlation. Finally, mothers given IN OXT showed a more positive change in retrievals/carrying and greater total maternal care upon reunion. Behavioral changes were specific to maternal behaviors (e.g. retrievals) as mothers given IN OXT did not differ from controls in stress-related behaviors (e.g. freezing). Overall, these findings highlight the rapid effects and context-dependent effect a single dose of IN OXT has on both maternal USV production and offspring care.",

At pH [&le;] 8, phosphohistidine is unstable compared to the extensively studied phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine. This study reports the absolute quantitative analysis of histidine phosphorylation of proteins from a human bronchial epithelial cell (16HBE14o-) lysate using 31P NMR spectroscopic analysis. The method was designed to minimize loss of the phosphohistidine phosphoryl group. Phosphohistidine was determined on average to be approximately one third as abundant as phosphoserine and phosphothreonine combined (and thus roughly 20 times more abundant than phosphotyrosine). The amount of phosphohistidine, and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine per gram of protein from a cell lysate was determined to be 23 mol/g and 68 mol/g respectively. The amount of phosphohistidine, and phosphoserine/phosphothreonine per cell was determined to be 1.8 fmol/cell, and 5.8 fmol/cell respectively. After tryptic digest of proteins from the16HBE14o- cell lysate, the phosphohistidine signal was abolished and increasing phosphoserine/phosphothreonine signal was observed, which has implications for mass spectrometry investigations. The 31P NMR spectroscopic analysis not only highlights the abundance of phosphohistidine, which likely reflects its importance in mammalian cells, but also provides a way of measuring and comparing levels of phosphorylated amino acids in cells.",

    "abstract": "Garlic is one of the most crucial Allium vegetables used as seasoning of foods. It has a lot of benefits from the medicinal and nutritional point of view; however, its production is highly constrained by both biotic and abiotic challenges. Among these, viral infections are the most prevalent factors affecting crop productivity around the globe. This experiment was conducted on eleven selected garlic accessions and three improved varieties collected from different garlic growing agro-climatic regions of Ethiopia. This study aimed to identify and characterize the isolated garlic virus using the coat protein (CP) gene and further determine their phylogenetic relatedness. RNA was extracted from fresh young leaves, thirteen days old seedlings, which showed yellowing, mosaic, and stunting symptoms. Pairwise molecular diversity for CP nucleotide and amino acid sequences were calculated using MEGA5. Maximum Likelihood tree of CP nucleotide sequence data of Allexivirus and Potyvirus were conducted using PhyML, while a neighbor-joining tree was constructed for the amino acid sequence data using MEGA5. From the result, five garlic viruses were identified viz. Garlic virus C (78.6 %), Garlic virus D (64.3 %), Garlic virus X (78.6 %), Onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV) (100%), and Leek yellow stripe virus (LYSV) (78.6 %). The study revealed the presence of complex mixtures of viruses with 42.9 % of the samples had co-infected with a species complex of Garlic virus C, Garlic virus D, Garlic virus X, OYDV, and LYSV. Pairwise comparisons of the isolated Potyviruses and Allexiviruses species revealed high identity with that of the known members of their respected species. As an exception, less within species identity was observed among Garlic virus C isolates as compared with that of the known members of the species. Finally, our results highlighted the need for stepping up a working framework to establish virus-free garlic planting material exchange in the country which could result in the reduction of viral gene flow across the country.\n\nAuthor SummaryGarlic viruses are the most devastating disease since garlic is the most vulnerable crop due to their vegetative nature of propagation. Currently, the garlic viruses are the aforementioned production constraint in Ethiopia. However, so far very little is known on the identification, diversity, and dissemination of garlic infecting viruses in the country. Here we explore the prevalence, genetic diversity, and the presence of mixed infection of garlic viruses in Ethiopia using next generation sequencing platform. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences of coat protein genes from infected samples revealed the association of three species from Allexivirus and two species from Potyvirus in a complex mixture. Ultimately the article concludes there is high time to set up a working framework to establish garlic free planting material exchange platform which could result in a reduction of viral gene flow across the country.",

    "abstract": "Genome-scale metabolic modeling is an important tool in understanding metabolism, by enhancing collation of knowledge, interpretation of data, and prediction of metabolic capabilities. A central assumption in the construction and use of genome-scale models is that the in vivo organism is evolved for optimal growth, where growth is represented by flux through a biomass objective function (BOF). While the specific composition of the BOF is crucial, its formulation is often inherited from similar organisms due to the experimental challenges associated with its proper determination.\n\nHowever, a cells macro-molecular composition is not fixed and it responds to changes in environmental conditions. As a consequence, initiatives for the high-fidelity determination of cellular biomass composition have been launched. Thus, there is a need for a mathematical and computational framework capable of using multiple measurements of cellular biomass composition in different environments. Here, we propose two different computational approaches for directly addressing this challenge: Biomass Trade-off Weighting (BTW) and Higher-dimensional-plane InterPolation (HIP).\n\nIn lieu of experimental data on biomass composition-variation in response to changing nutrient environment, we assess the properties of BTW and HIP using three hypothetical, yet biologically plausible, BOFs for the Escherichia coli genome-scale metabolic model iML1515. We find that the BTW and HIP formulations have a significant impact on model performance and phenotypes. Furthermore, the BTW method generates larger growth rates in all environments when compared to HIP. Using acetate secretion and the respiratory quotient as proxies for phenotypic changes, we find marked differences between the methods as HIP generates BOFs more similar to a reference BOF than BTW. We conclude that the presented methods constitute a first conceptual step in developing genome-scale metabolic modelling approaches capable of addressing the inherent dependence of cellular biomass composition on nutrient environments.\n\nAuthor summaryChanges in the environment promote changes in an organisms metabolism. To achieve balanced growth states for near-optimal function, cells respond through metabolic rearrangements, which may influence the biosynthesis of metabolic precursors for building a cells molecular constituents. Therefore, it is necessary to take the dependence of biomass composition on environmental conditions into consideration. While measuring the biomass composition for some environments is possible, and should be done, it cannot be completed for all possible environments.\n\nIn this work, we propose two main approaches, BTW and HIP, for addressing the challenge of estimating biomass composition in response to environmental changes. We evaluate the phenotypic consequences of BTW and HIP by characterizing their effect on growth, secretion potential, respiratory efficiency, and gene essentiality of a cell.\n\nOur work constitutes a first conceptual step in accounting for the influence of growth conditions on biomass composition, and in turn the biomass compositions effect on metabolic phenotypic traits, within constraint-based modelling. As such, we believe it will improve the relevance of constraint-based methods in metabolic engineering and drug discovery, since the biosynthetic potential of microbes for generating industrially relevant products or drugs often is closely linked to their biomass composition.",

Furthermore, the acquisition of auditory fear memory is impaired after infusion of a drug into auditory cortex which blocks chromatin reorganization in vitro.

    "abstract": "A panel of 4 different cell lines was optimized for isolation, identification, and authentication of a VZV virus from a swab sample of an 8-year-old boy suspected to varicella zoster infection. The system enabled highly efficient and rapid isolation of viruses in 33{degrees}C by serial sub culturing to more than 25 passages. The technique relies on isolation of viral genes by increasing the number of particles that are statistically represented in cell culture and verified by CCID50, FAM-RT-PCR, and IE62 antibody in IF test. The viral genes (ORF38, ORF54) confirmed the new isolate as VZV and revealed the amino acid sequence of viral-encoded proteins after 27 passages, identical with positive control virus, in RFLP-PCR test. Utilization of successive serial passages at temperatures lower than the normal body temperature would reduce the virus virulence and directly cause virus attenuation. As a result, the attenuated virus is adapted to growth in vitro and presented higher replication at 33{degrees}C. Our goal was to determine if the targeted virus with a large double-stranded DNA genome, varicella virus, is isolated and can be attenuated by cold adapting in vitro, Using vOka as attenuated VZV golden standard, in two quantitative tests, including CCID50 and FAM-RT-PCR. Finally, when compared with the local isolated virus, these results were strongly confirmed. We recorded plaque forming assay to show phenotypic changing which encodes the attenuation regarding size of plaque. Although in plaque forming assay, the size of plaque seemed smaller at first glance, the statistical distribution of the plaque size did not show any change between the virus in the first and last passages. In cell culture, the local VZV isolated viruses formed clear plaques and grew to higher titers compared with lower passages as parental virus.Due to lack of access to human fetal lung cells (MRC-5) and an alternative to vaccine production in the future, a new authenticated local foreskin cell substrate (RFSC) was used for virus cultivation. In comparison to, MRC-5-optimized and cloned-viruses replicated in vitro with kinetics that were similar to those of the RFSC. Laboratory animals that were infected with the optimized virus fluid as vaccine showed a good neutralization antibody against local VZV isolated as compared to vOka as control positive virus. These results demonstrate that the virus isolated from swab sample was authenticated as VZV virus, and this cold adapted attenuated virus may be an applicable candidate for future plan.\n\nAuthor summaryWe used different cell substrates for isolation, identification, and attenuation of a new local VZV virus from vesicle swab of suspected patient to varicella zoster diseases.

Our goal was to determine if the targeted virus with a large double-stranded DNA genome, varicella virus, is isolated and can be attenuated by cold adapting in vitro, using vOka as attenuated VZV golden standard, The virus was cloned and purified by serial dilution cloning and plaque assay. Different techniques were used regarding verification as differentiation from other members in family, potency, and sterility for isolated virus. The virus can grow well in new local foreskin cell substrate and produce good titre as compared with MRC-5. The isolated VZV potentially induced neutralization antibody in animal model. The results of our study imply that local VZV might be an applicable isolate for future plan in research and developing a varicella vaccine.",

    "abstract": "The ascomycete, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, has a broad host range and causes yield loss in dicotyledonous crops world wide. Genomic diversity and aggressiveness were determined in a population of 127 isolates from individual canola (Brassica napus) fields in western Canada. Genotyping with 39 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers revealed each isolate was an unique haplotype. Analysis of molecular variation showed 97% was due to isolate and 3% to geographical location. Testing of mycelium compatibility identified clones of mutually compatible isolates, and stings of pairwise compatible isolates not seen before. Importantly, mutually compatible isolates had similar SSR haplotype, in contrast to high diversity among incompatible isolates. Isolates from the Province of Manitoba had higher allelic richness and higher mycelium compatibility (61%) than Alberta (35%) and Saskatchewan (39%). All compatible Manitoba isolates were interconnected in clones and strings, which can be explained by wetter growing seasons and more susceptible crops species both favouring more mycelium interaction and life cycles. Analysis of linkage disequilibrium rejected random recombination, consistent with a self-fertile fungus and restricted outcrossing due to mycelium incompatibility, and only one meiosis per lifecycle. More probable sources of genomic diversity is slippage during DNA replication and point mutation affecting single nucleotides, not withstanding the high mutation rate of SSRs compared to genes. It seems accumulation of these polymorphisms lead to increasing mycelium incompatibility in a population over time. A phylogenetic tree grouped isolates into 17 sub-populations. Aggressiveness was tested by inoculating one isolate from each sub-population onto B. napus lines with quantitative resistance. Results were significant for isolate, line, and isolate by line interaction. These isolates represent the genomic and pathogenic diversity in western Canada, and are suitable for resistance screening in canola breeding programs. Since the S. sclerotiorum life cycle is universal, conclusions on sources of genomic diversity extrapolates to populations in other geographical areas and host crops.\n\nAuthor summarySclerotinia sclerotiorum populations from various plant species and geographical areas have been studied extensively using mycelium compatibility tests and genotyping with a shared set of 6-13 SSR markers published in 2001. Most conclude the pathogen is clonally propagated with some degree of outcrossing. In the present study, a population of S. sclerotiorum isolates from 1.5 million km2 area in western Canada were tested for mycelium compatibility, and genotyped with 9 published and 30 newly developed SSR markers targeting all chromosomes in the dikaryot genome (8+8). A new way of visualizing mycelium compatibility results revealed clones of mutual compatible isolates, as well as long and short strings of pairwise compatible isolates. Importantly, clonal isolates had similar SSR haplotype, while incompatible isolates were highly dissimilar; a relationship difficult to discern previously. Analysis of population structure found a lack of linkage disequilibrium ruling out random recombination. Outcrossing, a result of alignment of non-sister chromosomes during meiosis, is unlikely in S. sclerotiorum, since mycelium incompatibility prevents karyogamy, and compatibility only occur between isolates with similar genomic composition. Instead, genomic diversity comprise transfer of nuclei through hyphal anastomosis, allelic modifications during cell division and point mutation. Genomic polymorphisms accumulate over time likely result in gradual divergence of individuals, which seems to resemble the  ring-species concept. We are currently studying whether nuclei in microconidia might also contribute to diversity. A phylogenetic analysis grouped isolates into 17 sub-populations. One isolate from each sub-population showed different level of aggressiveness when inoculated onto B. napus lines previously determined to have quantitative resistance to a single isolate. Seed of these lines and S. sclerotiorum isolates have been transferred to plant breeders, and can be requested from the corresponding author for breeding purposes. Quantitative resistance is likely to hold up over time, since the rate of genomic change is relatively slow in S. sclerotiorum.",

    "abstract": "Although interactions with alveolar macrophages have been well characterized for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the roles epithelial cells play during infection and disease development have been less studied. We have previously shown that deletion of gene rv3351c reduces M. tuberculosis replication in and necrosis of A549 human type II pneumocyte cells. In the present study, we report that rv3351c is required for lipid raft aggregation on A549 cell plasma membranes during M. tuberculosis infection. Lipid raft aggregation was also induced directly by recombinant Rv3351c protein. A{Delta} rv3351c deletion mutant was less effective than wild type M. tuberculosis at circumventing phagolysosome fusion in A549 cells as evidenced by increased co-localization with lysosomal markers LAMP-2 and cathepsin-L by the mutant bacilli. These observations indicate a role for Rv3351c in modification of the plasma membrane to facilitate trafficking and survival of M. tuberculosis bacilli through alveolar epithelial cells, and support the hypothesis that M. tuberculosis has mechanisms to target the alveolar epithelium. Preliminary data also demonstrate that like the type II pneumocyte-targeting M. tuberculosis secreted protein heparin-binding filamentous hemagglutinin (HBHA), Rv3351c is detected by the host cellular and humoral immune responses during infection, and may play an important role in mycobacterial dissemination from the lungs.\n\nAuthor summaryMycobacterium tuberculosis is the leading causes of death due to a single infectious agent and many facets regarding the pathogenesis of this organism remain unknown. This facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen often establishes infection through inhalation of the bacilli into the alveoli of the lungs. Interactions with alveolar macrophages have been well characterized and it had been assumed that these interactions with phagocytic cells primarily determine the fate of the disease. However, alveolar epithelial cells, such as type II pneumocytes, play important roles in disease progression of other bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens, which provided the impetus to more-closely examine pneumocyte-M. tuberculosis interactions. We describe in this study the role of the M. tuberculosis rv3351c gene product in the internalization and survival of this pathogen in human type II pneumocytes. We previously showed that a{Delta} rv3351c mutant replicates less efficiently and generates less necrosis than the parental M. tuberculosis strain in this cell type. We demonstrate herein that Rv3351c protein induces lipid raft aggregation on the membranes of alveolar epithelial cells and that M. tuberculosis {Delta}rv3351c traffics through LAMP-2-labeled endosomes 30% more frequently than the parent strain. This trafficking toward phagolysosomes may underlie the reduced replication and cytotoxicity of the mutant. The role of Rv3351c in trafficking and survival of M. tuberculosis bacilli through epithelial cells ultimately resulting in dissemination from the lungs may begin with modifications to the plasma membrane prior to attachment. Such a mechanism of activity suggests Rv3351c as a potential vaccine target to train the host immune system to bind and eliminate the protein before it modulates the alveolar epithelium.",

    "abstract": "EBV latent infection in gastric carcinoma (GC) cells is characterized by distinct viral gene expression programs. CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a chromatin structural factor that has been involved in coordinated chromatin interactions between multiple loci of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genes. Here, we investigate the role of CTCF in regulating EBV gene expression and chromosome conformation in model of EBV-associated gastric carcinoma (EBVaGC). Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) against CTCF revealed 16 CTCF binding sites (BS) in EBV genome of EBVaGC, SNU719 cells. Among the CTCF BSs, one site named as BARTp (BamHI A right transcript promoter) CTCF BS is located at upstream of 11.8-kb BART region (EBV genome: 139724-151554) and was not yet defined its biological functions in EBV life cycle. EBV BART encodes a complex miRNA cluster of highly spliced transcripts that is implicated in EBV cancer pathogenesis. This present study investigated the functional role of the CTCF binding site at BARTp (BARTp CTCF BS) in regulating EBV gene transcription and EBV three-dimensional (3D) genome structure as DNA loop maker. Circular chromatin confirmation capture (4C)-seq and chromatin confirmation capture (3C)-semi-quantitative(sq)PCR assays using SNU719 cells revealed that BARTp CTCF BS interacts with CTCF BSs of LMP1/2, Cp/OriP, and Qp in EBV genome. We generated mutations in BARTp CTCF BS (S13) in bacmids with (BART+) or without (BART-) the 11.8-kb BART transcript unit (B(+/-)). ChIP-qPCR assay demonstrated that CTCF binding was ablated from BARTp in EBV B(+/-) S13- genomes (mutant S13), elevated at several other sites such as LMP1, OriP, and Cp in EBV B(-) (BART-) S13- genome, and decreased at the same sites in EBV B(+) S13- genome. Infection assay showed that BARTp CTCF BS mutation reduced infectivity, while BART transcript deletion has no detectable effects. Gene expression tests showed that EBNA1 was highly downregulated in B(+/-) S13- EBVs related to B(+/-) S13+ EBVs (wild-type S13). LMP1 and BZLF1 were more downregulated in B(-) S13- EBV than B(+) S13- EBV. Taken together, these findings suggest that the CTCF binding and BART region contribute to EBV 3D genome structure via a cluster of DNA loops formed by BARTp CTCF BS (S13) and are important for coordinated viral gene expression and EBV infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Repeated counts of animal abundance can reveal changes in local ecosystem health and inform conservation strategies. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) such as drones are commonly used to photograph animals in remote locations; however, counting animals in images is a laborious task. Crowd-sourcing can reduce the time required to conduct these censuses considerably, but must first be validated against expert counts to measure sources of error. Our objectives were to assess the accuracy and precision of citizen science counts and make recommendations for future citizen science projects. We uploaded drone imagery from Ano Nuevo Island (California, USA) to a curated Zooniverse website that instructed citizen scientists to count seals and sea lions. Across 212 days, over 1,500 volunteers counted animals in 90,000 photographs. We quantified the error associated with several descriptive statistics to extract a single citizen science count per photograph from the 15 repeat counts and then compared the resulting citizen science counts to expert counts. Although proportional error was relatively low (9% for sea lions and 5% for seals during the breeding seasons) and improved with repeat sampling, the 12+ volunteers required to reduce error was prohibitively slow, taking on average 6 weeks to estimate animals from a single drone flight covering 25 acres, despite strong public outreach efforts. The single best algorithm was  Median without the lowest two values, demonstrating that citizen scientists tended to under-estimate the number of animals present. Citizen scientists accurately counted adult seals, but accuracy was lower when sea lions were present during the summer and could be confused for seals. We underscore the importance of validation efforts and careful project design for researchers hoping to combine citizen science with drone imagery.",

    "abstract": "Feral pigs predate on freshwater turtles and damage wetland habitats in the process. Installing fences successfully averts access and damage, however, they become a barrier for freshwater turtles requiring land access during migration. We collected 161 turtles (Chelodina rugosa, Emydura subglobosa worrelli, Myuchelys latisternum) from twenty floodplain and riverine wetlands during post-wet (June-August) and late-dry season (November-December) surveys (2015-2018) in northern Australia. Wetlands were either fenced (150 x 150mm square, 1.05m high wire mesh) or not around the wet perimeter. Nine-seven percent of individuals caught in either fenced or unfenced wetlands had a shell carapace width greater than mesh width, of these 44 (46%) were captured inside fenced wetlands, while 50 were caught in unfenced wetlands. The remaining 35 were smaller than 150mm and would easily pass through fence mesh. Sixty-five turtles partook in a fencing manipulative experiment. Turtles with carapace widths wider than mesh often successfully escaped through fences by lifting one side of their shell and passing diagonally. In a second experiment where a piece of vertical wire (1500mmx300mm) was removed, turtles located gates after prospecting and trying to fit through meshing areas that were too small to pass through. Nine-two percent of turtles were able to locate and pass through gates, while 8% failed to locate a gate after 2 hours. Three turtles that did not use gates, and seemed to  give up and dug into the grass. Gates applied every 4m showed an 83% passage rate, every 2m was 91%, and while every 1m was 100%. Combing field and manipulative experiments revealed that large turtles will prospect and move along a fence until they find suitable passage. Applying turtle gates every 1-4m allows almost 100% passage, and if strategically applied in travel corridors, would minimize the need for large-scale clipping efforts around entire wetlands.",

Fossil calibrations as old as Triassic were adopted after Moulds (2018), and a Quaternary geological event calibration was adopted following Osozawa et al. (2012), applying the calibration function of BEAST. Our timetree suggests that Tettigarctidae had cicada basal lineage as old as 200 Ma, and Derotettiginae was next as old as 100 Ma. Tibicininae was a sister of the resting Cicadidae, and Tettigomyiinae, Cicadettinae, and Cicadina started simultaneous branching and radiation around 40 Ma. We made a base substitution rate vs age diagram based on the timetree using the BEAST function, and it strongly suggested an exponential increase of base substitution rate approaching the present. The consequent increased cicada biodiversity including generation of cryptic species might have been driven by the generation and spreading of C4 grasses and the following Quaternary glaciations and severe environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacological inhibition of PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) is an established therapeutic option to treat hypercholesterolemia and plasma PCSK9 levels have been implicated in cardiovascular disease incidence. A number of genetic variants within the PCSK9 gene locus have been shown to modulate PCSK9 levels, but these only explain a very small percentage of the overall PCSK9 interindividual variation. Here we present data on the genetic association structure between PCSK9 levels and genome-wide genetic variation in a healthy sample from the general population.\n\nWe performed a genome-wide association study of plasma PCSK9 levels in a sample of Brazilian individuals enrolled in the ELSA-Brasil cohort (n=810). Enrolled individuals were free from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and were not under lipid-lowering medication. Genome-wide genotyping was conducted using the Axiom_PMRA.r3 array and imputation used the TOPMED multi-ancestry sample panel. Total PCSK9 plasma concentrations were determined using the Quantikine SPC900 ELISA kit.\n\nWe observed two genome-wide significant loci and seven loci that reached the pre-defined p value threshold of 1 x 10-6. Significant variants were near KCNA5 and KCNA1, and LINC00353. Genetic variation at the PCSK9 locus was able to explain approximately 4% of the overall interindividual variation in PCSK9 levels. Colocalization analysis using eQTL data suggested RWDD3, ATXN7L1, KCNA1, and FAM177A1 to be potential mediators of some of the observed associations.\n\nOur results suggest that PCSK9 levels may be modulated by trans genetic variation outside of the PCSK9 gene and this may have clinical implications. Understanding both environmental and genetic predictors of PCSK9 levels may help identifying new targets for cardiovascular disease treatment and contribute to a better assessment of the benefits of long-term PCSK9 inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Confocal microscopes can reject out-of-focus and scattered light; however, widefield microscopes are far more common in biological laboratories due to their accessibility and lower cost. We report confocal imaging capacity on a widefield microscope by adding a spatial light modulator (SLM) and utilizing custom illumination and acquisition methods. We discuss our illumination strategy and compare several procedures for postprocessing the acquired image data. We assessed the performance of this system for rejecting out-of-focus light by comparing images taken using our widefield microscope, our SLM-enhanced setup, and a commercial confocal microscope. The optical sectioning capability, assessed on thin fluorescent film, was 0.85 {+/-} 0.04 m for our SLM-enhanced setup and 0.68 {+/-} 0.04 m for a confocal microscope, while a widefield microscope exhibited no sectioning capability. We demonstrate our setup by imaging the same set of neurons in C. elegans on widefield, SLM, and confocal microscopes. SLM enhancement greatly reduces background from the cell body, allowing visualization of dim fibers nearby. Our SLM-enhanced setup identified 93% of the dim neuronal fibers seen in confocal images while a widefield microscope only identified 48% of the same fibers. Our microscope add-on represents a very simple (2-component) and inexpensive (<$600) approach to enable widefield microscopes to optically section thick samples.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a virus that is continuously evolving. Although its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase exhibits some exonuclease proofreading activity, viral sequence diversity can be produced by replication errors and host factors. A diversity of genetic variants can be observed in the intra-host viral population structure of infected individuals. Most mutations will follow a neutral molecular evolution and wont make significant contributions to variations within and between infected hosts. Herein, we profiled the intra-sample genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 variants using high-throughput sequencing datasets from 15,289 infected individuals and infected cell lines. Most of the genetic variations observed, including C->U and G->U, were consistent with errors due to heat-induced DNA damage during sample processing and/or sequencing protocols. Despite high mutational background, we identified recurrent intra-variable positions in the samples analyzed, including several positions at the end of the gene encoding the viral Spike (S) protein. Strikingly, we observed a high-frequency C->A missense mutations resulting in the S protein lacking the last 20 amino acids (S{Delta}20). We found that this truncated S protein undergoes increased processing and increased syncytia formation, presumably due to escaping M protein retention in intracellular compartments. Our findings suggest the emergence of a high-frequency viral sublineage that is not horizontally transmitted but potentially involved in intra-host disease cytopathic effects.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe mutation rate and evolution of RNA viruses correlate with viral adaptation. While most mutations do not have significant contributions to viral molecular evolution, some are naturally selected and cause a genetic drift through positive selection. Many recent SARS-CoV-2 variants have been recently described and show phenotypic selection towards more infectious viruses. Our study describes another type of variant that does not contribute to inter-host heterogeneity but rather phenotypic selection toward variants that might have increased cytopathic effects. We identified that a C-terminal truncation of the Spike protein removes an important ER-retention signal, which consequently results in a Spike variant that easily travels through the Golgi toward the plasma membrane in a pre-activated conformation, leading to increased syncytia formation.",

    "abstract": "Binding of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) to nasal mucus leads to entrapment and clearance via mucociliary activity during colonization. To identify Spn factors allowing for evasion of mucus binding, we used a solid-phase adherence assay with immobilized mucus of human and murine origin. Spn bound large mucus particles through interactions with carbohydrate moieties. Mutants lacking neuraminidase (nanA) or neuraminidase B (nanB) showed increased mucus binding that correlated with diminished removal of terminal sialic acid residues on bound mucus. The non-additive activity of the two enzymes raised the question why Spn expresses two neuraminidases and suggested they function in the same pathway. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated expression of nanA depends on the enzymatic function of NanB. As transcription of nanA is increased in the presence of sialic acid, our findings suggest that sialic acid liberated from host glycoconjugates by the secreted enzyme NanB induces the expression of the cell-associated enzyme NanA. The absence of detectable mucus desialylation in the nanA mutant, in which NanB is still expressed, suggests that NanA is responsible for the bulk of the modification of host glycoconjugates. Thus, our studies describe a functional role for NanB in sialic acid sensing in the host. The contribution of the neuraminidases in vivo was then assessed in a murine model of colonization. Although mucus-binding mutants showed an early advantage, this was only observed in a competitive infection, suggesting a complex role of neuraminidases. Histologic examination of the upper respiratory tract demonstrated that Spn stimulates mucus production in a neuraminidase-dependent manner. Thus, an increase production of mucus containing secretions appears to be balanced, in vivo, by decreased mucus binding. We postulate that through the combined activity of its neuraminidases, Spn evades mucus binding and mucociliary clearance, which is needed to counter neuraminidase-mediated stimulation of mucus secretions.\n\nAuthor SummaryStreptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) is a leading mucosal pathogen, whose host interaction begins with colonization of the upper respiratory tract. While there has been extensive investigation into bacterial interaction with epithelial cells, there is little understanding of bacterial-mucus interactions. Our study used mucus of human and murine origin and a murine model of colonization to study mucus associations involving Spn. The main findings reveal i) the enzymatic activity of Spns neuraminidases (NanA and NanB) contribute to mucus evasion through removing terminal sialic acid, ii) the enzymatic activity of NanB controls expression of the main neuraminidase, NanA, and iii) Spn induces sialic acid containing mucus secretions in vivo in a neuraminidase-dependent manner. We postulate that during colonization, neuraminidase-dependent reduction in mucus binding enables evasion of mucociliary clearance, which is necessary to counter neuraminidase-mediated stimulation of mucus secretions. Thus, our study provides new insights into the role of Spn neuraminidases on colonization.",
