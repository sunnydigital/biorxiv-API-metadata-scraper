    "abstract": "Human genetics have defined a new autism-associated syndrome caused by loss-of-function mutations in MYT1L, a transcription factor known for enabling fibroblast-to-neuron conversions. However, how MYT1L mutation causes autism, ADHD, intellectual disability, obesity, and brain anomalies is unknown. Here, we develop a mouse model of this syndrome. Physically, Myt1l haploinsufficiency causes obesity, white-matter thinning, and microcephaly in the mice, mimicking clinical phenotypes. During brain development we discovered disrupted gene expression, mediated in part by loss of Myt1l gene target activation, and identified precocious neuronal differentiation as the mechanism for microcephaly. In contrast, in adults we discovered that mutation results in failure of transcriptional and chromatin maturation, echoed in disruptions in baseline physiological properties of neurons. This results in behavioral anomalies including hyperactivity, muscle weakness and fatigue, and social alterations with more severe phenotypes in males. Overall, our findings provide insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of this disorder and enable future preclinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal avalanches and asynchronous irregular (AI) firing patterns have been thought to represent distinct frameworks to understand the brain spontaneous activity. The former is typically present in systems where there is a balance between the slow accumulation of tension and its fast dissipation, whereas the latter is accompanied by the balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition (E/I). Here, we develop a new theory of E/I balance that relies on two homeostatic adaptation mechanisms: the short-term depression of inhibition and the spike-dependent threshold increase. First, we turn off the adaptation and show that the so-called static system has a typical critical point commonly attributed to self-organized critical models. Then, we turn on the adaptation and show that the network evolves to a dynamic regime in which: (I) E/I synapses balance regardless of any parameter choice; (II) an AI firing pattern emerges; and (III) neuronal avalanches display power laws. This is the first time that these three phenomena appear simultaneously in the same network activity. Thus, we show that the once thought opposing frameworks may be unified into a single dynamics, provided that adaptation mechanisms are in place. In our model, the AI firing pattern is a direct consequence of the hovering close to the critical line where external inputs are compensated by threshold growth, creating synaptic balance for any E/I weight ratio.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAsynchronous irregular (AI) firing happens together with power-law neuronal avalanches under self-organized synaptic balance.\nC_LIO_LISelf-organization towards the critical and balanced state (with AI and power-law avalanches) occur via short-term inhibition depression and firing threshold adaptation.\nC_LIO_LIThe avalanche exponents match experimental findings.\nC_LIO_LIThe adaptation time scales drive the self-organized dynamics towards different firing regimes.\nC_LI\n\nAuthor summaryTwo competing frameworks are employed to understand the brain spontaneous activity, both of which are backed by computational and experimental evidence: globally asynchronous and locally irregular (AI) activity arises in excitatory/inhibitory balanced networks subjected to external stimuli, whereas avalanche activity emerge in excitable systems on the critical point between active and inactive states. Here, we develop a new theory for E/I networks and show that there is a state where synaptic balance coexists with AI firing and power-law distributed neuronal avalanches. This regime is achieved through the introducing of short-term depression of inhibitory synapses and spike-dependent threshold adaptation. Thus, the system self-organizes towards the balance point, such that its AI activity arises from quasicritical fluctuations. The need for two independent adaptive mechanisms explains why different dynamical states are observed in the brain.",

    "abstract": "An indispensable feature of episodic memory is our ability to temporally piece together different elements of an experience into a coherent memory. Hippocampal \"time cells\" - neurons that represent temporal information - may play a critical role in this process. While these cells have been repeatedly found in rodents, it is still unclear to what extent similar temporal selectivity exists in the human hippocampus. Here we show that temporal context modulates the firing activity of human hippocampal neurons during structured temporal experiences. We recorded neuronal activity in the human brain while patients learned predictable sequences of pictures. We report that human time cells fire at successive moments in this task. Furthermore, time cells also signaled inherently changing temporal contexts during empty 10-second gap periods between trials, while participants waited for the task to resume. Finally, population activity allowed for decoding temporal epoch identity, both during sequence learning and during the gap periods. These findings suggest that human hippocampal neurons could play an essential role in temporally organizing distinct moments of an experience in episodic memory.\n\nSignificance StatementEpisodic memory refers to our ability to remember the \"what, where, and when\" of a past experience. Representing time is an important component of this form of memory. Here, we show that neurons in the human hippocampus represent temporal information. This temporal signature was observed both when participants were actively engaged in a memory task, as well as during 10s-long gaps when they were asked to wait before performing the task. Furthermore, the activity of the population of hippocampal cells allowed for decoding one temporal epoch from another. These results suggest a robust representation of time in the human hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "It is generally accepted that the number of neurons in a given brain area far exceeds the information that area encodes. For example, motor areas of the human brain contain tens of millions of neurons that control the activation of tens or at most hundreds of muscles. This massive redundancy implies the covariation of many neurons, which constrains the population activity to a low-dimensional manifold within the space of all possible patterns of neural activity. To gain a conceptual understanding of the complexity of the neural activity within a manifold, it is useful to estimate its dimensionality, which quantifies the number of degrees of freedom required to describe the observed population activity without significant information loss. While there are many algorithms for dimensionality estimation, we do not know which are well suited for analyzing neural activity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of several representative algorithms for estimating linearly and nonlinearly embedded data. We generated synthetic neural recordings with known intrinsic dimensionality and used them to test the algorithms accuracy and robustness. We emulated some of the important challenges associated with experimental data by adding noise, altering the nature of the embedding from the low-dimensional manifold to the high-dimensional recordings, varying the dimensionality of the manifold, and limiting the amount of available data. We demonstrated that linear algorithms overestimate the dimensionality of nonlinear, noise-free data. In cases of high noise, most algorithms overestimated dimensionality. We thus developed a denoising algorithm based on deep learning, the \"Joint Autoencoder\", which significantly improved subsequent dimensionality estimation. Critically, we found that all algorithms failed when the dimensionality was high (above 20) or when the amount of data used for estimation was low. Based on the challenges we observed, we formulated a pipeline for estimating the dimensionality of experimental neural data.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe number of neurons that we can record from has increased exponentially for decades; today we can simultaneously record from thousands of neurons. However, the individual firing rates are highly redundant. One approach to identifying important features from redundant data is to estimate the dimensionality of the neural recordings, which represents the number of degrees of freedom required to describe the data without significant information loss. Better understanding of dimensionality may also uncover the mechanisms of computation within a neural circuit. Circuits carrying out complex computations might be higher-dimensional than those carrying out simpler computations. Typically, studies have quantified neural dimensionality using one of several available methods despite a lack of consensus on which method would be most appropriate for neural data. In this work, we used several methods to investigate the accuracy of simulated neural data with properties mimicking those of actual neural recordings. Based on these results, we devised an analysis pipeline to estimate the dimensionality of neural recordings. Our work will allow scientists to extract informative features from a large number of highly redundant neurons, as well as quantify the complexity of information encoded by these neurons.",

    "abstract": "The inhibitory signaling of CD200 receptor 1 (CD200R) has been attributed to its NPxY signaling motif. However, NPxY-motifs are present in multiple protein families and are mostly known to mediate protein trafficking between subcellular locations rather than signaling. Therefore, we investigated whether additional motifs specify the inhibitory function of CD200R. We performed phylogenetic analysis of the intracellular domain of CD200R in mammals, birds, bony fish, amphibians and reptiles. Indeed, the tyrosine of the NPxY-motif is fully conserved across species, in line with its central role in CD200R signaling. In contrast, P295 of the NPxY-motif is not conserved. Instead, a conserved stretch of negatively charged amino acids, EEDE279, and two conserved residues P285 and K292 in the flanking region prior to the NPxY-motif are required for CD200R mediated inhibition of p-Erk, p-Akt308, p-Akt473, p-rpS6 and LPS-induced IL-8 secretion. Altogether, we show that instead of the more common NPxY-motif, CD200R signaling can be assigned to a unique signaling motif in mammals defined by: EEDExxPYxxYxxKxNxxY.",

    "abstract": "The modulation of hemolymph microbiota homeostasis is vital for the marine invertebrate innate immunity, while growing evidence shows that exosomes could serves as anti-bacterial immune factors, however, the relationship between exosomes and hemolymph microbiota homeostasis during pathogenic bacteria infection has not been addressed. Here, we determined that exosomes released from Vibrio parahaemolyticus-infected Scylla paramamosain (mud crabs) could reduce the mortality of the host during the infection by maintaining the homeostasis of hemolymph microbiota. We further confirmed that miR-224 was densely packaged in these exosomes and targeting to HSP70, which resulted in disruption of the HSP70-TRAF6 complex to release TRAF6 that allows it to interact with Ecsit. The interaction of TRAF6 with Ecsit regulates the production of mitochondrial ROS (mROS) and Anti-lipopolysaccharide factors (ALFs) expression in recipient hemocytes, which affects homeostasis of hemolymph microbiota in response to the pathogenic bacteria infection in mud crab. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first document that reports the role of exosome in the homeostasis of hemolymph microbiota during pathogen infection and a novel regulatory mechanism and crosstalk between exosomal miRNAs and innate immune response in crustaceans.\n\nAuthor summaryExosomes are small membrane vesicles of endocytic origin which are widely involved in the regulation of a variety of pathological processes in mammals. Yet, although the antibacterial function of exosomes has been discovered for many years, the relationship between exosomes and hemolymph microbiota homeostasis remains unknown. In the present study, we identified the miRNAs packaged by exosomes that were possibly involved in Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection by modulating hemolymph microbiota homeostasis in crustacean mud crab Scylla paramamosain. Moreover, it was found that miR-224 was densely packaged in exosomes after Vibrio parahaemolyticus challenge, resulting in the suppression of HSP70 and disruption of the HSP70-TRAF6 complex in recipient hemocytes, then the released TRAF6 was further interacted with Ecsit to regulate ROS and ALFs levels, which eventually affected hemolymph microbiota homeostasis to cope with pathogenic bacteria infection. Our finding is the first to reveal the relationship between exosomes and hemolymph microbiota homeostasis in animals, which shows a novel molecular mechanism of invertebrate resistance to pathogenic microbial infection.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal roundworms cause chronic debilitating disease in animals, including humans. A lack of effective vaccines and the emergence of widespread drug resistance only increase the need to better understand parasite clearance mechanisms within the host. Heligmosomoides polygyrus larvae induce a strong intestinal granuloma response within their murine host, which has been associated with resistance. Immune cells, mostly alternatively activated macrophages and eosinophils, accumulate around the tissue encysted parasites to immobilize and damage/kill developing worms. In a one dose (bolus) experimental infection, infected C57Bl/6 mice are unable to clear parasites which results in chronic infection with high worm burdens. However, using a frequent dose trickle model of infection, we, like others, have found that C57Bl/6 mice can clear infection. We found that the clearance is associated with higher granuloma numbers, but no changes in systemic/intestinal Th2 responses. Within the granulomas, we found that myeloid cells had a different transcriptional profile in each of the infected groups, and that high IgG1, but not IgG2c, IgA or IgE, levels were observed around the larvae of only trickle-infected mice. Our results highlight the importance of the granuloma in the hosts ability to clear H. polygyrus and emphasise the need to study this key tissue in more depth, rather than using correlates such as general intestinal or systemic responses.\n\nAUTHORS SUMMARYDespite decades of research on intestinal parasitic worms, we are still unable to clearly point to why so many people (approximately 1.8 billion) and most livestock/wild animals are infected with these parasites. We have made progress in understanding how the immune system responds to parasitic worms, and how these parasites manipulate our immune system. However, identifying effective clearance mechanisms is complex and context dependent. We have used a model of trickle infection (multiple low doses of parasites) to simulate how people/animals get infected in the real world. Using this model, we have identified the host/parasite interface (the granuloma) within the intestinal tissue to be key in determining the hosts ability to clear worms. Specific gene expression signatures in granuloma immune cells and the presence/absence of antibodies within the granuloma are key factors associated with parasite clearance. Surprisingly, more common identifiers of parasitic worm infections (increased serum antibody levels and/or generalized immune markers) did not associate with protection. These novel findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying effective parasitic worm clearance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundToxoplasma parasite alters the transduction of neurotransmitter signals and leads to changes in the level of brain neurotransmitters including tyrosine and dopamine, so, behavior changes can occur in infected hosts. Based on this concept, this study was conducted for evaluation of the tyrosine and dopamine serum level in infected mice with chronic toxoplasmosis.\n\nMaterials and methodsToxoplasma gondii (Prugniaud strain II) was injected intra-peritoneal into BALB/c mice to induce chronic toxoplasmosis. Modified agglutination test (MAT), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and microscopic methods were conducted to confirm the induction of chronic toxoplasmosis. The infected mice sera were separated at days 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 for evaluation of tyrosine and dopamine serum level using High-performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).\n\nResultsMicroscopic methods confirmed the formation of the Toxoplasma cysts in mice tissues. Inducing chronic toxoplasmosis is also confirmed by MAT, PCR and histological methods. HPLC results indicated a decrease in serum tyrosine level at days 40 in infected mice in comparison to control and the levels were too low to be measured at other times. However, a significantly high serum dopamine level was observed that gradually increased after parasite inoculation.\n\nConclusionsNo detection of tyrosine level in most of the sample groups is probably related to the very low concentration of tyrosine in sera. However, low concentration of tyrosine at days 40 and increase of dopamine in most of the sample groups suggests the production of dopamine from tyrosine due to the presence of Toxoplasma in infected mice.",

    "abstract": "Zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), also known as poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 13 (PARP13), is an antiviral factor that selectively targets viral RNA for degradation. ZAP is active against both DNA and RNA viruses, including important human pathogens such as hepatitis B virus and type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). ZAP selectively binds CpG dinucleotides through its N-terminal RNA-binding domain, which consists of four zinc fingers. ZAP also contains a central region that consists of a fifth zinc finger and two WWE domains. Through structural and biochemical studies, we found that the fifth zinc finger and tandem WWEs of ZAP combine into a single integrated domain that binds to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), a cellular polynucleotide. PAR binding is mediated by the second WWE module of ZAP and likely involves specific recognition of iso(ADP-ribose), a repeating structural unit of PAR. Mutation of the putative iso(ADP-ribose) binding site in ZAP abrogates the interaction in vitro and diminishes ZAP activity against a CpG-rich HIV-1 reporter virus. In cells, PAR facilitates formation of non-membranous sub-cellular compartments such as DNA repair foci, spindle poles and cytosolic RNA stress granules. Our results suggest that ZAP-mediated viral mRNA degradation is facilitated by PAR, and provides a biophysical rationale for the reported association of ZAP with RNA stress granules.",

    "abstract": "Although current antiretroviral therapies (ART) are successful in controlling HIV-1 infection, a stable viral reservoir reactivates when ART is discontinued. Consequently, there is a major research effort to develop approaches to disrupt the latent viral reservoir and enhance the immune systems ability to clear HIV-1. A number of small molecules, termed latency reversal agents (LRAs), have been identified which can reactivate latent HIV-1 in cell lines and patients cells ex vivo. However, clinical trials have suggested that combinations of LRAs will be required to efficiently reactivate HIV-1 in vivo, especially LRAs that act synergistically by functioning through distinct pathways. To identify novel LRAs, we used an image-based assay to screen a natural compound library for the ability to induce a low level of aggregation of resting primary CD4+ T cells from healthy donors. We identified celastrol as a novel LRA. Celastrol functions synergistically with other classes of LRA to reactivate latent HIV-1 in a Jurkat cell line, suggesting a novel mechanism in its LRA activity. Additionally, celastrol does not appear to activate resting CD4+ T cells at levels at which it can reactivate latent HIV-1. Celastrol appears to represent a novel class of LRAs and it therefore can serve as a lead compound for LRA development.",

We used 32 male Wistar rats, separated in four groups: Sedentary Control (S; n=8); Control with Training (T; n=8); Sedentary with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (SPAH; n=8); and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension with Training (TPAH; n=8). The rats trained for thirteen weeks on a treadmill. They had two weeks of adaptation training. The PAH was induced by application of monocrotaline 60 mg/kg. Consequential right ventricular dysfunction was observed after the 10th week of training. Rats in the control group received saline application. At the end of the 13th week, echocardiography analysis confirmed cardiac dysfunction. Collagen content and organization was assessed through picrosirius red staining and fractal dimension (FD) analysis, respectively. Transcript abundance was estimated through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Cardiac dysfunction was confirmed by the reduction in maximum pulmonary artery velocity and pulmonary artery acceleration time. Through histomorphometric assessment, we found no differences in the interstitial collagen FD between groups. Regarding gene expression, myh7 gene expression was upregulated in the TPAH group. However, this did not occur with the S group. PAH also increased the mRNA abundance of col1a1 in the SPAH and TPAH groups. Moreover, the TPAH group showed a higher abundance of this gene when compared to the S group. With these findings, we concluded that preventive exercise had a positive impact on compensated hypertrophy during pulmonary hypertension. This can be explained in part by the modulation of the extracellular matrix and myosin gene expression in trained rats.",

    "abstract": "Osteoporosis and bone fracture decrease quality of life. Bone regeneration is a notable technique for osteoporosis treatment. A previous study reported that F-box and WD-40 domain-containing protein 2 (FBXW2) and osteocalcin have the same shape in the periosteum after 5 weeks. However, the osteoblastic functions of FBXW2 are not clear. In this study, double fluorescent immunostaining revealed a small amount of osteocalcin in the area of FBXW2 aggregation at 1 week, periosteal cells, and osteocalcin pushed toward the edge of periosteum, and, apart from FBXW2 tubes at 2 weeks, multilayered periosteum-derived cells at 3 weeks and sticking of osteocalcin in the periosteum with cells at 4 weeks. At 5 weeks, FBXW2 disappeared at the root of periosteum-derived cells, while osteocalcin and cells remained. Based on these results, it is hypothesized that FBXW2 maintains tissue shapes and prevents escape of inner periosteal cells, and the disappearance of FBXW2 causes migration of periosteum-derived cells out of the periosteum along with osteocalcin. Furthermore, FBXW2 may play a role in dynamic tissue remodeling and bone formation.",

    "abstract": "1Traditional models for how morphogen gradients guide embryonic patterning fail to account for experimental observations of temporal refinement in gene expression domains. Dynamic positional information has recently emerged as a framework to address this shortcoming. Here, we explore two central aspects of dynamic positional information--the precision and placement of gene expression boundaries--in bistable genetic networks driven by morphogen gradients. First, we hypothesize that temporal morphogen decay may increase the precision of a boundary by compensating for variation in initial conditions that would otherwise lead neighboring cells with identical inputs to diverge to separate steady states. Second, we explore how diffusion of gene products may play a key role in placing gene expression boundaries. Using an existing model for Hb patterning in embryonic fruit flies, we show that diffusion permits boundaries to act as near-traveling wavefronts with local propagation speed determined by morphogen concentration. We then harness our understanding of near-traveling fronts to propose a method for achieving accurate steady-state boundary placement independent of initial conditions. Our work posits functional roles for temporally varying inputs and cell-to-cell coupling in the regulation and interpretation of dynamic positional information, illustrating that mathematical theory should serve to clarify not just our quantitative, but also our intuitive understanding of patterning processes.\n\n2 Author SummaryIn many developmental systems, cells interpret spatial gradients of chemical morphogens to produce gene expression boundaries in exact positions. The simplest mathematical models for \"positional information\" rely on threshold detection, but such models are not robust to variations in the morphogen gradient or initial protein concentrations. Furthermore, these models fail to account for experimental results showing dynamic shifts in boundary placement and increased boundary precision over time. Here, we propose two theoretical mechanisms for enhancing boundary precision and placement using a bistable toggle switch. Distinct from existing research in \"dynamic positional information\", this work posits a functional role for temporal decay in morphogen concentration and for diffusion of gene expression products, the latter of which is often omitted in quantitative models. We suggest that future research into dynamic positional information would benefit from perspectives that link local (cellular) and global (patterning) behaviors, as well as from mathematical theory that builds our intuitive understanding alongside more data-driven approaches.",

    "abstract": "Damming and diverting river water alters the channel characteristics and natural flow regime. The change in biotic and abiotic factors results in dissimilar habitat conditions upstream and downstream of the barrage. Given the habitat dissimilarity and therefore resource availability, we hypothesized the dissimilarity in waterbird abundance and species diversity in the river habitat upstream and downstream of the barrage. The study was conducted on a 24 km stretch of Ganga River at Narora, Uttar Pradesh, India. This stretch overlaps with a Ramsar site as well as an Important Bird and Biodiversity Area (IBA). Bird sampling was done using transect count method for summer and winter season in 2017. The abundance was studied in relation to three habitat variables viz. channel depth, channel width and anthropogenic disturbances using Generalized Linear Model. A total of 140 species of birds were recorded. There was statistically significant difference in the abundance of waterbirds between upstream and downstream stretch in winter season (Mann-Whitney U, p < 0.05). During winters, migratory waterbirds especially ducks and geese occupied the deep water upstream of barrage, while the downstream was mostly occupied by terns and cormorants. Waterbird species diversity was higher in downstream during winters (Effective Number of Species=28; Shannons Index= 3.35) and higher in upstream during summer (Effective Number of Species=25, Shannons Index=2.87). Channel width, channel depth and anthropogenic disturbance influenced waterbird abundance in both the seasons (Generalized Linear Model; p < 0.05). The influence of channel depth varied with season for the upstream stretch.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating the performance of metagenomics analyses has proven a challenge, due in part to limited ground-truth standards, broad application space, and numerous evaluation methods and metrics. Application of traditional clinical performance metrics (i.e. sensitivity, specificity, etc.) using taxonomic classifiers do not fit the \"one-bug-one-test\" paradigm. Ultimately, users need methods that evaluate fitness-for-purpose and identify their analyses strengths and weaknesses. Within a defined cohort, reporting performance metrics by taxon, rather than by sample, will clarify this evaluation. An estimated limit of detection, positive and negative control samples, and true positive and negative true results are necessary criteria for all investigated taxa. Use of summary metrics should be restricted to comparing results of similar cohorts and data, and should employ harmonic means and continuous products for each performance metric rather than arithmetic mean. Such consideration will ensure meaningful comparisons and evaluation of fitness-for-purpose.",

    "abstract": "Congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) infection can induce fetal brain abnormalities. Here, we investigated whether maternal ZIKV infection affects placental physiology and metabolic transport potential and impacts the fetal outcome, regardless of viral presence in the fetus at term. Low (103 PFU-ZIKVPE243; low ZIKV) and high (5x107 PFU-ZIKVPE243; high ZIKV) virus titers were injected into immunocompetent (ICompetent C57BL/6) and immunocompromised (ICompromised A129) mice at gestational day (GD) 12.5 for tissue collection at GD18.5 (term). High ZIKV elicited fetal death rates of 66% and 100%, whereas low ZIKV induced fetal death rates of 0% and 60% in C57BL/6 and A129 dams, respectively. All surviving fetuses exhibited intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and decreased placental efficiency. High-ZIKV infection in C57BL/6 and A129 mice resulted in virus detection in maternal spleens and placenta, but only A129 fetuses presented virus RNA in the brain. Nevertheless, pregnancies in both strains produced fetuses with decreased head sizes (p<0.05). Low-ZIKV-A129 dams had higher IL-6 and CXCL1 levels (p<0.05), and their placentas showed increased CCL-2 and CXCL-1 contents (p<0.05). In contrast, low-ZIKV-C57BL/6 dams had an elevated CCL2 serum level and increased type I and II IFN expression in the placenta. Notably, less abundant microvilli and mitochondrial degeneration were evidenced in the placental labyrinth zone (Lz) of ICompromised and high-ZIKV-ICompetent mice but not in low-ZIKV-C57BL/6 mice. In addition, decreased placental expression of the drug transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) and the lipid transporter Abca1 was detected in all ZIKV-infected groups, but Bcrp and Abca1 were only reduced in ICompromised and high-ZIKV ICompetent mice. Our data indicate that gestational ZIKV infection triggers specific proinflammatory responses and affects placental turnover and transporter expression in a manner dependent on virus concentration and maternal immune status. Placental damage may impair proper fetal-maternal exchange function and fetal growth/survival, likely contributing to congenital Zika syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have evidenced that the anatomical structure now known as the myodural bridge (MDB) connects the suboccipital musculature to the cervical spinal dura mater (SDM). In humans, the MDB passes through both the posterior atlanto-occipital and the posterior atlanto-axial interspaces. The present authors suggest that the MDB has important physiological functions in humans. The existence of the MDB in various mammals, including flying birds (Rock pigeons and Gallus domesticus) has been previously validated. Gentoo penguins are marine birds, able to make 450 dives per day, reaching depths of up to 660 feet. Gentoo penguins are also the worlds fastest diving birds. The present study was therefore carried out to investigate the existence and characteristics of the MDB in Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua), a non-flying, marine bird that can dive. While foraging, this penguin is able to reach speeds of up to 22 miles per hour. For this study, six Gentoo penguin specimens were dissected to observe the existence and composition of their MDB. Histological staining was also performed to analyze the anatomic relationships and characteristic of the MDB in the Gentoo penguin. In this study, it was found that the suboccipital musculature in the Gentoo penguin consists of the rectus capitis dorsalis minor (RCDmi) muscle and rectus capitis dorsalis major (RCDma) muscle. Dense connective tissue fibers were observed connecting these two suboccipital muscles to the spinal dura mater (SDM). This dense connective tissue bridge consists of primarily type I collagen fibers. Thus, this penguins MDB appears to be analogous to the MDB previously observed in humans. The present study evidences that the MDB not only exists in penguins but it also has unique features that distinguishes it from that of flying birds. Thus, this study advances the understanding of the morphological characteristics of the MDB in flightless, marine birds.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of genetic material from field-collected tsetse (Glossina spp) in ten study areas has been used to predict that the distance ({delta}) dispersed per generation increases as effective population densities (De) decrease, displaying negative density dependent dispersal (NDDD). This result is an artefact arising primarily from errors in estimates of S, the area occupied by a subpopulation, and thereby in De, the effective subpopulation density. The fundamental, dangerously misleading, error lies in the assumption that S can be estimated as the area ([S]) regarded as being covered by traps. Errors in the estimates of{delta} are magnified because variation in estimates of S is greater than for all other variables measured, and accounts for the greatest proportion of variation in{delta} . The errors result in anomalously high correlations between{delta} and S, and the appearance of NDDD, with a slope of -0.5 for the regressions of log({delta}) on log(e), even in simulations where dispersal has been set as density independent. A complementary mathematical analysis confirms these findings. Improved error estimates for the crucial parameter b, the rate of increase in genetic distance with increasing geographic separation, suggest that three of the study areas should have been excluded because b is not significantly greater than zero. Errors in census population estimates result from a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between trap placement and expected tsetse catch. These errors are exacerbated through failure to adjust for variations in trapping intensity, trap performance, and in capture probabilities between geographical situations and between tsetse species. Claims of support in the literature for NDDD are spurious. There is no suggested explanation for how NDDD might have evolved. We reject the NDDD hypothesis and caution that the idea should not be allowed to influence policy on tsetse and trypanosomiasis control.\n\nAuthor summaryGenetic analysis of field-sampled tsetse (Glossina spp) has been used to suggest that, as tsetse population densities decrease, rates of dispersal increase - displaying negative density dependent dispersal (NDDD). It is further suggested that NDDD might apply to all tsetse species and that, consequently, tsetse control operations might unleash enhanced invasion of areas cleared of tsetse, prejudicing the long-term success of control campaigns. We demonstrate that NDDD in tsetse is an artefact consequent on multiple errors of analysis and interpretation. The most serious of these errors stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the way in which traps sample tsetse, resulting in huge errors in estimates of the areas sampled by the traps, and occupied by the subpopulations being sampled. Errors in census population estimates are made worse through failure to adjust for variations in trapping intensity, trap performance, and in capture probabilities between geographical situations, and between tsetse species. The errors result in the appearance of NDDD, even in modelling situations where rates of dispersal are expressly assumed independent of population density. We reject the NDDD hypothesis and caution that the idea should not be allowed to influence policy on tsetse and trypanosomiasis control.",
