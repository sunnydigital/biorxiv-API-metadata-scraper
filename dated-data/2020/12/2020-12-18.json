They are also essential nutrients for phytophagous insects, including pollinators, that cannot synthesize sterols. Despite the well-described composition and diversity in vegetative plant tissues, few studies have examined phytosterol diversity in pollen.\nC_LIO_LIWe quantified 25 pollen phytosterols in 122 plant species (105 genera, 51 families) to determine their composition and diversity across plant taxa. We searched literature and databases for plant phylogeny, environmental conditions, and pollinator guilds of the species to examine the relationships with pollen sterols.\nC_LIO_LI24-methylenecholesterol, sitosterol and isofucosterol were the most common and abundant pollen sterols. We found phylogenetic clustering of twelve individual sterols, total sterol content and sterol diversity, and of sterol groupings that reflect their underlying biosynthesis pathway (24 carbon alkylation, ring B desaturation). Plants originating in tropical-like climates (higher mean annual temperature, lower temperature seasonality, higher precipitation in wettest quarter) were more likely to record higher pollen sterol content. However, pollen sterol composition and content showed no clear relationship with pollinator guilds.\nC_LIO_LIOur study is the first to show that pollen sterol diversity is phylogenetically clustered and that pollen sterol content may adapt to environmental conditions.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "With the increasing ability to use high-throughput next-generation sequencing to quantify the diversity of the human T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire, the ability to use TCR sequences to infer antigen-specificity could greatly aid potential diagnostics and therapeutics. Here, we use a machine-learning approach known as Restricted Boltzmann Machine to develop a sequence-based inference approach to identify antigen-specific TCRs. Our approach combines probabilistic models of TCR sequences with clone abundance information to extract TCR sequence motifs central to an antigen-specific response. We use this model to identify patient personalized TCR motifs that respond to individual tumor and infectious disease antigens, and to accurately discriminate specific from non-specific responses. Furthermore, the hidden structure of the model results in an interpretable representation space where TCRs responding to the same antigen cluster, correctly discriminating the response of TCR to different viral epitopes. The model can be used to identify condition specific responding TCRs. We focus on the examples of TCRs reactive to candidate neoantigens and selected epitopes in experiments of stimulated TCR clone expansion.\n\nAuthor SummaryLarge repertoires of immune cells, such as T cells, are increasingly made available by high-throughput sequencing. Exploiting such datasets to infer how T-cell respond to antigens could help design vaccines and adoptive T-cell therapies. We here propose an approach based on probabilistic machine learning to identify and characterize responding T cells. After learning, this approach is able to distinguish clones that specifically respond to different antigen stimulations. The model parameters and the low-dimensional representations of the T-cell sequences identify sequence motifs underlying T-cell recognition at the molecular level. The approach is illustrated on repertoire data describing in vitro stimulation of T cells by cancer-related neoantigens, as well as on data for common infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells use amoeboid migration to pass through confined tissues to reach the lymph nodes, and this homing function is crucial for immune responses. The underlying mechanisms for this type of migration remain unknown. As vimentin intermediate filaments regulate adhesion-dependent migration, we analyzed whether they have a similar effect on amoeboid migration. We show that lack of vimentin impairs amoeboid migration in vitro in confined environments, and blocks lymph-node homing in mice in vivo. Importantly, we show that vimentin-deficient dendritic cells have a lower coupling factor between cell speed and persistence and reduced target search efficiency (e.g., finding a pathogen, or another cell). These data show that the characteristics of vimentin in its dynamic regulation of cell stiffness and load-bearing, and also elastic capacity, appear to explain the coupling between their migratory ability and search efficiency. Taken together, these data show that vimentin provides the specific mechano-dynamics required for dendritic cell migration and for efficient target searching.\n\nSummary statementVimentin contributes to the mechanical stiffness of cells required for amoeboid cell migration through confined spaces, and improves cell-search efficiency. Vimentin-deficient cells migrate more slowly and their migration speed is less coupled to persistence compared to control cells.",

We introduce a trait-based optimality theory that unifies the treatment of stomatal responses and biochemical acclimation of plants to environments changing on multiple timescales. Tested with experimental data from 18 species, our model successfully predicts the simultaneous decline in carbon assimilation rate, stomatal conductance, and photosynthetic capacity during progressive soil drought. It also correctly predicts the dependencies of gas exchange on atmospheric vapour pressure deficit, temperature, and CO2. Model predictions are also consistent with widely observed empirical patterns, such as the distribution of hydraulic strategies. Our unified theory opens new avenues for reliably modelling the interactive effects of drying soil and rising atmospheric CO2 on global photosynthesis and transpiration.",

    "abstract": "When we intensively train a timing skill, such as learning to play the piano, we do not only produce brain changes associated with task-specific learning, but also improve the performance on other temporal behaviors that depend on these tuned neural resources. Since the neural basis of time learning and generalization are still unknown, we measured the changes in neural activity associated with the transfer of learning from perceptual to motor timing. We found that intense training in an interval discrimination task increased the acuity of time perception in a group of subjects that also showed learning transfer, expressed as a reduction in tapping variability during an internally-driven periodic motor task. However, we also found subjects with no learning and generalization effects, and a third group with no signs of learning but with practice-based decreases in temporal variability in the motor task. Notably, these heterogeneous populations of subjects shared a common increase of activity in the medial premotor areas and the putamen in the post-with respect to the pre-training session of the tapping task. These findings support the idea that the core timing network is constantly refining its ability to time behaviors in different contexts and that practice is critical for keeping the neural clock attuned and properly functioning.",

    "abstract": "Immediate early genes (IEGs) are widely used as a marker for neuronal plasticity. Here, we model the dynamics of IEG expression as a consecutive, irreversible first order reaction with a limiting substrate. We show that such a model, together with two-photon in vivo imaging of IEG expression, can be used to identify distinct neuronal subsets representing multiple memories. We image retrosplenial cortex (RSc) of cFOS-GFP transgenic mice to follow the dynamics of cellular changes resulting from both seizure and contextual fear conditioning behaviour. The analytical expression allowed us to segregate the neurons based on their temporal response to one specific behavioural event, thereby improving the sensitivity of detecting plasticity related neurons. This enables us to establish representation of context in RSc at the cellular scale following memory acquisition. Thus, we obtain a general method which distinguishes neurons that took part in multiple temporally separated events, by measuring fluorescence from individual neurons in live mice.\n\nSummaryIdentifying neuronal ensemble associated with different memories is vital in modern neuroscience. Meenakshi et al model and use the temporal expression dynamics of IEGs rather than thresholded intensities of the probes to identify the neurons encoding different memory in vivo.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=94 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/423270v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d6c197org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3fca7aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@64615org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e30dbc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Honeybee gut microbiota transmitted via social interactions are beneficial to the host health. Although the microbial community is relatively stable, individual variations and high strain-level diversity have been detected across honeybees. Although the bee gut microbiota structure is influenced by environmental factors, the heritability of the gut members and the contribution of the host genetics remains elusive. Considering bees within a colony are not readily genetically identical due to the polyandry of queen, we hypothesize that the microbiota structure can be shaped by host genetics. We used shotgun metagenomics to simultaneously profile the microbiota and host genotypes of individuals from hives of four different subspecies. Gut composition is more distant between genetically different bees at both phylotype- and \"sequence-discrete population\"-level. We then performed a successive passaging experiment within colonies of hybrid bees generated by artificial insemination, which revealed that the microbial composition dramatically shifts across batches of bees during the social transmission. Specifically, different strains from the phylotype of Snodgrassella alvi are preferentially selected by genetically varied hosts, and strains from different hosts show a remarkably biased distribution of single-nucleotide polymorphism in the Type IV pili loci. A genome-wide association analysis identified that the relative abundance of a cluster of Bifidobacterium strains is associated with the host glutamate receptor gene that is specifically expressed in the bee brain. Finally, mono-colonization of Bifidobacterium with a specific polysaccharide utilization locus impacts the expression and alternative splicing of the gluR-B gene, which is associated with an altered circulating metabolomic profile. Our results indicated that host genetics influence the bee gut composition, and suggest a gut-brain connection implicated in the gut bacterial strain preference. Honeybees have been used extensively as a model organism for social behaviors, genetics, and gut microbiome. Further identification of host genetic function as shaping force of microbial structure will advance our understanding of the host-microbe interactions.",

    "abstract": "Lake Magic is one of the acidic hypersaline lakes (ca. 1 km in diameter) present within the Yilgarn Craton in WA. This unique lake exhibits extremely low pH (<1.6) coupled to very high salinity (32% TDS) with the highest concentration of aluminium (1774 mg/L) and silica (510 mg/L) in the world. Previous studies on Lake Magic diversity has revealed that the lake hosts acidophilic, acidotolerant, halophilic and halotolerant bacterial species. These studies provide indicators of the population residing within the lake. However, they do not emphasize the survival mechanisms adopted by the resident microorganisms and how the diversity of microbial populations residing within the lake changes during the dynamic stages of flooding, evapo-concentration and desiccation. We have studied the bacterial and fungal diversity in Lake Magic via amplicon sequencing and functional analysis through different stages of the lake in a span of one year, in the salt and sediment layer. Our results highlight that the diversity in Lake Magic is strongly driven by the pH and salt concentrations at different stages of the lake. The microbial community becomes more specialised in specific functions during more extreme stages. This also suggests that microbial interactions are involved in stabilising the ecosystem and is responsible for the resistance and resilience of these communities as the interactions of these microbes create a safe haven for other microbes to survive during more extreme stages.",

Human surfactant protein D (SP-D) is known to interact with spike protein of SARS-CoV, but its immune-surveillance against SARS-CoV-2 is not known.\n\nObjectiveThis study aimed to examine the potential of a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) as an inhibitor of replication and infection of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsrfhSP-D interaction with spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and hACE-2 receptor was predicted via docking analysis. The inhibition of interaction between spike protein and ACE-2 by rfhSP-D was confirmed using direct and indirect ELISA. The effect of rfhSP-D on replication and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical samples was studied by measuring the expression of RdRp gene of the virus using qPCR.\n\nMeasurements and Main ResultsIn-silico interaction studies indicated that three amino acid residues in the RBD of spike of SARS-CoV-2 were commonly involved in interacting with rfhSP-D and ACE-2. Studies using clinical samples of SARS-CoV-2 positive cases (asymptomatic, n=7 and symptomatic, n=8 and negative controls n=15) demonstrated that treatment with 5M rfhSP-D inhibited viral replication by ~5.5 fold and was more efficient than Remdesivir (100 M). Approximately, a 2-fold reduction in viral infectivity was also observed after treatment with 5M rfhSP-D.\n\nConclusionsThese results conclusively demonstrate that the calcium independent rfhSP-D mediated inhibition of binding between the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human ACE-2, its host cell receptor, and a significant reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication in-vitro.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-2 is spreading rapidly in the absence of validated tools to control the growing epidemic besides social distancing and masks. Many efforts are ongoing for the development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 since there is an imminent need to develop effective interventions for controlling and preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread. Essentially all vaccines in most advanced phases are based on the induction of antibody response against either whole or part of spike (S) protein. Differently, we developed an original strategy to induce CD8+ T cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) immunity based on in vivo engineering of extracellular vesicles (EVs). We exploited this technology with the aim to identify a clinical candidate defined as DNA vectors expressing SARS-CoV-2 antigens inducing a robust CD8+ T-cell response. This is a new vaccination approach employing a DNA expression vector encoding a biologically inactive HIV-1 Nef protein (Nefmut) showing an unusually high efficiency of incorporation into EVs even when foreign polypeptides are fused to its C-terminus. Nanovesicles containing Nefmut-fused antigens released by muscle cells are internalized by antigen-presenting cells leading to cross-presentation of the associated antigens thereby priming of antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells. To apply this technology to a design of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, we recovered DNA vectors expressing the products of fusion between Nefmut and four viral antigens, namely N- and C-terminal moieties of S (referred to as S1 and S2), M, and N. All fusion products are efficiently uploaded in EVs. When the respective DNA vectors were injected in mice, a strong antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immunity was generated. Most important, high levels of virus-specific CD8+ T cells were found in bronchoalveolar lavages of immunized mice. Co-injection of DNA vectors expressing the diverse SARS-CoV-2 antigens resulted in additive immune responses in both spleen and lung. EVs engineered with SARS-CoV-2 antigens proved immunogenic also in the human system through cross-priming assays carried out with ex vivo human cells. Hence, DNA vectors expressing Nefmut-based fusion proteins can be proposed as anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates.",

Studies have suggested the ability of human SP-D to recognise spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV; its interaction with HCoV-229E strain leads to viral inhibition in human bronchial epithelial (16HBE) cells. Previous studies have reported that a recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) composed of 8 Gly-X-Y repeats, neck and CRD region, can act against a range of viral pathogens including influenza A Virus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo models. In this context, this study was aimed at examining the likely protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection. rfhSP-D showed a dose-responsive binding to S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and its receptor binding domain. Importantly, rfhSP-D inhibited interaction of S1 protein with the HEK293T cells overexpressing Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2. The protective role of rfhSP-D against SARS-CoV-2 infection as an entry inhibitor was further validated by the use of pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein; ~0.5 RLU fold reduction in viral entry was seen following rfhSP-D treatment (10 g/ml). The results highlight the therapeutic potential of rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection and merits pre-clinical studies in murine models.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 infection causes severe symptoms in a subset of patients, suggesting the presence of certain unknown risk factors. Although antibodies against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike have been shown prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection, the effects of antibodies against other spike protein domains are largely unknown. Here, we screened a series of anti-spike monoclonal antibodies from COVID-19 patients, and found that some of antibodies against the N-terminal domain (NTD) dramatically enhanced the binding capacity of the spike protein to ACE2, and thus increased SARS-CoV2 infectivity. Surprisingly, mutational analysis revealed that all the infectivity-enhancing antibodies recognized a specific site on the surface of the NTD. The antibodies against this infectivity-enhancing site were detected in all samples of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the study. However, the ratio of infectivity-enhancing antibodies to neutralizing antibodies differed among patients. Furthermore, the antibodies against the infectivity-enhancing site were detected in 3 out of 48 uninfected donors, albeit at low levels. These findings suggest that the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity-enhancing site could be considered as a possible exacerbating factors for COVID-19 and that a spike protein lacking such antibody epitopes may be required for safe vaccine development, especially for individuals with pre-existing enhancing antibodies.",

In this study we report the temporal kinetics of viral RNA and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in serum during the course of COVID-19. We show that a RNAemia occurs more frequently and lasts longer in patients that develop critical disease compared to patients that develop moderate or severe disease. Furthermore we show that concentrations of IL-10 and MCP-1--but not IL-6--are associated with viral load in serum. However, higher levels of IL-6 were associated with the development of critical disease.

However, there is currently little direct evidence indicate that insect pheromones can be produced by symbionts. Using Bactrocera dorsalis as a model system, we demonstrate that Bacillus sp. in the rectum of male B. dorsalis plays a pivotal role in sex pheromones production. We demonstrate that 2,3,5-trimethylpyrazine (TMP) and 2,3,5,6-tetramethylpyrazine (TTMP) are sex pheromones produced in the male rectums. Mature virgin females can be strongly attracted by TMP and TTMP. TMP and TTMP contents in male rectums can be decreased when rectal bacteria are inhibited with antibiotics. Moreover, Bacillus sp. isolated from male rectum can produce TMP and TTMP when providing with substrates-glucose and threonine, for which the contents are significantly higher in rectums of mature males. These findings highlight the influence of microbial symbionts on insect pheromones and provide an example of direct bacterial production of pheromones in insects.",

    "abstract": "The single flagellum of African trypanosomes is essential in multiple aspects of the parasite development. The FLAgellar Member 8 protein (FLAM8), localised to the tip of the flagellum in cultured insect forms, was identified as a marker of the locking event that controls flagellum length. Here, we investigated whether FLAM8 could also reflect the flagellum maturation state in other stages. We observed that FLAM8 distribution extended along the entire flagellar cytoskeleton in mammalian infective forms. Then, a rapid FLAM8 concentration to the distal tip occurs during differentiation into early insect forms, illustrating for the first time the remodeling of an existing flagellum in trypanosomes. In the tsetse cardia, FLAM8 further localizes to the entire length of the new flagellum during an asymmetric division. Strikingly, in parasites dividing in the tsetse midgut and in the salivary glands, the amount and distribution of FLAM8 in the new flagellum was seen to predict the daughter cell fate. We propose and discuss how FLAM8 could be considered as a meta-marker of the flagellum stage and maturation state in trypanosomes.\n\nSummary statementThe trypanosome protein FLAM8 displays a dynamic and stage-specific distribution during the entire parasite cycle, representing a novel marker of the flagellum stage and maturation state.",

    "abstract": "Our studies suggest that neural stemness contributes to cell tumorigenicity. The basic cell physiological machineries and developmental programs, such as cell cycle, ribosomes, proteasomes, epigenetic factors, etc., which are upregulated in and promote cancers, are enriched in embryonic neural cells. How these machineries are coordinated is unknown. Here, we show that loss of neural stemness in cancer cells or neural stem cells leads to simultaneous downregulation of components of ribosomes and proteasomes, which are responsible for protein synthesis and degradation, respectively, and downregulation of major epigenetic factors. Inhibition of PRMT1 causes neuron-like differentiation, downregulation of a similar set of proteins, and alteration of subcellular localization of ribosome and proteasome components. PRMT1 interacts with these components, catalyzes arginine methylation of them and protects them from degradation, thereby maintaining a high level of expression of epigenetic factors that maintain neural stemness. PRMT1 inhibition results in repression of cell tumorigenicity. Therefore, PRMT1 coordinates ribosomes and proteasomes to match the needs for high protein production and protein homeostasis in cells with fast cell cycle and proliferation.",

Here we leverage genetic and chemical approaches to parse the specific functions of the higher orders of H3K79me in maintaining cell identity. DOT1L interacts with AF10 (Mllt10) which recognizes unmodified H3K27 and boosts higher order H3K79 methylation. AF10 deletion evicts higher order H3K79me2/3, and reorganizes H3K79me1 to the transcription start site, to facilitate iPSC formation in the absence of steady state transcriptional changes. Instead, AF10 loss redistributes RNA polymerase II to a uniquely pluripotent pattern at highly expressed, rapidly transcribed housekeeping genes.

In experimental analysist of these ten genes, mRNA transcript levels for ARID3B, CD276, LOXL1, NEO1, SCAMP2, and UBL7 were significantly decreased in iris tissues from XFS patients compared to control samples. Genes with genetically determined expression changes in XFS were significantly enriched for genes associated with inflammatory conditions. We further explored the health consequences of high susceptibility to XFS using a large electronic health record and observed a higher incidence of XFS comorbidity with inflammatory and connective tissue diseases.

    "abstract": "SNP arrays are powerful tools for high-resolution studies of the genetic basis of complex traits, facilitating both population genomic and selective breeding research. The European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) and the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) are the two most important fish species for Mediterranean aquaculture. While selective breeding programmes increasingly underpin stocky supply for this industry, genomic selection is not yet widespread. Genomic selection has major potential to expedite genetic gain, in particular for traits practically impossible to measure on selection candidates, such as disease resistance and fillet yield. The aim of our study was to design a combined-species 60K SNP array for both European seabass and gilthead seabream, and to validate its performance on farmed and wild populations from numerous locations throughout the species range. To achieve this, high coverage Illumina whole genome sequencing of pooled samples was performed for 24 populations of European seabass and 27 populations of gilthead seabream. This resulted in a database of ~20 million SNPs per species, which were then filtered to identify high-quality variants and create the final set for the development of the  MedFish SNP array. The array was then tested by genotyping a subset of the discovery populations and demonstrated a high conversion rate to functioning polymorphic assays on the array (92% in seabass: 89% in seabream) and repeatability (99.4 - 99.7%). The platform interrogates ~30K markers in each fish species, includes features such as SNPs previously shown to be associated with performance traits, and is enriched for SNPs predicted to alter protein function. The array was demonstrated to be effective at detecting population structure across a wide range of fish populations from diverse geographical origins, and to examine the extent of haplotype sharing among Mediterranean fish farms. Therefore, the MedFish array enables efficient and accurate high-throughput genotyping for genome-wide distributed SNPs on each fish species, and will facilitate stock management, population genomics approaches, and acceleration of selective breeding through genomic selection.",

    "abstract": "TxtC is an unusual bifunctional cytochrome P450 that is able to perform sequential aliphatic and aromatic hydroxylation of the diketopiperazine substrate thaxtomin D in two remote sites to produce thaxtomin A. Though the X-ray structure of TxtC complexed with thaxtomin D revealed a binding mode for its aromatic hydroxylation, the preferential hydroxylation site is aliphatic C14. It is thus intriguing to unravel how TxtC accomplishes such two-step catalytic hydroxylation on distinct aliphatic and aromatic carbons and why the aliphatic site is preferred in the hydroxylation step. In this work, by employing molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, we revealed that thaxtomin D could adopt two different conformations in the TxtC active site, which were equal in energy with either the aromatic C-H or aliphatic C14-H laying towards the active Cpd I oxyferryl moiety. Further ONIOM calculations indicated that the energy barrier for the rate-limiting hydroxylation step on the aliphatic C14 site was 8.9 kcal/mol more favorable than that on the aromatic C20 site. The hydroxyl group on the monohydroxylated intermediate thaxtomin B C14 site formed hydrogen bonds with Ser280 and Thr385, which induced the L-Phe moiety to rotate around the C{beta}-C{gamma} bond of the 4-nitrotryptophan moiety. Thus, it adopted an energy favorable conformation with aromatic C20 adjacent to the oxyferryl moiety. In addition, the hydroxyl group induced solvent water molecules to enter the active site, which propelled thaxtomin B towards the heme plane and resulted in heme distortion. Based on this geometrical layout, the rate-limiting aromatic hydroxylation energy barrier decreased to 15.4 kcal/mol, which was comparable to that of the thaxtomin D aliphatic hydroxylation process. Our calculations indicated that heme distortion lowered the energy level of the lowest Cpd I -vacant orbital, which promoted electron transfer in the rate-limiting thaxtomin B aromatic hydroxylation step in TxtC.",

    "abstract": "Ulcerative colitis is one kind of colonic mucosa damage, shows high number of inflammatory epithelial cells. Dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) induce a milder onset of colitis or a more aggressive response. It may damage the protective effects on intestinal barrier. In this study, we investigated the damaging of colon crypts, evaluated the smooth muscle tension beneath corrupted crypts in DSS exposed mice.\n\nMethodsfemale specific-pathogen-free BALB/C mice (n=16) are randomly divided as: group A: control mice (n=4); group B: DSS-mice (colitis, 5% DSS in drink water, days 1 to 7, n = 12). The DSS is replaced every 2 days. On day 8, mice colons are excised from the colon-cecal junction to the anus. The distal colon segment is longitude incision and aberrant crypt area are determined by methylene blue staining method. The smooth muscle strip is separated and prepared for passive tension tests. The rest segment is fixed with 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin. Histological scores are evaluated in hematoxylin-eosin staining section: crypt damage (none = 0, basal 1/3 damaged = 1, basal 2/3 damaged = 2, only the surface epithelium is intact = 3, and entire crypt and epithelium are lost = 4). The smooth muscle passive tension beneath the aberrant crypt area in DSS-mice are tested and compared with the preparations from control mice.\n\nResultsIn DSS uptake mice, the inflammation in large intestine mucosa damaged crypts with architectural distortions on day 7 (n=7). In crypts damage area, the smooth muscle passive tension and relative myogenic spontaneous contraction parameters are significantly reduced under the high preload conditions. The maximum rate of change of velocity of spontaneous contraction was noticeable attenuated.\n\nConclusionOur findings demonstrate that low dosage DSS water drink result in corrupted colonic crypts. The corrupted crypts damage the large intestinal epithelium barrier, affect the smooth muscle functions, which declined in myogenic spontaneous contraction under the preload. This further may reduce the peristalsis in large intestine.",

However, inter-species differences in the mechanisms regulating excitation-contraction coupling can limit the translation of experimental findings from animal models to human physiology, and undermine the assessment of drugs efficacy and safety. Here, we built a suite of translators for quantitatively mapping electrophysiological responses in ventricular myocytes across species. We trained these statistical operators using a broad dataset obtained by simulating populations of our biophysically detailed computational models of action potential and Ca2+ transient in mouse, rabbit, and human. We then tested our translators against experimental data describing the response to stimuli, such as ion channel block, change in beating rate, and {beta}-adrenergic challenge. We demonstrate that this approach is well suited to predicting the effects of perturbations across different species or experimental conditions, and suggest its integration into mechanistic studies and drug development pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Advances in our understanding of cellular functions and phenotypes in the brain rely on technically robust experimental in vivo models with face validity towards human disease. The cuprizone toxin-induced demyelination model is widely used to investigate pathophysiological mechanisms of demyelinating and remyelinating phases of multiple sclerosis. The C57BL6 mouse is a common inbred strain used as the genetic background for genetically engineered and congenic mice. Substrains of C57BL6 mice sourced from distinct vendors are often treated as equivalent in research studies. Here, we demonstrated that an alternative dosing approach via oral gavage with a well-tolerated, lower dose of cuprizone resulted in significant differences in C57BL/6NTac (Taconic) over C57BL/6J (Jax) mice. With consistent dosing of cuprizone for 5 weeks, body weights were significantly affected in C57BL/6NTac versus C57BL/6J mice. DT-MRI showed significant demyelination in white matter regions in the C57BL/6NTac mice. Concomitantly, histology analysis illustrated increased microgliosis and proliferation in C57BL/6NTac compared with C57BL/6J mice. These observations suggest that the C57BL/6NTac substrain of C57BL6 mice is more vulnerable to cuprizone challenge. Genetic factors along with breeder source appear to influence susceptibility to cuprizone toxin. Thus, the awareness of the limitations of in vivo models in addition to informed decision making on the appropriate background substrain can greatly improve sensitivity and reproducibility of results and use for evaluating investigational therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Classically, psychiatric disorders have been considered to lack defining pathology, but recent work has demonstrated consistent disruption at the molecular level, characterized by transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations.1-3 In ASD, upregulation of microglial, astrocyte, and immune signaling genes, downregulation of specific synaptic genes, and attenuation of regional gene expression differences are observed.1,2,4-6 However, whether these changes are limited to the cortical association areas profiled is unknown. Here, we perform RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on 725 brain samples spanning 11 distinct cortical areas in 112 ASD cases and neurotypical controls. We identify substantially more genes and isoforms that differentiate ASD from controls than previously observed. These alterations are pervasive and cortex-wide, but vary in magnitude across regions, roughly showing an anterior to posterior gradient, with the strongest signal in visual cortex, followed by parietal cortex and the temporal lobe. We find a notable enrichment of ASD genetic risk variants among cortex-wide downregulated synaptic plasticity genes and upregulated protein folding gene isoforms. Finally, using snRNA-seq, we determine that regional variation in the magnitude of transcriptomic dysregulation reflects changes in cellular proportion and cell-type-specific gene expression, particularly impacting L3/4 excitatory neurons. These results highlight widespread, genetically-driven neuronal dysfunction as a major component of ASD pathology in the cerebral cortex, extending beyond association cortices to involve primary sensory regions.",

We recently found that SARS-CoV-2 provoked an anti-bacterial like response and activation of TLR4 pathway at the very early stage of infection in animal models. This abnormal immune response led to emergency granulopoiesis and sepsis. However, the original trigger of TLR4 signaling by SARS-CoV-2 is unknown. We here identified that the trimeric spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 could bind to TLR4 directly and robustly activate downstream signaling in monocytes and neutrophils. Moreover, specific TLR4 or NFKB inhibitor, or knockout of MyD88 could significantly block IL-1B induction by spike protein. We thus reveal that spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a potent stimulus causing TLR4 activation and sepsis related abnormal responses.",

    "abstract": "Human adenovirus type 4 (HAdV-E4) is the only type (and serotype) classified within species Human mastadenovirus E that has been isolated from a human host to the present. Recent phylogenetic analysis of whole genome sequences of strains representing the spectrum of intratypic genetic diversity described to date identified two major evolutionary lineages designated phylogroups (PG) I, and II, and validated the early clustering of HAdV-E4 genomic variants into two major groups by low resolution restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In this study we expanded our original analysis of intra- and inter-PG genetic variability, and used a panel of viruses representative of the spectrum of genetic diversity described for HAdV-E4 to examine the magnitude of inter- and intra-PG phenotypic diversity using an array of cell-based assays and a cotton rat model of HAdV respiratory infection. Our proteotyping of HAdV-E strains using concatenated protein sequences in selected coding regions including E1A, E1B-19K and -55K, DNA polymerase, L4-100K, various E3 proteins, and E4-34K confirmed that the two clades encode distinct variants/proteotypes at most of these loci. Our in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that PG I and PG II differ in their growth, spread, and cell killing phenotypes in cell culture and in their pulmonary pathogenic phenotypes. Surprisingly, the differences in replicative fitness documented in vitro between PGs did not correlate with the differences in virulence observed in the cotton rat model. This body of work is the first reporting phenotypic correlates of naturally occurring intratypic genetic variability for HAdV-E4.\n\nIMPORTANCEHuman adenovirus type 4 (HAdV-E4) is a prevalent causative agent of acute respiratory illness of variable severity and of conjunctivitis and comprises two major phylogroups that carry distinct coding variations in proteins involved in viral replication and modulation of host responses to infection. Our data show that PG I and PG II are intrinsically different regarding their ability to grow and spread in culture and to cause pulmonary disease in cotton rats.\n\nThis is the first report of phenotypic divergence among naturally occurring known genetic variants of a HAdV type of medical importance. This research reveals readily detectable phenotypic differences between strains representing phylogroups I and II, and it introduces a unique experimental system for the elucidation of the genetic basis of adenovirus fitness and virulence and thus for increasing our understanding of the implications of intratypic genetic diversity in the presentation and course of HAdV-E4-associated disease.",

    "abstract": "The highly conserved chaperonin GroESL performs a crucial role in protein folding, however the essential cellular pathways that rely on this chaperone are underexplored. Loss of GroESL leads to severe septation defects in diverse bacteria, suggesting the folding function of GroESL may be integrated with the bacterial cell cycle at the point of cell division. Here, we describe new connections between GroESL and the bacterial cell cycle, using the model organism Caulobacter crescentus. Using a proteomics approach, we identify candidate GroESL client proteins that become insoluble or are degraded specifically when GroESL folding is insufficient, revealing several essential proteins that participate in cell division and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. We demonstrate that other cell cycle events such as DNA replication and chromosome segregation are able to continue when GroESL folding is insufficient, and find that deficiency of the bacterial actin homologue FtsA function mediates the GroESL-dependent block in cell division. Our data suggest that a GroESL-FtsA interaction is required to maintain normal dynamics of the FtsZ scaffold and divisome functionality in C. crescentus. In addition to supporting FtsA function, we show that GroESL is required to maintain the flow of peptidoglycan precursors into the growing cell wall. Linking a chaperone to cell division may be a conserved way to coordinate environmental and internal cues that signal when it is safe to divide.\n\nImportanceAll organisms depend on mechanisms that protect proteins from misfolding and aggregation. GroESL is a highly conserved molecular chaperone that functions to prevent protein aggregation in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. Despite detailed biochemical understanding of GroESL function, the in vivo pathways that strictly depend on this chaperone remain poorly defined in most species. This study provides new insights into how GroESL is linked to the bacterial cell division machinery, a crucial target of current and future antimicrobial agents. We identify a functional interaction between GroESL and FtsA, a conserved bacterial actin homologue, suggesting that as in eukaryotes, some bacteria exhibit a connection between cytoskeletal actin proteins and chaperonins. Our work further defines how GroESL is integrated with cell wall synthesis, and illustrates how highly conserved folding machines ensure the functioning of fundamental cellular processes during stress.",

    "abstract": "The sequestration of damaged mitochondria within double-membrane structures termed autophagosomes is a key step of PINK1/Parkin mitophagy. The Atg4 family of proteases are thought to regulate autophagosome formation exclusively by processing the ubiquitin-like Atg8 family (LC3/GABARAPs). We make the unexpected discovery that human Atg4s can directly promote autophagosome formation independently of their protease activity and of Atg8 family processing. High resolution structures of phagophores generated with artificial intelligence-directed 3D electron microscopy reveal a role for the Atg4 family in promoting phagophore-ER contacts during the lipid-transfer phase of autophagosome formation. Atg4 proximity interaction networks stimulated by PINK1/Parkin mitophagy are consistent with roles for Atg4s in protein/vesicle transport and lipid modification. We also show that Atg8 removal during autophagosome maturation does not depend on Atg4 de-lipidation activity as previously thought. Instead, we find that Atg4s can disassemble Atg8-protein conjugates, revealing a role for Atg4s as deubiquitinating-like enzymes. These findings establish non-canonical roles of the Atg4 family beyond the Atg8 lipidation axis and provide an AI driven framework for high-throughput 3D electron microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Trophoblast are extra-embryonic cells that are essential to maintain pregnancy. Human trophoblasts arise from the morula as trophectoderm (TE), which, after implantation, differentiates into cytotrophoblast (CT), syncytiotrophoblast (ST), and extravillous trophoblast (EVT) composing the placenta. Here we show that naive, but not primed, human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) recapitulate trophoblast development. Naive PSC-derived TE and CT (nCT) recreated the human and monkey TE-to-CT transition. nCT self-renewed as CT stem cells and had the characteristics of proliferating villous CT and CT in the cell column of the first trimester. Notably, although primed PSCs differentiated into trophoblast-like cells (pBAP), pBAP were distinct from nCT and human placenta-derived CT stem cells, exhibiting properties consistent of the amnion. Our findings establish an authentic paradigm for human trophoblast development, demonstrating the invaluable properties of naive human PSCs. Our system will provide a platform to study the molecular mechanisms underlying trophoblast development and related diseases.",

Using a time-calibrated molecular phylogeny (mtDNA: mtMutS), we examined the lineage membership of mesophotic gorgonian corals (Octocorallia: Cnidaria) in comparison to shallow and deep-sea lineages of the wider Caribbean-Gulf of Mexico and the Tropical Eastern Pacific. Our results show mesophotic gorgonians originating multiple times from old deep-sea octocoral lineages, whereas shallow-water species comprise younger lineages. The mesophotic gorgonian fauna in the studied areas are related to their zooxanthellate shallow-water counterparts in only two clades (Gorgoniidae and Plexauridae), where the shallow-deep gradient could serve as a driver of diversification. Interestingly, mesophotic clades have diversified faster than either shallow or deep clades. One of this groups with fast diversification is the family Ellisellidae, a major component of the mesophotic gorgonian coral assemblage worldwide.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation predominantly occurs at CG dinucleotides in vertebrate genomes; however, non-CG methylation (mCH) is also detectable in vertebrate tissues, most notably in the nervous system. In mammals it is well established that mCH is targeted to CAC trinucleotides by DNMT3A during nervous system development where it is enriched in gene bodies and associated with transcriptional repression. However, the conservation of developmental mCH accumulation and its deposition by DNMT3A is largely unexplored and has yet to be functionally demonstrated in other vertebrates. In this study, by analyzing DNA methylomes and transcriptomes of zebrafish brains, we identified enrichment of mCH at CAC trinucleotides (mCAC) at defined transposon motifs as well as in developmentally downregulated genes associated with developmental and neural functions. We further generated and analyzed DNA methylomes and transcriptomes of developing zebrafish larvae and demonstrated that, like in mammals, mCH accumulates during post-embryonic brain development. Finally, by employing CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we unraveled a conserved role for Dnmt3a enzymes in developmental mCAC deposition. Overall, this work demonstrates the evolutionary conservation of developmental mCH dynamics and highlights the potential of zebrafish as a model to study mCH regulation and function during normal and perturbed development.",

Recently, histone PARylation factor (HPF1) was shown to be a critical modulator of the activity of PARP1 by facilitating PARylation of histones and redirecting the target amino acid specificity from acidic to serine residues. Here we investigate the mechanism and specific consequences of HPF1-mediated PARylation using nucleosomes as both activators and substrates for PARP1. HPF1 provides that catalytic base Glu284 to substantially redirect PARylation by PARP1 such that the histones in nucleosomes become the primary recipients of PAR chains. Surprisingly, HPF1 partitions most of the reaction product to free ADPR, resulting in much shorter PAR chains compared to reactions in the absence of HPF1. This HPF1-mediated switch from polymerase to hydrolase has important implications for the PARP1-mediated response to DNA damage and raises interesting new questions about the role of intracellular ADPR and depletion of NAD+.",

    "abstract": "Trihexyphenidyl (THP), a non-selective muscarinic receptor (mAChR) antagonist, is commonly used for the treatment of dystonia associated with TOR1A, otherwise known as DYT1 dystonia. A better understanding of the mechanism of action of THP is a critical step in the development of better therapeutics with fewer side effects. We previously found that THP normalizes the deficit in striatal dopamine (DA) release in a mouse model of TOR1A dystonia (Tor1a+/{Delta}E knockin (KI) mice), revealing a plausible mechanism of action for this compound, considering that abnormal DA neurotransmission is consistently associated with many forms of dystonia. However, the mAChR subtype(s) that mediate the rescue of striatal dopamine release remain unclear. In this study we used a combination of pharmacological challenges and cell-type specific mAChR conditional knockout mice of either sex to determine which mAChR subtypes mediate the DA release-enhancing effects of THP. We determined that THP acts in part at M4 mAChR on striatal cholinergic interneurons to rescue DA release in both Tor1a+/+ and Tor1a+/{Delta}E KI mice. Further, we found that the subtype selective M4 antagonist VU6021625 recapitulates the effects of THP. These data implicate a principal role for M4 mAChR located on striatal cholinergic interneurons in the mechanism of action of THP and suggest that subtype selective M4 mAChR antagonists may be effective therapeutics with fewer side effects than THP for the treatment of TOR1A dystonia.",

A promising strategy for increasing productivity uses inducible control systems to switch metabolism from growth to chemical synthesis once a large population of cell factories are generated. However, use of expensive chemical inducers limits scalability of this approach for biotechnological applications. Switching using cheap nutrients is an appealing alternative, but their tightly regulated uptake and consumption again limits scalability. Here, using mathematical models of fatty acid uptake in E. coli as an exemplary case study, we unravel how the cells native regulation and program of induction can be engineered to minimise inducer usage. We show that integrating positive feedback loops into the circuitry creates an irreversible metabolic switch, which, requiring only temporary induction, drastically reduces inducer usage.

    "abstract": "Many bacterial pathogens strictly rely on the activity of type III secretion systems (T3SSs) to secrete and translocate effector proteins in order to establish infection. The central component of T3SSs is the needle complex, a supramolecular machine which assembles a continuous conduit crossing the bacterial envelope and the host cell membrane to allow bacterial effectors to gain entry into the host cell cytoplasm to modulate signal transduction processes. Disruption of this process impairs pathogenicity, providing an avenue for antimicrobial design. However, the molecular principles underlying T3 secretion remain elusive. Here, we report the first structure of an active Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium needle complex engaged with the late effector protein SptP in two functional states, revealing the complete 800[A]-long secretion conduit and unravelling the critical role of the export apparatus (EA) subcomplex in T3 secretion. Unfolded substrates enter the EA through a hydrophilic constriction formed by SpaQ proteins, which enables side chain-independent transport, explaining heterogeneity and structural disorder of signal sequences in T3SS effector proteins. Above, a methionine gasket formed by SpaP proteins functions as a gate that dilates to accommodate substrates but prevents leaky pore formation to maintain the physical boundaries of compartments separated by a biological membrane. Following gate penetration, a moveable SpaR loop first folds up to then act akin to a linear ratchet to steer substrates through the needle complex. Together, these findings establish the molecular basis for substrate translocation through T3SSs, improving our understanding of bacterial pathogenicity and motility of flagellated bacteria, and paves the way for the development of novel concepts combating bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "Current knowledge of the transcriptional regulation of human pluripotency is incomplete, with lack of inter-species conservation observed. Single-cell transcriptomics of human embryos previously enabled us to identify transcription factors, including the zinc-finger protein KLF17, that are enriched in the human epiblast and naive hESCs. Here we show that KLF17 is expressed coincident with the known pluripotency factors NANOG and SOX2 across human blastocyst development. We investigate the function of KLF17 in pluripotency using primed and naive hESCs for gain- and loss-of-function analyses. We find that ectopic expression of KLF17 in primed hESCs is sufficient to induce a naive-like transcriptome and that KLF17 can drive transgene-mediated resetting to naive pluripotency. This implies a role for KLF17 in establishing naive pluripotency. However, CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout studies reveal that KLF17 is not required for naive pluripotency acquisition in vitro. Transcriptome analysis of naive hESCs identifies subtle effects on metabolism and signalling following KLF17 loss of function, and possible redundancy with the related factor, KLF5. Overall, we show that KLF17 is sufficient, but not necessary, for naive pluripotency under the given in vitro conditions.\n\nSummary statementInvestigating KLF17 in human pluripotency reveals that it is sufficient, but not necessary, to establish naive hESCs.

    "abstract": "BackgroundApaH like phosphatases (ALPHs) originate from the bacterial ApaH protein and are present in eukaryotes of all eukaryotic super-groups; still, only two proteins have been functionally characterised. One is ALPH1 from the Kinetoplastid Trypanosoma brucei that we recently found to be the mRNA decapping enzyme of the parasite. mRNA decapping by ALPHs is unprecedented in eukaryotes, which usually use nudix hydrolases, but the bacterial ancestor protein ApaH was recently found to decap non-conventional caps of bacterial mRNAs. These findings prompted us to explore whether mRNA decapping by ALPHs is restricted to Kinetoplastida or more widespread among eukaryotes.\n\nResultsWe screened 824 eukaryotic proteomes with a newly developed Python-based algorithm for the presence of ALPHs and used the data to refine phylogenetic distribution, conserved features, additional domains and predicted intracellular localisation of ALPHs. We found that most eukaryotes have either no ALPH (500/824) or very short ALPHs, consisting almost exclusively of the catalytic domain. These ALPHs had mostly predicted non-cytoplasmic localisations, often supported by the presence of transmembrane helices and signal peptides and in two cases (one in this study) by experimental data. The only exceptions were ALPH1 homologues from Kinetoplastida, that all have unique C-terminal and mostly unique N-terminal extension, and at least the T. brucei enzyme localises to the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, despite of these non-cytoplasmic localisations, ALPHs from all eukaryotic super-groups had in vitro mRNA decapping activity.\n\nConclusionsALPH was present in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes, but most eukaryotes have either lost the enzyme since, or use it exclusively outside the cytoplasm in organelles in a version consisting of the catalytic domain only. While our data provide no evidence for the presence of further mRNA decapping enzymes among eukaryotic ALPHs, the broad substrate range of ALPHs that includes mRNA caps provides an explanation for the selection against the presence of a cytoplasmic ALPH protein as a mean to protect mRNAs from unregulated degradation. Kinetoplastida succeeded to exploit ALPH as their mRNA decapping enzyme, likely using the Kinetoplastida-unique N- and C-terminal extensions for regulation.",

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multispectral imagery is widely used for high-throughput phenotyping because it can rapidly predict crop vigor. This paper mainly studied the potential of multispectral images obtained by low-altitude UAV systems in predicting canopy nitrogen (N) content and irrigation level for sugarcane.\n\nMethodsAn experiment was carried out on sugarcane fields with three irrigation levels and five nitrogen levels. A multispectral image at a height of 40 m was acquired during the elongation stage, and the canopy nitrogen content was determined as the ground truth. N prediction models, including partial least square (PLS), backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) models, were established based on different variables. A support vector machine (SVM) model was used to recognize the irrigation level.\n\nResultsThe PLS model based on band reflectance and five vegetation indices had better accuracy (R=0.7693, root mean square error (RMSE)=0.1109) than the BPNN and ELM models. Some spectral information from the multispectral image had obviously different features among the different irrigation levels, and the SVM algorithm was used for irrigation level classification. The classification accuracy reached 77.8%.\n\nConclusionLow-altitude multispectral images could provide effective information for N prediction and water irrigation level recognition.",

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is commonly understood as a network disorder, yet case-control analyses against typically-developing controls (TD) have yielded somewhat inconsistent patterns of results. The current work was centered on a novel approach to profile functional network idiosyncrasy, the inter-individual variability in the association between functional network organization and brain anatomy, and we tested the hypothesis that idiosyncrasy contributes to connectivity alterations in ASD. Studying functional network idiosyncrasy in a multi-centric dataset with 157 ASD and 172 TD, our approach revealed higher idiosyncrasy in ASD in the default mode, somatomotor and attention networks together with reduced idiosyncrasy in the lateral temporal lobe. Idiosyncrasy was found to increase with age in both ASD and TD, and was significantly correlated with symptom severity in the former group. Association analysis with structural and molecular brain features indicated that patterns of functional network idiosyncrasy were not correlated with ASD-related cortical thickness alterations, but closely with the spatial expression patterns of intracortical ASD risk genes. In line with our main hypothesis, we could demonstrate that idiosyncrasy indeed plays a strong role in the manifestation of connectivity alterations that are measurable with conventional case-control designs and may, thus, be a principal driver of inconsistency in the autism connectomics literature. These findings support important interactions between the heterogeneity of individuals with an autism diagnosis and group-level functional signatures, and help to consolidate prior research findings on the highly variable nature of the functional connectome in ASD. Our study promotes idiosyncrasy as a potential individualized diagnostic marker of atypical brain network development.",

    "abstract": "Tall fescue KY-31 feeds ~20% of the beef cattle in the United States. It carries a fungal endophyte that produces ergovaline, which causes toxicosis in cattle, leading to $2 billion revenue loss annually. The MaxQ cultivar of the grass is non-toxic, but less attractive economically. To develop ways of mitigating the toxicity, the rumen microbiome of cattle consuming KY-31 and MaxQ have been analyzed, principally for identifying ergovaline transforming microorganisms and often using fecal microbiome as a surrogate. We have hypothesized that KY-31 not only causes toxicosis, but also impacts rumen metabolism broadly, and tested the hypothesis by analyzing rumen microbiome compositions of cattle that grazed MaxQ with an intervening KY-31 grazing period with 16S rRNA-V4 element as identifier. We found that KY-31 remodeled the cellulolytic and saccharolytic communities substantially. This effect was not evident at whole microbiome levels but in the compositions of sessile and planktonic fractions. A move from MaxQ to KY-31 lowered the Firmicutes abundance in the sessile fraction and increased it in planktonic part and caused an opposite effect for Bacteroidetes, although the total abundances of these dominant rumen organisms remained unchanged. In the sessile fraction, the abundances of Fibrobacter, which degrades less degradable fibers, and certain cellulolytic Firmicutes such as Pseudobutyrivibrio and Butyrivibrio 2, dropped, and these losses were apparently compensated by increased occurrences of Eubacterium and specific Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. In planktonic fraction the Tenericutes abundance increased as saccharolytic Bacteroidetes level dropped. Several potential ergovaline degraders were enriched. A return to MaxQ restored the original Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes distributions. However, the Fibrobacter and Butyrivibrio 2 abundances remained low and their substitutes maintained significant presence. The rumen microbiome was influenced minimally by animals fescue toxicosis and was distinct from previously reported fecal microbiomes in composition. In summary, KY-31 and MaxQ cultivars of tall fescue were digested in the cattle rumen with distinct consortia and the KY-31-specific features were dominant. The study highlighted the importance of analyzing sessile and planktonic fractions separately.",

Understanding the aetiology of disorder emergence and recovery is important for establishing preventative measures and optimising treatment. Experimental approaches can serve as a useful model for disorder and recovery relevant processes. One such model is fear conditioning. We conducted a remote fear conditioning paradigm in monozygotic and dizygotic twins to determine the degree and extent of overlap between genetic and environmental influences on fear acquisition and extinction.\n\nMethods1937 twins aged 22-25 years, including 538 complete pairs from the Twins Early Development Study (TEDS) took part in a fear conditioning experiment delivered remotely via the Fear Learning and Anxiety Response (FLARe) smartphone app.\n\nIn the fear acquisition phase participants were exposed to two neutral shape stimuli, one of which was repeatedly paired with a loud aversive noise, while the other was never paired with anything aversive. In the extinction phase the shapes were repeatedly presented again, this time without the aversive noise. Outcomes were participant ratings of how much they expected the aversive noise to occur when they saw either shape, throughout each phase.\n\nResultsTwin analyses indicated a significant contribution of genetic effects to the initial acquisition and consolidation of fear, and the extinction of fear (15%, 30% and 15% respectively) with the remainder of variance due to the non-shared environment. Multivariate analyses revealed that the development of fear and fear extinction show moderate genetic overlap (genetic correlations .4-.5).\n\nConclusionsFear acquisition and extinction are heritable, and share some, but not all of the same genetic influences.",

    "abstract": "Animals in urban areas that experience frequent exposure to humans often behave differently than those in less urban areas, such as exhibiting less vigilance or anti-predator behavior. These behavioral shifts may be an adaptive response to urbanization, but it may be costly if animals in urban areas also exhibit reduced anti-predator behavior in the presence of natural predators. In trials with only a human observer as the stimulus, urban squirrels exhibited reduced vigilance and anti-predator behavior compared to those in less urban areas. Next, we exposed squirrels in multiple urban and less urban sites to acoustic playbacks of a control stimulus (non-predatory bird calls), a natural predator (hawk), and dogs and recorded their vigilance and three different anti-predator behaviors when a human approached them while either broadcasting one of these three playbacks or no playbacks at all. Squirrels at urban sites also did not differ in their behavioral responses to the playbacks from possible predators (hawks or dogs) when they were compared to those at less urban sites exposed to these playbacks. Urban squirrels also exhibited increased vigilance and anti-predator behavior when exposed to a human paired with hawk playbacks compared to the control playbacks. Together, our results indicate that urban squirrels did perceive and assess risk to the natural predator appropriately despite exhibiting increased tolerance to humans. These results provide little support for the hypothesis that increased tolerance to humans causes animals to lose their fear of natural predators.",

This context specificity confounds our understanding of genetics and cell biology. 2 large collections of pooled CRISPR screens offer an exciting opportunity to explore cell specificity. One explanation, synthetic lethality, occurs when a single \"private\" mutation creates a unique genetic dependency. However, by fitting thousands of machine learning models across millions of omic and CRISPR features, we discovered a \"public\" genetic architecture that is common across cell lines and explains more context specificity than synthetic lethality. This common architecture is built on CRISPR loss-of-function phenotypes that are surprisingly predictive of other loss-of-function phenotypes. Using these insights and inspired by the in silico lossy compression of images, we use machine learning to identify small \"lossy compression\" sets of in vitro CRISPR constructs where reduced measurements produce genome-scale loss-of-function predictions.",

Whether or not heterogeneity at the neural level plays a functional role remains unclear, and has been relatively little explored in models which are often highly homogeneous. We compared the performance of spiking neural networks trained to carry out tasks of real-world difficulty, with varying degrees of heterogeneity, and found that it substantially improved task performance. Learning was more stable and robust, particularly for tasks with a rich temporal structure. In addition, the distribution of neuronal parameters in the trained networks closely matches those observed experimentally. We suggest that the heterogeneity observed in the brain may be more than just the byproduct of noisy processes, but rather may serve an active and important role in allowing animals to learn in changing environments.\n\nSummaryNeural heterogeneity is metabolically efficient for learning, and optimal parameter distribution matches experimental data.",

However, expression and activity on endogenous substrates in the brain may underlie a constitutive role of these enzymes beyond drug metabolism. CYP2C19, which is expressed in the human fetal brain during neurodevelopment, shows affinity for endogenous compounds including monoaminergic neurotransmitters, steroid hormones, and endocannabinoids. In this study (N=608), we looked at the genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 and its potential associations with structural phenotypes of subcortical brain volume with structural imaging. Using two independent volume estimation techniques, we found converging evidence for a positive association between CYP2C19 activity scores, as inferred from the genotype, and basal ganglia and hippocampal volume. This association was present only in female individuals, raising the possibility that effects on brain morphology may arise through a mechanism involving the metabolism of estrogen steroids.",

By mRNA display, we showed that 73% of ADs bound the Med15 subunit of Mediator, and that binding strength was correlated with activation. AD-Mediator interaction in vitro was unaffected by a large excess of free activator protein, pointing to a dynamic mechanism of interaction. Structural modeling showed that ADs interact with Med15 without shape complementarity (\"fuzzy\" binding). ADs shared no sequence motifs, but mutagenesis revealed biochemical and structural constraints. Finally, a neural network trained on AD sequences accurately predicted ADs in human proteins and in other yeast proteins, including chromosomal proteins and chromatin remodeling complexes.

    "abstract": "Structural defects in cilia have robust effects in diverse tissues and systems. However, how ciliary length changes influence signaling output are unknown. Here, we examined the functional role of a ciliary length control mechanism whereby FBW7-mediated destruction of NDE1 positively regulated ciliary length, in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation. We show that FBW7 functions as a master regulator of both negative (NDE1) and positive (TALPID3) regulators of ciliogenesis, with an overall positive net effect on cilia formation, MSC differentiation, and bone architecture. Deletion of Fbxw7 suppresses ciliation, Hedgehog activity, and differentiation, which are rescued in Fbxw7/Nde1-null cells. However, despite formation of abnormally long cilia in Nde1-null cells, MSC differentiation is suppressed. NDE1 promotes MSC differentiation by increasing the activity of the Hedgehog pathway by direct binding and enhancing GLI2 activity in a cilia-independent manner. We propose that ciliary structure-function coupling is determined by intricate interactions of structural and functional proteins.",

    "abstract": "Inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the inositol phosphate (IP) pathway which converts IP3 to IP4 and IP5. In mammalian cells, IPMK can also act as a phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3-kinase). We previously found that IPMK is a critical PI3-kinase activator of AKT. Here, we show that IPMK mediates AKT activation by promoting membrane localization and activation of PDK1. The PI3-kinase activity of IPMK is dispensable for membrane localization of AKT, which is entirely controlled by classical PI3-kinase (p110,{beta},{gamma} , {delta}). By contrast, we found that PDK1 membrane localization was largely independent of classical PI3-kinase. Membrane localization of PDK1 stimulates cell migration by dissociating ROCK1 from inhibitory binding to RhoE and promoting ROCK1-mediated myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation. Deletion of IPMK impairs cell migration associated with the abolition of PDK1-mediated ROCK1 disinhibition and subsequent MLC phosphorylation. To investigate the physiological relevance of IPMK-mediated AKT activation, we generated mice selectively lacking IPMK in epithelial cells of the intestine, where IPMK is highly expressed. Deletion of IPMK in intestinal epithelial cells markedly reduced AKT phosphorylation and diminished numbers of Paneth cells - a crypt-resident epithelial cell type that generates the physiological niche for intestinal stem cells. Ablation of IPMK impaired intestinal epithelial cell regeneration basally and after; chemotherapy-induced damage, suggesting a broad role for IPMK in the activation of AKT and intestinal tissue regeneration. In summary, the PI3-kinase activity of IPMK promotes membrane localization of PDK1, a critical kinase whereby AKT maintains intestinal homeostasis.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPI3-kinase activity of IPMK is essential for activation of AKT.",

Nevertheless, paternal leakage often occurs in plants, fungi, protists and animals, and this leaves the possibility that heteroplasmy can in some contexts be advantageous. Theoretical models developed in the past revealed that maternal inheritance improves selection against deleterious mitochondrial mutations, but none of them have explained the observed variation in the extent of paternal leakage. Here we show that paternal leakage regulated by nuclear loci can evolve to maintain advantageous organelle diversity in fluctuating environments. Strict maternal inheritance reduces organelle variance within the cell, but this loss of diversity can be detrimental when environments are shifting rapidly. Our model reveals that high levels of paternal leakage can evolve in these types of rapidly changing environments and that strict maternal inheritance evolves only when the environment is changing slowly.\n\nDataMatlab/Octave implementation of the model is available at Https://github.com/StochasticBiology/PaternalLeakageEvolution.",

    "abstract": "Anisogamy has evolved in a large proportion of sexually reproducing multicellular organisms allowing the definition of the female and male sexes, producing large and small gametes, respectively. Anisogamy is the initial sexual dimorphism: it has lead the sexes to experience selection differently, which makes it a good starting point to understand the evolution of further sexual dimorphisms. For instance, it is generally accepted that anisogamy sets the stage for more intense intrasexual competition in the male sex than in the female sex. However, we argue that this idea may rely on assumptions on the conditions under which anisogamy has evolved in the first place. We consider here two widely accepted scenarios for the evolution of anisogamy: gamete competition or gamete limitation. We present a mechanistic mathematical model in which both gamete size and an intrasexual competition trait for fertilisation can coevolve in a population starting without dimorphism between its two mating types. Two different intrasexual competition traits are investigated, gamete motility and the ability of gametes to capture gametes of the opposite mating type. We show that gamete competition and gamete limitation can lead to greatly different outcomes in terms of which sex competes most for fertilisation. Our results suggest that gamete competition is most likely to lead to stronger competition in males. On the other hand, under gamete limitation, competition in form of motility can evolve in either sex while gamete capture mainly evolves in females. This study suggests that anisogamy does not per se lead to more intense male competition. The conditions under which anisogamy evolves matter, as well as the competition trait considered.",

In this study we determined the calibration curves for foragers of the two Asian honey bee species, A. florea and A. cerana, in two different natural environments with clear differences in the vegetation conditions and hence visual contrast. We found that the dense vegetation condition (with higher contrast) elicited a more rapid increase in the waggle phase duration with distance than the sparse vegetation in A. florea but not in A. cerana. Visual contrast did not affect the perception of the food reward, measured as the number of dance circuits produced per distance, in both species.

These advances are achieved by exploiting a novel flow regime in ladder microfluidic networks that, under appropriate conditions, yield a mathematically perfect cell trap. Machine learning and computer vision tools are used to control the imaging hardware and analyze the cellular phenotypic parameters within these images. Using this platform, we quantified the responses of tens of thousands of single cell-derived acute myeloid leukemia (AML) clones to targeted therapy, identifying rare resistance and morphological phenotypes at frequencies down to 0.05%.

Two biotinylated TASQs, BioTASQ and BioCyTASQ, are indeed efficient molecular tools to fish out G4s of mixtures of nucleic acids through simple affinity capture protocols and to image G4s in cells via a biotin/avidin pretargeted imaging system first applied here to G4s, found to be a reliable alternative to in situ click chemistry.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/422878v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2db02dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1897e59org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c63716org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4a8a5d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc) is important for synaptic scaling and the normal function of the brain. Arc interacts with many neuronal postsynaptic proteins, but the mechanistic details of its function have not been fully established. The C-terminal domain of Arc consists of tandem domains, termed the N- and C-lobe. The N-lobe harbours a peptide binding site, able to bind to multiple targets. By measuring the affinity of various peptides towards human Arc, we have refined the specificity determinants of this site. We found two sites in the GKAP repeat region that may bind to Arc and confirmed these interactions by X-ray crystallography. Comparison of the crystal structures of three human Arc-peptide complexes identifies 3 conserved C-H...{pi} interactions at the binding cavity, which explain the sequence specificity of short linear motif binding by Arc. By analysing the structures, we further characterise central residues of the Arc lobe fold, show the effects of peptide binding on protein dynamics, and identify acyl carrier proteins as structures similar to the Arc lobes. We hypothesise that Arc may affect protein-protein interactions and phase separation at the postsynaptic density, affecting protein turnover and re-modelling of the synapse.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of gene expression plays an important role in cancer development. Identifying transcriptional regulators, including transcription factors and chromatin regulators, that drive the oncogenic gene expression program is a critical task in cancer research. Genomic profiles of active transcriptional regulators from primary cancer samples are limited in the public domain. Here we present BART Cancer (bartcancer.org), an interactive web resource database to display the putative transcriptional regulators that are responsible for differentially regulated genes in 15 different cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). BART Cancer integrates over 10,000 gene expression profiling RNA-seq datasets from TCGA with over 7,000 ChIP-seq datasets from the Cistrome Data Browser database and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). BART Cancer uses Binding Analysis for Regulation of Transcription (BART) for predicting the transcriptional regulators from the differentially expressed genes in cancer samples compared to normal samples. BART Cancer also displays the activities of over 900 transcriptional regulators across cancer types, by integrating computational prediction results from BART and the Cistrome Cancer database. Focusing on transcriptional regulator activities in human cancers, BART Cancer can provide unique insights into epigenetics and transcriptional regulation in cancer, and is a useful data resource for genomics and cancer research communities.",

However, current differentiation therapies are effective only to specific patient populations. To identify novel differentiation agents with wider efficacy, we developed a phenotypic high-throughput screen with a range of genetically diverse cell lines. From the resulting hits, one chemical scaffold was optimised in terms of activity and physicochemical properties to yield OXS007417, which was also able to decrease tumour volume in a murine in vivo xenograft model.",
