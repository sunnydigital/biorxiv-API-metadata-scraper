    "abstract": "Longitudinal mouse models are commonly used to study possible causal factors associated with human health and disease. However, the statistical models, such as two-way ANOVA, often applied in these studies do not appropriately model the experimental design, resulting in biased and imprecise results. Here, we describe the linear mixed effects (LME) model and how to use it for longitudinal mice studies. We re-analyze a dataset published by Blanton et al (Science 2016) that modeled mice growth trajectories after microbiome implantation from nourished or malnourished children. We compare the fit and stability of different parameterizations of ANOVA and LME models; most models found the nourished vs. malnourished growth trajectories differed significantly. We show through simulation that the results from the two-way ANOVA and LME models are not always consistent. Incorrectly modeling correlated data can result in increased rates of false positives or false negatives, supporting the need to model correlated data correctly. We provide an interactive Shiny App to enable accessible and appropriate analysis of longitudinal data using LME models.",

    "abstract": "Recent single-cell multi-modal data reveal multi-scale characteristics of single cells, such as transcriptomics, morphology, and electrophysiology. However, our understanding of functional genomics and gene regulation leading to various cellular characteristics remains elusive. To address this, we applied multiple machine learning methods to align gene expression and electrophysiological data of single neuronal cells in the mouse brain. We found that nonlinear manifold learning outperforms other methods. After manifold alignment, the cell clusters highly correspond to transcriptomic and morphological cell-types, suggesting a strong nonlinear relationship between gene expression and electrophysiology at the cell-type level. The aligned cells form developmental trajectories and show continuous changes of electrophysiological features, implying the underlying developmental process. We also found that the manifold-aligned cell clusters differentially expressed genes can predict many electrophysiological features. Functional enrichment and gene regulatory network analyses for those cell clusters revealed potential genome functions and molecular mechanisms from gene expression to neuronal electrophysiology.",

    "abstract": "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is one of the largest biorepositories of digital histology. Deep learning (DL) models have been trained on TCGA to predict numerous features directly from histology, including survival, gene expression patterns, and driver mutations. However, we demonstrate that these features vary substantially across tissue submitting sites in TCGA for over 3,000 patients with six cancer subtypes. Additionally, we show that histologic image differences between submitting sites can easily be identified with DL. This site detection remains possible despite commonly used color normalization and augmentation methods, and we quantify the digital image characteristics constituting this histologic batch effect. As an example, we show that patient ethnicity within the TCGA breast cancer cohort can be inferred from histology due to site-level batch effect, which must be accounted for to ensure equitable application of DL. Batch effect also leads to overoptimistic estimates of model performance, and we propose a quadratic programming method to guide validation that abrogates this bias.",

A large amount of information about associations between variants and diseases used by curators and researchers for interpreting variant pathogenicity is buried in biomedical literature. The development of text-mining tools that can extract relevant information from the literature will speed up and assist the variant interpretation curation process. In this work, we present a text-mining tool, MACE2k that extracts evidence sentences containing associations between variants and diseases from full-length PMC Open Access articles. We use different machine learning models (classical and deep learning) to identify evidence sentences with variant-disease associations. Evaluation shows promising results with the best F1-score of 82.9% and AUC-ROC of 73.9%. Classical ML models had a better recall (96.6% for Random Forest) compared to deep learning models. The deep learning model, Convolutional Neural Network had the best precision (75.6%), which is essential for any curation task.",

    "abstract": "In this work, we present a single-pole magnetic tweezers (MT) device designed for integration with substrate deformation tracking microscopy (DTM) and/or traction force microscopy (TFM) experiments intended to explore extracellular matrix rheology and human epidermal keratinocyte mechanobiology. Assembled from commercially available off-the-shelf electronics hardware and software, the MT device is amenable to replication in the basic biology laboratory. In contrast to conventional solenoid current-controlled MT devices, operation of this instrument is based on real-time feedback control of the magnetic flux density emanating from the blunt end of the needle core using a cascade control scheme and a digital proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. Algorithms that compensate for an apparent spatially non-uniform remnant magnetization of the needle core that develops during actuation are implemented into the feedback control scheme. Through optimization of PID gain scheduling, the MT device exhibits magnetization and demagnetization response times of less than 100 ms without overshoot over a wide range of magnetic flux density setpoints. Compared to current-based control, magnetic flux density-based control allows for more accurate and precise magnetic actuation forces by compensating for temperature increases within the needle core due to heat generated by the applied solenoid currents. Near field calibrations validate the ability of the MT device to actuate 4.5 m-diameter superparamagnetic beads with forces up to 25 nN with maximum relative uncertainties of {+/-}30% for beads positioned between 2.5 and 40 m from the needle tip.",

    "abstract": "In this work we demonstrate the integration of magnetic tweezers (MT) with substrate deformation tracking microscopy (DTM) and traction force microscopy (TFM) for the investigation of extracellular matrix rheology and human epidermal keratinocyte mechanobiology in the context of human blistering skin diseases. Two model bead-on-gel experiments are described in which an MT device is used to apply a prescribed force or displacement waveform to a fibronectin-coated superparamagnetic bead attached to a type I collagen gel containing a layer of covalently attached red-fluorescent microspheres. Serial fast time-lapse DIC and epifluorescence image acquisitions are used to capture displacements of the bead and microspheres, respectively, in response to the applied force or displacement. Due to the large number of acquired images and the dynamic behavior of substrate microspheres observed during the experiment, new quantitative methods are developed for the tracking and filtering of microsphere displacement data, the selection of L2 regularization parameters used for TFM analysis, and the identification of time intervals within the overall image set that can be approximated as being subject to elastostatic conditions. Two major proof-of-concept applications are described in which integrated MT-DTM/TFM experiments are used to (i) estimate the elastic properties of a fibrillar type I collagen gel substrate and (ii) demonstrate how a force applied to a focal adhesion contact on the apical surface of a living keratinocyte is directly transmitted to basal cell-matrix anchoring junctions as observed by substrate deformations and incremental traction stresses that develop within the collagen subjacent to the cell.",

    "abstract": "Experimental evidence has demonstrated the potential of transient pulses of electric fields to alter mammalian cell phenotypes. Strategies with these pulsed electric fields (PEFs) have been developed for clinical applications in cancer therapeutics, in-vivo decellularization, and tissue regeneration. Successful implementation of these strategies involves understanding how PEFs impact the cellular structures and, hence, cell behavior. The caveat, however, is that the PEF parameter space comprised of different pulse widths, amplitudes, and the number of pulses is very large, and design of experiments to explore all possible combinations of PEF parameters is prohibitive from a cost and time standpoint. In this study, a scaling law based on the Ising model is introduced to understand the impact of PEFs on the outer cell lipid membrane so that an understanding developed in one PEF pulse regime may be extended to another. Experimental study is used to argue for the scaling model. Next, the validity of this scaling model to predict the behavior of both thermally quenched and electrically perturbed lipid membranes is demonstrated via computational predictions made by the steepest-entropy-ascent quantum thermodynamic (SEAQT) framework. Based on the simulation results, a form of scaled PEF parameters is thus proposed for lipid membrane.",

    "abstract": "MLL-rearranged leukemia depends on H3K79 methylation. Depletion of this transcriptionally-activating mark by DOT1L deletion or high concentrations of the inhibitor pinometostat downregulates HOXA9 and MEIS1, and consequently reduces leukemia survival. Yet some MLL-rearranged leukemias are inexplicably susceptible to low-dose pinometostat, far below concentrations that downregulate this canonical proliferation pathway. In this context, we define alternative proliferation pathways that more directly derive from H3K79me2 loss. By ICeChIP-seq, H3K79me2 is markedly depleted at pinometostat-downregulated and MLL-fusion targets, with paradoxical increases of H3K4me3 and loss of H3K27me3. Although downregulation of polycomb components accounts for some of the proliferation defect, transcriptional downregulation of FLT3 is the major pathway. Loss-of-FLT3-function recapitulates the cytotoxicity and gene expression consequences of low-dose pinometostat, whereas overexpression of constitutively active STAT5A, a target of FLT3-ITD-signalling, largely rescues these defects. This pathway also depends on MLL1, indicating combinations of DOT1L, MLL1 and FLT3 inhibitors should be explored for treating FLT3-mutant leukemia.",

    "abstract": "Complex somatic genomic rearrangement and copy number alterations (CNA) are hallmarks of nearly all cancers. Whilst whole genome sequencing (WGS) in principle allows comprehensive profiling of these events, biological and clinical interpretation remains challenging. We have developed LINX, a novel algorithm which allows interpretation of short-read paired-end WGS derived structural variant and CNA data by clustering raw structural variant calls into distinct events, predicting their impact on the local structure of the derivative chromosome, and annotating their functional impact on affected genes. Novel visualisations facilitate further investigation of complex genomic rearrangements. We show that LINX provides insights into a diverse range of structural variation events including single and double break-junction events, mobile element insertions, complex shattering and high amplification events. We demonstrate that LINX can reliably detect a wide range of pathogenic rearrangements including gene fusions, immunoglobulin enhancer rearrangements, intragenic deletions and duplications. Uniquely, LINX also predicts chained fusions which we demonstrate account for 13% of clinically relevant oncogenic fusions. LINX also reports a class of inactivation events we term homozygous disruptions which may be a driver mutation in up to 8.8% of tumors including frequently affecting PTEN, TP53 and RB1, and are likely missed by many standard WGS analysis pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Low-velocity motor vehicle crashes frequently induce chronic neck disorders also referred to as whiplash-associated disorders (WAD). The etiology of WAD is still not fully understood. Women are affected more often and more severely than men. A frontal-oblique collision direction leads to WAD relatively frequently, but is poorly investigated as compared to rear-end or frontal collision directions. An oblique impact direction is assumed to strain the contralateral neck side more than the ipsilateral side, provoking an asymmetrical response pattern of the left and right cervical muscles. In this study, we examined the muscle reflex responses of the sternocleidomastoid, the paraspinal, and the trapezius muscles as well as the kinematic responses of 60 subjects during left-frontal-oblique collisions. Neither the reflex delay nor the peak head acceleration revealed significant sex differences. Thus, the elsewhere reported higher injury risk of females as compared to males cannot be explained by the electromyographic and kinematic results of this study. In females as well as in males the right muscle responses revealed shorter onset times than the left muscle responses. Thus, cervical muscles seem to be activated depending on the specific direction of the impact. Moreover, the difference between right and left muscle responses cannot be explained by a startle reflex. The movement of the head in relation to the torso (female mean {+/-} SD: 92 {+/-} 16 ms; male: 87 {+/-} 16 ms) started almost simultaneously to the onset of the first muscle activation (right paraspinal muscles: female mean: 95 ms and 95%-CI 82 - 109; male mean: 95 ms and 95%-CI 84 - 108) indicating that the initial muscle activity seems not to be triggered by a stretch reflex in the PARA muscles.",

    "abstract": "Reptiles are the most species-rich vertebrate group with a broad diversity of life history traits. Biotelemetry is an essential methodology for reptiles as it compensates for several limitations when studying their natural history. We evaluated trends in reptile spatial ecology studies focusing upon quantifying home ranges for the past twenty years. We assessed 290 English-language reptile home range studies published from 2000-2019 via a structured literature review investigating publications study location, taxonomic group, methodology, reporting, and analytical techniques. Substantial biases remain in both location and taxonomic groups in the literature, with nearly half of all studies (45%) originating from the USA. Snakes were most often studied, and crocodiles were least often studied, while testudines tended to have the greatest within study sample sizes. More than half of all studies lacked critical methodological details, limiting the number of studies for inclusion in future meta-analyses (55% of studies lacked information on individual tracking durations, and 51% lacked sufficient information on the number of times researchers recorded positions). Studies continue to rely on outdated methods to quantify space-use (including Minimum Convex Polygons and Kernel Density Estimators), often failing to report subtleties on decisions that have substantial impact on home range area estimates. Moving forward researchers can select a suite of appropriate analytical techniques tailored to their research question (dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models for within sample interpolation, and autocorrelated Kernel Density Estimators for beyond sample extrapolation). Only 1.4% of all evaluated studies linked to available and usable telemetry data, further hindering scientific consensus. We ultimately implore herpetologists to adopt transparent reporting practices and make liberal use of open data platforms to maximize progress in the field of reptile spatial ecology.",

The purpose of this study was to determine if the response to iTMS is influenced by different interstimulus intervals (ISIs) targeting late I-waves, and whether these responses were associated with individual variations in intracortical excitability. 17 young (27.2 {+/-} 6.4 years, 12 females) healthy adults received iTMS at late I-wave intervals (4.0, 4.5 & 5.0 ms) in three separate sessions. Changes due to each intervention were examined with motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes and short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) using both posterior-anterior (PA) and anterior-posterior (AP) TMS current directions. Changes in MEP amplitude and SICF were influenced by iTMS ISI, with the greatest facilitation for ISIs at 4 and 5 ms with PA TMS, and 4 ms with AP TMS. Maximum SICF at baseline (irrespective of ISI) was associated with increased iTMS response, but only for PA stimulation. These results suggest that modifying iTMS parameters targeting late I-waves can influence M1 plasticity. They also suggest that maximum SICF may be a means by which responders to iTMS targeting the late I-waves could be identified.",

    "abstract": "The occipital face area (OFA) is hierarchically one of the first stages of the face processing network. It has originally been thought to be involved in early, structural processing steps, but currently more and more studies challenge this view and propose that it also takes part in higher face processing, such as identification and recognition. Here we tested whether the OFA is involved in the initial steps of recognition memory and plays a causal role in the differential processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces. We used an offline, inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol over the right OFA and the vertex as control site. An electroencephalographic (EEG) recording of event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited by visually presented familiar (famous) and unfamiliar faces was performed before and after stimulation. We observed a difference in ERPs for famous and unfamiliar faces in a time-window corresponding to the N250 component. Importantly, this difference was significantly increased by cTBS of the right OFA, suggesting its causal role in the differential processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces. The enhancement occurred focally, at electrodes close to the right hemispheric cTBS site, as well as over similar occipito-temporal sites of the contralateral hemisphere. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the causal role of the rOFA in the differential processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces, using combined cTBS and EEG recording methods. These results are discussed with respect to the nature of familiar face representations, supported by an extensive, bilateral network.",

    "abstract": "Dynamical modeling of the resting-state brain dynamics essentially relies on the empirical neuroimaging data utilized for the model derivation and validation. There is however still no standardized data processing for magnetic resonance imaging pipelines and the structural and functional connectomes involved in the models. In this study, we thus address how the parameters of diffusion-weighted data processing for structural connectivity (SC) can influence the validation results of the whole-brain mathematical models and search for the optimal parameter settings. On this way, we simulate the functional connectivity by systems of coupled oscillators, where the underlying network is constructed from the empirical SC and evaluate the performance of the models for varying parameters of data processing. For this, we introduce a set of simulation conditions including the varying number of total streamlines of the whole-brain tractography (WBT) used for extraction of SC, cortical parcellations based on functional and anatomical brain properties and distinct model fitting modalities. We observed that the graph-theoretical network properties of structural connectome can be affected by varying tractography density and strongly relate to the model performance. We explored free parameters of the considered models and found the optimal parameter configurations, where the model dynamics closely replicates the empirical data. We also found that the optimal number of the total streamlines of WBT can vary for different brain atlases. Consequently, we suggest a way how to improve the model performance based on the network properties and the optimal parameter configurations from multiple WBT conditions. Furthermore, the population of subjects can be stratified into subgroups with divergent behaviors induced by the varying number of WBT streamlines such that different recommendations can be made with respect to the data processing for individual subjects and brain parcellations.\n\nAuthor summaryThe human brain connectome at macro level provides an anatomical constitution of inter-regional connections through the white matter in the brain. Understanding the brain dynamics grounded on the structural architecture is one of the most studied and important topics actively debated in the neuroimaging research. However, the ground truth for the adequate processing and reconstruction of the human brain connectome in vivo is absent, which is crucial for evaluation of the results of the data-driven as well as model-based approaches to brain investigation. In this study we thus evaluate the effect of the whole-brain tractography density on the structural brain architecture by varying the number of total axonal fiber streamlines. The obtained results are validated throughout the dynamical modeling of the resting-state brain dynamics. We found that the tractography density may strongly affect the graph-theoretical network properties of the structural connectome. The obtained results also show that a dense whole-brain tractography is not always the best condition for the modeling, which depends on a selected brain parcellation used for the calculation of the structural connectivity and derivation of the model network. Our findings provide suggestions for the optimal data processing for neuroimaging research and brain modeling.",

    "abstract": "Kisspeptin-expressing neurons in the rostral periventricular region of the third ventricle (RP3V) play an essential role in female reproduction. However, adult male mice were reported to have very few Kisspeptin-expressing neurons in the RP3V compared to females. This led to the hypothesis that Kiss1RP3V neurons are responsible for the ability of females, but not males, to generate a surge of LH, triggering ovulation and steroid synthesis in the female. Using mouse genetics and cell type-specific gene expression analysis, we show that male mice harbor almost as many Kiss1RP3V neurons as the female and that gene expression in these neurons is very similar. Specific activation of male Kiss1RP3V neurons expressing viral-encoded hM3Dq caused a surge in serum testosterone levels. These results demonstrate that Kiss1RP3V neurons are present in the adult male and fully capable of regulating the hypothalamic/pituitary/gonadal axis. We suggest that these neurons may continue to play a role in reproductive behavior in adult male mice.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, which is catalyzed by the adenosine deaminase RNA-specific family of enzymes, is a frequent post-transcriptional modification in metazoans. Research on A-to-I editing in bacteria is limited, and the importance is underestimated. In this study, we show that bacteria may use A-to-I editing as an alternative strategy to promote uptake of metabolic iron. The T408A editing event of xfeA in Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola (Xoc) senses extracytoplasmic iron and changes the hydrogen bonding network of ligand channel domains. The frequency of A-to-I RNA editing during iron-deficient conditions increased by 76.87%, which facilitated the passage of iron through the XfeA outer membrane channel. When bacteria were subjected to high iron concentrations, the percentage of A-to-I editing in xfeA decreased, which reduced iron transport via XfeA. Furthermore, A-to-I RNA editing increased expression of multiple genes in the chemotaxis pathway, including methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) that sense concentrations of exogenous ferric enterobactin (Fe-Ent) at the cytoplasmic membrane. A-to-I RNA editing helps Xoc move towards an iron-rich environment and supports our contention that editing in xfeA facilitates entry of a ferric siderophore. Overall, our results reveal a new signaling mechanism that bacteria use to facilitate iron uptake and improve their competitiveness.",

    "abstract": "Multicellular organisms coordinate tissue specific response to environmental information via both cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms. In addition to secreted ligands, secreted small RNAs have recently been reported to regulate gene expression across tissue boundaries. Here we show that the conserved poly-U specific endoribonuclease ENDU-2 is secreted from the soma and taken-up by the germline to ensure germline immortality at elevated temperature in C. elegans. ENDU-2 binds to mature mRNAs and negatively regulates mRNA abundance both in the soma and the germline. While ENDU-2 promotes RNA decay in the soma directly via its endoribonuclease activity, ENDU-2 prevents misexpression of soma-specific genes in the germline and preserves germline immortality independent of its RNA-cleavage activity. In summary, our results suggest that the secreted RNase ENDU-2 transmits environmental information across tissue boundaries and contributes to maintenance of stem cell immortality probably via retaining a stem cell specific program of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "During tumor growth - when nutrient and anabolic demands are high - autophagy supports tumor metabolism and growth through lysosomal organelle turnover and nutrient recycling1. Ras-driven tumors additionally invoke non-autonomous autophagy in the microenvironment to support tumor growth, in part through transfer of amino acids2-4. Here we uncover a third critical role of autophagy in mediating systemic organ wasting and nutrient mobilization for tumor growth using a well-characterized malignant tumor model in Drosophila melanogaster. Micro-computed X-ray tomography and metabolic profiling reveal that RasV12; scrib-/- tumors grow 10-fold in volume, while systemic organ wasting unfolds with progressive muscle atrophy, loss of body mass, -motility, -feeding and eventually death. Tissue wasting is found to be mediated by autophagy and results in host mobilization of amino acids and sugars into circulation. Natural abundance Carbon 13 tracing demonstrates that tumor biomass is increasingly derived from host tissues as a nutrient source as wasting progresses. We conclude that host autophagy mediates organ wasting and nutrient mobilization that is utilized for tumor growth.",

    "abstract": "Cellular processes, in particular homeostasis and growth, require an intricate and complex exchange of matter between a cell and its surroundings. Yet experimental difficulties have prevented a detailed description of the dynamics of a cells mass and volume along different cellular processes, limiting our understanding of cell physiology in health and disease. It has been recently observed that single mammalian cells fluctuate their mass in a timescale of seconds. This result challenges central and long-standing cell growth models, according to which cells increase their mass either linearly or exponentially throughout the cell cycle. However, it remains unclear to what extent cell mass fluctuations may be sustained in multicellular organisms. Here I provide a mathematical model for cell mass fluctuations and explore how such fluctuations can be successfully sustained in multicellular organisms. I postulate that cells do not synchronise their mass fluctuations, but they are executed with their phases uniformly distributed. I derive a mathematical expression to estimate the resulting mass shift between fluid compartments in an organism due to cell mass fluctuations. Together with a new estimate of 4x1013 human cells in the body, I demonstrate that my hypothesis leads to shifts of mass between the intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments in the human body that are approximately or smaller than 0.25 mg and, therefore, perfectly viable. The proposed model connects cell physiology with information theory and entropy.",

S1R modulates activity of multiple effector proteins but its signaling functions are poorly understood. We here test the hypothesis that biological activity of S1R in cells can be explained by its ability to interact with cholesterol and to form cholesterol-enriched microdomains in the ER. Using reduced reconstitution systems, we demonstrate direct effects of cholesterol on S1R clustering. We identify a novel cholesterol-binding motif in the transmembrane region of S1R and demonstrate its importance for S1R clustering. We demonstrate that S1R-induced membrane microdomains have increased local membrane thickness. Increased local cholesterol concentration and membrane thickness in these domains can modulate signaling of inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) in the ER. Further, S1R agonists cause reduction in S1R clusters, suggesting that biological activity of S1R agonists is linked to remodeling of ER membrane microdomains.",

    "abstract": "The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, is one of the most prolific invasive species to the Southeastern U.S. These invaders preferentially colonize highly disturbed land and grassland habitat. Management of livestock in pasture systems can have a profound impact on the level of disturbance in grassland habitats, and we hypothesized that pasture management would have a significant effect on S. invicta abundance in the Southeastern U.S., and arthropod diversity would negatively correlate with this invasive species. We studied the effects that pasture management systems (based on stocking density, rotation frequency, and insecticide application rates) have on fire ant mound abundance and arthropod diversity for the soil, foliar, and dung communities. S. invicta mounds were quantified and mound areas were documented along transect lines in six pastures. Soil and foliar arthropod communities were collected along the same transect lines, and dung communities sampled from pats within the pasture system. Pastures managed under adaptive multi-paddock (AMP) practices had 3.35x more S. invicta mounds and 4.64x more mound area than their conventionally managed counterparts. However, arthropod diversity did not correlate with S. invicta abundance for any of the three arthropod communities sampled. This study shows pasture management can have a significant impact on S. invicta mound abundance, but arthropod communities in AMP managed pastures did not suffer decreased diversity from increased abundance of S. invicta. Additionally, this study demonstrates that this invasive species does not necessarily contribute to diversity decline, at least under AMP pasture systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe controlled domain vocabularies provided by ontologies make them an indispensable tool for text mining. Ontologies also include semantic features in the form of taxonomy and axioms, which make annotated entities in text corpora useful for semantic analysis. Extending those semantic features may improve performance for characterisation and analytic tasks. Ontology learning techniques have previously been explored for novel ontology construction from text, though most recent approaches have focused on literature, with applications in information retrieval or human interaction tasks. We hypothesise that extension of existing ontologies using information mined from clinical narrative text may help to adapt those ontologies such that they better characterise those texts, and lead to improved classification performance.\n\nResultsWe develop and present a framework for identifying new classes in text corpora, which can be integrated into existing ontology hierarchies. To do this, we employ the Stanford Open Information Extraction algorithm and integrate its implementation into the Komenti semantic text mining framework. To identify whether our approach leads to better characterisation of text, we present a case study, using the method to learn an adaptation to the Disease Ontology using text associated with a sample of 1,000 patient visits from the MIMIC-III critical care database. We use the adapted ontology to annotate and classify shared first diagnosis on patient visits with semantic similarity, revealing an improved performance over use of the base Disease Ontology on the set of visits the ontology was constructed from. Moreover, we show that the adapted ontology also improved performance for the same task over two additional unseen samples of 1,000 and 2,500 patient visits.\n\nConclusionsWe report a promising new method for ontology learning and extension from text. We demonstrate that we can successfully use the method to adapt an existing ontology to a textual dataset, improving its ability to characterise the dataset, and leading to improved analytic performance, even on unseen portions of the dataset.",

    "abstract": "Due to screening limitations, in directed evolution (DE) of proteins it is rarely feasible to fully evaluate combinatorial mutant libraries made by mutagenesis at multiple sites. Instead, DE often involves a single-step greedy optimization in which the mutation in the highest-fitness variant identified in each round of single-site mutagenesis is fixed. However, because the effects of a mutation can depend on the presence or absence of other mutations, the efficiency and effectiveness of a single-step greedy walk is influenced by both the starting variant and the order in which beneficial mutations are identified--the process is path-dependent. We recently demonstrated a path-independent machine learning-assisted approach to directed evolution (MLDE) that allows in silico screening of full combinatorial libraries made by simultaneous saturation mutagenesis, thus explicitly capturing the effects of cooperative mutations and bypassing the path-dependence that can limit greedy optimization. Here, we thoroughly investigate and optimize an MLDE workflow by testing a number of design considerations of the MLDE pipeline. Specifically, we (1) test the effects of different encoding strategies on MLDE efficiency, (2) integrate new models and a training procedure more amenable to protein engineering tasks, and (3) incorporate training set design strategies to avoid information-poor low-fitness protein variants (\"holes\") in the training data. When applied to an epistatic, hole-filled, four-site combinatorial fitness landscape of protein G domain B1 (GB1), the resulting focused training MLDE (ftMLDE) protocol achieved the global fitness maximum up to 92% of the time at a total screening burden of 470 variants. In contrast, minimal-screening-burden single-step greedy optimization over the GB1 fitness landscape reached the global maximum just 1.2% of the time; ftMLDE matching this minimal screening burden (80 total variants) achieved the global optimum up to 9.6% of the time with a 49% higher expected maximum fitness achieved. To facilitate further development of MLDE, we present the MLDE software package (https://github.com/fhalab/MLDE), which is designed for use by protein engineers without computational or machine learning expertise.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutomated assignment of specific ontology concepts to mentions in text is a critical task in biomedical natural language processing, and the subject of many open shared tasks. Although the current state of the art involves the use of neural network language models as a post-processing step, the very large number of ontology classes to be recognized and the limited amount of gold-standard training data has impeded the creation of end-to-end systems based entirely on machine learning. Recently, Hailu et al. recast the concept recognition problem as a type of machine translation and demonstrated that sequence-to-sequence machine learning models had the potential to outperform multi-class classification approaches. Here we systematically characterize the factors that contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of several approaches to sequence-to-sequence machine learning.\n\nResultsWe report on our extensive studies of alternative methods and hyperparameter selections. The results not only identify the best-performing systems and parameters across a wide variety of ontologies but also illuminate about the widely varying resource requirements and hyperparameter robustness of alternative approaches. Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of such systems suggest promising avenues for future improvements as well as design choices that can increase computational efficiency with small costs in performance. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT) for span detection (as previously found) along with the Open-source Toolkit for Neural Machine Translation (OpenNMT) for concept normalization achieve state-of-the-art performance for most ontologies in CRAFT Corpus. This approach uses substantially fewer computational resources, including hardware, memory, and time than several alternative approaches.\n\nConclusionsMachine translation is a promising avenue for fully machine-learning-based concept recognition that achieves state-of-the-art results on the CRAFT Corpus, evaluated via a direct comparison to previous results from the 2019 CRAFT Shared Task.

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the aetiology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19) pandemic. ICEP4 purified compound (ICEP4) is a recently discovered furocoumarin-related purified compound derived from the roots and seeds of Angelica archangelica (herbal drug). ICEP4-related herbal preparations have been extensively used as active herbal ingredients in traditional medicine treatments in several European countries. Extraction method of patent pending ICEP4 (patent application no. GB2017123.7) has previously shown strong manufacturing robustness, long-lasting stability, and repeated chemical consistency. Here we show that ICEP4 presents a significant in vitro cytoprotective effect in highly virulent-SARS-CoV-2 challenged Vero E6 cellular cultures, using doses of 34.5 and 69 M. No dose-related ICEP4 toxicity was observed in Vero E6 cells, M0 macrophages, B, CD4+ T and CD8+ T lymphocytes, Natural Killer (NK) or Natural Killer T (NKT) cells. No dose-related ICEP4 inflammatory response was observed in M0 macrophages quantified by IL6 and TNF release in cell supernatant. No decrease in survival rate was observed after either 24 hr acute or 21-day chronic exposure in in vivo toxicity studies performed in C. elegans. Therefore, ICEP4 toxicological profile has demonstrated marked differences compared to others vegetal furocoumarins. Successful ICEP4 doses against SARS-CoV-2-challenged cells are within the maximum threshold of toxicity concern (TTC) of furocoumarins as herbal preparation, stated by European Medicines Agency (EMA). The characteristic chemical compounding of ICEP4, along with its safe TTC, allow us to assume that the first-observation of a natural antiviral compound has occurred. The potential druggability of a new synthetic ICEP4-related compound remains to be elucidated. However, well-established historical use of ICEP4-related compounds as herbal preparations may point towards an already-safe, widely extended remedy, which may be ready-to-go for large-scale clinical trials under the EMA emergency regulatory pathway. To the best of the authors knowledge, ICEP4-related herbal drug can be postulated as a promising therapeutic treatment for COVID19.",

    "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that maternal undernutrition exerts a greater effect on offspring metabolic function compared to maternal overnutrition, female rats (n=10 per group) were subjected to a high calorie diet or 50 % global nutrient restriction relative to control rats on standard rat chow, for 8 weeks prior to pregnancy and during pregnancy. Birth weight was determined on the day dams were found with pups. At 3 months of age, offsprings fasting blood glucose, serum insulin and triglyceride levels as well as glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were determined. A 50 % calorie restriction caused a significant weight loss in the under-nourished dams but those on high calorie diet had similar body weight as control rats. Maternal overnutrition and undernutrition significantly lowered birth weight, indicating intra-uterine growth restriction in these animals. Fasting blood glucose was significantly higher in female offspring of over-nourished dams, but neither maternal overnutrition nor undernutrition affected offsprings glucose tolerance. Male offspring of dams exposed to maternal overnutrition or undernutrition had a significantly higher insulin level compared to control, whereas female offspring were unaffected. The development of hyperinsulinaemia in male offspring of undernourished dams was accompanied by reduced insulin sensitivity. This study demonstrates that early-life exposure to two extreme ends of the nutritional plane is associated with similar birth weight outcome but different metabolic phenotype in adulthood. Evidence of insulin resistance only in male offspring of under-nourished dams indicates differences in sex-specific metabolic effect of maternal undernutrition compared to overnutrition.",

    "abstract": "An important goal for vision science is to develop quantitative models for the representation of visual signals at post-receptoral sites. To this end, we develop the quadratic color model (QCM) and examine its ability to account for the BOLD fMRI response in human V1 to spatially-uniform temporal chromatic modulations, systematically varying in their chromatic directions and contrasts. We find that the QCM explains the same, cross-validated variance as a conventional GLM, with far fewer free parameters. The QCM generalizes to allow prediction of V1 responses to a large range of modulations. We replicated the results for each subject and find good agreement across both replications and subjects. We find that within the LM cone contrast plane, V1 is most sensitive to L-M contrast modulations and least sensitive to L+M contrast modulations. Within V1, we observe little to no change in chromatic sensitivity as a function of eccentricity.",

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown the potential value of Bayesian methods in fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) analysis. For instance, the results from Bayes factor-applied second-level fMRI analysis showed a higher hit rate compared with frequentist second-level fMRI analysis, suggesting greater sensitivity. Although the method reported more positives as a result of the higher sensitivity, it was able to maintain a reasonable level of selectivity in term of the false positive rate. Moreover, employment of the multiple comparison correction method to update the default prior distribution significantly improved the performance of Bayesian second-level fMRI analysis. However, previous studies have utilized the default prior distribution and did not consider the nature of each individual study. Thus, in the present study, a method to adjust the Cauchy prior distribution based on a priori information, which can be acquired from the results of relevant previous studies, was proposed and tested. A Cauchy prior distribution was adjusted based on the contrast, noise strength, and proportion of true positives that were estimated from a meta-analysis of relevant previous studies. In the present study, both the simulated images and real contrast images from two previous studies were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results showed that the employment of the prior adjustment method resulted in improved performance of Bayesian second-level fMRI analysis.",

    "abstract": "How animals learn to discriminate between different sensory stimuli is an intriguing question. An important, common step towards discrimination is the enhancement of differences between the representations of relevant stimuli. This can be part of the learning process. In rodents, the olfac-tory bulb, which is known to contribute to this pattern separation, exhibits extensive structural synaptic plasticity even in adult animals: reciprocal connections between excitatory mitral cells and inhibitory granule cells are persistently formed and eliminated, correlated with mitral cell and granule cell activity. Here we present a Hebbian-type model for this plasticity. It captures the experimental observation that the same learning protocol that enhanced the discriminability of similar stimuli actually reduced that of dissimilar stimuli. The model predicts that the learned bulbar network structure is remembered across training with additional stimuli, unless the new stimuli interfere with the representations of previously learned ones.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric disease often produces symptoms that have divergent effects on neural activity. For example, in drug dependence, dysfunctional value-based decision-making and compulsive-like actions have been linked to hypo- and hyper-activity of orbital frontal cortex (OFC)-basal ganglia circuits, respectively, however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that alcohol dependence enhanced activity in OFC terminals in dorsal striatum (OFC-DS) associated with actions, but reduced activity of the same terminals during periods of outcome retrieval, corresponding with a loss of outcome control over decision-making. Disrupted OFC-DS terminal activity was due to a dysfunction of dopamine-type 1 receptors on spiny projection neurons (D1R SPNs) that resulted in increased retrograde endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling at OFC-D1R SPN synapses reducing OFC-DS transmission. Blocking CB1 receptors restored OFC-DS activity in vivo and rescued outcome-based control over decision-making. These findings demonstrate a circuit-, synapse-, and computation specific mechanism gating OFC activity following the induction of alcohol dependence.",

This process called A-to-I editing masks self-dsRNA from detection by the antiviral dsRNA sensor MDA5. ADAR1 binds to dsRNA in both the canonical A-form and in the poorly defined Z-conformation (Z-RNA). Mutations in the Z-RNA binding Z-domain of ADAR1 are common in AGS patients. How loss of ADAR1/Z-RNA interaction contributes to disease development is unknown. Using ADAR1 Z-domain mutant human cells and knock-in mice, we demonstrate that abrogated binding of ADAR1 to Z-RNA leads to reduced A-to-I editing of dsRNA structures formed by pairing of inversely oriented SINEs. As a result, ADAR1 Z-domain mutant human cells and transgenic mice develop a spontaneous MDA5-dependent immune response. This shows that the interaction between ADAR1 and Z-RNA restricts sensing of self-dsRNA and prevents AGS development.",

We report that knock-in mice bearing two point mutations in the Z domain of ADAR1, which abolish binding to Z-form nucleic acids, spontaneously induced type I IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in multiple organs. This included the lung where both stromal and haematopoietic cells displayed ISG induction in Adar1mZ/mZ mice. Concomitantly, Adar1mZ/mZ mice showed improved control of influenza A virus. The spontaneous IFN response in Adar1mZ/mZ mice required MAVS, implicating cytosolic RNA sensing. Finally, analysis of A-to-I changes revealed a specific requirement of ADAR1s Z domain in editing of a subset of RNAs.

    "abstract": "Some bacterial pathogens utilize cell-cell communication systems, such as quorum sensing (QS), to coordinate genetic programs during host colonization and infection. The human-restricted pathosymbiont Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A Streptococcus, GAS) uses the Rgg2/Rgg3 QS system to modify the bacterial surface, enabling biofilm formation and lysozyme resistance. Here, we demonstrate that innate immune cell responses to GAS are substantially altered by the QS status of the bacteria. We found that macrophage activation, stimulated by multiple agonists and assessed by cytokine production and NF{kappa}B activity, was substantially suppressed upon interaction with QS-active GAS but not QS-inactive bacteria. Neither macrophage viability nor bacterial adherence were seen as different between QS activity states, yet TNF, IL-6, and IFN{beta} levels and NF{kappa}B reporter activity were drastically lower following infection with QS-active GAS. Suppression required contact between viable bacteria and macrophages. A QS-regulated biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) in the GAS genome, encoding several putative enzymes, was also required for macrophage modulation. Our findings suggest a model wherein upon contact with macrophages, QS-active GAS produce a BGC-derived factor capable of suppressing inflammatory responses. The suppressive capability of QS-active GAS is abolished after treatment with a specific QS inhibitor. These observations suggest that interfering with the ability of bacteria to collaborate via QS can serve as a strategy to counteract microbial efforts to manipulate host defenses.\n\nImportanceStreptococcus pyogenes is restricted to human hosts and commonly causes superficial diseases such as pharyngitis; it can also cause severe and deadly manifestations including necrotizing skin disease or severe post-infectious sequelae like rheumatic heart disease. Understanding the complex mechanisms used by this pathogen to manipulate host defenses could aid in developing new therapeutics to treat infections. Here, we examine the impact of a bacterial cell-cell communication system, which is highly conserved across S. pyogenes, on host innate immune responses. We find that S. pyogenes uses this system to suppress macrophage pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. Interference with this communication system could serve as a strategy to disarm bacteria and maintain an effective immune response.",

    "abstract": "The apicomplexan parasite Cryptosporidium parvum contains an expanded family of 22 insulinase like proteases (INS), a feature that contrasts with their otherwise streamlined genome. Here we examined the function of INS1, which is most similar to the human insulinase protease that cleaves a variety of small peptide substrates. INS1 is a M16A clan member and contains a signal peptide, an N-terminal domain with the HxxEH active site, followed by three inactive domains. Unlike previously studied C. parvum INS proteins that are expressed in sporozoites and during merogony, INS1 was expressed exclusively in macrogamonts, where it was localized in small cytoplasmic vesicles. Although INS1 did not colocalize with the oocyst wall protein recognized by the antibody OW50, immune-electron microscopy indicated that INS1 resides in small vesicles in the secretory system. Notably, these small INS1 positive vesicles often subtend large vacuoles resembling wall forming bodies, which contain precursors for oocyst wall formation. Genetic deletion of INS1, or replacement with an active site mutant, resulted in lower formation of macrogamonts in vitro and reduced oocyst shedding in vivo. Our findings reveal that INS1 functions in formation or maturation of macrogamonts and that its loss results in attenuated virulence in immunocompromised mice.\n\nImportanceCryptosporidiosis is a debilitating diarrheal disease in young children in developing countries. Absence of effective treatments or vaccines makes this infection very difficult to manage in susceptible populations. Although the oral dose of oocysts needed to cause infection is low, infected individuals shed very high numbers of oocysts, hence readily contaminating the environment. Our studies demonstrate that the protease INS1 is important for formation of female sexual stages and that in its absence, parasites produce fewer oocysts and are attenuated in immunocompromised mice. These findings suggest that mutants lacking INS1, or related proteases, may be useful for producing attenuated vaccines to induce immunity without causing disease.",

    "abstract": "Bats are increasingly studied as model systems for longevity and as natural hosts for some virulent viruses. Yet our ability to characterize immune mechanisms of viral tolerance and to quantify infection dynamics in wild bats is often limited by small sample volumes and few species-specific reagents. Here, we demonstrate how proteomics can overcome these limitations by using data-independent acquisition-based shotgun proteomics to survey the serum proteome of 17 vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) from Belize. Using just 2 L of sample and relatively short separations of undepleted serum digests, we identified 361 proteins across five orders of magnitude. Data are available via ProteomeXchange with identifier PXD022885. Levels of immunological proteins in vampire bat serum were then compared to human plasma via published databases. Of particular interest were anti-viral and anti-bacterial components, circulating 20S proteasome complex, and proteins involved in redox activity; whether any results are specific to vampire bats could be assessed by future pan-mammalian analyses. Lastly, we used known virus proteomes to identify Rh186 from Macacine herpesvirus 3 and ORF1a from Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, indicating that mass spectrometry-based techniques show promise for pathogen detection. Overall, these results can be used to design targeted mass-spectrometry assays to quantify immunological markers and detect pathogens. More broadly, our findings also highlight the application of proteomics in advancing wildlife immunology and pathogen surveillance.",

How SMC complexes translocate along DNA for loop extrusion and what happens when two complexes meet on the same DNA molecule is largely unknown. Revealing the origins and the consequences of SMC encounters is crucial for understanding the folding process not only of bacterial, but also of eukaryotic chromosomes. Here, we uncover several factors that influence bacterial chromosome organization by modulating the probability of such clashes. These factors include the number, the strength and the distribution of Smc loading sites, the residence time on the chromosome, the translocation rate, and the cellular abundance of Smc complexes. By studying various mutants, we show that these parameters are fine-tuned to reduce the frequency of encounters between Smc complexes, presumably as a risk mitigation strategy. Mild perturbations hamper chromosome organization by causing Smc collisions, implying that the cellular capacity to resolve them is rather limited. Altogether, we identify mechanisms that help to avoid Smc collisions and their resolution by Smc traversal or other potentially risky molecular transactions.",

This requires a good understanding of the processes that regulate arable weed dynamics in arable fields.\n\nWe adopted a systems framework to understand and model interacting components that drive the weed dynamics in 168 arable fields. Within this framework, we built a structural equation model (SEM) to quantify the direct and indirect effects of crop rotation (i.e. crops in the previous three years and the current year) and carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) on weed density, seed abundance and accumulation in the seedbank. We included results from a mechanistic approach to infer interactions between seed-feeding carabid beetles and seeds to estimate predation pressure in each field.\n\nOur results show that weeds in arable fields are regulated by crop type, sowing season, and activity density of carabid beetles. We found a direct effect of crop rotation, including both past and current field management practice, on weed abundance in the field and its seedbank. There was also an indirect effect of crops on weed seed accumulation in the seedbank via the effect of seed-eating carabid beetles. The efficiency of weed control by carabid beetles depended on the cumulative predation pressure, which indicates the importance of functional diversity as well as abundance.\n\nFarmers and agronomists can capitalise on the ecosystem services provided by carabid beetles by adapting agronomic practices and crop rotation to maintain a rich fauna of seed-eating carabids in fields and potentially across the agricultural landscapes. When integrated with rotational management practices, this ecosystem services can improve the efficiency of weed management and contribute to the sustainability of cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genetic variants that are associated with complex traits. However, a stringent significance threshold is required to identify robust genetic associations. Leveraging relevant auxiliary covariates has the potential to boost statistical power to exceed the significance threshold. Particularly, abundant pleiotropy and the non-random distribution of SNPs across various functional categories suggests that leveraging GWAS test statistics from related traits and/or functional genomic data may boost GWAS discovery. While type 1 error rate control has become standard in GWAS, control of the false discovery rate can be a more powerful approach. The conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) extends the standard FDR framework by conditioning on auxiliary data to call significant associations, but current implementations are restricted to auxiliary data satisfying specific parametric distributions, typically GWAS p-values for related traits. We relax these distributional assumptions, enabling an extension of the cFDR framework that supports auxiliary covariates from arbitrary continuous distributions (\"Flexible cFDR\"). Our method can be applied iteratively, thereby supporting multi-dimensional covariate data. Through simulations we show that Flexible cFDR increases sensitivity whilst controlling FDR after one or several iterations. We further demonstrate its practical potential through application to an asthma GWAS, leveraging various functional genomic data to find additional genetic associations for asthma, which we validate in the larger, independent, UK Biobank data resource.\n\nAuthor summaryGenome-wide association studies (GWAS) detect regions of the human genome that are associated with various traits, including complex diseases, but the power to detect these genomic regions is currently limited by sample size. The conditional false discovery rate (cFDR) provides a tool to leverage one GWAS study to improve power in another. The motivation is that if two traits have some genetic correlation, then our interpretation of a low but not significant p-value for the trait of interest will differ depending on whether that SNP shows strong or absent evidence of association with the related trait. Here, we describe an extension to the cFDR framework, called \"Flexible cFDR\", that controls the FDR and supports auxiliary data from arbitrary distributions, surpassing current implementations of cFDR which are restricted to leveraging GWAS p-values from related traits. In practice, our method can be used to iteratively leverage various types of functional genomic data with GWAS data to increase power for GWAS discovery. We describe the use of Flexible cFDR to supplement data from a GWAS of asthma with auxiliary data from functional genomic experiments. We identify associations novel to the original GWAS and validate these discoveries with reference to a larger, more highly-powered GWAS of asthma.",

Quality of life (QoL) was assessed with the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions at three levels (EQ-5D-3L) and depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionarie-9 (PHQ-9). To evaluate factors associated with QoL and depressive symptoms, linear and adjusted regressions were used, with robust variance reporting coefficients ({beta}).\n\nResultsThe percentage of participants most affected by QoL dimension was: anxiety/depression (47.2%) and pain/discomfort (35.6%). Regarding the Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS) of QoL, the score was 76.0 + 25.6. Those who had family economic decline during quarantine ({beta}=-3.4, IC95%=-6.5 to -0.3) or family with chronic diseases ({beta}=-3.7, IC95%=-6.1 to -1.4) presented significantly lower scores in their QoL. Regarding depressive symptomatology, the university students reported a moderate to severe level (28.9%). A higher risk of depressive symptoms was found in residents of Ayacucho ({beta}=0.8, IC95%=0.1 to 1.5), those who were released from quarantine ({beta}=0.7, IC95%=0.2 to 1.2) and those who had a family member with chronic disease ({beta}=1.5, IC95%=1.0 to 2.1).\n\nConclusionsAlmost half and one third of participants reported anxiety/depression, and pain/discomfort in their QoL respectively. Nearly a third presented moderate and severe depressive symptoms. The deterioration of QoL was worse in those who had a decrease in income and a family member with chronic illness.

Whereas AMPAR subunits GluA1-GluA3 have been linked to particular forms of synaptic plasticity and learning, the functional role of GluA4 remains elusive. Here we used electrophysiological, computational and behavioral approaches to demonstrate a crucial function of GluA4 for synaptic excitation and associative memory formation in the cerebellum. Notably, GluA4-knockout mice had [~]80% reduced mossy fiber to granule cell synaptic transmission. The fidelity of granule cell spike output was markedly decreased despite attenuated tonic inhibition and increased NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. Computational modeling revealed that GluA4 facilitates pattern separation that is important for associative learning. On a behavioral level, while locomotor coordination was generally spared, GluA4-knockout mice failed to form associative memories during delay eyeblink conditioning.

    "abstract": "Accurate memory formation has been hypothesized to depend on both rapid Hebbian plasticity for initial encoding, and slower homeostatic mechanisms that prevent runaway excitation and subsequent loss of memory specificity. Here, we tested the role of synaptic scaling in shaping the specificity of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) memory, a Hebbian plasticity-dependent form of associative learning. We found that CTA memory initially generalized to non-conditioned tastants (generalized aversion), becoming specific to the conditioned tastant only over the course of many hours. Blocking synaptic scaling in the gustatory cortex (GC) prolonged the duration of the initial generalized aversion and enhanced the persistence of synaptic strength increases observed after CTA. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that synaptic scaling is important for sculpting the specificity of an associative memory and suggest that the relative strengths of Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity can modulate the balance between stable memory formation and generalization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo improve early detection of emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), many of them zoonotic, numerous electronic animal disease-reporting systems have been piloted but not implemented because of cost, lack of user friendliness, and data insecurity. In Kenya, we developed and rolled out an open-source mobile phone-based domestic and wild animal disease reporting system and collected data over two years to demonstrate its robustness and ability to track disease trends.\n\nMethodsThe Kenya Animal Biosurveillance System (KABS) application was built on the Java(R) platform, freely downloadable for android compatible mobile phones, and supported by web-based account management, form editing and data monitoring. The application was integrated into the surveillance systems of Kenyas domestic and wild animal sectors by adopting their existing data collection tools, and targeting disease syndromes prioritized by national, regional and international animal and human health agencies. Smartphone-owning government and private domestic and wild animal health officers were recruited and trained on the application, and reports received and analyzed by Kenya Directorate of Veterinary Services. The KABS application performed automatic basic analyses (frequencies, spatial distribution), which were immediately relayed to reporting officers as feedback.\n\nResultsOver 95% of trained domestic animal officers downloaded the application, and >72% of them started reporting using the application within three months. Introduction of the application resulted in 2- to 10-fold increase in number of disease reports when compared the previous year (p<0.05), and reports were more spatially distributed. Among domestic animals, food animals (cattle, sheep, goats, camels, and chicken) accounted for >90% of the reports, with respiratory, gastrointestinal and skin diseases constituting >85% of the reports. Herbivore wildlife (zebra, buffalo, elephant, giraffe, antelopes) accounted for >60% of the wildlife disease reports, followed by carnivores (lions, cheetah, hyenas, jackals, and wild dogs). Deaths, traumatic injuries, and skin diseases were most reported in wildlife.\n\nConclusionsThis open-source system was user friendly and secure, ideal for rolling out in other countries in SSA to improve disease reporting and enhance preparedness for epidemics of zoonotic diseases.\n\nAuthors SummaryTaking advantage of a recently developed freely downloadable disease reporting application in the United States, we customized it for android smartphones to collect and submit domestic and wild animal disease data in real-time in Kenya. To enhance user friendliness, the Kenya Animal Biosurveillance System (KABS) was installed with disease reporting tools currently used by the animal sector and tailored to collected data on transboundary animal disease important for detecting zoonotic endemic and emerging diseases. The KABS database was housed by the government of Kenya, providing important assurance on its security. The application had a feedback module that performed basics analysis to provide feedback to the end-user in real-time. Rolling out of KABS resulted in >70% of domestic and wildlife disease surveillance officers using it to report, resulting in exponential increase in frequency and spatial distributions of reports regions. Utility of the system was demonstrated by successful detected a Rift Valley fever outbreak in livestock in 2018, resulting in early response and prevention of widespread human infections. For the wildlife sector in Eastern Africa, the application provided the first disease surveillance system developed. This open-source system is ideal for rolling out in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa to improve disease reporting and enhance preparedness for epidemics of zoonotic diseases.",

Mouse ocular tissue sections were immunolabeled against aquaporins 1(AQP1), 4(AQP4), and 9(AQP9). Ocular tissue was imaged to identify normal AQP distribution, ON changes, and axon loss after IOP elevation. Ultrastructure examination, cell proliferation, gene expression & transport block was also analyzed.\n\nResultsB6 mice presented abundant AQP4 in Muller cells, astrocytes of retina and myelinated ON (MON), but minimal expression in prelaminar and unmyelinated ON (UON). MON of AQP4 nulls had smaller ON area, smaller axon diameter, higher axon density, and larger proportionate axon area than B6 (all p[&le;]0.05). Bead-injection led to comparable 3D-IOP elevation (p=0.42) and axonal transport blockade in both strains. In B6, AQP4 distribution was unchanged after 3D-IOP. At baseline, AQP1 and AQP9 were present in retina, but not in UON and this was unaffected after IOP elevation in both strains. In 3D-IOP mice, ON astrocytes and microglia proliferated, more in B6 than AQP4 null. After 6 week IOP elevation, axon loss occurred equally in the two mouse types (24.6%, AQP4 null vs. 23.3%, B6).\n\nConclusionLack of AQP4 was neither protective nor detrimental to the effects of IOP elevation. The minimal presence of AQP4 in UON may be a vital aspect of the regionally specific phenotype of astrocytes in the mouse optic nerve head.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian Hedgehog (HH) signalling pathway plays an essential role in tissue homeostasis and its deregulation is linked to rheumatological disorders. UBR5 is the mammalian homologue of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Hyd, a negative regulator of the Hh-pathway in Drosophila. To investigate a possible role of UBR5 in regulation of the musculoskeletal system through modulation of mammalian HH signaling, we created a mouse model for specific loss of Ubr5 function in limb bud mesenchyme. Our findings revealed a role for UBR5 in maintaining cartilage homeostasis and suppressing metaplasia. Ubr5 loss of function resulted in progressive and dramatic articular cartilage degradation, enlarged, abnormally shaped sesamoid bones and extensive heterotopic tissue metaplasia linked to calcification of tendons and ossification of synovium. Genetic suppression of smoothened (Smo), a key mediator of HH signalling, dramatically enhanced the Ubr5 mutant phenotype. Analysis of HH signalling in both mouse and cell model systems revealed that loss of Ubr5 stimulated canonical HH-signalling while also increasing PKA activity. In addition, human osteoarthritic samples revealed similar correlations between UBR5 expression, canonical HH signalling and PKA activity markers. Our studies identified a crucial function for the Ubr5 gene in the maintenance of skeletal tissue homeostasis and an unexpected mode of regulation of the HH signalling pathway.\n\nAuthor SummaryUbiquitin ligases modify proteins post-translationally which is essential for a variety of cellular processes. UBR5 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and in Drosophila is a regulator of Hedgehog signaling. In mammals, the Hedgehog (HH) signalling pathway, among many other roles, plays an essential role in tissue maintenance, a process called homeostasis. A murine genetic system was developed to specifically eliminate UBR5 function from embryonic limb tissue that subsequently forms bone and connective tissue (ligaments and tendons). This approach revealed that UBR5 operates as a potent suppressor of excessive growth of normal cartilage and bone and prevents formation of bone in ectopic sites in connective tissue near the knees and ankle joints. In contrast to abnormal growth, UBR5 inhibits degradation of the articular cartilage that cushions the knee joint leading to extensive exposure of underlying bone. Furthermore, Ubr5 interacts with smoothened, a component of the HH pathway, identifying UBR5 as a regulator of mammalian HH signaling in the postnatal musculoskeletal system. In summary, this work shows that UBR5 interacts with the HH pathway to regulate skeletal homeostasis in and around joints of the legs and identifies targets that may be harnessed for biomedical engineering and clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Forward engineering synthetic circuits is at the core of synthetic biology. Automated solutions will be required to facilitate circuit design and implementation. Circuit design is increasingly being automated with design software, but innovations in experimental automation are lagging behind. Microfluidic technologies made it possible to perform in vitro transcription-translation (tx-tl) reactions with increasing throughput and sophistication, enabling screening and characterization of individual circuit elements and complete circuit designs. Here we developed an automated microfluidic cell-free processing unit (CFPU) that extends high-throughput screening capabilities to a continuous reaction environment, which is essential for the implementation and analysis of more complex and dynamic circuits. The CFPU contains 280 chemostats that can be individually programmed with DNA circuits. Each chemostat is periodically supplied with tx-tl reagents, giving rise to sustained, long-term steady state conditions. Using microfluidic pulse width modulation (PWM) the device is able to generate tx-tl reagent compositions in real-time. The device has higher throughput, lower reagent consumption, and overall higher functionality than current chemostat devices. We applied this technology to map transcription factor based repression under equilibrium conditions and implemented dynamic gene circuits switchable by small molecules. We expect the CFPU to help bridge the gap between circuit design and experimental automation for in vitro development of synthetic gene circuits.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic spread of SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, represents a significant and ongoing international health crisis. A key symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the onset of fever, with a hyperthermic temperature range of 38 to 41{degrees}C. Fever is an evolutionarily conserved host response to microbial infection and inflammation that can influence the outcome of viral pathogenicity and regulation of host innate and adaptive immune responses. However, it remains to be determined what effect elevated temperature has on SARS-CoV-2 tropism and replication. Utilizing a 3D air-liquid interface (ALI) model that closely mimics the natural tissue physiology and cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the respiratory airway, we identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the regulation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We show that temperature elevation induces wide-spread transcriptome changes that impact upon the regulation of multiple pathways, including epigenetic regulation and lncRNA expression, without disruption of general cellular transcription or the induction of interferon (IFN)-mediated antiviral immune defences. Respiratory tissue incubated at temperatures >37{degrees}C remained permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection but severely restricted the initiation of viral transcription, leading to significantly reduced levels of intraepithelial viral RNA accumulation and apical shedding of infectious virus. To our knowledge, we present the first evidence that febrile temperatures associated with COVID-19 inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication. Our data identify an important role for temperature elevation in the epithelial restriction of SARS-CoV-2 that occurs independently of the induction of canonical IFN-mediated antiviral immune defences and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression.",

    "abstract": "With the aim of developing a sensor for chromosome loss in vivo, we used the well-established GAL4/GAL80 system combined with a visual GFP marker in Drosophila. We show a low frequency of green cells in most Drosophila tissues, suggesting low aneuploidy levels. Unexpectedly, in the brain, GFP positive cells are more frequent, but in this case, they do not represent chromosome loss. Using genetic manipulations, RNA FISH and time-lapse microscopy, we uncovered a dynamic and reversible silencing of GAL80 that occurs in Drosophila neural stem cells. Further, we showed that this novel gene expression regulation is influenced by environmental changes such as temperature variations or food composition. These results have important implications for the Drosophila community, namely the possible interpretation of false positive cells in clonal experiments. Additionally, they also highlight a level of mosaicism and plasticity in the brain, consistent with possible epigenetic regulation of fly chromosomes, which is different from other organs and tissues.",

    "abstract": "The Scar/WAVE complex is the major driver of actin nucleation at the plasma membrane, resulting in lamellipodia and membrane ruffles. While lamellipodia aid migration, membrane ruffles can generate macropinosomes - cup-like structures - important for nutrient uptake and regulation of cell surface receptor levels. How macropinosomes are formed and the role of the actin machinery in their formation and resolution is still not well understood. Mammalian CYRI-B is a recently described negative regulator of the Scar/WAVE complex by RAC1 sequestration, but its other paralogue, CYRI-A has not been characterised. Here we implicate CYRI-A as a key regulator of macropinosome maturation and integrin internalisation from the cell surface. We find that CYRI-A is recruited to nascent macropinosomes in a transient but distinct burst, downstream of PIP3-mediated RAC1 activation and the initial burst of actin assembly driving cup formation, but upstream of internalisation and RAB5 recruitment to the macropinosome. Together, our data place CYRI-A as a local suppressor of actin dynamics, enabling the resolution of the macropinocytic cup. The failure of CYRI-depleted cells to resolve their macropinocytic cups results in reduced integrin a5b1 internalisation, leading to enhanced spreading, invasive behaviour and anchorage-independent 3D growth. We thus describe a new role for CYRI-A as a highly dynamic regulator of RAC1 activity at macropinosomes, modulating homeostasis of integrin surface presentation, with important functional consequences.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial tubes are essential components of metazoan organ systems that control the flow of fluids and the exchange of materials between body compartments and the outside environment. The size and shape of the central lumen confer important characteristics to tubular organs and need to be carefully controlled. Here, we identify the small coiled-coil protein BBLN-1 as a regulator of lumen morphology in the C. elegans intestine. Loss of BBLN-1 causes the formation of bubble-shaped invaginations of the apical membrane into the cytoplasm of intestinal cells, and abnormal aggregation of the subapical intermediate filament (IF) network. BBLN-1 interacts with IF proteins and localizes to the IF network in an IF-dependent manner. The appearance of invaginations is a result of the abnormal IF aggregation, indicating a direct role for the IF network in maintaining lumen homeostasis. Finally, we identify bublin (BBLN) as the mammalian ortholog of BBLN-1. When expressed in the C. elegans intestine, bublin recapitulates the localization pattern of BBLN-1 and can compensate for the loss of BBLN-1. In mouse intestinal organoids, bublin localizes subapically, together with the IF protein keratin 8. Our results therefore may have implications for understanding the role of IFs in regulating epithelial tube morphology in mammals.\n\nSummaryWe identify BBLN-1 as an evolutionary conserved regulator of lumen morphology in the C. elegans intestine. Loss of bbln-1 causes intermediate filament network reorganization that induces severe apical morphology defects. We also identify bublin (BBLN) as the mammalian ortholog, which can compensate for the loss of BBLN-1 in C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke is caused by a disruption of the blood supply to the brain leading to neuronal cell death. Genetic studies of ischemic stroke have identified numerous gene variants that increase the risk to develop stroke. In stark contrast, genetic studies of stroke outcomes, such as the infarct territory size, are confounded by many uncontrollable variables, leading to a paucity of gene targets for treatment of an incipient stroke. Using genetically diverse inbred strains of mice and a surgically-induced model of ischemic stroke, we used quantitative trait locus mapping to identify novel gene targets modulating infarct size, which varies greatly across inbred strains. Although infarct size is largely determined by the extent of collateral vessel connection between arteries in the brain that enables reperfusion of the ischemic territory, we have identified strain pairs that do not vary in this phenotype, but which nonetheless exhibit large differences in infarct size. In this study we performed QTL mapping in mice from an intercross between two such strains, WSB/EiJ and C57BL/6J. We identified a strong locus on chromosome 8 that overlaps with a locus of similar direction and effect previously mapped in an intercross between C3H/HeJ and C57BL/6J strains. To identify causative genes within the overlapping genetic interval, we surveyed nonsynonymous coding SNPs and performed RNA sequencing data analysis for all three mapping strains. We identified Macrophage Scavenger Receptor 1 (Msr1) as a strong candidate gene that harbors multiple coding SNPs predicted to be damaging. Using Msr1-deficient mice, we demonstrated that cerebral infarct volume after stroke induction is dramatically increased in a strain background where reperfusion effects due to collateral vessels is blunted. Significantly, the identification of neuroprotective genes such as Msr1 provides new genes for future mechanistic studies of infarction following ischemic stroke and provides novel gene/protein targets for therapeutic development.\n\nAuthor summaryThe most common form of stroke arises when a blockage occurs in a blood vessel of the brain, thereby preventing delivery of oxygen and nutrients to areas supplied by the affected vessel, leading to tissue death. The main treatment for this form of stroke is medication to dissolve the blockage; however, more treatment options are required to better reduce the death and disability associated with stroke. In this study, we sought to identify genes that can decrease the amount of damage to brain tissue following a stroke, with a specific focus on examining genes that work to directly protect the neurons, rather than returning blood flow to the affected area. Since it is impossible to precisely control the nature of stroke and the genetic variability in humans, we used mice identify a genetic region that is associated with the amount of tissue damage following stroke. Within this genetic region, we identified a list of candidate genes, including the gene Msr1, which we found is important for controlling tissue damage in one genetic population of mice after stroke. The genes identified here require further follow-up to determine the impact on stroke outcomes and the usefulness of these candidates as therapeutic targets.",
