    "abstract": "While the physical interactions between the Golgi apparatus (Golgi) and lipid droplets (LDs) have been suggested through system-level imaging, the bona fide and functional Golgi-LD membrane contact sites (MCSs) remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we demonstrate that vacuolar protein sorting-associated protein 13B (VPS13B) mediates trans-Golgi network (TGN)-LD interactions. VPS13B is specifically accumulated at TGN-LD MCSs with its C-terminal region targeting LDs via an amphipathic helix while a putative WD40 module and a C-terminal Pleckstrin homology (PH) domain independently recognizing TGN via directly binding to Rab6. A putative lipid transfer domain (LTD) at the N-terminal portion of VPS13B binds glycerophospholipids in vitro. VPS13B suppression results in severe fragmentation of the TGN, an effect that can be almost completely rescued by the expression of VPS13B-LTD. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that VPS13B mediates lipid transfer at TGN-LD MCSs to maintain TGN integrity and function.",

    "abstract": "Intense development of Offshore Wind Farms (OFWs) has occurred in the North Sea with several more farms planned for the near future. These OFWs pose a threat to marine megafauna stressing the need to mitigate the impact of human activities. To help mitigating impacts, the Before After Gradient (BAG) design was proposed. We thus explored the use of the BAG method on megafauna sightings recorded at different distances from wind farms in the southern North Sea. We predicted intra-annual variability in species distribution, then correlated species distribution with the presence of operational OFWs and investigated the potential impact the operation of prospective OFWs may have on species distribution. Three patterns of intra-annual variability were predicted: species present most abundantly in spring, in winter or all year-round. We recommend that future OFW constructions be planned in summer and early fall to minimise impact on cetaceans and that offshore areas off northern France and Belgium be avoided to minimise impact on seabirds. Our prospective analysis predicted an increased or a decreased density with the operation of prospective OFWs. Prospective approaches, using e.g. a BAG design, are paramount to inform species conservation as they can forecast the likely responses of megafauna to anthropogenic disturbances.",

The PawS-Derived Peptides (PDPs) are produced from precursors of seed storage albumins in species of the daisy family. Here we report an unusually large PDP with two disulfide bonds, identified from seeds of Zinnia elegans. In water, synthetic PDP-23 forms a unique dimeric structure in which two monomers containing two {beta}-hairpins cross-clasp and enclose a hydrophobic core, creating a square prism. This stable dimer can be split and each monomer unfolds to a V-shape in micelles or organic solvents. This chameleonic character is unusual for disulfide-rich peptides and engenders PDP-23 with potential for cell delivery and accessing novel targets. We demonstrated this by conjugating a rhodamine dye to the PDP-23 scaffold, creating a stable, cell-penetrating inhibitor of the P-glycoprotein drug efflux pump.",

    "abstract": "Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the most common histological subtype of breast cancer, and nearly all ILC tumors express estrogen receptor alpha (ER). However, clinical and laboratory data suggest ILC are strongly estrogen-driven but not equally sensitive to anti-estrogen therapies. We hypothesized that ILC-specific ER transcriptional co-regulators mediate ER functions in ILC and anti-estrogen resistance, and profiled ER-associated proteins by mass spectrometry. Three ER+ ILC cell lines, MDA MB 134VI, SUM44PE, and BCK4, were compared to published data from ER+ invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cell lines, and we examined whether siRNA knockdown of identified proteins suppressed ER-driven proliferation in ILC cells. This approach found mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1 (MDC1), a key tumor suppressor in DNA damage response (DDR), as a putative novel ER co-regulator in ILC. We confirmed ER:MDC1 interaction was specific to ILC cell lines versus IDC cells, and found MDC1 knockdown suppressed ILC cell proliferation and suppressed tamoxifen resistance in MDA MB 134VI. Using RNA-sequencing, we found that in ILC cells, MDC1 knockdown broadly dysregulates the estrogen-driven ER transcriptome, with ER:MDC1 target genes enriched for hormone-response-elements in their promoter regions. Importantly, our data are inconsistent with MDC1 regulating ER via MDC1 DDR and tumor suppressor functions, but instead suggest a novel oncogenic role for MDC1 in mediating ER transcriptional activity as a co-regulator. Supporting this, in breast tumor tissue microarrays MDC1 protein was frequently low or absent in IDC or ER-ILC, but MDC1 loss is rare in ER+ ILC. ER:MDC1 interaction and MDC1 co-regulator functions may underlie cell type-specific ER functions in ILC, and serve as important biomarkers and therapeutic targets to overcome anti-estrogen resistance in ILC.",

    "abstract": "Dent disease 1 (DD1) is a rare X-linked renal proximal tubulopathy characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria (LMWP) and variable degree of hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis and/or nephrolithiasis with progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Although loss-of-function mutations in the gene CLCN5 encoding the electrogenic Cl-/H+ antiporter ClC-5, which impair endocytic uptake in proximal tubule cells, cause the disease, there is poor genotype-phenotype correlation and their contribution to proximal tubule dysfunction remains unclear. Here, in order to discover the mechanisms leading to proximal tubule dysfunction due to ClC-5 loss-of-function, we have generated and characterized new human cellular models of DD1 by silencing CLCN5 and introducing the ClC-5 pathogenic mutants V523del, E527D and I524K into the human proximal tubule-derived cell line RPTEC/TERT1. Depletion of CLCN5 or expression of mutant ClC-5 impairs albumin endocytosis, increases substrate adhesion and decreases collective migration, which correlates with a less differentiated epithelial phenotype. Interestingly, although all conditions compromised the endocytic capacity in a similar way, their impact on gene expression profiles was different. Our DNA microarray studies show that ClC-5 silencing or mutant re-introduction alter pathways related to nephron development, anion homeostasis, organic acid transport, extracellular matrix organization and cell migration, compared to control cells. Cells carrying the V523del ClC-5 mutation show the largest differences in gene expression vs WT cells, which is in agreement with the more aggressive clinical phenotype observed in some DD1 patients. Overall, this work emphasizes the use of human proximal tubule derived cell models to identify the molecular processes underlying ClC-5 deficiency.",

It is organized in an anterior-posterior global gradient, where posterior regions track changes in the environment, while anterior regions support abstract neural representations. However, whether the global gradient results from a smooth gradient that spans regions, or an overall trend emerging from the organized arrangement of functionally distinct regions is unknown. Here, we provide evidence to support the latter, by analyzing single-neuron activity along the DLPFC of non-human primates trained to perform a memory-guided saccade task with an interfering distractor. Additionally, we show that the posterior DLPFC plays a particularly important role in working memory, in sharp contrast with the lack of task-related responses in the anterior DLPFC.

    "abstract": "Recurrent connections are ubiquitous in the visual system, yet their role is less understood compared to that of feedforward visual processing. Occluded object recognition, an ethologically critical cognitive capacity, is thought to rely crucially on recurrent processing of visual information. Understanding how occluded object recognition depends on recurrent connections is thus of great importance. Here, using deep neural networks as our main tool, we performed comprehensive, controlled computational experiments to elucidate the potential role and necessity of recurrent computation in this task. While our comparison of neural network architectures revealed that sufficiently deep feedforward networks could easily outperform recurrent ones, contrary to previous studies, at the same time we found evidence that recurrent networks learn to \"explain away\" occlusion by leveraging information about the occluder, without being explicitly trained to do so. Furthermore, inspired by recent experimental studies, we demonstrated that a deep network model incorporating biologically inspired features was capable of faithfully reconstituting corrupted representations, even for heavily occluded objects, by taking global contexts into account through recurrent iterations. Lastly, we examined how occlusion shapes internal representations of neural networks optimized for object recognition. Although representations of occlusion-trained and non-occlusion-trained networks were nearly indistinguishable for unoccluded images, they exhibited highly divergent representations for occluded images. Our work sheds new light on computational roles of recurrent connections, a pervasive component of biological circuits, and how ethologically relevant conditions may strongly reshape neural representations supporting key cognitive functions.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to toxic metals and metalloids such as cadmium and arsenic results in widespread misfolding and aggregation of cellular proteins. How these protein aggregates are formed in vivo, the mechanisms by which they affect cells, and how cells prevent their accumulation during environmental stress is not fully understood. To find components involved in these processes, we performed a genome-wide imaging screen and identified yeast deletion mutants with either enhanced or reduced protein aggregation levels during arsenite exposure. Mutants with reduced aggregation levels were enriched for functions related to protein biosynthesis and transcription, whilst functions related to cellular signalling, metabolism, and protein folding and degradation were overrepresented among mutants with enhanced aggregation levels. On a genome-wide scale, protein aggregation correlated with arsenite resistance and sensitivity, indicating that many of the identified factors are crucial to safeguard protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and to protect against arsenite toxicity. Dedicated follow-up experiments indicated that intracellular arsenic is a direct cause of protein aggregation and that accurate transcriptional and translational control are crucial for proteostasis during arsenite stress. Specifically, we provide evidence that global transcription affects protein aggregation levels, that loss of transcriptional control impacts proteostasis through distinct mechanisms, and that translational repression is central to control protein aggregation and cell viability. Some of the identified factors are associated with pathological conditions suggesting that arsenite-induced protein aggregation may impact disease processes. The broad network of cellular systems that impinge on proteostasis during arsenic stress provides a valuable resource and a framework for further elucidation of the mechanistic details of metalloid toxicity and pathogenesis.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYHuman exposure to poisonous metals is increasing in many parts of the world and chronic exposure is associated with certain protein folding-associated disorders such as Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease. While the toxicity of many metals is undisputed, their molecular modes of action have remained unclear. Recent studies revealed that toxic metals such as arsenic and cadmium profoundly affect the correct folding of proteins, resulting in the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates. In this study, we used high-content microscopy to identify a broad network of cellular systems that impinge on protein homeostasis and cell viability during arsenite stress. Follow-up experiments highlight the importance of accurate transcriptional and translational control for mitigating arsenite-induced protein aggregation and toxicity. Some of the identified factors are associated with pathological conditions suggesting that arsenite-induced protein aggregation may impact disease processes.

Both groups were subjected to a water avoidance stress (WAS) test.\n\nResultsEight weeks after the WAS test, 25% of cchcr1 mice exhibited noninflammatory foci of alopecia on the dorsal skin.

In severe alopecia areata, changes in appearance significantly reduce the patients quality of life, but there is no established treatment. Its pathogenic mechanism is thought to cause an autoimmune disease of the hair bulb of growing hair. Many genes and factors associated with AA onset form a background that easily causes such an immune reaction, and the causative genes related to alopecia areata are being elucidated worldwide. We were able to identify the CCHCR1 gene as one of the causative genes by genome analysis. In this study, we created CCHCR1-deficient mice using Cre/loxP technology and confirmed that 25% of CCHCR1-deficient mice that underwent the WAS test for psychological stimulation developed hair loss similar to that observed in human alopecia areata. This suggests that the CCHCR1 gene is a disease susceptibility gene for alopecia areata.",

    "abstract": "Mixing gestating sows implies hierarchy formation and has detrimental consequences on welfare. The effects of social stress on the most vulnerable individuals may be underestimated and it is therefore important to evaluate welfare between individuals within groups. This study aimed at investigating the impact of social status and previous experience in the group on well-being of sows housed in large semi-static groups (20 groups of 46-91 animals). We assessed aggression (d0 (mixing), d2, d27, d29), body lesions (d1, d26, d84) and feeding order. Social status was based on the proportion of fights won during a 6-hr observation period between d0 and d2. Dominants (29%) were those who won more fights than they lost, Subdominants (25%) won fewer fights than they lost, Losers (23%) never won any fight in which they were involved while Avoiders (23%) were never involved in fights. Resident sows (70%) were already present in the group in the previous gestation while New sows (30%) were newly introduced at mixing. Subdominants and Dominants were highly involved in fights around mixing but this was more detrimental for Subdominants than Dominants, Losers and Avoiders since they had the highest body lesion scores at mixing. Avoiders received less non-reciprocal agonistic acts than Losers on d2 (P=0.0001) and had the lowest body lesion scores after mixing. However, Avoiders and Losers were more at risk in the long-term since they had the highest body lesions scores at d26 and d84. They were followed by Subdominants and then Dominants. New sows fought more (P<0.0001), tended to be involved in longer fights (P=0.075) around mixing and had more body lesions throughout gestation than Resident sows. Feeding order from one-month post-mixing was influenced both by the previous experience in the group and social status (P<0.0001). New sows, especially with a low social status, are more vulnerable throughout gestation and could serve as indicators of non-optimal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Western blot (WB) analysis is widely used, but obtaining consistent results can be problematic, particularly if all the treatments cannot be placed on one gel. Sources of variation were investigated by analyzing a set of samples which should produce statistically identical results, an approach commonly applied to analytical instruments. Test samples were lysates from RAW 264.7 murine macrophages treated with LPS to activate MAPK and NF-kB signaling targets. The resulting WB were probed for p-ERK, ERK, IkB{beta} and non-target protein levels. The first test set (Set 1) was a pooled cell lysate and the second (Set 2) four independently prepared lysates.\n\nAnalytical replicate data were generated by using multiple WB. Different normalization methods and sample groupings were applied to the density values and the resulting coefficients of variation (CV) and ratios of maximal to minimal values (Max/Min) were compared. Ideally, as the samples were identical (Set 1), or nearly so (Set 2), CVs would be 0 and the Max/Min 1. Results showed the raw density data variance was composed of variability between gel lanes and between gels; but only between gels after applying normalization calculations. CV and Max/Min were 30-70% and 1.5 for raw data, respectively. Common normalization methods, total lane protein, % Control, and p-ERK/ERK ratios, did not have the lowest CVs or Max/Min values. Some of these methods were counterproductive, greatly increasing CV and Max/Min. The best normalization methods resulted in CV and Max/Min value, as low as 5-10% and 1.1, respectively, but more typically 20-25% and 1.2. Application of these methods should allow reliable interpretation of complex experiments that require samples to be placed on multiple gels to provide results, even if fold changes in the target proteins are relatively modest.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTriple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is aggressive and treatment resistant. Evidence suggests that deficits in melatonin signaling increase TNBC risk: conditions that suppress melatonin increased incidence, low melatonin receptor expression correlates with worse prognosis, and high-dose melatonin can inhibit TNBC. Together this suggests that normalizing pineal melatonin could reduce TNBC incidence and/or mortality. The goal of this study was to determine whether small physiological deficits in melatonin alone, can increase risk for TNBC, and how  normal melatonin would be protective.\n\nMethodsThe effect of melatonin treatment on 4t1 cells in vitro was measured using the MTT cell viability assay, and gene expression of breast cancer and melatonin signaling markers. The effect of pineal gland status on 4t1 cell allografts was tested in C3Sn mice (Mus Musculus) with either an intact pineal (control) or surgical removal of the pineal causing a ~50% deficit in plasma melatonin. Orthotopic tumors were assessed by histopathology and metastasis by strain specific qPCR against 4t1 cell and host gDNA.\n\nResultsMelatonin treatment induced significant changes in gene expression, with a significant reduction in derived PAM50 Risk of Recurrence score (ROR in Not treated = 65.5 {+/-} 10.6 Mean SEM; Treated with 25pg/ml of melatonin 20.8 {+/-} 8.3; P = 0.008), suggesting melatonin treatment would improve prognosis. A ~50% reduction in plasma melatonin increased orthotopic tumors, but this was non-significant, and had no effect on metastasis from tail vein allograft.\n\nConclusionsPhysiological deficits in melatonin do alter the oncogenic status of 4t1 tumor cells but this has only a limited effect on growth and metastasis in vivo. Lack of significance in orthotopic tumor formation may be due to small sample size, and it is possible that any protective effect of melatonin occurs earlier in tumor development than we have tested.",

    "abstract": "The first step of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor biosynthesis in all eukaryotes is the addition of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) to phosphatidylinositol (PI) which is catalysed by a UDP-GlcNAc : PI 1-6 GlcNAc-transferase. This enzyme has been shown to be a complex of at least seven subunits in mammalian cells and a similar complex of homologous subunits has been postulated in yeast. Homologs of most of these mammalian and yeast subunits were identified in the Trypanosoma brucei predicted protein database. The putative catalytic subunit of the T. brucei complex, TbGPI3, was epitope tagged with three consecutive c-Myc sequences at its C-terminus. Immunoprecipitation of TbGPI3-3Myc followed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and anti-Myc Western blot showed that it is present in a ~240 kDa complex. Label-free quantitative proteomics were performed to compare anti-Myc pull-downs from lysates of TbGPI-3Myc expressing and wild type cell lines. TbGPI3-3Myc was the most highly enriched protein in the TbGPI3-3Myc lysate pull-down and partner proteins TbGPI15, TbGPI9, TbGPI2, TbGPI1 and TbERI1 were also identified with significant enrichment. Our proteomics data also suggest that an Arv1-like protein (TbArv1) is a subunit of the T. brucei complex. Yeast and mammalian Arv1 have been previously implicated in GPI biosynthesis, but here we present the first experimental evidence for physical association of Arv1 with GPI biosynthetic machinery. A putative E2-ligase has also been tentatively identified as part of the T. brucei UDP-GlcNAc : PI 1-6 GlcNAc-transferase complex.\n\nGraphical abstractFirst step of GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway in T.brucei BSF is catalysed by TbGPI3 complex.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Animals develop in unpredictable, variable environments. In response to environmental change some aspects of development adjust to generate plastic phenotypes. Other aspects of development, however, are buffered against environmental change to produce robust phenotypes. How organ development is coordinated to accommodate both plastic and robust developmental responses is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the steroid hormone ecdysone coordinates both plasticity of organ size and robustness of organ pattern in the developing wings of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Using fed and starved larvae that lack prothoracic glands, which synthesise ecdysone, we show that nutrition regulates growth both via ecdysone and via an ecdysone-independent mechanism, while nutrition regulates patterning only via ecdysone. We then demonstrate that growth shows a graded response to ecdysone concentration, while patterning shows a threshold response. Collectively, these data support a model where nutritionally-regulated ecdysone fluctuations confer plasticity by regulating disc growth in response to basal ecdysone levels, and confers robustness by initiating patterning only once ecdysone peaks exceeds a threshold concentration. This could represent a generalizable mechanism through which hormones coordinate plastic growth with robust patterning in the face of environmental change.",

    "abstract": "Fresh fruits and vegetables are invaluable for human health, but their quality deteriorates before reaching consumers due to ongoing biochemical processes and compositional changes. The current lack of any objective indices for defining \"freshness\" of fruits or vegetables limits our capacity to control product quality leading to food loss and waste. It has been hypothesized that certain proteins and compounds such as glucosinolates can be used as an indicator to monitor the freshness of vegetables and fruits. However, it is challenging to \"visualize\" the proteins and bioactive compounds during the senescence processes. In this work, we propose machine learning hyperspectral image analysis approaches for estimating glucosinolates levels to detect postharvest senescence in broccoli. Therefore, we set out the research to quantify glucosinolates as \"freshness-indicators\" which aid in the development of an innovative and accessible tool to precisely estimate the freshness of produce. Such a tool would allow for significant advancement in postharvest logistics and supporting the availability for high-quality and nutritious fresh produce.",

    "abstract": "The Bicoid (Bcd) protein is a primary determinant of early anterior-posterior (AP) axis specification in Drosophila embryogenesis. This morphogen is spatially distributed in an anterior-high gradient, and affects particular AP cell fates in a concentration-dependent manner. The early distribution and dynamics of the bicoid (bcd) mRNA, the source for the Bcd protein gradient, is not well understood, leaving a number of open questions for how Bcd positional information develops and is regulated.\n\nConfocal microscope images of whole early embryos, stained for bcd mRNA or the Staufen (Stau) protein involved in its transport, were processed to extract quantitative AP intensity profiles at two depths (apical - under the embryo surface but above the nuclear layer; and basal - below the nuclei). Each profile was quantified by a two- (or three-) exponential equation. The parameters of these equations were used to analyze the early developmental dynamics of bcd. Analysis of 1D profiles was compared with 2D intensity surfaces from the same images. This approach reveals strong early changes in bcd and Stau, which appear to be coordinated. We can unambiguously discriminate three stages in early development using the exponential parameters: pre-blastoderm, syncytial blastoderm and cellularization. Key features which differ in this period are how fast the first exponential (anterior component) of the apical profile drops with distance and whether it is higher or lower than the basal first exponential. We can further discriminate early and late embryos within the pre-blastoderm stage, depending on how quickly the anterior exponential drops. This relates to the posterior-wards spread of bcd in the first hour of development. Both bcd and Stau show several redistributions in the head cytoplasm, quite probably related to nuclear activity: first shifting inwards towards the core plasm, forming either protrusions (early pre-blastoderm) or round aggregations (early nuclear cleavage cycles, cc, 13 and 14), then moving to the embryo surface and spreading posteriorly. These movements are seen both with the 2D surface study and the 1D profile analysis. The continued spreading of bcd can be tracked from the time of nuclear layer formation (later pre-blastoderm) to the later syncytial blastoderm stages by the progressive loss of steepness of the apical anterior exponential (for both bcd and Stau). Finally, at the beginning of cc14 (cellularization stage) we see a distinctive flip from the basal anterior gradient being higher to the apical gradient being higher (for both bcd and Stau).\n\nQuantitative analysis reveals substantial (and correlated) bcd and Stau redistributions during early development, supporting that the distribution and dynamics of bcd mRNA are key factors in the formation and maintenance of the Bcd protein morphogenetic gradient. This analysis reveals the complex and dynamic nature of bcd redistribution, particularly in the head cytoplasm. These resemble observations in oogenesis; their role and significance have yet to be clarified. The observed co-localization during redistribution of bcd and Stau may indicate the involvement of active transport.",

    "abstract": "A key strategy for resolving the antibiotic resistance crisis is the development of new drugs with antimicrobial properties. The engineered cationic antimicrobial peptide WLBU2 (also known as PLG0206) is a promising broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound that has completed Phase I clinical studies. It has activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria including infections associated with biofilm. No definitive mechanisms of resistance to WLBU2 have been identified. Here, we used experimental evolution under different levels of mutation supply and whole genome sequencing (WGS) to detect the genetic pathways and probable mechanisms of resistance to this peptide. We propagated populations of wild-type and mutator Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of WLBU2 and performed WGS of evolved populations and clones. Populations that survived WLBU2 treatment acquired a minimum of two mutations, making the acquisition of resistance more difficult than for most antibiotics, which can be tolerated by mutation of a single target. Major targets of resistance to WLBU2 included the orfN and pmrB genes, previously described to confer resistance to other cationic peptides. More surprisingly, mutations that increase aggregation such as the wsp pathway were also selected despite the ability of WLBU2 to kill cells growing in a biofilm. The results show how the experimental evolution and WGS can identify genetic targets and actions of new antimicrobial compounds and predict pathways to resistance of new antibiotics in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Endosymbiosis was fundamental for the evolution of eukaryotic complexity. Endosymbiotic interactions can be dissected through forward and reverse-genetic experiments, such as RNA-interference (RNAi). However, distinguishing small (s)RNA pathways in a eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiotic interaction is challenging. Here, we investigate the repertoire of RNAi pathway protein-encoding genes in the model nascent endosymbiotic system, Paramecium bursaria-Chlorella spp. Using comparative genomics and transcriptomics supported by phylogentics, we identify essential proteome components of the small interfering (si)RNA, scan (scn)RNA, and internal eliminated sequence (ies)RNA pathways. Our analyses reveal that copies of these components have been retained throughout successive whole genome duplication (WGD) events in the Paramecium clade. We then validate feeding-induced siRNA-based RNAi in P. bursaria via knock-down of the splicing factor, u2af1, which we show to be crucial to host growth. Finally, using simultaneous knock-down paradox controls to rescue the effect u2af1 knock-down, we demonstrate that feeding-induced RNAi in P. bursaria is dependent upon a core pathway of host-encoded Dcr1, Piwi and Pds1 components. Our experiments confirm the presence of a functional, host-derived RNAi pathway in P. bursaria that generates 23-nt siRNA, validating use of the P. bursaria-Chlorella spp. system to investigate the genetic basis of a nascent endosymbiosis.",

    "abstract": "The concentration of atmospheric methane continues to increase with microbial communities controlling soil-atmosphere fluxes. While there is substantial knowledge of the diversity and function of organisms regulating methane production and consumption, the frequency and impact of interactions with viruses on their activity in soil is unknown. Metagenomic sequencing of soil microbial communities has enabled identification of linkages between viruses and hosts. However, determining host-virus linkages through sequencing does not determine whether a virus or a host are active. In this study, we identified active individual interactions in situ by following the transfer of assimilated carbon from active hosts to viruses. Using DNA stable-isotope probing combined with metagenomic analyses, we characterized methane-fueled microbial networks in acidic and neutral pH soils, specifically primary and secondary utilisers of carbon, together with the recent transfer of methane-derived carbon to viruses. Sixty-three percent of viral contigs from replicated soil incubations contained genes associated with known methanotrophic bacteria. Genomic sequences from 13C-enriched viruses were present in clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) arrays of multiple, closely-related Methylocystis populations, revealing differences in their history of viral interaction. Viruses infecting non-methanotrophic methylotrophs and heterotrophic predatory bacteria were also identified through the analysis of shared homologous genes, demonstrating that carbon is transferred to a diverse range of viruses associated with methane-fueled microbial food networks.",

    "abstract": "Occupancy models have been extended to account for either multiple spatial scales or species interactions in a dynamic setting. However, as interacting species (e.g., predators and prey) often operate at different spatial scales, including nested spatial structure might be especially relevant to models of interacting species. Here we bridge these two model frameworks by developing a multi-scale, two-species occupancy model. The model is dynamic, i.e. it estimates initial occupancy, colonization and extinction probabilities--including probabilities conditional to the other species presence. With a simulation study, we demonstrate that the model is able to estimate most parameters without marked bias under low, medium and high average occupancy probabilities, as well as low, medium and high detection probabilities, with only a small bias for some parameters in low-detection scenarios. We further evaluate the models ability to deal with sparse field data by applying it to a multi-scale camera trapping dataset on a mustelid-rodent predator-prey system. Most parameters are estimated with low uncertainty (i.e. narrow posterior distributions). More broadly, our model framework creates opportunities to explicitly account for the spatial structure found in many spatially nested study designs, and to study interacting species that have contrasting movement ranges with camera traps.",

In gene expression and alternative splicing analyses, it is important to identify transcript isoforms which code for different protein variants and to distinguish these from potential NMD substrates. Here, we present TranSuite, a pipeline of bioinformatics tools that address these challenges by performing accurate translations, characterizing alternative ORFs and identifying NMD and other features of transcripts in newly assembled and existing transcriptomes.

    "abstract": "The cell walls of fungi are critical for cellular structure and rigidity, but also serve as a major communicator to alert the cell of the changing environment. In response to stresses encountered in human hosts pathogenic fungi remodel their cell walls. Masking the b-1,3-glucan component of the cell wall is critical to escape detection by innate immune cells. We previously demonstrated that b-1,3-glucan is unmasked in response to host temperature stress when translatome reprogramming is defective in C. neoformans. Here, we used b-1,3-glucan unmasking as an output to identify signaling modules involved both in masking and translatome reprogramming in response to host temperature stress. We reveal that the High Osmolarity Glycerol (HOG) MAPK pathway is involved in translatome reprogramming and that mutants in this pathway display moderate unmasking when grown at 37{degrees}C. Additionally, we show that mutants of the Cell Wall Integrity/Mpk1 MAPK pathway extensively unmask b-1,3-glucan. While the CWI pathway does not impact translatome reprogramming, our data suggest it may play a role in the post-translational regulation of transcription factors that govern masking.\n\nImportanceCryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that causes devastating morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals. It possesses several virulence factors that aid in its evasion from the host immune system including a large polysaccharide capsule that cloaks the antigenic cell wall. Studies investigating how the cell wall is remodeled to keep this pathogen disguised in response to stress have been limited. We previously found that host temperature stress results in translatome reprogramming that is necessary for keeping the highly antigenic {beta}-(1,3)-glucan component masked. Our data reveals signaling modules that trigger these responses and suggest the points of regulations at which these pathways act in achieving masking. Understanding these mechanisms may allow for therapeutic manipulation that could promote immune recognition and clearance of this fungal pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Alternative RNA splicing results in multiple transcripts of the same gene, possibly encoding for different protein isoforms with different protein domains and functionalities. Whereas it is possible to manually determine the effect of a specific alternative splicing event on the domain composition of a particular encoded protein, the process requires the tedious integration of several data sources; it is therefore error prone and its implementation is not feasible for genome-wide characterization of domains affected by differential splicing. To fulfill the need for an automated solution, we developed the Domain Change Presenter (DoChaP), a web server for the visualization of the exon-domain association. DoChaP visualizes all transcripts of a given gene, the domains of the proteins that they encode, and the exons encoding each domain. The visualization enables a comparison between the transcripts and between the protein isoforms they encode for. The organization and visual presentation of the information makes the structural effect of each alternative splicing event on the protein structure easily identified. To enable a study of the conservation of the exon structure, alternative splicing, and the effect of alternative splicing on protein domains, DoChaP also facilitates an inter-species comparison of domain-exon associations. DoChaP thus provides a unique and easy-to-use visualization of the exon-domain association and its conservation between transcripts and orthologous genes and will facilitate the study of the functional effects of alternative splicing in health and disease.",

These properties are exploited in oncolytic virus (OV) therapy, where anti-viral responses enhance anti-tumour immunity. We have analysed the mechanism by which reovirus, an oncolytic dsRNA virus, modulates human NK cell activity. Reovirus activates NK cells in a type I interferon (IFN-I) dependent manner, resulting in STAT1 and STAT4 signalling in both CD56dim and CD56bright NK cell subsets. Gene expression profiling revealed the dominance of IFN-I responses and identified induction of genes associated with NK cell cytotoxicity and cell cycle progression, with distinct responses in the CD56dim and CD56bright subsets. However, reovirus treatment, acting via IFN-I, inhibited NK cell proliferative responses to IL-15 and was associated with reduced AKT signalling. In vivo, human CD56dim and CD56bright NK cells responded with similar kinetics to reovirus treatment, but CD56bright NK cells were transiently lost from the peripheral circulation at the peak of the IFN-I response, suggestive of their redistribution to secondary lymphoid tissue. These results show that reovirus modulates a spectrum of NK cell activity in vivo, encompassing direct action on tumour cells and the regulation of adaptive immunity. Such activity is likely to mirror NK cell responses to natural viral infection.",

    "abstract": "We live in a social world where we interact with each other. Neurofeedback (NFB) is an indispensable element for such interaction. Single-person NFB studies using electroencephalography (EEG) or other neuroimaging recordings were extensively reported. However, hyperscanning studies using inter-brain synchrony (IBS) as an NFB feature are completely unknown. In this study, we present two different experimental designs where IBS was fed visually back either as two balls approaching each other (so-called \"ball\" design) or as two pendula reflecting oscillatory activity of two participants (so-called \"pendulum\" design). The NFB was provided at two EEG frequencies (2.5 and 5 Hz) and manipulated by enhanced (fake condition) and inverse feedback. We showed that the participants were able to increase IBS by using NFB, especially when it was fed back at the theta frequency. Apart from the intra- and inter-brain coupling, other oscillatory activities (e.g., power spectral density, peak amplitude and peak frequency) changed during the task compared to rest. Moreover, all the measures showed specific correlations to the subjective post-survey item scores, reflecting subjective feeling and appraisal. We conclude that hyperscanning with IBS as a feedback feature seems to be an important tool to examine neural mechanisms of social interaction and collective behavior.",

    "abstract": "The complement system plays a role in the formation of sub-retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) deposits in early stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). But the specific mechanisms that connect complement activation and deposit formation in AMD patients are unknown, which limits the development of efficient therapies to reduce or stop disease progression. We have previously demonstrated that C3 blockage prevents the formation of sub-RPE deposits in a mouse model of EFEMP1-associated macular degeneration. In this study, we have used double mutant Efemp1R345W/R345W:C5-/- mice to investigate the role of C5 in the formation of sub-RPE deposits in vivo and in vitro. The data revealed that the genetic ablation of C5 does not eliminate the formation of sub-RPE deposits in vivo or in vitro. Contrarily, the absence of C5 in RPE cultures promotes complement dysregulation that results in increased activation of C3, which likely contributes to deposit formation even in the absence of EFEMP1-R345W mutant protein. The results also suggest that genetic ablation of C5 alters the extracellular matrix turnover through an effect on matrix metalloproteinases in RPE cell cultures. These results confirm that C3 rather than C5 could be an effective therapeutic target to treat early AMD.",

    "abstract": "Species associations can have profound effects on the realized habitat niche of species, indicating that habitat structure alone cannot fully explain observed abundances. To account for this aspect of community organization in niche modelling, we developed multi-species abundance models, incorporating the local effect of potentially associated species, alongside with environmental ones, targeting mainly forest management intensity. We coupled it with a landscape-scale analysis to further examine the role of management intensity in modifying the habitat niche in connection with the landscape context. Using empirical data from the Black Forest in southern Germany, we focused on the forest bird assemblage and in particular on the cavity nester and canopy forager guilds. We included in the analysis species that co-occur and for which evidences suggest association is likely. Our findings show that the local effect of species associations can moderate the effects of management intensity. We also found that species express a larger habitat niche breadth in intensively managed forests, depending on the landscape context. Species associations may facilitate the utilization of a broader range of environmental conditions under intensive forest management, which benefits some species over others. Such network of associations may be a relevant factor in the effectiveness of conservation-oriented forest management.",

    "abstract": "American populations are one of the most interesting examples of recently admixed groups, where ancestral components from three major continental human groups (Africans, Eurasians and Native Americans) have admixed within the last 15 generations. Recently, several genetic surveys focusing on thousands of individuals shed light on the geography, chronology and relevance of these events. However, despite the fact that gene-flow could drive adaptive evolution, it is not clear whether and how natural selection acted on the resulting genetic variation in the Americas.\n\nIn this study, we analysed the patterns of local ancestry of genomic fragments in genome-wide data for [~]6,000 admixed individuals from ten American countries. In doing so, we identified regions characterized by a Divergent Ancestry Profile (DAP), in which a significant over or under ancestral representation is evident.\n\nOur results highlighted a series of genomic regions with Divergent Ancestry Profiles (DAP) associated with immune system response and relevant medical traits, with the longest DAP region encompassing the Human Leukocyte Antigen locus. Furthermore, we found that DAP regions are enriched in genes linked to cancer-related traits and autoimmune diseases. Then, analyzing the biological impact of these regions, we showed that natural selection could have acted preferentially towards variants located in coding and non-coding transcripts, and characterized by a high deleteriousness score.\n\nTaken together, our analyses suggest that shared patterns of post admixture adaptation occurred at continental scale in the Americas, affecting more often functional and impactful genomic variants.",

We support this model with in-vivo human data acquired with a multi-offset AO scanning light ophthalmoscope. Then, using this finding, we provide a post-processing method, named Spatial frequency-based iMAge ReconsTruction (SMART), to optimally combine images from different off-axis detector orientations, significantly increasing the structural cellular contrast of in-vivo human retinal neurons such as conne inner segment, putative rods and retinal ganglion cells.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning models are commonly applied to human brain imaging datasets in an effort to associate function or structure with behaviour, health, or other individual phenotypes. Such models often rely on low-dimensional maps generated by complex processing pipelines. However, the numerical instabilities inherent to pipelines limit the fidelity of these maps and introduce computational bias. Monte Carlo Arithmetic, a technique for introducing controlled amounts of numerical noise, was used to perturb a structural connectome estimation pipeline, ultimately producing a range of plausible networks for each sample. The variability in the perturbed networks was captured in an augmented dataset, which was then used for an age classification task. We found that resampling brain networks across a series of such numerically perturbed outcomes led to improved performance in all tested classifiers, preprocessing strategies, and dimensionality reduction techniques. Importantly, we find that this benefit does not hinge on a large number of perturbations, suggesting that even minimally perturbing a dataset adds meaningful variance which can be captured in the subsequently designed models.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=65 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/423084v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bccd23org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13fcfe1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@68e987org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bbada9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG This paper demonstrates how Monte Carlo Arithmetic, a dataagnostic perturbation technique, can be used for dataset augmentation during the generation of structural connectomes and improve downstream phenotypic prediction.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "This study has three main objectives--two methodological and one summative, namely, further characterization of Homo naledi ([~]335-236 ka) to more firmly establish its evolutionary history. Using mathematically-corrected mesiodistal and buccolingual crown dimensions, the species was compared with samples of Pan troglodytes, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Paranthropus robustus, P. boisei, H. habilis, H. ergaster, H. erectus, H. heidelbergensis, H. neanderthalensis, and H. sapiens; the correction yields equivalently scaled samples unaffected by significant interspecific size differences. After initial cluster analysis, the data were used in tooth size apportionment analysis to determine how size is distributed relatively in each species dentition, while visualizing this variation in a sample scatterplot. The first main objective then, after quantitative coding, is evaluating the utility of these characters to estimate phylogenetic relationships, here using Bayesian inference with an Mkv model. The second objective, for the first time in paleoanthropological study, is estimating relationships using continuous characters, i.e., the scaled data, through Bayesian inference under a Brownian-motion model. This strategy facilitates maximum reception of potential phylogenetic signal. The final objective based on all analyses, though principally continuous Bayesian inference, is to elucidate the phylogeny of H. naledi. Relationships are largely congruent across methods and, with markedly higher node support, most of those inferred in prior systematic studies using qualitatively discretized traits. The present results place H. naledi as a sister taxon to H. habilis (node support [~]70-99%), with a plesiomorphic pattern of relative tooth size. It is nested within a clade comprising australopiths and early Homo dating 3.3 Ma to [~]800 ka, distinct from younger H. erectus through H. sapiens. This suggests that H. naledi originated well before the geological date range associated with the Dinaledi Chamber, from which the remains in this study were recovered, to represent a long-lived side branch in the genus.",

There is currently no widely used open-source pipeline to fit mathematical TPC models to data, which limits the transparency and reproducibility of the curve fitting process underlying applications of TPCs.\nC_LIO_LIWe present a new pipeline in R that currently allows for reproducible fitting of 24 different TPC models using non-linear least squares (NLLS) regression. The pipeline consists of two packages - rTPC and nls. multstart - that allow multiple start values for NLLS fitting and provides helper functions for setting start parameters. This pipeline overcomes previous problems that have made NLLS fitting and estimation of key parameters difficult or unreliable.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate how rTPC and nls.multstart can be combined with other packages in R to robustly and reproducibly fit multiple models to multiple TPC datasets at once. In addition, we show how model selection or averaging, weighted model fitting, and bootstrapping can easily be implemented within the pipeline.\nC_LIO_LIThis new pipeline provides a flexible and reproducible approach that makes the challenging task of fitting multiple TPC models to data accessible to a wide range of users.\nC_LI",

However, its potential for autoimmune diabetes, i.e. type 1 diabetes (T1D), is unknown.\n\nExperimental ApproachWe used two mouse models of T1D, streptozotocin (STZ)-injected and non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Eight-to-ten-week-old male C57Bl6/J mice were pre-treated with Abn-CBD (1mg/kg of body weight) or vehicle for 1 week, following STZ treatment, and euthanized 1 week later. Six-week-old female NOD mice were treated with Abn-CBD (0.1-1mg/kg) or vehicle for 12 weeks and then euthanized. Blood, pancreas, pancreatic lymph nodes and circulating T cells were collected and processed for analysis. Glycemia was also monitored.\n\nKey ResultsAbn-CBD decreased circulating proinflammatory cytokines, ameliorated islet inflammation and the autoimmune attack, showing a 2-fold decrease in CD8+ T cells infiltration and reduced Th1/Th2 ratio in pancreatic lymph nodes of STZ-injected mice. Mechanistically, Abn-CBD reduced intra-islet phospho-NF-{kappa}B and TXNIP. Concomitant reduction of islet cell apoptosis and intra-islet fibrosis were observed in Abn-CBD pre-treated mice compared to vehicle. In NOD mice, Abn-CBD reduced the expression of Ifng, Il21, Tnfa and Il10 while increased Il4 in circulating CD4+ T cells compared to vehicle, reducing the severity of insulitis and improving glucose tolerance.\n\nConclusion and ImplicationsAltogether, we found that Abn-CBD reduces intra-islet inflammation and delays the progression of insulitis in mouse models of T1D, preserving healthy functional islets. Hence, Abn-CBD and related compounds emerge as new candidates to develop pharmacological strategies to treat early stages of T1D.\n\nWHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN- Phytocannabinoids such as cannabidiol (CBD) have anti-inflammatory and glucose-lowering properties\n- The CBD derivative Abn-CBD ameliorates inflammation in various diseases and modulates beta cell function\n\n\nWHAT THIS STUDY ADDS- Abn-CBD reduces systemic and pancreatic inflammation in mice models of type 1 diabetes\n- Abn-CBD prevents beta cell damage and loss during type 1 diabetes onset\n\n\nCLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE- Synthetic cannabinoids emerge as potential treatment for type 1 diabetes",

A large number of previously unknown PEX orthologs were identified. We analysed all PEX proteins, their conservation and domain architecture and defined the minimum set of PEX proteins that is required to make a peroxisome. The molecular processes in peroxisome biogenesis in different organisms were put into context, showing that peroxisomes are not static organelles in eukaryotic evolution. Organisms that lack peroxisomes still contain a few PEX proteins, which probably play a role in alternative processes. Finally, the relationships between PEX proteins of two large families, the Pex11 and Pex23 families, were clarified, thereby contributing to the understanding of their complicated and sometimes incorrect nomenclature.
