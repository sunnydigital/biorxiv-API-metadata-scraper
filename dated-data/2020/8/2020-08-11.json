    "abstract": "AT-527, an orally administered double prodrug of a guanosine nucleotide analog, has been shown previously to be highly efficacious and well tolerated in HCV-infected subjects. Herein we report the potent in vitro activity of AT-511, the free base form of AT-527, against several coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. In normal human airway epithelial (HAE) cell preparations, the average concentration of AT-511 required to inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 by 90% (EC90) was 0.5 {micro}M, very similar to the EC90 for AT-511 against HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV in Huh-7 cells. No cytotoxicity was observed for AT-511 in any of the antiviral assays up to the highest concentration tested (100 {micro}M). Surprisingly, AT-511 was 30-fold less active against MERS-CoV. This differential activity may provide a clue to the apparent unique mechanism of action of the guanosine triphosphate analog formed from AT-527.",

    "abstract": "Mouse models with altered gonadotropin functions have provided invaluable insight into the functions of these hormones/receptors. Here we describe the repurposing of the infertile and hypogonadal LHR knockout mouse model (LuRKO), to address outstanding questions in reproductive physiology. Using crossbreeding strategies and physiological and histological analyses, we first addressed the physiological relevance of forced LHR homomerization in female mice using BAC expression of two mutant LHR, that have previously shown to undergo functional complementation and rescue the hypogonadal phenotype of male LuRKO mice. In female LuRKO mice, co-expression of signal and binding deficient LHR mutants failed to rescue the hypogonadal and anovulatory phenotype. This was apparently due to the low-level expression of the two mutant LHR and potential lack of LH/LHR-dependent pleiotropic signaling that has previously been shown to be essential for ovulation. Next, we utilized a mouse model overexpressing human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) with increased circulating  LH/hCG-like bioactivity to ~40 fold higher than WT females, to determine if high circulating hCG could reveal putative LHR-independent actions. No effects were found, thus, suggesting that LH/hCG mediate their gonadal and non-gonadal effects solely via LHR. Finally, targeted expression of a constitutively active FSHR progressed antral follicles to pre-ovulatory follicles and displayed phenotypic markers of enhanced estrogenic activity but failed to induce ovulation in LuRKO mice. This study highlights the critical importance and precise control of LHR and FSHR for mediating ovarian functions and of the potential re-purposing existing genetically modified mouse models in answering outstanding physiological questions.",

    "abstract": "The rat mid-thoracic contusion model has been used to study at-level tactile allodynia after spinal cord injury (SCI), one of the more common types of allodynia. An important advantage of this model is that not all animals develop allodynia and, therefore, it could be used to more clearly examine mechanisms that are strictly related to pain development separately from mechanisms related to the injury itself. However, how to separate those that develop allodynia from those that do not is unclear. The aims of the current study were to identify where allodynia and spasticity develop and use this information to identify metrics that separate animals that develop allodynia from those that do not in order study difference in their behavior. To accomplish these aims, a standardized grid was used to localize pain on the dorsal trunk and map it to thoracic dermatomes, providing for the development of a pain score that relied on supraspinal responses and separated subgroups of animals. Similar to human studies, the development of allodynia often occurred with the development of spasticity or hyperreflexia. Moreover, the time course and prevalence of pain phenotypes (at-, above-, or below level) produced by this model were similar to that observed in humans who have sustained an SCI. However, the amount of spared spinal matter in the injured cord did not explain the development of allodynia, as was previously reported. This approach can be used to study the mechanism underlying the development of allodynia separately from mechanisms related to the injury alone.",

    "abstract": "Ratooning is an important cultivation practice in sugarcane production around the world, with underground buds on the remaining stalk acting as the source for establishment of a subsequent ratoon crop. However, the optimal depth of cutting during harvest in terms of yield and root growth remains unknown. We carried out a two-year field study to determine the effects of three cutting depths (0, 5 and 10 cm below the surface) ratoon cane root and yield. Results showed that cutting to a depth of 5 cm increased the root fresh weight and root volume by 32-40% and 49-85%, respectively, compared to cutting depths of 0 and 10 cm. Remarkably, cutting to a depth of 5 cm also had a significant effect on the development of fine roots, which is closely linked to cane yield. The effect was particularly noticeable in terms of two root traits, root volume and the surface area of roots with a diameter of 1.0-2.0mm, and root length and the number of root tips in roots with a diameter of 0-0.5mm. As a result, a cutting depth of 5 cm below the surface increased cane yield by 35 and 25% compared to depths of 0 and 10 cm below the surface, respectively. Overall, these findings suggest that a cutting depth of 5 cm is optimal in terms of sugarcane yield, largely due to the enhanced effect on root traits, especially the development of fine roots. These findings will help optimize sugarcane ratoon management and improve the ratoon cycle.",

    "abstract": "The role of jasmonates (JAs) in primary root growth and development and in plant response to external stimuli is already known. However, its role in lateral root (LR) development remains to be explored. Our work identified methyl jasmonate (MeJA) as a key phytohormone in determining the branching angle of Arabidopsis LRs. MeJA inclines the LRs to a more vertical orientation, which was dependent on the canonical JAR1-COI1-MYC2, 3, 4 signalling. Our work also highlights the dual roles of light in governing LR angle. Light signalling enhances JA biosynthesis, leading to erect root architecture; whereas, glucose (Glc) induces wider branching angles. Combining physiological and molecular assays, we revealed that Glc antagonizes the MeJA response via TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) signalling. Moreover, physiological assays using auxin mutants, MYC2-mediated transcriptional activation of LAZY2, LAZY4 and auxin biosynthetic gene CYP79B2, and asymmetric distribution of DR5::GFP and PIN2::GFP pinpointed the role of an intact auxin mechanism required by MeJA for vertical growth of LRs. We also demonstrated that light perception and signalling are indispensable for inducing vertical angles by MeJA. Thus, our investigation highlights antagonism between light and Glc signalling and how they interact with JA-auxin signals to optimize the branching angle of LRs.",

    "abstract": "Vesicle-inducing protein in plastids (VIPP1) is essential for the biogenesis and maintenance of thylakoid membranes, which transform light into life. However, it is unknown how VIPP1 performs its vital membrane-shaping function. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine structures of cyanobacterial VIPP1 rings, revealing how VIPP1 monomers flex and interweave to form basket-like assemblies of different symmetries. Three VIPP1 monomers together coordinate a non-canonical nucleotide binding pocket that is required for VIPP1 oligomerization. Inside the rings lumen, amphipathic helices from each monomer align to form large hydrophobic columns, enabling VIPP1 to bind and curve membranes. In vivo point mutations in these hydrophobic surfaces cause extreme thylakoid swelling under high light, indicating an essential role of VIPP1 lipid binding in resisting stress-induced damage. Our study provides a structural basis for understanding how the oligomerization of VIPP1 drives the biogenesis of thylakoid membranes and protects these life-giving membranes from environmental stress.",

    "abstract": "How plants perceive water, especially during the critical stages of seed formation and germination, is key to their survival. During development and germination, seeds undergo large changes in water content, down to around 10% during maturation and up to 90% again within 24 hours of germination. We find the evolutionary conserved Arabidopsis plasma membrane protein PM19L1 to be an osmosensor, regulating dormancy and germination under osmotic stress. The PM19L1 protein structurally resembles the yeast osmosensor Sho1, with four transmembrane domains, and PM19L1 complements the osmosensitive sho1 mutant. Arabidopsis pm19l1 mutants have enhanced dormancy and reduced germination under salt and osmotic stress, and enhanced ABA levels. In a striking parallel to osmosensing in yeast, signalling downstream of PM19L1 involves a MAP kinase signal transduction pathway. PM19L1 is a positive regulator of ABI3, which promotes the late maturation of the seed, and negatively regulates the ABI4 and ABI5 dormancy- regulating transcription factors. These results have implications for the study of dormancy, drought, and salinity tolerance in crops, and may provide an insight into evolutionary adaptation of plants to a terrestrial environment.",

    "abstract": "Several plant viruses modulate vector fitness and behavior in ways that may enhance virus transmission. Previous studies have documented indirect, plant-mediated effects of tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) infection on the fecundity, growth and survival of its principal thrips vector, Frankliniella occidentalis, the western flower thrips. In this study, we conducted thrips performance and preference experiments combined with plant gene expression, phytohormone and total free amino acid analyses to identify tomato host responses to single and dual challenge with TSWV and F. occidentalis, compared to F. occidentalis alone, to address the question: do systemically-infected, symptomatic tomato plants modulate primary metabolic (photosynthesis and related physiological functions) and defense-related pathways to culminate into a more favorable environment for the vector. In a greenhouse setting, we documented a significant increase in the number of offspring produced by F. occidentalis on TSWV-infected tomato plants compared to mock-inoculated plants, and in choice test assays, females exhibited enhanced settling on TSWV-infected leaves. Microarray analysis combined with phytohormone signaling pathway analysis revealed that TSWV infection, regardless of thrips activity, robustly upregulated salicylic acid (SA) synthesis and downstream defense signaling pathway genes typically known to be associated with execution of defense against pathogens. TSWV alone downregulated a few jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive, anti-herbivore defense genes, however these were limited to wound-induced proteinase inhibitors. While this may indicate a subtle SA-JA antagonistic cross-talk in response to the virus, abscisic acid (ABA, upregulated) and auxin pathways (downregulated) were also perturbed by TSWV infection, regardless of F. occidentalis colonization, and may play roles in coordinating and dampening defense against the vector on infected plants. Frankliniella occidentalis alone triggered JA and ET pathways, phytohormones that have been reported to work cooperatively to enhance induced resistance to microbes and herbivores; however, on infected plants, ET remained unperturbed by the thrips vector. TSWV infection, alone or in combination with thrips, suppressed genes associated with photosynthesis and chloroplast function thereby significantly impacting primary metabolism of the host plant, and hierarchical cluster analysis and network analysis revealed that many of these genes were co-regulated with phytohormone defense signaling genes. Virus infection also altered genes related to cell wall organization which may render plants more susceptible to the penetration of thrips mouthparts. Lastly, TSWV infection increased expression of genes related to protein synthesis and degradation which is reflected in the increased total free amino acid content in virus-infected plants that harbored higher thrips populations. These results suggest coordinated gene networks that regulate plant primary metabolism and defense responses rendering virus-infected plants more conducive host for vectors, a relationship that is beneficial to the vector and the virus when considered within the context of the complex transmission biology of TSWV. To our knowledge this is the first study to identify global transcriptional networks that underlie the TSWV-thrips interaction as compared to a single mechanistic approach. Findings of this study increase our fundamental knowledge of host plant-virus-vector interactions and identifies underlying mechanisms of induced host susceptibility to the insect vector.",

This study was conducted to analyze the impact of retraction on citations received by retracted papers in two-time frames: during a post-retraction period equivalent to the time the article had been in print before retraction; and during the total post-retraction period.\n\nResultsThe results indicated an increase in post-retraction citations when compared with citations received pre-retraction. There were some exceptions however: first, citations received by articles published in first-quartile journals decreased immediately after retraction (p<0.05), only to increase again after some time had elapsed; and second, post-retraction citations decreased significantly in the case of articles that had received many citations before their retraction (p<0.05).\n\nConclusionsThe results indicate that retraction of articles has no impact on citations in the long term, since the retracted articles continue to be cited, thus circumventing their retraction. More effective mechanisms should be established to prevent the citation of retracted articles in scientific papers.\n\nMethodsQuasi-experimental, pre-post evaluation study. A total of 304 retracted original articles and literature reviews indexed in Medline fulfilled the exclusion criteria. Articles were required to have been published in Pubmed from January 2013 through December 2016 and been retracted between January 2014 and December 2016.

However, despite highly specific sgRNA-promoter binding, multiple sgRNAs still interfere with one another by competing for dCas9. We created a dCas9 regulator that adjusts dCas9 concentration based on sgRNAs demand, mitigating competition in CRISPRi-based logic gates. The regulators performance is demonstrated on both single-stage and layered CRISPRi logic gates and in two common E. coli strains. When a competitor sgRNA causes between two and ~25 fold-change in a logic gates input/output response without dCas9 regulator, the response is essentially unchanged when the regulator is used. The dCas9 regulator thus enables concurrent and independent operation of multiple sgRNAs, thereby supporting independent control of multiple genes.",

    "abstract": "Bistability is a common mechanism to ensure robust and irreversible cell cycle transitions. Whenever biological parameters or external conditions change such that a threshold is crossed, the system abruptly switches between different cell cycle states. Experimental studies indicate that the shape of the bistable response curve changes dynamically in time. Here, we show how such a dynamically changing bistable switch can provide a cell with better control over the timing of cell cycle transitions. Moreover, cell cycle oscillations built on bistable switches are more robust when the bistability is modulated in time. Our results are not specific to cell cycle models and may apply to other bistable systems in which the bistable response curve is time-dependent.\n\nAuthor summaryMany systems in nature show bistability, which means they can evolve to one of two stable steady states under exactly the same conditions. Which state they evolve to depends on where the system comes from. Such bistability underlies the switching behavior that is essential for cells to progress in the cell division cycle. A quick switch happens when the cell jumps from one steady state to another steady state. Typical of this switching behavior is its robustness and irreversibility. In this paper, we expand this viewpoint of the dynamics of the cell cycle by considering bistable switches which themselves are changing in time. This gives the cell an extra layer of control over transitions both in time and in space, and can make those transitions more robust. Such dynamically changing bistability can appear very naturally. We show this in a model of mitotic entry, in which we include a nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment. The activity of a crucial cell cycle protein follows a bistable switch in each compartment, but the shape of its response is changing in time as proteins are imported and exported from the nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Tissue homeostasis relies on orchestrated multicellular circuits, where interactions between different cell types dynamically balance tissue function. While single-cell genomics identifies tissues cellular components, deciphering their coordinated action remains a major challenge. Here, we tackle this problem through a new framework of multicellular programs: combinations of distinct cellular programs in different cell types that are coordinated together in the tissue, thus forming a higher order functional unit at the tissue, rather than only cell, level. We develop the open-access DIALOGUE algorithm to systematically uncover such multi-cellular programs not only from spatial data, but even from tissue dissociated and profiled as single cells, e.g., by single-cell RNA-Seq. Tested on spatial transcriptomes from the mouse hypothalamus, DIALOGUE recovered spatial information, predicted the properties of a cells environment only based on its transcriptome, and identified multicellular programs that mark animal behavior. Applied to brain samples and colon biopsies profiled by scRNA-Seq, DIALOGUE identified multicellular configurations that mark Alzheimers disease and ulcerative colitis (UC), including a program spanning five cell types that is predictive of response to anti-TNF therapy in UC patients and enriched for UC risk genes from GWAS, each acting in different cell types, but all cells acting in concert. Taken together, our study provides a novel conceptual and methodological framework to unravel multicellular regulation in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "The Tapanuli Orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis) is the most threatened great ape species in the world. It is restricted to an area of about 1,000 km2 of upland forest where fewer than 800 animals survive in three declining subpopulations. Through a historical ecology approach involving analysis of newspaper, journals, books and museum records from the early 1800s to 2009, we demonstrate that historically Pongo tapanuliensis inhabited a much larger area, and across a much wider range of habitat types than now. Its current Extent of Occurrence is between 2.5% and 5.0% of the historical range in the 1890s and 1940s respectively. A combination of historical fragmentation of forest habitats, mostly for small-scale agriculture, and unsustainable hunting likely drove various populations to the south, east and west of the current population to extinction. This happened prior to the industrial-scale forest conversion that started in the 1970s. Our findings indicate how sensitive P. tapanuliensis is to the combined effects of habitat fragmentation and unsustainable take-off rates. Saving this species will require prevention of any further fragmentation and killings or other removal of animals from the remaining population. Without concerted action to achieve this, the remaining populations of P. tapanuliensis are doomed to become extinct within several orangutan generations.",

    "abstract": "Human echinococcosis is present worldwide but it is in China that prevalence is the highest. Western China and in particular the Tibetan plateau is the region where the burden of echinococcosis is the most important. Dogs are a major carrier of echinococcosis and monitoring the presence of Echinococcus worms in dogs is therefore essential for efficiently controlling the disease. Detection kits based on three different technologies, i.e. sandwich ELISA, ELISA and gold immunodiffusion are currently marketed and used in China. The objective of this work was to assess the efficacy of these kits, in particular with respect to sensitivity and specificity. Four fecal antigen detection kits for canine echinococcosis covering the three technologies were obtained from companies and tested in parallel on 220 fecal samples. The results indicate that the performance is lower than expected, in particular in terms of sensitivity. The best results were obtained with the sandwich ELISA technology.

Controlling echinococcosis is a national priority and routine monitoring must be established. Dogs are the main carriers of echinococcosis and surveying Echinococcus worms in dogs is therefore a key issue. Commercial detection kits are currently in use in China for monitoring the presence of Echinococcosis in dogs. These kits are based on three different technologies, i.e. sandwich ELISA with two monoclonal antibodies, ELISA, and gold immunodiffusion. National survey programs are essential for the control of echinococcosis and it is thus very important to assess the efficacy of these kits, planned to be used for the national survey programs. The work was thus undertaken to assess this efficacy, in particular with respect to sensitivity and specificity. Four fecal antigen detection kits for canine echinococcosis covering the three technologies were obtained from companies and tested in parallel on 220 fecal samples. The performance was lower than expected, in particular for their sensitivity, which ranged from 51.5% to 83.9% with only two samples displaying a worm burden lower than 100. Three out of four kits showed non-specific cross-reactions with other parasites. The best results were obtained with the sandwich ELISA technology, whereas gold immunofiltration yielded the poorest results. However, in all cases, further development is strongly needed to improve the performance of these kits, which represent a key element for the control of echinococcosis.",

    "abstract": "The persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a major problem in managing tuberculosis (TB). Host-generated nitric oxide (NO) is perceived as one of the signals by Mtb to reprogram metabolism and respiration for persistence. However, the mechanisms involved in NO sensing and reorganizing Mtbs physiology are not fully understood. Since NO damages Fe-S clusters of essential enzymes, the mechanism(s) involved in regulating iron-sulfur (Fe-S) cluster biogenesis could help Mtb persist in host tissues. Here, we show that a transcription factor SufR (Rv1460) senses NO via its 4Fe-4S cluster and promotes persistence of Mtb by mobilizing the Fe-S cluster biogenesis system; suf operon (Rv1460-Rv1466). Analysis of anaerobically purified SufR by UV-visible spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and iron-sulfide estimation confirms the presence of a 4Fe-4S cluster. Atmospheric O2 and H2O2 gradually degrade the 4Fe-4S cluster of SufR. Furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis demonstrates that NO directly targets SufR 4Fe-4S cluster by forming a protein-bound dinitrosyl-iron-dithiol complex. DNase I footprinting, gel-shift, and in vitro transcription assays confirm that SufR directly regulates the expression of the suf operon in response to NO. Consistent with this, RNA- sequencing of Mtb{Delta}sufR demonstrates deregulation of the suf operon under NO stress. Strikingly, NO inflicted irreversible damage upon Fe-S clusters to exhaust respiratory and redox buffering capacity of Mtb {Delta}sufR. Lastly, Mtb{Delta} sufR failed to recover from a NO-induced non-growing state and displayed persistence defect inside immune-activated macrophages and murine lungs in a NO-dependent manner. Data suggest that SufR is a sensor of NO that supports persistence by reprogramming Fe-S cluster metabolism and bioenergetics.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) induces the expression of suf operon for Fe-S cluster biogenesis in response to nitric oxide (NO).\nC_LIO_LIWe found that a transcription factor SufR senses NO via its 4Fe-4S cluster and regulates the expression of the suf operon for Fe-S cluster biogenesis.\nC_LIO_LISufR-regulated Fe-S cluster biogenesis confers respiratory and redox features that promote recovery of Mtb from NO stress.\nC_LIO_LISufR activity is required to support the NO-dependent persistence of Mtb in macrophages and mice.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) is a phytopathogen that causes devastating bacterial canker in kiwifruit. Among five biovars defined by genetic, biochemical and virulence traits, Psa3 is the most aggressive and is responsible for the most recent reported outbreaks, but the molecular basis of its heightened virulence is unclear. We therefore designed the first P. syringae multi-strain whole-genome microarray, encompassing biovars Psa1, Psa2 and Psa3 and the well-established model P. syringae pv. tomato, and analyzed early bacterial responses to an apoplast-like minimal medium. Transcriptomic profiling revealed (i) the strong activation in Psa3 of all hrp/hrc cluster genes, encoding components of the type III secretion system required for bacterial pathogenicity and involved in responses to environmental signals; (ii) potential repression of the hrp/hrc cluster in Psa2; and (iii) activation of flagellum-dependent cell motility and chemotaxis genes in Psa1. The detailed investigation of three gene families encoding upstream regulatory proteins (histidine kinases, their cognate response regulators, and proteins with diguanylate cyclase and/or phosphodiesterase domains) indicated that c-di-GMP may be a key regulator of virulence in Psa biovars. The gene expression data were supported by the quantification of biofilm formation. Our findings suggest that diverse early responses to the host apoplast, even among bacteria belonging to the same pathovar, can lead to different virulence strategies and may explain the differing outcomes of infections. Based on our detailed structural analysis of hrp operons, we also propose a revision of hrp cluster organization and operon regulation in P. syringae.\n\nAuthor summaryPseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) is a bacterial pathogen that infects kiwifruit crops. Recent outbreaks have been particularly devastating due to the emergence of a new biovar (Psa3), but the molecular basis of its virulence is unknown so it is difficult to develop mitigation strategies. In this study, we compared the gene expression profiles of Psa3 and various less-virulent biovars in an environment that mimics early infection, to determine the basis of pathogenicity. Genes involved in the assembly and activity of the type III secretion system, which is crucial for the secretion of virulence effectors, were strongly upregulated in Psa3 while lower or not expressed in the other biovars. We also observed the Psa3-specific expression of genes encoding upstream signaling components, confirming that strains of the same bacterial pathovar can respond differently to early contact with their host. Finally, our data suggested a key role in Psa virulence switch ability for the small chemical signaling molecule c-di-GMP, which suppresses the expression of virulence genes. This effect of c-di-GMP levels on Psa3 virulence should be further investigated and confirmed to develop new mitigation methods to target this pathway.",

    "abstract": "The increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in clinical and environmental settings has been seen globally as a complex public health challenge, mostly in the developing nations where they significantly impact on freshwater used for a variety of domestic purposes and irrigation. In this paper, we give details as regards the occurrence and antibiogram signatures of Enterobacteriaceae community in Tsomo and Tyhume rivers within the Eastern Cape Province, Republic of South Africa using standard methods. Average distribution of the presumptive Enterobacteriaceae in the rivers ranged from 1 x 102 CFU/100ml to 1.95 x 104 CFU/100ml. We confirmed 56 (70.8%) out of 79 presumptive Enterobacteriaceae isolated being species within the family Enterobacteriaceae through the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight technique. From this, Citrobacter-, Enterobacter-, Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli were selected (n=40) due to their pathogenic potentials for antibiogram profiling. The results of the antibiotic susceptibility testing gave a revelation that all the isolates were phenotypically multidrug-resistant while resistance against ampicillin (95%), tetracycline and doxycycline (88%) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (85%) antibiotics were most prevalent. The Multiple Antibiotic Resistance indices stretched from 0.22 to 0.94, with the highest index observed in a C. freundii isolate. Molecular characterisation using the PCR technique revealed the dominance of blaTEM (30%; 12/40) among the ten groups of extended-spectrum {beta}-lactamase (ESBL) genes assayed. The prevalence of others was blaCTX-M genes including group 1, 2 and 9 (27.5%), blaSHV (20%), blaKPC (17.6%), blaGES (11.8%), blaIMP (11.8%), blaVIM (11.8%), blaOXA-1-like (10%), blaPER (2.5%), blaOXA-48-like (5.9%) and blaVEB (0%). From the six plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC) genes investigated blaACC, blaEBC, blaFOX, blaCIT, blaDHA and blaMOX, only the first four were detected. In this category, the most dominant was blaEBC, with 18.4% (7/38). The prevalence of the non-{beta}-lactamases include tetA (33.3%), tetB (30.5%), tetC (2.8%), tetD (11.1%), tetK (0%), tetM (13.9%), catI (12%), catII (68%), sulI (14.3%), sulII (22.8%) and aadA (8.3%). Notably, a C. koseri harboured 42.8% (12/28) of the genes assayed for which includes five of the ESBL genes (including the only blaPER detected in this study), two of the pAmpC resistance genes (blaACC and blaCIT) and five of the non-{beta}-lactamase genes. To the best of our knowledge, this study gives the first report on C. koseri exhibiting co-occurrence of ESBL/AmpC {beta}-lactamase genes from the environment. The detection of a blaPER producing Citrobacter spp. in this study is remarkable. These findings provide evidence that freshwater serves as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance determinants which can then be easily transferred to human beings via the food chain and water.",

    "abstract": "PspC and Hic proteins of Streptococcus pneumoniae are some of the most variable microbial immune evasion proteins identified to date. Due to structural similarities and conserved binding profiles it was assumed over a long time that these pneumococcal surface proteins represent a protein family, comprising eleven subgroups. Recently, however, by evaluating more proteins larger diversity of individual proteins became apparent. In contrast to previous assumptions a pattern evaluation of six PspC and five Hic variants, each representing one of the previously defined subgroups, revealed distinct structural and likely functionally regions of the proteins, and identified nine new domains and new domain alternates. Several domains are unique to PspC and Hic variants, while other domains are shared with other S. pneumoniae and bacterial virulent determinants. This understanding improved pattern evaluation on the level of full-length proteins, allowed a sequence comparison on the domain level and furthermore identified domains with a modular composition. This novel concept allows a better characterization of variability, and modular domain composition of individual proteins, enables a structural and functional characterization at the domain level and furthermore shows substantial structural differences between PspC and Hic proteins. Such knowledge will also be useful for molecular strain typing, characterizing PspC and Hic proteins from new clinical S. pneumoniae strains, including those derived from patients who present with pneumococcal hemolytic uremic syndrome. Furthermore this analysis explains the role of multifaceted intact PspC and Hic proteins in pathogen host interactions. and can provide a basis for rational vaccine design.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe human pathobiont Streptococcus pneumoniae expresses highly polymorphic PspC or Hic proteins, which bind a repertoire of host immune regulators and combine antigenic variation with conserved immune evasion features. Understanding domain composition of each protein encoded by more than 60 000 pspC or hic genes deposited in the data banks defines their diversity, a role in immune escape and can furthermore delineate structure function approach for single protein domains. PspC and Hic proteins show variable domain composition and sequence diversity, which explain differences in binding of human regulators and likely in immune escape. The results of our analyses provide insights in the domain composition of these diverse immune evasion proteins, identifies new domains, defines domains which are unique to PspC or Hic variants, and identifies domains which are shared with other bacterial immune evasion proteins. These data have implication on cell wall attachment, surface distribution and in immune escape.",

    "abstract": "Spore activation is one of the most important developmental decisions in fungi as it initiates the transition from dormant and stress resistant cells to vegetative cells. Because in many species mating follows spore activation and germination, signals that trigger this developmental transition can also contribute to species reproductive barriers. Here we examine the biochemical signals triggering spore activation in a natural species complex of budding yeast, Saccharomyces paradoxus (lineages SpA, SpB, SpC and SpC*). We first demonstrate that we can quantitatively monitor spore activation in these closely related lineages. Second, we dissect the composition of culture media to identify components necessary and/or sufficient to activate spores in the four lineages. We show that, contrary to expectation, glucose is necessary but not sufficient to trigger spore activation. We also show that two of the North American lineages (SpC and SpC*) diverge from the other North American (SpB) and European (SpA) lineages in terms of germination signal as their spore activation requires inorganic phosphate. Our results show that the way budding yeast interpret environmental conditions during spore activation diverged among closely related and incipient species, which means that it may play a role in their ecological differentiation and reproductive isolation.",

    "abstract": "Horizontal gene transfer is an important mechanism which facilitates bacterial populations in overcoming antimicrobial treatment. In this study, a total of 120 Escherichia coli and 62 Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica isolates were isolated from poultry farms in Alberta. Fourteen serovars were identified among Salmonella isolates. Thirty one percent of E. coli isolates were multiclass drug resistant (resistant to [&ge;] 3 drug classes), while only about 16% of Salmonella isolates were multiclass drug resistant. Among those, eight E. coli isolates had an AmpC-type phenotype, and one Salmonella isolate had an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-type {beta}-lactamase phenotype. We identified both AmpC-type (blaCMY-2) and ESBL-type (blaTEM) genes in both E. coli and Salmonella isolates. Plasmids from eight of nine E. coli and Salmonella isolates were transferred to recipient strain E. coli J53 through conjugation. Transferable plasmids in above total eight E. coli and Salmonella isolates were also transferred into a lab-made sodium azide-resistant Salmonella recipient through conjugation. The class 1 integrase gene, int1, was detected on plasmids from two E. coli isolates. Further investigation of class 1 integron cassette regions revealed the presence of an aadA gene encoding streptomycin 3\"-adenylyltransferase, an aadA1a/aadA2 gene encoding aminoglycoside 3\"-O-adenyltransferase, and a putative adenylyltransferase gene.

Here, we integrate high-dimensional single-cell approaches to quantify viral and host RNA and protein expression signatures using de novo infection with a well-characterized model gammaherpesvirus. While infected cells demonstrated genome-wide transcription, individual cells revealed pronounced variation in gene expression, with only 9 of 80 annotated viral open reading frames uniformly expressed in all cells, and a 1000-fold variation in viral RNA expression between cells. Single-cell analysis further revealed positive and negative gene correlations, many uniquely present in a subset of cells. Beyond variation in viral gene expression, individual cells demonstrated a pronounced, dichotomous signature in host gene expression, revealed by measuring host RNA abundance and post-translational protein modifications.

    "abstract": "Carboxysomes are protein-based organelles essential for carbon fixation in cyanobacteria and proteobacteria. Previously, we showed that the cyanobacterial nucleoid is utilized as a surface for the equidistant-spacing of {beta}-carboxysomes across cell lengths by a two-component system (McdAB) in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. More recently, we found that McdAB systems are widespread among {beta}-cyanobacteria, which possess {beta}-carboxysomes, but are absent in -cyanobacteria, which possess structurally distinct -carboxysomes. Since cyanobacterial -carboxysomes are thought to have arisen in proteobacteria and were subsequently horizontally transferred into cyanobacteria, this raised the question whether -carboxysome containing proteobacteria possess a McdAB system for positioning -carboxysomes. Here, using the model chemoautotrophic proteobacterium H. neapolitanus, we show that a McdAB system distinct from that of {beta}-cyanobacteria operates to position -carboxysomes across cell lengths. We further show that this system is widespread among -carboxysome containing proteobacteria and that cyanobacteria likely inherited an -carboxysome operon from a proteobacterium lacking the mcdAB locus. These results demonstrate that McdAB is a cross-phylum two-component system necessary for positioning - and {beta}-carboxysomes. The findings have further implications for understanding the positioning of other bacterial protein-based organelles involved in diverse metabolic processes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe soil bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei is the causative agent of melioidosis. It kills up to 40% of cases and contributes to human morbidity and mortality in many tropical and sub-tropical countries. As no vaccines are currently available, prevention is the key health policy and is achieved by avoiding direct contact with soil and standing water. The pathogen notoriously persists in ranges of environmental conditions which make disease prevention difficult. We aimed to scan B. pseudomallei genomes for signals of evolutionary adaptations that allow it to thrive across environmental conditions, which should ultimately inform prevention policy.\n\nMethodsWe conducted three layers of analyses: a genome-wide epistasis and co-selection study (GWES) on 2,011 B. pseudomallei genomes to detect signals of co-selection; gene expression analyses across 82 diverse physical, chemical, biological and infectious conditions to identify specific conditions in which such selection might have acted; and gene knockout assays to confirm the function of the co-selection hotspot.\n\nFindingsWe uncovered 13,061 mutation pairs in distinct genes and non-coding RNA that have been repeatedly co-selected through B. pseudomallei evolution. Genes under co-selection displayed marked expression correlation when B. pseudomallei was subjected to physical stress conditions including temperature stress, osmotic stress, UV radiation, and nutrient deprivation; highlighting these conditions as the major evolutionary driving forces for this bacterium. We identified a putative adhesin (BPSL1661) as a hub of co-selection signals, experimentally confirmed the role of BPSL1661 under nutrient deprivation, and explored the functional basis of the co-selection gene network surrounding BPSL1661 in facilitating bacterial survival under nutrient depletion.\n\nInterpretationOur findings suggest that B. pseudomallei has a selective advantage to survive nutrient-limited conditions. Anthropogenic activities such as shifting cultivation systems with more frequent rotations of cropping and shortened fallow periods or continuous cultivation of cash crops could directly or indirectly contribute to loss of soil nutrient; these may lead to the preferential survival of B. pseudomallei and a subsequent rise of melioidosis. Successful disease control for melioidosis needs to consider improving environmental health in addition to current preventive efforts.\n\nFundingWellcome Trust, European Research Council, UK Department of Health, Thailand Research Fund and Khon Kaen University\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe searched PubMed with terms (co-selection AND bacteria AND population) with no date or language restrictions from database inception until April 11, 2021. We identified 44 publications of which four were conducted at a genome-wide scale. These four studies were performed on human-restricted pathogens, detected co-selection of antibiotic resistance gene networks which highlight the use of antibiotics as major selection pressures and further inform treatment options. However, none of these studies were performed on Burkholderia pseudomallei or other opportunistic pathogens that have been adapted to both natural and host environments. The selection pressures exerted on these pathogens and the genetic determinants allowed for their adaptations remain unclear, which limit our understanding on the bacterial biology and the information used for disease control.\n\nAdded value of this studyBased on genomes of 2,011 B. pseudomallei collected from melioidosis endemic areas, we identified and confirmed genetic signals for co-selection. Using transcriptome profiling covering a broad spectrum of conditions and exposures, we showed that genes under co-selection displayed marked expression correlation under physical stress conditions with the gene at the co-selection hotspot conditionally expressed under nutrient starvation. Furthermore, we experimentally validated the function of the hotspot gene and demonstrated that unlike host-restricted pathogens, the B. pseudomallei co-selection network does not facilitate host infection but is focused on bacterial survival in a harsh environment, particularly under nutrient depletion. Aside from providing a data resource, the study also showcases the power of combined genetics, transcriptomics and functional analysis as a tool for biology discovery.\n\nImplications of all available evidenceOur findings provide evolutionary and biological evidence for preferential survival of B. pseudomallei under nutrient starvation. Agricultural practice that induces soil loss, which is not uncommon in melioidosis endemic areas has been linked to soil nutrient depletion and may contribute to the prevalence of B. pseudomallei and a consequent rise of melioidosis in these regions. Successful melioidosis control has to consider environmental health in addition to existing prevention policy.",

    "abstract": "Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a food-borne pathogen that causes diarrheal disease and the potentially lethal hemolytic uremic syndrome. We used an infant rabbit model of EHEC infection that recapitulates many aspects of human intestinal disease to comprehensively assess colonic transcriptional responses to this pathogen. Cellular compartment-specific RNA-sequencing of intestinal tissue from animals infected with EHEC strains containing or lacking Shiga toxins (Stx) revealed that EHEC infection elicits a robust response that is dramatically shaped by Stx, particularly in epithelial cells. Many of the differences in the transcriptional responses elicited by these strains were in genes involved in immune signaling pathways, such as IL23A, and coagulation, including F3, the gene encoding Tissue Factor. RNA FISH confirmed that these elevated transcripts were found almost exclusively in epithelial cells. Collectively, these findings suggest that within the intestine, Stx primarily targets epithelial cells, and that the potent Stx-mediated modulation of innate immune signaling skews the host response to EHEC towards type 3 immunity.\n\nSignificance StatementEnterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a potentially lethal foodborne pathogen. During infection, EHEC releases a potent toxin, Shiga toxin (Stx), into the intestine, but there is limited knowledge of how this toxin shapes the host response to infection. We used an infant rabbit model of infection that closely mimics human disease to profile intestinal transcriptomic responses to EHEC infection. Comparisons of the transcriptional responses to infection by strains containing or lacking Stx revealed that this toxin markedly remodels how the epithelial cell compartment responds to infection. Our findings suggest that Stx biases the intestinal innate immune response to EHEC and provide insight into the complex host-pathogen dialogue that underlies disease.",

However, the intricate details associated with Hfq-RNA biogenesis are still unclear. Previously, we reported that the stringent response regulator, RelA is a functional partner of Hfq that facilitates Hfq-mediated sRNA-mRNA regulation in vivo and induces Hfq hexamerization in vitro. Here, for the first time we show that RelA-mediated Hfq hexamerization requires an initial binding of RNA, preferably sRNA to Hfq monomers. By interacting with a Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence (GGAG) in the sRNA, RelA stabilizes the initially unstable complex of RNA bound-Hfq monomer, enabling the attachment of more Hfq subunits to form a functional hexamer. Overall, our study showing that RNA binding to Hfq monomers is at the heart of RelA-mediated Hfq hexamerization, challenges the previous concept that only Hfq hexamers can bind RNA.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 emerged in late 2019 and resulted in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Several animal models have been rapidly developed that recapitulate the asymptomatic to moderate disease spectrum. Now, there is a direct need for additional small animal models to study the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 and for fast-tracked medical countermeasure development. Here, we show that transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV-2 receptor (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [hACE2]) under a cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection resulted in a dose-dependent lethal disease course. After inoculation with either 104 TCID50 or 105 TCID50, the SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in rapid weight loss in both groups and uniform lethality in the 105 TCID50 group. High levels of viral RNA shedding were observed from the upper and lower respiratory tract and intermittent shedding was observed from the intestinal tract. Inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in upper and lower respiratory tract infection with high infectious virus titers in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. The observed interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary pathology, with SARS-CoV-2 replication evident in pneumocytes, were similar to that reported in severe cases of COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 infection resulted in macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration in the lungs and upregulation of Th1 and proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. Extrapulmonary replication of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of several animals at 7 DPI but not at 3 DPI. The rapid inflammatory response and observed pathology bears resemblance to COVID-19. Taken together, this suggests that this mouse model can be useful for studies of pathogenesis and medical countermeasure development.\n\nAuthors SummaryThe disease manifestation of COVID-19 in humans range from asymptomatic to severe. While several mild to moderate disease models have been developed, there is still a need for animal models that recapitulate the severe and fatal progression observed in a subset of patients. Here, we show that humanized transgenic mice developed dose-dependent disease when inoculated with SARS-CoV-2, the etiological agent of COVID-19. The mice developed upper and lower respiratory tract infection, with virus replication also in the brain after day 3 post inoculation. The pathological and immunological diseases manifestation observed in these mice bears resemblance to human COVID-19, suggesting increased usefulness of this model for elucidating COVID-19 pathogenesis further and testing of countermeasures, both of which are urgently needed.",

Previous neurophysiological studies have shown enhanced representations for the dichotomy of familiar vs. unfamiliar faces. As familiarity is a spectrum, however, any neural correlate should reflect graded representations for more vs. less familiar faces along the spectrum. By systematically varying familiarity across stimuli, we show a neural familiarity spectrum using electroencephalography. We then evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of familiar face recognition across the brain. Specifically, we developed a novel informational connectivity method to test whether peri-frontal brain areas contribute to familiar face recognition. Results showed that feed-forward flow dominates for the most familiar faces and top-down flow was only dominant when sensory evidence was insufficient to support face recognition. These results demonstrate that perceptual difficulty and the level of familiarity influence the neural representation of familiar faces and the degree to which peri-frontal neural networks contribute to familiar face recognition.",

    "abstract": "Heavy and frequent use of cannabis during adolescence increases the risk of developing psychiatric disorders. However, the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this vulnerability remain largely unknown. Here, we explore whether adolescent vulnerability to long-term behavioral effects of cannabis is modulated by Reelin, a gene implicated in the development of the brain and of psychiatric disorders. To this aim, heterozygous Reeler (HR) mice, that express reduced level of Reelin, were chronically exposed during adolescence to high doses (10mg/kg) of {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a major psychoactive component of cannabis. Mice were tested in early adulthood with multiple behavioral assays, including working memory, social interaction, locomotor activity, anxiety-like responses, stress reactivity, and pre-pulse inhibition. Compared to wild-type (WT), HR mice treated with THC showed impaired social behaviors, elevated disinhibitory phenotypes and increased responsiveness to aversive situations, in a sex-specific manner. Independent of THC exposure, HR mice also spent more time exploring unfamiliar objects, indicating that Reelin modulates novelty seeking behavior. To identify the neuronal ensemble underlying this elevated novelty seeking in HR mice, we mapped the regional brain expression of the immediate early gene, Fos, in mice exposed to novel objects. HR mice exhibited reduced neuronal activation in the lateral septum, a subcortical brain structure implicated in emotions, cognition and reward processes. Overall, these findings show that (1) Reelin deficiency influences behavioral abnormalities caused by heavy consumption of THC during adolescence, and (2) that Reelin plays a role in the neurobiological mechanisms underlying disinhibitory behaviors, such as novelty seeking.\n\nSignificant StatementThe link between cannabis abuse and the development psychiatric disorders, especially in adolescents, makes understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cannabis effects on the brain a significant biomedical problem. Reelin is a key signaling molecule in the development of the adolescent brain and of psychiatric disorders, but its role in modulating the behavioral changes induced by cannabis remain unknown. Here, we report an interaction between Reelin deficiency and chronic adolescent exposure to THC, a major psychoactive component of cannabis. This interaction led to cognitive deficits, disinhibitory behaviors and altered emotional reactivity in mice, in a sex-specific manner. These experiments are the first to establish a link between Reelin signaling and the endocannabinoid system targeted by THC.",

    "abstract": "Viral interferon (IFN) antagonist proteins mediate evasion of IFN-mediated innate immunity and are often multifunctional, having distinct roles in viral replication processes. Functions of the Ebola virus (EBOV) IFN antagonist VP24 include nucleocapsid assembly during cytoplasmic replication and inhibition of IFN-activated signalling by STAT1. For the latter, VP24 prevents STAT1 nuclear import via competitive binding to nuclear import receptors (karyopherins). Many viral proteins, including proteins from viruses with cytoplasmic replication cycles, interact with the trafficking machinery to undergo nucleocytoplasmic transport, with key roles in pathogenesis. Despite established karyopherin interaction, the nuclear trafficking profile of VP24 has not been investigated. We find that VP24 becomes strongly nuclear following overexpression of karyopherin or inhibition of nuclear export pathways. Molecular mapping indicates that cytoplasmic localisation of VP24 depends on a CRM1-dependent nuclear export sequence at the VP24 C-terminus. Nuclear export is not required for STAT1 antagonism, consistent with competitive karyopherin binding being the principal antagonistic mechanism while export mediates return of nuclear VP24 to the cytoplasm for replication functions. Thus, nuclear export of VP24 might provide novel targets for antiviral approaches.\n\nImportanceEbola virus (EBOV) is the causative agent of ongoing outbreaks of severe haemorrhagic fever with case-fatality rates between 40 and 60%. Proteins of many viruses with cytoplasmic replication cycles similar to EBOV interact with the nuclear trafficking machinery, resulting in active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling important to immune evasion and other intranuclear functions. However, exploitation of host trafficking machinery for nucleocytoplasmic transport by EBOV has not been directly examined. We find that the EBOV protein VP24 is actively trafficked between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and identify the specific pathways and sequences involved. The data indicate that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking is important for the multifunctional nature of VP24, which has critical roles in immune evasion and viral replication, identifying a new mechanism in infection by this highly lethal pathogen, and potential target for antivirals.",

    "abstract": "The capsid of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) plays a pivotal role in viral nuclear import, but the mechanism by which the viral core passages the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is poorly understood. Here, we use DNA-origami mimics of the NPC, termed NuPODs (NucleoPorins Organized by DNA), to reveal the mechanistic underpinnings of HIV-1 capsid nuclear entry. We found that trimeric interface formed via three capsid protein hexamers is targeted by a triple-arginine (RRR) motif but not the canonical phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif of NUP153. As NUP153 is located on the nuclear face of the NPC, this result implies that the assembled capsid must cross the NPC in vivo. This hypothesis is corroborated by our observations of tubular capsid assemblies penetrating through NUP153 NuPODs. NUP153 prefers to bind highly curved capsid assemblies including those found at the tips of viral cores, thereby facilitating capsid insertion into the NPC. Furthermore, a balance of capsid stabilization by NUP153 and deformation by CPSF6, along with other cellular factors, may allow for the intact capsid to pass NPCs of various sizes. The NuPOD system serves as a unique tool for unraveling the previously elusive mechanisms of nuclear import of HIV-1 and other viruses.",

Here we present the X-ray crystal structure of TMEV 2A and define how it recognises the stimulatory RNA element. We demonstrate a critical role for bases upstream of the originally predicted stem-loop, providing evidence for a pseudoknot-like conformation and suggesting that the recognition of this pseudoknot by beta-shell proteins is a conserved feature in cardioviruses. Through examination of PRF in TMEV-infected cells by ribosome profiling, we identify a series of ribosomal pauses around the site of PRF induced by the 2A-pseudoknot complex. Careful normalisation of ribosomal profiling data with a 2A knockout virus facilitated the identification, through disome analysis, of ribosome stacking at the TMEV frameshifting signal. These experiments provide unparalleled detail of the molecular mechanisms underpinning Theilovirus protein-stimulated frameshifting.",

Here we present the X-ray crystal structure of 2A and show that it selectively binds to and stabilises the PRF stimulatory RNA element in the viral genome. Using optical tweezers, we define the conformational repertoire of this element and measure changes in unfolding pathways arising from mutation and 2A binding. Next, we demonstrate a strong interaction between 2A and the small ribosomal subunit and present a cryo-EM structure of 2A bound to initiated 70S ribosomes. Multiple copies of 2A bind to the 16S rRNA where they may compete for binding with initiation and elongation factors. Together, these results define the structural basis for RNA recognition by 2A, expand our understanding of the 2A-dependent gene expression switch and reveal how 2A accumulation may shut down translation during virus infection.",

    "abstract": "The RAD51 recombinase plays critical roles in safeguarding genome integrity, which is fundamentally important for all living cells. While interphase functions of RAD51 in repairing broken DNA and protecting stalled replication forks are well characterised, its role in mitosis remains contentious. In this study, we show that RAD51 protects under-replicated DNA in mitotic human cells and, in this way, promotes mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS) and successful chromosome segregation. MiDAS was globally detectable irrespective of DNA damage and was promoted by de novo RAD51 recruitment, RAD51-mediated fork protection, and RAD51 phosphorylation by the key mitotic regulator Polo-like kinase 1. Importantly, acute inhibition of RAD51-promoted MiDAS led to mitotic DNA damage, delayed anaphase onset and induced centromere fragility, revealing a mechanism that prevents the satisfaction of the spindle assembly checkpoint when chromosomal replication remains incomplete. This study hence identifies an unexpected function of RAD51 in promoting the stability of mitotic chromatin.",

    "abstract": "The basal transcription factors of cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs) stimulate the initial RNA synthesis via poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we explored the mechanism employed by the bacterial factor {sigma} in promoter-independent initial transcription. We found that the RNAP holoenzyme lacking the promoter-binding domain {sigma}4 is ineffective in de novo transcription initiation and displays high propensity to pausing upon extension of RNAs 3 to 7 nucleotides in length. The {sigma}4 domain stabilizes short RNA:DNA hybrids and suppresses pausing by stimulating RNAP active-center translocation. The anti-pausing activity of {sigma}4 is modulated by its interaction with the {beta} subunit flap domain and by the {sigma} remodeling factors AsiA and RbpA. Our results suggest that the presence of {sigma}4 within the RNA exit channel compensates for the intrinsic instability of short RNA:DNA hybrids by increasing RNAP processivity, thus favoring productive transcription initiation. This \"RNAP boosting\" activity of the initiation factor is shaped by the the thermodynamics of RNA:DNA interactions and thus, should be relevant for any factor-dependent RNAP.",

    "abstract": "XRN1 is a highly conserved exoribonuclease which degrades uncapped RNAs in a 5-3 direction. Degradation of RNAs by XRN1 is important in many cellular and developmental processes and is relevant to human disease. Studies in D. melanogaster demonstrate that XRN1 can target specific RNAs, which have important consequences for developmental pathways. Osteosarcoma is a malignancy of the bone and accounts for 2% of all paediatric cancers worldwide. 5 year survival of patients has remained static since the 1970s and therefore furthering our molecular understanding of this disease is crucial. Previous work has shown a downregulation of XRN1 in osteosarcoma cells, however the transcripts regulated by XRN1 which might promote osteosarcoma remain elusive. Here, we confirm reduced levels of XRN1 in osteosarcoma cell lines and patient samples and identify XRN1-sensitive transcripts in human osteosarcoma cells. Using RNA-seq in XRN1-knockdown SAOS-2 cells, we show that 1178 genes are differentially regulated. Using a novel bioinformatic approach, we demonstrate that 134 transcripts show characteristics of direct post-transcriptional regulation by XRN1. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are enriched in this group suggesting that XRN1 normally plays an important role in controlling lncRNA expression in these cells. Among potential lncRNAs targeted by XRN1 is HOTAIR, which is known to be upregulated in osteosarcoma and contribute to disease progression. We have also identified G-rich and GU motifs in post-transcriptionally regulated transcripts which appear to sensitise them to XRN1 degradation. Our results therefore provide significant insights into the specificity of XRN1 in human cells which is relevant to disease.",
