    "abstract": "Major effectors of adult-stage fetal globin silencing include the transcription factors (TFs) BCL11A and ZBTB7A/LRF and the NuRD chromatin complex, although each has potential on-target liabilities for rational {beta}-hemoglobinopathy therapeutic inhibition. Here through CRISPR screening we discover ZNF410 to be a novel fetal hemoglobin (HbF) repressing TF. ZNF410 does not bind directly to the{gamma} -globin genes but rather its chromatin occupancy is solely concentrated at CHD4, encoding the NuRD nucleosome remodeler, itself required for HbF repression. CHD4 has two ZNF410-bound regulatory elements with 27 combined ZNF410 binding motifs constituting unparalleled genomic clusters. These elements completely account for ZNF410s effects on{gamma} -globin repression. Knockout of ZNF410 reduces CHD4 by 60%, enough to substantially de-repress HbF while avoiding the cellular toxicity of complete CHD4 loss. Mice with constitutive deficiency of the homolog Zfp410 are born at expected Mendelian ratios with unremarkable hematology. ZNF410 is dispensable for human hematopoietic engraftment potential and erythroid maturation unlike known HbF repressors. These studies identify a new rational target for HbF induction for the {beta}-hemoglobin disorders with a wide therapeutic index. More broadly, ZNF410 represents a special class of gene regulator, a conserved transcription factor with singular devotion to regulation of a chromatin subcomplex.",

    "abstract": "Generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) is an important process in triggering cellular necrosis and tissue infarction during ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. Ischemia results in accumulation of the metabolite succinate. Rapid oxidation of this succinate by mitochondrial complex II (Cx-II) during reperfusion reduces the co-enzyme Q (Co-Q) pool, thereby driving electrons backward into complex-I (Cx-I), a process known as reverse electron transport (RET), which is thought to be a major source of ROS. During ischemia, enhanced glycolysis results in an acidic cellular pH at the onset of reperfusion. While the process of RET within Cx-I is known to be enhanced by a high mitochondrial trans-membrane {Delta}pH, the impact of pH itself on the integrated process of Cx-II to Cx-I RET has not been fully studied. Using isolated mitochondria under conditions which mimic the onset of reperfusion (i.e., high [ADP]). We show that mitochondrial respiration (state 2 and state 3) as well as isolated Cx-II activity are impaired at acidic pH, whereas the overall generation of ROS by Cx-II to Cx-I RET was insensitive to pH. Together these data indicate that the acceleration of Cx-I RET ROS by {Delta}pH appears to be cancelled out by the impact of pH on the source of electrons, i.e. Cx-II. Implications for the role of Cx-II to Cx-I RET derived ROS in IR injury are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Mediated microbial electrosynthesis (MES) represents a promising strategy for the capture and conversion of CO2 into carbon-based products. We describe the development and application of a comprehensive multiphysics model to analyze a formate-mediated MES reactor. The model shows that this system can achieve a biomass productivity of [~]1.7 g L-1 hr-1 but is limited by a competitive trade-off between O2 gas/liquid mass transfer and CO2 transport to the cathode. Synthetic metabolic strategies are evaluated for formatotrophic growth, which can enable an energy efficiency of [~]21%, a 30% improvement over the Calvin cycle. However, carbon utilization efficiency is only [~]10% in the best cases due to a futile CO2 cycle, so gas recycle will be necessary for greater efficiency. Finally, separating electrochemical and microbial processes into separate reactors enables a higher biomass productivity of [~]2.4 g L-1 hr-1. The mediated MES model and analysis presented here can guide process design for conversion of CO2 into renewable chemical feedstocks.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundToxoplasmosis is caused by the parasite Toxoplasma gondii that can infect the central nervous system (CNS), promoting neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, neurotransmitter imbalance and behavioral alterations. T. gondii infection is also related to neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. The pathogenicity and inflammatory response in rodents are different to the case of humans, compromising the correlation between the behavioral alterations and physiological modifications observed in the disease. In the present work we used BrainSpheres, a 3D CNS model derived from human pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), to investigate the morphological and biochemical repercussions of T. gondii infection in human neural cells.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated T. gondii ME49 strain proliferation and cyst formation in both 2D cultured human neural cells and BrainSpheres. Aspects of cell morphology, ultrastructure, viability, gene expression of neural phenotype markers, as well as secretion of inflammatory mediators were evaluated for 2 and 4 weeks post infection in BrainSpheres.\n\nResultsT. gondii can infect BrainSpheres, proliferating and inducing cysts formation, neural cell death, alteration in neural gene expression and triggering the release of several inflammatory mediator.\n\nConclusionsBrainSpheres reproduce many aspects of T. gondii infection in human CNS, constituting a useful model to study the neurotoxicity and neuroinflammation mediated by the parasite. In addition, BrainSpheres can be an important tool for better understanding the possible correlation between psychiatric disorders and human CNS infection with T. gondii",

    "abstract": "Severe stress exposure causes the loss of dendritic spines on cortical pyramidal neurons and induces psychiatric-like symptoms in rodent models. These effects are strongest following early-life stress and are most persistent on apical dendrites. However, the long-term impacts and temporal effects of stress exposure on the human brain remain poorly understood. Using a novel postmortem cohort of psychiatric cases with severe stress experienced in childhood, adulthood, or no severe stress, and matched controls, we aimed to determine the impact of stress timing on pyramidal neuron structure in the human orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). We performed Golgi Cox staining and manually measured the morphology and density of over 22,000 dendritic spines on layer-specific pyramidal neuron apical dendrites. We also quantified glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein as a marker of stress dysregulation. Both childhood and adulthood stress were associated with large reductions in mature mushroom spine density (up to 56% loss) in both the superficial (II/III) and deeper layers (V) of the OFC. However, childhood stress caused more substantial reductions to both total and mature mushroom spines. No difference in glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein were seen between groups, although both negatively correlated with total spine density within the whole cohort. These findings indicate that severe stress, especially when experienced during childhood, persistently affects the fine morphological properties of neurons in the human OFC. This may impact on cell connectivity in this brain area, and at least partly explain the social and emotional symptoms that originate in the OFC in psychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Inborn errors of human IFN-{gamma} immunity underlie mycobacterial disease. We report a patient with mycobacterial disease due to an inherited deficiency of the transcription factor T-bet. This deficiency abolishes the expression of T-bet target genes, including IFNG, by altering chromatin accessibility and DNA methylation in CD4+ T cells. The patient has profoundly diminished counts of mycobacterial-reactive circulating NK, invariant NKT (iNKT), mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT), and V{delta}2+ {gamma}{delta} T lymphocytes, and of non-mycobacterial-reactive classic TH1 lymphocytes, the remainders of which also produce abnormally low amounts of IFN-{gamma}. Other IFN-{gamma}-producing lymphocyte subsets however develop normally, but with low levels of IFN-{gamma} production, with exception of V{delta}2- {gamma}{delta} T lymphocytes, which produce normal amounts of IFN-{gamma} in response to non-mycobacterial stimulation, and non-classic TH1 (TH1*) lymphocytes, which produce IFN-{gamma} normally in response to mycobacterial antigens. Human T-bet deficiency thus underlies mycobacterial disease by preventing the development of, and IFN-{gamma} production by, innate (NK) and innate-like adaptive lymphocytes (iNKT, MAIT, and V{delta}2+ {gamma}{delta} T cells), with mycobacterial-specific, IFN-{gamma}-producing, purely adaptive {beta} TH1* cells unable to compensate for this deficit.",

    "abstract": "Activation of CD4T cells by conventional dendritic cells (cDC) is pivotal in adaptive immunity. However, while the activation mechanism of antigen-specific CD4T cells has been extensively studied, the cellular mechanism that leads to the selection of cognate CD4T cell clones out of the polyclonal pool is incompletely understood. Here, we show that, in the reactive lymph nodes, newly homed naive polyclonal CD4T cells are temporarily retained before leaving the lymph node. This stop-and-go traffic of CD4T cells provides an adequate time window for efficient scanning and timely priming of antigen-specific clones. Mechanistically, upon immunization, CD301b+ DCs, a major subset of migratory cDC2 cells, quickly migrate to the draining lymph node and settle in the areas near the high endothelial venules, where they retain incoming polyclonal CD4T cells through MHCII-dependent but antigen-independent mechanisms while concurrently providing cognate stimuli to prime antigen-specific CD4T cells. These results indicate that CD301b+ DCs function as an immunological \"display window\" for CD4T cells to efficiently scan their antigen specificity.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/276410v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@118d9b7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7daf2eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17808c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@186780e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LINewly homed polyclonal CD4T cells are temporarily retained in the reactive lymph nodes.\nC_LIO_LIDepletion of CD301b+ DCs results in shorter dwell time of CD4T cells in the draining lymph node and delayed priming of antigen-specific clones.\nC_LIO_LIThe transient retention of polyclonal CD4T cells in the draining lymph node requires MHCII expression on CD301b+ DCs but not cognate antigen.\nC_LIO_LICD301b+ DCs are required for robust expansion of rare antigen-specific CD4T cell clones and their skewing toward Th2 cells.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Euphausiids (or krill) are important contributors to marine biomass and key players in marine pelagic trophic webs. Euphausiids stomachs represent a specific niche for microbes that participate in the digestion of the host dietary components. To date, methods for the study of the diversity and function of these microorganisms remain complex. Often, bacterial ribosomal sequences obtained from lysates of stomachs are overrepresented by organisms from the surrounding environment. Flow cytometry with cell sorting (FC-CS) have become a powerful technique to study microbial community structure but also for the study of population genomics of gut-associated bacteria, even at a single-cell level.\n\nIn this study, we used FC-CS and sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene to study the microorganisms inhabiting the stomach of the Humboldt Current krill, Euphausia mucronata. This approach was complemented with DNA extraction and sequencing from whole lysate stomachs as described for other crustacean species.\n\nNon-specific amplification was not retrieved in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from cells sorted, opposite to the observed using the DNA from the whole lysate. Sequences obtained from the whole stomach DNA were enriched in picocyanobacteria, meanwhile, sequences retrieved from cells sorted belonged almost exclusively to Balneola sp. of the new phylum, Balneolaeota. This study represents, to our knowledge, the first report of Balneola sp. in the stomach for any organism inhabiting the Humboldt Current System (HCS).\n\nOur results suggest that the stomach-associated microbiota can be characterized by FC-CS and sequencing by manual scraping of the stomach coupled with the DNA extraction and sequencing. This work represents a baseline for similar studies of other mesozooplankton groups. The implementation of this technique might complement future studies on host-microbes interaction and their implications on the marine pelagic food web.",

    "abstract": "Cell penetrating peptides (CPP) are increasingly used for cellular drug delivery in both pro- and eukaryotic cells, and oligoarginines have attracted special attention. However; their mechanism of action, particularly for prokaryotes is still unknown. Arginine-rich CPPs (R-CPP) efficiently delivers the antimicrobial peptide nucleic acid (PNA) into bacteria. Here, we show that resistance to an R-CPP PNA conjugate in Escherichia coli requires multiple genetic modifications and is specific to R-CPP and not to the PNA-part. An integral part of the resistance was the constitutively activated Cpx-envelope stress response system (cpx*), which decreased the cytoplasmic membrane potential and thereby indicates an indirectly energy dependent uptake mechanism. Interestingly, cpx* mutants also showed increased tolerance to aminoglycosides and R-CPP conjugated to a peptide targeting the DNA sliding clamp; i.e., similar uptake in E. coli for these antimicrobial compounds. We speculate that the cpx* phenotype could create an evolutionary opportunity to adapt and evolve in the presence of either compounds.\n\nAuthor summaryThe emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria is raising the need for new classes of antibiotics. Peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) may fill this requirement by their ability to block translation of essential mRNAs and hence inhibit growth. PNA needs conjugation to a delivery peptide (cell penetrating peptide; CPP) to enter the bacteria. Arginine-rich CPPs (CPPR) are receiving a lot of attention for use as delivery vessels. Here, we show, for the first time, CPPR-PNA resistance in Escherichia coli directed towards the delivery peptide. Consequently, resistance also applies to other antimicrobial compounds delivered by the same carrier. An integral part of CPPR resistance is due to a constitutive active Cpx-response system, which leads to a decreased electric potential ({Delta}{Psi}) across the inner membrane. The decreased {Delta}{Psi} is a result of down-regulation of two aerobic respiratory operons, namely NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase complex I and cytochrome bo3 ubiquinol oxidase. The decreased {Delta}{Psi} also led to increased tolerance to aminoglycosides. This shows that a (large) negative {Delta}{Psi} is important for providing sufficient free energy for membrane translocation of both CPPR and that the inner membrane is the main barrier for entry of both arginine-rich delivery peptides and aminoglycosides.",

    "abstract": "Usutu virus (USUV; Flavivirus), a close phylogenetic and ecological relative of West Nile virus, is a zoonotic virus that can cause neuroinvasive disease in humans. USUV is maintained in an enzootic cycle between Culex mosquitoes and birds. Since the first isolation in 1959 in South Africa, USUV has spread throughout Africa and Europe. Reported human cases have increased over the last few decades, primarily in Europe, with symptoms ranging from mild febrile illness to severe neurological effects. In this study, we investigated whether USUV has become more pathogenic during emergence in Europe. Interferon /{beta} receptor knockout (Ifnar1-/-) mice were inoculated with recent USUV isolates from Africa and Europe, as well as the historic 1959 South African strain. The three tested African strains and one European strain from Spain caused 100% mortality in inoculated mice, with similar survival times and histopathology in tissues. Unexpectedly, a European strain from the Netherlands caused only 12% mortality and significantly less histopathology in tissues from mice compared to mice inoculated with the other strains. Viremia was highest in mice inoculated with the recent African strains and lowest in mice inoculated with the Netherlands strain. Based on phylogenetics, the USUV isolates from Spain and the Netherlands were derived from separate introductions into Europe, suggesting that disease outcomes may differ for USUV strains circulating in Europe. These results also suggest that while more human USUV disease cases have been reported in Europe recently, circulating African USUV strains are still a potential major health concern.\n\nAuthor SummaryUsutu virus (USUV) is an emerging mosquito-borne virus that causes severe neuroinvasive disease in humans. USUV was first detected in Africa in 1959, and cases of human disease have increased in recent years. Most USUV disease cases are now reported in Europe, where the virus currently circulating. One possibility for the increase in case numbers is that USUV strains have become more pathogenic over time during its spread from Africa into Europe. We compared the pathogenesis of five USUV isolates from Africa and Europe in a mouse model. Three isolates from Africa and one isolate from Europe caused 100% mortality in mice. Surprisingly, one isolate from Netherlands caused only 12% motality. Significantly less histopathology was observed in tissues from mice inoculated with the Netherlands strain compared to mice inoculated with the other four strains. Our results suggest that, even though more human USUV disease cases have been reported in Europe recently, African USUV strains are also highly pathogenic.",

Here we report the in vivo transcriptome of the entomopathogenic bacterium Yersinia entomophaga MH96, captured during three stages of intrahemocoelic infection in Galleria mellonella. A total of 1,285 genes were significantly upregulated by MH96 during infection; 829 genes responded to in vivo conditions during at least one stage of infection, 289 responded during two stages of infection and 167 transcripts responded throughout all three stages of infection. Genes upregulated during the earliest infection stage included components of the insecticidal toxin complex Yen-TC (chi1, chi2 and yenC1), genes for rearrangement hotspot element containing protein yenC3, cytolethal distending toxin cdtAB and vegetative insecticidal toxin vip2. Genes more highly expressed throughout the infection cycle included the putative heat-stable enterotoxin yenT and three adhesins (usher-chaperone fimbria, filamentous hemagglutinin and an AidA-like secreted adhesin). Clustering and functional enrichment of gene expression data also revealed expression of genes encoding type III and VI secretion system-associated effectors. Together these data provide insight into the pathobiology of MH96 and serve as an important resource supporting efforts to identify novel insecticidal agents.",

    "abstract": "During infection, Toxoplasma gondii translocates effector proteins directly into its host cell to subvert various signaling pathways. Here we characterize a novel secreted effector that localizes to the host cell nucleus where it modulates NCoR/SMRT repressor complex levels to repress interferon regulated genes involved in cell death. Type I and type II interferons upregulate many genes including protein kinase R (PKR), inducing formation of the necrosome complex that activates Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain Like Pseudokinase (MLKL) to execute necrotic cell death. Toxoplasma NCoR/SMRT modulator (TgNSM) acts together with another secreted effector TgIST, previously shown to down-modulate IFN-{gamma} signaling to block immune functions. Together TgNSM and TgIST block IFN driven expression of PKR and MLKL, thus preventing host cell necroptotic death. The mechanism of action of TgNSM highlights a previously unappreciated role of NCoR/SMRT in regulation of necroptosis, assuring survival of intracellular cysts, and maintenance of chronic infection.",

    "abstract": "FAM132b, also known as myonectin, has been identified as a myokine produced by exercise. It is a secreted protein precursor that belongs to the adipolin/erythroferrone family, and has hormone activity in circulation to regulate cellular iron homeostasis and lipid metabolism via unknown receptors. Here, adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV9) were engineered to induce overexpression of FAM132b with 2 codon mutations (A136T and P159A). Treatment of mice under high-fat diet feeding with FAM132b gene transfer resulted in marked reductions in body weight, fat depot, adipocytes size, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Moreover, FAM132b overproduction reduced glycemic response to epinephrine (EPI) in whole body and increased lipolytic response to EPI in adipose tissues. This adrenergic response of adipose tissue led to the result that gene transfer reduced glycogen utilization and increased fat consumption in skeletal muscle during exercise. FAM132b knockdown by shRNA significantly increased glycemic response to EPI in vivo and reduced adipocytes response to EPI and adipose tissue browning. Structural analysis suggested that FAM132b mutants delivered by AAV9 may form a weak bond with ADRB2, and potentially bind to insulin against insulin receptor by blocking the receptor binding sites on insulin B-chain. Our study underscores the potential of FAM132b gene therapy with codon optimization to treat obesity by modulating adrenergic response and interfering insulin action.\n\nSignificanceWe show here that AAV9-mediated expression of FAM132b with A136T and P159A is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for improving glucose homeostasis. This is the first demonstration of a therapeutic effect on metabolic disorders in mice with FAM132b codon optimization. These therapeutic effects indicate that FAM132b gene transfer with selective codon mutants in vivo might be a valid therapy for diabetes that can be extended to other metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWGTPases are molecular switches that regulate a wide range of cellular processes, such as organelle biogenesis, position, shape, and function, vesicular transport between organelles, and signal transduction. These hydrolase enzymes operate by toggling between an active \"ON\") guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state and an inactive (\"OFF\") guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound state; such a toggle is regulated by GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange factors) and GAPs (GTPase activating proteins). Here we propose a model for a network motif between monomeric (m) and trimeric (t) GTPases assembled exclusively in eukaryotic cells of multicellular organisms. We develop a system of ordinary differential equations in which these two classes of GT-Pases are interlinked conditional to their ON/OFF states within a motif through coupling and feedback loops. We provide explicit formulae for the steady states of the system and perform classical local stability analysis to systematically investigate the role of the different connections between the GTPase switches. Interestingly, a coupling of the active mGTPase to the GEF of the tGTPase was sufficient to provide two locally stable states: one where both active/inactive forms of the mGTPase can be interpreted as having low concentrations and the other where both m- and tGTPase have high concentrations. Moreover, when a feedback loop from the GEF of the tGTPase to the GAP of the mGTPase was added to the coupled system, two other locally stable states emerged, both having the tGTPase inactivated and being interpreted as having low active tGTPase concentrations. Finally, the addition of a second feedback loop, from the active tGT-Pase to the GAP of the mGTPase, gives rise to a family of steady states that can be parametrized by a range of inactive tGTPase concentrations. Our findings reveal that the coupling of these two different GTPase motifs can dramatically change their steady state behaviors and shed light on how such coupling may impact signaling mechanisms in eukaryotic cells.",

Even though the genetic heterogeneity among these cell types are documented, unidentified cell populations arising from the olfactory placode remain. One candidate to identify placodal derived neurons in the developing nasal area is the transcription factor Isl1, which was recently identified in GnRH-3 neurons of the terminal nerve in fish, as well as expression in neurons of the nasal migratory mass. Here, we analyzed the Isl1 genetic lineage in chemosensory neuronal populations in the nasal area and migratory GnRH-1 neurons in mice using in-situ hybridization, immunolabeling a Tamoxifen inducible Isl1CreERT and a constitutive Isl1Cre knock-in mouse lines. In addition, we also performed conditional Isl1 ablation in developing GnRH neurons. We found Isl1 lineage across non sensory cells of the respiratory epithelium and sustentacular cells of OE and VNO. We identified a population of transient embryonic Isl1+ neurons in the olfactory epithelium and sparse Isl1+ neurons in postnatal VNO. Isl1 is expressed in almost all GnRH neurons and in approximately half of the other neuron populations in the Migratory Mass. However, Isl1 conditional ablation alone does not significantly compromise GnRH-1 neuronal migration or GnRH-1 expression, suggesting compensatory mechanisms. Further studies will elucidate the functional and mechanistic role of Isl1 in development of migratory endocrine neurons.",

However, the identification of individual, causal regulatory variants is challenging. Here, we used a massively parallel reporter assay to measure the cis-regulatory consequences of 5,832 natural DNA variants in the promoters of 2,503 genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified 451 causal variants, which underlie genetic loci known to affect gene expression. Several promoters harbored multiple causal variants. In five promoters, pairs of variants showed non-additive, epistatic interactions. Causal variants were enriched at conserved nucleotides, tended to have low derived allele frequency, and were depleted from promoters of essential genes, which is consistent with the action of negative selection. Causal variants were also enriched for alterations in transcription factor binding sites. Models integrating these features provided modest, but statistically significant, ability to predict causal variants.

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is a potentially lethal opportunistic pathogen that infects over [~]200,000 people and causes [~]100,000 deaths per year globally. Treating A. fumigatus infections is particularly challenging because of the recent emergence of azole-resistance. The majority of studies focusing on the molecular mechanisms underlying azole resistance have examined azole-resistant isolates. However, isolates that are susceptible to azoles also display variation in their sensitivity, presenting a unique opportunity to identify genes contributing to azole sensitivity. Here, we used genome-wide association (GWA) analysis to identify loci involved in azole sensitivity by analyzing the association between 68,853 SNPs and itraconazole (ITCZ) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in 76 clinical isolates of A. fumigatus from Japan. Population structure analysis suggests the presence of four distinct populations, with ITCZ MICs distributed relatively evenly across populations. We independently conducted GWA when treating ITCZ MIC as a quantitative trait and a binary trait and identified two SNPs with strong associations that were identified in both analyses. These SNPs fell within the coding regions of Afu2g02220 and Afu2g02140. We functionally validated Afu2g02220 by knocking it out using a CRISPR/Cas-9 approach, because orthologs of this gene are involved in sterol modification and ITCZ targets the ergosterol pathway. Knockout strains displayed no difference in growth compared to the parent strain in minimal media, yet a minor but consistent inhibition of growth in the presence of 0.15 ug/ml ITCZ. Our results suggest that GWA paired with efficient gene deletion is a powerful and unbiased strategy for identifying the genetic basis of complex traits in A. fumigatus.\n\nImportanceAspergillus fumigatus is a pathogenic mold that can infect and kill individuals with compromised immune systems. The azole class of drugs provide antifungal activity against A. fumigatus infections and have become an essential treatment strategy. Unfortunately, A. fumigatus azole resistance has recently emerged and rapidly risen in frequency making treatment more challenging. Our understanding of the molecular basis of azole sensitivity has been shaped mainly through candidate gene studies. Unbiased approaches are necessary to understand the full repertoire of genes and genetic variants underlying azole resistance and sensitivity. Here, we provide the first application of genome-wide association analysis in A. fumigatus in the identification of a gene (Afu2g02220) that contributes to itraconazole susceptibility. Our approach, which combines association mapping and CRISPR/Cas-9 for functional validation of candidate genes, has broad application for investigating the genetic basis of complex traits in fungal systems.",

    "abstract": "Despite saturated genetic profiling of breast cancers, oncogenic drivers for the clinically challenging basal-like breast cancer (BLBC) subtype are still poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that CIP2A is selectively essential for DNA damage-induced initiation of mouse BLBC tumors, but not of other cancer types. Mechanistically, CIP2A was discovered genome-widely the closest functional homologue for DNA-damage proteins TopBP1, RHNO, POLQ, NBN and PARP1. CIP2A directly interacts with the ATR-activation domain of TopBP1, and dampens both, chromatin binding of TopBP1 and RAD51, and G2/M checkpoint in DNA-damaged cells. CIP2A also drives BLBC-associated proliferative MYC and E2F1 signaling. Consistently with high DNA-damage response activity BLBCs, and CIP2As novel role in checkpoint signaling, CIP2A was found essential for DNA-damaged, and BRCA-mutant BLBC cells. Selective role for CIP2A as BLBC driver was supported by association of high CIP2A expression with poor patient prognosis only in BLBC, but not in other breast cancer types. Therapeutically, small molecule reactivators of PP2A (SMAPs) phenocopy CIP2A-dependent DNA damage response, and inhibit in vivo growth of patient-derived BLBC xenograft. In summary, we discover sub-type selective essential role for CIP2A in BLBC initiation and maintenance that can be explained by its newly discovered association with DNA-damage response, coordinated with regulation of proliferative signaling. The results also identify therapeutic strategy for CIP2A-dependent BLBCs.",

    "abstract": "Gene duplication is a source of evolutionary novelty. DNA methylation may play a role in the evolution of duplicate genes through its association with gene expression. While this relationship is examined to varying extent in a few individual species, the generalizability of these results at either a broad phylogenetic scale with species of differing duplication histories or across a population, remains unknown. We apply a comparative epigenomics approach to 43 angiosperm species across the phylogeny and a population of 928 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, examining the association of DNA methylation with paralog evolution. Genic DNA methylation is differentially associated with duplication type, the age of duplication, sequence evolution, and gene expression. Whole genome duplicates are typically enriched for CG-only gene-body methylated or unmethylated genes, while single-gene duplications are typically enriched for non-CG methylated or unmethylated genes. Non-CG methylation, in particular, was characteristic of more recent single-gene duplicates. Core angiosperm gene families are differentiated into those which preferentially retain paralogs and  duplication-resistant families, which convergently revert to singletons following duplication. Duplication-resistant families which still have paralogous copies are, uncharacteristically for core angiosperm genes, enriched for non-CG methylation. Non-CG methylated paralogs have higher rates of sequence evolution, higher frequency of presence-absence variation, and more limited expression. This suggests that silencing by non-CG methylation may be important to maintaining dosage following duplication and be a precursor to fractionation. Our results indicate that genic methylation marks differing evolutionary trajectories and fates between paralogous genes and have a role in maintaining dosage following duplication.",

    "abstract": "The seeds of land plants contain three genetically distinct structures: the embryo, endosperm, and seed coat. The embryo and endosperm need to interact and exchange signals to ensure coordinated growth. Accumulating evidence has confirmed that embryo growth is supported by the nourishing endosperm and regulated by signals originating from the endosperm. Available data also support that endosperm development requires communication with the embryo. Here, using single-fertilization mutants, Arabidopsis dmp8/9 and gex2, we demonstrate that in the absence of a zygote and embryo, endosperm initiation, syncytium formation, free nuclear cellularization, and endosperm degeneration are as normal as in the wild type in terms of the cytological process and time course. Although rapid embryo expansion accelerates endosperm breakdown, our findings strongly suggest that endosperm development is an autonomously organized process, independent of egg cell fertilization and embryo-endosperm communication. This work confirms both the altruistic and self-directed nature of the endosperm during coordinated embryo-endosperm development. The findings provide novel insights into the intricate interaction between the two fertilization products and will help to distinguish the real roles of the signaling between endosperm and embryo. These finding also shed new light on agro-biotechnology for crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor cortex controls movement in part through direct projections to the spinal cord. Here we show that these corticospinal neurons (CSNs) possess axon collaterals that innervate many supraspinal brain regions critical for motor control, most prominently the main input to the basal ganglia, the striatum. Corticospinal neurons that innervate the striatum form more synapses on D1-than D2-striatal projection neurons (SPNs). This biased innervation strategy corresponds to functionally distinct patterns of termination in spinal cord. CSNs are strongly driven during a striatum-dependent sequential forelimb behavior, and often represent high level movement features that are not linearly related to kinematic output.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAlzheimers disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, robust microgliosis, neuroinflammation, and neuronal loss. Genome-wide association studies recently highlighted a prominent role for microglia in late-onset AD (LOAD). Specifically, inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (INPP5D), also known as SHIP1, is selectively expressed in brain microglia and has been reported to be associated with LOAD. Although INPP5D is likely a crucial player in AD pathophysiology, its role in disease onset and progression remains unclear.\n\nMethodsWe performed differential gene expression analysis to investigate INPP5D expression in LOAD and its association with plaque density and microglial markers using transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) data from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership for Alzheimers Disease (AMP-AD) cohort. We also performed quantitative real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence assays to assess INPP5D expression in the 5xFAD amyloid mouse model.\n\nResultsDifferential gene expression analysis found that INPP5D expression was upregulated in LOAD and positively correlated with amyloid plaque density. In addition, in 5xFAD mice, Inpp5d expression increased as the disease progressed, and selectively in plaque-associated microglia. Increased Inpp5d expression levels in 5xFAD mice were abolished entirely by depleting microglia with the colony-stimulating factor receptor-1 antagonist PLX5622.\n\nConclusionsOur findings show that INPP5D expression increases as AD progresses, predominantly in plaque-associated microglia. Importantly, we provide the first evidence that increased INPP5D expression might be a risk factor in AD, highlighting INPP5D as a potential therapeutic target. Moreover, we have shown that the 5xFAD mouse model is appropriate for studying INPP5D in AD.",

    "abstract": "Microbial preference for elevated hydrostatic pressure (HP) is a recognized key feature of environmental and industrial processes. HP effects on macromolecules and, consequently, cell functionality has been accurately described in the last decades. While there is little debate about the importance of HP in shaping microbial life, a systematic definition of microbial preference for increased HP is missing. The lack of a consensus about  true piezophiles, and  low or  high HP levels, has deleterious repercussions on microbiology and biotechnology. As certain levels are considered  low they are not applied to assess microbial activity. Most microorganisms collected in deep waters or sediments have not been tested (nor isolated) using the corresponding HP at which they were captured. Microbial response to HP is notoriously dependent on other environmental parameters, most notably temperature, but also on availability of nutrients, growth substrate, pH and salinity. This implies that countless isolates retrieved from ambient pressure conditions may very well require increased HP to grow optimally, as already demonstrated in both Archaea and Bacteria.\n\nIn the present study, I collected the data from described piezophilic isolates and used the fundamental correlation existing between HP and temperature, as first suggested in seminal works by Yayanos, to update the definition of piezophiles. Thanks to the numerous new piezophilic isolates available since such seminal studies, the present analysis brings forward updated definitions which concern 1) the actual beginning of the piezosphere, the area in the deep sea where piezophiles thrive; 2) the HP thresholds which should be considered low, medium and high HP, and their implications for experimental design in Microbiology; and 3) the nature of obligate piezophiles and their location in the deep sea.",

    "abstract": "Cellular regeneration, which relies on extensive restructuring of cytoplasmic materials, is an essential process to restore tissues and organs lost during aging, degenerative diseases and injury. At early stages of Drosophila spermatogenesis, when cellular constituents are intensely remodeled, there are two different populations of stem cells, the somatic stem cells and the germline stem cells (GSCs). GSCs divide by asymmetric division to give rise two distinct daughter cells. One of them will leave the stem cells niche and differentiate into spermatogonial cells (SCs). Both aging and cellular stress can lead to the loss of GSCs. Lost GSCs can be restored by dedifferentiation of SCs into functional GSCs. In other tissues, macrophages provide specific conditions for cellular transformation. Here we examined the potential role of immune surveillance cells called hemocytes during dedifferentiation of SGs into GSCs. We found an elevated number of hemocytes during this dedifferentiation process. Immune depletion of hemocytes decreased the regeneration capacity of germline. We also show that autophagy, which plays a pivotal role in cellular differentiation by eliminating unwanted, superfluous parts of the cytoplasm, becomes upregulated in dedifferentiating SCs upon JAK-STAT signaling emitted by hemocytes. Furthermore, these immune cells regulate expression of Omi/HtrA2, a key regulator of apoptosis in early spermatogenesis. Together, we suggest that hemocytes have important functions in the dedifferentiation process of GSCs.",

    "abstract": "The second half of the Spring 2020 semester has been an unprecedented time globally due to the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19 pandemic has forced more than one billion students out of school, has disrupted the world and led all university courses switched to online instruction social distancing actions taken to limit the spread of the virus. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the pandemic related changes for undergraduate students, to assess their perspectives related to their learning, experiences in two courses, and to discuss the far-reaching potential implications for the upcoming summer and fall semesters. An electronic survey was conducted to gather data on the student perceptions and learning characteristics of this transition from face-to-face (F2F) to online at a medium-sized university in the Southeast in the Spring 2020 semester. Nearly 88% of the participants indicated that the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their education, while 19% indicated that they prefer online over F2F learning. Furthermore, the online modality significantly increased attendance in General Biology I. Our study also showed that the usage of live conferencing and digital applications increased due to the pandemic. The current research fills the gap in the existing literature by providing the first study on the effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on undergraduate learning and experiences in the most unique dual modality of the Spring 2020 semester.",

    "abstract": "1Gene regulation involves synergistic interactions between transcription factors (TFs). Classical thermodynamic models offer a biophysical understanding of synergy based on binding cooperativity and regulated recruitment of RNA polymerase. However, transcription requires polymerase to transition through multiple states. Accordingly, recent work has suggested that \"kinetic synergy\" can arise through TFs differentially regulating distinct steps of the transcription cycle. Disentangling both sources of synergy has been challenging. Here, we combine theory and experiment to analyze TFs binding to a single shared site, thereby removing simultaneous specific DNA binding. Using the graph-based linear framework, we integrate TF binding with regulation of the transcription cycle, and reveal a complex kinetic synergy landscape dependent on TF concentration, DNA binding and transcriptional activity. We exploit synthetic zinc-finger TF fusions to experimentally interrogate these predictions. Our results confirm that transcription cycle regulation must be integrated with recruitment for a quantitative understanding of transcriptional control.",

    "abstract": "The heat stress response activates the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), which subsequently upregulates heat shock proteins to maintain the integrity of the proteome. HSF1 activation requires nuclear localization, trimerization, DNA binding, phosphorylation, and gene transactivation. Phosphorylation at S326 is an important regulator of HSF1 transcriptional activity. Phosphorylation at S326 is mediated by AKT1, mTOR, p38, and MEK1. Here, we observe that AKT1 activates HSF1 independent of mTOR. AKT2 also phosphorylated S326 of HSF1 but showed weak ability to activate HSF1. Similarly, mTOR, p38, and MEK1 all phosphorylated S326 but AKT1 was the more potent activator. Mass spectrometry showed that AKT1 also phosphorylated HSF1 at T142, S230, and T527 in addition to S326 whereas the other kinases did not. Subsequent investigation revealed that phosphorylation at T142 is necessary for HSF1 trimerization and that S230, S326, and T527 are required for HSF1 gene transactivation and recruitment of TFIIB and CDK9. This study suggests that HSF1 hyperphosphorylation is targeted and these specific residues have direct function in regulating HSF1 transcriptional activity.",

    "abstract": "Large, comprehensive collections of scRNA-seq data sets have been generated that allow for the full transcriptional characterization of cell types across a wide variety of biological and clinical conditions. As new methods arise to measure distinct cellular modalities, a key analytical challenge is to integrate these data sets or transfer knowledge from one to the other to better understand cellular identity and functions. Here, we present a simple yet surprisingly effective method named cFIT for capturing various batch effects across experiments, technologies, subjects, and even species. The proposed method models the shared information between various data sets by a common factor space, while allowing for unique distortions and shifts in gene-wise expression in each batch. The model parameters are learned under an iterative non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) framework and then used for synchronized integration from across-domain assays. In addition, the model enables transferring via low-rank matrix from more informative data to allow for precise identification in data of lower quality. Compared to existing approaches, our method imposes weaker assumptions on the cell composition of each individual data set, however, is shown to be more reliable in preserving biological variations. We apply cFIT to multiple scRNA-seq data sets of developing brain from human and mouse, varying by technologies and developmental stages. The successful integration and transfer uncover the transcriptional resemblance across systems. The study helps establish a comprehensive landscape of brain cell type diversity and provides insights into brain development.",
