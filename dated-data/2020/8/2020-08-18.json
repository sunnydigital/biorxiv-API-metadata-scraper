However, no conclusive structural confirmation has been obtained. In this study cryo-electron tomography was used to reveal the supramolecular architecture of the rat heart mitochondria cristae. We show that rows of respiratory chain supercomplexes are connected with rows of ATP synthases forming the oligomeric hypercomplex. The discovered hypercomplexes may increase the effectiveness of oxidative phosphorylation ensuring a direct proton transfer from pumps to ATP synthase along the membrane without energy dissipation.",

After fertilization, the embryos were collected every 10 min up to 2 h, every 20 min up to 4 h, and every 30 min until hatching. The fertilized eggs of M. oligolepis measured approximately 0.85 {+/-} 0.5 mm and have an adhesive surface. The embryonic development lasted 14 hours at 25{degrees}C, with the Zygote, Cleavage, Blastula, Gastrula, Neurula and Segmentation phases. The hatching occurred in embryos around the 30-somites stage. Our results bring only the second description of embryonic development to a species of Moenkhausia genus, the first for the refereed species. Such data are of paramount importance considering the current conflicting state of this genus phylogenetic classification and may help taxonomic studies. Understand the biology of a species that is easily handling in captive conditions and has an ornamental appeal may assist studies in its reproduction in order to both, supply the aquarium market and help the species conservation in nature. Moreover, our data enable the M. oligolepis to be used as a model species in biotechnological applications, such germ cell transplantation approach.",

    "abstract": "Statistical learning by the human brain plays a core role in the development of cognitive systems like language and music. Both music and speech have structured inherent rhythms, however the acoustic sources of these rhythms are debated. Theoretically, rhythm structures in both systems may be related to a novel set of acoustic statistics embedded in the amplitude envelope, statistics originally revealed by modelling childrens nursery rhymes. Here we apply similar modelling to explore whether the amplitude modulation (AM) timescales underlying rhythm in music match those in child-directed speech (CDS). Utilising AM-driven phase hierarchy modelling previously applied to infant-directed speech (IDS), adult-directed speech (ADS) and CDS, we test whether the physical stimulus characteristics that yield speech rhythm in IDS and CDS describe rhythm in music. Two models were applied. One utilized a low-dimensional representation of the auditory signal adjusted for known mechanisms of the human cochlear, and the second utilized probabilistic amplitude demodulation, estimating the modulator (envelope) and carriers using Bayesian inference. Both models revealed a similar hierarchically-nested temporal modulation structure across Western musical genres and instruments. Core bands of AM and spectral patterning matched prior analyses of IDS and CDS, and music showed strong phase dependence between slower bands of AMs, again matching IDS and CDS. This phase dependence is critical to the perception of rhythm. Control analyses modelling other natural sounds (wind, rain, storms, rivers) did not show similar temporal modulation structures and phase dependencies. We conclude that acoustic rhythm in language and music has a shared statistical basis.",

    "abstract": "The human forebrain has expanded in size and complexity compared to that of chimpanzee despite limited changes in protein-coding genes, suggesting that gene regulation is an important driver of brain evolution. Here we identify a KRAB-ZFP transcription factor, ZNF558, that is expressed in human but not chimpanzee forebrain neural progenitor cells. ZNF558 evolved as a suppressor of LINE-1 transposons but has been co-opted to regulate the mitophagy gene SPATA18, supporting a link between mitochondrial homeostasis and cortical expansion. The unusual on-off switch for ZNF558 expression resides in a downstream variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) that is contracted in humans relative to chimpanzee. Our data reveal the brain-specific co-option of a transposon-controlling KRAB-ZFP and how a human-specific regulatory network is established by a cis-acting structural genome variation. This represents a previously undescribed genetic mechanism in the evolution of the human brain.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP), the most prevalent physical disability in children, has long been ignored with regard to its inherent molecular mechanism. In this work, we performed in-depth clinical and molecular analysis on 120 idiopathic CP families, and identified in half of the patients the underlying risk factors. By a compilation of 117 CP-related genes, we recognized the characteristic features in terms of inheritance and function, and proposed a dichotomous classification system according to the expression patterns. In two patients with both CP and intellectual disability, we revealed that the defective TYW1, a tRNA hypermodification enzyme, caused microcephaly and problems in motion and cognition by hindering neuronal proliferation and migration. We developed an algorithm and proved in mice brain that this malfunctioning hypermodification specifically perturbed the translation of a subset of proteins involved in cell cycling. In a CP patient with normal intelligence, we identified a mitochondrial enzyme GPAM, the hypomorphic form of which led to hypomyelination of corticospinal tract. We confirmed that the aberrant Gpam in mice perturbed the lipid metabolism in astrocyte, resulting in suppressed astrocyte proliferation and a shortage of lipid contents supplied for oligodendrocyte myelination. This work broadened the scope of understanding of CP etiology and paved a way for innovative therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Although genomic diversity is increasingly recognised as a key component of biodiversity, it is seldom used to inform conservation planning. Estuaries and keystone species such as the southern African seagrass, Zostera capensis, are under severe anthropogenic pressure and are often poorly protected. In this study we integrated SNP data generated from populations of Z. capensis across the South African coastline into the spatial prioritisation tool Marxan. We included different measures of genomic variation to account for genomic diversity, distinctness and evolutionary potential to explore spatial planning scenarios. We investigated how conservation priority areas identified by targeting only habitat type, differed from those identified by also including genomic measures; further we assessed how different genetic diversity metrics change prioritisation outcomes. All scenarios targeting genomic variation identified unique conservation prioritisation areas compared to scenarios only targeting habitat type. As such, omitting these estuaries from regional MPA networks risks the loss of evolutionarily important populations, threatening resilience and persistence of associated estuarine communities and their ecosystem services. We also observed a high degree of overlap between prioritisation outcomes across targeted measures of genomic variation. As such, by including even single measures of genomic variation, it may be possible to sufficiently represent the evolutionary processes behind the patterns of variation, while simplifying the conservation prioritisation procedure.",

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the massive amount of data generated by modern sequencing technologies provides an unprecedented opportunity to find genes associated with cancer patient prognosis, connecting basic and translational research. However, treating high dimensionality of gene expression data and integrating it with clinical variables are major challenges to carry out these analyses. Here, we present Reboot, an original and efficient algorithm to find genes and splicing isoforms associated with cancer patient survival, disease progression, or other clinical endpoints. Reboot innovates by using a multivariate strategy with penalized Cox regression (LASSO method) combined with a bootstrap approach, in addition to statistical tests for supporting the findings, which are automatically plotted. Applying Reboot on data from 154 glioblastoma patients, we identified a three-gene signature (IKBIP, OSMR, PODNL1) whose increased derived risk score was significantly associated with worse patients prognosis, even in conjunction with other well-established clinical parameters. Similarly, Reboot was able to find a seven-splicing isoforms signature (CENPF-201; MLKL-202; NUP54-201; MCF2L-201; TFDP1-207; BBS1-206; HTT-202) related to worse overall survival in 177 pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients with elevated risk scores after uni- and multivariate analyses. In summary, Reboot is an efficient, intuitive, and straightforward way for finding genes or splicing isoforms (transcripts) signatures relevant to patient prognosis, which can democratize this kind of analysis and shed light on still under-investigated sets of cancer-related genes. Reboot effectively runs on either servers or personal computers and it is freely available at github.com/galantelab/reboot.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome mining for Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) has become an integral part of natural product discovery. The >200,000 microbial genomes now publicly available hold information on abundant novel chemistry. One way to navigate this vast genomic diversity is through comparative analysis of homologous BGCs, which allows identification of cross-species patterns that can be matched to the presence of metabolites or biological activities. However, current tools suffer from a bottleneck caused by the expensive network-based approach used to group these BGCs into Gene Cluster Families (GCFs).\n\nResultsHere, we introduce BiG-SLiCE, a tool designed to cluster massive numbers of BGCs. By representing them in Euclidean space, BiG-SLiCE can group BGCs into GCFs in a non-pairwise, near-linear fashion. We used BiG-SLiCE to analyze 1,225,071 BGCs collected from 209,206 publicly available microbial genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) within ten days on a typical 36-cores CPU server. We demonstrate the utility of such analyses by reconstructing a global map of secondary metabolic diversity across taxonomy to identify uncharted biosynthetic potential. BiG-SLiCE also provides a \"query mode\" that can efficiently place newly sequenced BGCs into previously computed GCFs, plus a powerful output visualization engine that facilitates user-friendly data exploration.\n\nConclusionsBiG-SLiCE opens up new possibilities to accelerate natural product discovery and offers a first step towards constructing a global, searchable interconnected network of BGCs. As more genomes get sequenced from understudied taxa, more information can be mined to highlight their potentially novel chemistry.

    "abstract": "To avoid replicative senescence or telomere-induced apoptosis, cancers employ telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs) involving either the upregulation of telomerase or the acquisition of recombination-based alternative telomere lengthening (ALT). The choice of TMM may differentially influence cancer evolution and be exploitable in targeted therapies. Here, we examine TMMs in a panel of seventeen osteosarcoma-derived cell lines defining three separate groups according to TMM. Eight were ALT-positive, including the previously uncharacterised lines, KPD and LM7. ALT-negative cell lines were further classified into two groups according to their telomere length. HOS-MNNG, OHSN, SJSA-1, HAL, 143b and HOS displayed sub-normally short telomere length, while MG-63, MHM and HuO-3N1 displayed long telomeres. Importantly, sub-normally short telomeres were significantly associated with hypersensitivity to three different therapeutics targeting the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) kinase - AZD-6738/Ceralasertib, VE-822/Berzoserib and BAY-1895344 - compared to long telomeres, maintained via ALT or telomerase. Within 24 hours of ATR inhibition, cells with short but not long telomeres displayed chromosome bridges and underwent cell death, indicating a selective dependency on ATR for chromosome stability. Collectively, our work provides a resource to identify links between TMMs and drug sensitivity in osteosarcoma and indicates that telomere length predicts ATR-inhibitor sensitivity in cancer.",

Two theories have been proposed to explain acetate overflow in Escherichia coli - global control of the central metabolism and local control of the acetate pathway - but neither accounts for all observations. Here, we develop a kinetic model of E. coli metabolism that quantitatively accounts for observed behaviors and successfully predicts the response of E. coli to new perturbations. We reconcile these theories and clarify the origin, control and regulation of the acetate flux. We also find that, in turns, acetate regulates glucose metabolism by coordinating the expression of glycolytic and TCA genes. Acetate should not be considered a wasteful end-product since it is also a co-substrate and a global regulator of glucose metabolism in E. coli. This has broad implications for our understanding of overflow metabolism.",

Thirty participants were presented with audio definitions, half referring to affective (e.g. empathetic) and half to non-affective concepts (e.g. intelligent). Orthogonally, half of the concepts were highly likable (e.g. sincere) and half were socially undesirable (e.g. liar). We used a support vector machine to delineate how both concept dimensions are represented in a set of 9 a priori brain regions defined from previous meta-analyses on semantic and social cognition. We show that average decoding in semantic regions (e.g. lateral temporal lobe, inferior frontal gyrus, and precuneus) outperformed social ROIs (e.g. insula and anterior cingulate), with the lateral temporal lobe containing the highest amount of information about the affect and likableness of social concepts. We also found that the insula had a bias towards affect while the likableness dimension was better represented in anterior cingulate cortex. Our results do not support a modular view of social knowledge representation. They rather indicate that the brain representation of social concepts implicates a distributed network of regions that involves  domain-specific social cognitive systems, but with a greater dependence on language-semantic processing.",

There are, however, limitations in those studies including the relatively weak manipulation of task due to the use of familiar real-life objects, the low temporal resolution in fMRI, and the emphasis on the amount and not the source of information carried by brain activations. In the current study, observers categorized images of artificial objects in one of two orthogonal dimensions, shape and texture, while their brain activity was recorded with electroencephalogram (EEG). Results showed that object processing along the texture dimension was affected by task demand starting from a relatively late time (320-370ms time window) after image onset.

Yet how the [Cl-]i changes depend on the properties of glutamatergic inputs and their spatiotemporal relation to GABAergic stimuli is unknown. To investigate this issue, we used compartmental biophysical models of Cl- dynamics simulating either a simple ball-and-stick topology or a reconstructed immature CA3 neuron. These computational experiments demonstrated that glutamatergic co-stimulation enhances GABA receptor-mediated Cl- influx at low and attenuates or reverses the Cl- efflux at high initial [Cl-]i. The size of glutamatergic influence on GABAergic Cl--fluxes depends on the conductance, decay kinetics, and localization of glutamatergic inputs. Surprisingly, the glutamatergic shift in GABAergic Cl--fluxes is invariant to latencies between GABAergic and glutamatergic inputs over a substantial interval. In agreement with experimental data, simulations in a reconstructed CA3 pyramidal neuron with physiological patterns of correlated activity revealed that coincident glutamatergic synaptic inputs contribute significantly to the activity-dependent [Cl-]i changes. Whereas the influence of spatial correlation between distributed glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs was negligible, their temporal correlation played a significant role. In summary, our results demonstrate that glutamatergic co-stimulation had a substantial impact on ionic plasticity of GABAergic responses, enhancing the destabilization of GABAergic inhibition in the mature nervous systems, but suppressing GABAergic [Cl-]i changes in the immature brain. Therefore, glutamatergic shift in GABAergic Cl--fluxes should be considered as a relevant factor of short term plasticity.\n\nAuthor SummaryInformation processing in the brain requires that excitation and inhibition are balanced. The main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain is gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA). GABA actions depend on the Cl--gradient, but activation of ionotropic GABA receptors causes Cl--fluxes and thus reduces GABAergic inhibition. Here, we investigated how a coincident membrane depolarization by excitatory, glutamatergic synapses influences GABA-induced Cl--fluxes using a biophysical compartmental model of Cl- dynamics, simulating either simple or realistic neuron topologies. We demonstrate that glutamatergic co-stimulation directly affects GABA-induced Cl--fluxes, with the size of glutamatergic effects depending on the conductance, the decay kinetics, and localization of glutamatergic inputs. We also show that the glutamatergic shift in GABAergic Cl--fluxes is surprisingly stable over a substantial range of latencies between glutamatergic and GABAergic inputs. We conclude from these results that glutamatergic co-stimulation alters GABAergic Cl--fluxes and in turn affects the strength of GABAergic inhibition. These coincidence-dependent ionic changes should be considered as a relevant factor of short term plasticity in the CNS.",

    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with altered GABAergic and glutamatergic signalling, suggesting altered excitation-inhibition balance (EIB) in cortical mood- and cognition-regulating brain regions. Information processing in cortical microcircuits involves regulation of pyramidal (PYR) cells by Somatostatin-(SST), Parvalbumin-(PV), and Vasoactive intestinal peptide-(VIP) expressing interneurons. Human and rodent studies suggest that impaired PYR-cell dendritic morphology and decreased SST-cell function may mediate altered EIB in MDD. However, knowledge of co-ordinated changes across microcircuit cell types is virtually absent. We thus investigated the co-ordinated transcriptomic effects of UCMS on microcircuit cell types in the medial prefrontal cortex. C57Bl/6 mice, exposed to unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS) or control housing for five weeks were assessed for anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours. Microcircuit cell types were laser-microdissected and processed for RNA-sequencing. UCMS-exposed mice displayed predicted elevated behavioural emotionality. Each microcircuit cell type showed a unique transcriptional signature after UCMS. Pre-synaptic functions, oxidative stress response, metabolism, and translational regulation were differentially dysregulated across cell types, whereas nearly all cell types showed down-regulated post-synaptic gene signatures. At the microcircuit level, we observed a shift from distributed transcriptomic co-ordination across cell types in controls towards UCMS-induced increased co-ordination between PYR-, SST- and PV-cells, and a hub-like role for PYR-cells. Lastly, we identified a microcircuit-wide co-expression network enriched in synaptic, bioenergetic, and oxidative stress response genes that correlated with UCMS-induced behaviours. Together, these findings suggest cell-specific deficits, microcircuit-wide synaptic reorganization, and a shift in cortical EIB mediated by increased co-ordinated regulation of PYR-cells by SST- and PV-cells.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrion is critical for the survival of apicomplexan parasites. Several major anti-parasitic drugs, such as atovaquone and endochin-like quinolones, act through inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain at the coenzyme Q:cytochrome c oxidoreductase complex (Complex III). Despite being an important drug target, the protein composition of Complex III of apicomplexan parasites has not been elucidated. Here, we undertake a mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of Complex III in the apicomplexan Toxoplasma gondii. Along with canonical subunits that are conserved across eukaryotic evolution, we identify several novel or highly divergent Complex III components that are conserved within the apicomplexan lineage. We demonstrate that one such subunit, which we term TgQCR11, is critical for parasite proliferation, mitochondrial oxygen consumption and Complex III activity, and establish that loss of this protein leads to defects in Complex III integrity. We conclude that the protein composition of Complex III in apicomplexans differs from that of the mammalian hosts that these parasites infect.\n\nAuthor summaryApicomplexan parasites cause numerous diseases in humans and animals, including malaria (Plasmodium species) and toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii). The coenzyme Q:cytochrome c oxidoreductase protein complex (Complex III) performs a central role in the mitochondrial electron transport chain of many eukaryotes. Despite being the target of several major anti-apicomplexan drugs, the protein composition of Complex III in apicomplexans was previously unknown. Our work identifies novel proteins in Complex III of apicomplexans, one of which is critical for complex function and integrity. Our study highlights divergent features of Complex III in apicomplexans, and provides a broader understanding of Complex III evolution in eukaryotes. Our study also provides important insights into what sets this major drug target apart from the equivalent complex in host species.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers harbor binding motifs that recruit transcription factors (TFs) for gene activation. While cooperative binding of TFs at enhancers is known to be critical for transcriptional activation of a handful of developmental enhancers, the extent TF cooperativity genome-wide is unknown. Here, we couple high-resolution nuclease footprinting with single-molecule methylation profiling to characterize TF cooperativity at active enhancers in the Drosophila genome. Enrichment of short MNase-protected DNA segments indicates that the majority of enhancers harbor two or more TF binding sites, and we uncover protected fragments that correspond to co-bound sites in thousands of enhancers. We integrate MNase-seq, methylation accessibility profiling, and CUT&RUN chromatin profiling as a comprehensive strategy to characterize co-binding of the Trithorax-like (TRL) DNA binding protein and multiple other TFs and identify states where an enhancer is bound by no TF, by either single factor, by multiple factors, or where binding sites are occluded by nucleosomes. From the analysis of co-binding, we find that cooperativity dominates TF binding in vivo at a majority of active enhancers. TF cooperativity can occur without apparent protein-protein interactions and provides a mechanism to effectively clear nucleosomes and promote enhancer function.",

Based on datasets in open, forest, and mixed habitats, we used the spatial distribution of floristic diversity to estimate the source area of pollen diversity and identify factors influencing the significance of this relationship.\n\nOur study areas are Bohemian-Moravian Highlands and White Carpathians (the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic).\n\nSampling 60 sites in forest and open habitats in two study regions with contrasting floristic diversity, we calculated taxonomic richness (alpha diversity) and total spatial variance (beta diversity) for pollen and floristic data along two transects, each 1 km long. Following this, we calculated the correlation between floristic and pollen diversity. We also assessed the consistency of the relationship in different habitats. Finally, we regressed local contributions of individual sites to the beta diversity of pollen and floristic data in each of the regions.\n\nThere was a positive correlation between pollen and floristic richness in both habitats in both regions; open and mixed datasets were significant. The highest correlation (adjusted R2) mostly occurred within the first tens of metres (1.5-70) and then within the first hundreds of metres (250-550). Variances of pollen data significantly correlated with variances of floristic data between 100 and 250 m. Local contributions to beta diversity of pollen and plants significantly correlated in the forest and one of the mixed datasets.\n\nFloristic richness at the pollen site and position of the site within the landscape structure determine the sequence of the appearing species in the increasing distance. The number of species sets the source area of pollen richness and dissimilarity of appearing species controls the source area of pollen variance. These findings, linking pollen and floristic diversity, provide an essential stepping-stone for the reconstruction of historic plant diversity.",

We were able to remove a significant number of haplotypic contigs, detect more genetic variation and improve the contiguity of the genome, especially that of X chromosome. However, improved scaffolding cannot correct for mosaicism of erroneously assembled contigs, demonstrated by a de novo assembly of a 1.7 Mbp inversion. Qualitatively similar gains were obtained with the genome of three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Since the utility of genome-wide sequencing data in biological research depends heavily on the quality of the reference genome, the improved and fully automated approach described here should be helpful in refining reference genome assemblies.",

Given a lack of persistent tertiary structure, all of the residues in an IDR are, to some extent, solvent exposed. This extensive surface area, coupled with the absence of strong intramolecular contacts, makes IDRs inherently sensitive to their chemical environment. Despite this sensitivity, our understanding of how IDR structural ensembles are influenced by changes in their chemical environment is limited. This is particularly relevant given a growing body of evidence showing that IDR function is linked to the underlying structural ensemble. We develop and use a combined experimental, computational, and analytical framework for high-throughput characterization of IDR sensitivity we call solution space scanning. Our framework reveals that IDRs show sequence-dependent sensitivity to solution chemistry, with complex behavior that can be interpreted through relatively simple polymer models. Our results imply that solution-responsive IDRs are ubiquitous and can provide an additional layer of biological regulation.",

The box tree moth, Cydalima perspectalis, is an Asian pest whose rapid invasion in Europe cause considerable economic and ecological impacts. Larvae enter a winter diapause induced by photoperiod in both native and invaded ranges, but factors that trigger the return to an active phase are still unknown. Yet, identifying them is crucial to understand how diapause end synchronizes with the end of the winter stress encountered in Europe. To test whether activity resumption is regulated by thermal and/or photoperiodic thresholds, or additive effects between these factors often involved in diapause termination, diapausing caterpillars from an invaded area were exposed to crossed treatments at the laboratory. The evolution of diapause rate was monitored over time and compared to that of nearby field sites invaded. A strong positive effect of increasing temperature was found on the rate and dynamics of diapause termination, whereas no compelling effect of photoperiod appeared. Resuming development directly when main stressors fade, not in response to indirect photoperiodic cues that could be mismatched outside native areas, likely contributes to the good match observed between diapause and the new climates this pest encountered in the invaded range.",

Accordingly, we have used mass spectrometry to explore how ERK signalling pathways control antigen receptor driven proteome restructuring in CD8 + T cells to gain insights about the biological processes controlled by ERKs in primary lymphocytes. Quantitative analysis of >8000 proteins identified only 900 ERK regulated proteins in activated CD8+ T cells. The data identify both positive and negative regulatory roles for ERKs during T cell activation and reveal that ERK signalling primarily controls the repertoire of transcription factors, cytokines and cytokine receptors expressed by activated T cells.

In the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, susceptibility of the resident microbial community to invasion by pathogens has important implications for host health. However, at the community level, it is unclear whether susceptibility to invasion depends mostly on resident community composition (which microbes are present), or also on local abiotic conditions (such as nutrient status). Here, we used a gut microcosm system to disentangle some of the drivers of susceptibility to invasion in microbial communities sampled from humans. We found resident microbial communities inhibited an invading E. coli strain, compared to community-free control treatments, sometimes excluding the invader completely (colonization resistance). These effects were stronger at later time points, coinciding with shifts in microbial community composition and nutrient availability. By separating these two components (microbial community and abiotic environment), we found taxonomic composition played a crucial role in suppressing invasion, but this depended critically on local abiotic conditions (adapted communities were more suppressive in nutrient-depleted conditions). This helps predict when resident communities will be most susceptible to invasion, with implications for optimizing treatments based around microbiota management.",

The ability to sequence genomes from old specimens has expanded not only the variety of interesting taxa available to study but also the scope of questions that can be investigated in order to further knowledge about biodiversity. Here we present whole genome sequencing results from the enigmatic genus Whalleyana, as well as the families Callidulidae and Hyblaeidae. Library preparation was carried out on four museum specimens and one existing DNA extract and sequenced with Illumina short reads. De novo assembly resulted in highly fragmented genomes with the N50 ranging from 317 - 2,078 bp. Mining of a manually curated gene set of 332 genes from these draft genomes had an overall gene recovery rate of 64 - 90%. Phylogenetic analysis places Whalleyana as sister to Callidulidae, and Hyblaea as sister to Pyraloidea. Since the former sister-group relationship turns out to be also supported by ten morphological synapomorphies, we propose to formally assign the Whalleyanidae to the superfamily Calliduloidea. These results highlight the usefulness of not only museum specimens, but also existing DNA extracts, for whole genome sequencing and gene mining for phylogenomic studies.",

    "abstract": "Normothermic ex-vivo kidney perfusion (NEVKP) results in significantly improved graft function in porcine auto-transplant models of DCD injury compared to static cold storage (SCS); however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects remain unclear. We performed an unbiased proteomics analysis of 28 kidney biopsies obtained at 3 time points from pig kidneys subjected to 30-minutes of warm ischemia, followed by 8 hours of NEVKP or SCS, and auto-transplantation. 70/6593 proteins quantified were differentially expressed between NEVKP and SCS groups (FDR<0.05). Proteins increased in NEVKP mediated key metabolic processes including fatty acid {beta}-oxidation, the TCA-cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Comparison of our findings with external datasets of ischemia-reperfusion, and other models of kidney injury confirmed that 47 of our proteins represent a common signature of kidney injury reversed or attenuated by NEVKP. We validated key metabolic proteins (ETFB, CPT2) by immunoblotting. Transcription factor databases identified PPARGC1A, PPARA/G/D and RXRA/B as the upstream regulators of our dataset, and we confirmed their increased expression in NEVKP with RT-PCR. The proteome-level changes observed in NEVKP mediate critical metabolic pathways that may explain the improved graft function observed. These effects may be coordinated by PPAR-family transcription factors, and may represent novel therapeutic targets in ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

    "abstract": "Cells trigger apoptosis to eliminate themselves from the system, when tissue needs to be sculptured or they detect any abnormality within them, thus preventing irreparable damage to the host. Drosophila Malpighian tubules express apoptotic proteins, without succumbing to cell death. Here we present evidence to show apoptosis independent role of executioner caspase, Drice, for precise architecture and function of Malpighian tubules. Drice is required for precise cytoskeleton organization and convergent extension, failing which the morphology, size, cellular number and arrangement gets affected. Acquisition of star shape of stellate cells in adult Malpighian tubules requires Drice. We demonstrate that Drice regulates expression of Rho1GTPase and localization of polarity proteins. Our study shows a probable mechanism by which Drice governs tubulogenesis via Rho1GTPase mediated coordinated organization of actin cytoskeleton and membrane stablisation. Furthermore, defective morphology of tubules leads to abnormal osmoregulation and excretory functions. Collectively our findings suggest a possible non-apoptotic function of caspase-3 in the fine tuning of cell mobility during tubule development and our results will add to the growing understanding of diverse roles of caspases during its evolution in metazoans.",

Serum antibody titers measured by anti-spike ELISA were above 1:1,000,000, and neutralizing antibody titer was 1:14,604 (average PRNT90), which is 140-fold higher than the average neutralizing titer of plasma from three convalescent COVID-19 patients analyzed for comparison. Using the same technology routinely used for industrial production of other horse hyperimmune products, plasma from immunized animals was pepsin digested to remove the Fc portion and purified, yielding a F(ab)2 preparation with PRNT90 titers 150-fold higher than the neutralizing titers in human convalescent plasma. Repeating the hyperimmunization in a second group of horses confirmed the very high neutralizing titers in serum and in a GMP clinical F(ab)2 lot. Virus-neutralizing activity in samples from mice that received the F(ab)2 preparation was detected even three days after injection, indicating an appropriate half-life for therapeutic intervention.

To address the urgent need for treatment options, we carried out a quantitative high-throughput screen using a SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic assay with a compound collection of 8,810 approved and investigational drugs, mechanism-based bioactive compounds, and natural products. Three hundred and nineteen compounds with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities were identified and confirmed, including 91 approved drug and 49 investigational drugs. Among these confirmed compounds, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities of 230 compounds, including 38 approved drugs, have not been previously reported. Chlorprothixene, methotrimeprazine, and piperacetazine were the three most potent FDA approved drugs with anti-SARS-CoV-2 activities.

    "abstract": "The human microbiota has a close relationship with human disease and it remodels components of the glycocalyx including heparan sulfate (HS). Studies of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein receptor binding domain suggest that infection requires binding to HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in a codependent manner. Here, we show that commensal host bacterial communities can modify HS and thereby modulate SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding and that these communities change with host age and sex. Common human-associated commensal bacteria whose genomes encode HS-modifying enzymes were identified. The prevalence of these bacteria and the expression of key microbial glycosidases in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was lower in adult COVID-19 patients than in healthy controls. The presence of HS-modifying bacteria decreased with age in two large survey datasets, FINRISK 2002 and American Gut, revealing one possible mechanism for the observed increase in COVID-19 susceptibility with age. In vitro, bacterial glycosidases from unpurified culture media supernatants fully blocked SARS-CoV-2 spike binding to human H1299 protein lung adenocarcinoma cells. HS-modifying bacteria in human microbial communities may regulate viral adhesion, and loss of these commensals could predispose individuals to infection. Understanding the impact of shifts in microbial community composition and bacterial lyases on SARS-CoV-2 infection may lead to new therapeutics and diagnosis of susceptibility.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/238444v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14ff1ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@193d84corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15d6f9eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b16c6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical Abstract.

    "abstract": "The transcription factor GATA4 is broadly expressed in nascent foregut endoderm. As development progresses, GATA4 is lost in the domain giving rise to the stratified squamous epithelium of the esophagus and forestomach (FS), while it is maintained in the domain giving rise to the simple columnar epithelium of the hindstomach (HS). Differential GATA4 expression within these domains coincides with the onset of distinct tissue morphogenetic events, suggesting a role for GATA4 in diversifying foregut endoderm into discrete esophageal/FS and HS tissues. By eliminating GATA4 in the developing HS or maintaining GATA4 in the developing FS, we identified GATA4 as an essential, principal regulator of simple columnar epithelium morphogenesis within the developing HS. GATA4- deficient HS epithelium adopted FS-like fate, and conversely, GATA4- expressing FS epithelium adopted HS-like fate. Underlying structural changes in these epithelia were broad changes in gene expression networks attributable to GATA4 directly activating or repressing expression of HS or FS defining transcripts. Our data implicate GATA4 as having a primary role in suppressing an esophageal/FS transcription factor network during HS development to promote a columnar epithelium. Moreover, GATA4-dependent phenotypes in developmental mutants reflected changes associated with Barretts esophagus, suggesting that developmental biology can provide insight into human disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Integrated, up-to-date data about SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is crucial for the ongoing response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the biomedical research community. While rich biological knowledge exists for SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV), integrating this knowledge is difficult and time consuming, since much of it is in siloed databases or in textual format. Furthermore, the data required by the research community varies drastically for different tasks - the optimal data for a machine learning task, for example, is much different from the data used to populate a browsable user interface for clinicians. To address these challenges, we created KG-COVID-19, a flexible framework that ingests and integrates biomedical data to produce knowledge graphs (KGs) for COVID-19 response. This KG framework can also be applied to other problems in which siloed biomedical data must be quickly integrated for different research applications, including future pandemics.\n\nBIGGER PICTUREAn effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic relies on integration of many different types of data available about SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. KG-COVID-19 is a framework for producing knowledge graphs that can be customized for downstream applications including machine learning tasks, hypothesis-based querying, and browsable user interface to enable researchers to explore COVID-19 data and discover relationships.",

    "abstract": "Oligosaccharyltransferases (OSTs) are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of a glycan chain to an acceptor protein. Their structure is composed by a transmembrane domain and a periplasmic / C-terminal domain, which can be divided into structural units. The Archaeoglobus fulgidus OST, AfAglB, has unique structural units with unknown functions. Here, we evaluate the stability role proposed for AfAglB units by employing molecular modelling and molecular dynamics simulations, to examine the effect of single and double deletions in the enzyme structure. Our results show a strong effect on the dynamics of the C-terminal domain for the mutated systems with increased fluctuations near the deleted areas. Conformational profile and stability are deeply affected, mainly in the double unit deletion, modifying the enzyme behavior and binding interfaces. Coordination at the catalytic site was not disrupted, indicating that the mutated enzymes could retain activity at some level. Hotspots of variation were identified and rationalized with previous data. Our data shows that structural units may provide stabilization interactions, contributing for integrity of the wild-type enzyme at high temperatures. By correlating our findings to structural units mutagenesis experimental data available, it was observed that structural units deletion can interfere with OSTs stability and dynamics but it is not directly related to catalysis. Instead, they may influence the OST structural integrity, and, potentially, thermostability. This work offers a basis for future experiments involving OSTs structural and functional characterization, as well as for protein engineering.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that eukaryotic cells can sense oxygen (O2) and adapt their metabolism accordingly. It is less known that they can also move towards regions of higher oxygen level (aerotaxis). Using a self-generated hypoxic assay, we show that the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum displays a spectacular aerotactic behavior. When a cell colony is covered by a coverglass, cells quickly consume the available O2 and the ones close to the periphery move directionally outward forming a dense ring keeping a constant speed and density. To confirm that O2 is the main molecular player in this seemingly collective process, we combined two technological developments, porphyrin based O2 sensing films and microfluidic O2 gradient generators. We showed that Dictyostelium cells exhibit aerotactic and aerokinetic (increased speed at low O2) response in an extremely low range of O2 concentration (0-1.5%) indicative of a very efficient detection mechanism. The various cell behaviors under self-generated or imposed O2 gradients were modeled with a very satisfactory quantitative agreement using an in silico cellular Potts model built on experimental observations. This computational model was complemented with a parsimonious  Go or Grow partial differential equation (PDE) model. In both models, we found that the collective migration of a dense ring can be explained by the interplay between cell division and the modulation of aerotaxis, without the need for cell-cell communication.",

    "abstract": "Auxin is a key phytohormone that is integral to plant developmental processes including those underlying root initiation, elongation, and branching. Beneficial microbes have been shown to have an impact on root development, potentially mediated through auxin. In this study, we explore the role of host auxin signaling and transport components in mediating the root growth promoting effects of beneficial microbes. Towards this end, we undertook co-culture studies of Arabidopsis thaliana plants with microbes previously reported to promote lateral root proliferation and produce auxin. Two types of beneficial microbes were included in the present study; a plant growth promoting bacterial species of interest, Pseudomonas fluorescens GM30, and a well-studied plant growth promoting fungal species, Serendipita indica (Piriformospora indica). Following co-culture, lateral root production was found restored in auxin transport inhibitor-treated plants, suggesting involvement of microbe and/or microbially-produced auxin in altering plant auxin levels. In order to clarify the role of host auxin signaling and transport pathways in mediating interactions with bacterial and fungal species, we employed a suite of auxin genetic mutants as hosts in co-culture screens. Our result show that the transport proteins PIN2, PIN3, and PIN7 and the signaling protein ARF19, are required for mediating root architecture effects by the bacterial and/or fungal species. Mutants corresponding to these proteins did not significantly respond to co-culture treatment and did not show increases in lateral root production and lateral root density. These results implicate the importance of host auxin signaling in both bacterial and fungal induced changes in root architecture and serve as a driver for future research on understanding the role of auxin-dependent and auxin-independent pathways in mediating plant-microbe interactions in economically important crop species.",

    "abstract": "Failure to maintain DNA methylation patterns during plant development can occasionally give rise to so-called  spontaneous epimutations. These stochastic methylation changes are sometimes heritable across generations and thus accumulate in plant genomes over time. Recent evidence indicates that spontaneous epimutations have a major role in shaping patterns of methylation diversity in plant populations. Using single CG dinucleotides as units of analysis, previous work has shown that the epimutation rate is several orders of magnitude higher than the genetic mutation rate. While these large rate differences have obvious implications for understanding genome-methylome co-evolution, the functional relevance of single CG methylation changes remains questionable. In contrast to single CG, solid experimental evidence has linked methylation gains and losses in larger genomic regions with transcriptional variation and heritable phentoypic effects. Here we show that such region-level changes arise stochastically at about the same rate as those at individual CG sites, are only marginal dependent on region size and cytosine density, but strongly dependent on chromosomal location. We also find consistent evidence that region-level epimutations are not restricted to CG contexts but also frequently occur in non-CG regions at the genome-wide scale. Taken together, our results support the view that many differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in natural populations originate from epimutational events and may not be effectively tagged by proximal SNPs. This possibility reinforces the need for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in plants as away to identify the epigenetic basis of adaptive traits.",

    "abstract": "Proprioception, the sense of limb and body position, generates a map of the body that is essential for proper motor control, yet we know little about precisely how neurons in proprioceptive pathways are wired. Defining the anatomy of secondary neurons in the spinal cord that integrate and relay proprioceptive and potentially cutaneous information from the periphery to the cerebellum is fundamental to understanding how proprioceptive circuits function. Here, we use genetic tools in both male and female mice to define the unique anatomical trajectories of long-range direct and indirect spinocerebellar pathways as well as local intersegmental spinal circuits. We find that Clarkes column (CC) neurons, a major contributor to the direct spinocerebellar pathway, has mossy fiber terminals that diversify extensively in the cerebellar cortex with axons terminating bilaterally, but with no significant axon collaterals within the spinal cord, medulla, or cerebellar nuclei. By contrast, we find that two of the indirect pathways, the spino-lateral reticular nucleus (spino-LRt) and spino-olivary pathways, are in part, derived from cervical Atoh1-lineage neurons, while thoracolumbar Atoh1-lineage neurons project mostly locally within the spinal cord. Notably, while cervical and thoracolumbar Atoh1-lineage neurons connect locally with motor neurons, no CC to motor neuron connections were detected. Silencing of caudal Atoh1- lineage neurons results in a subtle motor impairment consistent with a defect in local proprioceptive circuitry. Altogether, we define anatomical differences between long-range direct, indirect, and local proprioceptive subcircuits that likely mediate different components of proprioceptive-motor behaviors.\n\nSignificance StatementWe define the anatomy of long-range direct and indirect spinocerebellar pathways as well as local spinal proprioceptive circuits. We observe that mossy fiber axon terminals of Clarkes column (CC) neurons diversify proprioceptive information across granule cells in multiple lobules on both ipsilateral and contralateral sides sending no significant collaterals within the spinal cord, medulla, or cerebellar nuclei. Strikingly, we find that cervical spinal cord Atoh1-lineage neurons form mainly the indirect spino- lateral reticular nucleus and spino-olivary tracts and thoracolumbar Atoh1-lineage neurons project locally within the spinal cord while only a few Atoh1-lineage neurons form a direct spinocerebellar tract. Altogether, we define the development, anatomical projections, and some behavioral consequences of silencing spinal proprioceptive pathways.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memory involves the reinstatement of distributed patterns of brain activity present when events were initially experienced. The hippocampus is thought to coordinate reinstatement via its interactions with a network of brain regions, but this hypothesis has not been causally tested in humans. The current study directly tested the involvement of the hippocampal network in reinstatement using network-targeted noninvasive stimulation. We measured reinstatement of multi-voxel patterns of fMRI activity during encoding and retrieval of naturalistic video clips depicting everyday activities. Reinstatement of video-specific activity patterns was robust in posterior-parietal and occipital areas previously implicated in event reinstatement. Theta-burst stimulation targeting the hippocampal network increased videospecific reinstatement of fMRI activity patterns in occipital cortex and improved memory accuracy relative to stimulation of a control out-of-network location. Furthermore, stimulation targeting the hippocampal network influenced the trial-by-trial relationship between hippocampal activity during encoding and later reinstatement in occipital cortex. These findings implicate the hippocampal network in the reinstatement of spatially distributed patterns of event-specific activity, and identify a role for the hippocampus in encoding complex naturalistic events that later undergo cortical reinstatement.",

Here we find that A-P and D-V genomic patterning of cortical surface area (SA) and thickness (CT) is intact in typically developing and autistic toddlers with good language outcome, but is absent in autistic toddlers with poor early language outcome.

These genes are also important for vocal learning, human-specific evolution, and prenatal co-expression networks enriched for high-penetrance autism risk genes.

    "abstract": "The functional role of spontaneous brain activity, especially in relation to external events, is a longstanding key question in neuroscience. Intrinsic and externally-evoked activities were suggested to be anticorrelated, yet inferring an antagonistic mechanism between them remains a challenge. Here, we used beta-band (15-30 Hz) power as a proxy of spontaneous activity in the rat somatosensory cortex during a detection task. Beta-power anticorrelated with sensory-evoked-responses, and high rates of spontaneously occurring beta-bursts predicted reduced detection. By applying a burst-rate detection algorithm in real-time and trial-by-trial stimulus-intensity adjustment, this influence could be counterbalanced. Mechanistically, bursts in all bands indicated transient synchronization of cell assemblies, but only beta-bursts were followed by a reduction in firing-rate. Our findings reveal that spontaneous beta-bursts reflect a dynamic state that competes with external stimuli.",

    "abstract": "The role of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine in reward, cue processing, and interval timing is well characterized. Using a combinatorial viral approach to target activating DREADDs (Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs, hM3D) to GABAergic neurons in the VTA of male rats, we previously showed that activation disrupts responding to reward-predictive cues. Here we explored how VTA GABA neurons influence the perception of time in two fixed interval (FI) tasks, one where the reward or interval is not paired with predictive cues (Non-Cued FI), and another where the start of the FI is signaled by a constant tone that continues until the rewarded response is emitted (Cued FI). Under vehicle conditions in both tasks, responding was characterized by \"scalloping\" over the 30s FI, in which responding increased towards the end of the FI. However, when VTA GABA neurons were activated in the Non-Cued FI, the time between the end of the 30s interval and when the rats made a reinforced response increased. Additionally, post-reinforcement pauses and overall session length increased. In the Cued FI task, VTA GABA activation produced erratic responding, with a decrease in earned rewards. Thus, while both tasks were disrupted by VTA GABA activation, responding that is constrained by a cue was more sensitive to this manipulation, possibly due to convergent effects on timing and cue processing. Together these results demonstrate that VTA GABA activity disrupts the perception of interval timing, particularly when the timing is set by cues.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal oscillations emerge in early human development. These periodic oscillations are thought to rapidly change in infancy and stabilize during maturity. Given their numerous connections to physiological and cognitive processes, as well as their pathological divergence, understanding the trajectory of oscillatory development is important for understanding healthy human brain development. This understanding is complicated by recent evidence that assessment of periodic neuronal oscillations is confounded by aperiodic neuronal activity, which is an inherent feature of electrophysiological neuronal recordings. Recent cross-sectional evidence shows that this aperiodic signal progressively shifts from childhood through early adulthood, and from early adulthood into later life. None of these studies, however, have been performed in infants, nor have they been examined longitudinally. Here, we analyzed non-invasive EEG data from 22 typically developing infants, across multiple time points, ranging between 38 and 203 days old. We show that the progressive flattening of the EEG power spectrum begins in very early development, continuing through the first several months of life. These results highlight the importance of separating the periodic and aperiodic neuronal signals, because the aperiodic signal can bias measurement of neuronal oscillations. Given the infrequent, bursting nature of oscillations in infants, we recommend the use of quantitative time domain approaches that isolate bursts and uncover changes in waveform properties of oscillatory bursts.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in scene imagination, autobiographical memory recall, future thinking and spatial navigation have long been linked with hippocampal structure in healthy people, although evidence for such relationships is, in fact, mixed. Extant studies have predominantly concentrated on hippocampal volume. However, it is now possible to use quantitative neuroimaging techniques to model different properties of tissue microstructure in vivo such as myelination and iron. Previous work has linked such measures with cognitive task performance, particularly in older adults. Here we investigated whether performance on scene imagination, autobiographical memory, future thinking and spatial navigation tasks was associated with hippocampal grey matter myelination or iron content in young, healthy adult participants. MRI data were collected using a multi-parameter mapping protocol (0.8mm isotropic voxels) from a large sample of 217 people with widely-varying cognitive task scores. We found little evidence that hippocampal grey matter myelination or iron content was related to task performance. This was the case using different analysis methods (voxel-based quantification, partial correlations), when whole brain, hippocampal regions of interest, and posterior:anterior hippocampal ratios were examined, and across different participant sub-groups (divided by gender, task performance). Variations in hippocampal grey matter myelin and iron levels may not, therefore, help to explain individual differences in performance on hippocampal-dependent tasks, at least in young, healthy individuals.",

This discordance illustrates the need for a more unifying explanation as to whether SARS-CoV-2 directly or indirectly affects erythropoiesis. Here we show significantly enriched CD71+ erythroid precursors/progenitors in the blood circulation of COVID-19 patients that have distinctive immunosuppressive properties. A subpopulation of abundant erythroid cells, CD45+CD71+cells, co-express ACE2, TMPRSS2, CD147, CD26 and these can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. In turn, pre-treatment of erythroid cells with dexamethasone significantly diminished ACE2/TMPRSS2 expression and subsequently reduced their infectivity with SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, pathological abundance of erythroid cells might reflect stress erythropoiesis due to the invasion of erythroid progenitors by SARS-CoV-2. This may provide a novel insight into the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on erythropoiesis and hypoxia seen in COVID-19 patients.",

AMP immunogens are efficiently delivered to lymph nodes, where innate and adaptive immune responses are generated. Compared to alum, AMP immunization induced >25-fold higher antigen-specific T cells which produced multiple Th1 cytokines and trafficked into lung parenchyma and respiratory secretions. Antibody responses favored Th1 isotypes (IgG2bc, IgG3) and potently neutralized Spike-2-ACE2 receptor binding, with titers 265-fold higher than the natural immune response from convalescent COVID-19 patients; responses were maintained despite 10-fold dose-reduction in Spike antigen.

    "abstract": "Fungi can rapidly produce large amounts of spores suitable for aerial dispersal. The hydrophobicity of spores is provided by the unique amphiphilic and superior surface-active proteins - hydrophobins (HFBs) - that self-assemble at hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces and thus change surface properties. Using the HFB-enriched mold Trichoderma and the HFB-free yeast Pichia pastoris, we revealed a distinctive HFB secretory pathway that includes an intracellular accumulation of HFBs in lipid bodies (LBs) that can internalize in vacuoles. The resulting vacuolar multicisternal structures (VMS) are stabilized by HFB layers that line up on their surfaces. These HFB-enriched VMSs can move to the periplasm for secretion or become fused in large tonoplast-like organelles. The latter contributes to the maintenance of turgor pressure required for the erection of sporogenic structures and rapid HFB secretion by squeezing out periplasmic VMSs through the cell wall. Thus, HFBs are essential accessory proteins for the development of aerial hyphae and colony architecture.",

However, the functional roles of individual taxa and their contributions to negative health outcomes have yet to be well characterized. Here, we examine two vaginal bacterial taxa grouped within the genus Megasphaera that have been previously associated with bacterial vaginosis (BV) and pregnancy complications. Phylogenetic analyses support the classification of these taxa as two distinct species. These two phylotypes, Megasphaera phylotype 1 (MP1) and Megasphaera phylotype 2 (MP2), differ in genomic structure and metabolic potential, suggestive of differential roles within the vaginal environment. Further, these vaginal taxa show evidence of genome reduction and changes in DNA base composition, which may be common features of host dependence and/or adaptation to the vaginal environment. In a cohort of 3,870 women, we observed that MP1 has a stronger positive association with bacterial vaginosis whereas MP2 was positively associated with trichomoniasis. MP1, in contrast to MP2 and other common BV-associated organisms, was not significantly excluded in pregnancy. In a cohort of 52 pregnant women, MP1 was both present and transcriptionally active in 75.4% of vaginal samples. Conversely, MP2 was largely absent in the pregnant cohort.

Among the citrus growing regions of eastern Himalayas, Wakro in the far eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh is known for its superior quality oranges, popular as the Wakro orange or the Arunachal orange, which has been included in Geographical Indication Registry by the Government of India. However, during last few years, Arunachal orange orchards have been experiencing severe infestation of aphid associated with rapid decline disease, causing catastrophe to the farmers as well as state economy. Therefore, in 2015, an intensive survey of severely affected orange orchards was carried out to investigate the aetiological factors of citrus decline. RNA samples extracted from leaf and aphid specimens collected from Wakro orchards were subjected to CTV detection through 3-UTR specific RT-PCR. Subsequently, ORF1 and CP genetic regions were amplified and clonal-sequencing was performed. Although, BLAST search showed close homology of the present sequences with other virulent genotype VT sequences, detailed phylogenetic analysis demonstrated affinity and clustering of present sequences with VT sequences belonging to the  western lineage. This finding is considerably distinct from CTV sequences reported from citrus growing orchards in India and other neighbouring countries. Additionally, low diversity of CP gene sequences, recombination patterns and presence of sequence segments identical to the present ones in other CTV genotypes was also revealed. Collectively, these observations indicate pristine and primeval nature of present CTV sequences, corroborating well with the proposed origin of CTV in this part of the globe. We here report our finding of western lineage of CTV virulent genotype VT, which is distinct from CTV molecular epidemiology in other parts of India and discuss the implications of these findings.",

A clinically relevant, reproducible model for human burn wound healing is needed to elucidate the early changes in the human burn wound environment. This study reports a reproducible contact burn model on human skin that explores the extent of tissue injury and healing over time, and defines the inter-individual variability in human skin to enable use in mechanistic studies on burn wound progression and healing.\n\nMethodsUsing a customized burn device, contact burns of various depths were created on human skin by two operators and were evaluated for histologic depth by three raters to determine reproducibility. Early burn wound progression and wound healing were also evaluated histologically after the thermally injured human skin was cultured ex vivo for up to 14 days.\n\nResultsBurn depths were reproducibly generated on human skin in a temperature- or time-dependent manner. No significant difference in operator-created or rater-determined depth was observed within each patient sample. However, significant inter-individual variation was identified in burn depth in ten patient samples. Burn-injured ex vivo human skin placed into culture demonstrated differential progression of cell death and collagen denaturation for high and low temperature contact burns, while re-epithelialization was observed in superficial burn wounds over a period of 14 days.\n\nConclusionThis model represents an invaluable tool to evaluate the inter-individual variability in early burn wound progression and wound healing to complement current animal models and enhance the translation of preclinical research to improvements in patient care.",

Our model shows the negative consequences of high temperatures on infection and suggests a temperature-dependent threshold between viral production and degradation. Modeling long-term dynamics in environments with different average temperatures revealed the potential for long-term host-virus coexistence, epidemic free, or habitat loss states. Hence, we generalized our model to global sea surface temperature of present and future seas and show that climate change may influence virus-host dynamics differently depending on the virus-host pair. Our study suggests that temperature-dependent changes in the infectivity of virus particles may lead to shifts in virus-host habitats in warmer oceans, analogous to projected changes in the habitats of macro- and micro-organisms.",

    "abstract": "Ascorbate peroxidases (APx) are class I members of the non-animal peroxidases superfamily, a large group of evolutionarily related enzymes. Through mining in public databases, our group has previously identified two unusual subsets of APx homologs, disclosing the existence of two uncharacterized families of class I peroxidases, which were named ascorbate peroxidase-related (APx-R) and ascorbate peroxidase-like (APx-L). As APx, APx-R proteins possess all catalytic residues required for peroxidase activity. Nevertheless, these proteins do not contain residues known to be critical for ascorbate binding, implying that members of this family must use other substrates while reducing hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, APx-L proteins not only lack ascorbate-binding residues, as do not contain any residue known to be essential for peroxidase activity, in contrast with every other member of the non-animal peroxidase superfamily, which is composed by over 10,000 proteins distributed among bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, and plants. Through a molecular phylogenetic analysis performed with sequences derived from basal Archaeplastida, we now show the existence of hybrid proteins, which combine features of these three families. Analysis performed on public databases show that the prevalence of these proteins varies among distinct groups of organisms, accounting for up to 33% of total APx homologs in species of green algae. The analysis of this heterogeneous group of proteins sheds light on the origin of APx-R and APx-L, through a process characterized by the progressive deterioration of ascorbate-binding sites and catalytic sites towards neofunctionalization.",

    "abstract": "Birds are characterized by evolutionary specializations of both locomotion (e.g., flapping flight) and digestive system (toothless, crop, and gizzard), while the potential selection pressures responsible for these evolutionary specializations remain unclear. Here we used a recently developed molecular phyloecological method to reconstruct the diets of the ancestral archosaur and of the common ancestor of living birds (CALB). Our results showed that the ancestral archosaur exhibited a predominant Darwinian selection of protein and fat digestion and absorption, whereas the CALB showed a marked enhanced selection of carbohydrate and fat digestion and absorption, suggesting a trophic shift from carnivory to herbivory (fruit, seed, and/or nut-eater) at the archosaur-to-bird transition. The evolutionary shift of the CALB to herbivory may have essentially made them become a low-level consumer and, consequently, subject to relatively high predation risk from potential predators such as gliding maniraptorans, from which birds descended. Under the relatively high predation pressure, ancestral birds with gliding capability may have then evolved not only flapping flight as a possible anti-predator strategy against gliding predatory maniraptorans but also the specialized digestive system as an evolutionary tradeoff of maximizing foraging efficiency and minimizing predation risk. Our results suggest that the powered flight and specialized digestive system of birds may have evolved as a result of their tropic shift-associated predation pressure.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe honey bee parasite, Varroa destructor, is a leading cause of honey bee population declines. In addition to being an obligate ectoparasitic mite, Varroa carries several viruses that infect honey bees and act as the proximal cause of colony collapses. Nevertheless, until recently, studies of Varroa have been limited by the paucity of genomic tools. Lab- and field-based methods exploiting such methods are still nascent. This study developed a set of methods for preserving Varroa DNA and RNA from the field to the lab and processing them into sequencing libraries. We performed preservation experiments in which Varroa mites were immersed in TRIzol, RNAlater, and absolute ethanol for preservation periods up to 21 days post-treatment to assess DNA and RNA integrity.\n\nResultsFor both DNA and RNA, mites preserved in TRIzol and RNAlater at room temperature degraded within 10 days post-treatment. Mites preserved in ethanol at room temperature and 4{degrees}C remained intact through 21 days. Varroa mite DNA and RNA libraries were created and sequenced for ethanol preserved samples, 15 and 21 days post-treatment. All DNA sequences mapped to the V. destructor genome at above 95% on average, while RNA sequences mapped to V. destructor, but also sometimes to high levels of the deformed-wing virus and to various organisms.\n\nConclusionEthanolic preservation of field-collected mites is inexpensive and simple, and allows them to be shipped and processed successfully in the lab for a wide variety of sequencing applications. It appears to preserve RNA from both Varroa and at least some of the viruses it vectors.",

    "abstract": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over ten million patients worldwide. Although most coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients have a good prognosis, some develop severe illness. Markers that define disease severity or predict clinical outcome need to be urgently developed as the mortality rate in critical cases is approximately 61.5%. In the present study, we performed indepth proteome profiling of undepleted plasma from eight COVID-19 patients. Quantitative proteomic analysis using the BoxCar method revealed that 91 out of 1,222 quantified proteins were differentially expressed depending on the severity of COVID-19. Importantly, we found 76 proteins, previously not reported, which could be novel prognostic biomarker candidates. Our plasma proteome signatures captured the host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby highlighting the role of neutrophil activation, complement activation, platelet function, and T cell suppression as well as proinflammatory factors upstream and downstream of interleukin-6, interleukin-1B, and tumor necrosis factor. Consequently, this study supports the development of blood biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets to aid clinical decision-making and subsequently improve prognosis of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Exponentially growing systems are prevalent in nature, spanning all scales from biochemical reaction networks in single cells to food webs of ecosystems. How exponential growth emerges in nonlinear systems is mathematically unclear. Here, we describe a general theoretical framework that reveals underlying principles of long-term growth: scalability of flux functions and ergodicity of the rescaled systems. Our theory shows that nonlinear fluxes can generate not only balanced growth, but also oscillatory or chaotic growth modalities, explaining non-equilibrium dynamics observed in cell cycles and ecosystems. Our mathematical framework is broadly useful in predicting long-term growth rates from natural and synthetic networks, analyzing the effects of system noise and perturbations, validating empirical and phenomenological laws on growth rate, and studying autocatalysis and network evolution.\n\nSignificanceNatural systems (e.g., cells, ecosystems) generally consist of reaction networks (e.g., metabolic networks, food webs) with nonlinear flux functions (e.g., Michaelis-Menten kinetics, density-dependent selection). Despite their complex nonlinearities, these systems often exhibit simple exponential growth in the long term. How exponential growth emerges from nonlinear networks remains elusive. Our work demonstrates mathematically how two principles, multivariate scalability of flux functions and ergodicity of the rescaled system, guarantee a well-defined rate of growth. By connecting ergodic theory, a powerful branch of mathematics, to the study of growth in biology, our theoretical framework can recapitulate various growth modalities (from balanced growth to periodic, quasi-periodic or even chaotic behaviors), greatly expanding the types of growing systems that can be studied.",

However, most evidence comes from single-round pseudovirus infection studies of cells that overexpress IFITMs. Here, we verified that artificial overexpression of IFITMs blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection. Strikingly, however, endogenous IFITM expression was essential for efficient infection of genuine SARS-CoV-2 in human lung cells. Our results indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein interacts with IFITMs and hijacks them for efficient viral entry. IFITM proteins were expressed and further induced by interferons in human lung, gut, heart and brain cells. Intriguingly, IFITM-derived peptides and targeting antibodies inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in human lung cells, cardiomyocytes and gut organoids. Our results show that IFITM proteins are important cofactors for SARS-CoV-2 infection of human cell types representing in vivo targets for viral transmission, dissemination and pathogenesis and suitable targets for therapeutic approaches.",

We found that 9 month climate forecasts contributed little skill overall, though some species did benefit from them. The assimilation of observed winter and spring temperature provided the largest improvement of forecast skill throughout the spring. We also found that phenology forecast prediction intervals were most robust when uncertainty was propagated from climate, phenological model, and model parameters as opposed to using climate uncertainty alone.

Moreover, human whey protein inhibited infectious virus production proved by the plaque assay. We found that whey protein from different species such as cow and goat also showed anti-coronavirus properties. And commercial bovine milk also showed similar activity. Interestingly, the main antimicrobial components of breastmilk, such as Lactoferrin and IgA antibody, showed limited anti-coronavirus activity, indicating that other factors of breastmilk may play the important anti-coronavirus role. Taken together, we reported that whey protein inhibits SARS-CoV-2 and its related virus of GX_P2V.

Initial indications of selective advantage of specific mutations can be obtained from calculating their frequencies across viral strains. By applying modelling approaches, we provide additional information that is not evident from standard statistics or mutation frequencies alone. We therefore, propose a more precise way of selecting informative mutations. We highlight two interesting mutations found in genes N (P13L) and ORF3a (Q57H). The former appears to be significantly associated with decreased deaths and cases per million according to our models, while the latter shows an opposing association with decreased deaths and increased cases per million.

    "abstract": "The dire need of effective preventive measures and treatment approaches against SARS-CoV-2 virus, causing COVID-19 pandemic, calls for an in-depth understanding of its evolutionary dynamics with attention to specific geographic locations, since lockdown and social distancing to prevent the virus spread could lead to distinct localized dynamics of virus evolution within and between countries owing to different environmental and host-specific selection pressures. To decipher any correlation between SARS-CoV-2 evolution and its epidemiology in India, we studied the mutational diversity of spike glycoprotein, the key player for the attachment, fusion and entry of virus to the host cell. For this, we analyzed the sequences of 630 Indian isolates as available in GISAID database till June 07, 2020, and detected the spike protein variants to emerge from two major ancestors - Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 and its D614G variant. Average stability of the docked spike protein - host receptor (S-R) complexes for these variants correlated strongly (R2=0.96) with the fatality rates across Indian states. However, while more than half of the variants were found unique to India, 67% of all variants showed lower stability of S-R complex than the respective ancestral variants, indicating a possible fitness loss in recently emerged variants, despite a continuous increase in mutation rate. These results conform to the sharply declining fatality rate countrywide (>7-fold during April 11 - June 28, 2020). Altogether, while we propose the potential of S-R complex stability to track disease severity, we urge an immediate need to explore if SARS-CoV-2 is approaching mutational meltdown in India.\n\nAuthor summaryEpidemiological features are intricately linked to evolutionary diversity of rapidly evolving pathogens, and SARS-CoV-2 is no exception. Our work suggests the potential of average stability of complexes formed by the circulating spike mutational variants and the human host receptor to track the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in a given region. In India, the stability of these complexes for recent variants tend to decrease relative to their ancestral ones, following countrywide declining fatality rate, in contrast to an increasing mutation rate. We hypothesize such a scenario as nascent footprints of Mullers ratchet, proposing large-scale population genomics study for its validation, since this understanding could lead to therapeutic approaches for facilitating mutational meltdown of SARS-CoV-2, as experienced earlier for influenza A virus.",

    "abstract": "The current pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and outbreaks of new variants highlight the need for preventive treatments. Here we identified heparan sulfate proteoglycans as attachment receptors for SARS-CoV-2. Notably, neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 isolated from COVID-19 patients interfered with SARS-CoV-2 binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, which might be an additional mechanism of antibodies to neutralize infection. SARS-CoV-2 binding to and infection of epithelial cells was blocked by low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). Although dendritic cells (DCs) and mucosal Langerhans cells (LCs) were not infected by SARS-CoV-2, both DC subsets efficiently captured SARS-CoV-2 via heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and transmitted the virus to ACE2-positive cells. Moreover, human primary nasal cells were infected by SARS-CoV-2 and infection was blocked by pre-treatment with LMWH. These data strongly suggest that heparan sulfate proteoglycans are important attachment receptors facilitating infection and transmission, and support the use of LMWH as prophylaxis against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Dollar spot, caused by the fungal pathogen Clarireedia spp., is an economically important disease of amenity turfgrass in temperate climates worldwide. This disease often occurs in a highly variable manner, even on a local scale with relatively uniform environmental conditions. The objective of this study was to investigate mechanisms behind this local variation, focusing on contributions of the soil and rhizosphere microbiome. Turfgrass, rhizosphere, and bulk soil samples were taken from within a 256 m2 area of healthy turfgrass, transported to a controlled environment chamber, and inoculated with C. jacksonii. Bacterial communities were profiled targeting the 16s rRNA gene, and 16 different soil chemical properties were assessed. Despite their initial uniform appearance, the samples differentiated into highly susceptible and moderately susceptible groups following inoculation in the controlled environment chamber. The highly susceptible samples harbored a unique rhizosphere microbiome with lower relative abundance of antibiotic-producing bacterial taxa and higher predicted abundance of genes associated with xenobiotic biodegradation pathways. In addition, stepwise regression revealed that bulk soil iron content was the only significant soil characteristic that positively regressed with decreased dollar spot susceptibility during the peak disease development stage. These findings suggest that localized variation in soil iron induces the plant to select for a particular rhizosphere microbiome that alters the disease outcome. More broadly, further research in this area may indicate how plot-scale variability in soil properties can drive variable plant disease development through alterations in the rhizosphere microbiome.\n\nIMPORTANCEDollar spot is the most economically important disease of amenity turfgrass, and more fungicides are applied targeting dollar spot than any other turfgrass disease. Dollar spot symptoms are small (3-5 cm), circular patches that develop in a highly variable manner within plot-scale even under seemingly uniform conditions. The mechanism behind this variable development is unknown. This study observed that differences in dollar spot development over a 256 m2 area were associated with differences in bulk soil iron concentration and correlated with a particular rhizosphere microbiome. These findings provide important clues for understanding the mechanisms behind the highly variable development of dollar spot, which may offer important clues for innovative control strategies. Additionally, these results also suggest that small changes in soil properties can alter plant activity and hence the plant-associated microbial community which has important implications for a broad array of important agricultural and horticultural plant pathosystems.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential protein subunits and translational machinery for four distinct complexes of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Using repurposed whole-exome sequencing data, we demonstrate that pathogenic mtDNA mutations arise in tumors at a rate comparable to the most common cancer driver genes. We identify OXPHOS complexes as critical determinants shaping somatic mtDNA mutation patterns across tumor lineages. Loss-of-function mutations accumulate at an elevated rate specifically in Complex I, and often arise at specific homopolymeric hotspots. In contrast, Complex V is depleted of all non-synonymous mutations, suggesting that mutations directly impacting ATP synthesis are under negative selection. Both common truncating mutations and rarer missense alleles are associated with a pan-lineage transcriptional program, even in cancer types where mtDNA mutations are comparatively rare. Pathogenic mutations of mtDNA are associated with substantial increases in overall survival of colorectal adenocarcinoma patients, demonstrating a clear functional relationship between genotype and phenotype. The mitochondrial genome is therefore frequently and functionally disrupted across many cancers, with significant implications for patient stratification, prognosis and therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Mice deficient in the antioxidant enzyme Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (Sod1-/- or Sod1KO mice) develop spontaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with age. Similar to humans, HCC development in Sod1KO mice progresses from fatty liver disease to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with fibrosis, which eventually progresses to HCC. Because liver inflammation is the main mechanism that drives the disease progression in chronic liver disease (CLD) and because necroptosis is a major source of inflammation, we tested the hypothesis that increased necroptosis in the liver plays a role in increased inflammation and progression to fibrosis and HCC in Sod1KO mice. Phosphorylation of MLKL (P-MLKL), a well-accepted marker of necroptosis, and expression of MLKL protein were significantly increased in the livers of Sod1KO mice compared to WT mice indicating increased necroptosis. Similarly, phosphorylation of RIPK3 and RIPK3 protein levels were also significantly increased. Markers of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages, NLRP3 inflammasome, and transcript levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, e.g., TNF, IL-6, IL-1{beta}, and Ccl2 that are associated with human NASH and HCC, were significantly increased. Markers of fibrosis and oncogenic transcription factor STAT3 were also upregulated in the livers of Sod1KO mice. Short term treatment of Sod1KO mice with necrostatin-1s (Nec-1s), a necroptosis inhibitor, significantly reduced necroptosis, pro-inflammatory cytokines, fibrosis markers and STAT3 activation. Our data show for the first time that necroptosis-mediated inflammation contributes to fibrosis and HCC progression in Sod1KO mice, a mouse model of accelerated aging and progressive HCC development. These findings suggest that necroptosis might be a target for treating NASH and HCC.",

    "abstract": "Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a deadly disease that is rising in prevalence due to population aging. While the disease is complex and poorly understood, one well-documented driver of valvulopathy is serotonin agonism. Both serotonin overexpression, as seen with carcinoid tumors and drug-related agonism, such as with Fenfluramine use, are linked with various diseases of the valves. Thus, the objective of this study was to determine if genetic ablation or pharmacological antagonism of the 5-HT2B serotonin receptor (gene: Htr2b) could improve the hemodynamic and histological progression of calcific aortic valve disease. Htr2b mutant mice were crossed with Notch1+/- mice, an established small animal model of CAVD, to determine if genetic ablation affects CAVD progression. To assess the effect of pharmacological inhibition on CAVD progression, Notch1+/- mice were treated with the 5-HT2B receptor antagonist SB204741. Mice were analyzed using echocardiography, histology, immunofluorescence, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Htr2b mutant mice showed lower aortic valve peak velocity and mean pressure gradient - classical hemodynamic indicators of aortic valve stenosis - without concurrent left ventricle change. 5-HT2B receptor antagonism, however, did not affect hemodynamic progression. Leaflet thickness, collagen density, and CAVD-associated transcriptional markers were not significantly different in any group. This study reveals that genetic ablation of Htr2b attenuates hemodynamic development of CAVD in the Notch1+/- mice, but pharmacological antagonism may require high doses or long-term treatment to slow progression.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly complex in-silico modeling approaches offer a way to simultaneously access cancerous processes at different spatio-temporal scales. High-level models, such as those based on partial differential equations, are computationally affordable and allow large tumor sizes and long temporal windows to be studied, but miss the discrete nature of many key underlying cellular processes. Individual-based approaches provide a much more detailed description of tumors, but have difficulties when trying to handle full-sized real cancers. Thus, there exists a trade-off between the integration of macroscopic and microscopic information, now widely available, and the ability to attain clinical tumor sizes. In this paper we put forward a stochastic mesoscopic simulation framework that incorporates key cellular processes during tumor progression while keeping computational costs to a minimum. Our framework captures a physical scale that allows both the incorporation of microscopic information, tracking the spatio-temporal emergence of tumor heterogeneity and the underlying evolutionary dynamics, and the reconstruction of clinically sized tumors from high-resolution medical imaging data, with the additional benefit of low computational cost. We illustrate the functionality of our modeling approach for the case of glioblastoma, a paradigm of tumor heterogeneity that remains extremely challenging in the clinical setting.\n\nAuthor summaryComputer simulation based on mathematical models provides a way to improve the understanding of complex processes in oncology.

    "abstract": "Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental disorder mostly caused by mutations in the X-linked gene, MeCP2, which encodes for methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2). MeCP2 is member of a family of methyl binding proteins that control the expression of several genes according to the genomic context. Emerging evidence suggests that immune dysfunctions would actively contribute to the pathogenesis of RTT. Macrophages are key effector cells that participate in several critical aspects of immune responses. The aim of our work was to assess the response of macrophages in vitro in the context of polarizing stimuli. We used bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) obtained from MeCP2308/y mice, a mouse model that carries a truncated form of MeCP2. Since MeCP2 is expressed as a \"partially functional\" protein in humans with RTT it becomes crucial to establish how the presence of a mutant form of MeCP2 affects immune responses to support the normal homeostasis of individuals. MeCP2 deficiency induced exacerbation of pro-inflammatory mediators and deficient immune regulatory responses under polarizing conditions. These findings suggest that MeCP2 plays a role in the establishment of macrophage polarization in the context of immune activation. Present results may have important implications in understanding RTT pathogenesis and for developing potential treatments.\n\nConflict of interestThe authors declare no conflicts of interest.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial and parasitic urinary tract infections(UTI) affect many, but our understanding of associated immunity remains poor. Prior work indicates interleukin-22(IL-22) is a key cytokine during infection of other epithelia. We hypothesized IL-22 is crucial during UTI.\n\nIL-22-null(KO) and wild-type(wt) mice underwent bladder wall injection with S. haematobium eggs or transurethral infection with uropathogenic E. coli UTI89.\n\nIL-22 and its soluble binding protein, IL-22BP, were increased in the bladder after S. haematobium egg injection. Genes typically induced by IL-22(CXCL2, REG3G[antimicrobial defense protein]], S100A8, S100A9, and Areg) were expressed at higher levels following S. haematobium egg injection. IL-22 stimulation of bladder tissue induced REG3B expression. IL-22 receptor alpha-1 expression was detectable in the urothelium by immunofluorescence and qPCR.\n\nInjection of S. haematobium eggs into IL-22-KO vs wt mice triggered differential expression of genes related to transferase activity(transferring alkyl or aryl groups) and epithelial cell development. Numerous uroplakin genes were downregulated in egg-injected, IL-22-KO mice versus their wt counterparts. These decreases in uroplakin expression suggest that, as in the gut, IL-22 is important for replenishing the epithelium during infection-related injury.\n\nFollowing transurethral infection with UTI89, IL-22-KO mice had lower bacterial counts in their urine, bladder, and kidneys. Giving stabilized IL-22 cytokine (IL-22-Fc) to UTI89-infected mice led to higher kidney bacterial counts and increased morbidity.\n\nOur data suggest that IL-22 is indeed important in urinary tract immunity, and may interfere with clearance of bacteria from the urinary tract, potentially through its role in maintenance of mature urothelium.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAccurate assessment of the serotype distribution associated with pneumococcal colonization and disease is essential for the evaluation and formulation of pneumococcal vaccines and informing vaccine policy.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated pneumococcal serotyping concordance between latex agglutination, PneumoCaT by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and DNA microarray using samples from community carriage surveillance in Blantyre, Malawi. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, following WHO recommendations, between 2015 and 2017, using stratified random sampling among study populations. Participants included healthy children 3-6 years old (PCV13 vaccinated as part of EPI), healthy children 5-10 years (age-ineligible for PCV13), and HIV-infected adults (18-40yrs) on ART. For phenotypic serotyping we used a 13-valent latex kit (SSI, Denmark). For genomic serotyping we applied PneumoCaT pipeline to whole genome sequence libraries. For molecular serotyping by microarray we used the BUGS Bioscience DNA microarray.\n\nResults1347 samples were analysed. Concordance was 90.7% (95% CI: 89.0-92.2) between latex and PneumoCaT; 95.2% (93.9-96.3) between latex and microarray; and 96.6% (95.5-97.5) between microarray and PneumoCaT. By detecting carried vaccine serotype (VT) pneumococcus in low relative abundance (median 8%), microarray increased VT detection by 31.5% compared to latex serotyping.\n\nConclusionAll three serotyping methods were highly concordant in identifying dominant serotypes. Latex serotyping is accurate in identifying vaccine-serotypes and requires the least expertise and resources for field-implementation and analysis. However, WGS, which adds population structure, and microarray, which adds multiple-serotype carriage, should be considered at regional reference laboratories while investigating the importance of VT in low relative abundance in transmission and disease.",

    "abstract": "Copper is an essential element for biological systems but becomes toxic when present in excess. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important human pathogen, the resistance to copper requires the induction of dsbDEG operon encoding proteins involved in disulfide-bond formation (Dsb). However, it is unknown how the copper stress induces the transcription of the operon. Here, we report that the exogenous copper induces the transcription of the dsbDEG operon through a new copper-sensing two-component system named DsbRS. The dsbRS is divergently transcribed from the dsbDEG operon, and the response regulator DsbR binds to the intergenic region between the operons. In the absence of copper, the sensor kinase DsbS acts as a phosphatase toward DsbR and thus blocks the transcription of the operons. However, in the presence of copper, the metal ion directly binds to the sensor domain of DsbS, for which the Cys82 residue plays a critical role. The copper-binding appears to inhibit the phosphatase activity of DsbS, leading to activation of DsbR. The copper resistance of the dsbRS knock-out mutant was restored by ectopic expression of the dsbDEG operon, confirming the critical role of the operon in the resistance to copper. Strikingly, cognates of dsbRS-dsbDEG pair are widely distributed across eubacteria. Also, a DsbR-binding site, which contains the consensus sequence 5-TAA-N7-TTAAT-3, is detected in the promoter region of dsbDEG homologs in those species. Thus, regulation of Dsb genes by DsbRS represents a novel mechanism by which bacterial cells cope with copper stress.\n\nImportanceCopper is an essential redox active cofactor that becomes highly cytotoxic when present in excess. Therefore, in order to evade copper toxicity, bacteria must perceive copper stress and tightly regulate genes expression. In the present study, we identify a new copper-sensing two-component system (designated DsbRS) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important human pathogen. We provide multiple lines of evidence that upon copper binding to the periplasmic domain of DsbS, its phosphatase activity is blocked, and the phosphorylated DsbR directly activates the transcription of a number of copper-induced genes including those involved in protein disulfide-bond formation (Dsb). This study suggests that regulation of Dsb genes by DsbRS may be an underappreciated regulatory mechanism by which bacteria sense and respond to copper.",

Moreover, CSNK1G2 is also co-expressed with RIP3 in human testis, and the necroptosis activation marker phospho-MLKL was observed in the testis of old (>80) but not young men, indicating that the testis-aging program carried out by the RIP3-mediated and CSNK1G2-attenuated necroptosis is evolutionarily conserved between mice and men.",

    "abstract": "Across the [~]30,000 species of ray-finned fish, fins show incredible diversity in overall shape and in the patterning of the supportive bony rays. Fin length mutant zebrafish have provided critical insights into the developmental pathways that regulate relative fin size. However, the processes that govern skeletal patterning along the proximodistal axis of the fin have remained less well understood. Here, we show that thyroid hormone regulates proximodistal identity of fin rays, distalizing gene expression profiles, morphogenetic processes during outgrowth, and ultimate morphology of the fin. This role for thyroid hormone in specifying proximodistal identity appears conserved between development and regeneration, in all the fins, and between species. We demonstrate that proximodistal identity is regulated independently from pathways that determine size, and we show that modulating proximodistal patterning relative to growth can recapitulate the spectrum of fin ray diversity found in nature.",

    "abstract": "AbstractsBacterial bloodstream infections (BSI) are a major health concern and can cause up to 40% mortality. Pseudomonas aeruginosa BSI is often of nosocomial origin and is associated with a particularly poor prognosis. The mechanism of bacterial persistence in blood is still largely unknown. Here, we analyzed the behavior of a cohort of clinical and laboratory Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains in human blood. In this specific environment, complement was the main defensive mechanism, acting either by direct bacterial lysis or by opsonophagocytosis, which required recognition by immune cells. We found highly variable survival rates for different strains in blood, whatever their origin, serotype, or the nature of their secreted toxins and despite their detection by immune cells. We identified and characterized a complement-tolerant subpopulation of bacterial cells that we named \"evaders\". Evaders represented 0.1-0.001% of the initial bacterial load and displayed transient tolerance. Although evaders shared some features with bacterial persisters, which tolerate antibiotic treatment, they appear to have evolved distinct strategies to escape complement. We detected the evaders for five other major human pathogens: Acinetobacter baumannii, Burkholderia multivorans, enteroaggregative Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Thus, the evaders could allow the pathogen to persist within the bloodstream, and may be the cause of fatal bacteremia or dissemination, notably in the absence of effective antibiotic treatments.\n\nAuthor summary for \"Complement evaders\"Blood infections by antibiotic resistant bacteria, notably Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are major concerns in hospital settings. The complex interplay between P. aeruginosa and the innate immune system in the context of human blood is still poorly understood. By studying the behavior of various P. aeruginosa strains in human whole blood and plasma, we showed that bacterial strains display different rate of tolerance to the complement system. Despite the complement microbicide activity, most bacteria withstand elimination through phenotypic heterogeneity creating a tiny (<0.1%) subpopulation of transiently tolerant evaders. While genetically identical to the rest of the complement-sensitive population, evaders allow the bacteria to persist in plasma. This phenotypic heterogeneity thus prevents total elimination of the pathogen from the circulation, and represent a new strategy to disseminate within the organism.",
