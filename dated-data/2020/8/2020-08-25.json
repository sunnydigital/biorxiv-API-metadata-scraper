    "abstract": "BackgroundThe increasing statistical power of genome-wide association studies is fostering the development of precision medicine through genomic predictions of complex traits. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the results remain relatively modest. A reason might be the nature of the methods typically used to construct genomic predictions. Recent machine learning techniques have properties that could help to capture the architecture of complex traits better and improve genomic prediction accuracy.\n\nMethodsWe relied on crowd-sourcing to efficiently compare multiple genomic prediction methods. This represents an innovative approach in the genomic field because of the privacy concerns linked to human genetic data. There are two crowd-sourcing elements building our study. First, we constructed a dataset from openSNP (opensnp.org), an open repository where people voluntarily share their genotyping data and phenotypic information in an effort to participate in open science. To leverage this resource we release the  openSNP Cohort Maker, a tool that builds a homogeneous and up-to-date cohort based on the data available on opensnp.org. Second, we organized an open online challenge on the CrowdAI platform (crowdai.org) aiming at predicting height from genome-wide genotyping data.\n\nResultsThe  openSNP Height Prediction challenge lasted for three months. A total of 138 challengers contributed to 1275 submissions. The winner computed a polygenic risk score using the publicly available summary statistics of the GIANT study to achieve the best result (r2 = 0.53 versus r2 = 0.49 for the second-best).\n\nConclusionWe report here the first crowd-sourced challenge on publicly available genome-wide genotyping data. We also deliver the  openSNP Cohort Maker that will allow people to make use of the data available on opensnp.org.",

    "abstract": "The P4 ATPases are a large family of membrane-embedded enzymes that use ATP hydrolysis to transport large lipid substrates across lipid bilayers. P4 ATPases differ in their cellular membrane location and their substrates. The structures of the endosome- and Golgi-localized class-1 phosphatidylserine flippases--such as the yeast Drs2 and human ATP8A1--have recently been reported, revealing a substrate binding site on the lumenal side and several transport states. However, a substrate binding site on the cytosolic side has not been found, and the transport mechanisms of P4 ATPases in other classes are still unknown. Here we report a systematic structural and functional study on two plasma-membrane localized, class-3 P4 ATPases that have broader substrate specificity, the S. cerevisiae Dnf1-Lem3 and Dnf2-Lem3 complexes. We have captured substrate lipids on both the exoplasmic and cytosolic sides, and we found that these two enzymes have very similar structures, consistent with their high sequence identity and redundant function. Unexpectedly, Lem3 contributes to substrate binding near the cytosolic surface. We found that the conformational transitions through the substrate transport cycle of these two class-3 enzymes match those of the class-1 enzymes, suggesting a conserved lipid-flipping mechanism among all classes of the P4 ATPases. Our study also revealed a helix-turn-helix insertion in the cytosolic P domain that is unique to the class-3 enzymes and plays a crucial role in their function. Therefore, the P4 ATPases may have retained an overall transport mechanism while evolving distinct features for cellular membrane localization, regulatory mechanisms, and transporting different lipid substrates.",

    "abstract": "Bulk transcriptomic studies have defined classical and basal-like gene expression subtypes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that correlate with survival and response to chemotherapy; however, the underlying mechanisms that govern these subtypes and their heterogeneity remain elusive. Here, we performed single-cell RNA-sequencing of 23 metastatic PDAC needle biopsies and matched organoid models to understand how tumor cell-intrinsic features and extrinsic factors in the tumor microenvironment (TME) shape PDAC cancer cell phenotypes. We identify a novel cancer cell state that co-expresses basal-like and classical signatures, demonstrates upregulation of developmental and KRAS-driven gene expression programs, and represents a transitional intermediate between the basal-like and classical poles. Further, we observe structure to the metastatic TME supporting a model whereby reciprocal intercellular signaling shapes the local microenvironment and influences cancer cell transcriptional subtypes. In organoid culture, we find that transcriptional phenotypes are plastic and strongly skew toward the classical expression state, irrespective of genotype. Moreover, we show that patient-relevant transcriptional heterogeneity can be rescued by supplementing organoid media with factors found in the TME in a subtype-specific manner. Collectively, our study demonstrates that distinct microenvironmental signals are critical regulators of clinically relevant PDAC transcriptional states and their plasticity, identifies the necessity for considering the TME in cancer modeling efforts, and provides a generalizable approach for delineating the cell-intrinsic versus -extrinsic factors that govern tumor cell phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the primary receptor to enter host cells and initiate the infection. The critical binding region of ACE2 is a [~]30 aa long helix. Here we report the design of four stapled peptides based on the ACE2 helix, which is expected to bind to SARS-CoV-2 and prevent the binding of the virus to the ACE2 receptor and disrupt the infection. All stapled peptides showed high helical contents (50-94% helicity). On the contrary, the linear control peptide NYBSP-C showed no helicity (19%). We have evaluated the peptides in a pseudovirus based single-cycle assay in HT1080/ACE2 and human lung cells A549/ACE2, overexpressing ACE2. Three of the four stapled peptides showed potent antiviral activity in HT1080/ACE2 (IC50: 1.9 - 4.1 {micro}M) and A549/ACE2 cells (IC50: 2.2 - 2.8 {micro}M). The linear peptides NYBSP-C and the double-stapled peptide StRIP16, used as controls, showed no antiviral activity. Most significantly, none of the stapled peptides show any cytotoxicity at the highest dose tested. We also evaluated the antiviral activity of the peptides by infecting Vero E6 cells with the replication-competent authentic SARS-CoV-2 (US_WA-1/2020). NYBSP-1 was the most efficient preventing the complete formation of cytopathic effects (CPEs) at an IC100 17.2 {micro}M. NYBSP-2 and NYBSP-4 also prevented the formation of the virus-induced CPE with an IC100 of about 33 {micro}M.

    "abstract": "Muscles consume metabolic energy for active movement, particularly when performing mechanical work or producing force. Less appreciated is the cost for activating and deactivating muscle quickly, which adds considerably to the overall cost of cyclic force production (Chasiotis et al., 1987). But the cost relative to mechanical work, which features in many movements, is unknown. We therefore tested whether fast activation-deactivation is costly compared to performing work or producing isometric force. We hypothesized that metabolic cost would increase with a proposed measure termed force-rate (rate of increase in muscle force) in cyclic tasks, separate from mechanical work or average force level. We tested humans (N = 9) producing cyclic knee extension torque against an isometric dynamometer (torque 22 N-m, cyclic waveform frequencies 0.5 - 2.5 Hz), while also quantifying the force and work of muscle fascicles against series elasticity (with ultrasonography), along with metabolic rate through respirometry. Net metabolic rate increased by more than fourfold (10.5 to 46.7 W) with waveform frequency. At high frequencies, the hypothesized force-rate cost accounted for nearly half (41%) of energy expenditure. This exceeded the cost for average force (17%) and was comparable to the cost for shortening work (42%). The energetic cost is explained by a simple first-order model of rate-limiting steps in muscle contraction, primarily crossbridge dynamics. The force-rate cost could contribute substantially to the overall cost of movements that require cyclic muscle activation, such as locomotion.\n\nSummary statementThe energetic cost of isometric muscle force production during cyclic muscle contraction increases sharply with cycle frequency and in proportion to the rate of force development",

However, the origin and mechanisms underlying the degeneration are not well described in human skeletal muscle. Here we show that skeletal muscles of T2DM patients exhibit pathological degenerative remodeling of the extracellular matrix that was associated with a selective increase of a subpopulation of fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs) marked by expression of THY1 (CD90) - the FAPCD90+. We identified Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling as key regulator of human FAP biology, as it promotes proliferation and collagen production at the expense of adipogenesis, an effect accompanied with a metabolic shift towards glycolytic lactate fermentation. FAPsCD90+ showed a PDGF-mimetic phenotype, with high proliferative activity and clonogenicity, increased production of extracellular matrix production and enhanced glycolysis. Importantly, the pathogenic phenotype of T2DM FAPCD90+ was reduced by treatment with the anti-diabetic drug Metformin. These data identify PDGF-driven conversion of a sub-population of FAPs as a key event in the pathogenic accumulation of extracellular matrix in T2DM muscles.",

    "abstract": "Visualizing the 4D genome in live cells is essential for understanding its regulation. Programmable DNA-binding probes, such as fluorescent clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and transcription activator-like effector (TALE) proteins have recently emerged as powerful tools for imaging specific genomic loci in live cells. However, many such systems rely on genetically-encoded components, often requiring multiple constructs that each must be separately optimized, thus limiting their use. Here we develop efficient and versatile systems, based on in vitro transcribed single-guide-RNAs (sgRNAs) and fluorescently-tagged recombinant, catalytically-inactivated Cas9 (dCas9) proteins. Controlled cell delivery of pre-assembled dCas9-sgRNA ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes enables robust genomic imaging in live cells and in early mouse embryos. We further demonstrate multiplex tagging of up to 3 genes, tracking detailed movements of chromatin segments and imaging spatial relationships between a distal enhancer and a target gene, with nanometer resolution in live cells. This simple and effective approach should facilitate visualizing chromatin dynamics and nuclear architecture in various living systems.",

    "abstract": "Culture medium is frequently modelled as water in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of in vitro culture systems involving flow, such as bioreactors and organ-on-chips. However, culture medium can be expected to have different properties to water due to its higher solute content. Furthermore, cellular activities such as metabolism and secretion of ECM proteins alter the composition of culture medium and therefore its properties during culture. As these properties directly determine the hydromechanical stimuli exerted on cells in vitro, these, along with any changes during culture must be known for CFD modelling accuracy and meaningful interpretation of cellular responses. In this study, the density and dynamic viscosity of DMEM and RPMI-1640 media supplemented with typical concentrations of foetal bovine serum (0, 5, 10 and 20% v/v) were measured to serve as a reference for computational design analysis. Any changes in the properties of medium during culture were also investigated with NCI-H460 and HN6 cell lines. The density and dynamic viscosity of the media increased proportional to the % volume of added foetal bovine serum (FBS). Importantly, the viscosity of 5% FBS-supplemented RPMI-1640 was found to increase significantly after 3 days of culture of NCI-H460 and HN6 cell lines, with distinct differences between magnitude of change for each cell line. Finally, these experimentally-derived values were applied in CFD analysis of a simple microfluidic device, which demonstrated clear differences in maximum wall shear stress and pressure between fluid models. Overall, these results highlight the importance of characterizing model-specific properties for CFD design analysis of cell culture systems.",

    "abstract": "The development and subsequent rupture of atherosclerotic plaques in human carotid arteries is a major cause of ischemic stroke. Mechanical characterization of atherosclerotic plaques can aid our understanding of this rupture risk. Despite this however, experimental studies on human atherosclerotic carotid plaques, and fibrous plaque caps in particular, are very limited. This study aims to provide further insights into atherosclerotic plaque rupture by mechanically testing human fibrous plaque caps, the region of the atherosclerotic lesion most often attributed the highest risk of rupture. The results obtained highlight the variability in the ultimate tensile stress, strain and stiffness experienced in atherosclerotic plaque caps. By pre-screening all samples using small angle light scattering (SALS) to determine the dominant fibre direction in the tissue, along with supporting histological analysis, this work suggests that the collagen fibre alignment in the circumferential direction plays the most dominant role for determining plaque structural stability. The work presented in this study could provide the basis for new diagnostic approaches to be developed, which non-invasively identify carotid plaques at greatest risk of rupture.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=95 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/264457v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@185109forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1067820org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b8baf3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f9b3af_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Vascularization of engineered scaffolds remains a critical obstacle hindering the translation of tissue engineering from the bench to the clinic. Previously, we demonstrated the robust micro-vascularization of collagen hydrogels with induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived endothelial progenitors; however, physically cross-linked collagen hydrogels compact rapidly and exhibit limited strength. To address these challenges, we synthesized an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogel comprised of collagen and norbornene-modified hyaluronic acid (NorHA). This dual-network hydrogel combines the natural cues presented by collagens binding sites and extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking fibrous architecture with the in situ modularity and chemical cross-linking of NorHA. We modulated the stiffness and degradability of this novel IPN hydrogel by varying the concentration and sequence, respectively, of the NorHA peptide cross-linker. Rheological characterization of the photo-mediated gelation process revealed that the stiffness of the IPN hydrogel increased with cross-linker concentration and was decoupled from the bulk NorHA content. Conversely, the swelling of the IPN hydrogel decreased linearly with increasing cross-linker concentration. Collagen microarchitecture remained relatively unchanged across cross-linking conditions, although the mere addition of NorHA delayed collagen fibrillogenesis. Upon iPSC-derived endothelial progenitor encapsulation, robust, lumenized microvascular networks developed in IPN hydrogels over two weeks. Subsequent computational analysis showed that an initial rise in stiffness increased the number of branch points and vessels, but vascular growth was suppressed in high stiffness IPN hydrogels. These results suggest that an IPN hydrogel consisting of collagen and NorHA is highly tunable, compaction resistant, and capable of stimulating angiogenesis.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe have synthesized the first tunable collagen and norbornene functionalized hyaluronic acid (NorHA) interpenetrating polymer network hydrogel. This unique biomaterial allows for control over hydrogel stiffness, independent of the total polymer concentration, by varying the concentration of a peptide cross-linker and was specifically designed to produce a biomimetic vasculogenic microenvironment. Using the system, we performed a detailed study of the vasculogenesis of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (iPSC) endothelial progenitors, a poorly studied cell source with considerable therapeutic potential. Our results show that vascular growth can be tuned by altering the stiffness and degradability of the scaffolds independently. Finally, we improved upon our open-source computational pipeline programmed in ImageJ and MATLAB to further quantify vascular topologies in three dimensions.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=68 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/259630v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d3ee04org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@af739aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cec470org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c2ae18_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has devastated the globe as a pandemic that has killed more than 1,600,000 people. Widespread vaccination is still uncertain, so many scientific efforts have been directed toward discovering antiviral treatments. Many drugs are being investigated to inhibit the coronavirus main protease, 3CLpro, from cleaving its viral polyprotein, but few publications have addressed this proteases interactions with the host proteome or their probable contribution to virulence. Too few host protein cleavages have been experimentally verified to fully understand 3CLpros global effects on relevant cellular pathways and tissues. Here, I set out to determine this proteases targets and corresponding potential drug targets. Using a neural network trained on cleavages from 388 coronavirus proteomes with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.983, I predict that a large proportion of the human proteome is vulnerable to 3CLpro, with 4,460 out of approximately 20,000 human proteins containing at least one putative cleavage site. These cleavages are nonrandomly distributed and are enriched in the epithelium along the respiratory tract, brain, testis, plasma, and immune tissues and depleted in olfactory and gustatory receptors despite the prevalence of anosmia and ageusia in COVID-19 patients. Affected cellular pathways include cytoskeleton/motor/cell adhesion proteins, nuclear condensation and other epigenetics, host transcription and RNAi, ribosomal stoichiometry and nascent-chain detection and degradation, coagulation, pattern recognition receptors, growth factors, lipoproteins, redox, ubiquitination, and apoptosis. This whole proteome cleavage prediction demonstrates the importance of 3CLpro in expected and nontrivial pathways affecting virulence, lead me to propose more than a dozen potential therapeutic targets against coronaviruses, and should therefore be applied to all viral proteases and subsequently experimentally verified.",

    "abstract": "Durable control of invasive solid tumors necessitates identifying therapeutic resistance mechanisms and effective drug combinations. A promising approach to tackle the cancer drug resistance problem is to build mechanistic mathematical models of the signaling network of cancer cells, and explicitly model the dynamics of information flow through this network under distinct genetic conditions and in response to perturbations.\n\nIn this work, we used a network-based mathematical model to identify sensitivity factors and drug combinations for the PI3K inhibitor alpelisib, which was recently approved for ER+ PIK3CA mutant breast cancer. We experimentally validated the model-predicted efficacious combination of alpelisib and BH3 mimetics (e.g. MCL1 inhibitors) in ER+ breast cancer cell lines. We also experimentally validated the reduced sensitivity to alpelisib caused by FOXO3 knockdown, which is a novel potential resistance mechanism. Our experimental results showed cell line-specific sensitivity to the combination of alpelisib and BH3 mimetics, which was driven by the choice of BH3 mimetics. We find that cell lines were sensitive to the addition of either MCL1 inhibitor s63845 alone or in combination with BCL-XL/BCL-2 inhibitor navitoclax, and that the need for the combination of both BH3 mimetics was predicted by the expression of BCL-XL. Based on these results, we developed cell line-specific network models that are able to recapitulate the observed differential response to alpelisib and BH3 mimetics, and also incorporate the most recent knowledge on resistance and response to PI3K inhibitors.\n\nOverall, we present an approach for the development, experimental testing, and refining of mathematical models, which we apply to the context of PI3K inhibitor drug resistance in breast cancer. Our approach predicted and validated PI3K inhibitor sensitivity factors (FOXO3 knockdown) and drug combinations (BH3 mimetics), and illustrates that network-based mathematical models can contribute to overcoming the challenge of cancer drug resistance.",

Allele-specific antigen presentation (AP) has been widely proposed as a culprit mechanism; however, direct evidence to substantiate that hypothesis is scant. Here we demonstrate AP-independent differential macrophage activation by HLA-DRB1 alleles known to associate with autoimmune disease risk or protection with resultant polarization of pro-inflammatory (\"M1\") versus anti-inflammatory (\"M2\") macrophages, respectively. RNA-sequencing analyses of in vitro-polarized macrophages in the presence of AP-incompetent short synthetic peptides corresponding to the third allelic hypervariable regions coded by those two HLA-DRB1 alleles showed reciprocal activation of pro- versus anti-inflammatory transcriptomes, with implication of corresponding gene ontologies and upstream regulators. These results identify a previously unrecognized mechanism of differential immune modulation by short HLA-DRB1-coded allelic epitopes independent of AP, and could shed new light on the mechanistic basis of HLA-disease association.",

Here we focus on the consumer dependence of functional responses to evidence systematic bias in the statistical comparison of functional-response models and the estimation of their parameters. Both forms of bias are universal to nonlinear models (irrespective of consumer dependence) and are rooted in a lack of sufficient replication. Using a large compilation of published datasets, we show that - due to the prevalence of low sample size studies - neither the overall frequency by which alternative models achieve top rank nor the frequency distribution of parameter point estimates should be treated as providing insight into the general form or central tendency of consumer interference. We call for renewed clarity in the varied purposes that motivate the study of functional responses, purposes that can compete with each other in dictating the design, analysis, and interpretation of functional-response experiments.",

Despite their broad relevance and long-standing history, we show here that the types of density dependence found in classic resource- and consumer-dependent functional-response models equate to strong and often untenable assumptions about the independence of processes underlying feeding rates. We first demonstrate mathematically how to quantify non-independence between feeding and consumer interference and between feeding on multiple resources. We then analyze two large collections of functional-response datasets to show that non-independence is pervasive and borne out in previously-hidden forms of density dependence. Our results provide a new lens through which to view variation in consumer feeding rates and disentangle the biological underpinnings of species interactions in multi-species contexts.",

With stimulation with Her2-NLPs, we observed uptake of Her2 protein and a decreased probability of individual non-malignant cells forming polar growth arrested acinar-like structures. The NLP delivery system alone or Her2-NLPs plus trastuzumab showed no effect on acinar organization rate. Transcriptomics revealed essentially no effect of empty NLPs versus untreated cells whereas Her2-NLPs versus either untreated or empty NLP treated cells revealed upregulation of several factors associated with breast cancer. Pathway analysis also suggested that known nodes downstream of Her2 were activated in response to Her2-NLP treatment.

This allows us to generate an accurate model of the active Arp2/3 complex in the branch junction and its interaction with actin filaments. Our structure indicates a central role for the ArpC3 subunit in stabilizing the active conformation and suggests that in the branch junction relocation of the ArpC5 N-terminus and the C-terminal tail of Arp3 is important to fix Arp2 and Arp3 in an actin dimer-like conformation. Notably, our model of the branch junction in cells significantly differs from the previous in vitro branch junction model.",

Human pressures have the potential to negatively impact species and undermine their conservation, but their overlap with sensitive threatened species in PAs remains rarely quantified. Here, we analyse the co-occurrence of nineteen threatening human activities within the distributions of 146 threatened terrestrial vertebrates in the European Union (EU), accounting for species-specific sensitivities to each pressure and thereby mapping potential human impacts on species within EU PAs. We find that human pressures extend across > 1.022 million km2 (94.5%) of EU protected land, with potential negative impacts on threatened species across 1.015 million km2 (93.8%). A total of 122 out of 146 species (84%) have > 50% of their EU protected ranges potentially impacted, and 83 out of 146 species (57%) more than 90% of their protected range. More species have a smaller proportion of their protected range potentially impacted in Natura2000 sites than in non-Natura2000 sites, and the same is true for species in nature reserves and wilderness areas compared to less strictly managed PAs. Our results show that threatened species in Europes PAs are exposed to immense human pressures, and suggest that areas designated for species conservation are ineffective for halting biodiversity decline.

    "abstract": "Since the inception of the molecular clock model for sequence evolution, the investigation of protein divergence has revolved around the question of a more or less constant rate of overall sequence information change. Although anomalies in clock-like divergence are described for some proteins, nowadays, the assumption of a constant decay rate for a given protein family is taken as the null model for protein evolution. Still, so far, a systematic test of this null model has not been done at a genome-wide scale despite the databases enormous growth. We focus here on divergence rate comparisons between closely related lineages, since this allows clear orthology assignments by synteny and unequivocal alignments, which are crucial for the determination of substitution rate changes. Thus, we generated a high-confidence dataset of syntenic orthologs from four ape species, including humans. Further analysis revealed that despite the appearance of an overall clock-like substitution pattern, a substantial number of proteins show lineage-specific acceleration and deceleration in divergence rates, or combinations of both in different lineages. Interestingly, when aggregated, even the families showing large lineage-specific rate perturbations can show overall rate equality. Our analysis uncovers a much more dynamic history of substitution rate changes in protein families. Which invalidates a pan-genome null model of constant decay, on the one hand, but remains compatible with the existing notion that aggregated data can be reliably used to estimate species splitting time. Ultimately, our data shows that a null model of constant change is not suitable to predict the evolutionary trajectories of individual proteins.",

    "abstract": "HMGB1 is a key molecule that both triggers and sustains inflammation following infection or injury, and is involved in a large number of pathologies, including cancer. HMGB1 participates to the recruitment of inflammatory cells forming a heterocomplex with the chemokine CXCL12 (HMGB1*CXCL12), herewith activating the G-protein coupled receptor CXCR4. Thus, identification of molecules that disrupt this heterocomplex can offer novel pharmacological opportunities to treat inflammation related diseases. To identify new HMGB1*CXCL12 inhibitors we have performed a study on the ligandability of the single HMG boxes of HMGB1 followed by a virtual screening campaign on both HMG boxes using Zbc Drugs and three different docking programs (Glide, AutoDock Vina, AutoDock 4.2.6). The best poses in terms of scoring functions, visual inspection and predicted ADME properties were further filtered according to a pharmacophore model based on known HMGB1 binders and clustered according to their structures. Eight compounds representative of the clusters were tested for HMGB1 binding by NMR. We identified 5,5-methylenedi-2,3-cresotic acid (2a) as binder of both HMGB1 and CXCL12; 2a also targets the HMGB1*CXCL12 heterocomplex. In cell migration assays 2a inhibited the chemotactic activity of HMGB1*CXCL12 with IC50 in the subnanomolar range, the best documented up to now. These results pave the way for future structure activity relationship studies to optimize the pharmacological targeting of HMGB1*CXCL12 for anti-inflammatory purposes.",

In India, more than 3 million confirmed cases have been reported although with relatively low death rate of 1.8%. In this study, we sequenced 47 genomes of SARS-CoV-2 from the patients of 13 districts of Uttar Pradesh (UP), the largest state of India using third-generation sequencing technique. The phylogenetic clustering revealed that no UP sample was aligned with the previously defined USA clade, where the mortality was high. We identified 56 distinct SNP variations in the genomes of UP resulting in a unique mutation rate of 1.19% per sequence, which is greater than the value 0.88% obtained for the rest of India. The relatively less death rate in UP indicates that the mutation in the virus is deleterious. Further investigation is required with larger sample size to determine the degree of virulence vis-a-vis SNP variation.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is an important technique that adds another dimension to the intensity and colour information of conventional microscopy. In particular, it allows for multiplexing fluorescent labels that have otherwise similar spectral properties. Currently, the only super-resolution technique that is capable of recording super-resolved images with lifetime information is STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy. In contrast, all Single-Molecule Localisation Microscopy (SMLM) techniques that employ wide-field cameras completely lack the lifetime dimension. Here, we combine Fluorescence-Lifetime Confocal Laser-Scanning Microscopy (FL-CLSM) with SMLM for realising single-molecule localisation-based fluorescence-lifetime super-resolution imaging (FL-SMLM). Besides yielding images with a spatial resolution much beyond the diffraction limit, it determines the fluorescence lifetime of all localised molecules. We validate our technique by applying it to direct STochastic Optical Reconstruction Microscopy (dSTORM) and Points Accumulation for Imaging in Nanoscale Topography (PAINT) imaging of fixed cells, and we demonstrate its multiplexing capability on samples with two different labels that differ only by fluorescence lifetime but not by their spectral properties.",

However, how molecular alterations in tumours differ among patients of different age remains largely unexplored. Here, using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas, we comprehensively characterised genomic, transcriptomic and epigenetic alterations in relation to patients age across cancer types. We showed that tumours from older patients present an overall increase in genomic instability, somatic copy-number alterations (SCNAs) and somatic mutations. Age-associated SCNAs and mutations were identified in several cancer-driver genes across different cancer types. The largest age-related genomic differences were found in gliomas and endometrial cancer. We identified age-related global transcriptomic changes and demonstrated that these genes are controlled by age-associated DNA methylation changes. This study provides a comprehensive view of age-associated alterations in cancer and underscores age as an important factor to consider in cancer research and clinical practice.",

However, whether this memory advantage persists over years and which neural systems underlie such an effect remains unknown. Here, we investigated recognition of incidentally encoded faces with angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral expressions over >1.5 years (N= 89). Univariate analyses showed that threatening faces (angry, fearful) were better recognized than happy and neutral faces after >1.5 years, and that the threat-related memory enhancement was driven by forgetting of non-threatening faces. Multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) confirmed the discriminative performance between threatening and non-threatening faces. With an innovative Behavioral Pattern Similarity Analysis (BPSA) approach and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisition during encoding, we further found that the long-term memory advantage for threatening faces were underpinned by differential neural encoding in the left inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) and right ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex (vmPFC/OFC). Our study provides the first evidence that threatening facial expressions lead to persistent face recognition over periods of >1.5 years and differential encoding-related activity in the visual cortex and medial prefrontal cortex may underlie this effect.",

    "abstract": "The functional properties of cerebellar stellate cells and the way they regulate molecular layer activity are still unclear. We have measured stellate cells electroresponsiveness and their activation by parallel fiber bursts. Stellate cells showed intrinsic pacemaking, along with characteristic responses to depolarization and hyperpolarization, and showed a marked short-term facilitation during repetitive parallel fiber transmission. Spikes were emitted after a lag and only at high frequency, making stellate cells to operate as delay-high-pass filters. A detailed computational model summarizing these physiological properties allowed to explore different functional configurations of the parallel fiber - stellate cell - Purkinje cell circuit. Simulations showed that, following parallel fiber stimulation, Purkinje cells almost linearly increased their response with input frequency but such an increase was inhibited by stellate cells, which leveled the Purkinje cell gain curve to its 4 Hz value. When reciprocal inhibitory connections between stellate cells were activated, the control of stellate cells over Purkinje cell discharge was maintained only at very high frequencies. These simulations thus predict a new role for stellate cells, which could endow the molecular layer with low-pass and band-pass filtering properties regulating Purkinje cell gain and, along with this, also burst delay and the burst-pause responses pattern.",

    "abstract": "The global spread of SARS-CoV-2 is posing major public health challenges. One unique feature of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein is the insertion of multi-basic residues at the S1/S2 subunit cleavage site, the function of which remains uncertain. We found that the virus with intact spike (Sfull) preferentially enters cells via fusion at the plasma membrane, whereas a clone (Sdel) with deletion disrupting the multi-basic S1/S2 site instead utilizes a less efficient endosomal entry pathway. This idea was supported by the identification of a suite of endosomal entry factors specific to Sdel virus by a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen. A panel of host factors regulating the surface expression of ACE2 was identified for both viruses. Using a hamster model, animal-to-animal transmission with the Sdel virus was almost completely abrogated, unlike with Sfull. These findings highlight the critical role of the S1/S2 boundary of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in modulating virus entry and transmission.",

    "abstract": "The newly identified pathogenic human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, led to an atypical pneumonia-like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently, nearly 23 million cases have been confirmed worldwide with the highest COVID-19 cases been confirmed in the United States. As there is no vaccine or any effective interventions, massive efforts to create a postential vaccine to combat COVID-19 is underway. In the meantime, safety precautions and effective disease control strategies appear to be vital for preventing the virus spread in the public places. Due to the longevity of the virus on smooth surfaces, photocatalytic properties of self-disinfecting/cleaning surfaces appear to be a promising tool to help guide disinfection policies to control infectious SAR-CoV-2 spread in high-traffic areas such as hospitals, grocery stores, airports, schools, and stadiums. Here, we explored the photocatalytic properties of nanosized TiO2 (TNPs) as induced by the UV radiation, towards virus deactivation. Our preliminary results using close genetic relative of SAR-CoV-2, HCoV-NL63, showed the virucidal efficacy of photoactive TNPs deposited on glass coverslips, as examined by quantitative RT-PCR and virus culture assays. Efforts to extrapolate the underlying concepts described in this study to SARS-CoV-2 are currently underway.",

    "abstract": "Gardnerella spp. are considered a hallmark of bacterial vaginosis, a dysbiosis of the vaginal microbiome. There are four cpn60 sequence-based subgroups within the genus (A, B, C, and D), and thirteen genome species have been defined recently. Gardnerella spp. co-occur in the vaginal microbiome with varying abundance, and these patterns are shaped by a resource-dependent, exploitative competition, which affects the growth rate of subgroup A, B, and C negatively. The growth rate of rarely abundant subgroup D, however, increases with the increasing number of competitors, negatively affecting the growth rate of others. We hypothesized that a nutritional generalist lifestyle and minimal niche overlap with the other, more abundant Gardnerella spp. facilitate the maintenance of subgroup D in the vaginal microbiome through negative-frequency dependent selection. Using 40 whole genome sequences from isolates representing all four subgroups we found that they could be distinguished based on content of their predicted proteomes. Proteins associated with carbohydrate and amino acid uptake and metabolism were significant contributors to the separation of subgroups. Subgroup D isolates had significantly more of their proteins assigned to amino acid metabolism than the other subgroups. Subgroup D isolates were also significantly different from others in terms of number and type of carbon sources utilized in a phenotypic assay, while the other three could not be distinguished. Overall, the results suggest that a generalist lifestyle and lack of niche overlap with other Gardnerella spp. leads to subgroup D being favoured by negative-frequency dependent selection in the vaginal microbiome.",

The US-1 genotype was found in only 27% of the samples and was found later on all continents except Australia/Oceania.

    "abstract": "The nucleus is a highly organized arrangement of RNA, DNA, and protein molecules that are compartmentalized within three-dimensional (3D) structures involved in shared functional and regulatory processes. Although RNA has long been proposed to play a global role in organizing nuclear structure, exploring the role of RNA in shaping nuclear structure has remained a challenge because no existing methods can simultaneously measure RNA-RNA, RNA-DNA, and DNA-DNA contacts within 3D structures. To address this, we developed RNA & DNA SPRITE (RD-SPRITE) to comprehensively map the location of all RNAs relative to DNA and other RNAs. Using this approach, we identify many RNAs that are localized near their transcriptional loci (RNA-DNA) together with other diffusible ncRNAs (RNA-RNA) within higher-order DNA structures (DNA-DNA). These RNA-chromatin compartments span three major classes of nuclear functions: RNA processing (including ribosome biogenesis, mRNA splicing, snRNA biogenesis, and histone mRNA processing), heterochromatin assembly, and gene regulation. More generally, we identify hundreds of ncRNAs that form stable nuclear compartments in spatial proximity to their transcriptional loci. We find that dozens of nuclear compartments require RNA to guide protein regulators into these 3D structures, and focusing on several ncRNAs, we show that these ncRNAs specifically regulate heterochromatin assembly and the expression of genes contained within these compartments. Together, our results demonstrate a unique mechanism by which RNA acts to shape nuclear structure by forming high concentration territories immediately upon transcription, binding to diffusible regulators, and guiding them into spatial compartments to regulate a wide range of essential nuclear functions.",

    "abstract": "Heme biosynthesis occurs through a series of reactions that take place within the cytoplasm and mitochondria, thus intermediates need to move across these cellular compartments. However, the specific membrane transport mechanisms involved in the process are not yet identified. The ATP-binding cassette protein ABCB10 is essential for normal heme production, as knocking down this transporter in mice is embryonically lethal and accompanied by severe anemia plus oxidative damage. The role of ABCB10 is unknown, but given its location in the inner mitochondrial membrane, it has been proposed as a candidate to export either an early heme precursor or heme. Alternatively, ABCB10 might transport a molecule important for protection against oxidative damage. To help discern between these possibilities, we decided to study the effect of heme analogs, precursors and antioxidant peptides on purified human ABCB10. Since substrate binding increases the ATP hydrolysis rate of ABC transporters, we have determined the ability of these molecules to activate purified ABCB10 reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs using ATPase measurements. Under our experimental conditions, we found that the only heme analog increasing ABCB10 ATPase activity was Zinc-mesoporphyrin. This activation of almost seventy percent was specific for ABCB10, as the ATPase activity of a negative control bacterial ABC transporter was not affected. The activation was also observed in cysteine-less ABCB10, suggesting that Zinc-mesoporphyrins effect did not require binding to typical heme regulatory motifs. Furthermore, our data indicate that ABCB10 was not directly activated by neither the early heme precursor delta-aminolevulinic acid nor glutathione, downsizing their relevance as putative substrates for this transporter. Although additional studies are needed to determine the physiological substrate of ABCB10, our findings reveal Zinc-mesoporphyrin as the first tool compound to directly modulate ABCB10 activity and raise the possibility that some actions of Zinc-mesoporphyrin in cellular and animal studies could be mediated by ABCB10.",

Accurately predicting drug response for a given cell line based on molecular features may help to optimize drug-development pipelines and explain mechanisms behind treatment responses. In this study, we focus on DNA methylation profiles as one type of molecular feature that is known to drive tumorigenesis and modulate treatment responses. Using genome-wide, DNA methylation profiles from 987 cell lines from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, we applied machine-learning algorithms to evaluate the potential to predict cytotoxic responses for eight anti-cancer drugs. We compared the performance of five classification algorithms and four regression algorithms that use diverse methodologies, including tree-, probability-, kernel-, ensemble-, and distance-based approaches. For both types of algorithm, we artificially subsampled the data to varying degrees, aiming to understand whether training models based on relatively extreme outcomes would yield improved performance. We also performed an information-gain analysis to examine which genes were most predictive of drug responses. Finally, we used tumor data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to evaluate the feasibility of predicting clinical responses in humans based on models derived from cell lines. When using classification or regression algorithms to predict discrete or continuous responses, respectively, we consistently observed excellent predictive performance when the training and test sets both consisted of cell-line data. However, classification models derived from cell-line data failed to generalize effectively for tumors.",

    "abstract": "Seeds are the basis of agriculture, yet their full transcriptional complexity has remained unknown. Here, we employ single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to characterize developing Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, with a focus on endosperm. Endosperm, the site of gene imprinting in plants, mediates the relationship between the maternal parent and embryo. We identify new cell types in the chalazal endosperm region, which interfaces with maternal tissue for nutrient unloading. We further demonstrate that the extent of parental bias of maternally expressed imprinted genes varies with cell cycle phase, and that imprinting of paternally expressed imprinted genes is strongest in chalazal endosperm. These data indicate imprinting in endosperm is heterogeneous and suggest that parental conflict, which is proposed to drive the evolution of imprinting, is fiercest at the boundary between filial and maternal tissues.",

    "abstract": "White matter pathways form a complex network of myelinated axons that regulate signal transmission in the nervous system and play a key role in behaviour and cognition. Recent evidence reveals that white matter networks are adaptive and that myelin remodels itself in an activity-dependent way, during both developmental stages and later on through behaviour and learning. As a result, axonal conduction delays continuously adjust in order to regulate the timing of neural signals propagating between different brain areas. This delay plasticity mechanism has yet to be integrated in computational neural models, where conduction delays are oftentimes constant or simply ignored. As a first approach to adaptive white matter remodelling, we modified the canonical Kuramoto model by enabling all connections with adaptive, phase-dependent delays. We analyzed the equilibria and stability of this system, and applied our results to two oscillator and large dimensional networks. Our joint mathematical and numerical analysis demonstrates that plastic delays act as a stabilizing mechanism promoting the networks ability to maintain synchronous activity. Our work also shows that global synchronization is more resilient to perturbations and injury towards network architecture. Our results provide key insights about the analysis and potential significance of activity-dependent myelination in large-scale brain synchrony.",

    "abstract": "Competent social functioning of group-living species relies on the ability of individuals to detect and utilize conspecific social cues to guide behavior. Previous studies have identified numerous brain regions involved in processing these external cues, collectively referred to as the Social Decision-Making Network. However, how the brain encodes social information with respect to an individuals social status has not been thoroughly examined. In mice, cues about an individuals identity, including social status, are conveyed through urinary proteins. In this study, we assessed the neural cFos immunoreactivity in dominant and subordinate male mice exposed to familiar and unfamiliar dominant and subordinate male urine. The posteroventral medial amygdala was the only brain region that responded exclusively to dominant compared to subordinate male urine. In all other brain regions, including the VMH, PMv, and vlPAG, activity is modulated by a combination of odor familiarity and the social status of both the urine donor and the subject receiving the cue. We show that dominant subjects exhibit robust differential activity across different types of cues compared to subordinate subjects, suggesting that individuals perceive social cues differently depending on social experience. These data inform further investigation of neurobiological mechanisms underlying social-status related brain differences and behavior.",

Our recent work demonstrates that the RNA-binding protein Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is downregulated in dendrites upon treatment with a rapid antidepressant. Here, we show that the behavioral effects of the rapid antidepressant Ro-25-6981 require FMRP expression, and treatment promotes differential mRNA binding to FMRP in an mTORC1-dependent manner. Further, these mRNAs are identified to regulate transsynaptic signaling. Using a novel technique, we show that synapse formation underlying the behavioral effects of Ro-25-6981 requires GABABR-mediated mTORC1 activity in WT animals. Finally, we demonstrate that in an animal model that lacks FMRP expression and has clinical relevance for Fragile X Syndrome (FXS), GABABR activity is detrimental to the effects of Ro-25-6981. These effects are rescued with the combined therapy of blocking GABABRs and NMDARs, indicating that rapid antidepressants alone may not be an effective treatment for people with comorbid FXS and MDD.",

    "abstract": "Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), the major causative gene product of autosomal-dominant Parkinsons disease, is a protein kinase that phosphorylates a subset of Rab GTPases. Since pathogenic LRRK2 mutations increase its ability to phosphorylate Rab GTPases, elucidating the mechanisms of how Rab phosphorylation is regulated by LRRK2 is of great importance. We have previously reported that chloroquine-induced lysosomal stress facilitates LRRK2 phosphorylation of Rab10 to maintain lysosomal homeostasis. Here we reveal that Rab10 phosphorylation by LRRK2 is potently stimulated by treatment of cells with a set of lysosome stressors and clinically used lysosomotropic drugs. These agents commonly promoted the formation of LRRK2-coated enlarged lysosomes and extracellular release of lysosomal enzyme cathepsin B, the latter being dependent on LRRK2 kinase activity. In contrast to the increase in Rab10 phosphorylation, treatment with lysosomotropic drugs did not increase the enzymatic activity of LRRK2, as monitored by its autophosphorylation at Ser1292 residue, but rather enhanced the molecular proximity between LRRK2 and its substrate Rab GTPases on the cytosolic surface of lysosomes. Lysosomotropic drug-induced upregulation of Rab10 phosphorylation was likely a downstream event of Rab29 (Rab7L1)-mediated enzymatic activation of LRRK2. These results suggest a regulated process of Rab10 phosphorylation by LRRK2 that is associated with lysosomal overload stress, and provide insights into the novel strategies to halt the aberrant upregulation of LRRK2 kinase activity.",

Prior studies in Drosophila ovaries have demonstrated the function of piRNA pathway in transposon silencing and therefore genome defense. However, the ability of piRNA program to respond to different transposon landscape and the role of piRNAs in regulating host gene expression remain poorly understood. Here, we comprehensively analyzed piRNA expression and defined the repertoire of their targets in Drosophila melanogaster testes. Comparison of piRNA programs between sexes revealed sexual dimorphism in piRNA programs that parallel sex-specific transposon expression. Using a novel bioinformatic pipeline, we identified new piRNA clusters and established complex satellites as dual-strand piRNA clusters. While sharing most piRNA clusters, two sexes employ them differentially to combat sex-specific transposon landscape. We found several host genes targeted by piRNAs in testis, including CG12717/pita, a SUMO protease gene. piRNAs encoded on Y chromosome silence pita, but not its paralog, to exert sex- and paralog-specific gene regulation. Interestingly, pita is targeted by endogenous siRNAs in a sibling species, Drosophila mauritiana, suggesting distinct but related silencing strategies invented in recent evolution to regulate a conserved protein-encoding gene.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt is unknown whether liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) metabolize alcohol. Chronic alcohol consumption decreases endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS)-derived NO production typical of LSEC dysfunction. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) interacts with eNOS to increase its activity. Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) is a key enzyme in alcohol metabolism and facilitates protein acetylation via acetyl-CoA, but its expression in LSECs is unknown. This study investigates alcohol metabolism by LSECs, the mechanism of alcohol-induced LSEC dysfunction and a potential therapeutic approach for alcohol-induced liver injury.\n\nMethodsPrimary human, rat and mouse LSECs were used. Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) was overexpressed specifically in liver ECs using an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene delivery system to decrease Hsp90 acetylation in ethanol fed mice.\n\nResultsLSECs expressed CYP2E1 and alcohol dehydrogenase 1 (ADH1) and metabolized alcohol. Ethanol induced CYP2E1 in LSECs, but not ADH1. Alcohol metabolism by CYP2E1 increased Hsp90 acetylation and decreased its interaction with eNOS along with a decrease in NO production. A non-acetylation mutant of Hsp90 increased its interaction with eNOS and NO production, whereas a hyper-acetylation mutant decreased NO production, compared with wildtype Hsp90. These results indicate that Hsp90 acetylation is responsible for decreases in its interaction with eNOS and eNOS-derived NO production. Adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8)-driven HDAC6 overexpression specifically in liver ECs deacetylated Hsp90, restored Hsp90s interaction with eNOS and ameliorated alcohol-induced liver injury in mice.\n\nConclusionRestoring LSEC function is important for ameliorating alcohol-induced liver injury. To this end, blocking acetylation of Hsp90 specifically in LSECs via AAV-mediated gene delivery has the potential to be a new therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Changes in climatic conditions increases the risks of native and alien taxa expanding in geographical range and causing habitat transformations. The role of climate change in enhancing bio-invasions in local natural environments need to be assessed to guide on effective species management policy formulations. In this present study, we used species presence records, predictor variables and an ensemble of General Circulation Models data to predict suitable ecological niches for five of the selected invasive plant species within Nyeri County, Kenya. We predicted species distributions under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 emission scenarios for the years 2050 and 2070. We analysed species distribution changes to identify invasive species requiring immediate management action. Our analysis indicated that three of the five study species were suitable in ~50% of the study area while the other two were suitable in ~30% under the current climate. Lantana camara L. and Solanum campylacanthum Hochst. ex A. Rich species would experience the largest range shift distance of ~6 - 10km and the largest habitat gain of ~12 - 33% in the future. Caesalpinia decapetala (Roth) Alston, Opuntia stricta (Haw.) Haw. and Senna didymobotrya (Fresen.) H.S. Irwin & Barneby species on the other hand would have a decline in habitat range under future climate change scenarios. Although, S. didymobotrya is considered a native species, it would lose half of its current suitable habitat in the future. Range shift analysis showed all study species would generally shift to the north west direction or towards the Aberdare ranges. From this study we conclude that invasive species management programs for smaller geographical areas ought to consider projecting species distributions under climate change scenarios to identify areas with high possible biodiversity changes. This would be important to conservationists when prioritizing management actions of invasive species in the region where data on invasive species is still limited.",

    "abstract": "The importance of research ethics (RE) training has led academic and funding institutions to require that students, trainees, and faculty obtain such training at various stages of their careers. Despite the increasing awareness of the value RE education offers, this training requirement is absent in Jordan. We aimed to assess RE education offerings of pharmacy master programs in Jordan and compare with the top-ranked pharmacy graduate programs globally. Therefore, a list of universities that offer research-based pharmacy master programs was created. Each program was evaluated for the inclusion of RE education. A qualitative content analysis approach based on inductive reasoning and latent analysis was followed to analyze the data. Results of the study showed a lack of appropriate RE education for graduate-level pharmacy programs in Jordan with only 40% of the programs partially discuss selected topics related to RE. Regarding pharmacy graduate programs globally, 10% offer a standalone RE course, 40% offer some discussions related to RE, another 10% do not offer RE education in any form, and the remaining 40% of the programs were difficult to assess due to lack of sufficient information available online. Based on the findings of this study, training in RE is tends to be lacking in pharmacy graduate programs in Jordan and globally, with a greater lack in Jordan than globally. There is a need to incorporate formal RE education into programs that do not offer this type of instruction. Programs that formally touch on some aspects of RE need to expand the scope of topics to include more RE-related themes. Integrating a standalone RE course into pharmacy graduate programs is highly encouraged.",

    "abstract": "piRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that guide the silencing of transposons and other targets in animal gonads. In Drosophila female germline, many piRNA source loci dubbed  piRNA clusters lack hallmarks of active genes and exploit an alternative path for transcription, which relies on the Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff (RDC) complex. It remains to date unknown how piRNA cluster transcription is regulated in the male germline. We found that components of RDC complex are expressed in male germ cells during early spermatogenesis, from germline stem cells (GSCs) to early spermatocytes. RDC is essential for expression of dual-strand piRNA clusters and transposon silencing in testis; however, it is dispensable for expression of Y-linked Suppressor of Stellate piRNAs and therefore Stellate silencing. Despite intact Stellate repression, rhi mutant males exhibited compromised fertility accompanied by germline DNA damage and GSC loss. Thus, piRNA-guided repression is essential for normal spermatogenesis beyond Stellate silencing. While RDC associates with multiple piRNA clusters in GSCs and early spermatogonia, its localization changes in later stages as RDC concentrates on a single X-linked locus, AT-chX. Dynamic RDC localization is paralleled by changes in piRNA cluster expression, indicating that RDC executes a fluid piRNA program during different stages of spermatogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Resistance mutations against one drug can elicit collateral sensitivity against other drugs. Multi-drug treatments exploiting such trade-offs can help slow down the evolution of resistance. However, if mutations with diverse collateral effects are available, a treated population may evolve either collateral sensitivity or collateral resistance. How to design treatments robust to such uncertainty is unclear. We show that many resistance mutations in Escherichia coli against various antibiotics indeed have diverse collateral effects. We propose to characterize such diversity with a joint distribution of fitness effects (JDFE) and develop a theory for describing and predicting collateral evolution based on simple statistics of the JDFE. We show how to robustly rank drug pairs to minimize the risk of collateral resistance and how to estimate JDFEs. In addition to practical applications, these results have implications for our understanding of evolution in variable environments.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays major roles in the central control of energy balance. Loss-of-function mutations of MC4R constitute the most common monogenic cause of early-onset extreme obesity in humans, whereas gain-of-function mutations appear to be protective. In particular, two relatively frequent alleles carrying the non-synonymous coding mutations V103I or I251L have been associated with lower risks of obesity and type-2 diabetes. Although V103I and I251L MC4Rs showed more efficient signaling in transfected cells, their specific effects in live animals remain unexplored. Here, we investigated whether the introduction of V103I and I251L mutations into the mouse MC4R leads to a lean phenotype and provides protection against an obesogenic diet.\n\nMethodsUsing CRISPR/Cas9, we generated two novel strains of mice carrying single nucleotide mutations into the mouse Mc4r which are identical to those present in V103I and I251L MCR4 human alleles, and studied their phenotypic outcomes in mice fed with normal chow or a high- fat diet. In particular, we measured body weight progression, food intake and adiposity. In addition, we analyzed glucose homeostasis through glucose and insulin tolerance tests.\n\nResultsWe found that homozygous V103I females displayed shorter longitudinal length and decreased abdominal white fat, whereas homozygous I251L females were also shorter and leaner due to decreased weight in all white fat pads examined. Homozygous Mc4rV103I/V103I and Mc4rI251L/I251L mice of both sexes showed improved glucose homeostasis when challenged in a glucose tolerance test, whereas Mc4rI251L/I251L females showed improved responses to insulin. Despite being leaner and metabolically more efficient, V103I and I251L mutants fed with a hypercaloric diet increased their fasting glucose levels and adiposity similar to their wild-type littermates.\n\nConclusionsAltogether, our results demonstrate that mice carrying V103I and I251L MC4R mutations displayed gain-of-function phenotypes that were more evident in females. However, hypermorphic MC4R mutants were as susceptible as their control littermates to the obesogenic and diabetogenic effects elicited by a long-term hypercaloric diet, highlighting the importance of healthy feeding habits even under favorable genetic conditions.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIdentical single nucleotide substitutions to gain-of-function mutations of the human MC4R were introduced into the genome of inbred mice using CRISPR/Cas9 technology.\nC_LIO_LIHomozygous female carriers of V103I Mc4r alleles are shorter and display reduced adiposity, together with improved glucose homeostasis in both sexes.\nC_LIO_LIHomozygous females carrying the I251L mutation in the mouse MC4R also display shorter longitudinal length, decreased weight in all abdominal white fat pads and improved glucose clearance and insulin response.\nC_LIO_LIGain-of-function mutations V103I and I251L of MC4R do not protect against the diabetogenic and adipogenic effects of a high-fat diet.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains a treatment-refractory disease. Characterizing PDAC by mRNA profiling remains particularly challenging. Previously identified bulk expression subtypes were influenced by contaminating stroma and have not yet informed clinical management, whereas single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of fresh tumors under-represented key cell types. Here, we developed a robust single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) technique for frozen archival PDAC specimens and used it to study both untreated tumors and those that received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy (CRT). Gene expression programs learned across untreated malignant cell and fibroblast profiles uncovered a clinically relevant molecular taxonomy with improved prognostic stratification compared to prior classifications. Moreover, in the increasingly-adopted neoadjuvant treatment context, there was a depletion of classical-like phenotypes in malignant cells in favor of basal-like phenotypes associated with TNF-NFkB and interferon signaling as well as the presence of novel acinar and neuroendocrine classical-like states, which may be more resilient to cytotoxic treatment. Spatially-resolved transcriptomics revealed an association between malignant cells expressing these basal-like programs and higher immune infiltration with increased lymphocytic content, whereas those exhibiting classical-like programs were linked to sparser macrophage-predominant microniches, perhaps pointing to susceptibility to distinct therapeutic strategies. Our refined molecular taxonomy and spatial resolution can help advance precision oncology in PDAC through informative stratification in clinical trials and insights into differential therapeutic targeting leveraging the immune system.",
