    "abstract": "Copper(II) is known to bind in the influenza virus His37 cluster in the homotetrameric M2 proton channel and block the proton current needed for uncoating. Copper complexes based on iminodiacetate also block the M2 proton channel and show reduced cytotoxicity and zebrafish-embryo toxicity. In voltage-clamp oocyte studies using the ubiquitous amantadine-insensitive M2 S31N variant, the current block showed fast and slow phases in contrast to the single phase found for amantadine block of WT M2. Here we evaluate the mechanism of block by copper adamantyl iminodiacitate (Cu(AMT-IDA)) and copper cyclooctyl iminodiacitate (Cu(CO-IDA)) complexes and address whether the complexes can covalently bind to one or more of the His37 imidazoles. The current traces were fitted to parametrized master equations. The energetics of binding and the rate constants suggest that the first step is copper-complex binding within the channel and the slow step in the current block is the covalent bond formation between copper complex and histidine. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) indicates that a single imidazole binds strongly to the copper complexes. Structural optimization using density functional theory (DFT) reveals that the complexes fit inside the channel and project the Cu(II) towards the His37 cluster allowing one imidazole to form a covalent bond with the Cu(II). Electrophysiology and DFT studies also show that the complexes block the G34E amantadine-resistant mutant in spite of some crowding in the binding site by the glutamates.",

    "abstract": "The N protein of betacoronaviruses is responsible for nucleocapsid assembly and other essential regulatory functions. Its N-terminal domain (NTD) interacts and melts the double-stranded transcriptional regulatory sequences (dsTRS), regulating the discontinuous subgenome transcription process. Here, we used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the binding of SARS-CoV-2 N-NTD to non-specific (NS) and TRS dsRNAs. We probed dsRNAs Watson and Crick (WC) base-pairing over 25 replicas of 100 ns MD simulations, showing that only one N-NTD of dimeric N is enough to destabilize dsRNAs, initiating melting. N-NTD dsRNA destabilizing activity was more efficient for dsTRS than dsNS. N-NTD dynamics, especially a tweezer-like motion of {beta}2-{beta}3 and 2-{beta}5 loops, played a key role in WC base-pairing destabilization. Based on experimental information available in the literature, we constructed kinetics models for N-NTD-mediated dsRNA melting. Our results support a 1:1 stoichiometry (N-NTD:dsRNA), matching MD simulations and raising different possibilities for N-NTD action: (i) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would act independently, increasing efficiency; (ii) two N-NTDs of dimeric N would bind to two different RNA sites, bridging distant regions of the genome; and (iii) monomeric N would be active, opening up the possibility of a regulatory dissociation event.\n\nIMPORTANCECoronaviruses are among the largest positive-sense RNA viruses. They display a unique discontinous transcription mechanism, involving N protein as a major player. The N-NTD promote the dsRNA melting releasing the nascent sense negative strand via a poorly known mechanism of action. It specifically recognizes the body TRS conserved RNA motif located at the 5 end of each ORF. N protein has the ability to transfer the nascent RNA strand to the leader TRS. The mechanism is essential and one single mutation at the RNA binding site of the N-NTD impairs the viral replication. Here, we describe a counterintuitive mechanism of action of N-NTD based on molecular dynamics simulation and kinetic modelling of the experimental melting activity of N-NTD. This data impacts directly in the understanding of the way N protein acts in the cell and will guide future experiments.",

    "abstract": "SNARE is the essential mediator of membrane fusion that highly relies on the molecular structure of SNAREs. For instance, the protein syntaxin-1 involving in neuronal SNAREs, has a single transmembrane domain (sTMD) leading to fast fusion, while the syntaxin 17 has a V-shape double TMDs (dTMDs), taking part in the autophagosome maturation. However, it is not clear how the TMD structure influences the fusion process. Here, we demonstrate that the dTMDs significantly reduce fusion rate compared with the sTMD by using an in vitro reconstitution system. Through theoretical analysis, we reveal that the V-shape dTMDs can significantly increase protein-lipid mismatch, thereby raising the energy barrier of the fusion, and that increasing the number of SNAREs can reduce the energy barrier or protein-lipid mismatch. This study provides a physical-chemical mechanistic understanding of SNARE-regulated membrane fusion.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic reprogramming provides transformed cells with proliferative and/or survival advantages. However, capitalizing on this therapeutically has been only moderately successful due to the relatively small magnitude of these differences and because cancers may re-program their metabolism to evade metabolic pathway inhibition. Mice lacking the peroxisomal bi-functional enzyme enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (Ehhadh) and supplemented with the 12-carbon fatty acid lauric acid (C12) accumulate dodecanedioic acid (DDDA), a toxic C12 metabolite that causes hepatocyte necrosis and acute liver failure. In a murine model of pediatric hepatoblastoma (HB), down-regulation of Ehhadh also occurs in combination with a more general suppression of mitochondrial {beta}- and peroxisomal {omega}-fatty acid oxidation (FAO) pathways. HB-bearing mice provided with C12 and/or DDDA-supplemented diets survived significantly longer than those on standard diets. The tumors also developed massive necrosis in response to short-term DDDA supplementation. Reduced Ehhadh was noted in murine hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and in substantial subsets of human cancers, including HCCs. Acquired DDDA resistance was not associated with Ehhadh re-expression but was associated with 129 transcript differences ~90% of which were down-regulated in DDDA-resistant tumors and ~two-thirds of which correlated with survival in several human cancers. These transcripts often encoded components of the extracellular matrix suggesting that DDDA resistance arises from its reduced intracellular transport. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of a metabolic intervention that is non-toxic, inexpensive and likely compatible with traditional therapies. C12 and/or DDDA-containing diets could potentially be used to supplement other treatments or as alternative therapeutic choices.",

    "abstract": "We screened steroid compounds to obtain a drug expected to block host inflammatory responses and MERS-CoV replication. Ciclesonide, an inhaled corticosteroid, suppressed replication of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, in cultured cells. The effective concentration (EC90) of ciclesonide for SARS-CoV-2 in differentiated human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells was 0.55 M. Ciclesonide inhibited formation of double membrane vesicles, which anchor the viral replication-transcription complex in cells. Eight consecutive passages of 43 SARS-CoV-2 isolates in the presence of ciclesonide generated 15 resistant mutants harboring single amino acid substitutions in non-structural protein 3 (nsp3) or nsp4. Of note, ciclesonide still suppressed replication of all these mutants by 90% or more, suggesting that these mutants cannot completely overcome ciclesonide blockade. These observations indicate that the suppressive effect of ciclesonide on viral replication is specific to coronaviruses, highlighting it as a candidate drug for the treatment of COVID-19 patients.\n\nImportanceThe outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, the cause of COVID-19, is ongoing. To identify the effective antiviral agents to combat the disease is urgently needed. In the present study, we found that an inhaled corticosteroid, ciclesonide suppresses replication of coronaviruses, including beta-coronaviruses (MHV-2, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2) and an alpha-coronavirus (HCoV-229E) in cultured cells. The inhaled ciclesonide is safe; indeed, it can be administered to infants at high concentrations. Thus, ciclesonide is expected to be a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is effective against many members of the coronavirus family. It could be prescribed for the treatment of MERS, and COVID-19.",

Cognitive training was given at the age of 3, 6, 9 & 12 months of age. Single-domain cognitive training was limited to a spatial navigation task. Multi-domain cognitive training consisted of a spatial navigation task, object recognition, and fear conditioning.

AppNL-G-F mice given multi-domain cognitive training compared to APPNL-G-F control group showed an improvement in cognitive functions, reductions in amyloid load and microgliosis, and a preservation of cholinergic function. There were mild reductions in microglosis in the brain of APPNL-G-F mice with singledomain cognitive training.

    "abstract": "The isobaric carrier approach, which combines small isobarically-labeled samples with a larger isobarically-labeled carrier sample, is finding diverse applications in ultrasensitive mass-spectrometry analysis of very small samples, such as single cells. To enhance the growing use of isobaric carriers, we characterized the trade-offs of using isobaric carriers in controlled experiments with complex human proteomes. The data indicate that isobaric carriers directly enhances peptide sequence identification without simultaneously increasing the number of protein copies sampled from small samples. The results also indicate strategies for optimizing the amount of isobaric carrier and analytical parameters, such as ion accumulation time, for different priorities such as improved quantification or increased number of identified proteins. Balancing these trade-offs enables adapting isobaric carrier experiments to different applications, such as quantifying proteins from limited biopsies or organoids, building single-cell atlases, or modeling protein networks in single cells. In all cases, the reliability of protein quantification should be estimated and incorporated in all subsequent analysis. We expect that these guidelines will aid in explicit incorporation of the characterized trade-offs in experimental designs and transparent error propagation in data analysis.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia (BG) are thought to contribute to decision-making and motor control by influencing action selection based on consequences. These functions are critically dependent on timing information that can be extracted from the evolving state of neural populations in the striatum, the major input area of the BG. However, it is debated whether striatal activity underlies latent, dynamic decision processes or kinematics of overt movement. Here, we measured the impact of temperature on striatal population activity and the behavior of rats and compared the observed effects to neural activity and behavior collected in multiple versions of a temporal categorization task. Cooler temperatures caused dilation, and warmer temperatures contraction, of both neural activity and patterns of judgment in time, mimicking endogenous decision-related variability in striatal activity. However, temperature did not similarly affect movement kinematics. These data provide compelling evidence that the time course of evolving striatal population activity dictates the speed of a latent process that is used to guide choices, but not moment by moment kinematics. More broadly, they establish temporal scaling of population activity as a likely cause and not simply a correlate of timing behavior in the brain.",

We studied the functional role of BDNF axonal signaling in cortical neurons derived from different transgenic mice using compartmentalized cultures in microfluidic devices. We found that axonal BDNF increased dendritic growth from the neuronal cell body in a cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB)-dependent manner. These effects were dependent on axonal TrkB but not p75 activity. Dynein-dependent BDNF-TrkB-containing endosome transport was required for long-distance induction of dendritic growth. Axonal signaling endosomes increased CREB and mTOR kinase activity in the cell body, and this increase in the activity of both proteins was required for general protein translation and the expression of Arc, a plasticity-associated gene, indicating a role for BDNF-TrkB axonal signaling endosomes in coordinating the transcription and translation of genes whose products contribute to learning and memory regulation.",

    "abstract": "Given the aggressive spread of COVID-19-related deaths, there is an urgent public health need to support the development of vaccine candidates to rapidly improve the available control measures against SARS-CoV-2. To meet this need, we are leveraging our existing vaccine platform to target SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated cellular heat shock chaperone protein, glycoprotein 96 (gp96), to deliver SARS-CoV-2 protein S (spike) to the immune system and to induce cell-mediated immune responses. We showed that our vaccine platform effectively stimulates a robust cellular immune response against protein S. Moreover, we confirmed that gp96-Ig, secreted from allogeneic cells expressing full-length protein S, generates powerful, protein S polyepitope-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in both lung interstitium and airways. These findings were further strengthened by the observation that protein-S -specific CD8+ T cells were induced in human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-02-01 transgenic mice thus providing encouraging translational data that the vaccine is likely to work in humans, in the context of SARS-CoV-2 antigen presentation.",

    "abstract": "Relative deficiency of TOLLIP expression in monocytes is associated with increased tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility in genetic studies, despite antagonizing host innate immune pathways that control Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which TOLLIP influences Mtb immunity. Tollip-/- mice developed worsened disease, consistent with prior genetic observations, and developed large numbers of foam cells. Selective TOLLIP deletion in alveolar macrophages (AM) was sufficient to induce lipid accumulation and increased Mtb persistence 28 days after infection, despite increased antimicrobial responses. We analyzed sorted, Mtb-infected Tollip-/- AM from mixed bone marrow chimeric mice to measure global gene expression 28 days post-infection. We found transcriptional profiles consistent with increased EIF2 signaling. Selective lipid administration to Tollip-/- macrophages induced lipid accumulation, and Mtb infection of lipid laden, Tollip-/- macrophages induced cellular stress and impaired Mtb control. EIF2 activation induced increased Mtb replication within macrophages, irrespective of TOLLIP expression, and EIF2 kinases were enriched in human caseous granulomas. Our findings define a critical checkpoint for TOLLIP to prevent lipid-induced EIF2 activation and demonstrate an important mechanism for EIF2 signaling to permit Mtb replication within macrophages.",

    "abstract": "The differentiation of CD4 T cells to a specific effector fate is metabolically regulated, integrating glycolysis and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) with transcriptional and epigenetic changes. OXPHOS is tightly coordinated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle but the precise role of TCA intermediates in CD4 T cell differentiation remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that -ketoglutarate (KG) inhibited regulatory T cell (Treg) generation while conversely, increasing Th1 polarization. In accord with these data, KG promoted the effector profile of Treg-polarized chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T cells against the ErbB2 tumor antigen. Mechanistically, KG significantly altered transcripts of genes involved in lipid-related processes, inducing a robust lipidome-wide remodelling and decreased membrane fluidity. A massive increase in storage and mitochondria lipids was associated with expression of mitochondrial genes and a significantly augmented OXPHOS. Notably, inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase activity, the bridge between the TCA cycle and the electron transport chain, enforced Treg generation. Thus, our study identifies novel connections between KG, lipidome remodelling and OXPHOS in CD4 T cell fate decisions.",

    "abstract": "Upon detection of a pathogen, the innate immune system triggers signaling events leading to the transcription of mRNAs that encode for pro-inflammatory and anti-microbial effectors. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interact with these functionally critical mRNAs and temporally regulate their fates at the post-transcriptional level. One such RBP is ELAVL1, which is known to bind to introns and 3UTRs. While significant progress has been made in understanding how ELAVL1 regulates mRNAs, how its target repertoire and binding affinity changes within an immunological context remains poorly understood. Here, we overlap four distinct high-throughput approaches to define its cell-type and context-dependent targets and determine its regulatory impact during immune activation. ELAVL1 overwhelmingly binds to intronic sites in a naive state, but during an innate immune response, ELAVL1 targets the 3UTR - binding both previously and newly expressed mRNAs. We find that ELAVL1 mediates the RNA stability of genes that regulate the pathways involved in pathogen sensing and cytokine production. Our findings reveal the importance of examining RBP regulatory impact under dynamic transcriptomic events to best understand their post-transcriptional regulatory roles within specific biological circuitries.",

    "abstract": "DNA replication is regulated by the location and timing of replication initiation. Therefore, much effort has been invested in identifying and analyzing the sites of human replication initiation. However, the heterogeneous nature of eukaryotic replication kinetics and the low efficiency of individual initiation site utilization in metazoans has made mapping the location and timing of replication initiation in human cells difficult. A potential solution to the problem of human replication mapping is single-molecule analysis. However, current approaches do not provide the throughput required for genome-wide experiments. To address this challenge, we have developed Optical Replication Mapping (ORM), a high-throughput single-molecule approach to map newly replicated DNA, and used it to map early initiation events in human cells. The single-molecule nature of our data, and a total of more than 2000-fold coverage of the human genome on 27 million fibers averaging ~300 kb in length, allow us to identify initiation sites and their firing probability with high confidence. In particular, for the first time, we are able to measure genome-wide the absolute efficiency of human replication initiation. We find that the distribution of human replication initiation is consistent with inefficient, stochastic initiation of heterogeneously distributed potential initiation complexes enriched in accessible chromatin. In particular, we find sites of human replication initiation are not confined to well-defined replication origins but are instead distributed across broad initiation zones consisting of many initiation sites. Furthermore, we find no correlation of initiation events between neighboring initiation zones. Although most early initiation events occur in early-replicating regions of the genome, a significant number occur in late-replicating regions. The fact that initiation sites in typically late-replicating regions have some probability of firing in early S phase suggests that the major difference between initiation events in early and late replicating regions is their intrinsic probability of firing, as opposed to a qualitative difference in their firing-time distributions. Moreover, modeling of replication kinetics demonstrates that measuring the efficiency of initiation-zone firing in early S phase suffices to predict the average firing time of such initiation zones throughout S phase, further suggesting that the differences between the firing times of early and late initiation zones are quantitative, rather than qualitative. These observations are consistent with stochastic models of initiation-timing regulation and suggest that stochastic regulation of replication kinetics is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic replication, conserved from yeast to humans.",

Epigenomic regulations have been known to strongly interact with genetic variations and potentially mediate biochemical cascades involved in tumorigenesis. Due to the cell-type specificity of epigenomic features, profiling of individual cell types is critical for understanding the molecular events in various cellular compartments within complex breast tissue. Here we report cell-type-specific profiling of genome-wide histone modifications including H3K27ac and H3K4me3 in basal, luminal progenitor, mature luminal, and stromal cells extracted from pre-cancer BRCA1 mutation carriers and non-carriers, conducted using a low-input technology that we developed. We discover that basal and stromal cells present the most extensive epigenomic differences between mutation carriers (BRCA1mut/+) and non-carriers (BRCA1+/+) while luminal progenitor and mature luminal cells are relatively unchanged with the mutation. Furthermore, the epigenomic changes in basal cells due to BRCA1 mutation appear to facilitate their transformation into luminal progenitor cells. Our findings shed light on the pre-cancer epigenomic dynamics due to BRCA1 mutation and how they may contribute to eventual development of predominantly basal-like breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Selective harvest, such as poaching, impacts group-living animals directly through mortality of individuals with desirable traits, and indirectly by altering the structure of their social networks. Understanding the relationship between the structural network changes and group performance in wild animals remains an outstanding problem. To address this knowledge gap, we evaluate the immediate effect of disturbance on group sociality in African savanna elephants -- an example, group-living species threatened by poaching. Drawing on static association data from one free ranging population, we constructed 100 virtual networks; performed a series of experiments  poaching the oldest, socially central or random individuals; and quantified the immediate change in the theoretical indices of network connectivity and efficiency of social diffusion. Although the virtual networks never broke down, targeted elimination of the socially central conspecifics, regardless of age, decreased network connectivity and efficiency. These findings hint at the need to further study resilience by modeling network reorganization and interaction-mediated socioecological learning, empirical data permitting. Our work is unique in quantifying connectivity together with global efficiency in multiple virtual networks that represent the sociodemographic diversity of elephant populations likely found in the wild. The basic design of our simulation platform makes it adaptable for hypothesis testing about the consequences of anthropogenic disturbance or lethal management on social interactions in a variety of group-living species with limited, real-world data.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe consider the immediate response of animal groups to human disturbance by using the African savanna elephant as an example of a group-living species threatened by poaching. Previous research in one elephant population showed that poaching-induced mortality reduced social interaction among distantly related elephants, but not among close kin. Whether this type of resilience indicates that affected populations function similarity before and after poaching is an open problem. Understanding it is important because poaching often targets the largest and most socially and ecologically experienced group members. Drawing on empirical association data, we simulated poaching in 100 virtual elephant populations and eliminated the most senior or sociable members. Targeted poaching of sociable conspecifics was more impactful. Although it did not lead to population breakdown, it hampered theoretical features of interspecific associations that in other systems have been associated with group cohesion and the efficiency of transferring social information. Our findings suggest that further inquiry into the relationship between resilience to poaching and group performance is warranted. In addition, our simulation platform offers a generalizable basis for hypothesis testing in other social species, wild or captive, subject to exploitation by humans.",

DNA-PK has therefore been pursued for the development of anti-cancer therapeutics in combination with ionizing radiation (IR). We report the discovery of a new class of DNA-PK inhibitors that act via a novel mechanism of action, inhibition of the Ku-DNA interaction. We have developed a series of highly potent and specific Ku-DNA binding inhibitors (Ku-DBis) that block the Ku-DNA interaction and inhibit DNA-PK kinase activity. Ku-DBis directly interact with the Ku and inhibit in vitro NHEJ, cellular NHEJ, and potentiate the activity of IR and radiomimetics. Analysis of Ku-null cells demonstrates that Ku-DBis cellular activity is a direct result of Ku inhibition, as Ku-null cells are insensitive to Ku-DBis. The utility of Ku-DBis was also demonstrated in a CRISPR gene-editing model where we demonstrate that the efficiency of gene insertion events was increased in cells pre-treated with Ku-DBis, consistent with inhibition of NHEJ and activation of homologous recombination to facilitate gene insertion. These data demonstrate the discovery and application of new series of compounds that modulate DNA repair pathways via a unique mechanism of action.",

Genetic deletion of Atm improved survival of mice with p53 deficient but not p53 wild-type gliomas following radiotherapy. Similar to patients with DIPG, mice with p53 wild-type tumors had improved survival after radiotherapy independent of Atm deletion. p53 wild-type tumor cell lines induced proapoptotic genes after radiation and repressed the NRF2 target, Nqo1. Tumors lacking p53 and Ink4a/Arf expressed the highest level of Nqo1 and were most resistant to radiation, but deletion of Atm enhanced the radiation response.

    "abstract": "All what we see, touch, hear, taste or smell must first be detected by the sensory elements in our nervous system. Sensory neurons, therefore, represent a critical component in all neural circuits and their correct function is essential for the generation of behaviour and adaptation to the environment. Here we report that a gene encoding the evolutionarily conserved microRNA (miRNA) miR-263b, plays a key behavioural role in Drosophila through effects on the function of larval sensory neurons. Several independent experiments support this finding. First, miRNA expression analysis by means of a miR-263b reporter line, and fluorescent-activated cell sorting coupled to quantitative PCR, both demonstrate expression of miR-263b in Drosophila larval sensory neurons. Second, behavioural tests in miR-263b null mutants show defects in self-righting: an innate and evolutionarily conserved posture control behaviour that allows the larva to return to its normal position if turned upside-down. Third, competitive inhibition of miR-263b in sensory neurons using a miR-263b  sponge leads to self-righting defects. Fourth, systematic analysis of sensory neurons in miR-263b mutants shows no detectable morphological defects in their stereotypic pattern. Fifth, genetically-encoded calcium sensors expressed in the sensory domain reveal a reduction in neural activity in miR-263b null mutants. Sixth, miR-263b null mutants show a reduced  touch-response behaviour and a compromised response to sound, both characteristic of larval sensory deficits. Furthermore, bioinformatic miRNA target analysis, gene expression assays, and behavioural phenocopy experiments suggest that miR-263b might exert its effects - at least in part - through repression of the bHLH transcription factor atonal. Altogether, our study suggests a model in which miRNA-dependent control of transcription factor expression affects sensory function and behaviour. Building on the evolutionary conservation of miR-263b, we propose that similar processes may modulate sensory function in other animals, including mammals.",

    "abstract": "The mu opioid receptor regulates reward derived from both drug use and natural experiences, including social interaction. Homozygous genetic knockout of the mu opioid receptor (Oprm1-/-) causes social deficits in mice, whereas partial dysregulation of mu opioid signaling has been documented in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we investigated the social behavior of male and female mice with heterozygous genetic knockout of the mu opioid receptor (Oprm1+/-), modeling partial reduction of mu opioid signaling. Reciprocal social interaction and social conditioned place preference were diminished in Oprm1+/- and Oprm1-/- mutants of both sexes. Interaction with Oprm1 mutants also altered the social behavior of genotypical test partners. We corroborated this latter result using a social preference task, in which genotypical mice preferred interactions with another typical mouse over Oprm1 mutants. We also analyzed inhibitory synapses in the nucleus accumbens, a key brain region for mu opioid regulation of social behavior, using methods that differentiate between medium spiny neurons (MSNs) expressing the D1 or D2 dopamine receptor. Inhibitory synaptic transmission was increased in D2-MSNs of male mutants, but not female mutants, while the density of inhibitory synaptic puncta at the cell body of D2-MSNs was increased in both male and female mutants. These changes in nucleus accumbens microcircuitry were more robust in Oprm1+/- mutants than Oprm1-/- mutants, demonstrating that partial reductions of mu opioid signaling can have large effects on brain function and behavior. Our results support a role for partial dysregulation of mu opioid signaling in social deficits associated with neuropsychiatric conditions.",

    "abstract": "To combat infections, hosts employ a combination of antagonistic and cooperative defense strategies. The former refers to pathogen killing mediated by resistance mechanisms, while the latter refers to physiological defense mechanisms that promote host health during infection independent of pathogen killing, leading to an apparent cooperation between the host and the pathogen. Previous work has shown that leptin, a pleiotropic hormone that plays a central role in regulating appetite and energy metabolism, is indispensable for resistance mechanisms, while a role for leptin signaling in cooperative host-pathogen interactions remains unknown. Using a mouse model of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (Yptb) infection, the causative agent of Far East scarlet-like fever, we unexpectedly found that genetic inhibition of leptin signaling conferred protection from Yptb infection due to increased host-pathogen cooperation rather than greater resistance defenses. The protection against Yptb infection was not due to differences in food consumption, lipolysis or fat mass. Furthermore, we found that the survival advantage was associated with increased liver damage and dysfunction. Our work reveals an additional level of complexity for the role of leptin in infection defense and suggests that in some contexts, in addition to tolerating the pathogen, tolerating organ damage and dysfunction is more beneficial for survival than preventing the damage.",

    "abstract": "Rapid modulation of gene expression is a key feature for the success of bacteria, particularly for those that rapidly have to adapt to different niches. The lifecycles of Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus involve a mutualistic association with nematodes as well as an entomopathogenic phase1,2, both of which rely on the production of numerous specialized metabolites (SMs) 3,4. Several regulators have been previously implicated in the regulation of SM production in these genera3,4. However, the molecular underpinnings regulating SM production and the role of small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) in this process are unknown. Here we describe the mechanism underlying RNA-mediated control of SM synthesis. We show that the Hfq-dependent sRNA, ArcZ, is an essential requirement for SM production. We discovered that ArcZ directly base-pairs with the mRNA encoding HexA, a key repressor of SM genes. We further demonstrate that the ArcZ regulon is not restricted to SM production, but rather modulates up to ~15% of the transcriptional output in both Photorhabdus and Xenorhabdus. Together, our study shows that sRNAs are crucial for SM production in these species, reveals previously unknown targets for biosynthetic pathway manipulations, and offers a new tool for the (over)production, isolation and identification of unknown natural products.",

Sulfur metabolizing microbes are infected by phages that can encode auxiliary metabolic genes (AMGs) to alter sulfur metabolism within host cells but remain poorly characterized. Here we identified 191 phages derived from twelve environments that encoded 227 AMGs for oxidation of sulfur and thiosulfate (dsrA, dsrC/tusE, soxC, soxD and soxYZ). Evidence for retention of AMGs during niche-differentiation of diverse phage populations provided evidence that auxiliary metabolism imparts measurable fitness benefits to phages with ramifications for ecosystem biogeochemistry. Gene abundance and expression profiles of AMGs suggested significant contributions by phages to sulfur and thiosulfate oxidation in freshwater lakes and oceans, and a sensitive response to changing sulfur concentrations in hydrothermal environments.

Yet few studies have addressed ERK/MAPK regulation of proliferation within a complete organism. The C. elegans ERK/MAPK ortholog MPK-1 is best known for its control of somatic organogenesis and germline differentiation, but it also stimulates germline stem cell proliferation. Here we identify tissue-specific MPK-1 isoforms and characterize their distinct roles in germline function. The germline-specific MPK-1B isoform promotes germline differentiation, but has no apparent role in germline stem cell proliferation. By contrast, the soma-specific MPK-1A isoform promotes germline proliferation non-autonomously. Indeed, MPK-1A functions in the intestine or somatic gonad to promote germline proliferation, independently of its other known roles. We propose that a non-autonomous role of ERK/MAPK in stem cell proliferation may be conserved across species and other tissue types, with major clinical implications for cancer and other diseases.",

    "abstract": "The alteration of gene expression due to variations in the sequences of transcriptional regulatory elements has been a focus of substantial inquiry in humans and model organisms. However, less is known about the extent to which natural variation contributes to post-transcriptional regulation. Allelic Expression Imbalance (AEI) is a classical approach for studying the association of specific haplotypes with relative changes in transcript abundance. Here, we piloted a new TRAP based approach to associate genetic variation with transcript occupancy on ribosomes in specific cell types, to determine if it will allow examination of Allelic Translation Imbalance (ATI), and Allelic Translation Efficiency Imbalance, using as a test case mouse astrocytes in vivo. We show that most changes of the mRNA levels on ribosomes were reflected in transcript abundance, though [~]1.5% of transcripts have variants that clearly alter loading onto ribosomes orthogonally to transcript levels. These variants were often in conserved residues and altered sequences known to regulate translation such as upstream ORFs, PolyA sites, and predicted miRNA binding sites. Such variants were also common in transcripts showing altered abundance, suggesting some genetic regulation of gene expression may function through post-transcriptional mechanisms. Overall, our work shows that naturally occurring genetic variants can impact ribosome occupancy in astrocytes in vivo and suggests that mechanisms may also play a role in genetic contributions to disease.",

    "abstract": "Genomes of all characterized higher eukaryotes harbor examples of transposable element (TE) bursts - the rapid amplification of TE copies throughout a genome. Despite their prevalence, understanding how bursts diversify genomes requires the characterization of actively transposing TEs before insertion sites and structural rearrangements have been obscured by selection acting over evolutionary time. In this study rice recombinant inbred lines (RILs), generated by crossing a bursting accession and the reference Nipponbare accession were exploited to characterize the spread of the very active Ping/mPing family through a small population and the resulting impact on genome diversity. Comparative sequence analysis of 272 individuals led to the identification of over 14,000 new insertions of the mPing miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) with no evidence for silencing of the transposase-encoding Ping element. In addition to new insertions, Ping-encoded transposase was found to preferentially catalyze the excision of mPing loci tightly linked to a second mPing insertion. Similarly, structural variations, including deletion of rice exons or regulatory regions, were enriched for those with breakpoints at one or both ends of linked mPing elements. Taken together, these results indicate that structural variations are generated during a TE burst as transposase catalyzes both the high copy numbers needed to distribute linked elements throughout the genome and the DNA cuts at the TE ends known to dramatically increase the frequency of recombination.\n\nSignificance StatementTransposable elements (TEs) represent the largest component of the genomes of higher eukaryotes. Among this component are some TEs that have attained very high copy numbers with hundreds, even thousands of elements. By documenting the spread of mPing elements throughout the genomes of a rice population we demonstrate that such bursts of amplification generate functionally relevant genomic variations upon which selection can act. Specifically, continued mPing amplification increases the number of tightly linked elements that, in turn, increases the frequency of structural variations that appear to be derived from aberrant transposition events. The significance of this finding is that it provides a TE-mediated mechanism that may generate much of the structural variation represented by pan-genomes in plants and other organisms.",

We also investigate the adaptation of well-established cross-section data derived from radiation interactions with water to the interactions involving the components of a virion, going beyond the density-scaling approximation developed previously. We conclude that solving one of the grand challenges of structural biology -- the determination of RNA tertiary/quaternary structure -- is intimately linked to predicting ion-beam inactivation of viruses and that the two problems can be mutually informative.

    "abstract": "Some cancers originate from a single mutation event in a single cell. For example, blood cancers known as myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) are thought to originate through the acquisition of a driver mutation (most commonly JAK2-V617F) in a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). However, when the mutation first occurs in individual patients and how it impacts the behavior of HSCs in their native context is not known. Here we quantified the impact of the JAK2-V617F mutation on the proliferation dynamics of HSCs and the differentiation trajectories of their progenies in individual MPN patients. We reconstructed the lineage history of individual HSCs obtained from MPN patients using the patterns of spontaneous somatic mutations accrued in their genomes over time. Strikingly, we found that the JAK2-V617F mutation occurred in a single HSC several decades before MPN diagnosis -- at age 9{+/-}2 years in a 34-year-old patient, and at age 19{+/-}3 years in a 63-year-old patient. For each patient, we inferred the number of mutated HSCs over time and computed their fitness. The population of JAK2-mutated HSCs grew exponentially by 63{+/-}15% and 44{+/-}13% every year in the two patients, respectively. To contrast the differentiation trajectories of the JAK2-mutated HSCs with those of healthy HSCs, we simultaneously measured the full transcriptome and somatic mutations in single hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). We found that the fraction of JAK2-mutant HSPCs varied significantly across different myeloid cell types within the same patient. The erythroid progenitor cells were often entirely JAK2-mutant, even when the peripheral blood JAK2-V617F allele burden was low. The novel biological insights uncovered by this work have implications for the prevention and treatment of MPN, as well as the accurate assessment of disease burden in patients. The technology platforms and computational frameworks developed here are broadly applicable to other types of hematological malignancies and cancers.",

    "abstract": "CPEB proteins are conserved translation regulators involved in multiple biological processes. One of these proteins in Drosophila, Orb2, is a principal player in spermatogenesis. It is required for meiosis and spermatid differentiation. During the later process orb2 mRNAs and proteins are localized within the developing spermatid. To evaluate the role of orb2 mRNA 3UTR in spermatogenesis, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate a deletion of the orb2 3UTR, orb2R. This deletion disrupts the process of spermatid differentiation, but has no apparent effect on meiosis. While this deletion appears to destabilize the orb2 mRNA and reduce the levels of Orb2 protein, this is not the primary cause of the differentiation defects. Instead, differentiation appears to be disrupted because orb2 mRNAs and proteins are not properly localized within the differentiating spermatids. Other transcripts and proteins involved in spermatogenesis are also mislocalized in orb2R spermatids.\n\nAuthor summaryThe conserved family of cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding (CPEB) proteins can activate or repress translation of target mRNAs, depending on the specific biological context, through interaction with special cytoplasmic polyadenylation element (CPE) sequences. These proteins function mainly in highly polarized cells. Orb2, one of the two Drosophila melanogaster CPEB proteins, is predominantly expressed in the testes and is crucial for spermatogenesis. The 3UTR of orb2 transcript contains multiple CPE-like motifs, which is indicative of orb2 self-regulation. We have generated a deletion that removes the greater portion of 3UTR. While this deletion causes a reduction in the levels of orb2 mRNA and the protein, this does not appear to be responsible for the defects in spermatogenesis observed in the deletion mutant. Instead, it is the mislocalization of the mRNA and protein in the developing spermatids.",

    "abstract": "Research on cashmere growth has a significant effect on the production of cashmere and a profound influence on cashmere goat breeding. Whole-genome sequencing is a powerful platform to rapidly gain novel insights into the identification of genetic mechanisms underlying cashmere fiber growth. Here, we generated whole-genome sequences of 115 domestic goats from China, Nepal and Pakistan, including 51 cashmere goats and 64 non-cashmere goats. We found genetically distinct clusters according to their geographic locations but genetic admixture or introgression may have occurred between the Chinese and Nepalese goats. We identified that the fibroblast growth factor 5 gene (FGF5) shows a strong signature for positive selection in the cashmere goat. The 505-bp indel variant at the FGF5 gene locus appeared to be strongly associated with cashmere growth. Functional validation showed that the insertion variant may serve as an enhancer for transcription factor binding, resulting in increased transcription of the upstream FGF5 gene in non-cashmere goats. Our study provides useful information for the sustainable utilization and improved conservation of goat genetic resources and demonstrates that the indel mutation in the FGF5 gene could potentially serve as a molecular marker of cashmere growth in cashmere goat breeding.\n\nAuthor summaryCashmere goats have been selected for thousands of years and have become economically significant livestock in China and other central Asian countries. The mechanism of cashmere growth is not well understood because most studies have focused on the investigation of candidate genes. Here, we conducted a comprehensive whole-genome analysis for selection signatures in a total of 115 goats from 15 genetically diverse goat breeds. The results revealed a strong selection signature at the FGF5 gene locus associated with the cashmere growth phenotype. A 505-bp indel was located in the downstream region of FGF5 and significantly separated in the cashmere goats versus non-cashmere goats. Functional effect analysis of the indel revealed that it may act as an enhancer by specifically binding transcription factors to mediate quantitative changes in FGF5 mRNA expression. Our study illustrates how a structural mutation of the FGF5 gene has contributed to the cashmere growth phenotype in domestic goats.",

    "abstract": "Molecular dating is the estimation of time from genetic sequences. Knowing the time of appearance of a taxon sets the evolutionary context by connecting it with past ecosystems and species. Genomes are made of thousands of genes which can be duplicated or horizontally transfered, thereby providing new material for adaptation. Knowing the time of appearance of genes would provide a context to understand adaptation at the genomic level. However, molecular clock inference faces uncertainty due to the variability of the rate of substitution between species, between genes and between sites within genes. While speciation dating can cope with this variability by concatenating multiple genes and using fossil calibrations, such solutions cannot be applied to date gene-specific events.\n\nThis study aims at benchmarking the accuracy of molecular dating applied to single gene trees, and identify how it is affected by gene tree characteristics. We analyze 5204 alignments of genes from 21 Primates in which no duplication or loss is observed, as well as simulated alignments based on characteristics from Primates. The relaxed log-normal clock dating was performed with the bayesian program Beast2.\n\nFrom the empirical dataset, we find that the precision of dating decreases with shorter alignments, high rate heterogeneity between branches and low average rate, features that underlie the amount of dating information in alignments, hence statistical power. The best precision is associated with core biological functions such as ATP binding, cellular organization and anatomical development. We then investigated the accuracy of dating on simulated alignments, by controlling the three above parameters separately. It confirmed the factors of precision, but also revealed a systematic bias when branch rates are highly heterogeneous. This suggests that the relaxed log-normal clock model is not statistically consistent when calibrations are lacking and rate heterogeneity is high. Our study finally provides a general scale of parameters that influences the dating precision and accuracy, which can be generalized to other taxa. To tackle molecular dating events like gene duplications, future models should overcome the lack of power due to limited information from single genes.",

    "abstract": "The lack of information regarding the water requirement of tree species promotes water waste in the seedlings production in nurseries. Water requirement, the growth plant factors and water efficiencies for height and diameter were determined for Schizolobium parahyba (Vell.)

We used sewage sludge biosolids as substrate in the seedling phase (280 cm-3 tube), and sandy soil material in the initial pot growth phase (18 dm-3 pot). In the seedlings phase, four water replacement levels were applied to the substrate, by drip irrigation, meaning average replacement ranging from 40 (V1) to 100% (V4) of species water requirement. Seedlings developed properly and 80 days after emergency, S. parahyba, C. myrianthum and C. speciosa seedlings received, respectively, 2.40, 1.08 and 0.85 L per plant, for V4. After growth phase (230 DAE), the total water volumes were, respectively, 70.0, 50.3 and 52.7 L per plant. Under adequate water supply, there were rapid recovery and growth of the species, even for the seedlings which showed different height and diameter in the tube phase. The growth plant factors values found were below 0.5 for all species indicating low sensibility to growth, both in height and in diameter, in response to water deficit. Water efficiency indicators point to distinct trends between the two phases, and C. speciosa present higher values of water efficiencies for height (80.7 and 17.0 cm L-1) and diameter (2.1 and 0.5 mm L-1) in both phases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundA typical task in bioinformatics consists of identifying which features are associated with a target outcome of interest and building a predictive model. Automated machine learning (AutoML) systems such as the Tree-based Pipeline Optimization Tool (TPOT) constitute an appealing approach to this end. However, in biomedical data, there are often baseline characteristics of the subjects in a study or batch effects that need to be adjusted for in order to better isolate the effects of the features of interest on the target. Thus, the ability to perform covariate adjustments becomes particularly important for applications of AutoML to biomedical big data analysis.\n\nResultsWe present an approach to adjust for covariates affecting features and/or target in TPOT. Our approach is based on regressing out the covariates in a manner that avoids  leakage during the cross-validation training procedure. We then describe applications of this approach to toxicogenomics and schizophrenia gene expression data sets. The TPOT extensions discussed in this work are available at https://github.com/EpistasisLab/tpot/tree/v0.11.1-resAdj.\n\nConclusionsIn this work, we address an important need in the context of AutoML, which is particularly crucial for applications to bioinformatics and medical informatics, namely covariate adjustments. To this end we present a substantial extension of TPOT, a genetic programming based AutoML approach. We show the utility of this extension by applications to large toxicogenomics and differential gene expression data. The method is generally applicable in many other scenarios from the biomedical field.",

Both of these populations are maintained in tumors, but how they physically interact to promote metastasis is unknown. We demonstrate that these subpopulations form spatially structured heterotypic clusters that cooperate in the seeding of metastasis. We unexpectedly found that INV cells were tightly adherent to each other, and formed clusters with a rim of PRO cells. Intravital imaging demonstrated cooperation between these populations, in which the INV cells facilitated the spread of less metastatic PRO cells. We identified the TFAP2 neural crest transcription factor as a master regulator of both clustering and the PRO/INV states.

    "abstract": "Enhancing proteasome activity is a potential new therapeutic strategy to prevent the accumulation of aberrant high levels of protein that drive the pathogenesis of many diseases. Herein, we examine the use of small molecules to activate the 20S proteasome to reduce aberrant signaling by the undruggable oncoprotein c-MYC, to treat c-MYC driven oncogenesis. Overexpression of c-MYC is found in more than 50% of all human cancer but remains undruggable because of its highly dynamic intrinsically disordered 3-D conformation, which renders traditional therapeutic strategies largely ineffective. We demonstrate herein that small molecule activation of the 20S proteasome targets dysregulated intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), including c-MYC, and reduces cancer growth in vitro and in vivo models of multiple myeloma, and is even effective in bortezomib resistant cells and unresponsive patient samples. Genomic analysis of various cancer pathways showed that proteasome activation results in downregulation of many c-MYC target genes. Moreover, proteasome enhancement was well tolerated in mice and dogs. These data support the therapeutic potential of 20S proteasome activation in targeting IDP-driven proteotoxic disorders, including cancer, and demonstrate that this new therapeutic strategy is well tolerated in vivo.",

The relationships between these births-based distributions and rates, and the first derivatives of fetuses-at-risk birth and perinatal death rates were examined in order to assess how the rate of change in fetuses-at-risk rates affects gestational age distributions and births-based perinatal death rate patterns.\n\nResultsModal gestational age typically exceeded optimal gestational age because both were influenced by the peak in the first derivative of the birth rate, while optimal gestational age was additionally influenced by the point at which the first derivative of the fetuses-at-risk perinatal death rate showed a sharp increase in late gestation. The clustering and correlation between modal and optimal gestational age within cohorts, the higher perinatal death rate at optimal gestational age among higher-risk cohorts, and the symmetric left-shift in births-based gestational age-specific perinatal death rates in higher-risk cohorts explained how relative gestational age resolved the paradox of intersecting perinatal mortality curves.\n\nConclusionsChanges in the first derivative the fetuses-at-risk birth and perinatal death rates underlie several births-based perinatal phenomena and this explanation further unifies the fetuses-at-risk and births-based models of perinatal death.",

In this study, a novel allele of chromogen gene C, OrC1, from Oryza rufipongon was cloned and identified as a determinant regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis. Although OrC1 functions in purple apiculus, leaf sheath and stigma in indica background, it only promotes purple apiculus in japonica. Transcriptome analysis revealed that OrC1 regulates flavonoid biosynthesis pathway and activates a few bHLH and WD40 genes of ternary MYB-bHLH-WD40 complex in indica. Differentially expressed genes and metabolites were found in the indica and japonica backgrounds, indicating that OrC1 activated the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes OsCHI, OsF3H, OsANS, OsINS and OsANR and produced six metabolites independently. Artificial selection and domestication of C1 gene in rice occurred on the coding region in the two subspecies independently. Our results reveal the regulatory system and domestication of C1, provide new insights into MYB transcript factor involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, and show the potential of engineering anthocyanin biosynthesis in rice.\n\nAuthor summaryAccumulation of anthocyanin is a selection trait in rice domestication, whereas the mechanisms regulating the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in rice remain unresolved.

A key question is to what extent the involvement of the C1 gene can explain coloration variability of cultivated rice, where anthocyanin accumulation has been eliminated by artificial selection. Our results reveal the functional chromogen gene C from wild rice causes different coloration phenotypes, regulates various anthocyanin biosynthetic genes and produces different metabolites in indica and japonica.

Their renewal property offers exciting possibilities in reversing tissue damage caused by metabolic and degenerative changes.

A convenience sampling method was used. Knowledge and attitude scores were calculated based on answers to 28 well-structured questions. Data was analyzed using SPSS.\n\nResultsThe mean values of the answers showed that 60.2% (n=124) of the students had a good knowledge and 39.8% (n=82) had poor knowledge of stem cells. Whereas, 56.8% (n=117) expressed a positive attitude and 43.2% (n=89) expressed a negative attitude towards SCR. Independent t-test applied on knowledge score and attitude showed that the mean knowledge score of people with a positive attitude is higher i.e. 21.25 as compared to the mean knowledge score of people with negative attitude i.e. 19.21. And the difference of the means is significant at p=0.007. Thus, the attitude of students was observed to be significantly dependent on their knowledge about SCR.\n\nConclusionThe results show that medical students have baseline knowledge about SC therapy and a positive attitude towards it.

    "abstract": "Sphingolipids are a vital component of plant cellular endomembranes and carry out multiple functional and regulatory roles. Different sphingolipid species confer rigidity to the membrane structure, facilitate trafficking of secretory proteins, and initiate programmed cell death. Although the regulation of the sphingolipid pathway is yet to be uncovered, increasing evidence has pointed to orosomucoid proteins (ORMs) playing a major regulatory role and potentially interacting with a number of components in the pathway, including both enzymes and sphingolipids. However, experimental exploration of new regulatory interactions is time consuming and often infeasible. In this work, a computational approach was taken to address this challenge. A metabolic network of the sphingolipid pathway in plants was reconstructed. The steady-state rates of reactions in the network were then determined through measurements of growth and cellular composition of the different sphingolipids in Arabidopsis seedlings. The Ensemble modeling framework was modified to accurately account for activation mechanisms and subsequently used to generate sets of kinetic parameters that converge to the measured steady-state fluxes in a thermodynamically consistent manner. In addition, the framework was appended with an additional module to automate screening the parameters and to output models consistent with previously reported network responses to different perturbations. By analyzing the networks response in the presence of different combinations of regulatory mechanisms, the model captured the experimentally observed repressive effect of ORMs on SPT. Furthermore, predictions point to a second regulatory role of ORM proteins, namely as an activator of class II (or LOH1 and LOH3) ceramide synthases. This activating role was found to be modulated by the concentration of free ceramides, where an accumulation of these sphingolipid species dampened the activating effect of ORMs on ceramide synthase. The predictions pave the way for future guided experiments and have implications in engineering crops with higher biotic stress tolerance.\n\nAuthor summaryDue to their vital functional and regulatory roles in plant cells, increasing interest has gone into obtaining a complete understanding of the regulatory behavior of the sphingolipid pathway. However, the process of identifying new regulatory interactions is time consuming and often infeasible. To address this issue, ensemble modeling was used as an in silico method to test the ability of different regulatory schemes to predict all known pathway responses in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The analysis resulted in a significant reduction in the number of possible regulatory interactions. Mainly, the model predicts regulatory interactions between ceramides, ORMs, and ceramide synthases (especially class II). This framework can pave the way for biochemists to systematically identify plausible regulatory networks in understudied metabolic networks where knowledge on the underlying regulatory mechanisms is often missing. As future experimental works explore these predictions, an iterative cycle can begin wherein model predictions allow for targeted experiments which in turn generate results that can be reincorporated into the model to further increase prediction accuracy. Such a model-driven approach will significantly reduce the solution space traversed by the experimentalist.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies from us and others suggest that traditionally declarative structures (e.g., hippocampus) mediate some aspects of the encoding and consolidation of procedural memories. This evidence points to the existence of converging physiological pathways across memory systems. Here, we examined whether the coupling between slow oscillations (SO) and spindles, a mechanism well established in the consolidation of declarative memories, is relevant for the stabilization of human motor memories. To this aim, we conducted an EEG study in which we quantified various parameters of these oscillations during a night of sleep that took place immediately after learning a visuomotor adaptation task. We hypothesized that if this coupling is instrumental to motor memory consolidation then spindles locked to the active phase of a slow oscillation would predict long-term memory. We found that visuomotor adaptation increased the overall density of fast ([&ge;]12 Hz) but not slow (<12Hz) spindles during NREM3. This modulation was manifested rather locally, over the hemisphere contralateral to the trained hand. Although motor learning did not affect the density of SOs, it substantially enhanced the number of fast spindles locked to the active phase of SOs. The fact that only coupled spindles of the left hemisphere predicted long-term memory overnight, points to the precise phase relationship between these oscillations as a fundamental signature of motor memory consolidation. Our work provides evidence in favor of a common mechanism at the basis of the stabilization of declarative and non-declarative memories.\n\nSignificance StatementEver since the discovery of memory systems, the study of the mechanisms supporting the consolidation of declarative and procedural memories has progressed somewhat in parallel. In the last few years, however, this framework is starting to change. We now know that structures originally thought of as purely declarative, such as the hippocampus, participate in the consolidation of procedural tasks. Here, we show that sleep modulates the stabilization of motor memories through a mechanism involved in the consolidation of declarative memories, based on the local synchrony between fast sleep spindles and slow oscillations. The fact that only coupled -but not uncoupled- spindles of the contralateral hemisphere predicted long-term memory supports a role of this association in the consolidation of motor memories.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia, with the number of patients with this condition anticipated to exceed 50 million worldwide in the near future. Despite extensive research efforts, no effective measures are available to facilitate the prevention or treatment of AD, which is due in part to a lack of animal models able to closely replicate a human-like disease state. Here, we describe the generation of three mutant marmoset individuals in which exon 9 of PSEN1 gene product has been deleted (PSEN1-{Delta}E9). Such {Delta}E9 mutations have been reported to cause early on-set familial AD (references1-5). We used Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nuclease (TALEN) to destroy the 3 splice site of exon 9 in the marmoset PSEN1 gene. To this end, TALEN exhibits high genome-editing efficacy, generates few off-target effects, and produces minimal mosaicism. Indeed, whole genome sequencing and other analyses illustrated an absence of off-target effects and an apparent absence of mosaicism. Fibroblasts obtained from newborn marmosets exhibited uncleaved full-length presenilin 1 protein (PS1) caused by the perturbation of PS1 endoproteolysis as well as an increased ratio of A{beta}42/A{beta}40 production, a signature of familial AD pathogenesis. To our knowledge, this is the first non-human primate model of familial AD. We intend to make our marmoset model available to the research community to facilitate the global fight against AD.",

The non-selected Daweishan mini chickens showed the highest indexes of immune organs and the lowest concentrations of the plasma immune parameters C3, C4, IgA, and IgY, while the commercial Avian broiler showed the opposite results. The Daweishan mini chickens showed the highest mRNA expressions of HDP genes in small intestine followed by the semi-selected Wuding chickens. Compared with local breeds, broiler chickens showed higher mRNA expression of HDP genes in spleen, thymus, and bursa. Body weight and HDP expression levels were negatively correlated in the intestine and positively in the immune organs. These results indicated that the HDP immune regulatory roles in small intestine acted as first line of defense in innate immunity in local breeds, and as an adaptive immunity in broiler chickens. Selection was associated with the expression profiles of HDP genes in a chicken, age, and organ-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Methanogens are being members of anaerobe microbiota of the digestive tract of both human and mammals. However, the sources, modes of acquisition and dynamics of digestive tract methanogens remain poorly investigated. In this study, we aimed to expand the spectrum of animals which could be sources of methanogens for human, by exploring methanogen carriage in animals in contact with the general population or with some restricted populations; comparing the repertoire of animal methanogens with the one of human methanogens in order to question methanogens as zoonotic microorganisms. We used RT-PCR, PCR-sequencing and multispacer sequence typing to investigate the presence of methanogens in 407 fecal specimens collected from nine different mammalian species. We detected by RT-PCR, the presence of methanogen DNA in all mammals here investigated and none of the negative controls. We obtained by sequencing, seven different species of methanogens, of which three (Methanobrevibacter smithii, Methanobrevibacter millerae and Methanomassiliicoccus luminyensis) are known to be part of the methanogens present in the human digestive tract. We obtained 24 M. smithii by PCR-sequencing including 12/24 (50%) in pigs, 6/24 (25%) in dogs, 4/24 (16.66%) in cats, and 1/24 (4.16%) in both sheep and horses. Genotyping these 24 M. smithii revealed five different genotypes, all know in humans. Our results are fairly representative of the methanogen community present in the digestive tract of certain animals domesticated by humans and other future studies must be done to try to cultivate methanogens here detected by molecular biology to better understand the dynamics of methanogens in animals and also the likely acquisition of methanogens in humans through direct contact with these animals or through consumption of the meat and/or milk of certain animals, in particular cows.",

    "abstract": "With the easily available option for surgeons to soak their suture in anti-biotic irrigating solution intraoperatively in mind, this study was designed to evaluate the ability of suture soaked in bacitracin irrigating solution to inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Using standard experimental procedure, sterile suture was soaked in Bacitracin suture, and dried for 10 minutes or 6 hours, incubated for 24 h on inoculated plates, and examined for zone of inhibition around the suture. This was compared to control unsoaked suture and antimicrobial suture (AMS) currently on the market to determine if the minor intra operative procedural change of placing suture in antibiotic irrigation solution instead of on the sterile table could confer some antimicrobial activity. The study found the Bacitracin soaked suture (BSS) consistently inhibited the growth of the test organisms. For both organisms, the BSS exhibited a significantly larger zone of inhibition compared to the unsoaked control suture. However, the AMS currently on the market exhibited a larger zone of inhibition compared to the BSS. Placing sutures in a bacitracin irrigation solution intraoperatively instead of directly on the sterile table can achieve some of the in vitro antimicrobial effect seen from AMS currently on the market. This may result in reduced rates of SSIs and associated costs without major procedural change and at reduced overhead.",

    "abstract": "Herpesvirus genomes record abundant recombination. Its impact on infection remains ill-defined. When co-infecting mice by the natural olfactory route, individually incapacitated Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) mutants routinely recombined to restore normal host colonization. Lung infection rescued much less well. Murine cytomegalovirus mutants deficient in salivary gland colonization also showed rescue via the nose but not the lungs. As nose and lung infections show similar spread, efficient recombination seemed specific to olfactory entry. Rescue of replication-deficient MuHV-4 implied co-infection of the first encountered cells, and this worked also with asynchronous inoculation, suggesting that latent virus could lie in wait for later reactivation. Inhaled MuHV-4 is commonly caught on respiratory mucus, which epithelial cilia push back towards the olfactory surface, and infection was correspondingly frequent at the anterior olfactory edge. Thus olfactory entry provides a general means for herpesviruses to meet.\n\nAuthor summaryInter-strain recombination allows viruses to optimise infection in diverse hosts. Many herpesviruses show past recombination. Yet they are ancient pathogens, so this past may be remote and recombination rare. Diverse herpesviruses enter new hosts via olfactory cells. We show that such entry routinely allows recombination between co-infecting virus strains, even when one strain cannot spread. Recombination was contrastingly rare after lung infection. Thus, entry via olfactory cells specifically supports frequent herpesvirus recombination.",

    "abstract": "N-acetylneuraminic acid is the most abundant sialic acid in humans and is generally expressed as the terminal sugar on intestinal mucus glycans. Several pathogenic bacterial species harvest sialic acid from the mucus, diet, as well as other intestinal sources and display this sugar on their own surface to evade sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-type lectin (Siglec)-mediated host immune surveillance. While previous studies have identified bacterial enzymes associated with sialic acid catabolism, no reported methods permit the selective labeling, tracking, and quantitation of sialic acid-presenting microbes within complex multi-microbial systems. Here, we apply an interdisciplinary approach combining metabolic labeling, click chemistry, metagenomic, and whole-genome sequencing to selectively track and identify sialic acid-presenting microbes from a cultured healthy human fecal microbiome. We isolated and identified a new strain of Escherichia coli that incorporates sialic acid onto its own surface. Analysis of the sequence data reveals that this E. coli strain encodes for the NanT, NeuA, and NeuS genes necessary for harvesting environmental sialic acid and generating the capsular polysialic acid. We envision that this method is applicable to the detection and quantitation of sialic acid-presenting bacteria from human, animal, and environmental microbiomes, as well as investigating the importance of other carbohydrates to commensal and pathogenic bacteria.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSevere fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) causes severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and cats. Clinical symptoms of SFTS-infected cats resemble to those of SFTS patients and SFTS-contracted cats shows high levels of viral RNA loads in the serum and body fluids. Due to the risk of direct infection from SFTS-infected cats to human, it is important to diagnose SFTS-suspected animals.\n\nMethodology/Principle findingsFour primer sets were newly designed from consensus sequences constructed by 108 strains of SFTSV. A reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with these four primer sets were successfully and specifically detected several clades of SFTSV. Their limits of detection are 1-10 copies/reaction. By this RT-PCR, 5 cat cases among 56 SFTS-suspected animal cases were diagnosed as SFTS. From these cats, IgM or IgG against SFTSV were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), but not neutralizing antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization titer (PRNT) test. This phenomenon is similar to those of fatal SFTS patients.\n\nConclusion/SignificanceThis newly developed RT-PCR could detect SFTSV RNA of several clades from SFTS-suspected animals. In addition to ELISA and PRNT test, the useful laboratory diagnosis systems of SFTS-suspected animals has been made in this study.\n\nAuthor summaryThis study developed RT-PCR to detect SFTS animal cases. This assay could detect SFTSV RNA belonging to different clades. Cats diagnosed as SFTS had IgM or IgG, but not neutralizing antibodies. SFTS cat cases were distributed in the area where SFTS patients have been reported highly, indicating the establishment of the circulation of SFTSV in the environment. These diagnostic assays could be helpful tools to detect and not to miss SFTS animal cases.",

    "abstract": "Coordination between cell differentiation and proliferation during development requires the balance between asymmetric and symmetric modes of cell division. However, the cellular intrinsic cue underlying the binary choice between these two division modes remains elusive. Here we show evidence in Caenorhabditis elegans that the invariable lineage of the division modes is programmed by the balance between antagonizing complexes of partitioning-defective (PAR) proteins. By uncoupling unequal inheritance of PAR proteins from that of fate determinants during zygote division, we demonstrated that changes in the balance between PAR-2 and PAR-6 are sufficient to re-program the division modes from symmetric to asymmetric and vice versa in two-cell stage embryos. The division mode adopted occurs independently of asymmetry in cytoplasmic fate determinants, cell-size asymmetry, and cell-cycle asynchrony between the sister cells. We propose that the balance between antagonizing PAR proteins represents an intrinsic self-organizing cue for binary specification of the division modes during development.",

    "abstract": "While the international pet trade and habitat destruction have been extensively discussed as major threats to the survival of the pancake tortoise (Malacochersus tornieri), the impact of climate change on the species remains unknown. In this study, we used species distribution modelling to predict the current and future distribution of pancake tortoises in Zambezian and Somalian biogeographical regions. We used 224 pancake tortoise occurrences obtained from Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia to estimate suitable and stable areas for the pancake tortoise in all countries present in these regions. We also used a protected area network to assess how many of the suitable and stable areas are protected for the conservation of this critically endangered species. Our model predicted the expansion of climatically suitable habitats for pancake tortoises from four countries and a total area of 90,668.75 km2 to ten countries in the future and an area of 343,459.60 - 401,179.70 km2. The model also showed that a more significant area of climatically suitable habitat for the species lies outside of the wildlife protected areas. Based on our results, we can predict that pancake tortoises may not suffer from habitat constriction. However, the species will continue to be at risk from the international pet trade, as most of the identified suitable habitats remain outside of protected areas. We suggest that efforts to conserve the pancake tortoise should not only focus on protected areas but also areas that are unprotected, as these comprise a large proportion of the suitable and stable habitats available following predicted future climate change.",

A fully integrated genetic map with 4,285 single nucleotide polymorphisms, spanning 1,630 cM, was constructed with MAPpoly software. We observed that bivalent configurations were the most abundant ones (51.0[~]72.4% depending on parent and linkage group), though multivalent configurations were also observed (2.2[~]39.2%). Seven traits were evaluated over four years (2006-8 and 2014) and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping was carried out using QTLpoly software. Based on a multiple-QTL model approach, we detected 21 QTL for 15 out of 27 trait-year combination phenotypes. A hotspot on linkage group 5 was identified as QTL for maturity, plant yield, specific gravity and internal heat necrosis resistance over different years were co-located. Additional QTL for specific gravity and dry matter were detected with maturity-corrected phenotypes. Among the genes around QTL peaks, we found those on chromosome 5 that have been previously implicated in maturity (StCDF1) and tuber formation (POTH1). These analyses have the potential to provide insights into the biology and breeding of tetraploid potato and other autopolyploid species.",

This regulation enables most T-cells to express exactly one T-cell receptor isoform chosen from a large repertoire, and to react precisely against diverse antigens. Some cells express two receptor isoforms, revealing the stochastic nature of this process. A similar regulation of odorant receptors and protocadherins enable cells to recognize odors and confer individuality to cells in neuronal interaction networks, respectively. We explored whether genes in other families are expressed exclusively by analyzing single cell RNA-seq data with a simple metric. Chromosomal segments and families are more likely to express genes concurrently than exclusively, possibly due to the evolutionary and biophysical aspects of shared regulation. Nonetheless, gene families with exclusive gene choice were detected in multiple cell types, most of them are membrane proteins involved in ion transport and cell adhesion, suggesting the coordination of these two functions. Thus, stochastic exclusive expression extends beyond the prototypical families, permitting precision in gene choice to be combined with the diversity of intercellular interactions.",

    "abstract": "Oscillations of muscle force, observed as physiological tremors, rely upon the synchronized firings of active motor units (MUs). This study aimed to investigate the effects of synchronizing the firings of three types of MUs on force development using a mathematical model of the rat medial gastrocnemius muscle. The model was designed based on the actual proportion and physiological properties of MUs and motoneurons innervating the muscle. The isometric muscle and MU forces were simulated by a model predicting non-synchronized firing of a pool of 57 MUs (including eight slow, 23 fast resistant to fatigue, and 26 fast fatigable) to ascertain a maximum excitatory signal when all MUs were recruited into the contraction. The mean firing frequency of each MU depended upon the twitch contraction time, whereas the recruitment order was determined according to increasing forces (the size principle). The synchronization of firings of individual MUs was simulated using four different modes and inducing the synchronization of firings within three time windows ({+/-} 2, {+/-} 4, and {+/-} 6 ms) for four different combinations of MUs. The synchronization was estimated using two parameters, the correlation coefficient and the cross-interval synchronization index. The four scenarios of synchronization increased the values of the root-mean-square, range, and maximum force in correlation with the increase of the time window. Greater synchronization index values resulted in higher root-mean-square, range, and maximum of force outcomes for all MU types as well as for the whole muscle output; however, the mean spectral frequency of the forces decreased, whereas the mean force remained nearly unchanged. The range of variability and the root-mean-square of forces were higher for fast MUs than for slow MUs; meanwhile, the relative values of these parameters were highest for slow MUs, indicating their important contribution to muscle tremor, especially during weak contractions.\n\nAuthor summaryThe synchronization of firings of motor units (MUs), the smallest functional elements of skeletal muscle increases fluctuations in muscle force, known as physiological tremor, which can disturb high-precision movements. In this study, we adopted a recently proposed muscle model consisting of MUs of three different types (fast fatigable, fast resistant to fatigue, and slow) to study four different scenarios of MU synchronization during a steady level of excitatory input to motoneurons. The discharge patterns were synchronized between pairs of MUs by shifting in time individual pulses, which occurred within a short time interval, and a degree of synchronization was then estimated. The increased synchronization index resulted in increased force variability for all MU types as well as for the whole muscle output; however, the mean force levels remained nearly unchanged, whereas the frequencies of the force oscillations were decreased. The absolute range of force variability was higher for fast than for slow MUs, indicating their dominant influence on muscle tremor at strong contractions, but the highest relative increase in force variability was observed for synchronized slow MUs, indicating their significant contribution to tremor during weak contractions, in which only slow MUs are active.",

Many reports have described cognitive dysfunctions in HUS patients, the hippocampus being one of the brain areas targeted by EHEC infection. In this context, a translational murine model of encephalopathy was employed to establish the deleterious effects of Stx2 and the contribution of LPS in the hippocampus. Results demonstrate that systemic administration of a sublethal dose of Stx2 reduced memory index and produced depression like behavior, pro-inflammatory cytokine release and NF-kB activation independent of the ERK 1/2 signaling pathway. On the other hand, LPS activated NF-kB dependent on ERK 1/2 signaling pathway. Cotreatment of Stx2 with LPS aggravated the pathologic state, while dexamethasone treatment succeeded in preventing behavioral alterations.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly transmitted worldwide and results in the COVID-19 pandemic. Spike glycoprotein on surface is a key factor of viral transmission, and has appeared a lot of variants due to gene mutations, which may influence the viral antigenicity and vaccine efficacy. Here, we used bioinformatic tools to analyze B-cell epitopes of prototype S protein and its 9 common variants. 12 potential linear and 53 discontinuous epitopes of B-cells were predicted from the S protein prototype. Importantly, by comparing the epitope alterations between prototype and variants, we demonstrate that B-cell epitopes and antigenicity of 9 variants appear significantly different alterations. The dominant D614G variant impacts the potential epitope least, only with moderately elevated antigenicity, while the epitopes and antigenicity of some mutants(V483A, V367F, etc.) with small incidence in the population change greatly. These results suggest that the currently developed vaccines should be valid for a majority of SARS-CoV-2 infectors. This study provides a scientific basis for large-scale application of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and for taking precautions against the probable appearance of antigen escape induced by genetic variation after vaccination.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe global pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 has lasted for more than half a year and has not yet been contained. Until now there is no effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 caused disease (COVID-19). Successful vaccine development seems to be the only hope. However, this novel coronavirus belongs to the RNA virus, there is a high mutation rate in the genome, and these mutations often locate on the Spike proteins of virus, the gripper of the virus entering the cells. Vaccination induce the generation of antibodies, which block Spike protein. However, the Spike protein variants may change the recognition and binding of antibodies and make the vaccine ineffective. In this study, we predict neutralizing antibody recognition sites (B cell epitopes) of the prototype S protein of SARS-COV2, along with several common variants using bioinformatics tools. We discovered the variability in antigenicity among the mutants, for instance, in the more widespread D614G variant the change of epitope was least affected, only with slight increase of antigenicity. However, the antigenic epitopes of some mutants change greatly. These results could be of potential importance for future vaccine design and application against SARS-CoV2 variants.",

    "abstract": "Rapid asexual replication of blood stage malaria parasites is responsible for the severity of disease symptoms and fuels the production of transmission forms. That malaria parasite species coordinate their cycles of asexual replication with daily rhythms of their host was discovered in the Hippocratic era, but how and why this occurs is enigmatic. Here, we demonstrate that the Plasmodium chabaudis schedule for asexual replication can be orchestrated by a isoleucine, metabolite provided to the parasite in periodic manner due to the hosts rhythmic intake of food. First, we identify nutrients with daily rhythms in the blood that match the timing of rhythms in both host feeding and the developmental schedule of asexually replicating parasites. We hypothesise that if parasites set their own developmental schedule, they should use a time-of-day cue that is a factor they cannot generate endogenously at any time-of-day, or scavenge in a round-the-clock manner. Our large-scale metabolomics experiment reveals that only one metabolite - the amino acid isoleucine - fits these criteria. Second, further experiments reveal that parasites alter the developmental schedule of asexual stages in response to isoleucine provision and withdrawal in the manner consistent with it acting as a time-cue. Specifically, parasites respond to isoleucine loss by slowing development. This is a parasite strategy rather than the consequences of an imposed constraint, because unlike when parasites are deprived of other essential nutrients, they suffer no apparent costs in the absence of isoleucine. Overall, our data suggest parasites can use the daily rhythmicity of blood-isoleucine concentration to synchronise asexual development with the availability of isoleucine, and potentially other resources, that arrive in the blood in a periodic manner due to the hosts daily feeding-fasting cycle. Identifying both how and why parasites keep time opens avenues for interventions; interfering with the parasites time-keeping mechanism may stall replication, increasing the efficacy of drugs and immune responses, and could also prevent parasites from entering dormancy to tolerate drugs.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive sequences are ubiquitous and fast-evolving elements responsible for size variation and large-scale organization of plant genomes. Within Passiflora genus, a ten-fold variation in genome size, not attributed to polyploidy, is known. Here, we applied a combined in silico and cytological approach to study the organization and diversification of repetitive elements in three species of these genera representing its known range in genome size variation. Sequences were classified in terms of type and repetitiveness and the most abundant were mapped to chromosomes. We identified Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons as the most abundant elements in the three genomes, showing a considerable variation among species. Satellite DNAs (satDNAs) were less representative, but highly diverse between subgenera. Our results clearly confirm that the largest genome species (Passiflora quadrangularis) presents a higher accumulation of repetitive DNA sequences, specially Angela and Tekay elements, making up most of its genome. Passiflora cincinnata, with intermediate genome and from the same subgenus, showed similarity with P. quadrangularis regarding the families of repetitive DNA sequences, but in different proportions. On the other hand, Passiflora organensis, the smallest genome, from a different subgenus, presented greater diversity and the highest proportion of satDNA. Altogether, our data indicate that while large genome evolve by an accumulation of retrotransponsons, small genomes most evolved by diversification of different repeat types, particularly satDNAs.\n\nMAIN CONCLUSIONSWhile two lineages of retrotransposons were more abundant in larger Passiflora genomes, the satellitome was more diverse and abundant in the smallest genome.",

    "abstract": "Most existing tools for constructing genetic prediction models begin with the assumption that all genetic variants contribute equally towards the phenotype. However, this represents a suboptimal model for how heritability is distributed across the genome. Therefore, we develop prediction tools that allow the user to specify the heritability model. We compare individual-level data prediction tools using 14 UK Biobank phenotypes; our new tool LDAK-Bolt-Predict outperforms the existing tools Lasso, BLUP, Bolt-LMM and BayesR for all 14 phenotypes. We compare summary statistic prediction tools using 225 UK Biobank phenotypes; our new tool LDAK-BayesR-SS outperforms the existing tools lassosum, sBLUP, LDpred and SBayesR for 223 of the 225 phenotypes. The increase in prediction accuracy from improving the heritability model tends to be substantial. For example, when using LDAK-Bolt-Predict, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained increased by on average 14% (range 5-29%), equivalent to increasing the sample size by a quarter.",

    "abstract": "Effective data sharing is key to accelerating research that will improve the precision of diagnoses, efficacy of treatments and long-term survival of pediatric cancer and other childhood catastrophic diseases. We present St. Jude Cloud (https://www.stjude.cloud), a cloud-based data sharing ecosystem developed via collaboration between St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital, DNAnexus, and Microsoft, for accessing, analyzing and visualizing genomic data from >10,000 pediatric cancer patients, long-term survivors of pediatric cancer and >800 pediatric sickle cell patients. Harmonized genomic data totaling 1.25 petabyes on St. Jude Cloud include 12,104 whole genomes, 7,697 whole exomes and 2,202 transcriptomes, which are freely available to researchers worldwide. The resource is expanding rapidly with regular data uploads from St. Judes prospective clinical genomics programs, providing public access as soon as possible rather than holding data back until publication. Three interconnected apps within the St. Jude Cloud ecosystem--Genomics Platform, Pediatric Cancer Knowledgebase (PeCan) and Visualization Community--provide a unique experience for simultaneously performing advanced data analysis in the cloud and enhancing the pediatric cancer knowledgebase. We demonstrate the value of the St. Jude Cloud ecosystem through use cases that classify 48 pediatric cancer subtypes by gene expression profiling and map mutational signatures across 35 subtypes of pediatric cancer.",
