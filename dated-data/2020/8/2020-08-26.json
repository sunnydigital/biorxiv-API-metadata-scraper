    "abstract": "Early in the current pandemic, the D614G mutation arose in the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and quickly became the dominant variant globally. Mounting evidence suggests D614G enhances viral entry. Here we use a direct competition assay with single-cycle viruses to show that D614G outcompetes the wildtype. We developed a cell line with inducible ACE2 expression to confirm that D614G more efficiently enters cells with ACE2 levels spanning the different primary cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Using a new assay for crosslinking and directly extracting Spike trimers from the pseudovirus surface, we found an increase in trimerization efficiency and viral incorporation of D614G protomers. Our findings suggest that D614G increases infection of cells expressing a wide range of ACE2, and informs the mechanism underlying enhanced entry. The tools developed here can be broadly applied to study other Spike variants and SARS-CoV-2 entry, to inform functional studies of viral evolution and vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in a global pandemic and shutdown economies around the world. Sequence analysis indicates that the novel coronavirus (CoV) has an insertion of a furin cleavage site (PRRAR) in its spike protein. Absent in other group 2B CoVs, the insertion may be a key factor in the replication and virulence of SARS-CoV-2. To explore this question, we generated a SARS-CoV-2 mutant lacking the furin cleavage site ({Delta}PRRA) in the spike protein. This mutant virus replicated with faster kinetics and improved fitness in Vero E6 cells. The mutant virus also had reduced spike protein processing as compared to wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In contrast, the {Delta}PRRA had reduced replication in Calu3 cells, a human respiratory cell line, and had attenuated disease in a hamster pathogenesis model. Despite the reduced disease, the {Delta}PRRA mutant offered robust protection from SARS-CoV-2 rechallenge. Importantly, plaque reduction neutralization tests (PRNT50) with COVID-19 patient sera and monoclonal antibodies against the receptor-binding domain found a shift, with the mutant virus resulting in consistently reduced PRNT50 titers. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for the furin cleavage site insertion in SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, these findings illustrate the importance of this insertion in evaluating neutralization and other downstream SARS-CoV-2 assays.\n\nImportanceAs COVID-19 has impacted the world, understanding how SARS-CoV-2 replicates and causes virulence offers potential pathways to disrupt its disease. By removing the furin cleavage site, we demonstrate the importance of this insertion to SARS-CoV-2 replication and pathogenesis. In addition, the findings with Vero cells indicate the likelihood of cell culture adaptations in virus stocks that can influence reagent generation and interpretation of a wide range of data including neutralization and drug efficacy. Overall, our work highlights the importance of this key motif in SARS-CoV-2 infection and pathogenesis.\n\nArticle SummaryA deletion of the furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2 amplifies replication in Vero cells, but attenuates replication in respiratory cells and pathogenesis in vivo. Loss of the furin site also reduces susceptibility to neutralization in vitro.",

    "abstract": "Apoptotic extrusion is crucial in maintaining epithelial homeostasis and has implications in diseases of epithelial tissues. Current literature supports that epithelia respond to extrusion to maintain their integrity by the formation of a supracellular actomyosin ring (purse-string) in the neighbors that encompasses the dying cells. However, little is known about whether other types of actin structures could contribute to extrusion as well as how forces generated by mechanosensitive proteins in the cells are integrated. Here, we found that during extrusion, a heterogeneous actin network composed of lamellipodia protrusions and discontinuous actomyosin cables, was reorganized in the neighboring cells and was the main factor driving extrusion forwards. The early presence of basal lamellipodia protrusion participated both in basal sealing of the extrusion site and in orienting the actomyosin purse-string at the later stage of extrusion. These sequential events are essential in ensuring a successful extrusion in apicobasal direction. The co-existence of these two mechanisms is determined by the interplay between the cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesions. A theoretical model integrates the role of these cellular mechanosensitive components to explain why a dual-mode mechanism, which combined lamellipodia protrusion and purse-string contractility, leads to more efficient extrusion than a single-mode mechanism. We anticipate that our approach will be useful to provide mechanistic insight into epithelial homeostasis, morphogenetic events and tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "a) BackgroundTenacibaculum maritimum is a worldwide-distributed fish pathogen known for causing dramatic damages on a broad range of wild and farmed marine fish populations. Recently sequenced genome of T. maritimum strain NCIMB 2154T provided unprecedented information on the possible molecular mechanisms involved in virulence for this species. However, little is known on the dynamic on the infection in vivo, and information are lacking on both the intrinsic host response (gene expression) and its associated microbiome community. Here, we applied complementary omic approaches, including dual RNAseq and 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding sequencing using Nanopore and short-reads Illumina technologies to unravel the host-pathogens interplay in experimental infection system using the tropical fish Platax orbicularis as model.\n\nb) ResultsWe show that T. maritimum transcriptomic landscape during infection is characterized by an enhancement of antibiotic catalytic and glucan catalytic functions while decreasing specific sulphate assimilation process, compared to in vitro cultures. Simultaneously, fish host display a large palette of immune effectors, notably involving innate response and triggering acute inflammatory response. In addition, results suggest that fish activate adaptive immune response visible through stimulation of T-helper cells, Th17, with congruent reduction of Th2 and T-regulatory cells. Fish were however largely sensitive to infection, and less than 25% of them survived after 96hpi. These surviving fish showed no evidence of stress (cortisol levels) as well as no significant difference in microbiome diversity compared to control at the same sampling time. The presence of Tenacibaculum in resistant fish skin and the total absence of any skin lesion suggest that these fish did not escape contact with the pathogen but rather prevent the pathogen entry. In these individuals we detected the up-regulation of specific immune-related genes differentiating resistant from control at 96hpi, which suggests a possible genomic basis of resistance while no genetic variations in coding regions was reported.\n\nc) ConclusionHere we refine the interplay between common fish pathogens and host immune response during experimental infection. We further highlight key actors of defense response, pathogenicity and possible genomic bases of resistance to T. maritimum.",

    "abstract": "Protein sequences are highly dimensional and present one of the main problems for the optimization and study of sequence-structure relations. The intrinsic degeneration of protein sequences is hard to follow, but the continued discovery of new protein structures has shown that there is convergence in terms of the possible folds that proteins can adopt, such that proteins with sequence identities lower than 30% may still fold into similar structures. Given that proteins share a set of conserved structural motifs, machine-learning algorithms can play an essential role in the study of sequence-structure relations. Deep-learning neural networks are becoming an important tool in the development of new techniques, such as protein modeling and design, and they continue to gain power as new algorithms are developed and as increasing amounts of data are released every day. Here, we trained a deep-learning model based on previous recurrent neural networks to design analog protein structures using representations learning based on the evolutionary and structural information of proteins. We test the capabilities of this model by creating de novo variants of an antifungal peptide, with sequence identities of 50% or lower relative to the wild-type (WT) peptide. We show by in silico approximations, such as molecular dynamics, that the new variants and the WT peptide can successfully bind to a chitin surface with comparable relative binding energies. These results are supported by in vitro assays, where the de novo designed peptides showed antifungal activity that equaled or exceeded the WT peptide.",

    "abstract": "CYC116 is a selective Aurora kinase inhibitor that has been tested in a Phase I study in patients with advanced solid tumors. Although CYC116 has shown desirable preclinical efficacy, the potential for emergence of resistance has not been explored. We established several CYC116 resistant clones from isogenic HCT116 p53+/+ and HCT116 p53-/- cell line pairs. We also generated resistant clones towards ZM447439 (quinazoline derivative), a model Aurora inhibitor. The selected clones were 10-80 fold resistant to CYC116 and cross-resistant to other synthetic Aurora inhibitors including AZD1152, VX-680, and MLN8054. Resistant clones displayed multidrug resistant phenotypes, tested by using 13 major cytostatics. All clones were highly resistant to etoposide followed by other drugs. Interestingly, all CYC116 clones but not ZM447439 became polyploid. ZM447439, but not CYC116 induced three novel mutations in Aurora B. Leu152Ser significantly affected ZM447439 binding, but not CYC116. Gene expression studies revealed differential expression of more than 200 genes. Some of these genes expression profiles were also observed in CYC116 resistant primary tumors. Bcl-xL (BCL2L1) was found to be overexpressed in CYC116 clones and its knockdown resensitized the p53+/+ resistant clone to CYC116. Finally Bcl-xL overexpressing p53+/+ CYC116 clones were highly sensitive to navitoclax (ABT-263) compared to parent cells. The data shed light on the genetic basis for resistance to Aurora kinase inhibitors which could be used to predict clinical response, to select patients who might benefit from therapy and to suggest suitable drug combinations for a particular patient population.",

    "abstract": "Artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites have emerged and been spreading, posing a significant public health challenge. Anti-malarial drugs with novel mechanisms of action are therefore urgently needed. In this report, we exploit a \"selective starvation\" strategy by selectively inhibiting Plasmodium falciparum hexose transporter 1 (PfHT1), the sole hexose transporter in Plasmodium falciparum, over human glucose transporter 1 (hGLUT1), providing an alternative approach to fight against multidrug-resistant malaria parasites. Comparison of the crystal structures of human GLUT3 and PfHT1 bound to C3361, a PfHT1-specific moderate inhibitor, revealed an inhibitor binding-induced pocket that presented a promising druggable site. We thereby designed small-molecules to simultaneously block the orthosteric and allosteric pockets of PfHT1. Through extensive structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, the TH-PF series was identified to selectively inhibit PfHT1 over GLUT1 and potent against multiple strains of the blood-stage P. falciparum. Our findings shed light on the next-generation chemotherapeutics with a paradigm-shifting structure-based design strategy to simultaneously targeting the orthosteric and allosteric sites of a transporter.\n\nSignificance statementBlocking sugar uptake in P. falciparum by selectively inhibiting the hexose transporter PfHT1 kills the blood-stage parasites without affecting the host cells, indicating PfHT1 as a promising therapeutic target. Here, we report the development of novel small-molecule inhibitors that are selectively potent to the malaria parasites over human cell lines by simultaneously targeting the orthosteric and the allosteric binding sites of PfHT1. Our findings established the basis for the rational design of next-generation anti-malarial drugs.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the RNA-binding protein (RBPs) FUS have been genetically associated with the motoneuron disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Using both human induced pluripotent stem cells and mouse models, we found that FUS-ALS causative mutations affect the activity of two relevant RBPs with important roles in neuronal RNA metabolism: HuD/ELAVL4 and FMRP. Mechanistically, mutant FUS leads to upregulation of HuD protein levels through competition with FMRP for HuD mRNA 3UTR binding. In turn, increased HuD levels overly stabilize the transcript levels of its targets, NRN1 and GAP43. As a consequence, mutant FUS motoneurons show increased axon branching and growth upon injury, which could be rescued by dampening NRN1 levels. Since similar phenotypes have been previously described in SOD1 and TDP-43 mutant models, increased axonal growth and branching might represent broad early events in the pathogenesis of ALS.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TS) is a dominant, multisystem disorder with devastating neurological symptoms. Approximately 85% of TS patients suffer from epilepsy over their lifespan and roughly 25-50% of those patients develop Autism Spectrum Disorder (1, 2). Current seizure therapies are effective in some, but not all, and often have significant risk factors associated with their use (1, 3). Thus, there is a critical need for new medication development or drug repositioning. Herein, we leveraged proteomic signatures of epilepsy and ASD, often comorbid in TS, to utilize an in silco approach to identify new drug therapies for TS-related seizures. We have discovered that activation of L-type voltage dependent calcium channels (L-VDCC) by Bay-K8644 (BayK) in a preclinical mouse model of TS rescues the excess expression of ionotropic, AMPA-subtype glutamate (GluA) receptors. As added proof of BayK working through L-VDCC to regulate GluA levels, we found that increasing expression of alpha2delta2 (2{delta}2), an auxiliary calcium channel subunit that boosts L-VDCC surface expression, similarly lowers the surface expression of dendritic GluA in TS. These BayK-induced molecular alterations may potentially improve the quality of life of humans suffering from TS.\n\nSignificance StatementCausal mechanisms of Tuberous Sclerosis (TS)-associated neurological disorders are under-characterized and treatment options are lacking. Using a computational approach of mTOR/DJ-1 target mRNAs to predict new medications, we report that boosting L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (L-VDCC) activity in a preclinical TS mouse model that exhibits a deficit in dendritic L-VDCC activity ameliorates key molecular pathologies that are predicted to underlie seizures. Restoring the mTOR/DJ-1 pathway upstream of L-VDCC, therefore, may serve as a new therapeutic avenue to mitigate seizures and mortality in TS.",

    "abstract": "Allelic expression imbalance (AEI), quantified by the relative expression of two alleles of a gene in a diploid organism, can help explain phenotypic variations among individuals. Traditional methods detect AEI using bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data, a data type that averages out cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression across cell types. Since the patterns of AEI may vary across different cell types, it is desirable to study AEI in a cell-type-specific manner. Although this can be achieved by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it requires full-length transcript to be sequenced in single cells of a large number of individuals, which are still cost prohibitive to generate. To overcome this limitation and utilize the vast amount of existing disease relevant bulk tissue RNA-seq data, we developed BSCET, which enables the characterization of cell-type-specific AEI in bulk RNA-seq data by integrating cell type composition information inferred from a small set of scRNA-seq samples, possibly obtained from an external dataset. By modeling covariate effect, BSCET can also detect genes whose cell-type-specific AEI are associated with clinical factors. Through extensive benchmark evaluations, we show that BSCET correctly detected genes with cell-type-specific AEI and differential AEI between healthy and diseased samples using bulk RNA-seq data. BSCET also uncovered cell-type-specific AEIs that were missed in bulk data analysis when the directions of AEI are opposite in different cell types. We further applied BSCET to two pancreatic islet bulk RNA-seq datasets, and detected genes showing cell-type-specific AEI that are related to the progression of type 2 diabetes. Since bulk RNA-seq data are easily accessible, BSCET provided a convenient tool to integrate information from scRNA-seq data to gain insight on AEI with cell type resolution. Results from such analysis will advance our understanding of cell type contributions in human diseases.\n\nAuthor SummaryDetection of allelic expression imbalance (AEI), a phenomenon where the two alleles of a gene differ in their expression magnitude, is a key step towards the understanding of phenotypic variations among individuals. Existing methods detect AEI use bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data and ignore AEI variations among different cell types. Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled the characterization of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, the high costs have limited its application in AEI analysis. To overcome this limitation, we developed BSCET to characterize cell-type-specific AEI using the widely available bulk RNA-seq data by integrating cell-type composition information inferred from scRNA-seq samples. Since the degree of AEI may vary with disease phenotypes, we further extended BSCET to detect genes whose cell-type-specific AEIs are associated with clinical factors. Through extensive benchmark evaluations and analyses of two pancreatic islet bulk RNA-seq datasets, we demonstrated BSCETs ability to refine bulk-level AEI to cell-type resolution, and to identify genes whose cell-type-specific AEIs are associated with the progression of type 2 diabetes. With the vast amount of easily accessible bulk RNA-seq data, we believe BSCET will be a valuable tool for elucidating cell type contributions in human diseases.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has already killed more than 800,000 people worldwide. To gain entry, the virus uses its spike protein to bind to host hACE-2 receptors on the host cell surface and mediate fusion between viral and cell membranes. As initial steps leading to virus entry involves significant changes in protein conformation as well as in the electrostatic environment in the vicinity of the spike-hACE-2 complex, we explored the sensitivity of the interaction to changes in ionic strength through computational simulations and surface plasmon resonance. We identified two regions in the receptor-binding domain (RBD), E1 and E2, which interact differently with hACE-2. At high salt concentration, E2-mediated interactions are weakened but are compensated by strengthening E1-mediated hydrophobic interactions. These results provide a detailed molecular understanding of spike RBD/hACE-2 complex formation and stability under a wide range of ionic strengths.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=192 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/267351v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (62K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a7dc02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15d3c78org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2d09c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@db78a9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Filamentous marine cyanobacteria make a variety of bioactive molecules that are produced by polyketide synthases, non-ribosomal peptide synthetases, and hybrid pathways that are encoded by large biosynthetic gene clusters. These cyanobacterial natural products represent potential drugs leads; however, thorough pharmacological investigations have been impeded by the limited quantity of compound that is typically available from the native organisms. Additionally, investigations of the biosynthetic gene clusters and enzymatic pathways have been difficult due to the inability to conduct genetic manipulations in the native producers. Here we report a set of genetic tools for the heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 and Anabaena (Nostoc) PCC 7120. To facilitate the transfer of gene clusters in both strains, we engineered a strain of Anabaena that contains S. elongatus homologous sequences for chromosomal recombination at a neutral site and devised a CRISPR-based strategy to efficiently obtain segregated double recombinant clones of Anabaena. These genetic tools were used to express the large 28.7 kb cryptomaldamide biosynthetic gene cluster from the marine cyanobacterium Moorena (Moorea) producens JHB in both model strains. S. elongatus did not produce cryptomaldamide, however high-titer production of cryptomaldamide was obtained in Anabaena. The methods developed in this study will facilitate the heterologous expression of biosynthetic gene clusters isolated from marine cyanobacteria and complex metagenomic samples.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=110 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/267179v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@660caforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cab871org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@130de4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f50c64_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) allow for cell-specific optical recordings of membrane potential changes in defined cell populations. One tool that would further their use in the in vivo mammalian brain is transgenic reporter animals that facilitate precise and repeatable targeting with high expression levels. The present literature on the development and use of transgenic mouse lines as vehicles for GEVI expression is limited. Here we report the first in vivo experiments using a transgenic reporter mouse for the GEVI ArcLight (Ai86(TITL-ArcLight)), which utilizes a Cre/tTA dependent expression system (TIGRE 1.0). Following pairing to appropriate Cre- and tTA transgenic mice, we report two mouse lines with ArcLight expression restricted to olfactory sensory neurons (OMP-ArcLight), and a subpopulation of interneurons that include periglomerular and granule cells (Emx1-ArcLight) in the olfactory bulb (OB). The ArcLight expression in these lines was sufficient for in vivo imaging of odorant responses in single trials. Odor responses were measured in the OB using epifluorescence and 2-photon imaging. The voltage responses were odor-specific and concentration-dependent, and confirmed earlier conclusions from calcium measurements. This study shows that the ArcLight Ai86(TITL-ArcLight) transgenic line is a flexible genetic tool that can be used to record neuronal electrical activity of a variety of cell types with a signal-to-noise ratio that is comparable to previous reports using viral transduction.",

    "abstract": "Malaria incidence in Panama has plateaued in recent years in spite of elimination efforts, with almost all cases caused by Plasmodium vivax. Notwithstanding, overall malaria prevalence remains low (fewer than 1 case per 1000 persons). We used selective whole genome amplification to sequence 96 P. vivax samples from Panama collected between 2007 and 2019 to study the population structure and transmission dynamics of the parasite. Imported cases resulting from increased levels of human migration could threaten malaria elimination prospects, and four of the samples evaluated came from individuals with travel history. We explored patterns of recent common ancestry among the samples and observed that a single highly genetically related lineage was dominant among the samples (47 out of 59 samples with good sequencing coverage), spanning the entire period of the collection (2007-2019) and all regions of the country. We also found a second, smaller clonal lineage of four parasites collected between 2017 and 2019. To explore the regional context of Panamanian P. vivax we conducted principal components analysis and constructed a neighbor-joining tree using these samples and samples collected worldwide from a previous study. Three of the four samples with travel history clustered with samples collected from their suspected country of origin (consistent with importation), while one appears to have been a result of local transmission. The small number of genetically unique Panamanian P. vivax samples clustered with samples collected from Colombia, suggesting they represent the genetically similar ancestral P. vivax population in Panama or were recently imported from Colombia. The low diversity we observe in Panama indicates that this parasite population has been previously subject to a severe bottleneck and may be eligible for elimination. Additionally, while we confirmed that P. vivax is imported to Panama from diverse geographic locations, the lack of impact from imported cases on the overall parasite population genomic profile suggests that onward transmission from such cases is limited and that imported cases may not presently pose a major barrier to elimination.\n\nAuthor SummaryPanama has greatly reduced P. vivax incidence, however, this progress has plateaued. Understanding parasite transmission patterns and identifying imported cases is critical to help Panama and other countries succeed in their elimination efforts. Genomic epidemiology and population genomics can help provide information needed to inform malaria control policy. In this study, we collected 100 Panamanian P. vivax samples from two collection periods (2007-2009 and 2017-2019), of which 59 yielded usable sequencing data. 4 samples had patient travel history data associated with them. We found that the majority of samples belong to a single highly related lineage, termed CL1. This lineage has persisted since at least 2007. We also highlight how genomic epidemiology can be used to spotlight parasites that may be imported as a result of human migration, as well as corroborate or refute the country of origin as suggested by patient travel history. We observe no evidence of outcrossing between these potentially imported parasites and the local Panamanian parasite population, suggesting that imported parasites are not driving ongoing malaria transmission in Panama. The low diversity we observe in Panama indicates that this parasite population has been previously subject to a severe bottleneck and may be eligible for elimination.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a flagellated bacterium, is one of the top model organisms for studying biofilm formation. In order to elucidate the role of the bacteria flagella in biofilm formation, we developed a new tool for flagella bio-tracking. We have site-specifically labeled the bacterial flagella by incorporating an unnatural amino acid into the flagella monomer via genetic code expansion. This enabled us to label and track the bacterial flagella during biofilm maturation. Direct, live imaging revealed for the first-time presence and synthesis of flagella throughout the biofilm lifecycle. To ascertain the possible role of the flagella in the strength of a biofilm we produced a \"flagella knockout\" strain and compared its biofilm to that of the wild type strain. Results showed a one order of magnitude stronger biofilm structure in the wild type in comparison to the flagella knockout strain. This suggests a newly discovered structural role for bacterial flagella in biofilm structure, possibly acting as a scaffold. Based on our findings we suggest a new model for biofilm maturation dynamic and underscore the importance of direct evidence from within the biofilm.",

    "abstract": "Numerous factors have been identified to influence susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease severity. Cancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. We have determined the full-length SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences of cancer patients and healthcare workers (HCW; non-cancer controls) by deep sequencing and investigated the within-host viral quasispecies of each infection, quantifying intrahost genetic diversity. Naso- and oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2+ swabs from 57 cancer patients and 14 healthcare workers (HCW) from the Brazilian Cancer Institute were collected in April-May 2020. Complete genome amplification using ARTIC network V3 multiplex primers was performed followed by next-generation sequencing. Assemblies were conducted in Geneious R11, where consensus sequences were extracted and intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) were identified. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analysis was performed using PhyMLv.3.0 and lineages were classified using Pangolin and CoV-GLUE. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all but one strain belonged to clade B1.1. Four genetically linked mutations known as the globally dominant SARS-CoV-2 haplotype (C241T, C3037T, C14408T and A23403G) were found in the majority of consensus sequences. SNV signatures of previously characterized Brazilian genomes were also observed in most samples. Another 85 SNVs were found at a lower frequency (1.4-19.7%). Cancer patients displayed a significantly higher intrahost viral genetic diversity compared to HCW (p = 0.009). Intrahost genetic diversity in cancer patients was independent of SARS-CoV-2 Ct values, and was not associated with disease severity, use of corticosteroids, or use of antivirals, characteristics that could influence viral diversity. Such a feature may explain, at least in part, the more adverse outcomes to which cancer/COVID-19 patients experience.\n\nAuthor SummaryCancer patients are more prone to clinically evolve to more severe COVID-19 conditions, but the determinants of such a more severe outcome remain largely unknown. In this study, phylogenetic and variation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes from cancer patients and non-cancer healthcare workers at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute were characterized by deep sequencing. Viral genomes showed signatures characteristic of Brazilian viruses, consistent with the hypothesis of local, community transmission rather than virus importation from abroad. Despite most genomes in patients and healthcare workers belonging to the same lineage, intrahost variability was higher in cancer patients when compared to non-cancer counterparts. The intrahost genomic diversity analysis presented in our study highlights the relaxed evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in a vulnerable population of cancer patients. The high number of minor variations can result in the selection of immune escape variants, resistance to potential drugs, and/or increased pathogenicity. The impact of this higher intrahost variability over time warrants further investigation.",
