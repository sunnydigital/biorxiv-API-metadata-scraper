    "abstract": "Retinal Muller glia (MG) can act as stem-like cells to generate new neurons in both zebrafish and mice. In zebrafish, retinal regeneration is innate and robust, resulting in the replacement of lost neurons and restoration of visual function. In mice, exogenous stimulation of MG is required to reveal a dormant and, to date, limited regenerative capacity. Zebrafish studies have been key in revealing factors that promote regenerative responses in the mammalian eye. Increased understanding of how the regenerative potential of MG is regulated in zebrafish may therefore aid efforts to promote retinal repair therapeutically. Developmental signaling pathways are known to coordinate regeneration following widespread retinal cell loss. In contrast, less is known about how regeneration is regulated in the context of retinal degenerative disease, i.e., following the loss of specific retinal cell types. To address this knowledge gap, we compared transcriptomic responses underlying regeneration following targeted loss of rod photoreceptors or bipolar cells. In total, 2,531 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, with the majority being paradigm specific, including during early MG activation phases, suggesting the nature of the injury/cell loss informs the regenerative process from initiation onward. For example, early modulation of Notch signaling was implicated in the rod but not bipolar cell ablation paradigm and components of JAK/STAT signaling were implicated in both paradigms. To examine candidate gene roles in rod cell regeneration, including several immune-related factors, CRISPR/Cas9 was used to create G0 mutant larvae (i.e., \"crispants\"). Rod cell regeneration was inhibited in stat3 crispants, while mutating stat5a/b, c7b and txn accelerated rod regeneration kinetics. These data support emerging evidence that discrete responses follow from selective retinal cell loss and that the immune system plays a key role in regulating \"fate-biased\" regenerative processes.\n\nAuthor SummaryBlinding diseases are linked to the loss of specific types of neurons in the retina. In humans, this eventually leads to loss of sight. In zebrafish, however, lost retinal neurons are regenerated resulting in restored vision. Our lab has developed zebrafish models that induce the loss of disease-relevant retinal neurons, thereby allowing us to study how individual cell types are regenerated. Here, to better understand how these processes are regulated, we compared gene expression changes occurring during loss and regeneration of two different retinal cell types, rod photoreceptors and bipolar interneurons. The majority of gene changes were specific to each cell type studied, providing strong evidence that genetic programs underlying stem cell activation vary depending on the cell type lost. We also found that the immune system was implicated as a regulator of regeneration in both models, but that individual immune-related genes were more strongly associated with one of the two models. Furthermore, disrupting multiple genes involved in immune system signaling led to enhanced rod regeneration. We hope that a better understanding of how retinal cell regeneration is regulated in zebrafish will aid efforts to develop regenerative therapeutics designed to restore sight to patients who have lost their vision.",

    "abstract": "The autoimmune regulator (AIRE) protein functions as a tetramer, interacting with partner proteins to form the \"AIRE complex,\" which relieves RNA Pol II stalling in the chromatin of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs). AIRE is the primary mTEC transcriptional controller, promoting the expression of a large set of peripheral tissue antigen genes implicated in the negative selection of self-reactive thymocytes. Under normal conditions, the SIRT1 protein temporarily interacts with AIRE and deacetylates K residues of the AIRE SAND domain. Once the AIRE SAND domain is deacetylated, the binding with SIRT1 is undone, allowing the AIRE complex to proceed downstream with the RNA Pol II to the elongation phase of transcription. Considering that the in silico and in vitro binding of the AIRE SAND domain with SIRT1 provides a powerful model system for studying the dominant SAND G228W mutation mechanism, which causes the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome-1, we integrated computational molecular modeling, docking, dynamics between the whole SAND domain with SIRT1, and surface plasmon resonance using a peptide harboring the 211 to 230 residues of the SAND domain, to compare the structure and energetics of binding/release between AIRE G228 (wild-type) and W228 (mutant) SAND domain to SIRT1. We observed that the G228W mutation in the SAND domain negatively influences the AIRE-SIRT1 interaction. The disturbed interaction might cause a disruption in the binding of the AIRE SAND domain with the SIRT1 catalytic site, impairing the AIRE complex to proceed downstream with RNA Pol II.",

By reprogramming a patient\"s own cells, immunological rejection can be avoided during transplantation. For expansion and gene editing, iPSCs are grown in artificial culture for extended times. Culture affords potential danger for accumulation of genetic aberrations. To study these, two iPS cell lines were cultured and periodically analyzed using advanced optical mapping to detect and classify chromosome numerical and segmental changes that included deletions, insertions, balanced translocations and inversions. In one of the lines, a population trisomic for chromosome 12 gained dominance over a small number of passages. This appearance and dominance of the culture by chromosome 12 trisomic cells was tracked through intermediate passages by analysis of chromosome spreads. Mathematical modeling suggested that the proliferation rates of diploid versus trisomic cells could not account for the rapid dominance of the trisomic population. In addition, optical mapping revealed hundreds of structural variations distinct from those generally found within the human population. Many of these structural variants were detected in samples taken early in the culturing process and were maintained in late passage samples, while others were acquired over the course of culturing.",

Fully embracing environmental variability can improve precision and accuracy of estimates of abundance and distribution, especially when they can often be measured with lower costs. Using the example of Atlantic cod in the Scotian Shelf of the northwest Atlantic Ocean, we demonstrate the improved clarity of their historical population trends when such informative features are included. Further, the use of Bayesian spatiotemporal Conditional auto-regressive models substantially improves our ability to understand the role of ecosystem variability upon cod, even when samples are incomplete or missing. Finally, by decomposing biomass into number, weight and a Hurdle process to estimate habitat conditions, we can extract much more information on what has occurred in the past and make reasoned inference on processes.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryDeconstructing and reconstructing cod with environmental variability",

    "abstract": "Malaria is a potentially fatal infectious disease caused by the obligate intracellular parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The parasite infects human red blood cells (RBC) and derives nutrition by catabolism of hemoglobin. As amino acids are assimilated from the protein component, the toxic heme is released. Molecular heme is detoxified by rapid sequestration to physiologically insoluble hemozoin crystals within the parasites digestive vacuole (DV). Common antimalarial drugs interfere with this crystallization process, leaving the parasites vulnerable to the by-product of their own metabolism. A fundamental debate with important implications on drug mechanism regards the chemical environment of crystallization in vivo, whether aqueous or lipid. This issue had been addressed previously by cryogenic soft X-ray tomography. We employ cryo-scanning transmission electron tomography (CSTET) to probe parasite cells throughout the life cycle in a fully hydrated, vitrified state at higher resolution. During the acquisition of CSTET data, Bragg diffraction from the hemozoin provides a uniquely clear view of the crystal boundary at nanometer resolution. No intermediate medium, such as a lipid coating or shroud, could be detected surrounding the crystals. The present study describes a unique application of CSTET in the study of malaria. The findings can be extended to evaluate new drug candidates affecting hemozoin crystal growth.",

Perceptual discrimination of stimuli with overlapping features also relies on MTL, but remains relatively unexplored in this context. We assessed mnemonic discrimination in two test formats (Forced Choice, Yes/No) and perceptual discrimination of objects and scenes in 111 community-dwelling older adults at different risk status for cognitive impairment based on neuropsychological screening. We also investigated associations between performance and MTL subregion volume and thickness. The at-risk group exhibited reduced entorhinal thickness and impaired perceptual and mnemonic discrimination. Perceptual discrimination impairment partially explained group differences in mnemonic discrimination and correlated with entorhinal thickness. Executive dysfunction accounted for Yes/No deficits in at-risk adults, demonstrating the importance of test format for the interpretation of memory decline. These results suggest that perceptual discrimination tasks may be useful tools for detecting incipient cognitive impairment related to reduced MTL integrity in non-clinical populations.",

However, the dynamics of this process are difficult to characterize in dominant gut species in their complex in vivo environment.

By analyzing >400,000 lineages across four human Bacteroides strains in gnotobiotic mice, we observed positive selection on thousands of previously hidden mutations - most of which were unrelated to their original gene knockouts. The spectrum of fitness benefits varied between species, and displayed diverse tradeoffs over time and in different dietary conditions, enabling inferences of their underlying function. These results suggest that within-host adaptations arise from an intense competition between numerous contending mutations, which can strongly influence their emergent evolutionary tradeoffs.",

Tests on a range of model and non-model animal and plant genome assemblies give reliable and accurate results, in contrast to less reliable K-mer histogram methods. The problem of half-sized assemblies of duplication-rich Daphnia is addressed. A 20-year old Arabidopsis genome discrepancy is resolved in favor of 157Mb as measured with flow-cytometry.

    "abstract": "The rapid single-cell transcriptomic technology developments has led to an increasing interest in cellular heterogeneity within cell populations. Although cell-type proportions can be obtained directly from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is costly and not feasible in every study. Alternatively, with fewer experimental complications, cell-type compositions are characterized from bulk RNA-seq data. Many computational tools have been developed and reported in the literature. However, they fail to appropriately incorporate the covariance structures in both scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq datasets in use.\n\nWe present a covariance-based single-cell decomposition (CSCD) method that estimates cell-type proportions in bulk data through building a reference expression profile based on a single-cell data, and learning gene-specific bulk expression transformations using a constrained linear inverse model. The approach is similar to Bisque, a cell-type decomposition method that was recently developed. Bisque is limited to a univariate model, thus unable to incorporate gene-gene correlations into the analysis. We introduce a more advanced model that successfully incorporates the covariance structures in both scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq datasets into the analysis, and fixes the collinearity issue by utilizing a linear shrinkage estimation of the corresponding covariance matrices. We applied CSCD to several publicly available datasets and measured the performance of CSCD, Bisque and six other common methods in the literature. Our results indicate that CSCD is more accurate and comprehensive than most of the existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Unicellular microalgae are of immense ecological importance with growing commercial potential in industries such as renewable energy, food and pharmacology. Viral infections can have a profound impact on the growth and evolution of their hosts. However, very little is known of the diversity within, and effect of, unicellular microalgal RNA viruses. In addition, identifying RNA viruses in these organisms that could have originated more than a billion years ago constitutes a robust data set to dissect molecular events and address fundamental questions on virus evolution. We assessed the diversity of RNA viruses in eight microalgal cultures including representatives from the diatom, eustigmatophyte, dinoflagellate, red algae and euglenid groups. Using metatranscriptomic sequencing combined with bioinformatic approaches optimised to detect highly divergent RNA viruses, we identified ten RNA virus sequences, with nine constituting new viral species. Most of the newly identified RNA viruses belonged to the double-stranded Totiviridae, Endornaviridae and Partitiviridae, greatly expanding the reported host range for these families. Two new species belonging to the single-stranded RNA viral clade Marnaviridae, commonly associated with microalgal hosts, were also identified. This study highlights that a great diversity of RNA viruses likely exists undetected within the unicellular microalgae. It also highlights the necessity for RNA viral characterisation and to investigate the effects of viral infections on microalgal physiology, biology and growth, considering their environmental and industrial roles.\n\nImportanceIn comparison to animals or plants, our knowledge of the diversity of RNA viruses infecting microbial algae - the microalgae - is minimal. Yet describing the RNA viruses infecting these organisms is of primary importance at both the ecological and economical levels because of the fundamental roles these organisms play in aquatic environments and their growing value across a range of industrial fields. Using metatranscriptomic sequencing we aimed to reveal the RNA viruses present in cultures of eight microalgae species belonging to the diatom, dinoflagellate, eustigmatophyte, rhodophyte and euglena major clades of algae. This work identified ten new divergent RNA virus species, belonging to RNA virus families as diverse as the double-stranded Totiviridae, Endornaviridae, Partitiviridae and the single-stranded Marnaviridae. By expanding the known diversity of RNA viruses infecting unicellular eukaryotes, this study contributes to a better understanding of the early evolution of the virosphere and will inform the use of microalgae in industrial applications.",

For example, tetraphenylethene maleimide (TPE-MI) has previously been used to quantify the engagement of quality control machinery with client proteins in cell lysates. Here, we showcase the ability of TPE-MI to additionally reveal proteome network remodeling in whole cells in response to a cohort of commonly used pharmacological stimuli of varying specificity.

Through computational analyses, we identify putative mutational hotspots in DNMT1 distal from the active site that encompass mutations spanning a multi-domain autoinhibitory interface and the uncharacterized BAH2 domain. We biochemically characterize these mutations as gain-of-function mutations that increase DNMT1 activity. Extrapolating our analysis to UHRF1, we discern putative gain-of-function mutations in multiple domains, including key residues across the autoinhibitory TTD-PBR interface.

    "abstract": "Decreasing dietary intake of methionine exerts robust anti-adiposity effects in rodents but modest effects in humans. Since cysteine can be synthesized from methionine, animal diets are formulated by decreasing methionine and eliminating cysteine. Such diets exert both methionine restriction (MR) and cysteine restriction (CR), i.e., sulfur amino acid restriction (SAAR). Contrarily, human diets used in clinical studies did not eliminate cysteine and thus might have exerted only MR. Epidemiological studies positively correlate body adiposity with plasma cysteine but not with methionine, suggesting that CR, but not MR, is responsible for the antiadiposity effects of SAAR in rodents. Whether this is true, and if so, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Using multiple diets with variable concentrations of methionine and cysteine, we demonstrate that the anti-adiposity effects of SAAR are due to CR. CR increased serinogenesis (serine biosynthesis from non-glucose substrates) by diverting substrates from glyceroneogenesis, essential for fatty acid/triglyceride cycling. Molecular data suggest that the CR results in glutathione depletion, which induces Nrf2 and downstream targets Phgdh (the serine biosynthetic enzyme) and Pepck-M. Using multiple mouse models, we show that the magnitude of SAAR-induced changes in molecular markers depends on dietary fat concentration (60 fat>10% fat), gender (males>females), and age-at-onset (young>adult). Our findings are translationally relevant as we found a negative correlation of plasma serine with triglycerides and metabolic syndrome criteria in a cross-sectional epidemiological study. SAAR-like diets with high polyunsaturated fatty acids increased plasma serine in a short-term human feeding study. Serinogenesis might be a potential target to correct hypertriglyceridemia.",

    "abstract": "New protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are being identified, but PPIs have different physicochemical properties compared with conventional targets, making it difficult to use small molecules. Peptides offer a new modality to target PPIs, but designing appropriate peptide sequences by computation is challenging. Recently, AlphaFold and RosettaFold have made it possible to predict protein structures from amino acid sequences with ultra-high accuracy, enabling de novo protein design. We designed peptides likely to have PPI as the target protein using the \"binder hallucination\" protocol of AfDesign, a de novo protein design method using AlphaFold. However, the solubility of the peptides tended to be low. Therefore, we designed a solubility loss function using solubility indices for amino acids and developed a solubility-aware AfDesign binder hallucination protocol. The peptide solubility in sequences designed using the new protocol increased with the weight of the solubility loss function; moreover, they captured the characteristics of the solubility indices. Moreover, the new protocol sequences tended to have higher affinity than random or single residue substitution sequences when evaluated by docking binding affinity. Our approach shows that it is possible to design peptide sequences that can bind to the interface of PPI while controlling solubility.",

    "abstract": "ATPases Associated with diverse cellular Activities (AAA+) proteases power the maintenance of protein homeostasis by coupling ATP hydrolysis to mechanical protein unfolding, translocation, and ultimately degradation. Though ATPase activity drives a large portion of the mechanical work these molecular machines perform, how the peptidase contributes to the forceful denaturation and processive threading of substrates remains unknown. Here, using single-molecule optical trapping, we examine the mechanical activity of the Caseinolytic Peptidase P (ClpP) from Escherichia coli in the absence of a partner ATPase and in the presence of an activating small molecule acyldepsipeptide. We demonstrate that ClpP grips protein substrate under mechanical loads exceeding 40 pN, which are greater than those observed for the AAA+ unfoldase ClpX and the AAA+ protease complexes ClpXP and ClpAP. We further characterize substrate-ClpP bond lifetimes and rupture forces under varying loads. We find that the resulting slip bond behavior does not depend on ClpP peptidase activity. Additionally, we find that unloaded bond lifetimes between ClpP and protein substrate are on a timescale relevant to unfolding times (up to [~]160 s) for difficult to unfold model substrate proteins. These direct measurements of the substrate-peptidase bond under load define key properties required by AAA+ proteases to mechanically unfold and degrade protein substrates.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEEnergy-dependent proteases drive essential protein degradation to maintain cellular homeostasis and to rapidly regulate protein levels in response to changes in cellular environment. Using single-molecule optical tweezers, several studies demonstrate that the molecular process of degradation involves the mechanical unfolding and translocation of protein substrates by the ATP hydrolyzing enzyme component of these protease complexes. This study provides evidence that the chambered peptidase component of these molecular machines also contributes to the mechanical process of degradation by gripping substrate under load in a manner independent of peptide hydrolysis. Our results suggest that the peptidase actively contributes to the biophysical mechanisms underlying processive protein degradation by energy-dependent proteolytic machines.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus (Mab) is a rapidly growing multidrug-resistant species among nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Pulmonary infections caused by M. abscessus are difficult to treat and often result in an accelerated condition and premature death of immunosuppressed patients such as those with cystic fibrosis, putting them at a greater risk of other infections and increasing the urgency of developing a novel class of antibiotics. Here, we explore the use of toxin and antitoxin (TA) as an interesting and promising new class of target in a fragment-based drug-discovery approach. A de novo structure of Mab3862, an antitoxin of type 2 TA class in M. abscessus was elucidated and followed by drug discovery work. Very small molecules (fragments) are used to bind the antitoxin and then elaborated into drug-sized molecule that potentially trigger conformational change to prevent formation of toxin-antitoxin complex. Biophysical screening methods and binding-mode guidance from in silico docking were conducted. Grouping of fragments based on the binding site, creating a pharmacophore model, can facilitate further studies for rational design of inhibitors. Although targeting the TA complex for developing antibiotics is relatively novel and challenging, this could possibly open the gate for exploring it as potential drug target. Targeting one of the TA pairs might not be completely bactericidal. However, using this approach strategically with other antibiotics for synergic effect might be effective for patients with a persistence phenotype requiring prolonged therapy.",

    "abstract": "A reared colony of larval superworms (Zophobas morio) experienced the swift and unexplained death of about 90% of its population. We isolated a high-abundance virus from dead larvae and, using cryoEM, identified it as a novel densovirus, which we name Zophobas morio black wasting virus (ZmBWV). Densoviruses (DVs) are small, ssDNA viruses of the family Parvoviridae that infect protostome and deuterostome invertebrates. The vast majority of DVs have been associated with severe pathology, especially in larval stage insects. By cryoEM we resolved the high-resolution capsid structure of this new DV at 2.9 [A] resolution for the genome-packaging, infectious particles and at a resolution of 3.3 [A] in case of the empty particles, both purified directly from the infected Z. morio larvae. The capsid structure of ZmBWV provides the first insights into the capsid morphology of a structurally previously-uncharacterized genus, Blattambidensovirus. Consequently, the ZmBWV capsid harbors a unique surface morphology within the family, yet shows the T=1 icosahedral symmetry, the eight-stranded jelly roll core, as well as general features of multimer interactions previously found typical of subfamily Densovirinae. Although we have not inoculated healthy larvae with ZmBWV, on the basis of its prodigious abundance in infected larvae and the prior probability of larval pathology with viruses of this subfamily, ZmBWV is the most probable cause of the observed mass mortality event.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrediction of post-stroke outcome using the degree of subacute deficit or magnetic resonance imaging is well studied in humans. While mice are frequently used animals in preclinical stroke research, systematic analysis of outcome predictors is lacking.\n\nMethodsWe introduced heterogeneity into our study to broaden the applicability of our prediction tools. We analyzed the effect of 30, 45 and 60 minutes of arterial occlusion on the variance of stroke volumes. Next, we built a heterogeneous cohort of 215 mice using data from 15 studies that included 45 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion and various genotypes. Motor function was measured using the staircase test of skilled reaching. Phases of subacute and residual deficit were defined. Magnetic resonance images of stroke lesions were co-registered on the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas to characterize stroke topology. Different random forest prediction models that either used motor-functional deficit or imaging parameters were generated for the subacute and residual deficits.\n\nResultsVariance of stroke volumes was increased by 45 minutes of arterial occlusion compared to 60 minutes and including various genotypes. We detected both a subacute and residual motor-functional deficit after stroke and different recovery trajectories. In mice with small cortical lesions, lesion volume was the best predictor of the subacute deficit. The residual deficit was most accurately predicted by the degree of the subacute deficit. When using imaging parameters for the prediction of the residual deficit, including information about the lesion topology increased prediction accuracy. A subset of anatomical regions within the ischemic lesion had particular impact on the prediction of long-term outcome.\n\nConclusionsWe developed and validated a robust tool for the prediction of functional outcome after stroke in mice using a large heterogeneous cohort. Study design and imaging limitations are discussed. In the future, using outcome prediction can improve the design of preclinical studies and guide intervention decisions.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) represent taste through time-varying changes in their spiking activity. The predominant view is that the neural firing rate represents the sole unit of taste information. It is currently not known whether the phase of spikes relative to lick timing is used by GC neurons for taste encoding. To address this question, we recorded spiking activity from >500 single GC neurons in male and female mice permitted to freely lick to receive four liquid gustatory stimuli and water. We developed a set of data analysis tools to determine the ability of GC neurons to discriminate gustatory information and then to quantify the degree to which this information exists in the spike rate versus the spike timing or phase relative to licks. These tools include machine learning algorithms for classification of spike trains and methods from geometric shape and functional data analysis. Our results show that while GC neurons primarily encode taste information using a rate code, the timing of spikes is also an important factor in taste discrimination. A further finding is that taste discrimination using spike timing is improved when the timing of licks is considered in the analysis. That is, the interlick phase of spiking provides more information than the absolute spike timing itself. Overall, our analysis demonstrates that the ability of GC neurons to distinguish among tastes is best when spike rate and timing is interpreted relative to the timing of licks.\n\nSignificance StatementNeurons represent information from the outside world via changes in their number of action potentials (spikes) over time. This study examines how neurons in the mouse gustatory cortex (GC) encode taste information when gustatory stimuli are experienced through the active process of licking. We use electrophysiological recordings and data analysis tools to evaluate the ability of GC neurons to distinguish tastants and then to quantify the degree to which this information exists in the spike rate versus the spike timing relative to licks. We show that the neurons ability to distinguish between tastes is higher when spike rate and timing are interpreted relative to the timing of licks, indicating that the lick cycle is a key factor for taste processing.",

    "abstract": "Sex development is an intricate and crucial process in all vertebrates that ensures the continued propagation of genetic diversity within a species, and ultimately their survival. Perturbations in this process can manifest as variations/differences of sex development (VSD/DSD). Primary gonadal somatic cells - the ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) in the case of women - represent the absolute model to investigate mechanism of disease in VSDs. Collection of these cells in humans is laborious and invasive, while classical animal models fail to recapitulate the human phenotype and function. Furthermore, in patients with the most severe forms of VSD gonadal cells are totally absent. It is therefore vital to develop an alternative cell-model. In view of this, we established an efficient method to reprogram donor-derived urinary progenitor cells (UPs) and differentiate iPSCs into granulosa-like cells (GLCs). The UPs presented a less invasive and high-quality cell source, improving the clinical applicability of the model along with utilising a non-integrative reprogramming method that eliminates alteration of the original genome. This novel GLC model closely resembles human GCs in morphology and marker gene expression of GC cell-fate and essential function. These results provide the prospect to generate patient-specific personalised GC models to investigate mechanism of disease in VSDs and could improve understanding of the intricacies in female gonadal development.",

Female preference often results in strong selection on male traits that can drive rapid divergence of traits and preferences between lineages, leading to reproductive isolation. Despite this fundamental property of female mate choice, very few loci have been identified that contribute to mate choice and reproductive isolation. We used a combination of population genetics, quantitative complementation tests, and behavioral assays to demonstrate that alan shepard and Neuroglian contribute to female mate choice, and could contribute to partial reproductive isolation between populations of Drosophila melanogaster. Our study is among the first to identify genes that contribute to female mate preference in this historically important system, where female preference is an active premating barrier to reproduction. The identification of loci that are primarily known for their roles in neurodevelopment provides intriguing questions of how female mate preference evolves in populations via changes in sensory system and higher learning brain centers.",

    "abstract": "To conserve the high functional and genetic variation in hotspots such as tropical rainforests, it is essential to understand the forces driving and maintaining biodiversity. We asked to what extent environmental gradients and terrain structure affect morphological and genomic variation across the wet tropical distribution of an Australian rainbowfish, Melanotaenia splendida splendida. We used an integrative riverscape genomics and morphometrics framework to assess the influence of these factors on both putative adaptive and non-adaptive spatial divergence. We found that neutral genetic population structure was largely explainable by restricted gene flow among drainages. However, environmental associations revealed that ecological variables had a similar power to explain overall genetic variation, and greater power to explain body shape variation, than the included neutral covariables. Hydrological and thermal variables were the best environmental predictors and were correlated with traits previously linked to heritable habitat-associated dimorphism in rainbowfishes. Additionally, climate-associated genetic variation was significantly associated with morphology, supporting heritability of shape variation. These results support the inference of evolved functional differences among localities, and the importance of hydroclimate in early stages of diversification. We expect that substantial evolutionary responses will be required in tropical rainforest endemics to mitigate local fitness losses due to changing climates.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs can influence gene expression programs but lack the temporal resolution to identify the immediate regulatory events. Thus, even for the most well-studied, the early and primary targets of lncRNAs remain elusive. Here we describe a multifaceted effort to determine the primary targets of a lncRNA and the underlying temporal dynamics. Our approach combines several genetically defined loss-of and gain-of-function, rescue, and inducible lncRNA models. We further resolved gene regulatory events temporally (30 min to four days). Applying this approach, we find that the lncRNA Firre is an RNA-based transcriptional activator. These transcriptional activation events are not mediated by the epigenetic regulators PRC2, WDR5, or G9A, nor are they due to the proximal binding of the Firre lncRNA. Instead, Firre activates transcription by increasing chromatin accessibility (approximately 30 min after induction) and activating primary target genes (about an hour later). Overall, this study suggests Firre functions as an RNA-based transcriptional activator.",

In recent years, the dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) technique has been used to reveal the transient connectivity behavior of ASDs brains by clustering connectivity matrices in different states. However, the states of DFC have not been yet studied from a topological point of view. In this paper, this study was performed using global metrics of the graph and persistent homology (PH) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The PH has been recently developed in topological data analysis and deals with persistent structures of data. The structural connectivity (SC) and static FC (SFC) were also studied to better show the advantages of DFC analysis. Significant discriminative features between ASDs and typical controls (TC) were only found in states of DFC. Moreover, the best classification performance was offered by persistent homology-based metrics in two out of four states. In these two states, some networks of ASDs compared to TCs were more segregated and isolated (showing the disruption of network integration in ASDs). The results of this study demonstrated that topological analysis of DFC states could offer discriminative features which were not discriminative in SFC and SC. Also, PH metrics compared to graph global metrics can open a brighter avenue for studying ASD and finding candidate biomarkers.\n\nHighlightsO_LIStates of dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) were more informative than static FC and structural connectivity when comparing ASDs with controls.\nC_LIO_LIGlobal metrics of persistent homology (PH) in comparison to graph ones could better distinguish between ASDs and controls.\nC_LIO_LIThe PH metrics could offer the best classification performance in dynamic states where the networks of ASDs compared to controls were more segregated and isolated.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In life sciences random forests are often used to train predictive models. However, gaining any explanatory insight into the mechanics leading to a specific outcome is rather complex, which impedes the implementation of random forests into clinical practice. By simplifying a complex ensemble of decision trees to a single most representative tree, it is assumed to be possible to observe common tree structures, the importance of specific features and variable interactions. Thus, representative trees could also help to understand interactions between genetic variants. Intuitively, representative trees are those with the minimal distance to all other trees, which requires a proper definition of the distance between two trees. Thus, we developed a new tree-based distance measure, which incorporates more of the underlying tree structure than other metrics. We compared our new method with the existing metrics in an extensive simulation study and applied it to predict the age at onset based on a set of genetic risk factors in a clinical data set. In our simulation study we were able to show the advantages of our weighted splitting variable approach. Our real data application revealed that representative trees are not only able to replicate the results from a recent genome-wide association study, but also can give additional explanations of the genetic mechanisms. Finally, we implemented all compared distance measures in R and made them publicly available in the R package timbR (https://github.com/imbs-hl/timbR).",

To date, GO overrepresentation analysis has mainly been used to evaluate differentially expressed genes, but short- and long-read RNA-seq technologies now allow increasingly accurate identification of differential alternative splicing. The function of most splice isoforms remain unknown, but if acccurate predictions could be made, overrepresentation analysis could be applied to differentially spliced isoforms to assess the functional implications of alternative splicing in RNA-seq experiments. We present isopret (Isoform Interpretation), a new paradigm for isoform function prediction based on the expectation-maximization framework. isopret leverages the relationships between sequence and functional isoform similarity to infer isoform specific functions in a highly accurate fashion. This enabled us to adapt GO overrepresentation analysis, which to date has been limited to differential gene expression, to be extended to assess overrepresentation of GO annotations in differentially spliced isoforms. An analysis of 100 RNA-seq studies including investigations of development, cancer, and common disease demonstrated that expression and splicing regulate different sets of biological functions. We make isopret predictions freely available in a desktop application that can be used to analyze differential expression and splicing in any bulk RNA-seq dataset.",

Here we report abstinence from the synthetic opioid fentanyl engenders structural, functional, and molecular plasticity in nucleus accumbens neuron subtypes (MSNs) that mediate negative emotional behaviors. We show fentanyl abstinence causes dendritic atrophy and increased excitatory drive exclusive to D1-receptor containing MSNs. Using subtype specific RNAseq and Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis, we identified molecular signatures of fentanyl abstinence in MSN subtypes. We found a network of co-expressed genes downregulated selectively in D1-MSNs, and transcriptionally co-regulated by E2F1. We show targeting abstinence-induced molecular changes protects D1-MSNs from maladaptive plasticity and alleviates negative emotional behaviors after fentanyl abstinence.",

    "abstract": "Sex pheromones are key social signals in most animals. In Drosophila a dedicated olfactory channel senses a male pheromone, cis-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) that promotes female courtship while repelling males. Here we show that flies use separate cVA processing streams to extract qualitative and positional information. cVA olfactory neurons are sensitive to concentration differences in a 5 mm range around a male. Second-order projection neurons detect inter-antennal differences in cVA concentration, encoding the angular position of a male. We identify a circuit mechanism increasing left-right contrast through an interneuron which provides contralateral inhibition. At the third layer of the circuit we identify neurons with distinct response properties and sensory integration motifs. One population is selectively tuned to an approaching male with speed-dependent responses. A second population responds tonically to a males presence and controls female mating decisions. A third population integrates a male taste cue with cVA; only a simultaneous presentation of both signals promotes female mating via this pathway. Thus the olfactory system generates a range of complex percepts in discrete populations of central neurons that allow the expression of appropriate behaviors depending on context. Such separation of olfactory features resembles the mammalian what and where visual streams.\n\nHighlightsO_LIcVA male pheromone has a 5 mm signaling range, activating two parallel central pathways\nC_LIO_LIPheromone-sensing neurons have spatial receptive fields sharpened by contralateral inhibition\nC_LIO_LIPosition (where) and identity (what) are separated at the 3rd layer of cVA processing\nC_LIO_LIIntegrating taste and cVA in sexually dimorphic aSP-g controls female receptivity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Balance impairment or the loss of balance control is one of the most debilitating consequences of Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). The levels of balance impairment may not be necessarily associated with the severity level of TBI, which makes it more difficult to do the correlational analysis of the balance impairment and its neural underpinnings. Therefore, we conducted a study where we collected the neurophysiological data (EEG and EMG) during a balance control task on a computerized posturography platform in a group of 17 TBIs and 15 age-matched healthy controls. Further, to distinguish balance-impaired TBIs (BI-TBI) from non-impaired TBIs (BN-TBI), we stratified the level of balance impairment using the Berg Balance Scale, a functional outcome measure widely used in both research and clinical settings. We computed the brain functional connectivity features between different cortical regions of interest using the imaginary part of coherence in different frequency bands. These features are then studied in a mean-centered Partial Least Squares Correlation analysis, which is a data-driven framework with the advantage of handling more features than the number of samples, thus making it suitable for a small-sample study. Based on the nonparametric significance testing using permutation and bootstrap procedure, we noticed that theta-band connectivity strength in the following ROIs significantly contributed to distinguishing balance impaired from non-impaired population: left middle frontal gyrus, right precuneus, right precentral gyrus, bilateral middle occipital gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, left post-central gyrus, right paracentral lobule. The knowledge of specific neural regions associated with balance impairment helps better understand neural mechanisms of TBI-associated balance dysfunction and may guide the development of novel therapeutic strategies, including targeted noninvasive brain stimulation. Our future studies will investigate the effects of balance platform training on sensorimotor connectivity.",

After establishing a history of both sucrose and cocaine self-administration, a pretest-posttest experimental design was utilized to evaluate preference judgment, a simple form of decision-making dependent upon the integrity of frontal- striatal circuit function. During the pretest assessment, male rats exhibited a clear preference for cocaine, whereas female animals preferred sucrose. Two posttest evaluations (3 Days and 6 Weeks Post Inoculation) revealed that, independent of biological sex, inoculation with chimeric HIV (EcoHIV), but not saline, disrupted decision-making. Prominent structural alterations in frontal-striatal circuit dysfunction were evidenced by synaptodendritic alterations in pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex.

    "abstract": "Perceptual discrimination requires the ability to determine that two stimuli are different. It is well established that neuronal representations in sensory cortices (i.e. the specific neuronal activity patterns evoked by the stimuli) are essential for perceptual choice 1-4. Yet, the general principles by which those representations are compared in sensory systems remain paradoxically elusive. Indeed, the resolution of the neuronal representations is an order of magnitude more precise than the discrimination capabilities of the animals during behavioral tasks 5-9. This large discrepancy between theoretical neural resolution and actual animal discrimination threshold suggests that the integrative mechanisms leading to perceptual decision are computationally limited. To determine those computational constraints, we recorded the activity of layer 2/3 neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mice performing a Go/NoGo orientation discrimination task. We found that two oriented cues were perfectly perceived as distinct when there was no overlap between their neuronal representations. However, at the limit of discriminability, V1 activity stopped encoding for the orientation of the visual stimulus. Instead, we observed a funneling of the V1 activity toward distinct domains of the orientation representation space, likely generated by an orientation-dependent modulation of the neuronal excitability. The relative neuronal activity at those domains provided a probabilistic indication that the stimulus belonged to the Go or NoGo category. Thus, the categorical classification by V1 of the presented stimulus predicts accurately the probabilities of the animals perceptual decisions.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and its effector molecules--glucocorticoids--modulate diverse aspects of physiology in vertebrates ranging from metabolism to immune function, behavior, and circadian cycle. While the glucocorticoid receptor (nr3c1) is known to be involved in light adaptation (photoadaptation) of the retinal cells, the role of nr3c1 and other HPA axis signaling molecules in the behavioral phenotypes observed during photoadaptation have not been delineated. Therefore, we investigated locomotor adaptation to various light/dark durations using larval zebrafish that carry a mutated allele in key HPA axis receptors. First, we established baseline locomotion and compared WT and nr3c1 mutant larvae in constantly lit and dark conditions (for 12-hrs). WT larval zebrafish showed highest locomotor activity in the middle of the day and low activity during the early and later parts of the day, which was generally higher in the light. The baseline locomotion was depressed in nr3c1 mutants throughout the day in both environments with a more significant change noted in the light. Next, groups of larvae mutant in nr3c1, nr3c2 (mineralocorticoid receptor), or mc2r (melanocortin receptor type 2; adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor) along with their wildtype (WT) siblings were acclimated in the dark and underwent four cycles of dark-light illumination changes with different durations of illumination: 7.5, 6, 4, or 2 min. The nr3c1 and mc2r mutant fish showed significantly decreased locomotion during the dark phase when the illumination was provided for 4 or 2 min. However, with 4 min or longer illumination, if locomotor deficits were observed in mutant larvae, they demonstrated a \"catch-up\" phenotype with increasing locomotion during the later dark phases of the assay and ultimately reaching the swimming distances indistinguishable from their WT siblings in the assays with 7.5-min illumination. Finally, we looked at effects of light intensity, beginning with our short light exposure. A lower intensity of light failed to elicit any response even from WT fish after 1-min illumination. However, this dim light still evoked a robust response from nr3c1 mutants and their WT siblings after 7.5-min illumination. The nr3c2 mutant larvae consistently showed locomotor response similar to their WT siblings regardless of the length of the light phase. Thus, activation of the canonical HPA axis (i.e. nr3c1, mc2r) was necessary to induce a rapid locomotor adaptation following after light to dark transition with shorter light exposure times (~[&le;]4 min), but it was not needed for locomotor responses observed after longer exposure to light (~> 4 min). Moreover, the locomotor response after transitioning to dark from a short (1 min) exposure was dependent on the intensity of light, whereas the longer exposure was not. Together, these findings suggest that locomotion after longer exposure to light is not dependent on the HPA axis, suggesting that either parallel independent pathway(s) are responsible for the locomotor response in these cases or that the HPA axis facilitates a primary pathway to increase sensitivity to light exposure.",

    "abstract": "Surveying and monitoring biological invasions by plants can greatly benefit from the application of remote sensing techniques. In tropical insular enviroments however, multiple challenges makes the task difficult. Invasive species can be diverse and many, so that evaluating an overall invasion level may help to distinguish uninvaded native forests from forests invaded at various levels. Also, accessibility can limit the availability of field-based data documenting the ground truth of plant invasions. Here we present a methodological study with the doublefold objective of first estimating an overall index of invasion and level of native forest canopies and second detect two particular exotic (Cinamomum camphora, Lauraceae and Cryptomeria japonica, Taxodiaceae) planted in monospecific stands. The index of overall invasion level comprises four classes derived elsewhere from field observations and expert knowledge. A thematic map provided polygons representing monospecif plantations. Textural features of sub-regional regions of interest and polygons were derived using Haralick coefficients on co-occurrence matrices, and morphological profiles. Classification algorithms were applied to produce invasion classes (k-means) or detect target species (Support Vector Machine, SVM) based on pixels features.",

    "abstract": "Gastrointestinal nematode (GIN) infections are ubiquitous and often cause morbidity and reduced performance in livestock. Emerging anthelmintic resistance and increasing change in climate patterns require evaluation of alternatives to traditional treatment and management practices. Mathematical models of parasite transmission between hosts and the environment have contributed towards the design of appropriate control strategies in ruminants, but have yet to account for relationships between climate, infection pressure, immunity, resources, and growth. Here, we develop a new epidemiological model of GIN transmission in a herd of grazing cattle, including host tolerance (body weight and feed intake), parasite burden and acquisition of immunity, together with weather-dependent development of parasite free-living stages, and the influence of grass availability on parasite transmission. Dynamic host, parasite and environmental factors drive a variable rate of transmission. Using literature sources, the model was parametrised for Ostertagia ostertagi, the prevailing pathogenic GIN in grazing cattle populations in temperate climates. Model outputs were validated on published empirical studies from first season grazing cattle in Northern Europe. These results show satisfactory qualitative and quantitative performance of the model; they also indicate the model may approximate the dynamics of grazing systems under co-infection by O. ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora, a second GIN species common in cattle. In addition, model behaviour was explored under illustrative anthelmintic treatment strategies, considering impacts on parasitological and performance variables. The model has potential for extension to explore altered infection dynamics as a result of management and climate change, and to optimise treatment strategies accordingly. As the first mechanistic model to combine parasitic and free-living stages of GIN with host feed-intake and growth, it is well suited to predict complex system responses under non-stationary conditions. We discuss the implications, limitations and extensions of the model, and its potential to assist in the development of sustainable parasite control strategies.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LINematode control in cattle is complicated by drug resistance and climate change\nC_LIO_LIA model was developed to predict GIN epidemiology under varying conditions\nC_LIO_LIThe model incorporates cattle growth, infection and immunity, grass availability, weather\nC_LIO_LIPredictions were validated against empirical studies of GIN in N Europe\nC_LIO_LIThe model applies to Ostertagia ostertagi, and possibly to co-infecting Cooperia\nC_LI\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY https://www.lmcni.com/\n\nC_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "The {phi}C31 integrase system is widely used in Drosophila to allow transgene targeting to specific loci. Over the years, flies bearing any of more than 100 attP docking sites have been constructed. One popular docking site, termed attP40, is located close to the Nesprin-1 orthologue MSP300 and lies upstream of certain MSP300 isoforms and within the first intron of others. Here we show that attP40 causes larval muscle nuclear clustering, which is a phenotype also conferred by MSP300 mutations. We also show that flies bearing insertions within attP40 can exhibit decreased MSP300 transcript levels in third instar larvae. Finally, chromosomes carrying certain \"transgenic RNAi project\" (TRiP) insertions into attP40 can confer pupal or adult inviability, or infertility. These phenotypes do not require transcription from the insertions within attP40. These results demonstrate that attP40 and insertion derivatives act as MSP300 insertional mutations. These findings should be considered when interpreting data from attP40-bearing flies.",

    "abstract": "The goal of this study was to test the role cellular senescence plays in the increase in inflammation, chronic liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma, which are seen in mice null for Cu/Zn-Superoxide dismutase (Sod1KO). To inhibit senescence, six-month-old wildtype (WT) and Sod1KO mice were given the senolytics, dasatinib and quercetin (D+Q) for seven months. D+Q treatment reduced the expression of p16 in the livers of Sod1KO mice to WT levels as well as the expression of several SASP (senescence associated secretory phenotype) factors (IL-6, IL-1{beta}, CXCL-1, and GDF-15). D+Q treatment also reduced markers of inflammation in livers of the Sod1KO mice, e.g., cytokines, chemokines, macropthage levels, and Kupffer cell clusters. D+Q treatment had no effect on various markers of liver fibrosis in the Sod1KO mice but reduced the expression of genes involved in liver cancer (Myc, Tgfbr2, Socs3, and Cdkn2a) as well as dramatically reducing the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. Surprisingly, D+Q also reduced markers of necroptosis (phosphorylated and oligomerized MLKL) in the Sod1KO mice to WT levels. We also found that inhibiting necroptosis in the Sod1KO mice with necrostatin-1s reduced the markers of cellular senescence (p16, p21, and p53). The data from our study suggest that an interaction occurs between cellular senescence and necroptosis in the liver of Sod1KO mice. We propose that these two cell fates interact through a positive feedback loop resulting in a cycle amplifying both cellular senescence and necroptosis leading to inflammaging and age-associated pathology in the Sod1KO mice.",

    "abstract": "Antioxidant intervention is considered to inhibit reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviates hyperglycemia. Paradoxically, moderate exercise can produce ROS to improve diabetes. The exact redox mechanism of these two different approaches remains largely unclear. Here, by comparing exercise and antioxidants intervention on type 2 diabetic rats, we found moderate exercise upregulated compensatory antioxidant capability and reached a higher level of redox balance in the liver. In contrast, antioxidant intervention achieved a low-level redox balance by inhibiting oxidative stress. Both of these two interventions could promote glycolysis and aerobic oxidation mediated by hepatic AMPK activation, ameliorating diabetes. During exercise, different levels of ROS generated by exercise have differential regulations on the activity and expression of hepatic AMPK. Moderate exercise-derived ROS promoted hepatic AMPK glutathionylation activation. However, excess exercise increased oxidative damage, and inhibited the activity and expression of AMPK. Overall, our results illustrate that both exercise and antioxidant intervention improve blood glucose in diabetes by promoting redox balance, despite the levels of redox balance are different. Moreover, the activation and expression of AMPK could act as a biomarker to reflect the effective treatment range for diabetes. This finding provides theoretical evidence for the precise regulation of diabetes by antioxidants and exercise.",

To further aid in interpreting unannotated spectra, we created a nearest neighbor suspect spectral library, consisting of 87,916 annotated MS/MS spectra derived from hundreds of millions of public MS/MS spectra. Annotations were propagated based on structural relationships to reference molecules using MS/MS-based spectrum alignment. We demonstrate the broad relevance of the nearest neighbor suspect spectral library through representative examples of propagation-based annotation of acylcarnitines, bacterial and plant natural products, and drug metabolism. Our results also highlight how the library can help to better understand an Alzheimer's brain phenotype.

Nonetheless, it is still a challenge to identify cellular phenotypic changes caused by chemical or genetic treatments and to elucidate the relationships among treatments in an unsupervised manner, due to the large data volume, high phenotypic complexity and the presence of a priori unknown phenotypes. Here we benchmarked five deep neural network methods and two feature engineering methods on a well-characterized public data set. In contrast to previous benchmarking efforts, the manual annotations were not provided to the methods, but rather used as evaluation criteria afterwards. The seven methods individually performed feature extraction or representation learning from cellular images, and were consistently evaluated for downstream phenotype prediction and clustering tasks. We identified the strengths of individual methods across evaluation metrics, and further examined the biological concepts of features automatically learned by deep neural networks.",

    "abstract": "The NRF2 pathway is frequently activated in various cancer types, yet a comprehensive analysis of its effects across different malignancies is currently lacking. We developed a robust NRF2 activity metric and utilized it to conduct a pan-cancer wide analysis of oncogenic NRF2 signaling. We identified a distinct immunoevasive phenotype where high NRF2 activity is associated with low interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}), HLA-I expression and T-cell infiltration spanning non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and squamous malignancies of head and neck area, cervix and esophagus. In squamous cell cancers, NRF2 overactive tumors comprise a molecular phenotype with SOX2/TP63 amplification, TP53 mutation and CDKN2A loss. These immune-cold NRF2 hyperactive diseases are associated with upregulation of immunomodulatory NAMPT, WNT5A, SPP1, SLC7A11 and SLC2A1 that represent candidate NRF2 target genes, suggesting direct modulation of the tumor immune milieu. Based on single-cell mRNA data, coupled with a priori information on intercellular ligand-receptor interactions, cancer cells of this subtype exhibit decreased expression of IFN{gamma} responsive ligands, and increased expression of immunosuppressive ligands NAMPT, SPP1 and WNT5A that mediate signaling in intercellular crosstalk. As we observed differential cytokine mRNA expression with IFN{gamma} treatment in NSCLC adenocarcinoma subtype, we explored the cytokine secretome in vitro. We found that secreted neutrophil chemoattractants interleukin-8 (CXCL8) and ENA-78 (CXCL5) are elevated in NRF2 overactive cells, suggesting contribution of immunosuppressive neutrophils in NRF2 driven immune escape. Importantly, as overactive NRF2 is associated with immune-cold characteristics, our results highlight the utility of NRF2 pathway activation as a putative biomarker for stratifying immune-checkpoint blockade responders and non-responders across NSCLC and squamous cancers.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=166 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/489654v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f45782org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d40d0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a31a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1418220_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

As recently reported, chromatin modification can change nuclear morphology. Therefore, we screened a range of pharmacological chemical compounds that impact the activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes, in order to get a clue of the specific types of chromatin-modifying enzymes that remarkably effect nuclear size and shape. We found that interrupted activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes is associated with nuclear shape abnormalities. Furthermore, the activity of chromatin-modifying enzymes perturbs cell fate determination in cellular maintenance and lineage commitment. Our results indicated that chromatin-modifying enzyme regulates cell fate decision during lineage differentiation and is associate with nuclear size alteration.\n\nSignificanceHere we described for the first time the modulation of chromatin-modifying enzymes remarkably effects nuclear shape, and perturbs cell fate determination in cellular maintenance and lineage fate commitment in normal stem cells and leukemia cancer cells. We found that the irregularities of nuclear contour were highly related to pharmacological inhibition of chromatin-modifying enzyme activity. After manipulating a histone demethylase named GASC1, we found that upregulation of GASC1 impairs the differentiation of hESCs to terminally differentiated neural cells. Moreover, upregulation of GASC1 impairs the proliferation of leukemia cells due to cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and indicates misshapen nuclei. This study suggested that chromatin-modifying enzyme regulates the nuclear contour related cell fate decision also including cancer cell fate determination.",

These two physiological factor greatly affect wheat phenology. Using molecular markers, a panel of 61 diverse bread wheat varieties were genotyped for VRN-1 and PPD-1 alleles, and the traits were evaluated under autumn and spring sowing conditions to investigate the impact of the alleles and their combinations on phenological stage, morphological traits, and yield traits. The results revealed that the earlier heading (HD), and flowering (FD) conferred by insensitive alleles for VRN-1 and PPD-1 genes was consistent regardless of the variation under the two sowing conditions. The effects of a single dominant allele of VRN-1 were similar, with an additive effects when combined. The effects of a single PPD-1 insensitive allele differed, with Ppd-D1a stronger than Ppd-B1a, and Ppd-A1a was the least, with an additive effects when combined. Secondly, varieties sown under spring condition recorded a larger flag leaf area when compared to those sown under autumn condition regardless of the single and combined influence at the VRN-1 and PPD-1 loci. When compared to other genes, PPD-D1 had a consistent and significant effect on flag leaf area, spike length, and plant height across both sowing conditions. Furthermore, the sensitive allele Ppd-D1b had larger biomass across both sowing conditions, but this did not translate into increased yield because the Ppd-D1a insensitive allele recorded higher yield. The impact of PPD-D1 gene on grain yield was evident across both sowing conditions. Overall, according to the findings of this study, VRN-1 and PPD-1 genes impact in modulating phenology stages, morphological, spike and yield traits was dependent on the sowing conditions and also on genetic background with the spring and insensitive alleles poised to be favored for selection.",

By modulating DEK levels in EC neurons in vitro and in vivo, we first validate the accuracy and cell-type specificity of our network predictions.

    "abstract": "Metamorphosis of holometabolous insects is predominantly a motionless stage, when no active feeding is observed and the body is enclosed into the pupa. These physiological properties as well as undergoing processes resemble embryogenesis since at the pupal stage organs and systems of the imago are formed. Therefore recapitulation of the embryonic expression program during pupa development could be hypothesized. To assess this hypothesis at the transcriptome level, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the developmental datasets available in the public domain. Indeed, for most datasets, the pupal gene expression resembles the embryonic rather than the larval pattern, interrupting gradual changes of the transcriptome. Moreover, changes in the transcriptome profile during the pupa-to-imago transition are positively correlated with those at the embryo-to-larvae transition, suggesting that similar expression programs are activated. Gene sets that change their expression level during the larval stage and revert it to the embryonic-like state during the metamorphosis are enriched with genes associated with metabolism and development.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes is a major chronic disease with an excessive healthcare burden on society1. A coding variant (p.Arg192His) in the transcription factor PAX4 is uniquely and reproducibly associated with an altered risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in East Asian populations2-7, whilst rare PAX4 alleles have been proposed to cause monogenic diabetes8. In mice, Pax4 is essential for beta cell formation but neither the role of diabetes-associated variants in PAX4 nor PAX4 itself on human beta cell development and/or function are known. Here, we demonstrate that non-diabetic carriers of either the PAX4 p.Arg192His or a newly identified p.Tyr186X allele exhibit decreased pancreatic beta cell function. In the human beta cell model, EndoC-{beta}H1, PAX4 knockdown led to impaired insulin secretion, reduced total insulin content, and altered hormone gene expression. Deletion of PAX4 in isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived beta-like cells resulted in derepression of alpha cell gene expression whilst in vitro differentiation of hiPSCs from carriers of PAX4 p.His192 and p.X186 alleles exhibited increased polyhormonal endocrine cell formation and reduced insulin content. In silico and in vitro studies showed that these PAX4 alleles cause either reduced PAX4 expression or function. Correction of the diabetes-associated PAX4 alleles reversed these phenotypic changes. Together, we demonstrate the role of PAX4 in human endocrine cell development, beta cell function, and its contribution to T2D-risk.",

    "abstract": "Recent empirical and theoretical studies suggest that personality and locomotory performance traits are crucial components of the dispersal syndromes, and that they can evolve during a dispersal process. Island colonisation is one the best characterized processes in dispersal biogeography, and its implication in the evolution of phenotypic traits has been investigated over a wide range of temporal scales. However, the effect of island colonization on personality and performance traits of natural populations has been little explored, and no studies have addressed these processes in the context of late-Pleistocene range expansions. Here, we investigated the contribution of island colonisations triggered by post-glacial range expansions to intraspecific variation in personality and locomotory performance traits. We compared boldness, exploration, jumping performance, and stickiness abilities, in three equidistant populations of the Tyrrhenian tree frog Hyla sarda, two from the source area and one from the colonised island. Individuals from the colonised population were significantly bolder than individuals from the source area, as they emerged sooner from a shelter (p=0.028), while individuals from the source area showed markedly higher jumping and stickiness performance (both p<0.001). We discuss these results in the context of the major microevolutionary processes at play during range expansion, including selection, spatial sorting, and founder effects. However, irrespective of the processes contributing the most, our results clearly indicate that late Pleistocene climatic changes have had major consequences not just on species range dynamics, but also on the spatial patterns of phenotypic variation within species, including personality and locomotory traits variation.",

    "abstract": "Aligning single-molecule sequencing (SMS) reads to a reference genome has been computationally challenging due to the high sequencing error rates in this technology. Short distances between consecutive errors in SMS reads confront finding seeds, subsequences of the reads with exact matches to the reference, that specifically target a unique genomic position. To overcome this issue, one can look for similarities, rather than exact matches. MinHash, a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme, measures the similarity of two sequences by listing all k-mers of each one and approximating the fraction of common k-mers between them using a family of hash functions, which usually includes hundreds to thousands of different hash functions in order to increase the measurement accuracy. MinHash is used to address various bioinformatics problems, including the assembly of SMS reads. Here, we enhance both the efficiency and accuracy of the MinHash scheme by algorithmic techniques. We use a single hash function, rather than hundreds or thousands of different hash functions as used in the other MinHash-based algorithms, without losing the accuracy. We also double the size of the seed sequences by allowing one sequencing error of any form inside a pair of k-mers, which has a significant impact on the accuracy. We show algorithm, called Aryana-LoR, outperforms the accuracy of the other existing SMS aligners in both E-coli and Human genomes.\n\nAvailabilityAryana-LoR is freely available at https://gitlab.com/hnikaein/aryana-LoR",

Recent evidence has shown that Rho-based peptide vaccines have favourable outcomes in prostate cancer patients, by bringing about activation of CD4+ T-cells. Antigen presentation on the surface of cells is brought about by the MHC-I/MHC-II complex. This work provides conclusive evidence to show that the seemingly cytosolic protein, RhoC, is in fact, present on the surface of tumour cells.

    "abstract": "CTCF is required for three-dimensional chromatin organization and a predominant insulator protein. However, its roles in insulating enhancers have not been fully explained in 3D nuclear organization. Here, we found that the CTCF DNA binding domain (DBD) forms dynamic self-interacting clusters. We next investigated the spatial relationships between these clusters and other transcription regulators with a light-induced imaging system. Strikingly, CTCF DBD clusters were found to incorporate other insulator proteins but are not coenriched with transcriptional activators in the nucleus. This property is not observed in other domains of CTCF or the DBDs of other transcription factors. Moreover, endogenous CTCF shows a phenotype consistent with the DBD by forming small protein clusters and interacts less transcriptional activators bound, CTCF motif arrays. Our results reveal an interesting phenomenon that CTCF DBD interacts with insulator proteins and selectively localizes to nuclear positions with lower concentrations of transcriptional activators, providing new insights into the insulation function of CTCF.",

    "abstract": "The spinal cord and its interactions with the brain are fundamental for movement control and somatosensation. However, brain and spinal cord electrophysiology in humans have largely been treated as distinct enterprises, in part due to the relative inaccessibility of the spinal cord. Consequently, there is a dearth of knowledge on human spinal electrophysiology, including the multiple pathologies of the central nervous system that affect the spinal cord as well as the brain. Here we exploit recent advances in the development of wearable optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) which can be flexibly arranged to provide coverage of both the spinal cord and the brain concurrently in unconstrained environments. Our system for magnetospinoencephalography (MSEG) measures both spinal and cortical signals simultaneously by employing a custom-made spinal scanning cast. We evidence the utility of such a system by recording simultaneous spinal and cortical evoked responses to median nerve stimulation, demonstrating the novel ability for concurrent non-invasive millisecond imaging of brain and spinal cord.",

    "abstract": "Understanding life is arguably among the most complex scientific problems faced in modern research. From a physics perspective, living systems are complex dynamic entities that operate far from thermodynamic equilibrium.1-3 This active, non-equilibrium behaviour, with its constant hunger for energy, allows life to overcome the ever dispersing forces of entropy, and drives cellular organisation.4, 5 Unfortunately, most analysis methods provided by the toolbox of statistical mechanics cannot be used in such non-equilibrium situations, forcing researchers to use sophisticated and often invasive approaches to study the mechanistic processes inside living organisms. Here we introduce a new observable coined the mean back relaxation. Based on three-point probabilities, and exploiting Onsagers regression hypothesis, it extracts additional information from passively observed trajectories compared to classical observables such as the mean squared displacement. We mathematically prove that the mean back relaxation is able to detect broken detailed balance in systems confined in stationary or actively diffusing potentials. We show in experiment and theory that it gives access to the non-equilibrium generating energy and the viscoelastic material properties of a well controlled artificial system, and we experimentally demonstrate that it does so even for a variety of living systems, revealing an astonishing relation between the mean back relaxation and the active mechanical energy. Based on these findings, we conclude that it acts as a new marker of non-equilibrium dynamics. Combining, in a next step, passive fluctuations with the extracted active energy allows to overcome a fundamental barrier in the study of living systems; it gives access to the viscoelastic material properties from passive measurements.",

Current individualized models of brain functional organization are based on brain regions and networks, limiting their use in studying fine-grained vertex-level differences. In this work, we present the Individualized Neural Tuning (INT) model, a fine-grained individualized model of brain functional organization. The INT model is designed to have vertex-level granularity, to capture both representational and topographic differences, and to model stimulus-general neural tuning. Through a series of analyses, we demonstrate that (a) our INT model provides a reliable individualized measure of fine-grained brain functional organization, (b) it accurately predicts individualized brain response patterns to new stimuli, and (c) it requires only 10-20 minutes of data for good performance. The high reliability, specificity, precision, and generalizability of our INT model affords new opportunities for building brain-based biomarkers based on naturalistic neuroimaging paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is a common feature of inflammation-driven cancers, and promotes genomic instability and aggressive tumour phenotypes. It is known that oxidative stress transiently modulates gene expression through the oxidation of transcription factors and associated regulatory proteins. Activated neutrophils produce hypochlorous acid and chloramines that can disrupt DNA methylation via methionine oxidation. The goal of the current study was to determine whether chloramine exposure results in sequence-specific modifications in DNA methylation that enable long-term alterations in transcriptional output. Proliferating Jurkat T-lymphoma cells were exposed to sublethal doses of glycine chloramine and differential methylation patterns were compared using Illumina EPIC 850K bead chip arrays. There was a substantial genome-wide decrease in methylation four hours after exposure that correlated with altered RNA expression for 24 and 48 hours, indicating sustained impacts on exposed cells. A large proportion of the most significant differentially methylated CpG sites were situated towards chromosomal ends, suggesting that these regions are most susceptible to inhibition of maintenance DNA methylation. This may contribute to epigenetic instability of chromosomal ends in rapidly dividing cells, with potential implications for the regulation of telomere length and cellular longevity.",

    "abstract": "Renin expression follows vascular development through the mouse kidney, regressing to glomerular poles by about P10, where renin is stored in dense core granules in juxtaglomerular cells. Homeostatic challenge to blood pressure causes release of active renin from the granules and recruitment of the renin lineage cells. We investigated the response to homeostatic challenge during late fetal development and following birth in a transgenic line expressing GFP under the renin promotor. Pregnant females were treated with water or captopril (30mg/kg/day), which inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme, from E15.5. We found an increase in renin transcription and expression by P1 following captopril treatment, with granulation increased at the glomerular poles and major arteries from E18.5. At P1, the granules showed a wide variation in electron density. Notably, rough endoplasmic reticulum was expanded in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) of captopril-treated pups at both time-points suggesting increased transcriptional activity. Paracrystalline material was observed in granules of captopril treated fetuses at E18.5 and in both treated and untreated pups at P1. Renin expression and some granules were confirmed in the kidney VSMCs by immuno-gold staining against GFP at E18.5. Importantly, we found no difference in active renin content between kidneys from treated and untreated pups at either age group. We therefore demonstrate a disconnect between granulation and active renin production in newborns when exposed to homeostatic challenge in utero.",

    "abstract": "Experimental characterization of RNA structure remains difficult, especially for non-coding RNAs that are critical to many cellular activities. We developed DeepFoldRNA to predict RNA structures from sequence alone by coupling deep self-attention neural networks with gradient-based folding simulations. The method was tested on two independent benchmark datasets from Rfam families and RNA-Puzzle experiments, where DeepFoldRNA constructed models with an average RMSD=2.69 [A] and TM-score=0.743, which outperformed state-of-the-art methods and the best models submitted from the RNA-Puzzles community by a large margin. On average, DeepFoldRNA required ~1 minute to fold medium-sized RNAs, which was ~350-4000 times faster than the leading Monte Carlo simulation approaches. These results demonstrate the major advantage of advanced deep learning techniques to learn more accurate information from evolutionary profiles than knowledge-based potentials derived from simple statistics of the PDB library. The high speed and accuracy of the developed method should enable large-scale atomic-level RNA structure modeling applications.",
