    "abstract": "Salivary gland acinar cells are severely depleted after radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, leading to loss of saliva and extensive oro-digestive complications. With no regenerative therapies available, organ dysfunction is irreversible. Here using the adult murine system, we demonstrate radiation-damaged salivary glands can be functionally regenerated via sustained delivery of the neurogenic muscarinic receptor agonist, cevimeline. We show that endogenous gland repair coincides with increased nerve activity and acinar cell division that is limited to the first week post-radiation, with extensive acinar cell degeneration, dysfunction and cholinergic denervation occurring thereafter. However, we discovered that mimicking cholinergic muscarinic input via sustained local delivery of a cevimeline-alginate hydrogel was sufficient to regenerate innervated acini and retain physiological saliva secretion at non-irradiated levels over the long-term (> 3 months). Thus, we reveal a novel regenerative approach for restoring epithelial organ structure and function that has significant implications for human patients.\n\nTeaserNovel application of an injectable neurogenic-based hydrogel for restoring the structure and function of radiation-damaged tissue.",

    "abstract": "The most abundant endocannabinoid (eCB) in the brain, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), is hydrolyzed by /{beta}-hydrolase domain containing 6 (ABHD6); yet how ABHD6 controls stimuli-dependent increases in 2-AG production is unknown. To explore this question, we leveraged the recently developed 2-AG sensor, GRABeCB2.0, and found that stimulation of Neuro2a cells in culture with bradykinin (BK) acting at metabotropic B2K receptors and ATP acting at ionotropic P2X7 receptors led to differential increases in 2-AG levels. B2K triggered increases in 2-AG levels via diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL), and this mechanism was potentiated by increases in intracellular calcium and ABHD6 inhibition. By contrast, P2X7-triggered increases in 2-AG levels were dependent on DAGL and extracellular calcium but unaffected by ABHD6 inhibition. Thus, ABHD6 preferentially regulates metabotropic-dependent increases in 2-AG levels over ionotropic-dependent increases in 2-AG levels. Our study indicates that ABHD6 selectively controls stimuli-dependent increases in 2-AG production and emphasizes its specific role in eCB signaling.",

    "abstract": "The Bogong moth Agrotis infusa is well known for its remarkable annual round-trip migration from its breeding grounds across eastern Australia to its aestivation sites in the Australian Alps, to which it provides an important annual influx of nutrients. Over recent years, we have benefited from a growing understanding of the navigational abilities of the Bogong moth. Meanwhile, the population of Bogong moths has been shrinking. Recently, the ecologically and culturally important Bogong moth was listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List, and the establishment of a program for long-term monitoring of its population has been identified as critical for its conservation. Here, we present the results of two years of monitoring of the Bogong moth population in the Australian Alps using a recently developed method for automated monitoring of flying insects, named Camfi. We found that the evening flights of Bogong moths occur throughout summer, and are modulated by daily weather factors. We present a simple heuristic model of the arrival to and departure from aestivation sites by Bogong moths, and confirm results obtained from fox-scat surveys which found that aestivating Bogong moths occupy higher elevations as the summer progresses. We also present the first recorded observations of the impact of bushfire smoke on aestivating Bogong moths. We observed a dramatic reduction in the size of a cluster of aestivating Bogong moths during the fire, and evidence of a large departure from the fire-affected area the day after the fire. Our results highlight the challenges of monitoring Bogong moths in the wild, and support the continued use of automated camera-based methods for that purpose.",

    "abstract": "The recent development of continuous paleoclimatic reconstructions covering hundreds of thousands of years paved the way to a large number of studies from disciplines ranging from paleoecology to linguistics, from archaeology to conservation and from population genetics to human evolution. Unfortunately, such climatic data can be challenging to extract and analyze for scholars unfamiliar with such specific climatic file formats.\n\nHere we present pastclim, an R package facilitating the access and use of two sets of paleoclimatic reconstructions covering respectively the last 120,000 and 800,000 years. The package contains a set of functions allowing to quickly and easily recover the climate for the whole world or specific areas for time periods of interest, extract data from locations scattered in space and/or time, retrieve time series from individual sites, and easily manage the ice or land coverage.\n\nThe package can easily be adapted to paleoclimatic reconstructions different from the ones already included, offering a handy platform to include the climate of the past into existing analyses and pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Rust fungi are characterized by large genomes with high repeat content and have two haploid nuclei in most life stages, which makes achieving high-quality genome assemblies challenging. Here, we described a pipeline using HiFi reads and Hi-C data to assemble a gigabase-sized fungal pathogen, Puccinia polysora f.sp. zeae, to haplotype-phased and chromosome-scale. The final assembled genome is 1.71 Gbp, with ~850 Mbp and 18 chromosomes in each haplotype, being currently one of the two giga-scale fungi assembled to chromosome level. Transcript-based annotation identified 47,512 genes for dikaryotic genome with a similar number for each haplotype. A high level of interhaplotype variation was found with 10% haplotype-specific BUSCO genes, 5.8 SNPs/kbp and structural variation accounting for 3% of the genome size. The P. polysora genome displayed over 85% repeat contents, with genome-size expansion and copy number increasing of species-specific orthogroups. Interestingly, these features did not affect overall synteny with other Puccinia species having smaller genomes. Fine-time-point transcriptomics revealed seven clusters of co-expressed secreted proteins that are conserved between two haplotypes. The fact that candidate effectors interspersed with all genes indicated the absence of a \"two-speed genome\" evolution in P. polysora. Genome resequencing of 79 additional isolates revealed a clonal population structure of P. polysora in China with low geographic differentiation. Nevertheless, a minor population differentiated from the major population by having mutations on secreted proteins including AvrRppC, indicating the ongoing virulence to evade recognition by RppC, a major resistance gene in Chinese corn cultivars. The high-quality assembly provides valuable genomic resources for future studies on disease management and the evolution of P. polysora.",

    "abstract": "In the study of the brain, large and high-density microelectrode arrays have been widely used to study the behavior of neurotransmission. CMOS technology has facilitated these devices by enabling the integration of high-performance amplifiers directly on-chip. Usually, these large arrays measure only the voltage spikes resulting from action potentials traveling along firing neuronal cells. However, at synapses, communication between neurons occurs by the release of neurotransmitters, which cannot be measured on typical CMOS electrophysiology devices. Development of electrochemical amplifiers has resulted in the measurement of neurotransmitter exocytosis down to the level of a single vesicle. To effectively monitor the complete picture of neurotransmission, measurement of both action potentials and neurotransmitter activity is needed. Current efforts have not resulted in a device that is capable of the simultaneous measurement of action potential and neurotransmitter release at the same spatiotemporal resolution needed for a comprehensive study of neurotransmission. In this paper, we present a true dual-mode CMOS device that fully integrates 256-ch electrophysiology amplifiers and 256-ch electrochemical amplifiers, along with an on-chip 512 electrode microelectrode array capable of simultaneous measurement from all 512 channels. Electrochemical amplifiers achieve a noise level of 4.51 pARMS with a bandwidth of 10.3 kHz. Electrophysiology amplifiers exhibit 24.9 VRMS noise in the action potential band and a total usable bandwidth from 0.2 Hz to 10 kHz.",

    "abstract": "We present three deep learning sequence prediction models for hemolysis, solubility, and resistance to non-specific interactions of peptides that achieve comparable results to the state-of-the-art models. Our sequence-based solubility predictor, MahLooL, outperforms the current state-of-art methods for short peptides. These models are implemented as a static website without the use of a dedicated server or cloud computing. Web-based models like this allow for accessible and effective reproducibility. Most existing approaches rely on third-party servers typically that require upkeep and maintenance. That trend leads to a relatively longer lifetime of web-based models. These predictive models do not require servers, require no installation of dependencies, and work on across a range of devices. The models are bidirectional recurrent neural networks. This serverless prediction model is a demonstration of edge machine learning that removes the dependence on cloud providers.

    "abstract": "Long-range material transport is essential to maintain the physiological functions of multicellular organisms such as animals and plants. By contrast, material transport in bacteria is often short-ranged and limited by diffusion. Here we report a unique form of actively regulated long-range directed material transport in structured bacterial communities. Using Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies as a model system, we discover that a large-scale and temporally evolving open channel system spontaneously develops in the colony via shear-induced banding. Fluid flows in the open channels support high-speed (up to 450 {micro}m/s) transport of cells and outer membrane vesicles over centimeters, and help to eradicate colonies of a competing species Staphylococcus aureus. The open channels are reminiscent of human-made canals for cargo transport, and the channel flows are driven by interfacial tension mediated by cell-secreted biosurfactants. The spatial-temporal dynamics of fluid flows in the open channels are qualitatively described by flow profile measurement and mathematical modeling. Our findings demonstrate that mechanochemical coupling between interfacial force and biosurfactant kinetics can coordinate large-scale material transport in primitive life forms, suggesting a new principle to engineer self-organized microbial communities.",
