    "abstract": "Stable isotope probing (SIP) approaches are a critical tool in microbiome research to determine associations between species and substrates. The application of these approaches ranges from studying microbial communities important for global biogeochemical cycling to host-microbiota interactions in the intestinal tract. Current SIP approaches, such as DNA-SIP or nanoSIMS, are limited in terms of sensitivity, resolution or throughput. Here we present an ultra-sensitive, high-throughput protein-based stable isotope probing approach (Protein-SIP), which cuts cost for labeled substrates by [~]90% as compared to other SIP and Protein-SIP approaches and thus enables isotope labeling experiments on much larger scales and with higher replication. It allows for the determination of isotope incorporation into microbiome members with species level resolution using standard metaproteomics LC-MS/MS measurements. The analysis has been implemented as an open-source application (https://sourceforge.net/projects/calis-p/). We demonstrate sensitivity, precision and accuracy using bacterial cultures and mock communities with different labeling schemes. Furthermore, we benchmark our approach against two existing Protein-SIP approaches and show that in the low labeling range used our approach is the most sensitive and accurate. Finally, we measure translational activity using 18O heavy water labeling in a 63-species community derived from human fecal samples grown on media simulating two different diets. Activity could be quantified on average for 27 species per sample, with 9 species showing significantly higher activity on a high protein diet, as compared to a high fiber diet. Surprisingly, among the species with increased activity on high protein were several Bacteroides species known as fiber consumers. Apparently, protein supply is a critical consideration when assessing growth of intestinal microbes on fiber, including fiber based prebiotics. In summary, we demonstrate that our Protein-SIP approach allows for the ultra-sensitive (0.01% to 10% label) detection of stable isotopes of elements found in proteins, using standard metaproteomics data.",

    "abstract": "Although every life event is unique, there are considerable commonalities across events. However, little is known about whether or how the brain flexibly represents information about different event components at encoding and during remembering. Here, we show that different cortico-hippocampal networks systematically represent specific components of events depicted in videos, both during viewing and during episodic memory retrieval. Regions of an Anterior Temporal Network represented information about people, generalizing across contexts, whereas regions of a Posterior Medial Network represented context information, generalizing across people. Medial prefrontal cortex generalized across videos depicting the same schema, whereas the hippocampus maintained event-specific representations. Similar effects were seen in real-time and recall, suggesting reuse of event components across overlapping episodic memories. These findings reveal a computationally optimal strategy in cortico-hippocampal networks for encoding different high-level event components, supporting efficient reuse for event comprehension, imagination, and recollection.",

    "abstract": "When we remember events, we often do not only recall individual events, but also the connections between them. However, extant research has focused on how humans segment and remember discrete events from continuous input, with far less attention given to how the structure of connections between events impacts memory. Here we conduct a functional magnetic resonance imaging study in which subjects watch and recall a series of realistic audiovisual narratives. By transforming narratives into networks of events, we demonstrate that more central events--those with stronger semantic or causal connections to other events--are better remembered. During encoding, central events evoke larger hippocampal event boundary responses associated with memory formation. During recall, high centrality is associated with stronger activation in cortical areas involved in episodic recollection, and more similar neural representations across individuals. Together, these results suggest that when humans encode and retrieve complex real-world experiences, the reliability and accessibility of memory representations is shaped by their location within a network of events.",

    "abstract": "The advance of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has enabled us easily to generate gene knockout cell lines by introducing insertion/deletion mutations (indels) at the target site via the error-prone non-homologous end joining repair system. Frameshift-promoting indels can disrupt gene functions by generation of a premature stop codon. However, there is growing evidence that targeted genes are not always knocked-out by the indel-based gene disruption. In this study, we established a pipeline of CRISPR-del, which induces a large chromosomal deletion by cutting two different target sites, to perform \"complete\" gene knockout efficiently in non-transformed human diploid RPE1 cells. By optimizing several procedures, the CRISPR-del pipeline allowed us to generate knockout cell lines harboring bi-allelic large chromosomal deletions in a high-throughput manner. Quantitative analyses show that the frequency of gene deletion with this approach is much higher than that of conventional CRISPR-del methods. The lengths of the deleted genomic regions demonstrated in this study are longer than those of 95% of the human protein-coding genes. Furthermore, the pipeline enables the generation of a model cell line having a bi-allelic cancer-associated chromosomal deletion. Overall, these data lead us to propose that the CRISPR-del pipeline is a high-throughput approach for performing \"complete\" gene knockout in RPE1 cells.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel method of bacterial image segmentation using machine learning models trained with Synthetic Micrographs of Bacteria (SyMBac). SyMBac is a tool that allows for rapid, automatic creation of arbitrary amounts of training data, combining detailed models of cell growth, physical interactions, and microscope optics to create synthetic images which closely resemble real micrographs. The major advantages of our approach are: 1) synthetic training data can be generated virtually instantly, and on demand; 2) these synthetic images are accompanied by perfect ground truth positions of cells, meaning no data curation is required; 3) different biological conditions, imaging platforms, and imaging modalities can be rapidly simulated, meaning any change in ones experimental setup no longer requires the laborious process of manually generating new training data for each change. Our benchmarking results demonstrate that models trained on SyMBac data generate more accurate and precise cell masks than those trained on human annotated data, because the model learns the true position of the cell irrespective of imaging artefacts. Machine-learning models trained with SyMBac data are capable of analysing data from various imaging platforms and are robust to drastic changes in cell size and morphology.",

    "abstract": "Plants continuously adjust organ initiation and growth to endogenous and environmental signals. At the heart of this postembryonic mode of development are stem cells, whose activity is influenced by a large diversity of signaling pathways. We have shown previously that the TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase network controls expression of WUSCHEL (WUS), a transcriptional master regulator of stem cells in the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by integrating metabolic- and light signals. While this provided a framework how environmental parameters determine shoot development, the mechanisms linking TOR and WUS activity remained unresolved. Here we show that TOR controls the accumulation of trans-zeatin, the cytokinin species mainly responsible for shoot development, by translational repression of RNAs encoding cytokinin degrading CYTOKININ OXIDASES/DEHYDROGENASE (CKX) enzymes. Thus, our work not only sheds light on how plants are able to quickly adjust stem cell activity in response to their environment, but also opens new avenues for studying the mechanisms translating TOR kinase activity into relevant biological output.",

    "abstract": "Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are agents of horizontal gene transfer in bacteria, but can also be vertically inherited by daughter cells. Establishing the dynamics that led to contemporary patterns of MGEs in bacterial genomes is central to predicting the emergence and evolution of novel and resistant pathogens. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clonal-complex (CC) 398 is the dominant MRSA in European livestock and a growing cause of human infections. Previous studies have identified three categories of MGEs whose presence or absence distinguishes livestock-associated CC398 from a closely related and less antibiotic-resistant human-associated population. Here we fully characterise the evolutionary dynamics of these MGEs using a collection of 1,180 CC398 genomes, sampled from livestock and humans, over 27 years. We find that the emergence of livestock-associated CC398 coincided with the acquisition of a Tn916 transposon carrying a tetracycline resistance gene, which has been stably inherited for 57 years. This was followed by the acquisition of a type V SCCmec that carries methicillin, tetracycline and heavy metal resistance genes, which has been maintained for 35 years, with occasional truncations and replacements with type IV SCCmec. In contrast, a class of prophages that carry a human immune evasion gene cluster and that are largely absent from livestock-associated CC398, have been repeatedly gained and lost in both human- and livestock-associated CC398. These contrasting dynamics mean that when livestock-associated MRSA is transmitted to humans, adaptation to the human host outpaces loss of antibiotic resistance. In addition, the stable inheritance of resistance-associated MGEs suggests that the impact of ongoing reductions in antibiotic and zinc oxide use in European farms on livestock-associated MRSA will be slow to be realised.",

    "abstract": "Targeted protein degradation (TPD) has emerged as a powerful approach in drug discovery for removing (rather than inhibiting) proteins implicated in diseases. A key step in this approach is the formation of an induced proximity complex, where a degrader molecule recruits an E3 ligase to the protein of interest (POI), facilitating the transfer of ubiquitin to the POI and initiating the proteasomal degradation process. Here, we address three critical aspects of the TPD process: 1) formation of the ternary complex induced by a degrader molecule, 2) conformational heterogeneity of the ternary complex, and 3) assessment of ubiquitination propensity via the full Cullin Ring Ligase (CRL) macromolecular assembly. The novel approach presented here combines experimental biophysical data--in this case hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS, which measures the solvent exposure of protein residues)--with all-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations aided by enhanced sampling techniques to predict structural ensembles of ternary complexes at atomic resolution. We present results demonstrating the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of our approach to predict ternary structure ensembles using the bromodomain of SMARCA2 (SMARCA2BD) with the E3 ligase VHL as the system of interest. The simulations reproduce X-ray crystal structures - including prospective simulations validated on a new structure that we determined in this work (PDB ID: 7S4E) - with root mean square deviations (RMSD) of 1.1 to 1.6 [A]. The simulations also reveal a structural ensemble of low-energy conformations of the ternary complex within a broad energy basin. To further characterize the structural ensemble, we used snapshots from the aforementioned simulations as seeds for Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (HREMD) simulations, and then perform 7.1 milliseconds of aggregate simulation time using Folding@home. The resulting free energy surface identifies the crystal structure conformation within a broad low-energy basin and the dynamic ensemble is consistent with solution-phase biophysical experimental data (HDX-MS and small-angle x-ray scattering, SAXS). Finally, we graft structures from the ternary complexes onto the full CRL and perform enhanced sampling simulations, where we find that differences in degradation efficiency can be explained by the proximity distribution of lysine residues on the POI relative to the E2-loaded ubiquitin. Several of the top predicted ubiquitinated lysine residues are validated prospectively through a ubiquitin mapping proteomics experiment.",

    "abstract": "Many organisms are known to regulate seasonal behaviors and physiological processes in response to day length changes through photoperiodism. Extreme changes in photoperiods have detrimental effects on human health, which can impair development and serve as the origin of adult diseases. Since the seminal work by Bunning in 1936, there are studies supporting the view that organisms can measure the day length through an endogenous 24-hour cellular circadian clock. However, the mechanisms involved in measuring seasonal or day-length changes are not understood. In the current study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on photoperiodism using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel. The GWAS identified 4 top candidate genes responsible for photoperiodic regulations. The knockout mutants of the four candidate genes (Protein Kinase C delta (Pkcdelta), Glucuronyltransferase-P (GlcAT-P), Brain-specific homeobox (Bsh), and Diuretic hormone 31 Receptor (Dh31-R1)) were analyzed for their photoperiod and circadian period phenotypes. PKCdelta and GlcAT-P mutants show a significantly different photoperiod response compared to that of the wild type strain, and also had an altered circadian period phenotype. Further molecular characterization revealed two independent mutant alleles of PKCdelta with a defective catalytic domain had distinct photoperiod responses. Taken these data together, we concluded that there is overlap between the circadian clock and photoperiodic regulations in Drosophila, and PKCdelta is a component that is involved in both circadian and photoperiodic regulations. By identifying novel molecular components of photoperiod, the current study provides new insights into the genetic mechanisms of determining the seasonal changes.\n\nAuthor SummaryExtreme changes in photoperiods have detrimental effects on human health, which can impair development and serve as the origin of adult diseases. The molecular and genetic mechanisms of how an organism interprets and adapts to seasonal environmental changes are not well understood. Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) is a community resource of 205 inbred lines created for studying population genomics and quantitative traits. Using DGRP we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to find potential photoperiod candidate genes. PKCdelta, a candidate gene from the GWAS study was identified to have both photoperiod and circadian effects. This data supports the view that circadian clock and photoperiodism have a shared regulatory circuit. Our study sheds light onto potential genes that could be further studied to characterize the mechanisms of photoperiodism, and its relationship to the circadian clock.",

The severity of AN combined with the absence of localized brain abnormalities suggests distributed, systemic underpinnings that may be identified using diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) and tractography to reconstruct white matter pathways.\n\nMethodsdMRI data acquired from female patients with AN (n = 147) and female healthy controls (HC; n = 119), aged 12-40 years, were combined across five studies. Probabilistic tractography was completed, and full cortex connectomes describing streamline counts between 84 brain regions generated and harmonized. Graph theory methods were used to describe alterations in network organization in AN. The network-based statistic tested between-group differences in brain subnetwork connectivity. The metrics strength and efficiency indexed the connectivity of brain regions (network nodes), and were compared between groups using multiple linear regression.\n\nResultsIndividuals with AN, relative to HC, had reduced connectivity in a network comprising subcortical regions and greater connectivity between frontal cortical regions (p < 0.05, FWE corrected). Node-based analyses indicated reduced connectivity of the left hippocampus in patients relative to HC (p < 0.05, permutation corrected). Severity of illness, assessed by BMI, was associated with subcortical connectivity (p < 0.05, uncorrected).\n\nConclusionsAnalyses identified reduced structural connectivity of subcortical networks and regions, and stronger cortical network connectivity, amongst individuals with AN relative to HC. These findings are consistent with alterations in feeding, emotion and executive control circuits in AN, and may direct hypothesis-driven research into mechanisms of persistent restrictive eating behavior.",

Such PT-enhanced organoids possess improved albumin and organic cation uptake, appropriate KIM-1 upregulation in response to cisplatin, and improved expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors resulting in increased viral replication. The striking proximo-distal orientation of nephrons resulted from localized WNT antagonism originating from the organoid stromal core.

    "abstract": "Plants are able to sense changes in their light environments, such as the onset of day and night, as well as anticipate these changes in order to adapt and survive. Central to this ability is the plant circadian clock, a molecular circuit that precisely orchestrates plant cell processes over the course of a day. REVEILLE proteins (RVEs) are recently discovered members of the plant circadian circuitry that activate the evening complex and PRR genes to maintain regular circadian oscillation. The RVE 8 protein and its two homologs, RVE 4 and 6, have been shown to limit the length of the circadian period, with rve 4 6 8 triple-knockout plants possessing an elongated period along with increased leaf surface area, biomass, cell size and delayed flowering relative to wild-type Col-0 plants. Here, using a multi-omics approach consisting of phenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics we draw novel connections between RVE8-like proteins and a number of core plant cell processes. In particular, we reveal that loss of RVE8-like proteins results in altered carbohydrate, organic acid and lipid metabolism, including a starch excess phenotype at dawn. We further demonstrate that rve 4 6 8 plants have lower levels of 20S proteasome subunits and possess significantly reduced proteasome activity, potentially explaining the increase in cell-size observed in RVE8-like mutants. Overall, this robust, multi-omic dataset, provides substantial new insights into the far reaching impact RVE8-like proteins have on the diel plant cell environment.",

    "abstract": "Increased fragmentation caused by habitat loss represents a major threat to the persistence of animal populations. How fragmentation affects populations depends on the rate at which individuals move between spatially separated patches. Whereas negative effects of habitat loss on biodiversity are well-known, effects of fragmentation per se on population dynamics and ecosystem stability remain less understood. Here, we use a spatially explicit predator-prey model to investigate how the interplay between fragmentation and optimal foraging behavior affects predator-prey interactions and, subsequently, ecosystem stability. We study systems wherein prey occupies isolated patches and are consumed by predators that disperse following Levy random walks. Our results show that the Levy exponent and the degree of fragmentation jointly determine coexistence probabilities. In highly fragmented landscapes, Brownian and ballistic predators go extinct and only scale-free predators can coexist with prey. Furthermore, our results confirm that predation causes irreversible habitat loss in fragmented landscapes due to overexploitation of smaller patches of prey. Moreover, we show that predator dispersal can reduce, but not prevent nor minimize, the amount of lost habitat. Our results suggest that integrating optimal foraging theory into population- and landscape ecology is crucial to assessing the impact of fragmentation on biodiversity and ecosystem stability.",

Here we use metagenomics information as an external quantitative phenotype to map the host genetic determinants of the rhizosphere microbiota in wild and domesticated genotypes of barley, the fourth most cultivated cereal globally. We identify a small number of loci with a major effect on the composition of rhizosphere communities. One of those, designated the QRMC-3HS, emerges as a major determinant of microbiota composition. We subject soil-grown sibling lines harbouring contrasting alleles at QRMC-3HS and hosting contrasting microbiotas to comparative root RNA-seq profiling. This allows us to identify three primary candidate genes, including a Nucleotide-Binding-Leucine-Rich-Repeat (NLR) gene in a region of structural variation of the barley genome. Our results provide insights into the footprint of crop improvement on the plants capacity of shaping rhizosphere microbes.",

    "abstract": "Limb regeneration in Ambystoma mexicanum occurs in various size fields and can recreate consistent limb morphology. The mechanism that supports such stable limb morphogenesis regardless of size is unknown. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) and fibroblasts growth factor 8 (FGF8) play important roles in anteroposterior limb patterning, similar to other tetrapods. Focusing on these two factors, we investigated the detailed expression pattern and function of Shh and Fgf8 in various blastema sizes in axolotl limb regeneration. We measured and functionally analyzed the expression domains of Shh and Fgf8 in regenerating limb blastema of various sizes, and found that, although the position and size of the Shh+ and Fgf8+ domains varied depending on the size of the blastema, the secretion of SHH was maintained at a relatively fixed working distance, regardless of blastema size. This stable secretory distance of SHH resulted in the formation of an active proliferative zone (aPZ) in the vicinity of SHH, regardless of blastema size. The aPZ was under the mitogenic influence of SHH and FGF8, resulting in high cell density in the aPZ. We also examined the impact of the aPZ on digit formation. We found that the first digit formation occurs in the aPZ. Next, the aPZ gradually shifts posteriorly as digits develop, which contributes to new digit formation at the site of the shifted aPZ. We also found that the exogenously formed aPZ caused extra digit formation even after the completion of autopod morphogenesis. Our findings suggest that the variable Shh-Fgf8 positioning in various blastema sizes causes various positioning of the aPZ, and that the aPZ leads to digit formation. The mechanism we propose here accounts for stable digit morphogenesis regardless of blastema sizes and urodele-specific digit formation.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA unique SHH-FGF8 spatial interaction compensates for robust limb morphogenesis in various limb sizes.",

    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is heavily involved in cognitive and emotional processes, including working memory, cognition, stress responses, and fear associated behaviors. Many PFC-associated behaviors are time-of-day dependent, and disruption of daily rhythms negatively impacts these behavioral outputs, yet how the disruption of daily rhythms impacts the fundamental function of PFC neurons, and the mechanism(s) by which this occurs, remains unknown. Using a mouse model, we demonstrate that the activity and action potential dynamics of prelimbic PFC neurons are regulated by time-of-day in a sex specific manner. Further, we show that postsynaptic K+ channels play a central role in mediating these rhythms, suggesting an intrinsic gating mechanism mediating information throughput. Finally, we demonstrate that environmental circadian desynchronization alters the intrinsic functioning of these neurons in part by increasing sensitivity GIRK channel activation. These key discoveries demonstrate daily rhythms contribute to the mechanisms underlying the essential physiology of PFC circuits, and provide potential mechanisms by which circadian disruption may impact the fundamental properties of neurons.\n\nSignificance StatementDisruption of circadian rhythms, such as shift work and jet lag, are associated with negative physiological and behavioral outcomes, including changes in affective state, cognitive function, learning and memory. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a critical role in these functions, yet how daily rhythms and desynchronization of these rhythms impact the physiology of neurons in the PFC is unknown. Here we demonstrate that daily rhythms impact the physiological function of PFC neurons in a sex-dependent manner, and that environmental circadian desynchronization alters PFC function irrespective of time-of-day. These findings provide not only a physiological context to the neural and behavioral changes associated with circadian desynchronization, but also highlight the importance of considering the temporal dimension in studies of neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Chemical modifications of DNA and histone proteins impact the organization of chromatin within the nucleus. Changes in these modifications, catalyzed by different chromatin-modifying enzymes, influence chromatin organization, which in turn is thought to impact the spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression. While combinations of different histone modifications, the histone code, have been studied in several model species, we know very little about histone modifications in the fungal genus Aspergillus, whose members are generally well-studied due to their importance as models in cell and molecular biology as well as their medical and biotechnological relevance. Here, we used phylogenetic analyses in 94 Aspergilli as well as other fungi to uncover the occurrence and evolutionary trajectories of enzymes and protein complexes with roles in chromatin modifications or regulation. We found that these enzymes and complexes are highly conserved in Aspergilli, pointing towards a complex repertoire of chromatin modifications. Nevertheless, we also observed few recent gene duplications or losses, highlighting Aspergillus species to further study the roles of specific chromatin modifications. SET7 (KMT6) and other components of PRC2 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 2), which is responsible for methylation on histone H3 at lysine 27 in many eukaryotes including fungi, are absent in Aspergilli as well as in closely related Penicillium species, suggesting that these lost the capacity for this histone modification. We corroborated our computational predictions by performing untargeted mass spectrometry analysis of histone post-translational modifications in Aspergillus nidulans. This systematic analysis will pave the way for future research into the complexity of the histone code and its functional implications on genome architecture and gene regulation in fungi.\n\nData SummaryThe predicted proteomes used in this study are publicly available at the JGI (Joint Genome Institute) MycoCosm repository (1); the species names and abbreviations are listed in Supplementary Table 1. To evaluate the completeness of the predicted proteomes and to obtain a species phylogeny, 758 fungal BUSCO (Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Ortholog) genes were used, and their names are listed in Supplementary Table 2. The fasta, trimmed alignment, and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree files can be found in Supplementary Data 1 and 2 deposited at Zenodo (10.5281/zenodo.6586562). The mass spectrometry results mentioned in Supplementary Table 6 are deposited in the PRIDE database with the dataset identifier PXD033478.\n\nImpact StatementUncovering how fungi regulate gene expression and genome organization is an important step to understand how they control biological processes such as growth or biosynthesis of bioactive molecules. Despite the known importance of chromatin modifications in controlling a plethora of biological processes across eukaryotes, they remain particularly poorly understood in filamentous fungi, even in model organisms like Aspergilli. Our systematic evolutionary analysis provides a robust framework for the functional analysis of chromatin modifications in Aspergillus species and other fungi. Our results do not only implicate candidate enzymes to play a role in new chromatin modifications, but they also point at species that have experienced duplications or losses of genes encoding enzymes for specific chromatin modifications. We therefore expect that this work will set the stage for future research into the complexity of the histone code and its functional implications on gene regulation and genome organization in fungi.",

In humans, Spns2 functions as the main S1P transporter in endothelial cells, making it a potential drug target for modulating S1P signaling. Here, we employed an integrated approach in lipid membranes to identify unknown conformational states of a bacterial Spns from Hyphomonas neptunium (HnSpns) and to define its proton- and substrate-coupled conformational dynamics. Our systematic study reveals conserved residues critical for protonation steps and their regulation, and how sequential protonation of these proton switches coordinates the conformational transitions in the context of a noncanonical ligand-dependent alternating access. A conserved periplasmic salt bridge (Asp60TM2:Arg289TM7) keeps the transporter in a closed conformation, while proton-dependent conformational dynamics are significantly enhanced on the periplasmic side, providing a pathway for ligand exchange. Furthermore, our resistance assays reveal substrate polyspecificity and HnSpns multidrug resistance (MDR) activity that underscore the previously unknown role of Spns proteins in MDR, beyond their activity in sphingolipid transport and signaling.",

Developing and maintaining NEURON over several decades has required attention to the competing needs of backwards compatibility, evolving computer architectures, the addition of new scales and physical processes, accessibility to new users, and efficiency and flexibility for specialists. In order to meet these challenges, we have now substantially modernized NEURON, providing continuous integration, an improved build system and release workflow, and better documentation. With the help of a new source-to-source compiler of the NMODL domain-specific language we have enhanced NEURONs ability to run efficiently, via the CoreNEURON simulation engine, on a variety of hardware platforms, including GPUs. Through the implementation of an optimized in-memory transfer mechanism this performance optimized backend is made easily accessible to users, providing training and model-development paths from laptop to workstation to supercomputer and cloud platform. Similarly, we have been able to accelerate NEURONs reaction-diffusion simulation performance through the use of just-in-time compilation. We show that these efforts have led to a growing developer base, a simpler and more robust software distribution, a wider range of supported computer architectures, a better integration of NEURON with other scientific workflows, and substantially improved performance for the simulation of biophysical and biochemical models.",

    "abstract": "The adaptive potential of plant fungal pathogens is largely governed by the gene content of a species, comprised of core and ancillary genes across the pathogen isolate repertoire. To approximate the complete gene repertoire of a globally significant crop fungal pathogen, a pan genomic analysis was undertaken for Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), the causal agent of tan (or yellow) spot disease in wheat.\n\nIn this study, fifteen new Ptr genomes were sequenced, assembled and annotated, including isolates from three races not previously sequenced. Together with eleven previously published Ptr genomes, a pangenome for twenty-six Ptr isolates from Australia, Europe, North Africa and America, representing nearly all known races, revealed a conserved core-gene content of 57% and presents a new Ptr resource for searching natural homologues using remote protein structural homology. Here, we identify for the first time a nonsynonymous mutation in the Ptr effector gene ToxB, multiple copies of toxb, a distant natural Pyrenophora homologue of a known Parastagonopora nodorum effector, and clear genomic break points for the ToxA effector horizontal transfer region.\n\nThis comprehensive genomic analysis of Ptr races includes nine isolates sequenced via long read technologies. Accordingly, these resources provide a more complete representation of the species, and serve as a resource to monitor variations potentially involved in pathogenicity.\n\nAuthor NotesAll supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files. Five supplementary data files and fifteen supplementary figures are available with the online version of this article.\n\nImpact StatementOur Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr) pangenome study provides resources and analyses for the identification of pathogen virulence factors, of high importance to microbial research. Key findings include: 1) Analysis of eleven new sequenced (with three new races not previously available) and previously published isolates, 26 genomes in total, representing the near complete Ptr race set for known effector production collected from Australia, Europe, North Africa and the Americas. 2) We show that although Ptr has low core gene conservation, the whole genome divergence of other wheat pathogens was greater. 3) The new PacBio sequenced genomes provide unambiguous genomic break points for the large ToxA effector horizontal transfer region, which is only present in ToxA producing races. 4) A new web-based Ptr resource for searching in silico remote protein structural homology is presented, and a distant natural Pyrenophora protein homologue of a known effector from another wheat pathogen is identified for the first time.\n\nData SummaryThe sources and genomic sequences used throughout this study have been deposited in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), under the assembly accession numbers provided in Tables 1 and 2 (available in the online version of this article).

The on-going reduction in ecosystem functionality is driven by global and local threats. The orders Testudines (turtles and tortoises) and Crocodilia (crocodiles, alligators, and gharials) contain numerous threatened, long-lived species for which their functional diversity and potential erosion by anthropogenic impacts remains unknown. Here, we examine 259 (69%) of the existing 375 species of Testudines and Crocodilia, quantifying their life history strategies (i.e., schedules of survival, development, and reproduction) from open-access data on their demography, ancestry, and threats. We find that the loss of functional diversity in simulated extinction scenarios of threatened species is greater than expected by chance. Moreover, the effects of unsustainable local consumption, diseases, and pollution are associated with specific functional strategies. In contrast, climate change, habitat disturbance, and global trade affect all species independent of their life history strategy. Importantly, the loss of functional diversity for threatened species by habitat disturbance is twice that for all other threats. Our findings highlight the importance of conservation programmes focused on preserving the functional diversity of life history strategies jointly with the phylogenetic representativity of these highly threatened groups.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic cost minimization is thought to underscore the neural control of locomotion. Yet, avoiding high muscle activation, a cause of fatigue, often outperforms energy minimization in computational predictions of human gait. Discerning the relative importance of these criteria in human walking has proved elusive, in part, because they have not been empirically decoupled. Here we explicitly decouple whole-body metabolic cost and  fatigue-like muscle activation costs (estimated from electromyography) by pitting them against one another using two distinct gait tasks. When experiencing these competing costs, participants (N=10) chose the task that avoided overburdening muscles (fatigue avoidance) at the expense of higher metabolic power (p<0.05). Muscle volume-normalized activation more closely models energy use and was also minimized by the participants decision (p<0.05), demonstrating that muscle activation was, at best, an inaccurate signal for metabolic energy. Energy minimization was only observed when there was no adverse effect on muscle activation costs. By decoupling whole-body metabolic and muscle activation costs, we provide among the first empirical evidence of humans embracing non-energetic optimality in favor of a clearly defined neuromuscular objective. This finding indicates that local muscle fatigue and effort may well be key factors dictating human walking behavior and its evolution.",

    "abstract": "Inevitable skin scarring devoid of dermal appendages bring about unfavorable effects on both aesthetic and physiological functions. Here we offered an available method for large-area wound regeneration using biodegradable Aligned extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold. Accelerating wound coverage and enhanced hair follicle (HF) neogenesis were observed with the implantation of biomaterials. Multimodal analysis during wound regeneration provides a unique lens through which we can explore the foreign body responses (FBR) around biomaterials. First, we identified cell heterogeneity in responses to ECM scaffolds using single-cell RNA sequencing. Next the spatial anchor highlighted preferential recruitment of T cells around biomaterials colocalized with hair follicle precursor cells. Reconstruction of signaling pathways suggested the pro-regenerative effect of the adaptive immune systems on HF neogenesis. Immunodeficient mice lacking mature T lymphocytes lost the ability to activate papillary fibroblast as well as stimulate HF regeneration, validating the potential therapeutic effect of the adaptive immune system activated by biomaterials. In conclusion, this study provided the further understanding of the FBR and facilitate the design of immunoregulatory biomaterials for biomedical application in the future.",

This study develops an unsupervised dimensionality reduction method called UnTANGLeD (Unsupervised Trait Analysis of Networks from Gene Level Data) which organises 16,849 genes into discrete gene programs by measuring the statistical association between genetic variants and 1,393 diverse complex traits. UnTANGLeD reveals 173 gene clusters enriched for protein-protein interactions and highly distinct biological processes governing development, signalling, disease, and homeostasis. We identify diverse gene networks with robust interactions but not associated with known biological processes. Analysis of independent disease traits shows that UnTANGLeD gene clusters are conserved across all complex traits, providing a simple and powerful framework to predict novel gene candidates and programs influencing orthogonal disease phenotypes. Collectively, this study demonstrates that gene programs co-ordinately orchestrating cell functions can be identified without reliance on prior knowledge, providing a method for use in functional annotation, hypothesis generation, machine learning and prediction algorithms, and the interpretation of diverse genomic data.",

The functional core of PRC2 is highly conserved in animals and consists of four subunits. One of these, SUZ12, has not been identified in the genetic model Caenorhabditis elegans, whereas C. elegans PRC2 contains the clade-specific MES-3 protein. Through unbiased sensitive sequence similarity searches complemented by high-quality structure predictions of monomers and multimers, we here demonstrate that MES-3 is a highly divergent ortholog of SUZ12. MES-3 shares protein folds and conserved residues of key domains with SUZ12 and is predicted to interact with core PRC2 members similar to SUZ12 in human PRC2. Thus, in agreement with previous genetic and biochemical studies, we provide evidence that C. elegans contains a diverged yet evolutionary conserved core PRC2, like other animals.",

    "abstract": "Molluscs constitute the second largest phylum of animals in the world, and shell colour and stripes are one of their most important phenotypic characteristics. Studies on the mechanism of shell pigmentation help understand the evolutionary and ecological significance of shell colour and serve as the basis for shell colour breeding. In this study, a matched-pair design was used in comparing the black- and white-striped mantles of the same oyster. The result showed that the stripes of shell surface are corresponding to the stripes of the mantle edge. Transcriptomic analysis identified an uncharacterized protein gene (we named it as Crassostrea gigas chitin-binding protein, CgCBP) highly expressed in the black mantles. Three folds (inner fold, middle fold and outer fold) were found on the mantle edge of oyster, but only the outer fold has the same colour as the shell. Transcriptomic comparison indicated that the three folds of the mantle edge are functionally differentiated, and the CgCBP gene is ultra-highly expressed only in the outer fold. We obtained new black and white shell periostraca from the shell notching experiment and found their structural differences by scanning electron microscope. Chitin was successfully extracted and identified from the shell periostraca. Proteomic analysis revealed differences in protein composition between the two shell periostraca. Particularly, the black shell periostraca have more proteins related to melanin biosynthesis and chitin binding compared with the white ones, and melanin particles were observed in the black mantle edge using transmission electron microscope. Magnetic bead binding and Western blot experiments showed that the CgCBP protein can specifically bind to chitin and in vivo RNAi screening indicated that CgCBP knockdown can change the structure of the shell periostracum and reduce its pigmentation. All these results suggest that the outer fold of mantle may have more important roles in shell pigmentation, shell periostracum structure is functionally correlated with shell pigmentation, and the CgCBP gene ultra-highly expressed in the outer fold may influence shell pigmentation by affecting its periostracum structure.",

    "abstract": "The protective role of Natural Killer (NK) cell tumour immunosurveillance has long been recognised in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, as most patients show limited intra-tumoral NK cell infiltration, improving our ability to identify those with high NK cell activity might aid in dissecting the molecular features which could trigger strong response to NK cell-mediated immune killing. Here, a novel CRC-specific NK cell gene signature capable of inferring NK cell load in primary tissue samples was derived and validated in multiple patient CRC cohorts. The specificity of the signature is substantiated in tumour-infiltrating NK cells from primary CRC tumours at the single cell level, and the expression profile of each constituent gene is explored in NK cells of different maturation states, activation status and anatomical origin. Thus, in contrast with other NK cell gene signatures that have several overlapping genes across different immune cell types, our NK cell signature has been extensively refined to be specific for CRC-infiltrating NK cells and includes genes which identify a broad spectrum of NK cell subtypes. Moreover, it was shown that this novel NK cell signature accurately discriminates murine NK cells, demonstrating the potential applicability of this signature when mining datasets generated from both clinical and animal studies. Differential gene expression analysis revealed tumour-intrinsic features associated with NK cell inclusion versus exclusion in CRC patients, with those tumours with predicted high NK activity showing strong evidence of enhanced chemotactic and cytotoxic transcriptional programs. Furthermore, survival modelling indicated that NK signature expression is associated with improved survival outcomes in two large cohorts of primary CRC patients. Thus, scoring CRC samples with this refined NK cell signature might aid in identifying patients with high NK cell activity who could be prime candidates for NK cell directed immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Memory consolidation processes have traditionally been investigated from the perspective of hours or days. However, the latest developments in memory research showed that memory consolidation processes could occur even within seconds, possibly due to the neural replay of just-practiced memory traces during short breaks. Here, we investigate this rapid form of consolidation during statistical learning. We aim to answer (a) whether this rapid consolidation occurs in implicit statistical learning and general skill learning and (b) whether the duration of rest periods affects these two learning types differently. Participants performed a widely used statistical learning task - the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task - that enables us to measure implicit statistical and general skill learning separately. The ASRT task consisted of 25 learning blocks with a rest period between the blocks. In a between-subjects design, the length of the rest periods was fixed at 15 or 30 seconds, or the participants could control the length themselves. We found that the duration of rest periods does not affect the amount of statistical knowledge acquired but does change the dynamics of learning. Shorter rest periods led to better learning during the learning blocks, whereas longer rest periods promoted learning also in the between block rest periods, possibly due to the higher amount of replay. Moreover, we found weaker general skill learning in the self-paced group than in the fixed rest period groups. These results suggest that distinct learning processes are differently affected by the duration of short rest periods.",

    "abstract": "The Tropical Andes Biodiversity Hotspot holds a remarkable number of species at risk of extinction due to anthropogenic habitat loss, hunting and climate change. One of these species, the Critically Endangered yellow-tailed woolly monkey (Lagothrix flavicauda), was recently sighted in Junin region, 206 kilometres south of its previously known distribution. The range extension, combined with continued habitat loss, calls for a re-evaluation of the species distribution and available suitable habitat. Here, we present novel data from surveys at 53 sites in the regions of Junin, Cerro de Pasco, Ayacucho and Cusco. We encountered L. flavicauda at 9 sites, all in Junin, and the congeneric L. l. tschudii at 20 sites, but never in sympatry. Using these new localities along with all previous geographic localities for the species, we made predictive Species Distribution Models based on Ecological Niche Modelling using a generalized linear model and maximum entropy. Each model incorporated bioclimatic variables, forest cover, vegetation measurements, and elevation as predictor variables. Model evaluation showed >80% accuracy for all measures. Precipitation was the strongest predictor of species presence. Habitat suitability maps illustrate potential corridors for gene flow between the southern and northern populations, although much of this area is inhabited by L. l. tschudii. An analysis of the current protected area (PA) network showed [~]47% of remaining suitable habitat is unprotected. With this, we suggest priority areas for new protected areas or expansions to existing reserves that would conserve potential corridors between L. flavicauda populations. Further surveys and characterization of the distribution in intermediate areas, combined with studies on genetic flow, are still needed to protect this species.",

    "abstract": "Patients suffering from debilitating neurodegenerative diseases often lose the ability to communicate, detrimentally affecting their quality of life. One promising solution to restore communication is to decode signals directly from the brain to enable neural speech prostheses. However, decoding has been limited by coarse neural recordings which inadequately capture the rich spatio-temporal structure of human brain signals. To resolve this limitation, we performed novel, high-resolution, micro-electrocorticographic (ECoG) neural recordings during intra-operative speech production. We obtained neural signals with 57x higher spatial resolution and 48% higher signal-to-noise ratio compared to standard invasive recordings. This increased signal quality improved phoneme decoding by 35% compared to standard intracranial signals. Accurate decoding was dependent on the high-spatial resolution of the neural interface. Non-linear decoding models designed to utilize enhanced spatio-temporal neural information produced better results than linear techniques. We show for the first time that ECoG can enable high-quality speech decoding, demonstrating its ability to improve neural interfaces for neural speech prostheses.",

    "abstract": "The protein STING (stimulator of interferon genes) is a central regulator of the innate immune system and plays an important role in antitumor immunity by inducing the production of cytokines such as type I interferon (IFN). Activation of STING stems from the selective recognition of endogenous cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) by the large, polar, and flexible binding site, thus posing challenges to the design of small molecule agonists with drug-like physicochemical properties. In this work we present the design of SNX281, a small molecule STING agonist that functions through a unique self-dimerizing mechanism in the STING binding site, where the ligand dimer approximates the size and shape of a cyclic dinucleotide while maintaining drug-like small molecule properties. SNX281 exhibits systemic exposure, STING-mediated cytokine release, strong induction of type I IFN, potent in vivo antitumor activity, durable immune memory, and single-dose tumor elimination in mouse models via a Cmax-driven pharmacologic response. Bespoke computational methods - a combination of quantum mechanics, molecular dynamics, binding free energy simulations, and artificial intelligence - were developed during the course of the project to design SNX281 by explicitly accounting for the unique self-dimerization mechanism and the large-scale conformational change of the STING protein upon activation. Over the course of the project, we explored millions of virtual molecules while synthesizing and testing only 208 molecules in the lab. This work highlights the value of a multifaceted computationally-driven approach anchored by methods tailored to address target-specific problems encountered along the project progression from initial hit to the clinic.",

    "abstract": "To control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, there is a need to develop vaccines to prevent infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants. One candidate is a nasal vaccine capable of inducing secretory IgA antibodies in the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, the initial site of infection. However, regarding the development of COVID-19 vaccines, there is concern about the potential risk of inducing lung eosinophilic immunopathology as a vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease as a result of the T helper 2 (Th2)-dominant adaptive immune response. In this study, we investigated the protective effect against virus infection induced by intranasal vaccination of recombinant trimeric spike protein derived from SARS-CoV-2 adjuvanted with CpG oligonucleotides, ODN2006, in mouse model. The intranasal vaccine combined with ODN2006 successfully induced not only systemic spike-specific IgG antibodies, but also secretory IgA antibodies in the nasal mucosa. Secretory IgA antibodies showed high protective ability against SARS-CoV-2 variants (Alpha, Beta and Gamma variants) compared to IgG antibodies in the serum. The nasal vaccine of this formulation induced a high number of IFN-{gamma}-secreting cells in the draining cervical lymph nodes and a lower spike-specific IgG1/IgG2a ratio compared to that of subcutaneous vaccination with alum as a typical Th2 adjuvant. These features are consistent with the induction of the Th1 adaptive immune response. In addition, mice intranasally vaccinated with ODN2006 showed less lung eosinophilic immunopathology after viral challenge than mice subcutaneously vaccinated with alum adjuvant. Our findings indicate that intranasal vaccine adjuvanted with ODN2006 could be a candidate that can prevent the infection of antigenically different variant viruses, reducing the risk of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease.",

    "abstract": "Many animals downregulate body temperature to save energy when resting (rest-phase hypothermia). Small birds that winter at high latitude have comparatively limited capacity for hypothermia and so pay large energy costs for thermoregulation during cold nights. Available evidence suggests this process is fuelled by adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent mechanisms. Most ATP is produced by oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, but mitochondrial respiration can be lower during hypothermia because of the temperature-dependence of biological processes. This can create conflict between increased organismal ATP demand and a lower mitochondrial capacity to provide it. We studied this in blood cell mitochondria of wild great tits (Parus major) by simulating rest-phase hypothermia via a 6{degrees}C reduction in assay temperature in vitro. The birds had spent the night preceding the experiment in thermoneutrality or in temperatures representing mild or very cold winter nights. Night temperature did not affect mitochondrial respiration. Across treatments, endogenous respiration was 14% lower in hypothermia. This did not reflect general thermal suppression because phosphorylating respiration was unaffected by thermal state. Instead, hypothermia was associated with a threefold reduction of leak respiration, from 17% in normothermia to 4% in hypothermia. Thus, coupling of total respiration to ATP production was 96% in hypothermia, compared to 83% in normothermia. Our study shows that thermal insensitivity of phosphorylation combined with short-term plasticity of leak respiration may safeguard ATP production when endogenous respiration is suppressed. This casts new light on the process by which small birds endure harsh winter cold and warrants future tests across tissues in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Understanding mitochondrial biology and pathology is key to understanding the evolution of animal form and function. However, mitochondrial measurement often involves invasive, or even terminal, sampling, which can be difficult to reconcile in wild models or in longitudinal studies. Non-mammal vertebrates contain mitochondria in their red blood cells, which can be exploited for minimally invasive mitochondrial measurement. Several recent bird studies have measured mitochondrial function using isolated blood cells. Isolation adds time in the laboratory and might be associated with physiological complications. Inference may also be constrained on biological grounds by lack of tissue context. We developed and validated a protocol to measure mitochondrial respiration in bird whole blood. Endogenous respiration was comparable between isolated blood cells and whole blood. However, oxidative respiration was higher in whole blood, and whole blood mitochondria were better coupled and had higher maximum working capacity. Whole blood measurement was also more reproducible than measurement on isolated cells for all traits considered. Measurements were feasible over a 10-fold range of sample volumes, though both small and large volumes were associated with changes to respiratory traits. The protocol was compatible with long-term storage: after 24 h at 5 {degrees}C without agitation all respiration traits but maximum working capacity remained unchanged, the latter decreasing by 14%. Our study suggests that whole blood measurement provides faster, more reproducible, and more biologically (tissue context) and physiologically (mitochondrial integrity) relevant assessment of mitochondrial respiration. We recommend future studies to take a whole blood approach unless specific circumstances require the use of isolated blood cells.",

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectivesTime orientation is a fundamental cognitive process in which ones personal sense of time is matched with a universal reference. Assessment of time orientation is a ubiquitous component of neurological mental status examinations and neuropsychological assessments, yet its neural correlates remain unclear. Large bilateral lesions have been associated with deficits in time orientation, but more specific regions of the brain implicated in time disorientation following focal unilateral damage are relatively unknown. The current study investigates the anatomy of time disorientation and its network correlates in patients with focal brain lesions.\n\nMethods550 patients with acquired, focal brain lesions participated in this study, identified retrospectively from the Iowa Neurological Patient Registry. Time orientation was assessed 3 months or more after lesion onset using the Benton Temporal Orientation Test (BTOT), and 39 patients were identified as having chronic impairment in time orientation defined as a score of 3 or worse on the BTOT. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping and lesion network mapping were used to evaluate the anatomy and networks associated with time disorientation. Performance on a variety of neuropsychological tests was compared between the time oriented and time disoriented group.\n\nResults39 patients were identified as having chronic impairment in time orientation. Multivariate lesion-symptom mapping showed that lesions of the posterior cortices were associated with impaired time orientation, including medial temporal lobes, occipitotemporal cortex, and precuneus (r=0.21, p<.001). Individuals with time disorientation tended to have concomitant impairments in memory, visuospatial ability, and naming. Follow-up analyses of individuals with unilateral lesions and those with relatively unimpaired cognition in other domains implicated the precuneus and parahippocampal gyrus in time orientation. Lesion network mapping demonstrated that these regional findings occurred at nodes of the default mode and visual networks. Individuals with time disorientation tended to have concomitant impairments in memory, visuospatial ability, and naming.\n\nDiscussionWe interpret these findings as novel evidence for the role of posteromedial cortices extending from the precuneus to the medial temporal lobe in supporting time orientation.",

    "abstract": "Viruses contribute to food web dynamics and nutrient cycles in diverse ecosystems, yet the biogeographical patterns that underlie these viral dynamics are poorly understood, particularly in soil. Here, we identified trends in soil viral community composition in relation to habitat, moisture content, and physical distance. We generated 30 soil viromes from four distinct habitats (wetlands, grasslands, woodlands, and chaparral) by selectively capturing virus-sized particles prior to DNA extraction, and we recovered 3,432 unique viral  species (vOTUs). Viral communities differed significantly by soil moisture content, with viral richness generally higher in wet compared to dry soil habitats. However, vOTUs were rarely shared between samples, including replicates <10 m apart, suggesting that soil viruses may not disperse well and that future soil viral community sampling strategies may need to account for extreme community differences over small spatial scales. Of the 19% of vOTUs detected in more than one sample, 93% were from the same habitat and site, suggesting greater viral community similarity in closer proximity and under similar environmental conditions. Within-habitat differences indicate that extensive sampling would be required for rigorous cross-habitat comparisons, and results belie emerging paradigms of higher viral activity in wet soils and soil viral community spatial heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Rapidly proliferating cells produce more ribosomes to translate sufficient proteins for cell growth. One of the first and rate limiting steps in translation initiation is the interaction of the small ribosomal subunit with mRNAs. Therefore, effective small ribosomal subunit biogenesis is critical for translation initiation efficiency. Here we report the identification of the zinc finger protein 692 (ZNF692), a MYC-induced nucleolar scaffold that coordinates the final steps in the biogenesis of the small 40S ribosome. ZNF692 forms a complex with rRNA, the 90S processome and the nucleolar exosome in the granular component of the nucleolus creating a hub specialized in the final steps of 18S processing and small ribosomal subunit maturation. Cancer cells are more reliant on ZNF692 for increased translation than normal cells. We propose that MYC increases translation efficiency by promoting the expression of ZNF692, adjusting the translation rate to the increase in mRNA transcription induced by MYC.",

    "abstract": "The gut peristaltic movement, a wave-like propagation of a local contraction, is important for the transportation and digestion of ingested materials. Among three types of cells, the enteric nervous system (ENS), smooth muscle cells, and interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), the ICCs have been thought to act as a pacemaker, and therefore it is important to decipher the cellular functions of ICCs for the understanding of gut peristalsis. c-Kit, a tyrosine kinase receptor, has widely been used as a marker for ICCs. Most studies with ICCs have been conducted in mammals using commercially available anti-c-Kit antibody. Recently, the chicken embryonic gut has emerged as a powerful model to study the gut peristalsis. However, since the anti-c-Kit antibody for mammals does not work for chickens, cellular mechanisms by which ICCs are regulated have largely been unexplored. Here, we report a newly raised polyclonal antibody against the chicken c-Kit protein. The specificity of the antibody was validated by both Western blotting analyses and immunocytochemistry. Co-immunostaining with the new antibody and anti- smooth muscle actin (SMA) antibody successfully visualized ICCs in the chicken developing hindgut in the circular muscle- and longitudinal muscle layers: as previously shown in mice, common progenitors of ICCs and smooth muscle cells at early stages were double positive for SMA and c-Kit, and at later stages, differentiated ICCs and smooth muscle cells exhibited only c-Kit and SMA, respectively. A novel ICC population was also found that radially extended from the submucosal layer to circular muscle layer. Furthermore, the new antibody delineated individual ICCs in a cleared hindgut. The antibody newly developed in this study will facilitate the study of peristaltic movement in chicken embryos.",

    "abstract": "Human neutrophils respond to multiple chemical attractants to guide their migration from the vasculature to sites of infection and injury, where they clear pathogens and amplify inflammation. To properly focus their responses during this complex navigation, neutrophils distinguish between attractants to modulate their responses. They prioritize pathogen and injury derived signals over long-range inflammatory signals secreted by host cells. Different attractants can also drive qualitatively different modes of migration. As receptors recognizing both classes of attractant couple to Gi G-proteins, it remains unclear how downstream signaling pathways distinguish and prioritize between the inputs. Here, we use live-cell imaging to demonstrate that the responses differ in their signaling dynamics: low priority attractants cause transient responses, while responses to high priority attractants are sustained. We observe this difference in both primary neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 cells, for signaling outputs of calcium, a major regulator of secretion, and Cdc42, a primary regulator of polarity and cell steering. We find that the rapid attenuation of Cdc42 activation in response to LTB4 depends on the threonine 308 and serine 310 phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail of its receptor LTB4R, in a manner independent of endocytosis. Mutation of these residues to alanine impairs attractant prioritization, although it does not affect attractant-dependent differences in migration persistence. Our results indicate that distinct temporal regulation of shared signaling pathways distinguishes receptors and contributes to chemoattractant prioritization.",

    "abstract": "Secreted proteins fulfil a vast array of different functions, including adaptive immunity, cell signalling and extracellular matrix remodelling. In the trans-Golgi network, proteins destined for constitutive secretion are sorted into post-Golgi carriers which fuse with the plasma membrane to deliver their contents to the extracellular space. The molecular machinery involved is poorly understood. Here, we have used kinetic trafficking assays and transient CRISPR knock-outs to study the biosynthetic sorting route from the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane. Depletion of core-exocyst subunits reduces carrier fusion and causes cargo accumulation in the post-Golgi carriers. Exocyst subunits co-localise with carriers fusing at the plasma membrane and we show that the exocyst complex is recruited directly to these carriers. Abrogation of exocyst followed by kinetic trafficking assays with multiple different soluble cargoes results in cargo accumulation of all tested cargoes. Unbiased secretomics reveals a drastic reduction in the secretion of soluble proteins to the extracellular milieu after knock-out of exocyst subunits. Importantly, the knock-out of exocyst subunits in specialised secretory cell types prevents the constitutive secretion of antibodies in lymphocytes and of the hormones leptin and adiponectin in adipocytes. Together these data identify the exocyst complex as the functional tether of secretory post-Golgi carriers at the plasma membrane and an essential component of the mammalian constitutive secretory pathway.",

    "abstract": "During morphogenesis, diverse cell-scale and tissue-scale processes couple to dynamically sculpt organs. In this coupling, genetic expression patterns and biochemical signals regulate and respond to mechanical deformations to ensure reproducible and robust changes in tissue geometry. A long-standing approach to characterize these interactions has been the construction of expression atlases, and these atlases have necessarily relied on fixed snapshots of embryogenesis. Addressing how expression profiles relate to tissue dynamics, however, requires a scheme for spatiotemporal registration across different classes of data that incorporates both live samples and fixed datasets. Here, we construct a morphodynamic atlas that unifies fixed and live datasets - from gene expression profiles to cytoskeletal components - into a single, morphological consensus timeline. This resource and our computational approach to global alignment facilitate hypothesis testing using quantitative comparison of data both within and across ensembles, with resolution in both space and time to relate genes to tissue rearrangement, cell behaviors, and out-of-plane motion. Examination of embryo kinematics reveals stages in which tissue flow patterns are quasi-stationary, arranged as a sequence of  morphodynamic modules. Temperature perturbations tune the duration of one such module - during body axis elongation - according to a simple, parameter-free scaling in which the total integrated tissue deformation is achieved at a temperature-dependent rate. By extending our approach to visceral organ formation during later stages of embryogenesis, we highlight how morphodynamic atlases can incorporate complex shapes deforming in 3D. In this context, morphodynamic modules are reflected in some, but not all, measures of tissue motion. Our approach and the resulting atlas opens up the ability to quantitatively test hypotheses with resolution in both space and time, relating genes to tissue rearrangement, cell behaviors, and organ motion.",

While previous work has estimated base stacking energies between pairs of bases, the individual contributions of each base to the stacking interaction has remained unknown. Here, we developed a novel methodology using a custom Centrifuge Force Microscope to perform high-throughput single molecule experiments to measure base stacking energies between individual adjacent bases. We found stacking energies strongest between purines (G|A at -2.3 {+/-} 0.2 kcal/mol) and weakest between pyrimidines (C|T at -0.4 {+/-} 0.1 kcal/mol). Hybrid stacking with phosphorylated, methylated, and RNA bases had no measurable effect, but a fluorophore modification reduced stacking energy. The implications of the work are demonstrated with three applications. We experimentally show that base stacking design can influence assembly and stability of a DNA nanostructure, modulate kinetics of enzymatic ligation, and determine accuracy of force fields in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Our results provide new insights into fundamental DNA interactions that are critical in biology and can inform rational design in diverse biotechnology applications.",

Furthermore, single-nucleus RNA-sequencing reveals broad transcriptomic changes across DG mature and adult-born cells in response to cholinergic-circuit activation. Notably, neuronal populations exhibit cholinergic-activity-induced molecular changes related to synaptic functions crucial for spatial memory; while rNSCs exhibit changes related to structural remodeling and neurogenic proliferation crucial for hippocampal neurogenesis. Electrophysiology and NicheNet analyses reveal granule cells, endothelial cells, and astrocytes as potential intermediaries for cholinergic regulation of rNSCs.

    "abstract": "To investigate the diversity, distribution, persistence, and prevalence of stress survival and resistance genes of Listeria monocytogenes clones dominating in food processing environments in Norway, genome sequences from 769 L. monocytogenes isolates from food industry environments, foods, and raw materials (of which 512 were sequenced in the present study) were subjected to wgMLST, SNP, and comparative genomic analyses. The dataset comprised isolates from nine meat and six salmon processing facilities in Norway collected over a period of three decades. The most prevalent clonal complex (CC) was CC121, found in ten factories, followed by CC7, CC8, and CC9, found in seven factories each. Overall, 72% of the isolates were classified as persistent, showing 20 or fewer wgMLST allelic differences towards an isolate found in the same factory in a different calendar year. Moreover, over half of the isolates (56%) showed this level of genetic similarity towards an isolate collected from a different food processing facility. These were designated as pervasive strains, defined as clusters with the same level of genetic similarity as persistent strains but isolated from different factories. The prevalence of genetic determinants associated with increased survival in food processing environments, including heavy metal and biocide resistance determinants, stress response genes and inlA truncation mutations, showed a highly significant increase among pervasive isolates, but not among persistent isolates. Furthermore, these genes were significantly more prevalent among the isolates from food processing environments compared to in isolates from natural and rural environments (n=218) and clinical isolates (n=111) from Norway.\n\nImportanceListeria monocytogenes can persist in food processing environments for months to decades and spread through the food system by e.g., contaminated raw materials. Knowledge about the distribution and diversity of L. monocytogenes is of importance in outbreak investigations and essential to effectively track and control this pathogen in the food system. The current study presents a comprehensive overview of the prevalence of persistent clones and of the diversity of L. monocytogenes in Norwegian food processing facilities. The results demonstrate extensive spread of highly similar strains throughout the Norwegian food system, in that 56% of the 769 collected isolates from food processing factories belonged to clusters of L. monocytogenes identified in more than one facility. These strains were associated with an overall increase in the prevalence of plasmids and determinants of heavy metal and biocide resistance as well as other genetic elements associated with stress survival mechanisms and persistence.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a brain disorder originating during neurodevelopment with complex genetic and environmental etiologies. Despite decades of clinical evidence of altered striatal function in affected patients, its cellular and molecular underpinnings remain unclear. Here, to explore neurodevelopmental alterations in the striatum associated with SCZ, we established a method for the differentiation of iPS cells into ventral forebrain organoids. Given substantial genetic heterogeneity among individuals, which can obscure disease-associated phenotypes, we generated organoids from postmortem dural fibroblast-derived iPS cells of 3 patients and 4 healthy control individuals with nonoverlapping polygenic risk score (PRS) for SCZ and whose genotype and postmortem caudate transcriptomic data were profiled in the Brainseq neurogenomics consortium. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analyses of the organoids revealed differences in developmental trajectory between SCZ cases and controls in which inhibitory neurons from patients exhibited accelerated maturation. Furthermore, we found a significant overlap of genes upregulated in the inhibitory neurons in SCZ organoids with upregulated genes in postmortem caudate tissues from patients with SCZ compared with control individuals, including the donors of our iPS cell cohort. Our findings suggest that striatal neurons in the patients with SCZ carry abnormalities that originated during early brain development and a ventral forebrain striatal organoid model can recapitulate those neurodevelopmental phenotypes in a dish.",

We previously described the human single-chain scFv76 antibody, which recognizes SARS-CoV-2 Alfa, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants.

Cryo-EM analysis reveals that scFv76 binds to a well-conserved SARS-CoV-2 spike epitope, providing the structural basis for its broad-spectrum activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that nebulized scFv76 exhibits therapeutic efficacy in a severe hACE2 transgenic mouse model of COVID-19 pneumonia, as shown by body weight and pulmonary viral load data. Counteraction of infection correlates with the inhibition of lung inflammation observed by histopathology and expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Biomarkers of pulmonary endothelial damage were also significantly reduced in scFv76-treated mice. Altogether the results support the use of nebulized scFv76 for COVID-19 induced by any SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged so far.",

Broadly neutralizing antibodies with high potency against Omicron are urgently needed for understanding working mechanisms and developing therapeutic agents. In this study, we characterized previously reported F61, which was isolated from convalescent patients infected with prototype SARS-CoV-2, as a broadly neutralizing antibody against all VOCs including Omicron BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2, BA.3 and BA.4 sublineages by utilizing antigen binding and cell infection assays. We also identified and characterized another broadly neutralizing antibody D2 with epitope distinct from that of F61. More importantly, we showed that a combination of F61 with D2 exhibited synergy in neutralization and protecting mice from SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron BA.1 variants.

In addition to vaccines, research and development have also been directed towards novel drugs. Since the highly glycosylated spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for infection, it constitutes a prime target for antiviral agents. The pineapple-derived jacalin-related lectin (AcmJRL) is present in the medication bromelain in significant quantities and has previously been described to bind mannosides. Here, we elucidated its ligand specificity by glycan array analysis, quantified the interaction with carbohydrates and validated high-mannose glycans as preferred ligands. Because the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was previously reported to carry a high proportion of high-mannose N-glycans, we tested the binding of AcmJRL to recombinantly produced spike protein. We could demonstrate that AcmJRL binds the spike protein with a low micromolar KD in a carbohydrate-dependent fashion, suggesting its use as a potential SARS-CoV-2 neutralising agent.",

    "abstract": "Viruses play a central role in all ecological niches; the origin of viruses, however, remains an open question. While phylogenetic analysis of distantly related viruses is hampered by a lack of detectable sequence similarity, structural biology can reveal conserved capsid protein structures that facilitate the study of distant evolutionary relationships. Here, we characterize the lipid-containing ssDNA temperate bacteriophage {Phi}CjT23, which is infecting Flavobacterium sp. (Bacteroidetes). We further detected {Phi}CjT23-like sequences in the genome of strains belonging to several Flavobacterium species. The virion structure determined by cryogenic electron microscopy revealed similarities to members of the viral kingdom Bamfordvirae that currently consists solely of dsDNA viruses. Common to these viruses, infecting hosts from all domains of life, is a major capsid protein composed of two upright {beta}-sandwiches. The minimalistic structure of {Phi}CjT23 suggests that this phage serves as a model for the last common ancestor between ssDNA and dsDNA viruses in the Bamfordvirae. Both {Phi}CjT23 and the related phage FLiP infect Flavobacterium species found in several environments, suggesting that these types of viruses have a global distribution and shared evolutionary origin. Detailed comparisons to related, more complex viruses not only expand our knowledge about this group of viruses but also provide a rare glimpse into early virus evolution.",

    "abstract": "Pertussis, commonly known as whooping cough is a severe respiratory disease caused by the bacterium, Bordetella pertussis. Despite widespread vaccination, pertussis resurgence has been observed globally. The development of the current acellular vaccine (ACV) has been based on planktonic studies. However, recent studies have shown that B. pertussis readily forms biofilms. A better understanding of B. pertussis biofilms is important for developing novel vaccines that can target all aspects of B. pertussis infection. This study compared the proteomic expression of biofilm and planktonic B. pertussis cells to identify key changes between the conditions. Major differences were identified in virulence factors including an upregulation of toxins (adenylate cyclase toxin and dermonecrotic toxin) and downregulation of pertactin and type III secretion system proteins in biofilm cells. To further dissect metabolic pathways that are altered during the biofilm lifestyle, the proteomic data was then incorporated into a genome scale metabolic model using the integrative metabolic analysis tool (iMAT). The analysis revealed that planktonic cells utilised the glyoxylate shunt while biofilm cells completed the full tricarboxylic acid cycle. Differences in processing aspartate, arginine and alanine were identified as well as unique export of valine out of biofilm cells which may have a role in inter-bacterial communication and regulation. Finally, increased polyhydroxybutyrate accumulation and superoxide dismutase activity in biofilm cells may contribute to increased persistence during infection. Taken together, this study modelled major proteomic and metabolic changes that occur in biofilm cells which helps lay the groundwork for further understanding B. pertussis pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) are major pathogens globally. It is unknown whether bloodstream infections (BSIs) by CRKP and other bacteria are commonly caused by single organisms or mixed microbial populations. We hypothesized that contemporaneous CRKP from blood cultures of individual patients are genetically and phenotypically distinct. We determined short-read whole genome sequences of 10 strains from single colonies from CRKP-positive blood cultures in each of 6 patients (Illumina HiSeq). All strains were sequence type (ST)-258 K. pneumoniae that were unique by core genome single nucleotide polymorphism phylogeny, antibiotic resistance and virulence genes, capsular polysaccharide (CPS) gene mutations, and/or plasmid loss. Strains from each of 3 patients that differed in antibiotic resistance, virulence and/or CPS gene content underwent long-read sequencing for genome completion (Oxford Nanopore), and were tested for phenotypes in vitro and pathogenicity during mouse BSIs. Genetically distinct strains within individual patients exhibited significant differences in carbapenem, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and other antibiotic responses, CPS production, mucoviscosity, and susceptibility to serum killing. In 2 patients, strains differed significantly in their ability to infect organs and cause mortality in mice. In conclusion, we identified genotypic and phenotypic variant ST258 K. pneumoniae strains from blood cultures of individual patients, which were not detected by the clinical laboratory at time of BSI diagnosis. The data support a new paradigm of CRKP population diversity during BSIs. If validated for other BSIs, within-host bacterial diversity may have profound implications for medical, microbiology laboratory and infection prevention practices, and for understanding emergence of antibiotic resistance and pathogenesis.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn processing positive microbiologic cultures, standard clinical laboratory practice is to test a single bacterial strain from each morphologically distinct colony. We performed comprehensive whole genome sequence analyses on 10 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) strains from positive blood cultures from each of 6 patients. Our findings that all strains were genetically unique and that genetic variants manifested differences in phenotypes like antibiotic responsiveness and virulence suggest that CRKP bloodstream infections may be commonly caused by mixed bacterial populations. Results raise questions about laboratory protocols and treatment decisions that are directed against a single strain. The observation that pan-genome analyses revealed inter-strain differences that were not evident by studying core genomes has important implications for investigating nosocomial outbreaks and transmission. Data also suggest a model of pathogenesis of CRKP infections, in which environmental pressures in vivo may select for outgrowth of variants that manifest antibiotic resistance, tolerance or specific virulence attributes.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial biofilms are surface-attached communities that are difficult to eradicate due to a high tolerance to antimicrobial agents. The use of non-biocidal surface-active compounds to prevent the initial adhesion and aggregation of bacterial pathogens is a promising alternative to antibiotic treatments and several antibiofilm compounds have been identified, including some capsular polysaccharides released by various bacteria. However, the lack of chemical and mechanistic understanding of the activity of these high-molecular-weight polymers limits their use for control of biofilm formation. Here, we screened a collection of 32 purified capsular polysaccharides and identified seven new compounds with non-biocidal activity against biofilms formed by Escherichia coli and/or Staphylococcus aureus. We analyzed the polysaccharide mobility under applied electric field conditions and showed that active and inactive polysaccharide polymers display distinct electrokinetic properties and that all active macromolecules shared high intrinsic viscosity features. Based on these characteristics, we identified two additional antibiofilm capsular polysaccharides with high density of electrostatic charges and their permeability to fluid flow. Our study therefore provides insights into key biophysical properties discriminating active from inactive polysaccharides. This characterization of a specific electrokinetic signature for polysaccharides displaying antibiofilm activity opens new perspectives to identify or engineer non-biocidal surface-active macromolecules to control biofilm formation in medical and industrial settings.\n\nSignificance statementSome bacteria produce non-biocidal capsular polysaccharides that reduce the adhesion of bacterial pathogens to surfaces. Due to a lack of molecular and structural definition, the basis of their antiadhesion activity is unknown, thus hindering their prophylactic use for biofilm control. Here, we identified nine new active compounds and compared their composition, structure and biophysical properties with other inactive capsular polysaccharides. Despite the absence of specific molecular motif, we demonstrate that all active polysaccharides share common electrokinetic properties that distinguish them from inactive polymers. This characterization of the biophysical properties of antibiofilm bacterial polysaccharide provides key insights to engineer non-biocidal and bio-inspired surface-active compounds to control bacterial adhesion in medical and industrial settings.",

    "abstract": "Urinary tract infections (UTIs), mostly caused by uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), are common bacterial infections that affect a majority of women and often recur. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses have not identified a common set of virulence genes which has suggested conserved virulence functions instead of virulence genes, multiple virulence mechanisms, and complex host-pathogen interactions. One aspect of the host-pathogen interaction is rapid UPEC growth in urine in vivo. When bacteria are grown in pooled urine, an averaged urine is assumed to diminish individual variation. We grew a non-pathogenic and pathogenic E. coli strains in urine from individuals who never had a UTI, had a UTI history but no current infection, and had a UTI history with a current infection. Bacterial growth showed large variations in individual urines and pooled urine supported significantly more growth than predicted for never and history groups but not the current group. UPEC strains, but not the non-pathogenic strain, were resistant to urinary inhibitory factors e.g., antimicrobial peptides based on an indirect inoculation-density effect assay. Total nutrient content tended to be higher in current group urine than never and history group urine. We propose that pooling optimizes a nutrient mixture in never and history group urines, which are often studied, whereas urine from current group individuals appear to have a more optimal nutrient mixture. We conclude that pooled urine is not \"an average urine\", and that the best comparisons of results between labs using pooled urine would also include results with a standardized synthetic urine.",

    "abstract": "Cellular organisms purge lethal mutations as they occur (in haploids), or as soon as they become homozygous (in sexually reproducing diploids), thus making the mutation-carrying genomes the sole victims of lethality. How lethal mutations in viruses are purged remains an unresolved question because numerous viral genomes could potentially replicate in the same cell, sharing their encoded proteins, hence shielding lethal mutations from selection. Previous investigations by us and others suggest that viruses with plus strand (+) RNA genomes may compel such selection by bottlenecking the replicating genome copies in each cell to low single digits. However, it is unclear if similar bottlenecks also occur in cells invaded by DNA viruses. Here we investigated whether tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), a small virus with a single-stranded DNA genome, underwent population bottlenecking in cells of its host plants. We engineered the TYLCV genome to produce two replicons that express green fluorescent protein and mCherry, respectively, in a replication-dependent manner. We found that less than 65% of cells penetrated by both replicons replicated both, whereas at least 35% of cells replicated either of them alone, illustrating an intracellular population bottleneck size of no more than three. Furthermore, sequential inoculations unveiled strong mutual exclusions of these two replicons in most cells. Collectively our data demonstrated for the first time that DNA viruses like TYLCV are subject to stringent intracellular population bottlenecks, suggesting that such population bottlenecks may be a virus-encoded, evolutionarily conserved trait that assures timely elimination of lethal mutations.\n\nSignificance statementAn important unresolved issue in virus life cycles is how natural selection acts on individual virus copies in the same cells. Unlike cellular organisms in which genome copies with lethal or advantageous mutations usually share their hosts with no more than one homologous genome copy, viruses could potentially reproduce with numerous sister genomes per cell, permitting sharing of protein products, thereby greatly diminishing phenotypic impacts of otherwise eventful mutations. Previous investigations suggest that (+) RNA viruses solve this problem by bottlenecking the number of replicating genome copies to low single digits. The current study reveals strikingly similar intracellular population bottlenecks for a DNA virus. Further mechanistic interrogations could avail the virus-encoded bottleneck-enforcing apparatus as targets for antiviral therapy and prevention.",

    "abstract": "Poplar is an important tree species for ecological protection, wood production, bioenergy and urban greening; it has been widely planted worldwide. However, the catkin fibers produced by female poplars can cause environmental pollution and safety hazards during spring. This study focused on Populus tomentosa, and revealed the sucrose metabolism regulatory mechanism of catkin fibers development from morphological, physiological and molecular aspects. Paraffin section suggested that poplar catkin fibers were not seed hairs and produced from the epidermal cells of funicle and placenta. Sucrose degradation via invertase and sucrose synthase played the dominant role during poplar catkin fibers development. The expression patterns revealed that sucrose metabolism-related genes played important roles during catkin fibers development. Y1H analysis indicated that there was a potential interaction between sucrose synthase 2 (PtoSUS2)/vacuolar invertase 3 (PtoVIN3) and MYB/ bHLH transcription factors in poplar. Finally, the two key genes, PtoSUS2 and PtoVIN3, had roles in Arabidopsis trichome density, indicating that sucrose metabolism is important in poplar catkin fibers development. This study is not only helpful for clarifying the mechanism of sucrose regulation during trichome development in perennial woody plants, but also establishes a foundation to solve poplar catkin fibers pollution through genetic engineering methods.\n\nHighlightSucrose degradation via invertase and sucrose synthase plays an important role in poplar catkin fibers development, and PtoSUS2 and PtoVIN3 are potential promising targets to solve poplar catkin fibers pollution.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global public health threat. Surveillance of AMR requires affordable, rapid, and user-friendly diagnostic method. Our aim was to develop a low-cost thermocycler to perform polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n\nMethodsWe developed a smartphone-operated PCR thermal cycler using locally available recycled materials. The thermal cycler was used for the amplification for three bacterial genes - bla-TEM and bla-CTXM and 16s rRNA in human urine samples. The performance of custom-built thermal cycler was compared with the commercial one.\n\nResultsThe thermal cycler was portable (<1kg weight), required 12 V power supply, 25 {micro}L of solution, and cost only USD50.0. Temperature and time conditions were instructed using a custom-built smartphone application. The ramping rate of was 0.23{degrees}C for heating and 0.43{degrees}C for cooling, set temperatures were within {+/-} 0.5 {degrees}C of target showing a good thermal stability. The antibiotic sensitivity test of human urine samples showed they were highly resistance and multi-resistant. Nearly 46 % (n=54) E. coli isolates were positive in ESBL screening test. The custom-built thermocycler was able to accurately predict the presence of bla-TEM and bla-CTXM genes (n=6).\n\nConclusionsWe developed and demonstrated a portable, low-cost, easy-to-use, and smartphone-operated PCR thermal cycler. Since it is portable, it can be used in remote location and field settings, including places without stable power supply. The use of the thermal cycler system can be extended, beyond the detection of AMR genes, e.g., in clinical diagnosis, genetics, forensic analysis, and environmental protection.",

    "abstract": "The lung is an understudied site of HIV persistence. We isolated 882 subgenomic proviral sequences by single-genome approaches from blood and lung from nine individuals on long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART), and characterized genetic diversity and compartmentalization using formal tests. Consistent with clonal expansion as a driver of HIV persistence, identical sequences comprised between 9% to 86% of within-host datasets, though their location (blood vs. lung) followed no consistent pattern. The majority (77%) of participants harbored at least one sequence shared across blood and lung, supporting the migration of clonally-expanded cells between sites. No participant exhibited genetic compartmentalization so obvious that it was visually apparent in a phylogeny. When formal tests were applied however, two (22%) participants showed modest yet significant support for compartmentalization when analysis was restricted to distinct proviruses per site. This increased to four participants (44%) when considering all within-host sequences. Thus, while a minority of individuals harbor somewhat distinctive proviral populations in blood and lung, these can simply be due to unequal distributions of clonally-expanded sequences. Importantly, the extent of lung proviral diversity on ART strongly reflected that in blood (Spearman {rho} = 0.98, p < 0.0001), confirming blood as a strong indicator of total body proviral diversity. Analysis of on-ART proviral diversity in context of pre-therapy viral diversity in two participants revealed marked differences in proviral longevity and dynamics. Whereas one participants proviral pool was rich in ancestral sequences that recapitulated more of HIVs within-host evolutionary history, the others largely comprised more contemporary sequences, including ones that re-seeded the reservoir during a three-year treatment interruption. Results highlight the genetic complexity of proviruses persisting in lung and blood during ART, and the uniqueness of each individuals proviral composition. Individualized HIV remission and cure strategies may be needed to overcome these challenges.\n\nAuthor SummaryHIV persists in the body despite long-term suppressive antiretroviral therapy. Much of our knowledge about the HIV reservoir comes from studying proviruses in blood, but a fundamental question is whether these are distinct from those in tissues. The lung could theoretically engender genetically distinctive HIV populations, but this remains understudied. Our analysis of nearly 900 proviral sequences from blood and lung of nine individuals with HIV receiving long-term therapy revealed substantial within-host heterogeneity, yet some common patterns. Identical sequences (consistent with clonal expansion of infected cells) were observed in everyone, though at different (9-86%) frequencies. Recovery of shared sequences across blood and lung was common (77% of participants). Fewer than half of participants exhibited blood-lung genetic compartmentalization, and only modestly so. Moreover, when present, compartmentalization was often attributable to differential distribution of identical sequences, not the presence of genetically distinctive populations, across sites. Results also revealed marked inter-individual differences in proviral dynamics, as evidenced by the proportion of persisting proviruses that represented ancestral versus more recently-circulating viral sequences. Critically, the extent of within-host proviral diversity in blood correlated strongly with that in lung, indicating that despite inter-individual heterogeneity, blood is a strong indicator of proviral diversity elsewhere in the body.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence implicates liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), the condensation of biomolecules into liquid-like droplets in the formation and dissolution of membraneless intracellular organelles (MLOs). Eukaryotic cells utilize MLOs or condensates for various biological processes, including emergency signaling, spatiotemporal control over steady-state biochemical reactions and heterochromatin formation. Insulator proteins function as architectural elements involved in establishing independent domains of transcriptional activity within eukaryotic genomes. In Drosophila, insulator proteins coalesce to form nuclear foci known as insulator bodies in response to osmotic stress and during apoptosis. However, the mechanism through which insulator proteins assemble into bodies and whether these bodies confer any genome function are yet to be fully investigated. Here, we identify signatures of liquid-liquid phase separation by insulator bodies, including high disorder tendency in insulator proteins, scaffold-client dependent assembly, extensive fusion behavior, sphericity, and sensitivity to 1,6-hexanediol. We also show that the cohesin subunit Rad21 is a component of insulator bodies adding to the known insulator proteins and the histone variant {gamma}H2Av constituents. Our data suggest a concerted role of cohesin and insulator proteins in insulator body formation and under physiological conditions. We propose a mechanism whereby these architectural proteins modulate 3D genome organization through LLPS.",

Yet to date, the benefits of in vivo reprogramming are limited by the occurrence of detrimental side-effects. Here, using complementary genetic approaches, we demonstrated that continuous in vivo induction of the reprogramming factors leads to hepatic and intestinal dysfunction resulting in decreased body weight and premature death. By generating a novel transgenic reprogrammable mouse strain, which avoids OSKM expression in both liver and intestine, we drastically reduced the early lethality and adverse effects associated with in vivo reprogramming. This new reprogramming mouse allows safe and long-term continuous induction of OSKM and might enable a better understanding of in vivo reprogramming as well as maximize its potential effects on rejuvenation and regeneration.",

    "abstract": "S-acylation is a reversible posttranslational protein modification consisting of attachment of a fatty acid to a cysteine via a thioester bond. Research over the last few years has shown that a variety of different fatty acids, such as C16:0, C18:0 or C18:1, are used in cells to S-acylate proteins. We recently showed that GNAI proteins can be acylated on a single residue, Cys3, with either C16:0 or C18:1 and that the relative proportion of acylation with these fatty acids depends on the level of the respective fatty acid in the cells environment. This has functional consequences for GNAI proteins, with the identity of the acylating fatty acid affecting the subcellular localization of GNAIs. Unclear is whether this competitive acylation is specific to GNAI proteins or a more general phenomenon in the proteome. We perform here a proteome screen to identify proteins acylated with different fatty acids. We identify 218 proteins acylated with C16:0 and 308 proteins acylated with C18-lipids, thereby uncovering novel targets of acylation. We find that most proteins that can be acylated by palmitic acid (C16:0) can also be acylated with C18-fatty acids. For proteins with more than one acylation site, we find that this competitive acylation occurs on each individual cysteine residue. This raises the possibility that the function of many different proteins can be regulated by the lipid environment via differential S-acylation.",

    "abstract": "The failure of metabolic tissues to appropriately respond to insulin (\"insulin resistance\") is an early marker in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Protein phosphorylation is central to the adipocyte insulin response, but how adipocyte signaling networks are dysregulated upon insulin resistance is unknown. Here we employed phosphoproteomics to delineate insulin signal transduction in adipocyte cells and adipose tissue. Across a range of insults triggering insulin resistance, we observed marked rewiring of the insulin signaling network. This included both attenuated insulin-responsive phosphorylation, and the emergence of phosphorylation uniquely insulin-regulated in insulin resistance. Identifying signaling changes common to multiple insults revealed subnetworks likely containing causal drivers of insulin resistance. Focusing on defective GSK3 signaling initially observed in a relatively small subset of well-characterized substrates, we employed a pipeline for identifying context-specific kinase substrates. This facilitated robust identification of widespread dysregulated GSK3 signaling. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 partially reversed insulin resistance in cells and tissue explants. These data highlight that insulin resistance is a multi-nodal signaling defect that encompasses dysregulated GSK3 activity.",

    "abstract": "Measuring cellular and tissue mechanics inside intact living organisms is essential for interrogating the roles of force in physiological and disease processes, and is a major goal in the field of mechanobiology. However, existing biosensors for 3D tissue mechanics, primarily based on fluorescent emissions and deformable materials, are limited for in vivo measurement due to the limited light penetration and poor material stability inside intact, living organisms. While magneto-motive ultrasound (MMUS), which uses superparamagnetic nanoparticles as imaging contrast agents, has emerged as a promising modality for real-time in vivo imaging of tissue mechanics, it has poor sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution. To overcome these limitations, we introduce magneto-gas vesicles (MGVs), a unique class of protein nanostructures based on gas vesicles and magnetic nanoparticles that produces differential ultrasound signals in response to varying mechanical properties of surrounding tissues. These hybrid protein nanostructures significantly improve signal strength and detection sensitivity. Furthermore, MGVs enable non-invasive, long-term, and quantitative measurement of mechanical properties within 3D tissues and organs in vivo. We demonstrated the performance of MGV-based mechano-sensors in vitro, in fibrosis models of organoids, and in vivo in mouse liver fibrosis models.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe ongoing pandemic of COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), poses a serious threat to global public health and imposes a severe burden on the entire human population. Faced with a virus that can mutate its structure while immunity is incapacitated, a need to develop a universal vaccine that can boost immunity to coronaviruses is highly needed.\n\nDesignFive formulations of two types (CRCx2 and CRCx3) of immune complexes with an immunogen adjuvant were evaluated in a mouse model as candidate SARS CoV-2 vaccines in a pretrial prior to clinical trials in humans. CRCx3 comprises 3 different formulas and CRCx2 comprises 2. Balb/c mice were vaccinated intraperitoneally on days 0/7 with a high or low dose of CRCx2 or on days 0/7/14 with a high, medium, or low dose of CRCx3 series, and their blood was sampled for serum antibody measurements. Mice were challenged with live virus after immunization with either vaccine to evaluate prophylaxis ability or treated with them after challenge to evaluate therapeutic ability on day 15. Immunological markers and histopathological studies as well as titration of neutralizing antibodies to the vaccines were evaluated and analyzed.\n\nResultsCRCx 3 and CRCx 2 vaccine candidates induced elevated levels of positive neutralizing antibodies as well as a cellular immune response with safety, efficient productivity, and good genetic stability for vaccine manufacturing to provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 with relatively higher levels with the high dose CRCx2 candidate combination.\n\nConclusionsHighly efficient protection and therapeutic effect against SARS-CoV-2 were obtained with a double-dose immunization schedule spaced at 7-day intervals using injections 0.25 of or 0.40 ml of CRCx2 vaccine formulations with a 25-mm needle. These results support further evaluation of CRCx in a clinical trial on humans.",

    "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that the environment-sensing transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) is an important regulator of hematopoiesis. Yet, the mechanisms and extent of AHR-mediated regulation within the most primitive hematopoietic cells, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), are poorly understood. Through a combination of transcriptomic and flow cytometric approaches, this study provides new insight into how the AHR influences HSPCs. Comparative analysis of intraphenotypic transcriptomes of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitor (MPP) cells from AHR knockout (AHR KO) and wild-type (WT) mice revealed significant differences in gene expression patterns. Notable among these were differences in expression of cell cycle regulators, specifically an enrichment of G2/M checkpoint genes when Ahr was absent. This included the regulator Aurora A kinase (Aurka, AurA). Interrogation of AurA protein levels in HSPC subsets using flow cytometry, in combination with inducible AHR KO or in vivo AHR antagonism showed that attenuation of AHR increased levels of AurA in HSCs and lineage-biased MPP cells. Overall, these data highlight a potential novel mechanism by which AHR controls HSC homeostasis and HSPC differentiation. These findings advance the understanding of how AHR influences and regulates primitive hematopoiesis.\n\nHighlights (max 85 characters)O_LIAHR alters gene expression during HSC-MPP transition.\nC_LIO_LITranscriptomic analysis shows AHR regulation of key G2/M phase regulators\nC_LIO_LIInducible AHR KO mice show increased AurA levels in HSPC populations\nC_LIO_LIAcute antagonism of AHR increased AurA levels across multiple HSPC populations\nC_LI",

Because humans are exposed to numerous microbes and environmental agents, specific relationships between HCMV and FcR{gamma}-deficient NK cells (also known as g-NK cells) have been challenging to define. Here, we show that a subgroup of rhesus cytomegalovirus (RhCMV)-seropositive macaques possesses FcR{gamma}-deficient NK cells that stably persist and display phenotype resembling human FcR{gamma}-deficient NK cells. Moreover, these macaque NK cells resembled human FcR{gamma}-deficient NK cells with respect to functional characteristics, including enhanced responsiveness to RhCMV-infected target in an antibody-dependent manner and hypo-responsiveness to tumor and cytokine stimulation. These cells were not detected in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) macaques free of RhCMV and six other viruses; however, experimental infection of SPF animals with RhCMV strain UCD59, but not RhCMV strain 68-1 or SIV, led to induction of FcR{gamma}-deficient NK cells. In non-SPF macaques, co-infection by RhCMV with other common viruses was associated with higher frequencies of FcR{gamma}-deficient NK cells. These results support a causal role for specific cytomegalovirus strain(s) in the induction of FcR{gamma}-deficient NK cells, and suggest that co-infection by other viruses further expands this memory-like NK cell pool.",

Importantly, signaling through the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) is required for viral clearance from the heart.

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium that is the leading cause of hospital-acquired gastroenteritis in the US. In the gut milieu, C. difficile encounters microbiota-derived bile acids capable of inhibiting its growth, which are thought to be a mechanism of colonization resistance. While the levels of certain bile acids in the gut correlate with susceptibility to C. difficile infection, their molecular targets in C. difficile remain unknown. In this study, we sought to use chemical proteomics to identify bile acid-interacting proteins in C. difficile. Using photoaffinity bile acid probes and chemical proteomics, we identified a previously uncharacterized MerR family protein, CD3583 (now BapR), as a putative bile acid-sensing transcription regulator. Our data indicate that BapR binds and is stabilized by lithocholic acid (LCA) in C. difficile. Although loss of BapR did not affect C. difficiles sensitivity to LCA, {Delta}bapR cells elongated more in the presence of LCA compared to wild-type cells. Transcriptomics revealed that BapR regulates the expression of the gene clusters mdeA-cd3573 and cd0618-cd0616, and cwpV, with the expression of the mdeA-cd3573 locus being specifically de-repressed in the presence of LCA in a BapR-dependent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed that BapR directly binds to the mdeA promoter region. Since mdeA is involved in amino acid-related sulfur metabolism and the mdeA-cd3573 locus encodes putative transporters, we propose that BapR senses a gastrointestinal tract-specific small molecule, LCA, as an environmental cue for metabolic adaptation.",

    "abstract": "Polyamines are molecules involved in macrophage activation and polarization in response to pathogens. The interaction with Leishmania promotes modulation of macrophage immune response to favor arginine deviation to polyamines production, leading to parasite survival. Polyamine levels are a potential modulator of growth factors, driving cells to proliferation, wound healing, oxidative stress, or regulating translation. Here, we investigate the impact of L-arginine and polyamines in the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in arginine metabolization and pro-inflammatory response to L. amazonensis in murine BALB/c macrophages. We found that supplementation with L-arginine is insufficient to modulate macrophage gene expression and infection. Polyamine supplementation altered nitric oxide synthase (Nos2) and nitric oxide (NO) production, as well as other macrophage enzymes. Putrescine supplementation increased transcript levels of polyamine metabolism-related genes Arginase 2 (Arg2), Spermidine synthase (SpdS), and Spermine synthase (SpmS) in both uninfected and L. amazonensis infected macrophages. Putrescine increased Nos2 expression without leading to NO production, while L-arginine plus spermine led to production of NO in uninfected macrophages. Besides, L-arginine supplementation reduced the levels of Il-1b during infection, and L-arginine or L-arginine plus putrescine increased Mcp1 at 24h of infection. The percentage of infected macrophages was lower after putrescine, spermidine, and spermine supplementation than L-arginine supplementation. Our data showed that the polyamines shift L-arginine-metabolism related-genes on BALB/c macrophages and affect infection by L. amazonensis.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWExtracellular vesicles (EVs) released from the epididymal epithelium (epididymosomes) impart functional competence on sperm as they transit the epididymis by merging with sperm and releasing a complex repertoire of molecules. The cargo of epididymosomes includes small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) that are modified by external factors such as stress, nutrition, and drug use. If incorporated into sperm, the EV sncRNA cargo can affect offspring and lead to heritable phenotypes. In the current study we characterized the RNA contents of EVs collected from the caput epididymis of adult male rats in order to fill a gap in knowledge in this species and to establish a sncRNA profile. Small RNAs of EVs were isolated from the caput portion of the epididymis of adult male rats, and sequenced on a NovaSeq 6000 on a SP flow cell in a single-end 50 bp configuration. The resulting reads were checked for quality, trimmed for adapter sequences, aligned to the unmasked rat genome (Rnor 6), and assigned an annotation designation. The majority of RNA reads aligned to either tRNA fragments (79.1%) or piRNA (18.1%) loci. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) accounted for a surprisingly small proportion of reads (0.18%). The third largest category of aligned reads (1.5%) was in intergenic space and not strictly associated with canonical sncRNA loci. In-depth investigation determined these latter reads ([~]19 nt) aligned strictly within the boundaries of known CpG islands (CpGi), which have not previously been reported to express any form of sncRNA. These newly described \"CpGi sRNAs\" could not consistently be accounted for by overlaying features of any other annotation type (including rRNA and piRNA). The CpGi sRNAs have characteristics of RNA fragments that can associate with the Argonaute/PIWI family of proteins and therefore could have regulatory function via RNA induced silencing or de novo DNA methylation. We propose that CpGi sRNAs constitute a new family of sncRNA that may represent an important and unreported class of regulatory RNA in gametes.",

Here we use TOPmentation (Transcription factor-OPtimized ChIPmentation) to probe enhancer usage in primary MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We find that MLL-AF4, commonly held to promote transcription by binding to gene promoters, is also present at many active enhancers, where it assembles a complex of transcriptional co-activators normally found in the gene body. This includes DOT1L, ENL, PAF1, and a newly identified interaction with the histone chaperone FACT. By chemical degradation, we demonstrate that PAF1 and FACT are required for enhancer activity, including maintaining histone H3K27 acetylation, enhancer RNA transcription and enhancer-promoter interactions. This work identifies novel roles for PAF1 and FACT in enhancer function, and reveals an enhancer-targeting mechanism by which MLL-AF4 upregulates transcription, recruiting transcription machinery through a network of multivalent interactions to control enhancer activity and gene expression in acute leukemias.",

    "abstract": "The green peach aphid, Myzus persicae (Sulzer) is a generalist pest of various host plants, whose feeding preference and growth performance mainly depends on the quantity and quality of nutrients and defensive metabolites in host plants. Here, we studied the preference and performance of M. persicae on three major Brassicaceae vegetables in China and measured nutrient (amino acids) and defensive (glucosinolates) metabolites in these plants. We found that M. persicae preferred and performed better on Chinese cabbage than cabbage and radish, which may be due to the relatively higher concentration of amino acids and lower levels of glucosinolates in their leaves. The glucosinolates level in cabbage leaves was ten times higher than the other two plants, while the amino acid concentration in radish was only half of the cabbage or Chinese cabbage. The higher concentration of glucosinolates in cabbage and lower levels of amino acids in radish may account for the poorer preference and growth of M. persicae on these two plants. These results suggest that both amino acids and glucosinolates in plants are important determinants of the preference and performance of M. persicae, which provide new knowledge for the cultivation and breeding of Brassicaceae vegetables.",

    "abstract": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and Metabolic syndrome (MS) have become a global health concern as incidence of these metabolic disorders is growing rapidly in developing countries particularly in the Middle East, South America and Africa. Studies have shown that protein restriction is associated with increased risk of metabolic diseases, possibly through effects on fatty acid (FA) metabolism. In the present study, we investigated whether a low protein diet modulates FA metabolism and whether methyl donor supplementation can ameliorate these effects and improve metabolic health. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a low protein diet (LPD, 90 g/kg protein, n=8), a LPD supplemented with methyl donors (MD-LPD; choline chloride, betaine, methionine, folic acid, vitamin B12, n=8) or normal protein diet (NPD, 180 g/kg protein, n=8) for 7 weeks prior to analysis of serum fatty acid profiles by GC FID and MS and liver fatty acid synthesis and uptake gene expression by RT-qPCR. We observed significant depletion of serum C15:0 and C17:0 in LPD-fed males compared to NPD. Serum long chain saturated FAs C18:0 and C24:0 were increased in LPD male mice compared to NPD. Gene expression analysis revealed an upregulation of hepatic cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) expression in LPD mice compared to NPD suggesting increased fat uptake in the liver. However, when LPD diet was supplemented with methyl donors, we observed either no change in serum C15: 0 and an increased serum C17:0 compared to LPD with no methyl donor supplementation. Again, methyl donor supplementation upregulated fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1), thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) and catalase (CAT) expression in the liver of MD-LPD fed mice compared to LPD mice. Altogether, our study revealed that odd chain fatty acids (OCFA)s are key early markers observed in a suboptimal diet-induced metabolic changes and may be potential targets to improve metabolic health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can adapt in response to numerous stress conditions. One such stress condition is zinc depletion. The zinc-sensing transcription factor Zur regulates the way enteric bacteria respond to severe changes in zinc availability. Under zinc sufficient conditions, Zn-loaded Zur (Zn2-Zur) is well-known to repress transcription of genes encoding zinc uptake transporters and paralogues of a few ribosomal subunits. Here, we report the discovery and mechanistic basis for the ability of Zur to up-regulate expression of the ribosomal protein L31 in response to zinc in E. coli. Through genetic mutations and reporter gene assays, we find that Zur achieves the up-regulation of L31 through a double repression cascade by which Zur first represses the transcription of L31p, a zinc-lacking paralogue of L31, which in turn represses the translation of L31. Mutational analyses show that translational repression by L31p requires an RNA hairpin structure within the l31 mRNA and involves the N-terminus of the L31p protein. This work uncovers a new genetic network that allows bacteria to respond to host-induced nutrient limiting conditions through a sophisticated ribosomal protein switching mechanism.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/493739v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6a6281org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6942f7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab7ce8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@957d55_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Time-resolved phylogenetic trees reveal that DFT1 first emerged in 1986 (1982-1989), and DFT2 in 2011 (2009-2012). Subclone analysis documents transmission of heterogeneous cell populations. DFT2 has faster mutation rates than DFT1 across all variant classes, including substitutions, indels, rearrangements, transposable element insertions and copy number alterations, and we identify a hypermutated DFT1 lineage with defective DNA mismatch repair. Several loci show plausible evidence of positive selection in DFT1 or DFT2, including loss of chromosome Y and inactivation of MGA, but none are common to both cancers.

    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway is required for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICL). ICLs are caused by genotoxins, such as chemotherapeutic agents or reactive aldehydes. Inappropriately repaired ICLs contribute to hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) failure and tumorigenesis. While endogenous acetaldehyde and formaldehyde are known to induce HSC failure and leukemia in humans with FA, the effects of other toxic metabolites in FA pathogenesis have not been systematically investigated. Using a metabolism-focused CRISPR screen, we found that ALDH9A1 deficiency causes synthetic lethality in FA pathway-deficient cells. Combined deficiency of ALDH9A1 and FANCD2 causes genomic instability, apoptosis, and decreased hematopoietic colony formation. Fanca-/-Aldh9a1-/- mice exhibited an increased incidence of ovarian tumors. A suppressor CRISPR screen revealed that the loss of ATP13A3, a polyamine transporter, resulted in improved survival of FANCD2-/-ALDH9A1-/- cells. These findings implicate high intracellular polyamines and the resulting 3-aminopropanal or acrolein in the pathogenesis of FA. In addition, we find that ALDH9A1 variants may be modifying disease onset in FA patients.\n\nStatement of SignificanceALDH9A1 deficiency is a previously unrecognized source of endogenous DNA damage. If not repaired by the Fanconi anemia pathway, such damage leads to increased genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Limiting substrates that accumulate when ALDH9A1 is absent can reduce aldehyde production and rescue synthetic lethality in the combined deficiency of ALDH9A1/FANCD2.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has demonstrated clinical success in \"inflamed\" tumors with significant T-cell infiltrates, but tumors with an immune-desert tumor microenvironment (TME) fail to benefit. The tumor cell-intrinsic molecular mechanisms of the immune-desert phenotype remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that inactivation of the Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) core components, EED or SUZ12, a prevalent genetic event in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) and sporadically in other cancer types, drives a context-dependent immune-desert TME. PRC2 inactivation reprograms the chromatin landscape that leads to a cell-autonomous shift from primed baseline signaling-dependent cellular responses (e.g., interferon {gamma}) to PRC2-regulated development and cellular differentiation transcriptional programs. Further, PRC2 inactivation reprograms the TME, leads to diminished tumor immune infiltrates and immune evasion through reduced chemokine production and impaired antigen presentation and T-cell priming, and confers ICB primary resistance through blunted T-cell recruitment in vivo. We demonstrate that strategies that enhancing innate immunity via intratumoral delivery of inactivated modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) leads to increased tumor immune infiltrates and sensitizes PRC2-loss tumors to ICB. Our results provide novel molecular mechanisms of context-dependent dysfunctional epigenetic reprogramming that underline the immune-desert phenotype in MPNST and other cancers with PRC2 inactivation. Importantly, our findings highlight genetic-inactivation of PRC2 as a novel context-dependent ICB therapeutic resistance biomarker in cancer, and caution that therapeutic strategies that non-selectively target PRC2 in the host may lead to undesirable context-dependent immune evasion and ICB resistance in tumors. Our studies also point to intratumoral delivery of immunogenic therapeutic viruses as an initial strategy to modulate the immune-desert TME and capitalize on the clinical benefit of ICB.",
