    "abstract": "Multidrug resistance-associated proteins are ABC C-family exporters. They are crucial in pharmacology as they transport various substrates across membranes. However, the role of the degenerate nucleotide-binding site (NBS) remains unclear likewise the interplay with the surrounding lipid environment. Here, we propose a dynamic and structural overview of MRP1 from ca. 110 {micro}s molecular dynamics simulations. ATP binding to NBS1 is likely maintained along several transport cycles. Asymmetric NBD behaviour is ensured by lower signal transduction from NBD1 to the rest of the protein owing to the absence of ball-and-socket conformation between NBD1 and coupling helices. Even though surrounding lipids play an active role in the allosteric communication between the substrate-binding pocket and NBDs, our results suggest that lipid composition has a limited impact, mostly by affecting transport kinetics. We believe that our work can be extended to other degenerate NBS ABC proteins and provide hints for deciphering mechanistic differences among ABC transporters.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetics is a technique for establishing direct spatiotemporal control over molecular function within living cells using light. Light application induces conformational changes within targeted proteins that produce changes in function. One of the applications of optogenetic tools is an allosteric control of proteins via light-sensitive LOV2 domain, which allows direct and robust control of protein function. Computational studies supported by cellular imaging demonstrated that application of light allosterically controlled signaling proteins Vav2, ITSN, and Rac1, but the structural and dynamic basis of such control has yet to be elucidated by experiment. Here, using NMR spectroscopy, we discover principles of action of allosteric control of cell division control protein 42 (CDC42), a small GTPase involved in cell signaling. Both LOV2 and Cdc42 employ flexibility in their function to switch between \"dark\"/ \"lit\" or active/inactive states, respectively. By conjoining Cdc42 and LOV2 domains into the bi-switchable fusion Cdc42Lov, application of light - or alternatively, mutation in LOV2 to mimic light absorption - allosterically inhibits Cdc42 downstream signaling. The flow and patterning of allosteric transduction in this flexible system is well-suited to observation by NMR. Close monitoring of the structural and dynamic properties of dark versus lit states of Cdc42Lov revealed lit-induced allosteric perturbations. Chemical shift perturbations for lit mimic, I539E, have distinct regions of sensitivity and both the domains are coupled together leading to bi-directional interdomain signaling. Insights gained from this optoallosteric design will increase our ability to control response sensitivity in future designs.\n\nSignificance StatementControl of cell signaling activity in proteins by light is one of the primary goals of optogenetics. The hybrid light-receptor/cell-signaling protein Cdc42Lov was engineered recently as an optogenetic tool, employing a novel allosteric strategy that results in photoinhibition. In contrast to previous activation designs, the mechanism of inhibition of GTPase signaling activity in Cdc42 is only apparent at a detailed structural and dynamic level. NMR characterization of dark and mutationally \"lit\" forms reveals the allosteric interdomain perturbations, knowledge of which will enhance future applications of this design strategy.",

    "abstract": "To disperse in water-unsaturated environments, such as the soil, bacteria rely on the availability and structure of water films forming on biotic and abiotic surfaces, and, especially, along fungal mycelia. Dispersal along such \"fungal highways\" is driven both by mycelial physical properties and by interactions between bacteria and fungi. To understand the role of abiotic elements, we designed and 3D-printed two devices establishing stable liquid films that support bacteria dispersal in the absence of biotic interactions. The thickness of the liquid film determined the presence of hydraulic flow capable of carrying non-motile cells. In the absence of flow, only motile cells can disperse in the presence of an energy source. Non-motile cells could not disperse autonomously without flow, but dispersed when co-inoculated with motile cells. By teasing apart the abiotic and biotic dimensions, these 3D-printed devices will stimulate further research on microbial dispersal in soil and other water-unsaturated environments.",

    "abstract": "Sterol lipids are required by most eukaryotes and are readily preserved as sterane molecular fossils. These geologic steranes are broadly interpreted as biomarkers for ancient eukaryotes1,2 although diverse bacteria also produce sterols3. Steranes with side-chain methylations can act as more specific biomarkers4 if their sterol precursors are limited to particular extant eukaryotes and are absent in bacteria. An abundance of one such sterane, 24-isopropylcholestane, in late Neoproterozoic rocks has been attributed to marine demosponges and potentially represents the earliest evidence for animals on Earth5. However, debates over this interpretation6-14 continue given the potential for alternative sources of 24-isopropylcholestane and the lack of experimental evidence demonstrating the function of enzymes that methylate sterols to give the 24-isopropyl side-chain. Here we show that sterol methyltransferases from both sponges and bacteria are functional and identify three bacterial methyltransferases each capable of sequential methylations resulting in the 24-isopropyl sterol side-chain. We identified two of these propylating enzymes in a demosponge metagenome suggesting bacterial symbionts contribute to 24-isopropyl sterol biosynthesis in demosponges. Our results demonstrate yet-uncultured bacteria have the genomic capacity to synthesize side-chain alkylated sterols and should therefore be considered when interpreting side-chain alkylated sterane biomarkers in the rock record.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorothioation (PT), in which a non-bridging oxygen is replaced by a sulfur, is one of the rare modifications discovered in bacteria and archaea that occurs on the sugar-phosphate backbone as opposed to the nucleobase moiety of DNA. While PT modification is widespread in the prokaryotic kingdom, how PT modifications are distributed in the genomes and their exact roles in the cell remain to be defined. In this study, we developed a simple and convenient technique called EcoWI-seq based on a modification-dependent restriction endonuclease to identify genomic positions of PT modifications. EcoWI-seq shows similar performance than other PT modification detection techniques and additionally, is easily scalable while requiring little starting material. As a proof of principle, we applied EcoWI-seq to map at base resolution the PT modifications in the genomes of both the Salmonella enterica cerro 87 and E. coli expressing the dnd+ gene cluster. Specifically, we address whether the partial establishment of modified PT positions is a stochastic or deterministic process. EcoWI-seq reveals a systematic usage of the same subset of target sites in clones for which the PT modification has been independently established.",

To investigate the differences of the gut microbiome between adult AD patients and healthy individuals, stool samples of 234 adults, containing 104 AD patients and 130 healthy subjects were collected for amplicon sequencing. Altered structure and metabolic dysfunctions of the gut microbiome were identified in adult AD patients. Our results illustrated that the adult AD patients were more likely to have allergies, particularly non-food allergies. And the gut microbiome composition of the AD and normal groups were considerably different. Besides, Romboutsia and Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1 was enriched in the normal group, whereas Blautia, Butyricicoccus, Lachnoclostridium, Eubacterium_hallii_group, Erysipelatoclostridium, Megasphaera, Oscillibacter, Flavonifractor were dominated in the AD group. Moreover, purine nucleotide degradation pathways were significantly enriched in the AD group and the enrichment of proteinogenic amino acid biosynthesis pathways was found in the normal group. This study provides insights into new therapeutic strategies targeting the gut microbiome for AD and evidence for the involvement of gut-skin axis in AD patients.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) enterobacteria remains challenging due to the limited therapeutic options. Drug repurposing could accelerate the development of urgently needed successful interventions. This work aimed to identify and characterize novel drug combinations against Klebsiella pneumoniae based on the concepts of synergy and drug repurposing. We performed a semi-qualitative high-throughput synergy screening (sHTSS) with tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin (last-line antibiotics against MDR Enterobacteriaceae) combined with an FDA-library containing 1,430 clinically approved drugs. Selected hits were further validated by secondary checkerboard (CBA) and time-kill (TKA) assays. Our sHTSS results yielded 37, 31 and 41 hits showing synergy with tigecycline, colistin and fosfomycin, respectively. Most hits (75%) were known antibiotics. Non-antibiotic compounds included other anti-infective agents (7%), antineoplastics (7%) or antipsychotics (3%). Overall, 15.09% and 65.85% of hits were further confirmed by CBA and TKA, respectively, indicating that TKA is more useful than CBA for the validation of synergistic combinations. Accordingly, TKA were used for synergy classification based on determination of the bactericidal activities at 8, 24 and 48 hours. Twenty-seven combinations were validated with effective synergistic activity against K. pneumoniae by TKA, six of them novel non-antibiotic combinations. Based on our observations we conclude that repurposing approaches allowed to enhance the activity of last-line antibiotics in the treatment of MDR K. pneumoniae. sHTSS paired to TKA was a powerful tool for the identification of novel synergistic drug combinations against K. pneumoniae. Further pre-clinical studies might support the translational potential of these novel combinations.",

    "abstract": "Dramatically increased levels of electromagnetic radiation in the environment have raised concerns over the potential health hazards of electromagnetic fields. Various biological effects of magnetic fields have been proposed. Despite decades of intensive research, the molecular mechanisms procuring cellular responses remain largely unknown. The current literature is conflicting with regards to evidence that magnetic fields affect functionality directly at cellular level. Therefore, a search for potential direct cellular effects of magnetic fields represents a cornerstone that may propose an explanation for potential health hazards associated with magnetic fields. Recently, it was postulated that autofluorescence of HeLa cells is magnetic field sensitive, relying on single-cell imaging kinetic measurements. Here, we explore the utility of this approach by undertaking a screen for magnetic sensitivity of cellular autofluorescence in statistically relevant numbers (90-107) of HeLa cells. We did not observe any changes in cellular autofluorescence decay, when a modulated magnetic field was applied. We present a number of arguments indicating weak points in the analysis of magnetic field effects based on the imaging of cellular autofluorescence decay. Our work indicates that new methods are required to elucidate the effects of magnetic fields at the cellular level.",

    "abstract": "The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe have served as invaluable model organisms to study various fundamental and highly conserved cellular processes. While super-resolution (SR) microscopy has in recent years paved the way to a better understanding of the spatial organization of molecules in cells, its wide use in yeast models has remained limited due to the specific know-how and specialized instrumentation required, contrasted with the relative ease of endogenous tagging and live cell fluorescence microscopy in these systems. To facilitate SR microscopy in yeasts, we have extended the ultrastructure expansion microscopy (U-ExM) method to both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, enabling 4-fold isotropic expansion in both systems. We demonstrate here that U-ExM allows the nanoscale imaging of the microtubule cytoskeleton and its associated spindle pole body (SPB), notably unveiling a conserved Sfi1p/Cdc31p spatial organization on the appendage bridge structure. In S. pombe, we validate the method by quantifying the homeostatic regulation of nuclear pore complex (NPC) number through the cell cycle. Combined with pan-labelling (NHS ester), which provides a global cellular context, U-ExM unveils the subcellular organization of the eukaryote yeast models S. cerevisiae and S. pombe. This easy-to-implement imaging with conventional microscopes provides nanoscale resolution and adds a powerful new method to the already extensive yeast toolbox.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDNA methylation (DNAm) based age clocks have been studied extensively as a biomarker of human ageing and risk factor for age-related diseases. Despite different tissues having vastly different rates of proliferation, it is still largely unknown whether they age at different rates. It was previously reported that the cerebellum ages slowly, however, this claim was drawn from a single clock using a small sample size and so warrants further investigation.\n\nResultsWe collected the largest cerebellum DNAm dataset (N=752). We found the respective epigenetic ages are all severely underestimated by six representative DNAm age clocks, with the underestimation effects more pronounced in the four clocks whose training datasets do not include brain-related tissues. We identified 613 age-associated CpGs in the cerebellum, which accounts for only 14.5% of the number found in the middle temporal gyrus from the same population (N=404), of which only 201 CpGs are both age-associated in the two tissue types. We built a highly accurate age prediction model for the cerebellum named CerebellumClockspecific (Pearson correlation=0.941, MAD=3.18 years). Furthermore, based on the 201 age-associated CpGs, we built two other clocks CerebellumClockcommon and CortexClockcommon for the cerebellum and non-cerebellar brain cortex tissues separately, they both support that the cerebellum has a relative lower DNAm ageing rate.\n\nConclusionsThe large underestimation for the cerebellum by previous clocks mainly reflects the improper usage of the age clocks. There exist strong and consistent ageing effects on the cerebellar methylome despite the cerebellum having unique age-dependent methylome changes. The DNAm clock based ageing rates comparisons are valid only upon models constructed on a small group of CpGs, therefore, more evidence is required to support the idea that different DNAm ageing rates represent different biological ageing rates.",

    "abstract": "SummaryThe rapid advancement of new genomic sequencing technology has enabled the development of multi-omic single-cell sequencing assays. These assays profile multiple modalities in the same cell and can often yield new insights not revealed with a single modality. For example, CITE-Seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing) simultaneously profiles the single-cell RNA transcriptome and the surface protein expression. The extra dimension of surface protein markers can be used to further identify cell clusters - an essential step for downstream analyses and interpretation. Additionally, multi-dimensional datasets like CITE-Seq require nuanced visualization methods to accurately assess the data. To facilitate cell cluster classification and visualization in CITE-Seq, we developed CITE-Viz. CITE-Viz is a single-cell visualization platform with a custom module that replicates the interactive flow-cytometry gating workflow. With CITE-Viz, users can investigate CITE-Seq specific quality control (QC) metrics, view multi-omic co-expression feature plots, and classify cell clusters by iteratively gating on the abundance of cell surface markers. CITE-Viz was developed to make multi-modal single-cell analysis accessible to a wide variety of biologists, with the aim to discover new insights into their data and to facilitate novel hypothesis generation.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationCITE-Viz installation and usage instructions can be found in the GitHub repository https://github.com/maxsonBraunLab/CITE-Viz\n\nContactmaxsonj@ohsu.edu\n\nSupplementary InformationDown-sampled peripheral blood mononuclear dataset (Hao et al. 2021): https://bit.ly/3vxbhfW",

    "abstract": "Painful peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurological complication associated with human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection. Currently available treatments fail to provide adequate symptom relief, indicating the need for novel treatment strategies. To address this gap in knowledge, we characterized the impact of cannabinoid CB2 agonists, which lack psychoactivity associated with central CB1 activation, on antiretroviral-induced neuropathic nociception and identified cell types expressing CB2 that mediate the antinociceptive efficacy of CB2 agonists. Two structurally distinct CB2 agonists (AM1710 and LY2828360) alleviated antiretroviral-induced neuropathic pain, benefits which were absent in CB2 knockout mice. Conditional deletion of CB2 from peripheral sensory neurons eliminated the antinociceptive efficacy of CB2 agonists. We also asked whether LY2828360 treatment could reverse established morphine tolerance in the ddC-induced neuropathy model and whether CB2 expression on peripheral sensory neurons is necessary for sparing of morphine tolerance by LY2828360. The present studies suggest that CB2 activation may alleviate HIV-associated antiretroviral neuropathy and identify a previously unreported mechanism through which CB2 activation produces antinociceptive efficacy. Our results also provide the first evidence that a CB2 agonist can reverse established morphine tolerance and demonstrate that CB2 localized to peripheral sensory neurons mediates the opioid tolerance sparing efficacy of CB2 agonists.",

    "abstract": "Neuromodulation interventions, such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), are proposed as possible new complementary therapies to treat substance use disorders (SUD) such as alcohol use disorder (AUD). It is hypothesized that neuromodulation may induce neural plasticity in the reward and frontostriatal systems via electrical field induction, possibly reducing symptoms. Preclinical self-administration rodent models of AUD may help us gain insight into the effects of neuromodulation therapies on different pathology, as well as the neural mechanisms behind the positive effects. DBS, or any type of brain stimulation using intracranial electrodes in rodents, would benefit from the use of MRI to study the longitudinal effects and mechanisms of stimulation as well as novel targets, as it is a non-invasive technique that allows the analysis of structural and functional changes in the brain. To do this, there is a need for MRI-compatible electrodes that allow for MRI acquisition with minimal distortion of the magnetic field. In this protocol, we present a method for the construction and surgery of chronically implantable monopolar carbon electrodes for use in rats. Unlike conventional electrodes, carbon electrodes are resistant to high temperatures, flexible, and generate fewer artifacts in MRI compared to conventional ones. We validated its use by using a focal electrical stimulation high-frequency (20 Hz) protocol that lasted ~10 sessions. We propose that this technique can also be used for the research of the neurophysiological bases of the neuromodulatory treatment in other preclinical substance use disorders (SUD) models.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a memory related neurodegenerative disorder mainly associated with older adults. In this study, transgenic Drosophila AD model has been employed to investigate the tau associated proteome. Tau expression was specifically induced in the eye tissues and diseased fly heads were considered for proteomic studies with appropriate controls. We have identified 6 novel proteins from tau induced AD group by 2D and PD Quest analyses and further characterized them by in-vivo and in-silico approaches. The novel Tau interactors, [Obp44a Isoform A, Pglym Isoform A, IP15846p (Adh variant), RE45450p (mRpL2), Retinin, and Glob1 Isoform B], identified by MALDI-TOF/MS were validated through q-RT-PCR. The altered metabolic, behavioral and mitochondrial dynamics associated with Tau over expressing AD flies could be due to the altered expression of Odorant binding protein 44a (Obp44a) and mitochondrial ribosomal protein L2 (mRpL2), respectively. Further, we have showed for the first time the newly identified protein interaction with tau and other regulatory proteins through protein-protein docking, biocomputational classification and evolutionary relationship using in silico studies. Moreover, the study highlights the plausible role of these novel proteins in pathophysiology of phospho-tau induced AD flies and further help unraveling molecular pathways implicated in tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "The ability to process and act upon incoming sounds during locomotion is critical for survival. Intriguingly, sound responses of auditory cortical neurons are on average weaker during locomotion as compared to immobility and these results have been suggested to reflect a computational resource allocation shift from auditory to visual processing. However, the evolutionary benefit of this hypothesis remains unclear. In particular, whether weaker sound-evoked responses during locomotion indeed reflect a reduced involvement of the auditory cortex, or whether they result from an alternative neural computation in this state remains unresolved. To address this question, we first used neural inactivation in behaving mice and found that the auditory cortex plays a critical role in sound-guided behavior during locomotion. To investigate the nature of this processing, we used two-photon calcium imaging of local excitatory auditory cortical neural populations in awake mice. We found that underlying a net inhibitory effect of locomotion on sound-evoked response magnitude, spatially intermingled neuronal subpopulations were differentially influenced by locomotion. Further, the net inhibitory effect of locomotion on sound-evoked responses was strongly shaped by elevated ongoing activity. Importantly, rather than reflecting enhanced \"noise\", this ongoing activity reliably encoded the animals locomotion speed. Prediction analyses revealed that sound, locomotive state and their integration are strongly encoded by auditory cortical ensemble activity. Finally, we found consistent patterns of locomotion-sound integration in electrophysiologically recorded activity in freely moving rats. Together, our data suggest that auditory cortical ensembles are not simply suppressed by locomotion but rather encode it alongside sound information to support sound perception during locomotion.",

    "abstract": "Most contemporary theories of sensorimotor decision-making formalize the process leading up to a decision as a gradual accumulation of noisy stimulus information over time. The resulting evidence signal is thought to be continuously tested against an internal criterion representing the amount of evidence required to make the decision. In the currently prevailing view, the amount of accumulated evidence required for a decision is independent of the amount of sensory evidence presented by the stimulus, and once that level is reached, a choice is categorically communicated to the motor system to execute an overt response. Recent experimental research casts doubts on both of these assumptions. Using a Leaky Integrating Threshold model, we relax these assumptions specifying both an evidence accumulation and a motor accumulation process. The evidence accumulation signal feeds into a leaky motor accumulator, and it is on the level of the motor accumulation that the final decision criterion is set. This adaptation results in a markedly better description of choice-RT data, especially when it comes to urgency manipulations. We show that this alternative theory, which proposes that sensory evidence is doubly integrated before final evaluation, does not only describe the behavioral data better, but its neural correlates can also be readily derived from EEG signatures involving systems of both evidence and motor accumulation.",

Neuronal injury and cell death are prominent pathological features, however the role of Gba in individual cell types and involvement of microglia, blood derived macrophages and immune infiltrates in nGD pathology remains enigmatic.\n\nMethodsHere, using single cell resolution of mouse nGD brains, we found induction of neuroinflammation pathways involving microglia, NK cells, astrocytes, and neurons.\n\nResultsTargeted rescue of Gba in microglia and in neurons, respectively in Gba deficient, nGD mice reversed the buildup of glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and glucosylsphingosine (GlcSph), concomitant with amelioration of neuroinflammation, reduced level of serum neurofilament light chain (Nf-L) and improved survival. The levels of bioactive lipid, GlcSph was strongly correlated with serum Nf-L and ApoE in nGD mouse models as well as GD patients. Gba rescue in microglia/macrophage compartment prolonged survival, that was further enhanced upon treatment with brain permeant inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, effects mediated via improved glycosphingolipid homeostasis and reversal of neuroinflammation involving activation of microglia, brain macrophages and NK cells.\n\nConclusionsTogether, our study delineates individual cellular effects of Gba deficiency in nGD brains, highlighting the central role of neuroinflammation driven by microglia activation and the role of brain permeant small molecule glucosylceramide inhibitor in reversing complex multidimensional pathophysiology of nGD.

Using novel genetic tools, we characterized the transcriptional programs of distinct colonic effector Treg cell types. We found that attenuated T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and acquisition of substantial TCR independent functionality appears to facilitate the terminal differentiation of a population of colonic effector Treg cells distinguished by stable expression of immunomodulatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Functional studies revealed that this subset of effector Treg cells, but not their expression of IL-10, was indispensable for colonic health.

    "abstract": "Cartilaginous fishes have various unique physiological features such as cartilaginous skeletons and a urea-based osmoregulation strategy for adaptation to their marine environment. Also, because they are considered a sister group of bony vertebrates, understanding their unique features is important from an evolutionary perspective. However, experimental approaches are limited in cartilaginous fishes. Particularly, genetic engineering, which can analyze gene functions as well as cellular behavior, has not been effectively utilized in cartilaginous fishes. This is partly because their reproductive strategy involves internal fertilization, which results in difficulty in microinjection into fertilized eggs at the early developmental stage. Trials of gene transfer have also been limited both in in vitro cultured cells and in vivo. Here, to identify efficient gene transfer methods in cartilaginous fishes, we examined the effects of various methods both in vitro and in vivo using the cloudy catshark, a candidate model cartilaginous fish species. In all methods, green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression was used to evaluate exogenous gene introduction. First, we established a primary cell culture containing fibroblast-like and epithelial-like cells from cloudy catshark embryos. Using these primary cultured cells, we attempted gene transfection by lipofection, polyethylenimine (PEI), adenovirus, baculovirus and electroporation. Among the methods tested, lipofection, electroporation and baculovirus infection enabled the successful introduction of exogenous genes into primary cultured cells, allowing us to study physiological mechanisms at a single-cell level in culture conditions close to those in a living cartilaginous fish. We also attempted in vivo transfection into cloudy catshark embryos by electroporation and baculovirus infection. Although baculovirus-injected groups did not show GFP fluorescence, electroporation successfully introduced GFP into various tissues including muscle cells. Furthermore, we succeeded in GFP introduction into adult testis by electroporation. The in vitro and in vivo gene introduction methods that worked in this study may identify paths for future genetic manipulation including knockout experiments and cellular linage analysis in cartilaginous fishes.",

We use these PGL-3 constructs to show that introducing other P granule components buffers against large change of dynamics within liquid-like compartments.

    "abstract": "Nucleobase-containing coenzymes are considered the relics of an early RNA-based world that preceded the emergence of protein domains. Despite the importance of coenzyme-protein synergisms, their emergence and evolution remain poorly understood. An excellent target to address this issue is the Rossman fold, the most catalytically diverse and abundant protein architecture in Nature. Here, we investigatedted the two largest Rossman lineages, namely the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P))-binding and the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent superfamilies. With the aim to identify the evolutionary changes that lead to a switch in coenzyme specificity on these superfamilies, we performed structural and sequence-based Hidden Markov Models to systematically search for key motifs in their coenzyme-binding pockets. Our analyses revealed how insertions and deletions (InDels) reshaped the ancient {beta}1-loop-1 coenzyme-binding structure of NAD(P) into the well-defined SAM-binding {beta}1-loop-1 structure. To prove this observation experimentally, we removed an InDel of three amino acids from the NAD(P) coenzyme pocket and solved the structure of the resulting mutant, revealing the characteristic features of the SAM-binding pocket. To confirm the binding to SAM, we performed isothermal titration calorimetry measurements, validating the successful coenzyme switch. Molecular dynamics simulations also corroborated the role of InDels in abolishing NAD-binding and acquiring SAM binding. Our results uncovered how Nature utilized insertions and deletions to switch coenzyme specificity, and in turn, functionalities between these superfamilies. This work also establishes how protein structures could have been recycled through the course of evolution to adopt different coenzymes and confer different chemistries.\n\nSignificance StatementCofactors are ubiquitous molecules necessary to drive about half of the enzymatic reactions in Nature. Among them, organic cofactors (coenzymes) that contain nucleotide moieties are believed to be relics of a hypothetical RNA world. Understanding coenzyme-binding transitions sheds light onto the emergence of the first enzymes and their chemical diversity. Rossmann enzymes bind to 7 out of 10 nucleotide coenzymes, representing an ideal target to study how different coenzyme specificities emerged and evolved. Here we demonstrated how insertions and deletions reshape coenzyme-specificity in Rossmann enzymes by retracing the emergence of the SAM-binding function from an NAD-binding ancestor.

    "abstract": "Midichloria are intracellular bacterial symbionts of ticks. Some representatives of this genus have the unique capability to colonize mitochondria in the cells of their hosts. Hypotheses on the nature of this interaction have proven difficult to test, partly due to a lack of data. Indeed, until now, mitochondrial tropism information and genomes were available only for symbionts of three and two tick host species, respectively. Here we analyzed the mitochondrial tropism of three additional Midichloria and sequenced nine novel genomes, showing that the tropism is pnon-monophyletic, either due to losses of the trait or multiple parallel acquisitions. Comparative genome analyses support the first hypothesis, as the genomes of non-mitochondrial symbionts appear to be reduced subsets of those capable of colonizing the organelles. We detect genomic signatures of mitochondrial tropism, showing a set of candidate genes characteristic of the strains capable of mitochondrial colonization. These include the type IV secretion system and the flagellum, which could allow the secretion of unique effectors, direct interaction with, or invasion of the mitochondria. Other genes, including putative adhesion molecules, proteins possibly involved in actin polymerization, cell wall and outer membrane proteins, are only present in mitochondrial symbionts. The bacteria could use these to manipulate host structures, including mitochondrial membranes, in order to fuse with the organelles or manipulate the mitochondrial network.",

Pc-bound chromatin regions form repressive domains that interact in 3D to assemble repressive nuclear compartments. Here, we used multiplexed chromatin imaging to investigate whether Pc compartments involve the clustering of multiple Pc domains during Drosophila development. Notably, 3D proximity between Pc targets is rare and involves predominantly pairwise interactions. These 3D proximities are particularly enhanced in segments where Pc genes are co-repressed. In addition, segment-specific expression of Hox Pc targets leads to their spatial segregation from Pc repressed genes. Finally, non-Hox Pc targets are proximal in regions where they are co-expressed. These results indicate that long-range Pc interactions are temporally and spatially regulated during differentiation and development but do not involve clustering of multiple distant Pc genes.",

Understanding the effect of current and future climates on crop agrobiodiversity may guide breeding efforts and adaptation strategies to sustain the livelihoods of farmers cropping in challenging conditions. Here, we combine a genomic and climatic characterization of a large collection of traditional barley varieties from Ethiopia, key to food security in local smallholder farming systems. We employ data-driven approaches to characterize their local adaptation to current and future climates and identify barley genomic regions with potential for breeding for local adaptation. We used a sequencing approach to genotype at high- density 436 barley varieties, finding that their genetic diversity can be traced back to geography and environmental diversity in Ethiopia. We integrate this information in a genome-wide association study targeting phenology traits measured in common garden experiments as well as climatic features at sampling points of traditional varieties, describing 106 genomic loci associated with local adaptation. We then employ a machine learning approach to link barley genomic diversity with climate variation, estimating barley genomic offset in future climate scenarios. Our data show that the genomic characterization of traditional agrobiodiversity coupled with climate modelling may contribute to the mitigation of the climate crisis effects on smallholder farming systems.",

The Erfurt individuals are genetically similar to modern AJ and have substantial Southern European ancestry, but they show more variability in Eastern European-related ancestry than modern AJ. A third of the Erfurt individuals carried the same nearly-AJ-specific mitochondrial haplogroup and eight carried pathogenic variants known to affect AJ today. These observations, together with high levels of runs of homozygosity, suggest that the Erfurt community had already experienced the major reduction in size that affected modern AJ. However, the Erfurt bottleneck was more severe, implying substructure in medieval AJ. Together, our results suggest that the AJ founder event and the acquisition of the main sources of ancestry pre-dated the 14th century and highlight late medieval genetic heterogeneity no longer present in modern AJ.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobial species often harbor substantial functional diversity driven by structural genetic variation. Rapid adaptation from such standing variation in pathogens threatens global food security and human health. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful approach to identify genetic variants underlying recent pathogen evolution. However, the reliance on single reference genomes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) obscures the true extent of adaptive genetic variation. Here, we show quantitatively how a combination of multiple reference genomes and reference-free approaches captures substantially more relevant genetic variation compared to single reference mapping.\n\nResultsWe performed reference-genome based association mapping across 19 reference-quality genomes covering the diversity of the species. We contrasted the results with a reference-free (i.e., K-mer) approach using raw whole genome sequencing data. We assessed the relative power of these GWAS approaches in a panel of 145 strains collected across the global distribution range of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We mapped the genetic architecture of 49 life history traits including virulence, reproduction and growth in multiple stressful environments. The inclusion of additional reference genome SNP datasets provides a nearly linear increase in additional loci mapped through GWAS. Variants detected through the K-mer approach explained a higher proportion of phenotypic variation than a reference genome based approach, illustrating the benefits of including genetic variants beyond SNPs.\n\nConclusionsOur study demonstrates how the power of GWAS in microbial species can be significantly enhanced by comprehensively capturing functional genetic variation. Our approach is generalizable to a large number of microbial species and will uncover novel mechanisms driving rapid adaptation in microbial populations.",

Tumour cells are characterized by specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can be used as cancer biomarkers. Through olfactory associative learning, animals can be trained to detect these VOCs. Insects, such as ants, have a refined sense of smell and can be easily and rapidly trained with olfactory conditioning. Using urine from patient-derived xenograft mice as stimulus, we demonstrate that individual ants can learn to discriminate the odour of healthy mice from that of tumour bearing mice, and do so after only three conditioning trials. Chemical analyses confirmed that the presence of the tumour changed the urine odour, supporting the behavioural results.

Since the robustness of existing signatures is controversial, we performed a systematic evaluation of three established signatures for PDAC stratification across eight publicly available datasets. Clustering revealed inconsistency of subtypes across independent datasets and in some cases a different number of PDAC subgroups than in the original study, casting doubt on the actual number of existing subtypes. Next, we built nine classification models to investigate the ability of the signatures for tumor subtype prediction. The overall classification performance ranged from [~]35% to [~]90% accuracy, suggesting instability of the signatures. Notably, permuted subtypes and random gene sets achieved very similar performance. Cellular decomposition and functional pathway enrichment analysis revealed strong tissue-specificity of the predicted classes. Our study highlights severe limitations and inconsistencies that can be attributed to technical biases in sample preparation and tumor purity, suggesting that PDAC molecular signatures do not generalize across datasets. How stromal heterogeneity and immune compartment interplay in the diverging development of PDAC is still unclear. Therefore, a more mechanistic or at least multi-omic approach seems necessary to extract more robust and clinically exploitable insights.",

Anatomy-based TNM staging does not exactly identify treatment-sensitive patients, and an ideal biomarker is urgently needed for precision medicine.\n\nMethodsA total of 1280 patients from 10 multi-center cohorts were enrolled. 10 machine-learning algorithms were transformed into 76 combinations, which were performed to construct an artificial intelligence-derived prognostic signature (AIDPS). The predictive performance, multi-omic alterations, immune landscape, and clinical significance of AIDPS were further explored.\n\nResultsBased on 10 independent cohorts, we screened 32 consensus prognostic genes via univariate Cox regression. According to the criterion with the largest average C-index in the nine validation sets, we selected the optimal algorithm to construct the AIDPS. After incorporating several vital clinicopathological features and 86 published signatures, AIDPS exhibited robust and dramatically superior predictive capability. Moreover, in other prevalent digestive system tumors, the 9-gene AIDPS could still accurately stratify the prognosis. Of note, our AIDPS had important clinical implications for PACA, and patients with low AIDPS owned a dismal prognosis, relatively high frequency of mutations and copy number alterations, and denser immune cell infiltrates as well as were more sensitive to immunotherapy. Correspondingly, the high AIDPS group possessed dramatically prolonged survival, and panobinostat might be a potential agent for patients with high AIDPS.\n\nConclusionsThe AIDPS could accurately predict the prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy of PACA, which might become an attractive tool to further guide the stratified management and individualized treatment.\n\nFundingThis study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81870457, 82172944).",

Previous studies that investigated the lower extremity movements such as jumping and sprinting demonstrated enhancement of the maximum force and rate of force development immediately after the plyometric exercises. However, it remains unknown whether the plyometric exercises enhance the stability of timing and force production of the dexterous finger movements in trained individuals. Here we address this issue by examining the effects of plyometric-like training specialized for finger movements on piano performance by well-trained pianists. The training demonstrated a decrease of the variation in timing and velocity of successive keystrokes, along with a concomitant increase in the rate of force development of the four fingers, but not the thumb, although there was no change in the finger muscular activities through the training. By contrast, such a training effect was not evident following a conventional repetitive piano practice. In addition, a significant increase in the forearm muscle temperature was observed specifically through performing the plyometric exercise with the fingers, implying its association with improved performance. These results indicate effectiveness of the plyometric exercises for improvement of strength, precision, and physiological efficiency of the finger movements even in expert pianists, which implicates a role of ways of practicing in enhancing experts expertise.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of high-throughput genome sequencing, bioinformatics training has become essential for research in evolutionary biology and related fields. However, individual research groups are often not in the position to teach students about the most up-to-date methodology in the field. To fill this gap, extended bioinformatics courses have been developed by various institutions and provide intense training over the course of two or more weeks. Here, we describe our experience with the organization of a course in one of the longest-running extended bioinformatics series of work-shops, the Evomics Workshop on Population and Speciation Genomics that takes place biennially in the UNESCO world heritage town of [C]esky Krumlov, Czech Republic. We list the key ingredients that make this workshop successful in our view, and describe the routine for workshop organization that we have optimized over the years. We report the results of a survey conducted among past workshop participants that quantifies measures of effective teaching and provide examples of how the workshop setting has led to the cross-fertilisation of ideas and ultimately scientific progress. We expect that our account may be useful for other groups aiming to set up their own extended bioinformatics courses.",

    "abstract": "Landmark-based and self-motion-based navigation are two fundamental forms of spatial navigation, which involve distinct cognitive mechanisms. A critical question is whether these two navigation modes invoke common or distinct spatial representations for a given environment in the brain. While a number of electrophysiological studies in non-human animals have investigated this question but yielded inconsistent results, it still awaits rigorous investigation in humans. In the current study, we combined ultra-high field fMRI at 7T and desktop virtual reality with state-of-the-art fMRI data analysis techniques. Using a novel linear track navigation task, we dissociated the use of landmarks and self-motion cues, so that participants used different spatial cues to encode and retrieve the same set of spatial locations. Focusing on the retrosplenial cortex (RSC) and the hippocampus, we observed that RSC contained both cue-specific and cue-independent spatial representations, which were driven by objective location (where the participant was actually located) and subjective location (the participants self-reported location), respectively. The hippocampus showed strong functional coupling with RSC and exhibited a similar spatial coding scheme, but with reduced effect sizes. Taken together, the current study demonstrated for the first time concurrent cue-specific and cue-independent spatial representations in RSC in the same spatial context, suggesting that this area might transform cue-specific spatial inputs into coherent cue-independent spatial representations to guide navigation behavior.",

However, the physical constraints and costs of fMRI measurements prevent brain decoding from achieving real-world applications. To address this issue, this study aims to build a framework to decode individual differences in mental information under natural situations via brain-response prediction using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Once the CNN-based prediction model is constructed using measured brain response, no additional fMRI measurements are needed to decode mental information from the predicted responses of individual brains. As per our analysis, it was found that in 81 of 87 items to be decoded, this framework captured individual difference patterns consistent with conventional decoding using measured brain responses. Our framework has great potential to decode personal mental information with minimal fMRI measuring constraints or costs, which substantially expands the applicability of brain decoding in daily life.",

    "abstract": "During visual search for objects (e.g., an apple), the surrounding distractor objects may share perceptual (tennis ball), categorical (banana), or both (peach) properties with the target. Previous studies showed that the perceptual similarity between target and distractor objects influences visual search. Here, we tested whether categorical target-distractor similarity also influences visual search, and how this influence depends on perceptual similarity. By orthogonally manipulating categorical and perceptual target-distractor similarity, we could investigate how and when the two similarities interactively affect search performance and neural correlates of spatial attention (N2pc) using electroencephalography (EEG). Behavioral results showed that categorical target-distractor similarity interacted with perceptual target-distractor similarity, such that the effect of categorical similarity was strongest when target and distractor objects were perceptually similar. EEG results showed that perceptual similarity influenced the early part of the N2pc (200-250 ms after stimulus onset), while categorical similarity influenced the later part (250-300 ms). Mirroring the behavioral results, categorical similarity interacted with perceptual similarity during this later time window, with categorical effects only observed for perceptually similar target-distractor pairs. Together, these results provide evidence for hierarchical processing in visual search: categorical properties influence spatial attention only when perceptual properties are insufficient to guide attention to the target.\n\nPublic significance statementSearching for a target object among perceptually similar distractor objects (e.g., looking for an apple among peaches) is relatively difficult. In daily life, target and distractor objects may not only share perceptual but also non-perceptual properties, such as category membership (e.g., fruit). Here, we show that categorical similarity between target and distractor objects influences search performance, particularly when target and distractor objects are perceptually similar. Using electrophysiological recordings, we demonstrate that attentional selection is first influenced by perceptual and then by categorical information. This later categorical influence depended on perceptual similarity, being strongest for perceptually similar objects. These findings provide evidence for hierarchical processing in visual search, with categorical properties extracted after perceptual properties.",

A plethora of signaling pathways act in concert to mediate the precise spatial arrangement of synaptic connections. Here we show a novel role for a gap junction protein in controlling tiled synaptic arrangement in the GABAergic motor neurons in C. elegans, in which their axons and synapses overlap minimally with their neighboring neurons within the same class. We found that while EGL-20/Wnt controls axonal tiling, their presynaptic tiling is mediated by a gap junction protein UNC-9/Innexin, that is localized at the presynaptic tiling border between neighboring DD neurons. Strikingly, the gap junction channel activity of UNC-9 is dispensable for its function in controlling tiled presynaptic patterning. While gap junctions are crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system as channels, our finding uncovered the novel channel-independent role of UNC-9 in synapse patterning.",

    "abstract": "The central tendency bias, or contraction bias, is a phenomenon where the judgment of the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. It is assumed to be an optimal strategy by the brain, and commonly thought of as an expression of the brains ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. On the other hand, recency biases such as serial dependence are also commonly observed, and are thought to reflect the content of working memory. Recent results from an auditory delayed comparison task in rats, suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought: when the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was silenced, both short-term and contraction biases were reduced. By proposing a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating the behavior, we show that a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience - producing short-term sensory history biases - naturally leads to contraction bias. The errors, occurring at the level of individual trials, are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli, and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory towards the sensory distributions mean. Our results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. Finally, we validate our model by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task.",

    "abstract": "Several recent studies investigated the rhythmic nature of cognitive processes that lead to perception and behavioral report. These studies used different methods, and there has not yet been an agreement on a general standard. Here, we present a way to test and quantitatively compare these methods. We simulated behavioral data from a typical experiment and analyzed these data with several methods. We applied the main methods found in the literature, namely sine-wave fitting, the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the Least Square Spectrum (LSS). DFT and LSS can be applied both on the averaged accuracy time course and on single trials. LSS is mathematically equivalent to DFT in the case of regular, but not irregular sampling - which is more common. LSS additionally offers the possibility to take into account a weighting factor which affects the strength of the rhythm, such as arousal. Statistical inferences were done either on the investigated sample (fixed-effect) or on the population (random-effect) of simulated participants. Multiple comparisons across frequencies were corrected using False-Discovery-Rate, Bonferroni, or the Max-Based approach. To perform a quantitative comparison, we calculated Sensitivity, Specificity and D-prime of the investigated analysis methods and statistical approaches. Within the investigated parameter range, single-trial methods had higher sensitivity and D-prime than the methods based on the averaged-accuracy-time-course. This effect was further increased for a simulated rhythm of higher frequency. If an additional (observable) factor influenced detection performance, adding this factor as weight in the LSS further improved Sensitivity and D-prime. For multiple comparison correction, the Max-Based approach provided the highest Specificity and D-prime, closely followed by the Bonferroni approach. Given a fixed total amount of trials, the random-effect approach had higher D-prime when trials were distributed over a larger number of participants, even though this gave less trials per participant. Finally, we present the idea of using a dampened sinusoidal oscillator instead of a simple sinusoidal function, to further improve the fit to behavioral rhythmicity observed after a reset event.",

    "abstract": "Defects in nucleic acid metabolizing enzymes lead to spontaneous but selective activation of either cGAS/STING or RIG-like receptor (RLR) signaling, causing a pathogenic type I interferon response and inflammatory diseases. In these pathophysiological conditions, cGAS-driven IFN production is linked to spontaneous DNA damage. Physiological, or tonic, IFN signaling on the other hand is essential to functionally prime nucleic acid sensing pathways. Here we show that low-level chronic DNA damage in mice lacking the Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome gene SAMHD1 reduced tumor-free survival when crossed to a p53-deficient, but not to DNA mismatch repair-deficient background. Increased DNA damage did not result in higher levels of type I interferon. Instead, we found that the chronic interferon response in SAMHD1-deficient mice was driven by the MDA5/MAVS pathway but required functional priming through the cGAS/STING pathway. Our work positions cGAS/STING upstream of tonic IFN signaling and highlights an important role of the pathway in physiological and pathophysiological innate immune priming.\n\nSummaryLoss of the dNTPase and DNA repair enzyme SAMHD1 is associated with cancer and causes systemic autoimmunity.

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite the decades-old knowledge that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), the reasons for this association are only partially understood. Among the immune cells involved in CVD development, accumulating evidence supports the critical role of T cells as drivers and modifiers of this condition. CD4+ T cells are commonly found in atherosclerotic plaques. The activity and distribution of CD4+ T cell subsets differs between the sexes.\n\nMethodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 61 men and women who underwent cardiac catheterization were interrogated by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq, [~]200,000 cells) combined with 49 protein markers (CITE-Seq). Coronary artery disease (CAD) was quantified using Gensini scores, with scores above 30 considered CAD+ and below 6 considered CAD-. Four pairs of groups were matched for clinical and demographic parameters. To test how DM changed cell proportions and gene expression, we compared matched groups of diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. We analyzed 41,782 single CD4+ T cell transcriptomes for sex differences in 61 mostly statin-treated coronary artery disease patients with and without DM.\n\nResultsWe identified 16 clusters in CD4 T cells. The proportion of cells in CD4 cluster 8 (CD4T8, CCR2+ Em) was significantly decreased in CAD+, especially among DM+ participants. The proportions of cells in CD4T2, CD4T11, CD4T16 were increased and CD4T13 was decreased in CAD+ among DM+Statin+ participants. CD4T12 was increased in DM+ participants. In female participants, CD4T8, 12, and 13 were decreased compared to in male participants. In CD4 T cells, 31 genes showed significant and coordinated upregulation in both CAD and DM. The DM gene signature was partially additive to the CAD gene signature.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that CAD and DM are clearly reflected in PBMC transcriptomes and that significant differences exist between women and men and between subjects treated with statins or not.",

    "abstract": "The agricultural productivity of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is severely constrained by pests and pathogens, impacting economic stability and food security. Since 2004, an epidemic of cassava brown streak disease (CBSD) has been spreading rapidly from Uganda, with the disease causing necrosis of the edible root tissue. Based on sparse surveillance data, the epidemic front is currently believed to be at least as far west as central DRC and as far south as Zambia. The DRC is the worlds highest per capita consumer of cassava and future spread threatens production in West Africa which includes Nigeria, the worlds largest producer of cassava. Here, we take a unique Ugandan CBSD surveillance dataset spanning 2004 to 2017 and develop, parameterise, and validate a landscape-scale, spatiotemporal epidemic model of CBSD at a 1 km2 resolution. While this paper focuses on Uganda, the model is designed to be readily extended to make predictions beyond Uganda for all 32 major cassava producing countries of SSA, laying the foundations for a tool capable of informing strategic policy decisions at a national and regional scale.",

    "abstract": "Why warning patterns are so diverse is an enduring evolutionary puzzle. Because predators associate particular patterns with unpleasant experiences, an individuals predation risk should decrease as the local density of its warning pattern increases, promoting pattern monomorphism. Distasteful Heliconius butterflies are known for their diversity of warning patterns. Here, we explore whether interlocus sexual conflict can contribute to their diversification. Male Heliconius use warning patterns as mating cues, but mated females may suffer costs if this leads to harassment, favoring novel patterns. Using simulations, we show that drift alone is unlikely to cause pattern diversification, but that sexual conflict can assist such process. We also find that genetic architecture influences the evolution of male preferences, which track changes in warning pattern due to sexual selection. When male attraction imposes costs on females, this affects the speed at which novel pattern alleles increase. In two experiments, females laid fewer eggs with males present. However, although males in one experiment showed less interest in females with manipulated patterns, we found no evidence that female coloration mitigates sex-specific costs. Overall, male attraction to conspecific warning patterns may impose an unrecognized cost on Heliconius females, but further work is required to determine this experimentally.",

    "abstract": "Diapause is one of the most important traits that have sustained insects to thrive. Insects can prospectively arrest their development and increase environmental stress-resistance by entering diapause. The photoperiod is the signal that indicates insects the proper timing to enter diapause. Circadian clock genes are shown to be involved in photoperiodic diapause induction in various insect species. The silkworm, Bombyx mori, enters diapause at the embryonic stage. In bivoltine strains, diapause determination is affected by embryonic temperature and photoperiodic conditions during embryonic and larval stages. Two independent studies showed that knocking out the core clock gene, period, perturb photoperiodic diapause induction. However, whether the circadian clock as whole or individual clock genes are responsible for the photoperiodic diapause induction remains unknown. In this study, using CRISPR/Cas9 we knocked out negative (period and timeless) and positive elements (Clock and cycle) in p50T, a bivoltine strain which exhibits photoperiodic diapause induction during both embryonic and larval stages. The temporal expression patterns of clock genes changed in each core clock gene knockout strain, suggesting disruption of normal feedback loops produced by circadian clock genes. Furthermore, photoperiodic diapause induction during both embryonic and larval stages was lost in all knockout strains. Our results indicate the involvement of circadian clock in photoperiodic diapause induction in B. mori.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe established knockout Bombyx mori strains of four core clock genes\nC_LIO_LIThe temporal expression patterns of clock genes changed in knockout strains\nC_LIO_LIPhotoperiodic diapause induction was not observed in any knockout strains\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "PurposeExtremely preterm infants are at risk of developing retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), characterized by an initial insufficient vascular network development in the retina (due to hyperoxia) that progress to neovascularization and neuroinflammation (hypoxic phase) ultimately leading to partial or total vision loss. Lipid metabolism has been shown to be a significant pathway that is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis in oxygen induced retinopathy mouse model, however, it is not explored in human ROP patients. The present study aimed to explore the association of lipid metabolizing, angiogenic and apoptotic genes with altered lipid metabolites in the ROP patients with different severity.\n\nMethodsThe blood, vitreous humor (VH), and fibrovascular membrane (FVM) samples were collected from premature infants diagnosed with ROP and controls. Gene expression of lipid metabolizing enzymes, angiogenesis, and apoptotic genes were performed using semi-quantitative PCR in blood. Lipid metabolites were identified and quantified by LC-MS in VH and were correlated with gene expression. The expression of key lipid metabolizing enzymes in severe stages of ROP was assessed by measuring their expression in FVM by immunohistochemistry.\n\nResultsGenes coding for the lipid metabolizing enzymes such as CYP1B1, CYP2C8, COX2, and ALOX15 were upregulated while EPHX2 responsible for the conversion of epoxide fatty acids into diol fatty acids was significantly downregulated in ROP cases. The increase in the metabolic intermediates generated from the lipid metabolism pathway further confirmed the role of these enzymes in ROP. except for EPHX2 which did not show any change in its activity. The glial cells in the FVM of ROP infants too showed a lack of EPHX2 expression. A significantly higher expression of genes involved in angiogenesis (VEGF165/189, NOTCH1, and APH1B) and apoptosis (CASP3/8) correlated with altered activity of lipid metabolizing enzymes (based on metabolites levels) among ROP cases.\n\nConclusionsLipid metabolism may play a significant role in ROP development and progression. EPHX2 activity is a key step in the metabolic pathway of arachidonic acid that mediates and regulates inflammation and vascular pathology in preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "1Swarms of the migratory desert locust can extend over several hundred square kilometres, and starvation compels this ancient pest to devour everything in its path. Theory suggests that gregarious behaviour benefits foraging efficiency over a wide range of spatial food distributions. However, despite the importance of identifying the processes by which swarms locate and select feeding sites to predict their progression, the role of social cohesion during foraging remains elusive. We investigated the evidence accumulation and information integration processes that underlie locusts nutritional decision-making by employing a Bayesian formalism on high-resolution tracking data from foraging locusts. We tested individual gregarious animals and groups of different sizes in a 2-choice behavioural assay in which food patch qualities were either different or similar. We then predicted the decisions of individual locusts based on personally acquired and socially derived evidence by disentangling the relative contributions of each information class. Our study suggests that locusts balance incongruent evidence but reinforce congruent ones, resulting in more confident assessments when evidence aligns. We provide new insights into the interplay between personal experience and social context in locust foraging decisions which constitute a powerful empirical system to study local individual decisions and their consequent collective dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Both DNA- and RNA-based nanotechnologies are remarkably useful for in vitro molecular-scale device engineering and are applied in a vast array of applications. However, while the function of nucleic acid nanostructures is robust under in vitro settings, their implementation in real-world conditions requires overcoming their inherent degradation sensitivity and subsequent loss of function. Viruses are minimalistic yet sophisticated supramolecular assemblies, able to protect their nucleic acid content in inhospitable biological environments. Inspired by this natural ability, we engineered RNA-virus-like particles (VLPs) nanocarriers (NCs). We showed that the VLPs can serve as an excellent protective shell against nuclease-mediated degradation. We then harnessed biological recognition elements and demonstrated how engineered riboswitch NCs can act as a possible disease-modifying treatment for genetic metabolic disorders. The functional riboswitch is capable of selectively and specifically binding metabolites and preventing their self-assembly process and its downstream effects. When applying the riboswitch nano-carriers to an in vivo yeast model of adenine accumulation and self-assembly, significant inhibition of the sensitivity to adenine feeding was observed. In addition, using an amyloid-specific dye, we proved the riboswitch nano-carriers ability to reduce the level of intracellular amyloid-like cytotoxic structures. The potential of this RNA therapeutic technology does not stop at metabolic disorders, as it can be easily fine-tuned to be applied to other conditions and diseases.",

Extracellular matrix (ECM) alternations in healthy breast tissue induced by radiation and its role in tumor recurrence are still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the structure, molecular composition, and mechanical properties of irradiated murine mammary fat pads (MFPs) and developed ECM hydrogels from decellularized tissues to assess the effects of RT-induced ECM changes on breast cancer cell behavior. Irradiated MFPs were characterized by increased ECM deposition and fiber density compared to unirradiated controls, which may provide a platform for cell invasion and proliferation. ECM component changes in collagens I, IV, and VI, and fibronectin were observed following irradiation. Encapsulated TNBC cell proliferation was enhanced in irradiated ECM hydrogels, and morphology analysis indicated an increase in invasive capacity. In addition, TNBC cells co-cultured with macrophages in irradiated ECM hydrogels exhibited further increases in cell proliferation. Our study establishes that the ECM in the irradiated microenvironment promotes TNBC invasion and proliferation that is enhanced in the presence of macrophages. This work represents an important step toward elucidating how changes in the ECM after RT contribute to breast cancer recurrence.",

    "abstract": "Inherited retinal degenerative diseases are a prominent cause of blindness. Even though mutations causing death of photoreceptors are mostly known, the pathophysiology downstream in the inner retina and along the visual pathway is incompletely characterized in the earliest disease stages. Here we investigated retinal, midbrain and cortical visual function using electroretinography (ERG), the optomotor response (OMR), visual evoked potentials (VEPs), respectively, and single unit electrophysiology at the primary visual cortex (V1) in light-adapted juvenile ([~] 1-month-old) and young adult (3-month-old) RhoP23H/WT mice, representative of early-stage retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Photopic ERG revealed up to [~] 30 % hypersensitivity to light in RhoP23H/WT mice, as measured by the light intensity required to generate half-maximal b-wave (I50 parameter). RhoP23H/WT mice also showed increased optomotor responses towards low spatial frequency drifting gratings, indicative of visual overexcitation at the midbrain level. At the V1 level, VEPs and single-cell recordings revealed prominent hyperexcitability in the juvenile RhoP23H/WT mice. Mean VEP amplitudes for light ON stimuli were nearly doubled in 1-month-old RhoP23H/WT mice compared to controls, and more than doubled for light OFF. Single-cell recordings showed a significantly increased spontaneous V1 neuron firing in the RhoP23H/WT mice, and persistent contrast and temporal sensitivities. In contrast, direction selectivity was severely compromised. Our data suggest that during early RP, the visual pathway becomes hyperexcited. This could have both compensatory and deleterious consequences for visual behavior. Further studies on the mechanisms of hyperexcitability are warranted as this could lead to therapeutic interventions for RP.\n\nSignificance statementLost retinal function in many blinding retinal degenerative disorders could soon be alleviated by advanced therapies that restore photoreception. However, it is unknown whether a visual system rewired downstream of the photoreceptors can process signals adequately. We studied the functional consequences of early rod death along the visual pathway in young retinitis pigmentosa (RP) mice. Photopic inner retina responses were moderately hypersensitized in the electroretinograms of RP mice. Reflex-based visual behavior and visual cortex electrophysiology showed hyperexcitability. Some aspects of complex visual processing were remarkably resistant to degeneration, whereas others were severely impacted. We conclude that the visual system adapts to lost photoreception by increasing sensitivity, but simultaneously becomes detrimentally hyperexcited. Mechanistic understanding could lead to therapeutic preservation and restoration of vision.",

    "abstract": "Sweet basil, Ocimum basilicum L., is an important culinary herb grown worldwide. Although basil is green, many landraces, breeding lines and exotic cultivars have purple stems and flowers. This anthocyanins pigmentation is unacceptable in the traditional Italian basil. We used the recently published sweet basil genome to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flower and stem color in a bi-parental F2 population. It was found that the pigmentation is governed by a single QTL, harboring an anthocyanidin synthase (ANS) gene. Further analysis revealed that the basil genome harbors two homeologous ANS genes, each carrying a loss-of-function mutation. ObANS1 carries a 1-bp insertion, and ObANS2 carries a missense mutation within the active site. In the purple-flower parent, ANS1 is functional and ANS2 carries a nonsense mutation. The functionality of the active allele was validated by complementation in an Arabidopsis ANS mutant. Moreover, we have restored the functionality of the missense-mutated ANS2 using site-directed activation. We found that the non-functional alleles were expressed to similar levels as the functional allele, suggesting polyploids invest futile effort in expressing non-functional genes, harming their superior redundancy. We show here we can harness basils genomics and genetics to understand the basic mechanism of metabolic traits.",

    "abstract": "We describe a novel microscopy for studying the network of axons in the unlabeled fresh wholemount retina. The intrinsic radiation of second harmonic generation (SHG) was utilized to visualize single axons of all major retinal neurons, i.e., photoreceptors, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and the retinal ganglion cells. The cell types of SHG+ axons were determined using transgenic GFP/YFP mice. New findings were obtained with retinal SHG imaging: Muller cells do not maintain uniformly polarized microtubules in the processes; SHG+ axons of bipolar cells terminate in the inner plexiform layer (IPL) in a subtype-specific manner; a subset of amacrine cells, presumably the axon-bearing types, emits SHG; and the axon-like neurites of amacrine cells provide a cytoskeletal scaffolding for the IPL stratification. To demonstrate the utility, retinal SHG imaging was applied for testing whether the inner retina is preserved in glaucoma, using DBA/2 mice as a model of glaucoma and DBA/2-Gpnmb+ as the non-glaucomatous control. It was found that the morphology of the inner retina was largely intact in glaucoma and the pre-synaptic compartments to the retinal ganglion cells were uncompromised. It proves retinal SHG imaging as a promising technology for studying the physiological and diseased retina in 3D.",

    "abstract": "Pattern recognition receptors are crucial for innate anti-viral immunity, including C-type lectin receptors. Two such examples are Lung surfactant protein D (SP-D) and Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecules-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) which are soluble and membrane-bound C-type lectin receptors, respectively. SP-D has a crucial immune function in detecting and clearing pulmonary pathogens; DC-SIGN is involved in facilitating dendritic cell interaction as an antigen-presenting cell with naive T cells to mount an anti-viral immune response. Both SP-D and DC-SIGN have been shown to interact with various viruses, including HIV-1, Influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped RNA virus that causes COVID-19. A recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) comprising of -helical neck region, carbohydrate recognition domain, and eight N-terminal Gly-X-Y repeats has been shown to bind SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication by preventing viral entry in Vero cells and HEK293T cells expressing ACE2. DC-SIGN has also been shown to act as a cell surface receptor for SARS-CoV-2 independent of ACE2. Since rfhSP-D is known to interact with SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN, this study was aimed at investigating the potential of rfhSP-D in modulating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Coincubation of rfhSP-D with Spike protein improved the Spike Protein: DC-SIGN interaction. Molecular dynamic studies revealed that rfhSP-D stabilised the interaction between DC-SIGN and Spike protein. Cell binding analysis with DC-SIGN expressing HEK 293T and THP-1 cells and rfhSP-D treated SARS-CoV-2 Spike pseudotypes confirmed the increased binding. Furthermore, infection assays using the pseudotypes revealed their increased uptake by DC-SIGN expressing cells. The immunomodulatory effect of rfhSP-D on the DC-SIGN: Spike protein interaction on DC-SIGN expressing epithelial and macrophage-like cell lines was also assessed by measuring the mRNA expression of cytokines and chemokines. The RT-qPCR analysis showed that rfhSP-D treatment downregulated the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as TNF-, IFN-, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES (as well as NF-{kappa}B) in DC-SIGN expressing cells challenged by Spike protein. Furthermore, rfhSP-D treatment was found to downregulate the mRNA levels of MHC class II in DC expressing THP-1 when compared to the untreated controls. We conclude that rfhSP-D helps stabilise the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and DC-SIGN and increases viral uptake by macrophages via DC-SIGN, suggesting an additional role for rfhSP-D in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Whole genome duplication (WGD) is a dramatic evolutionary event generating many new genes and which may play a role in survival through mass extinctions. Paddlefish and sturgeon are sister lineages that both show genomic evidence for ancient WGD. Until now this has been interpreted as two independent WGD events due to a preponderance of duplicate genes with independent histories. Here we show that although there is indeed a plurality of apparently  independent gene duplications, these derive from a shared genome duplication event occurring close to the Permian-Triassic mass extinction period, followed by a prolonged process of reversion to stable diploid inheritance (rediploidisation). We show that the sharing of this WGD is masked by the fact that paddlefish and sturgeon lineage divergence occurred before rediploidisation had proceeded even half-way. Thus, for most genes the resolution to diploidy was lineage-specific. Because genes are only truly duplicated once diploid inheritance is established, the paddlefish and sturgeon genomes are a mosaic of shared and non-shared gene duplications resulting from a shared genome duplication event. This is the first time that lineage-specific resolution of genes from a common WGD event has been shown to affect such a large proportion of the genome.",

We collected SARS-COV-2 sequence data from the end of 2019 to April 2022 to analyze for their evolutionary features during the pandemic. We found that most of the SARS-COV-2 genes are undergoing negative purifying selection, while the spike protein gene (S-gene) is undergoing rapid positive selection. From the original strain to the alpha, delta and omicron variant types, the Ka/Ks of the S-gene increases, while the Ka/Ks within one variant type decreases over time. During the evolution, the codon usage did not evolve towards optimal translation and protein expression. In contrast, only S-gene mutations showed a remarkable trend on accumulating more positive charges. This facilitates the infection via binding human ACE2 for cell entry and binding furin for cleavage. Such a functional evolution emphasizes the survival strategy of SARS-COV-2, and indicated new druggable target to contain the viral infection. The nearly fully positively-charged interaction surfaces indicated that the infectivity of SARS-COV-2 virus may approach a limit.",

The coding sequences of S1 region varied among isolates, whereas other genetic regions were highly conserved. Isolates were efficiently grown in Vero-RcACE2 cells, but did not replicate in Vero/TMPRSS2 cells stably expressing human ACE2, suggesting a narrow host range.

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is a filamentous fungus that can infect the lungs of patients with immunosuppression and/or underlying lung-diseases. The mortality associated with chronic and invasive aspergillosis infections remain very high, despite availability of antifungal treatments. In the last decade, there has been a worrisome emergence and spread of resistance to the first line antifungals, the azoles. The mortality caused by resistant isolates is even higher, and patient management is complicated as the therapeutic options are reduced. Nevertheless, treatment failure is also common in patients infected with azole-susceptible isolates, which can be due to several non- mutually exclusive reasons, such as poor drug absorption. In addition, the phenomena of tolerance or persistence, where susceptible pathogens can survive the action of an antimicrobial for extended periods, have been associated with treatment failure in bacterial infections, and their occurrence in fungal infections already proposed. Here, we demonstrate that some isolates of A. fumigatus display persistence to voriconazole. A sub-population of the persister isolates can survive for extended periods and even grow at slow rates in the presence of supra-MIC (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration) of voriconazole and seemingly other azoles. Persistence cannot be eradicated with adjuvant drugs or antifungal combinations and seems to reduce the efficacy of treatment for certain individuals in a Galleria mellonella model of infection. Furthermore, persistence implies a distinct transcriptional profile, demonstrating that it is an active response. We propose that azole persistence might be a relevant and underestimated factor that could influence the outcome of infection in human aspergillosis.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe phenomena of antibacterial tolerance and persistence, where pathogenic microbes can survive for extended periods in the presence of cidal drug concentrations, have received significant attention in the last decade. Several mechanisms of action have been elucidated, and their relevance for treatment failure in bacterial infections demonstrated. In contrast, our knowledge about antifungal tolerance and, particularly, persistence are still very scarce. In this study, we have characterised the response of the prominent fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus to the first line therapy antifungal voriconazole. We comprehensively show that some isolates display persistence to this fungicidal antifungal and identify various potential mechanisms of action. In addition, using an alternative model of infection, we provide initial evidence to suggest that persistence may cause treatment failure in some individuals. Therefore, we propose that azole persistence is an important factor to consider and further investigate in A. fumigatus.",

    "abstract": "Ewings sarcoma is the second most common bone malignancy in children or young adults and is caused by an oncogenic transcription factor by a chromosomal translocation between the EWSR1 gene and the ETS transcription factor family. However, the transcriptional mechanism of EWS-ETS fusion proteins is still unclear. To identify the transcriptional complexes of EWS-ETS fusion transcription factors, we applied a proximal labeling system called BioID in Ewings sarcoma cells. We identified AHDC1 as a proximal protein of EWS-ETS fusion proteins. AHDC1 knockdown showed a reduced cell growth and transcriptional activity of EWS-FLI1. AHDC1 knockdown also reduced BRD4 and BRG1 protein levels, both known as interacting proteins of EWS-FLI1. In addition, AHDC1 co-localized with BRD4. Our results suggest that AHDC1 supports cell growth through EWS-FLI1.",

    "abstract": "Livestock production contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, there is a considerable variability in the carbon footprint associated with livestock production. Site specific estimates of GHG emissions are needed to accurately focus GHG emission reduction efforts. A holistic approach must be taken to assess the full environmental impact of livestock production using appropriate geographical scale. The objective of this study was to determine baseline GHG emissions from dairy production in South Dakota using a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. A cradle-to-farm gate LCA was used to estimate the GHG emissions to produce 1 kg of energy-and-protein corrected milk (ECM) in South Dakota. The system boundary was divided into feed production, farm management, enteric methane emissions, and manure management as these activities are the main contributors to the overall GHG emissions. The production of 1 kg ECM in South Dakota dairies was estimated to emit 1.21 kg CO2 equivalents. The major contributors were enteric methane emissions (46.3%) and manure management (32.6%). Feed production and farm management made up 13.9 and 7.2 %, respectively. The estimate was similar to the national average but slightly higher than the California dairy system. The source of corn used in the dairies influences the footprint. For example, South Dakota corn had fewer GHG emissions than grain produced in Iowa. Therefore, locally and more sustainably sourced feed input will contribute to further reducing the environmental impacts. Improvements in efficiency of milk production through better genetics, nutrition animal welfare and feed production are expected to further reduce the carbon footprint of South Dakota dairies. Furthermore, use of feed additives and anaerobic digesters will reduce emissions from enteric and manure sources, respectively.",
