    "abstract": "Despite the importance of the cerebellum for motor learning, and the recognised role of sleep in motor memory consolidation, surprisingly little is known about activity in the sleeping cerebro-cerebellar system. Here we used wireless recording from M1 and the cerebellum in monkeys to examine the relationship between patterns of single-unit spiking activity observed during waking behaviour and in natural sleep. Across the population of recorded units, we observed similarities in the timing of firing relative to local field potential features associated with both movements during waking and up-states during sleep. We also observed a consistent pattern of asymmetry in pair-wise cross-correlograms, indicative of preserved sequential firing in both wake and sleep at low frequencies. Despite the overall similarity in population dynamics between wake and sleep, there was a global change in the timing of cerebellar activity relative to motor cortex, from contemporaneous in the awake state, to motor cortex preceding the cerebellum in sleep. We speculate that similar population dynamics in waking and sleep may imply that cerebellar internal models are activated in both states, but that their output is decoupled from motor cortex in sleep. Nevertheless, spindle frequency coherence between the cerebellum and motor cortex may provide a mechanism for cerebellar computations to influence sleep-dependent learning processes in the cortex.\n\nSignificance statementIt is well known that sleep can lead to improved motor performance. One possibility is that synaptic changes during sleep result from off-line repetitions of neuronal activity patterns in brain areas responsible for the control of movement. In this study we show for the first time that neuronal patterns in the cerebro-cerebellar system are conserved during both movements and sleep up-states, albeit with a shift in the relative timing between areas. Additionally, we show the presence of simultaneous M1-cerebellar spike coherence at spindle frequencies associated with up-state replay and postulate that this is a mechanism whereby a cerebellar internal models can shape plasticity in neocortical circuits during sleep.",

    "abstract": "Pathologically increased beta power has been described as a biomarker for Parkinsons disease (PD) and related to prolonged bursts of subthalamic beta synchronization. Here, we investigate the association between subthalamic beta dynamics and motor impairment in a cohort of 106 Parkinsons patients in the ON- and OFF-medication state, suing two different methods of beta burst determination. We report a frequency-specific correlation of low beta power and burst duration with motor impairment OFF dopaminergic medication. Furthermore, reduction of power and burst duration correlated significantly with symptom alleviation through dopaminergic medication. Importantly, qualitatively similar results were yielded with two different methods of beta burst definition. Our findings validate the robustness of previous results on pathological changes in subcortical oscillations both in the frequency-as well as in the time-domain in the largest cohort of PD patients to date with important implications for next-generation adaptive deep brain stimulation control algorithms.",

    "abstract": "postpartum depression (PPD) is a severe psychiatric disorder that affects up to 15% of mothers and impairs mother-infant bonding with devastating consequences on the child development and the mother health. Several studies indicate a possible dysregulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic signalling in the corticolimbic system, as well as a downregulation of the allopregnanolone levels in serum of PPD patients. Although brexanolone, an allopregnanolone-based treatment, has recently emerged as fundamental PPD treatment, there is scarce evidence on its neurobiological action mechanism. Moreover, ketamine appears to be a promising antidepressant treatment preventing PPD, nevertheless whether it might be a more effective than allopregnanolone for some patients remain unknown. Therefore, the present study is aimed to evaluate the depressive-like phenotype of postpartum females undergoing maternal separation with early weaning (MSEW) protocol, as well as to compare the effectiveness of ketamine and allopregnanolone treatments. MSEW dams show increased despair-like behaviour, anhedonia and disrupted maternal behaviour. Moreover, lower allopregnanolone serum levels, reduction of vesicular transporters for GABA (VGAT) and glutamate (VGLUT1) in the infralimbic cortex, as well as decreased hippocampal cellular proliferation are found in MSEW females. As for the antidepressant treatments, both drugs prevent despair-like behaviour, whereas only ketamine reverts anhedonia present in MSEW females. In addition, both treatments induce pro-neurogenic effects in the dorsal hippocampus but only allopregnanolone increases the VGAT and VGLUT1, without altering the excitatory/inhibitory ratio. Altogether, we propose a new mice model that recapitulates the core symptomatology and alterations in glutamatergic and GABAergic systems shown in PPD patients, which allows us to investigate the therapeutic mechanisms of allopregnanolone and ketamine.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous retroviruses, remnants of viral germline infections, make up a substantial proportion of the mammalian genome. While usually epigenetically silenced, retroelements can become upregulated in neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein aggregation, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and tauopathies. Here we demonstrate that spontaneous upregulation of endogenous retrovirus gene expression drastically affects the dissemination of protein aggregates between murine cells in culture. Viral glycoprotein Env mediates membrane association between donor and recipient cells and promotes the intercellular transfer of protein aggregates packaged into extracellular vesicles. Proteopathic seed spreading can be inhibited by neutralizing antibodies targeting Env as well as drugs inhibiting viral protein processing. Importantly, we show that also overexpression of a human endogenous retrovirus Env elevates intercellular spreading of pathological Tau. Our data highlight the potential influence of endogenous retroviral proteins on protein misfolding diseases and suggest that antiviral drugs could represent promising candidates for inhibiting protein aggregate spreading.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous bornavirus-like elements (EBLs) are heritable sequences derived from bornaviruses in vertebrate genomes that originate from transcripts of ancient bornaviruses. EBLs have been detected using sequence similarity searches such as tBLASTn, whose technical limitations may hinder the detection of EBLs derived from small and/or rapidly evolving viral X and P genes. Indeed, no EBLs derived from the X and P genes of orthobornaviruses have been detected to date in vertebrate genomes. Here, we aimed to develop a novel strategy to detect such \"hidden\" EBLs. To this aim, we focused on the 1.9 kb read-through transcript of orthobornaviruses, which encodes a well-conserved N gene and small and rapidly evolving X and P genes. We show a series of evidence supporting the existence of EBLs derived from orthobornaviral X and P genes (EBLX/Ps) in mammalian genomes. Furthermore, we found that an EBLX/P is expressed as a fusion transcript with the cellular gene, ZNF451, which potentially encodes the ZNF451/EBLP fusion protein in miniopterid bat cells. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of ancient bornaviruses and co-evolution between bornaviruses and their hosts. Furthermore, our data suggest that endogenous viral elements detected thus far are just the tip of the iceberg, and further studies are required to understand ancient viruses more accurately.",

    "abstract": "Light availability drives vertical canopy gradients in photosynthetic functioning and carbon (C) balance, yet patterns of variability in these gradients remain unclear. We measured light availability, photosynthetic CO2 and light response curves, foliar C, nitrogen (N) and pigment concentrations, and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) on upper and lower canopy needles of white spruce trees (Picea glauca) at the species northern and southern range extremes. We combined our photosynthetic data with previously published respiratory data to compare and contrast canopy C balance between latitudinal extremes. We found steep canopy gradients in irradiance, photosynthesis, and leaf traits at the southern range limit, but a lack of variation across canopy positions at the northern range limit. Thus, unlike many tree species from tropical to mid-latitude forests, high latitude trees may not require vertical gradients of metabolic activity to optimize photosynthetic C gain. Consequently, accounting for self-shading is less critical for predicting gross primary productivity at northern relative to southern latitudes. Northern trees also had a significantly smaller net positive leaf C balance than southern trees suggesting that, regardless of canopy position, low photosynthetic rates coupled with high respiratory costs may ultimately constrain the northern range limit of this widely distributed boreal species.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTCanopy gradients in photosynthetic capacity of white spruce diminish at high compared to low latitudes. Low carbon balance in high latitude trees may determine the extent of northern treeline.",

    "abstract": "De novo mutations (DNMs) play an important role in severe genetic disorders that reduce fitness. To better understand the role of DNMs in disease, it is important to determine the parent-of-origin and timing of the mutational events that give rise to the mutations, especially in sex-specific developmental disorders such as male infertility. However, currently available short-read sequencing approaches are not ideally suited for phasing as this requires long continuous DNA strands that span both the DNM and one or more informative SNPs. To overcome these challenges, we optimised and implemented a multiplexed long-read sequencing approach using the Oxford Nanopore technologies MinION platform. We specifically focused on improving target amplification, integrating long-read sequenced data with high-quality short-read sequence data, and developing an anchored phasing computational method. This approach was able to handle the inherent phasing challenges that arise from long-range target amplification and the normal accumulation of sequencing error associated with long-read sequencing. In total, 77 out of 109 DNMs (71%) were successfully phased and parent-of-origin identified. The majority of phased DNMs were prezygotic (90%), the accuracy of which is highlighted by the average mutant allele frequency of 49.6% and a standard error margin of 0.84%. This study demonstrates the benefits of using an integrated short-read and long-read sequencing approach for large-scale DNM phasing.",

    "abstract": "The microvasculature plays a key role in oxygen transport in the mammalian brain. Despite the close coupling between cerebral vascular geometry and local oxygen demand, recent experiments have reported that microvascular occlusions can lead to unexpected distant tissue hypoxia and infarction. To better understand the spatial correlation between the hypoxic regions and the occlusion sites, we used both in vivo experiments and in silico simulations to investigate the effects of occlusions in cerebral penetrating arteriole trees on tissue hypoxia. In a rat model of microembolisation, 25 {micro}m microspheres were injected through the carotid artery to occlude penetrating arterioles. In representative models of human cortical columns, the penetrating arterioles were occluded by simulating the transport of microspheres of the same size and the oxygen transport was simulated using a Greens function method. The locations of microspheres and hypoxic regions were segmented, and two novel distance analyses were implemented to study their spatial correlation. The distant hypoxic regions were found to be present in both experiments and simulations, and mainly due to the hypoperfusion in the region downstream of the occlusion site. Furthermore, a reasonable agreement for the spatial correlation between hypoxic regions and occlusion sites is shown between experiments and simulations, which indicates the good applicability of in silico models in understanding the response of cerebral blood flow and oxygen transport to microemboli.\n\nAuthor summaryThe brain function depends on the continuous oxygen supply through the bloodstream inside the microvasculature. Occlusions in the microvascular network will disturb the oxygen delivery in the brain and result in hypoxic tissues that can lead to infarction and cognitive dysfunction. To aid in understanding the formation of hypoxic tissues caused by micro-occlusions in the penetrating arteriole trees, we use rodent experiments and simulations of human vascular networks to study the spatial correlations between the hypoxic regions and the occlusion locations. Our results suggest that hypoxic regions can form distally from the occlusion site, which agrees with the previous observations in the rat brain. These distant hypoxic regions are primarily due to the lack of blood flow in the brain tissues downstream of the occlusion. Moreover, a reasonable agreement of the spatial relationship is found between the experiments and the simulations, which indicates the applicability of in silico models to study the effects of microemboli on the brain tissue.",

    "abstract": "MotivationAs complex tissues are typically composed of various cell types, deconvolution tools have been developed to computationally infer their cellular composition from bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. To comprehensively assess deconvolution performance, gold-standard datasets are indispensable. Gold-standard, experimental techniques like flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry are resource-intensive and cannot be systematically applied to the numerous cell types and tissues profiled with high-throughput transcriptomics. The simulation of  pseudo-bulk data, generated by aggregating single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) expression profiles in pre-defined proportions, offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative. This makes it feasible to create in silico gold standards that allow fine-grained control of cell-type fractions not conceivable in an experimental setup. However, at present, no simulation software for generating pseudo-bulk RNA-seq data exists.\n\nResultsWe developed SimBu, an R package capable of simulating pseudo-bulk samples based on various simulation scenarios, designed to test specific features of deconvolution methods. A unique feature of SimBu is the modelling of cell-type-specific mRNA bias using experimentally-derived or data-driven scaling factors. Here, we show that SimBu can generate realistic pseudo-bulk data, recapitulating the biological and statistical features of real RNA-seq data. Finally, we illustrate the impact of mRNA bias on the evaluation of deconvolution tools and provide recommendations for the selection of suitable methods for estimating mRNA content.\n\nConclusionSimBu is a user-friendly and flexible tool for simulating realistic pseudo-bulk RNA-seq datasets serving as in silico gold-standard for assessing cell-type deconvolution methods.\n\nAvailabilitySimBu is freely available at https://github.com/omnideconv/SimBu as an R package under the GPL-3 license.\n\nContactalex.dietrich@tum.de and markus.list@tum.de\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Previous studies showed that the patients neoantigen candidate load is an imperfect predictor of the response to ICB. Further studies provided evidence that the overall response to ICB is also affected by the qualitative properties of a few or even single candidates, limiting the predictive power based on candidate quantity alone.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to predict the response to ICB therapy based on qualitative neoantigen candidate profiles in the context of the mutation type, using a multiple instance learning approach. Multiple instance learning is a special branch of machine learning which classifies labelled bags that are formed by a set of unlabeled instances. The multiple instance learning approach performed systematically better than random guessing and was independent of the neoantigen candidate load. Qualitative modeling performed better in comparison to the quantitative approach, in particular for modelling low-abundant fusion genes. Our findings suggest that multiple instance learning is an appropriate method to predict immunotherapy efficacy based on qualitative neoantigen candidate profiles without relying on direct T-cell response information and provide a foundation for future developments in the field.",

    "abstract": "Major climatic and ecological changes are documented in terrestrial ecosystems during the Miocene epoch. The Rhinocerotidae are a very interesting clade to investigate the impact of these changes on ecology, as they are abundant and diverse in the fossil record throughout the Miocene. Here, we explored the spatio-temporal evolution of rhinocerotids paleoecology during the early and middle Miocene of Europe and Pakistan. We studied the dental texture microwear (proxy for diet) and enamel hypoplasia (stress indicator) of 19 species belonging to four sub-tribes and an unnamed clade of Rhinocerotidae, and coming from nine Eurasian localities ranging from Mammal Neogene zone (MN) 2 to MN7/8. Our results suggest clear differences in the feeding ecology and thus niche partitioning at Kumbi 4 (MN2, Pakistan), Sansan (MN6, France), and Villefranche dAstarac (MN7/8, France), while overlap of the interpreted diets and subtle variations are discussed for Beon 1 (MN4, France) and Gra[c]anica (MN5/6, Bosnia-Herzegovina). All rhinocerotids studied were interpreted as browsers or mixed-feeders, and none had a grazer nor frugivore diet. The prevalence of hypoplasia was moderate ([~] 10 %) to high (> 20 %) at all localities but Kumbi 4 ([~] 6%), and documented quite well the local conditions. For instance, the high prevalence at the close to Miocene Climatic Optimum locality of Beon 1 ([~]26 %) has been correlated with periodical droughts, while the moderate ones ([~] 10 %) at Sansan and Devinska Nova Ves Spalte (Slovakia) both dated from the MN6 (i.e., by the middle Miocene Climatic Transition, ca. 13.9 Mya) were linked to the persistence of sub-tropical local conditions. Besides locality, species and tooth locus were also important factors of variation for the prevalence of hypoplasia. The very large hippo-like Brachypotherium brachypus was one of the most affected species at all concerned localities (but Sansan), whereas early-diverging elasmotheriines were very little affected, suggesting an influence of phylogeny and/or diet in stress susceptibility.",

Continuous recordings of LWC are therefore central for the investigation of the regulatory networks stabilizing leaf hydration. Available measurement methods, however, either influence local hydration, interfere with the local leaf micro-environment or cannot easily be combined with other techniques. To overcome these limitations a non-invasive sensor was developed which uses light transmission in the NIR range for precise continuous recordings of LWC. For LWC measurements the transmission ratio of two NIR wavelengths was recorded using a leaf-specific calibration. Pulsed measurement beams enabled measurements under ambient light conditions. The contact-free sensor allows miniaturization and can be integrated into many different experimental settings. Example measurements of LWC during disturbances and recoveries of leaf water balance show the high precision and temporal resolution of the LWC sensor and demonstrate possible method combinations. Simultaneous measurements of LWC and transpiration allows to calculate petiole influx informing about the dynamic leaf water balance. With simultaneous measurements of stomatal apertures the relevant stomatal and hydraulic processes are covered, allowing insights into dynamic properties of the involved positive and negative feed-back loops.",

    "abstract": "The Neurovisceral Integration Model posits that shared neural networks support the effective regulation of emotions and heart rate, with heart rate variability (HRV) serving as an objective, peripheral index of prefrontal inhibitory control. Prior neuroimaging studies have predominantly examined both HRV and associated neural functional connectivity at rest, as opposed to contexts that require active emotion regulation. The present study sought to extend upon previous resting-state functional connectivity findings, examining HRV and corresponding amygdala functional connectivity during a cognitive reappraisal task. Seventy adults (52 old and 18 young adults, 18-84 years, 51% male) received instructions to cognitively reappraise negative and neutral affective images during functional MRI scanning. HRV measures were derived from a finger pulse signal throughout the scan. During the task, young adults exhibited a significant inverse association between HRV and amygdala-medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) functional connectivity, in which higher HRV was correlated with weaker amygdala-mPFC coupling, whereas old adults displayed a slight positive, albeit non-significant correlation. Furthermore, voxelwise whole-brain functional connectivity analyses showed that higher HRV was linked to weaker right amygdala-posterior cingulate cortex connectivity across old and young adults, and in old adults, higher HRV positively correlated with stronger right amygdala - right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex connectivity. Collectively, these findings highlight the importance of assessing HRV and neural functional connectivity during active regulatory contexts to further identify neural concomitants of HRV and adaptive emotion regulation.",

    "abstract": "The claustrum is highly interconnected with many structures in the brain, but the organizing principles governing its vast connectivity have yet to be fully explored. We investigated the defining characteristics and activity of single claustrum neurons, the nature of their relationship with the cortex, and their connectivity within the claustrum itself to gain a comprehensive view of claustral circuits. We show that the claustrum is composed of excitatory and inhibitory cell types that are connected through intraclaustral excitatory synapses, especially between neurons with disparate projection targets. Investigations of corticoclaustral innervation demonstrated that axons from the cortex localize to distinct dorsoventral modules depending on their region of origin. In vitro dual-color optogenetic mapping experiments revealed that individual claustrum neurons integrated inputs from more than one cortical region in a cell type- and projection target-specific manner. Integration in claustrum neurons was observed to be particularly common between areas of the frontal cortex and less so for sensory, motor, and association cortices. Finally, activity in claustrum axons in midline cortical areas recorded with in vivo two-photon calcium imaging showed responses to multimodal sensory stimuli. Our findings shed light on the organizing principles of claustrum circuits, demonstrating that individual claustrum neurons integrate cortical inputs and redistribute this information back to cortex after performing output target- and cell type-dependent local computations.",

    "abstract": "The ectoparasitic mite, Varroa destructor and the viruses it vectors, including types A and B of Deformed wing virus (DWV), pose a major threat to honey bees, Apis mellifera. Analysis of 256 mites collected from the same set of colonies on five occasions from May to October 2021 showed that less than a half of them, 39.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 34.0 - 46.0%), were able to induce an overt-level DWV infection with more than 109 viral genomes per bee in the pupa after 6 days of feeding, with both DWV-A and DWV-B being vectored at similar rates. To investigate the effect of the phoretic stage on the mites ability to vector DWV, the mites from two field collection events were divided into two groups, one of which was tested immediately for their infectiveness, and the other was kept with adult worker bees in cages for 12 days prior to testing their infectiveness. We found that while 39.2 % (95% CI: 30.0 - 49.1%) of the immediately tested mites induced overt-level DWV infections, 12-day phoretic passage significantly increased the infectiousness of mites to 89.8% (95% CI: 79.2 - 95.6%). It is likely that Varroa mites that survive brood interruptions in field colonies are increasingly infectious. We found that mite lifespan was significantly affected by the type of DWV it transmitted to pupae. The mites, which induced overt DWV-B but not DWV-A infection had an average lifespan of 15.5 days (95% CI: 11.8 - 19.2 days), which was significantly shorter than those of the mites which induced overt DWV-A but not DWV-B infection, with an average lifespan of 24.3 days (95% CI: 20.2 - 28.5), or the mites which did not induce high levels of DWV-A or DWV-B, with an average survival of 21.2 days (95% CI: 19.0 - 23.5 days). The mites which transmitted high levels of both DWV-A and DWV-B had an intermediate average survival of 20.5 days (95% CI: 15.1 - 25.9 days). The negative impact of DWV-B on mite survival could be a consequence of the ability of DWV-B, but not DWV-A to replicate in Varroa mites.",

One strategy that evades viral escape is using the entry receptor, human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (hACE2). Soluble hACE2 receptor domains show potential as decoys but genetic modifications are necessary to provide sufficient efficacy. However, these engineered constructs are potentially susceptible to viral escape. We combined native hACE2 with viral vectors to form nanoparticles presenting hACE2 analogous to human cells. Cell-based viral infection assays and cryogenic in-situ tomography show that hACE2 nanoparticles sequester viruses through aggregation, efficiently blocking entry of SARS-CoV-2 and its variants in model cell systems and human respiratory tract explants using native hACE2. Thus, we show that hACE2 nanoparticles have high potential as pan-variant COVID19 therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Hydrodynamic flow produced by multi-ciliated cells is critical for fluid circulation and cell motility. Hundreds of cilia beat with metachronal synchrony for fluid flow. Cilia-driven fluid flow produces extracellular hydrodynamic forces that cause neighboring cilia to beat in a synchronized manner. However, hydrodynamic coupling between neighboring cilia is not the sole mechanism that drives cilia synchrony. Cilia are nucleated by basal bodies (BBs) that link to each other and to the cells cortex via BB-associated appendages. The intracellular BB and cortical network is hypothesized to synchronize ciliary beating by transmitting cilia coordination cues. The extent of intracellular ciliary connections and the nature of these stimuli remain unclear. Moreover, how BB connections influence the dynamics of individual cilia has not been established. We show by FIB-SEM imaging that cilia are coupled both longitudinally and laterally in the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila by the underlying BB and cortical cytoskeletal network. To visualize the behavior of individual cilia in live, immobilized Tetrahymena cells, we developed Delivered Iron Particle Ubiety Live Light-(DIPULL) microscopy. Quantitative and computer analyses of ciliary dynamics reveal that BB connections control ciliary waveform and coordinate ciliary beating. Loss of BB connections reduces cilia-dependent fluid flow forces.\n\nSummarySoh et al investigate whether intracellular connections between basal bodies control ciliary behavior in multi-ciliated cells. Using a Tetrahymena live cell immobilization technique to quantify ciliary dynamics, they show that inter-BB connections are required for effective ciliary waveform and coordinated ciliary beating that promotes fluid flow.",

    "abstract": "The Base Excision Repair (BER) pathway repairs oxidative DNA damage, a common and detrimental form of damage to the genome. Although biochemical steps in BER have been well define, little is understood about how the pathway is regulated. Such regulation is critical, as cells must respond rapidly to DNA damage while avoiding aberrant activation of repair proteins that can produce DNA damage as intermediates in the repair pathway. Indeed, overexpression of the human BER protein, NTHL1, a DNA N-glycosylase, can cause genomic instability and early cellular hallmarks of cancer. We developed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model to explore how overexpression of NTHL1 may impair cellular function. Overexpression of Ntg1, the budding yeast orthologue of NTHL1, impairs cell growth. To dissect mechanisms underlying this growth defect, we overexpressed either wild-type Ntg1 or a catalytically inactive variant of Ntg1 (ntg1catdead). Consistent with results obtained for NTHL1, both variants of Ntg1 impair cell growth, but only the wild-type protein causes accumulation of double-strand breaks and chromosome loss. We screened a panel of DNA repair mutants for resistance/sensitivity to overexpression of wild-type Ntg1 or ntg1catdead. This analysis identified several cellular pathways that protect cells from Ntg1-induced damage, providing insight into interplay between DNA repair pathways. Finally, we identified a link to sumoylation and probed how this post-translational modification could contribute to regulation of Ntg1 function. This study describes a budding yeast system to understand how cells regulate and respond to dysregulation of the BER pathway.\n\nTake AwayO_LIOverexpression of a base excision DNA repair protein impairs cell growth\nC_LIO_LIOverexpression of a base excision DNA repair protein can cause DNA damage\nC_LIO_LIMultiple mechanisms cause DNA damage from overexpression of a repair protein\nC_LIO_LIDNA repair pathways functionally interact to protect cells from DNA damage\nC_LIO_LIPrecise regulation of the activity of DNA repair proteins is critical\nC_LI",

Hyperinsulinemia, common in the obese state, has been associated with higher risk of death and recurrence in BC. Up to 80% of breast cancers overexpress the insulin receptor (INSR), which correlates with worse prognosis. To directly probe the role of insulin signaling in mammary tumorigenesis, we generated the MMTV-driven polyoma middle T (PyMT) and ErbB2/Her2 BC mouse models, respectively, with coordinate mammary epithelium restricted deletion of the INSR. In both models, deletion of either one or both copies of the INSR in the mammary gland led to a marked delay in tumor onset and burden, including in mice fed to mimic conditions of human obesity. Phenotypic characterization and longitudinal monitoring of mouse tumours, and ex vivo analysis of mammary cells from the generated mouse models revealed that tumor initiation, rather than progression and metastasis, were impacted by INSR deletion. Mechanistically, INSR deficiency in non-transformed mammary epithelial cells led to diminished bioenergetic fitness. The similarity of phenotypes elicited by the deletion of one or both copies of INSR indicates that there is a dose-dependent threshold for the contribution of INSR to mammary tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "The roles of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in plant-fungal pathogenic interactions are less understood in crops. Here, microscopic, phenotyping, proteomic and biochemical analyses revealed that independent TALEN-based knockout lines of Hordeum vulgare MITOGEN-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3 (HvMPK3 KO) were resistant against Fusarium graminearum infection. When co-cultured with roots of the HvMPK3 KO lines, F. graminearum hyphae were excluded to the extracellular space, the growth pattern of hyphae was considerably deregulated, mycelia development was less efficient and number of appressoria and their penetration potential were significantly reduced. Intracellular penetration of hyphae was preceded by the massive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in attacked cells of the wild type, but it was mitigated in the HvMPK3 KO lines. Suppression of ROS production in these lines coincided with the elevated abundances of catalase and ascorbate peroxidase. Moreover, differential proteomic analysis revealed downregulation of defense-related proteins in wild type, and the upregulation of peroxidases, lipid transfer proteins, and cysteine proteases in HvMPK3 KO lines after 24h of F. graminearum inoculation. Consistently with proteomic analysis, microscopic observations showed an enhanced suberin accumulation in roots of HvMPK3 KO lines, most likely contributing to the arrested infection by F. graminearum. These results suggest that TALEN-based knockout of HvMPK3 leads to the barley root resistance against Fusarium root rot.",

Whilst many immunological studies have revealed fundamental insights into SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19, mathematical and computational modelling can offer an additional perspective and enhance understanding. The majority of mathematical models for the within-host spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection are ordinary differential equations, which neglect spatial variation. In this article, we present a hybrid, multiscale, individual-based model to study the within-host spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The model incorporates epithelial cells (each containing a dynamical model for viral entry and replication), macrophages and a subset of cytokines. We investigate the role of increasing initial viral deposition, increasing delay in type I interferon secretion from epithelial cells (as well as the magnitude of secretion), increasing macrophage virus internalisation rate and macrophage activation, on the spread of infection.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHistology remains the gold standard to assess human brain biology, so ex vivo studies using tissue from brain banks are standard practice in neuroscientific research. However, a larger number of specimens could be obtained from gross anatomy laboratories. These specimens are fixed with solutions appropriate for dissections, but whether they also preserve brain tissue antigenicity is unclear. Therefore, we perfused mice brains with solutions used for human body preservation to assess and compare the tissue quality and antigenicity of the main cell populations.\n\nMethods28 C57BL/6J mice were perfused with: 4% formaldehyde (FAS, N=9), salt-saturated solution (SSS, N=9), and alcohol-solution (AS, N=10). The brains were cut into 40m sections for antigenicity analysis and were assessed by immunohistochemistry of four antigens: neuronal nuclei (NeuN), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP-astrocytes), ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule1 (Iba1-microglia), and myelin proteolipid protein (PLP). We compared the fixatives according to multiple variables: perfusion quality, ease of manipulation, tissue quality, immunohistochemistry quality, and antigenicity preservation.\n\nResultsThe perfusion quality was better using FAS and worse using AS. The manipulation was very poor in SSS brains. FAS and AS fixed brains showed higher tissue and immunohistochemistry quality than the SSS brains. All antigens were readily observed in every specimen, regardless of the fixative solution.\n\nConclusionSolutions designed to preserve specimens for human gross anatomy dissections also preserve tissue antigenicity in different brain cells. This offers opportunities for the use of human brains fixed in gross anatomy laboratories to assess normal or pathological conditions.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTNeuroscientists currently obtain tissue samples from brain banks. Alternatively, a much larger amount of tissue may be obtained from bodies donated to gross anatomy laboratories. However, they are preserved with different fixative solutions that are used for dissection purposes. We ignore if these solutions also preserve antigenicity of the main cell populations, essential in neuroscientific research. This work is the first to show that two solutions currently used in human gross anatomy laboratories preserve sufficient histological quality, in addition to preserve antigenicity of the main cell populations of the mice brain. This work opens the door to the use of human brain tissue obtained from anatomy laboratories in neuroscientific research.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was declared a pandemic. The virus has infected more than 505 million people and caused more than 6 million deaths. However, data on non-responders to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the general population are limited. The objective of the study is to comprehensively compare the immunological characteristics of non-responders to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the 18-59 years with that in the 60 years and older using internationally recognized cutoff values. Participants included 627 individuals who received physical examinations and volunteered to participate in COVID-19 vaccination from the general population. The main outcome was an effective seroconversion characterized by anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG level of at least 4-fold increase from baseline. Profiling of naive immune cells was analyzed prior to vaccination to demonstrate baseline immunity. Outcomes of effective seroconversion in the 18-59 years with that in the 60 years and older were compared. The quantitative level of the anti-spike IgG was significantly lower in the 60 years and older and in men among the 18-59 years. There were 7.5% of non-responders among the 18-59 years and 11.7% of non-responders in the 60 years and older using the 4-fold increase parameter. The effective seroconversion rate was significantly related to the level of certain immune cells before vaccination, such as CD4 cells, CD8 cells and B cells and the age. An individual with a titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG that is below 50 BAU/mL might be considered a non-responder between 14-90 days after the last vaccine dose. Booster vaccination or additional protective measures should be recommended for non-responders as soon as possible to reduce disease severity and mortality.",

    "abstract": "Evasion and antagonism of host cellular immunity upon SARS-CoV-2 infection confers a profound replication advantage on the virus and contributes to COVID-19 pathogenesis. We explored the ability of different SARS-CoV-2 proteins to antagonize the host innate immune system and found that the ORF6 protein mitigated type-I IFN (interferon) induction and downstream IFN signaling. Our findings also corroborated previous reports that ORF6 blocks the nuclear import of IRF3 and STAT1 to inhibit IFN induction and signaling. Here we show that ORF6 directly interacts with RIG-I and blocks downstream type-I IFN induction and signaling by inhibiting K-63 linked ubiquitination of RIG-I by the E3 Ligase TRIM25. This involves ORF6-mediated targeting of TRIM25 for degradation, also observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection. The type-I IFN antagonistic activity of ORF6 was mapped to its C-terminal cytoplasmic tail, specifically to amino acid residues 52-61. Overall, we provide new insights into how the SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 protein inhibits type I-IFN induction and signaling through distinct mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Methods that enable rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 provide valuable tools for detecting and controlling Covid-19 outbreaks and also facilitate more effective treatment of infected individuals. The predominant approaches developed use PCR to detect viral nucleic acids or immunoassays to detect viral proteins. Each approach has distinct advantages and disadvantages, but alternatives that do not share the same limitations could enable substantial improvements in outbreak detection and management. For instance, methods that have comparable sensitivity to PCR, but that are not prone to the false-positive results that stem from the tendency of PCR to detect molecular degradation products could improve accurate identification of infected individuals. An alternative approach with potential to achieve this entails harnessing the unique enzymatic properties of SARS-CoV-2 enzymes to generate SARS-Cov-2-specific signals that indicate the presence of the virus. This route benefits from the high sensitivity provided by enzymatic signal amplification and also the fact that signal is generated only by intact viral enzymes, not degradation products. Here, we demonstrate enzymatic reaction conditions that enable the preferential detection of NendoU of SARS-CoV-2, versus several of its orthologues, with a fluorogenic oligonucleotide substrate. These compositions provide a possible technical foundation for a novel approach for detecting SARS-CoV-2 that has distinct advantages from current approaches.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNotch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that dictates cell fate decisions in mammalian cells including megakaryocytes. Existence of functional Notch signaling in enucleate platelets that are generated as cytoplasmic buds from megakaryocytes still remains elusive.\n\nMethodsPlatelets were isolated from human blood by differential centrifugation under informed consent. Expression of transcripts as well as peptides of Notch1 and DLL-4 in platelets was studied by employing RT-qPCR, Western analysis and flow cytometry. Platelet activation responses that include aggregation, secretion of granule contents and platelet-leucocyte interaction were analyzed by Borns aggregometry, flow cytometry, Western analysis and lumi- aggregometry. Shedding of extracellular vesicles from platelets was documented with Nanoparticle Tracking Analyzer. Platelet adhesion and thrombus growth on immobilized matrix was quantified by employing microfluidics platform. Intracellular free calcium in Fura-2-loaded platelets was monitored from ratiometric fluorescence spectrophotometry. Coagulation parameters in whole blood were studied by thromboelastography. Ferric chloride-induced mesenteric arteriolar thrombosis in murine model was imaged by intravital microscopy.\n\nResultsHere we demonstrate significant expression of Notch1 and its ligand, the Delta-like ligand (DLL)- 4, as well as their respective transcripts, in human platelets. Synthesis and surface translocation of Notch1 and DLL-4 were upregulated when cells were challenged with physiological agonists like thrombin. DLL-4, in turn, instigated neighbouring platelets to switch to  activated phenotype, associated with cleavage of Notch receptor and generation of its intracellular domain (NICD). DLL-4-mediated pro-thrombotic attributes were averted by pharmacological inhibition of {gamma}-secretase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. Inhibition of Notch signaling, too, restrained agonist-induced platelet activation, and significantly impaired arterial thrombosis in mice, suggestive of synergism between thrombin- and DLL-4-mediated pathways. Strikingly, prevention of DLL-4-Notch1 interaction by a blocking antibody abolished platelet aggregation and extracellular vesicle shedding induced by thrombin.\n\nConclusionsOur study presents compelling evidence in support of non-canonical Notch signaling that propagates in juxtacrine manner within platelet aggregates and synergizes with physiological agonists to generate occlusive intramural thrombi. Thus, targeting Notch signaling can be investigated as a potential anti-platelet/anti-thrombotic therapeutic approach.\n\nFundingThis research was supported by J. C.

This disease is characterized by a sequence of low and high-grade preinvasive stages with increasing probability of malignant progression. Increasing our knowledge about the biology of these premalignant lesions (PMLs) is necessary to design new methods of early detection and prevention, and to identify the molecular processes that are key for malignant progression. To facilitate this research, we have designed XTABLE, an open-source application that integrates the most extensive transcriptomic databases of PMLs published so far. With this tool, users can stratify samples using multiple parameters and interrogate PML biology in multiple manners, such as two and multiple group comparisons, interrogation of genes of interests and transcriptional signatures. Using XTABLE, we have carried out a comparative study of the potential role of chromosomal instability scores as biomarkers of PML progression and mapped the onset of the most relevant LUSC pathways to the sequence of LUSC developmental stages. XTABLE will critically facilitate new research for the identification of early detection biomarkers and acquire a better understanding of the LUSC precancerous stages.",

    "abstract": "The rising incidence of pancreatic cancer is largely driven by the skyrocketing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Hyperinsulinemia is a cardinal feature of both conditions, and is independently associated with increased cancer incidence and mortality. Our previous studies demonstrated that genetically reducing insulin production suppressed formation of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) pre-cancerous lesions in mice with mutant Kras. However, we found that hyperinsulinemia affected many cell types in the pancreatic microenvironment. Thus, it remained unclear whether hyperinsulinemia exerted its effects directly on the cells that give rise to PanINs or indirectly. The molecular mechanisms involved were unknown. Here, we tested whether insulin receptors (Insr) in KrasG12D-expressing pancreatic acinar cells are necessary for the effects of hyperinsulinemia on obesity-associated pancreatic cancer development. Loss of Insr in KrasG12D-expressing acinar cells did not prevent hyperinsulinemia or weight gain associated with high fat diet consumption in mice. However, solely reducing Insr in KrasG12D-expressing acinar cells significantly reduced formation of PanIN and tumors, in a gene dose-dependent manner. Mechanistically, proteomic analyses showed that hyperinsulinemia acts through Insr to drive the excess production of digestive enzymes in acinar cells by modulating the activity of the spliceosome, ribosome, and secretory machinery. This increased local inflammation was abrogated by acinar-specific Insr knockout. We confirmed that insulin increased the conversion of wild-type acinar cells into acinar-to-ductal metaplasia in a trypsin- and Insr-dependent manner. Collectively, these data demonstrate that hyperinsulinemia acting via acinar cells insulin receptors promotes inflammatory conditions that cooperate with Kras signaling to increase the risk of developing pancreatic cancer, mechanistically linking obesity and pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "Seedling vigor is a key agronomic trait that determines juvenile plant performance. Angiosperm seeds develop inside fruits and are connected to the mother plant through vascular tissues. Their formation requires plant-specific genes, such as BREVIS RADIX (BRX) in Arabidopsis thaliana roots. BRX family proteins are found throughout the angiosperms but also occur in non-vascular bryophytes and non-seed lycophytes. They consist of four conserved domains, including the tandem \"BRX-domains\". We found that bryophyte or lycophyte BRX homologs can only partially substitute for Arabidopsis BRX (AtBRX) because they miss key features in the linker between the BRX-domains. Intriguingly however, expression of a BRX homolog from the lycophyte Selaginella moellendorffii (SmBRX) in A. thaliana wildtype background confers robustly enhanced root growth vigor that persists throughout the life cycle. This effect can be traced back to a substantial increase in seed and embryo size, and can be reproduced with a modified, \"SmBRX-like\" variant of AtBRX. Our results thus suggest that BRX variants could serve as biotechnological tools to boost seedling vigor and shed light on the activity of ancient, non-angiosperm BRX family proteins.",

    "abstract": "Presenting information in papers allows readers to see the evidence for the research claims. The amount of information presented to readers is increasing in high impact factor scientific journals. The aim of the present study was to determine whether there was a similar expansion in the amount of information presented to readers in subject-specific journals. We examined 878 research papers that were published in the journals Biology of Reproduction and Reproduction during the first six months of 1989, 1999, 2009, and 2019. Although there were few differences between the journals, we found that between 1989 and 2019 the number of figures increased 1.5-fold, the number of figure panels increased 3.6-fold, and the number of display items increased 5.6-fold. Amongst the display items, the number of images per paper increased 10-fold, and the number of graphs per paper increased 3.7-fold. The median paper in 1989 was 8 pages long, contained 6 tables and/or figures, with 1 image and 4 graphs. In 2019 the median paper was 12 pages long, contained 7 tables and/or figures, with 13 images and 15 graphs. This expansion of information in subject-specific journals implies that authors, reviewers, and editors need to help readers digest complex biological messages without causing information overload.\n\nLay summaryWe are living in an age of science and information. The amount of information presented in research papers has increased over time in the top science journals. Our research examined whether there has been a similar expansion in information in two influential subject-specific journals. We counted how much information was presented in 878 research papers across a 30-year period in the journals Biology of Reproduction and Reproduction. There were few differences between the two journals. But there was a striking increase in the information presented to readers in 2019 compared with 1989. The typical paper in 1989 was 8 pages long and contained 1 picture and 4 graphs. In 2019 the typical paper was 12 pages long and contained 13 pictures and 15 graphs. This expansion of information means that subject-specific journals must balance the presentation of complex biological messages with the risk of causing information overload.",

    "abstract": "Since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, humans have been exposed to distinct SARS-CoV-2 antigens, either by infection with different variants, and/or vaccination. Population immunity is thus highly heterogeneous, but the impact of such heterogeneity on the effectiveness and breadth of the antibody-mediated response is unclear. We measured antibody-mediated neutralisation responses against SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2{delta} and SARS-CoV-2o pseudoviruses using sera from patients with distinct immunological histories, including naive, vaccinated, infected with SARS-CoV-2Wuhan, SARS-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV-2{delta}, and vaccinated/infected individuals. We show that the breadth and potency of the antibody-mediated response is influenced by the number, the variant, and the nature (infection or vaccination) of exposures, and that individuals with mixed immunity acquired by vaccination and natural exposure exhibit the broadest and most potent responses. Our results suggest that the interplay between host immunity and SARS-CoV-2 evolution will shape the antigenicity and subsequent transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for future vaccine design.\n\nAuthor SummaryNeutralising antibodies provide protection against viruses and are generated because of vaccination or prior infections. The main target of anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies is a protein called Spike, which decorates the viral particle and mediates viral entry into cells. As SARS-CoV-2 evolves, mutations accumulate in the spike protein, allowing the virus to escape antibody-mediated immunity and decreasing vaccine effectiveness. Multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants have appeared since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, causing various waves of infection through the population and infecting-in some cases-people that had been previously infected or vaccinated. Since the antibody response is highly specific, individuals infected with different variants are likely to have different repertoires of neutralising antibodies. We studied the breadth and potency of the antibody-mediated response against different SARS-CoV-2 variants using sera from vaccinated people as well as from people infected with different variants. We show that potency of the antibody response against different SARS-CoV-2 variants depends on the particular variant that infected each person, the exposure type (infection or vaccination) and the number and order of exposures. Our study provides insight into the interplay between virus evolution and immunity, as well as important information for the development of better vaccination strategies.",

    "abstract": "The molecular and functional heterogeneity of pancreatic {beta}-cells is well recognized. Pancreatic islets harbor a small subset of {beta}-cells that co-express Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), an enzyme involved in synthesis of catecholamines that repress insulin secretion. Restriction of this sub-population within islets is essential for appropriate insulin secretion. However, the distinguishing characteristics of this subpopulation and the mechanisms that restrict TH expression in {beta}-cells are not known. Here, we define the specific molecular and metabolic characteristics of the TH+ {beta}-cells and show that TH expression in {beta}-cells is restricted by DNA methylation patterning during {beta}-cell lineage specification. Ablation of de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a in the pancreatic- and endocrine-progenitor lineages results in a dramatic increase in the proportion of TH+ {beta}-cells, while {beta}-cell specific ablation of Dnmt3a has no effect on this sub-population. We demonstrate that maintenance of Th promoter DNA methylation patterns is essential for its continued restriction in postnatal {beta}-cells, and that loss of DNA methylation dysregulates TH expression in {beta}-cells in response to chronic overnutrition, contributing to impairment of {beta}-cell identity. These data highlight the essential requirement of DNA methylation patterning in regulating endocrine cell fates, and reveal a novel role of DNA methylation in {beta}-cell heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "The detection of various type of genomic variants and their accumulation processes during species diversification and adaptive radiation is important for understanding the molecular and genetic basis of evolution. Anolis lizards in the West Indies are good models for studying the mechanism of the evolution because of the repeated evolution of their morphology and the ecology. In this study, we performed de novo genome assembly of six Cuban Anolis lizards with different ecomorphs and thermal habitats (Anolis isolepis, Anolis allisoni, Anolis porcatus, Anolis allogus, Anolis homolechis, and Anolis sagrei). As a result, we obtained six novel draft genomes with relatively long and high gene completeness, with scaffold N50 ranging from 5.56-39.79 Mb, and vertebrate Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs completeness ranging from 77.5% to 86.9%. Subsequently, we performed comparative analysis of genomic contents including those of mainland Anolis lizards to estimate genetic variations that had emerged and accumulated during the diversification of Anolis lizards. Comparing the repeat element compositions and repeat landscapes revealed differences in the accumulation process between Cuban trunk-crown and trunk-ground species, LTR accumulation observed only in A. carolinensis, and separate expansions of several families of LINE in each of Cuban trunk-ground species. The analysis of duplicated genes suggested that the proportional difference of duplicated gene number among Cuban Anolis lizards may be associated to the difference of their habitat range. Furthermore, Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent analysis proposed that the effective population sizes of each species might have been affected by Cubas geohistory. Hence, these six novel draft genome assemblies and detected genetic variations can be a springboard for the further genetic elucidation of the Anolis lizards diversification.\n\nSignificanceAnolis lizard in the West Indies is excellent model for studying the mechanisms of speciation and adaptive evolution. Still, due to a lack of genome assemblies, genetic variations and accumulation process of them involved in the diversification remain largely unexplored. In this study, we reported the novel genome assemblies of six Cuban Anolis lizards and analyzed evolution of genome contents. From comparative genomic analysis and inferences of genetic variation accumulation process, we detected species- and lineage-specific transposon accumulation processes and gene copy number evolution, considered to be associated with the adaptation to their habitats. Additionally, we estimated past effective population sizes and the results suggested its relationship to Cubas geohistory.",

    "abstract": "Mechanotransduction at cell-cell adhesions is crucial for the structural integrity, organization, and morphogenesis of epithelia. At cell-cell junctions, ternary E-cadherin/{beta}-catenin/E-catenin complexes sense and transmit mechanical load by binding to F-actin. The interaction with F-actin, described as a two-state catch bond, is weak in solution but is strengthened by applied force due to force-dependent transitions between weak and strong actin-binding states. Here, we provide direct evidence from optical trapping experiments that the catch bond property principally resides in the E-catenin actin-binding domain (ABD). Consistent with our previously proposed model, deletion of the first helix of the five-helix ABD bundle enables stable interactions with F-actin under minimal load that are well-described by a single-state slip bond, even when E-catenin is complexed with {beta}-catenin and E-cadherin. Our data argue for a conserved catch bond mechanism for adhesion proteins with structurally similar ABDs. We also demonstrate that a stably bound ABD strengthens load-dependent binding interactions between a neighboring complex and F-actin, but the presence of the other E-catenin domains weakens this effect. These results provide mechanistic insight to the cooperative binding of the cadherin-catenin complex to F-actin, which regulate dynamic cytoskeletal linkages in epithelial tissues.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsMetastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) is lethal, yet a subset of patients who have metastatic disease that spreads only to the lung have better outcomes. We identified unique transcriptomic and immune features that distinguish patients who develop metastases in the liver (liver cohort) versus those with lung-avid but liver-averse mPDAC (lung cohort).\n\nMethodsWe used clinical data from the Oregon Pancreas Tissue Registry to identify PDAC patients with liver and/or lung metastases. Gene expression and genomic alteration data from 290 PDAC tumors were used to identify features unique to patients from the liver and lung cohorts. In parallel, T cell receptor sequencing data from 289 patients were used to identify immune features unique to patients in the lung cohort.\n\nResultsLung cohort patients had better survival outcomes than liver cohort patients. Primary tumors from patients in the liver cohort expressed a novel gene signature associated with ongoing replication stress (RS) response predictive of poor patient outcome independent from known subtypes. In contrast, patients with tumors lacking the RS response signature survived longer, especially if their tumors had alterations in DNA damage repair genes. A subset of patients in the lung cohort demonstrated new T cell clonal development in their primary and metastatic tumors leading to diverse peripheral blood TCR repertoires.\n\nConclusionLiver-avid metastatic PDAC is associated with an ongoing RS response, whereas tumors lacking the RS response with ongoing T cell clonal responses may have unique vulnerabilities allowing long-term survival in patients with lung-avid, liver-averse metastatic PDAC.",

    "abstract": "It is unclear how gene order within the chromosome influences bacterial evolution. The genomic location of genes encoding the flow of genetic information is biased towards the replication origin (oriC) in fast-growing bacteria. To study the role of chromosomal location on cell physiology we relocated the S10-spec- locus (S10), harboring half of ribosomal protein genes, to different chromosomal positions in the fast-growing pathogen V. cholerae. We found that growth rate, fitness and infectivity inversely correlated the distance between S10 and oriC. To gain insight into the evolutionary effect of ribosomal protein genomic position, we evolved strains bearing S10 at its current oriC-proximal location or derivatives where the locus far from it, at the chromosomal termini. All populations increased their growth rate along the experiment regardless S10 genomic location. However, the growth rate advantage of an oriC-proximal location persisted along experimental evolution indicating that suppressor mutations cannot compensate S10 genomic position. An increment in biofilm forming capacity was another common trait observed along the experiment. Deep sequencing of populations showed on average 1 mutation fixed each 100 generations, mainly at genes linked to flagellum biosynthesis regulation, lipopolysaccharide synthesis, chemotaxis, biofilm and quorum sensing. We selected fast-growing clones displaying a [~]10% growth rate increment. We found that they harbored inactivating mutations at, among other sites, the flagellum master regulators flrAB. The introduction of these mutations into naive V. cholerae strains resulted in a [~]10% increase of growth rate. Our study therefore demonstrates that the location of ribosomal protein genes conditions the evolutionary trajectory of growth rate in the long term. While genomic content is highly plastic in prokaryotes, gene order is an underestimated factor that conditions cellular physiology and lineage evolution. The lack of suppression enables artificial gene relocation for genetic circuit reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "HypothesisDysbiosis of the intestinal microflora has been reported in stress-induced depression and irritable colitis, a similar abnormality may also occur in stress-triggered Menieres disease.\n\nBackgroundMenieres disease is an intractable disease characterized by paroxysms of intense rotatory dizziness, hearing loss, and other auditory symptoms. It is believed to be caused by endolymphatic hydrops of the vestibule and cochlea. The diagnosis of Menieres disease is based on the diagnostic criteria established by the Barany Society and AAO-HNS and Journal of Vestibular Research as definite or probable cases. Endolymphatic hydrops identification using cochlear contrast-enhanced MRI (hybrid of reversed image of positive endolymph signal and native image of positive perilymph signal [HYDROPS]) is an objective test for Menieres disease, enabling reliable diagnosis of this disease.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the gut microbiota of 10 patients (6 males and 4 females, mean age 49.6 {+/-} 8.1 years) who met the diagnostic criteria for a unilateral definite case of Menieres disease using the diagnostic criteria of the Journal of Vestibular Research, and who also had significant endolymphatic hydrops on the affected side on HYDROPS. Intestinal microbiota tests were performed on these 10 patients and the results were evaluated in relation to the duration of disease, results of audiometry of the affected side, and DHI (Dizziness Handicap Inventory) score.\n\nResultsA significant negative correlation was found between the disease duration and Shannon diversity index and Faiths phylogenetic diversity, which indicated dysbiosis of the intestinal microflora. No correlation was found between the indicators of microbial diversity and the results of audiometry or the DHI on the affected side. Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota worsened with increasing duration of Menieres disease. Moreover, Akkermansia muciniphila was not detected in any patient with Menieres disease.\n\nConclusions.Despite the small number of cases in this study (n = 10), the findings indicate the possibility of abnormalities of the intestinal microflora in Menieres disease.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti mosquito eggs can remain quiescent for many months before hatching, allowing populations to persist through unfavorable conditions. Aedes aegypti infected with the Wolbachia strain wMel have been released in tropical and subtropical regions for dengue control. wMel reduces the viability of quiescent eggs, but this physiological cost might be expected to evolve in natural mosquito populations that frequently experience stressful conditions. We therefore compared the costs of wMel infection for quiescent egg viability in field-derived and laboratory populations. Quiescent egg viability was highly variable in wMel-infected populations, with greater costs of wMel in field-derived populations. In contrast, there was little variation between matched field-derived and long-term laboratory populations lacking wMel, suggesting that laboratory adaptation does not influence this trait and that differences are due to wMel infection. Comparisons of populations collected a year apart show a decline in costs under laboratory rearing conditions involving a rapid turnover of mosquito generations; this pattern was consistent across populations despite their origin, suggesting adaptation of mosquitoes to the wMel infection under laboratory conditions. Reciprocal crossing experiments confirm that differences in quiescent egg viability were mainly due to the genetic background and not Wolbachia alone. wMel-infected mosquitoes hatching from long-term quiescent eggs showed partial loss of cytoplasmic incompatibility and female infertility, highlighting additional costs of long-term quiescence. Our study provides the first evidence for a shift in Wolbachia phenotypic effects following deliberate field release and establishment and it highlights interactions between Wolbachia infections and local adaptation. The unexpected changes in fitness costs observed here suggest potential tradeoffs with undescribed fitness benefits of the wMel infection.",

Despite the profound socioeconomic impacts of hearing disorders and the fundamental biological significance of understanding MT, the composition, structure and mechanism of the MT complex has remained elusive. Here we report the single particle cryo-EM structure of the native MT TMC-1 complex isolated from C. elegans. The 2-fold symmetric complex is composed of 2 copies each of the pore-forming TMC-1 subunit, the calcium-binding protein CALM-1 and the transmembrane inner ear protein TMIE. CALM-1 makes extensive contacts with the cytoplasmic face of the TMC-1 subunits while the single-pass TMIE subunits reside on the periphery of the complex, poised like the handles of an accordion. A subset of particles in addition harbors a single arrestin-like protein, ARRD-6, bound to a CALM-1 domain. Single- particle reconstructions and molecular dynamics simulations show how the MT complex deforms the membrane bilayer and suggest crucial roles for lipid-protein interactions in the mechanism by which mechanical force is transduced to ion channel gating.",

Over 6.76 {middle dot} 108 read fragments were assigned to ARGs and 3.21 {middle dot} 109 to rRNA genes, where we observed distinct differences in both the abundance of ARGs and the link between microbiome and resistome compositions across various sampling types.

Nintedanib increased caspase-3 activity in the presence of Fas Ligand (FasL) in normal but not in IPF senescent fibroblasts. Conversely, nintedanib enhanced B cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 expression in senescent IPF lung fibroblasts. Moreover, in senescent IPF cells, pirfenidone alone induced mixed lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL) phosphorylation, provoking necroptosis. However, fragmented gasdermin D, indicating pyroptosis, was not detected under any condition. In addition, SOC drugs increased transcript levels of fibrotic and senescence markers in senescent IPF fibroblasts, whereas D+Q inhibited all these markers. Finally, D+Q enhanced growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15) transcript and protein levels in both normal and IPF senescent fibroblasts.\n\nConclusionsIn the presence and absence of the extrinsic pro-apoptotic ligands, SOC drugs failed to trigger apoptosis in senescent fibroblasts, possibly due to enhanced Bcl-2 levels and the activation of the necroptosis pathway. SOC drugs elevated fibrotic and senescence markers in IPF lung fibroblasts. Together, these data demonstrated the inefficacy of SOC in targeting senescent cells. Further investigation is required to fully elucidate the therapeutic implications of SOC drugs on other senescent cell types in IPF.",

Type 1 diabetes and a total lack of insulin are associated with increased risk of ALS.

Hexameric Cx31 and hexameric Cx43 have hemichannels composed of 6 subunits that work as transmembrane channels, binding together to form gap junction intercellular channels that open and close. We used the program AutoDock Vina Extended for the molecular docking study.\n\nResultsCx31 shares amino acid and structural similarity to Cx43 and insulin docks to the same position of the N-terminal domain of monomeric Cx31 and monomeric Cx43. Insulin docks within the open hemichannel of hexameric Cx31, potentially blocking it. The block may be responsible for the protective relationship of T2D to ALS.\n\nConclusionInsulin, especially intranasal insulin, might be a treatment for ALS.

Little is known about discrete cell types and molecular mechanisms in PTOA synovium. We aimed to describe synovial cell populations and their dynamics in PTOA, with a focus on fibroblasts. We also sought to define mechanisms of synovial Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, given its emerging importance in arthritis.\n\nMethodsWe subjected mice to non-invasive anterior cruciate ligament rupture as a model of human joint injury. We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing to assess synovial cell populations, subjected Wnt-GFP reporter mice to joint injury to study Wnt-active cells, and performed intra-articular injections of the Wnt agonist R-spondin 2 (Rspo2) to assess whether gain-of-function induced pathologies characteristic of PTOA. Lastly, we used cultured fibroblasts, macrophages, and chondrocytes to study how Rspo2 orchestrates crosstalk between joint cell types.\n\nResultsWe uncovered seven distinct functional subsets of synovial fibroblasts in healthy and injured synovium, and defined their temporal dynamics in early and established PTOA. Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling was overactive in PTOA synovium, and Rspo2 was strongly induced after injury and secreted exclusively by Prg4hi lining fibroblasts. Trajectory analyses predicted that Prg4hi lining fibroblasts arise from a pool of Dpp4+ mesenchymal progenitors in synovium, with SOX5 identified as a potential regulator of this emergence. We also showed that Rspo2 orchestrated pathological crosstalk between synovial fibroblasts, macrophages, and chondrocytes.\n\nConclusionsSynovial fibroblasts assume distinct functional identities during PTOA, and Prg4hi lining fibroblasts secrete the Wnt agonist Rspo2 to drive pathological crosstalk in the joint after injury.",

    "abstract": "Enzyme-mediated chemical modifications to mRNA are important for fine-tuning gene expression, but they are challenging to quantify due to low copy number and limited tools for accurate detection. Existing studies have typically focused on the identification and impact of adenine modifications on mRNA (m6A and inosine) due to the availability of analytical methods. The pseudouridine ({Psi}) mRNA modification is also highly abundant but difficult to detect and quantify because there is no available antibody, it is mass silent, and maintains canonical basepairing with adenine. Nanopores may be used to directly identify {Psi} sites in RNAs using a systematically miscalled base, however, this approach is not quantitative and highly sequence dependent. In this work, we apply supervised machine learning models that are trained on sequence-specific, synthetic controls to endogenous transcriptome data and achieve the first quantitative {Psi} occupancy measurement in human mRNAs. Our supervised machine learning models reveal that for every site studied, different signal parameters are required to maximize {Psi} classification accuracy. We show that applying our model is critical for quantification, especially in low-abundance mRNAs. Our engine can be used to profile {Psi}-occupancy across cell types and cell states, thus providing critical insights about physiological relevance of {Psi} modification to mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) protein structures reveal the fundamental information about protein function. The state-of-art protein structure prediction methods such as Alphafold are being widely used to predict structures of uncharacterized proteins in biomedical research. There is a significant need to further improve the quality and nativeness of the predicted structures to enhance their usability. Current machine learning methods of refining protein structures focus mostly on improving the backbone quality of predicted structures without effectively leveraging and enhancing the conformation of all atoms including side-chain, while molecular simulation methods are computationally intensive and time-consuming.\n\nIn this work, we develop ATOMRefine, a deep learning-based, end-to-end, all-atom protein structural model refinement method. It uses a SE(3)-equivariant graph transformer network that is equivariant to the rotation and translation of 3D structures in conjunction with a novel graph representation of all atoms to directly refine protein atomic coordinates of all the atoms in a predicted tertiary structure represented as a molecular graph. The method is first trained and tested on the structural models in AlphafoldDB whose experimental structures are known, and then blindly tested on 69 CASP14 regular targets and 7 CASP14 refinement targets. ATOMRefine improves the quality of both backbone atoms and all-atom conformation of the initial structural models generated by AlphaFold. It also performs better than the state-of-the-art refinement methods in multiple evaluation metrics including an all-atom model quality score - the MolProbity score based on the analysis of all-atom contacts, bond length, atom clashes, torsion angles, and side-chain rotamers. As ATOMRefine can refine a protein structure quickly, it provides a viable, fast solution for improving protein geometry and fixing structural errors of predicted structures through direct coordinate refinement.",

    "abstract": "1.BackgroundDetermining the life-history traits of extinct species is often difficult from skeletal remains alone, limiting the accuracy of studies modeling past ecosystems. However, the analysis of the degraded endogenous bacterial DNA present in paleontological fecal matter (coprolites) may enable the characterization of specific traits such as the hosts digestive physiology and diet. An issue when evaluating the microbial composition of coprolites is the degree to which the microbiome is representative of the hosts original gut community versus the changes that occur in the weeks following deposition due to desiccation. Analyses of paleontological microorganisms are also relevant in the light of recent studies linking the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene extinctions with modern-day zoonotic pathogen outbreaks.\n\nMethodsShotgun sequencing was performed on ancient DNA (aDNA) extracted from coprolites of the Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus Columbi), Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotheriops shastensis) and paleontological bison (Bison sp.) collected from caves on the Colorado Plateau, Southwestern USA. The novel metagenomic classifier MTSv, parameterized for studies of aDNA, was used to assign bacterial taxa to sequencing reads. The resulting bacterial community of coprolites was then compared to those from modern fecal specimens of the African savannah elephant (Loxodonta africana), the brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus) and the modern bison (Bison bison). Both paleontological and modern bison fecal bacterial communities were also compared to those of progressively dried cattle feces to determine whether endogenous DNA from coprolites had a microbiome signal skewed towards aerobic microorganisms typical of desiccated fecal matter.\n\nResultsThe diversity of phyla identified from coprolites was lower than modern specimens. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria was increased in coprolites compared to modern specimens, with fewer Bacteroidetes and Euryarchaeota. Firmicutes had a reduced relative abundance in the mammoth and bison coprolites, compared to the African savanna elephants and modern bison. There was a significant separation of samples in NMDS plots based on their classification as either paleontological or modern, and to a lesser extent, based on the host species. Increasingly dried cattle feces formed a continuum between the modern and paleontological bison samples.\n\nConclusionOur results reveal that any coprolite metagenomes should always be compared to desiccated modern fecal samples from closely related hosts fed a comparable diet to determine the degree to which the coprolite metagenome is a result of desiccation versus true dissimilarities between the modern and paleontological hosts. Also, a large-scale desiccation study including a variety of modern species may shed light on life-history traits of extinct species without close extant relatives, by establishing the proximity of coprolite metagenomes with those from dried modern samples.",

    "abstract": "Critical sized cartilage defects heal poorly and MSC-based therapies holds promise functional cartilage regeneration either used alone or in combination with growth factors. However, Recombinant protein growth factors were proven to have minimal benefits while to have adverse side effects and high cost. Nonviral mRNA delivery provides a promising, alternative approach to delivering therapeutic proteins within defect lesion for an extended period of time. Despite successful therapeutic outcome in bone and other vascularized tissues, the therapeutic application of mRNA in poorly vascularized tissues such as cartilage is still facing many challenges and rarely studied. We report here using chemically modified messenger RNA encoding TGF-{beta}3(TGF-{beta}3 cmRNA) to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of BMSCs to efficient repair of cartilage defect. Local administration of TGF-{beta}3 cmRNA enhanced BMSCs therapy restored critical-sized cartilage defects in situ in a rat model within 6 weeks with structural and molecular markers similar to its nature counterparts. In addition, the development of osteoarthritis caused by cartilage damage was prevented by this mRNA-enhanced BMSCs therapy evidenced by minimal late-stage OA pharmacological presentations. This novel mRNA enhanced-MSC technology extend the development of new therapeutic approaches for treating functional cartilage repair.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic interventions for intervertebral disc herniation remain scarce due to the inability of endogenous annulus fibrosus (AF) cells to respond to injury and drive tissue regeneration. Unlike other orthopaedic tissues, such as cartilage, delivery of exogenous cells to the site of annular injury remains underdeveloped, largely due to a lack of an ideal cell source and the invasive nature of cell isolation. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be differentiated to specific cell fates using biochemical factors and are, therefore, an invaluable tool for cell therapy approaches. While differentiation protocols have been developed for cartilage and fibrous connective tissues (e.g., tendon), the signals that regulate the induction and differentiation of human iPSCs towards the annulus fibrosus fate remain unknown. Here, we screened a number of candidate factors (and their combinations) and assessed the transcriptomic signatures of key signaling factors involved in embryonic AF development and differentiated function. The transcriptional signatures of treated cells were compared to those of mature human AF cells, and conditions that promoted expression of annulus fibrosus extracellular matrix genes and key transcription factors involved in embryonic AF development were identified. These findings represent an initial approach to guide human induced pluripotent stem cells towards an annulus fibrosus-like fate for cellular delivery strategies.",

    "abstract": "Tau tubulin kinase 1 and 2 (TTBK1 and TTBK2) are highly homologous kinases that are expressed and mediate disease-relevant pathways predominantly in the brain. Distinct roles for TTBK1 and TTBK2 have been delineated. While efforts have been devoted to characterizing the impact to TTBK1 inhibition in diseases like Alzheimers disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, TTBK2 inhibition has been less explored. TTBK2 serves a critical function during cilia assembly. Given the biological importance of these kinases, we designed a targeted library from which we identified several chemical tools that engage TTBK1 and TTBK2 in cells and inhibit their downstream signaling. Indolyl pyrimidinamine 10 significantly reduced the expression of primary cilia on the surface of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Furthermore, analog 10 phenocopies TTBK2 KO in iPSCs, confirming an essential role for TTBK2 in ciliogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling is an essential driver of embryonic patterning that, when corrupted, leads to developmental disorders and cancers. SHH effector responses are organized through nonmotile primary cilia that grow and retract with the cell cycle and in response to distinct extracellular cues. Destabilization of primary cilium length corrupts SHH pathway regulation, which places significant pressure on SHH to maintain ciliary architecture. Herein, we investigate whether SHH signaling promotes ciliary length control. We reveal a signal crosstalk circuit induced by SHH activation of Phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) that drives ciliary EP4 signaling to stabilize primary cilium length. We demonstrate that chemical or genetic blockade of SHH-EP4 crosstalk leads to destabilized primary cilium cyclic AMP (cAMP) control, reduced ciliary length, and attenuated SHH pathway induction. Accordingly, we find that Ep -/- mice display shortened neuroepithelial primary cilia and altered SHH-dependent neuronal cell fate specification. Thus, SHH initiates a signaling crosstalk circuit that maintains primary cilium length for a robust downstream signaling response.",

    "abstract": "The eye lens is responsible for focusing and transmitting light to the retina. The lens does this in the absence of organelles yet maintains transparency for at least five decades before onset of age-related nuclear cataract (ARNC). It is hypothesized that oxidative stress contributes significantly to ARNC formation. It is additionally hypothesized that transparency is maintained by a microcirculation system (MCS) that delivers antioxidants to the lens nucleus and exports small molecule waste. Common data-ependent acquisition (DDA) methods are hindered by dynamic range of lens protein expression and provide limited context to age-related changes in the lens. In this study we utilized data-independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry to analyze the urea insoluble, membrane protein fractions of 16 human lenses subdivided into three spatially distinct lens regions to characterize age-related changes, particularly concerning the lens MCS and oxidative stress response. In this pilot cohort, we measured 4,788 distinct protein groups, 46,681 peptides, and 7,592 deamidated sequences, more than in any previous human lens DDA approach. Our results reveal age-related changes previously known in lens biology and expand on these findings, taking advantage of the rich dataset afforded by DIA. Principally, we demonstrate that a significant proteome remodeling event occurs at approximately 50 years of age, resulting in metabolic preference for anaerobic glycolysis established with organelle degradation, decreased abundance of protein networks involved in calcium-dependent cell-cell contacts while retaining networks related to oxidative stress response. Further, we identified multiple antioxidant transporter proteins not previously detected in the human lens and describe their spatiotemporal and age-related abundance changes. Finally, we demonstrate that aquaporin-5, among other proteins, is modified with age by PTMs including deamidation and truncation. We suggest that the continued accumulation of each of these age-related outcomes in proteome remodeling contribute to decreased fiber cell permeability and result in ARNC formation.",

    "abstract": "In the past decade, defective DNA repair has been increasingly linked with cancer progression. Human tumors with markers of defective DNA repair and increased replication stress have been shown to exhibit genomic instability and poor survival rates across tumor types. Here we utilize-omics data from two independent consortia to identify the genetic underpinnings of replication stress, therapy resistance, and primary carcinoma to brain metastasis in BRCA wildtype tumors. In doing so, we have defined a new pan-cancer class of tumors characterized by replicative instability (RIN). RIN is defined by genomic evolution secondary to replicative challenge. Our data supports a model whereby defective single-strand break repair, translesion synthesis, and non-homologous end joining effectors drive RIN. Collectively, we find that RIN accelerates cancer progression by driving copy number alterations and transcriptional program rewiring that promote tumor evolution.\n\nStatement of SignificanceDefining the genetic basis of genomic instability with wildtype BRCA repair effectors is a significant unmet need in cancer research. Here we identify and characterize a pan-cancer cohort of tumors driven by replicative instability (RIN). We find that RIN drives therapy resistance and distant metastases across multiple tumor types.",
