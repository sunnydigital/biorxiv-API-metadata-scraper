    "abstract": "We study the evolution of altruistic behavior under a model where individuals choose to cooperate by comparing a set of continuous phenotype tags. Individuals play a donation game and only donate to other individuals that are sufficiently similar to themselves in a multidimensional phenotype space. We find the generic maintenance of robust altruism when phenotypes are multidimensional. Selection for altruism is driven by the coevolution of individual strategy and phenotype; altruism levels shape the distribution of individuals in phenotype space. Low donation rates induce a phenotype distribution that renders the population vulnerable to the invasion of altruists, whereas high donation rates prime a population for cheater invasion, resulting in cyclic dynamics that maintain substantial levels of altruism. Altruism is therefore robust to invasion by cheaters in the long term in this model. Furthermore, the shape of the phenotype distribution in high phenotype dimension--which is potentially more biologically relevant than low phenotype dimension--allows altruists to better resist the invasion by cheaters, and as a result the amount of donation increases with increasing phenotype dimension. We also generalize previous results in the regime of weak selection to two competing strategies in continuous phenotype space, and show that success under weak selection is crucial to success under strong selection in our model. Our results support the viability of a simple similarity-based mechanism for altruism in a well-mixed population.",

    "abstract": "One of the most interesting macroscopic phenomena in the animal world is seasonal migration. A central goal of research into animal migration is to better understand the mechanisms that evolved to solve the complex challenges which a migratory life history presents. Each year, and with a high degree of species-level site fidelity, the Australian Bogong moth makes a return migration of up to and over 1000 km between widely distributed breeding grounds and a specific set of aestivation sites in the Australian Alps. It does this without any opportunity to learn the migratory route or the location of the aestivation sites from either older generations or repeated migrations, meaning that the information required by the moth to navigate during its migration must be inherited. The migratory direction, and therefore the inherited navigational information in Bogong moths, varies with breeding site, providing us with an opportunity to search for the source of that heritability by comparing the genomes of moths collected from different breeding areas. We successfully sequenced whole nuclear genomes of 77 Bogong moths collected from across their breeding grounds and summer range, and found that the Bogong moth population contains a large amount of (mostly rare) variation. We found no evidence of population structure, indicating that Bogong moths are panmictic. A genome-wide scan for signals of selection indicate that the Bogong population has recently recovered from a past bottleneck, however genomic regions which have likely undergone balancing selection were also detected. Despite panmixia, four genetic variants in breeding-ground-caught Bogong moths were found to be significantly associated with geographic location, and therefore migratory direction, indicating promising future avenues of research into the molecular basis of long-distance navigation.",

    "abstract": "Molecular adaptations are prevalent in carnivorous plants in response to habitat and environmental stress. We used the chloroplast genome and characterized the specific adaptations in the photosystem genes and their interacting partners in Nepenthes khasiana, a carnivorous pitcher plant. When compared with the carnivorous and non-carnivorous groups across Caryophyllales, Lamiales, Poales, Ericales, and Oxalidales, we found Nepenthes-specific changes in psaA, psaB, psaC and psaH. Of these, only a single amino acid change each, G147 in the protein psaA and R40 in the protein ndhD, impacted the three-dimensional structural conformation of the corresponding proteins. Modeling the interaction between the psaA and the ndhD proteins identified group-specific changes between the models between Nepentheceae versus others. The least distance between the structure-impacting residues of psaA and ndhD was 25.9 [A] for Nepenthes and 19.4 [A] for non-Nepenthes models. Given that the chloroplast ndh and photosystem I subunits form a large super-complex with the light-harvesting carrier proteins from the nucleus to mediate cyclic electron transport, our observations may indicate specific adaptations in the cyclic electron transport arm of the photosynthetic machinery in the Nepenthes species.",

However, in perturbation experiments, current methods typically fail to correctly match cell states between conditions or erroneously remove population substructure. Here we present the novel, unsupervised algorithm ICAT that employs self-supervised feature weighting and control-guided clustering to accurately resolve cell states across heterogeneous conditions.\n\nResultsUsing simulated and real datasets, we show ICAT is superior in identifying and resolving cell states compared to current integration workflows. While requiring no a priori knowledge of extant cell states or discriminatory marker genes, ICAT is robust to low signal strength, high perturbation severity, and disparate cell type proportions. We empirically validate ICAT in a developmental model and find that only ICAT identifies a perturbation-unique cellular response. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ICAT offers a significant improvement in defining cellular responses to perturbation in single-cell RNA sequencing data.\n\nAvailability and implementationhttps://github.com/BradhamLab/icat\n\nSupplemental Methods, Tables and Figures are available online.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) are two crucial steps in the post-transcriptional regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. Protocols capturing and sequencing RNA 3-ends have uncovered widespread intronic polyadenylation (IPA) in normal and disease conditions, where it is currently attributed to stochastic variations in the pre-mRNA processing. Here, we took advantage of the massive amount of RNA-seq data generated by the Genotype Tissue Expression project (GTEx) to simultaneously identify and match tissue-specific expression of intronic polyadenylation sites with tissue-specific splicing. A combination of computational methods including the analysis of short reads with non-templated adenines revealed that APA events are more abundant in introns than in exons. While the rate of IPA in composite terminal exons and skipped terminal exons expectedly correlates with splicing, we observed a considerable fraction of IPA events that lack AS support and attributed them to spliced polyadenylated introns (SPI). We hypothesize that SPIs represent transient byproducts of a dynamic coupling between APA and AS, in which the spliceosome removes an intron after cleavage and polyadenylation have already occurred in it. These findings indicate that cotranscriptional pre-mRNA splicing could serve as a rescue mechanism to suppress premature transcription termination at intronic polyadenylation sites.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticles are increasingly employed as a vehicle for the targeted delivery of therapeutics to specific cell types. However, much remains to be discovered about the fundamental biology that dictates the interactions between nanoparticles and cells. Accordingly, few nanoparticle-based targeted therapeutics have succeeded in clinical trials. One element that hinders our understanding of nanoparticle-cell interactions is the presence of heterogeneity in nanoparticle dosage data obtained from standard experiments. It is difficult to distinguish between heterogeneity that arises from stochasticity in nanoparticle behaviour, and that which arises from heterogeneity in the cell population. Mathematical investigations have revealed that both sources of heterogeneity contribute meaningfully to the heterogeneity in nanoparticle dosage. However, these investigations have relied on simplified models of nanoparticle internalisation. Here we present a stochastic mathematical model of nanoparticle internalisation that incorporates a suite of relevant biological phenomena such as multistage internalisation, cell division, asymmetric nanoparticle inheritance and nanoparticle saturation. Critically, our model provides information about nanoparticle dosage at an individual cell level. We perform model simulations to examine the influence of specific biological phenomena on the heterogeneity in nanoparticle dosage. Under certain modelling assumptions, we derive analytic approximations of the nanoparticle dosage distribution. We demonstrate that the analytic approximations are accurate, and show that nanoparticle dosage can be described by a Poisson mixture distribution with rate parameters that are a function of Beta-distributed random variables. We discuss the implications of the analytic results with respect to parameter estimation and model identifiability from standard experimental data. Finally, we highlight extensions and directions for future research.",

Cefepime was quantified in plasma, cerebral cortex and hippocampus via liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Multiple PK/PD models of cefepime transit between plasma and brain compartments (i.e. cerebral cortex and hippocampus) and neurotoxic response were explored using Monolix 2021R1 (LixoftPK).\n\nResultsExposure estimation of cerebral cortex demonstrated a median (IQR) AUC0 -24 and Cmax 0 -24 of 181.8 (85.2-661.3) mg {middle dot} 24 h/liter and 13.9 (1.0-30.1) mg/L, respectively. The median cerebral cortex/blood percentage of penetration was 1.7%. Exposure estimation of hippocampus demonstrated a median (IQR) AUC0 -24 and Cmax 0 -24 of 291.4 (126.6-1091.6) mg {middle dot} 24 h/liter and 8.8 (3.4-33.4) mg/L, respectively.

    "abstract": "Patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) experience diaphragm weakness that contributes to the primary disease symptoms of fatigue, dyspnea, and exercise intolerance. Weakness in the diaphragm is related to excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the exact source of ROS remains unknown. NAD(P)H Oxidases (Nox), particularly the Nox2 and 4 isoforms, are important sources of ROS within skeletal muscle that contribute to optimal cell function. There are reports of increased Nox activity in the diaphragm of patients and animal models of HFrEF, implicating these complexes as possible sources of diaphragm dysfunction in HFrEF. To investigate the role of these proteins on diaphragm weakness in HFrEF, we generated inducible skeletal muscle specific knockouts of Nox2 or Nox4 using the Cre-Lox system and assessed diaphragm function in a mouse model of HFrEF induced by myocardial infarction. Diaphragm maximal specific force measured in vitro was depressed by ~20% with HFrEF. Knockout of Nox4 provided full protection against the loss of maximal force (p < 0.01), while the knockout of Nox2 provided partial protection (7% depression, p < 0.01). Mitochondrial respiration measured in permeabilized diaphragm muscle bundles increased with HFrEF or the knockout of Nox4 from skeletal muscle fibers (p < 0.05). Knockout of Nox2 from skeletal myofibers improved survival from 50 to 80% following myocardial infarction (p = 0.026). Our findings show an important role for skeletal muscle NAD(P)H Oxidases contributing to loss of diaphragm maximal force in HFrEF, along with systemic pathophysiological responses following myocardial infarction.",

    "abstract": "Semidwarfing genes have greatly increased wheat yields globally, yet the widely used gibberellin (GA) insensitive genes Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b have disadvantages for seedling emergence. Use of the GA sensitive semidwarfing gene Rht13 avoids this pleiotropic effect. Here we show that Rht13 encodes a nucleotide-binding site/leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) gene. A point mutation in the semidwarf Rht-B13b allele autoactivates the NB-LRR gene and causes a height reduction comparable to Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b in diverse genetic backgrounds. The autoactive Rht-B13b allele leads to transcriptional upregulation of pathogenesis-related genes including class III peroxidases associated with cell wall remodelling. Rht13 represents a new class of reduced height (Rht) gene, unlike other Rht genes which encode components of the GA signalling or metabolic pathways. This discovery opens new avenues to use autoactive NB-LRR genes as semidwarfing genes in a range of crop species, and to apply Rht13 in wheat breeding programmes using a perfect genetic marker.",

    "abstract": "Amphetamine (AMPH), a psychostimulant commonly prescribed for the treatment of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders, has a high liability for abuse. The abuse and psychomotor stimulant properties of AMPH are primarily associated with its ability to increase dopamine (DA) neurotransmission. This increase is mediated, in large part, by non-vesicular DA release (DA efflux). DA efflux is the result of reversal of the DA transporter (DAT) promoted by AMPH. Syntaxin 1 (Stx1) is a SNARE protein that plays a pivotal role in vesicular release. Previously, we have shown that Stx1 also interacts with the distal DAT N-terminus, an event promoted by AMPH. Stx1 is phosphorylated at Ser14 by casein kinase II (CK2). Using Drosophila Melanogaster as an animal model, we show that this phosphorylation event is critical for non-vesicular DA release and regulates the expression of AMPH preference as well as the ability of AMPH to promote mating drive. We also show that reverse transport of DA mediated by DAT underlies these complex behaviors promoted by AMPH. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the phosphorylated DAT/Stx1 complex demonstrate that the phosphorylation state of these proteins plays a key role in allowing DAT to dwell in an efflux-willing state. This state also supports constitutive DA efflux (CDE), an event that occurs in the absence of AMPH. The DAT-Stx1 phosphorylated complex is characterized by the breakdown of two key salt bridges in DAT, K66-D345 and E428-R445, which are critical for the formation of the intracellular (IC) gate and for transport function. The breaking of these salt bridges leads to an opening and hydration of the DAT intracellular vestibule, allowing DA to bind from the cytosol, a mechanism that we hypothesize leads to CDE. We further determine the importance of Stx1 phosphorylation in CDE by pharmacologically inhibiting CK2 with CX-4945, a molecule currently in phase II clinical trials for cancer treatment. CX-4945 treatment prevented the expression of CDE in isolated Drosophila Melanogaster brains as well as behaviors associated with CDE. Thus, our results suggest that Stx1 phosphorylation is a possible pharmacological target for the treatment of AMPH abuse.",

    "abstract": "Chemical defences often vary within and between populations both in quantity and quality, which is puzzling if prey survival is dependent on the strength of the defence. We investigated the within-and between-population variability in chemical defence of the wood tiger moth (Arctia plantaginis). The major components of its defences, SBMP (2-sec-butyl-3-methoxypyrazine) and IBMP (2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine) are volatiles that deter bird attacks. We expected the variation to reflect populations predation pressures and early-life conditions. To understand the role of the methoxypyrazines, we experimentally manipulated synthetic SBMP and IBMP and tested the birds reactions. We found a considerable variation in methoxypyrazine amounts and composition, both from wild-caught and laboratory-raised male moths. In agreement with the \"cost of defence\" hypothesis, the moths raised in the laboratory had a higher amount of pyrazines. We found that SBMP is more effective at higher concentrations and that IBMP is more effective only in combination with SBMP and at lower concentrations. Our results fit findings from the wild: the amount of SBMP was higher in the populations with higher predation pressure. Altogether, this suggests that, regarding pyrazine concentration, more is not always better, and highlights the importance of testing the efficacy of chemical defence and its components with relevant predators, rather than relying only on results from chemical analyses.",

Here, we investigate the differences in the tempo and mode of adaptation on the X chromosome and autosomes in a population of Drosophila melanogaster. Specifically, we test the hypothesis that due to hemizygosity and a lower effective population size on the X, the relative proportion of hard sweeps, which are expected when adaptation is gradual, compared to soft sweeps, which are expected when adaptation is rapid, is greater on the X than on the autosomes. We quantify the incidence of hard versus soft sweeps in North American D. melanogaster population genomic data with haplotype homozygosity statistics and find an enrichment of the proportion of hard versus soft sweeps on the X chromosome compared to the autosomes, confirming predictions we make from simulations. Understanding these differences may enable a deeper understanding of how important phenotypes arise as well as the impact of fundamental evolutionary parameters on adaptation, such as dominance, sex-specific selection, and sex-biased demography.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDetecting differentially expressed genes is important for characterizing subpopulations of cells. In scRNA-seq data, however, nuisance variation due to technical factors like sequencing depth and RNA capture efficiency obscures the underlying biological signal. Deep generative models have been extensively applied to scRNA-seq data, with a special focus on embedding cells into a low-dimensional latent space and correcting for batch effects. However, little attention has been given to the problem of utilizing the uncertainty from the deep generative model for differential expression. Furthermore, the existing approaches do not allow controlling for the effect size or the false discovery rate. Here, we present lvm-DE, a generic Bayesian approach for performing differential expression from using a fitted deep generative model, while controlling the false discovery rate. We apply the lvm-DE framework to scVI and scSphere, two deep generative models. The resulting approaches outperform the state-of-the-art methods at estimating the log fold change in gene expression levels, as well as detecting differentially expressed genes between subpopulations of cells.",

    "abstract": "2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) is recognized as an epigenetic regulator in cancer and some transient biological processes. Of all organs, the testis harbors the highest baseline physiological levels of 2HG, yet its putative functions in germ cell biology are unknown. Here we show that 2HG is generated in specific stages of spermatogenesis by the testis specific lactate dehydrogenase C (LDHC), beginning at the last stages of prophase I. Unexpectedly LDHC enters nuclei and concentrates in centromeres. LDHC-generated L-2HG controls centromere condensation and pericentromeric heterochromatin organization through multiple effects including clustering of chromocenters, centromere and chromocenter condensation and expression of satellite RNAs. These effects are rapid and specific to L but not D-2HG. In vivo depletion of L-2HG causes centromere malfunction and activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Our findings reveal that 2HG can directly affect centromere and pericentromeric heterochromatin conformation and function and is necessary for licensing chromosome segregation.",

    "abstract": "The internal transcribed spacers (ITS) exhibit concerted evolution by the fast homogenization of these sequences at the intragenomic level. However, the rate and extension of this process are unclear and might be conditioned by the number and divergence of the different ITS copies. In some cases, such as hybrid species and polyploids, ITS sequence homogenization appears incomplete, resulting in multiple haplotypes within the same organism. Here, we studied the dynamics of concerted evolution in 85 individuals of seven plant species of the genus Erysimum (Brassicaceae) with multiple ploidy levels. We estimated the rate of concerted evolution and the degree of sequence homogenization separately for ITS1 and ITS2 and whether these varied with ploidy. Our results showed incomplete sequence homogenization, especially for polyploid samples, indicating a lack of concerted evolution in these taxa. Homogenization was usually higher in ITS2 than in ITS1, suggesting that concerted evolution operates more efficiently on the former. Furthermore, the hybrid origin of several species appears to contribute to the maintenance of high haplotype diversity, regardless of the level of ploidy. These findings indicate that sequence homogenization of ITS is a dynamic and complex process that might result in varying intra- and inter-genomic diversity levels.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, major advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have enabled the routine determination of complex biomolecular structures at atomic resolution. An open challenge for this approach, however, concerns large systems that exhibit continuous dynamics. To address this problem, we developed the metadynamic electron-microscopy metainference (MEMMI) method, which incorporates metadynamics, an enhanced conformational sampling approach, into the metainference method of integrative structural biology. MEMMI enables the simultaneous determination of the structure and dynamics of large heterogeneous systems by combining cryo-EM density maps with prior information through molecular dynamics, while at the same time modelling the different sources of error. To illustrate the method, we apply it to elucidate the dynamics of an amyloid fibril of the islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP). The resulting conformational ensemble provides an accurate description of the structural variability of the disordered region of the amyloid fibril, known as fuzzy coat. The conformational ensemble also reveals that in nearly half of the structural core of this amyloid fibril the side-chains exhibit liquid-like dynamics despite the presence of the highly ordered network backbone of hydrogen bonds characteristic of the cross-{beta} structure of amyloid fibrils.",

Their functional and morphological heterogeneity is well known, though the origin of this heterogeneity is still debated. Furthermore, while mouse strains differ in the type of immune responses that they mount to individual pathogens, the range of gene expression variation among their macrophages in the absence of a specific stimulus is not known. By applying single cell RNA sequencing we here reveal the gene expression variation in pre-stimulation macrophage populations from specific pathogen-free BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, two mouse strains that give prototypical Th2 and Th1-biased immune responses, directed towards extracellular or intracellular pathogens, respectively. We show that intrinsic differences between the macrophages of these two strains are detectable before any specific stimulation and we place the gene expression profile of these cells within the range of variation that is measured upon in vitro stimulation with pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon {gamma} (IFN), or anti-inflammatory IL-4. We find that C57BL/6 mice show stronger evidence of macrophage polarization than BALB/c mice, which could explain their resistance to pathogens such as Leishmania. Our computational methods for analyzing single cell RNA sequencing data, controlling for common sources of stochastic variation, can be more generally adopted to uncover biological variation between cell populations.",

Here we developed a strategy to label AMPAR GluA1 subunits expressed from the endogenous loci of rat hippocampal neurons such that the motion of GluA1-containing vesicles in time-lapse sequences can be characterized using single-particle tracking and mathematical modeling. We find that GluA1- containing vesicles are confined and concentrated near sites of stimulation-induced plasticity. We show that confinement is mediated by actin polymerization, which hinders the active transport of GluA1-containing vesicles along the length of the dendritic shaft by modulating the rheological properties of the cytoplasm. Actin polymerization also facilitates myosin-mediated transport of GluA1-containing vesicles to exocytic sites. We conclude that neurons utilize F- actin to increase vesicular GluA1 reservoirs and promote exocytosis proximal to the sites of neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "By far most urinary tract infections are caused by genetically diverse uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). Knowledge of the virulence mechanisms of UPEC is critical for drug development, but most studies focus on only a single strain of UPEC. In this study, we compared the virulence mechanisms of four antibiotic-resistant and highly pathogenic UPEC isolates in human blood monocyte-derived macrophages and a bladder epithelial cell (BEC) line: ST999, ST131, ST1981 and ST95. We found that while non-pathogenic E. coli strains are efficiently killed by macrophages in bactericidal single membrane vacuoles, the UPEC strains survive within double-membrane vacuoles. On side-by-side comparison, we found that whereas ST999 only carries Fe3+ importers, ST95 carries both Fe2+ and Fe3+ importers and the toxins haemolysin and colibactin. Moreover, we found that ST999 grows in the Fe3+ rich vacuoles of BECs and macrophages with concomitant increased expression of haem receptor chuA and the hydrogen peroxide sensor oxyR. In contrast, ST95 produces toxins in iron-depleted conditions similar to that of the urinary tract. Whereas ST95 also persist in the iron rich vacuoles of BECs, it produces colibactin in response to low Fe3+ contributing to macrophage death. Thus, iron regulates the contrasting toxicities of UPEC strains in macrophages and bladder epithelial cells due to low and high labile iron concentrations, respectively.\n\nKey findingsO_LIAntibiotics resistant uropathogenic E. coli strains ST999, ST131, ST1981, and ST95 survive within spacious double membrane vacuoles.

    "abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening clinical condition defined by rapid onset respiratory failure following acute lung injury (ALI). Its increased incidence due to COVID-19 and high mortality rate ([~]40%) make the study of ARDS pathogenesis a crucial research priority. CRTH2 is a G protein-coupled receptor with established roles in type 2 immunity and well-characterized inhibitors. Prior studies have shown it also promotes neutrophilic inflammation, indicating that CRTH2 inhibition may be a potential therapeutic strategy for ARDS. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the expression pattern of CRTH2 on murine neutrophils. We found it is expressed on neutrophils, but only after extravasation into the lung. Next, we showed that extravasated lung neutrophils generate inflammatory responses upon stimulation with the CRTH2-specific agonist DK-PGD2, as demonstrated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. This response was abrogated in CRTH2 KO neutrophils. Inhibition of CRTH2 with fevipiprant suppressed baseline ROS production, indicating an autocrine PGD2-CRTH2 signaling loop. We then evaluated the role of CRTH2 in vivo using a murine model of LPS-induced ALI. Despite the pro-inflammatory effects of CRTH2 on neutrophils in vitro, we observed worsening of lung injury in CRTH2-deficient mice in terms of neutrophilic inflammation, vascular leak, and survival. Bulk RNAseq of lung tissue indicated an impairment in type 2 immune signaling; qPCR and ELISA confirmed downregulation of the key type 2 effector cytokine, IL-4. Thus, CRTH2 appears to play a dual role in ALI, directly promoting neutrophil effector responses, but indirectly suppressing lung injury and neutrophilic inflammation through type 2 immunity. These findings reveal a novel protective function for CRTH2 during lung injury and argue against the use of CRTH2 inhibitors in ARDS.",

    "abstract": "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection alters natural killer (NK) cell phenotype and function toward a more memory-like immune state. These cells, termed adaptive NK cells, typically express CD57 and NKG2C but lack expression of the Fc receptor {gamma} chain (Gene: FCER1G, FcR{gamma}), PLZF, and SYK. Functionally, adaptive NK cells display enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and cytokine production. However, the mechanism behind this enhanced function is unknown. To understand what drives cytotoxicity and cytokine production in adaptive NK cells, we optimized a CRISPR/Cas9 system to ablate genes from primary human NK cells. ADCC by human NK cells is exclusively mediated by the CD16A (Fc{gamma}RIIIA) signaling apparatus, which includes FcR{gamma}, CD3{zeta}, SYK, SHP-1, ZAP-70, and the transcription factor PLZF. We ablated the genes encoding these molecules and tested subsequent ADCC and cytokine production. We found that ablating the FcR{gamma} chain caused a modest increase in TNF production. Ablation of PLZF did not enhance ADCC or cytokine production. Importantly, SYK kinase ablation significantly enhanced both cytotoxicity and cytokine production, while ZAP-70 kinase ablation diminished function. Ablation of the phosphatase SHP-1 resulted in mixed effects on function, with NK cells demonstrating enhanced cytotoxicity but reduced cytokine production. These results indicate that the enhanced cytotoxicity and cytokine production of CMV-induced adaptive NK cells is more likely due to the loss of SYK than the lack of FcR{gamma} or PLZF. The lack of SYK expression may limit SHP-1-mediated inhibition of CD16A signaling, leading to enhanced cytotoxicity and cytokine production. In addition to providing mechanistic answers about CMV-induced adaptive NK cell functionality, our results indicate that NK chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapeutics that invoke ADCC signaling molecules (e.g., CD3{zeta} chain) may benefit from ablating SYK, while maintaining ZAP-70, to increase functionality.",

The infectious form of C. burnetii is the dormant small cell variant (SCV) that transitions to a metabolically active large cell variant (LCV) that replicates inside the lysosome-derived host vacuole. A Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS), which can deliver over 100 effector proteins to host cells, is essential for the biogenesis of the vacuole and for intracellular replication. How the distinct C. burnetii life cycle impacts the assembly and function of the Dot/Icm T4SS has remained unknown. Here, we combine advanced cryo-focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) milling and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) imaging to visualize all developmental transitions and assembly of the Dot/Icm T4SS. Importantly, assembled Dot/Icm T4SSs were not present in the infectious SCV. The appearance of an assembled Dot/Icm machine correlated with the transition of the SCV to the LCV intracellularly. Furthermore, temporal characterization of C. burnetii morphological changes revealed regions of the inner membrane that invaginated to form tightly packed stacks during the LCV to SCV transition at late stages of infection, which could enable the SCV to LCV transition that occurs upon infection of a new host cell. Overall, these data establish how C. burnetii developmental transitions control critical bacterial processes to promote intracellular replication and transmission.",

However, for complex MLOs such as the perinuclear germ granule in C. elegans, our understanding of how the organelle as a whole is regulated is hampered by 1) the technical limitations in confocal fluorescence imaging in which only a few granule protein markers can be examined at a time and 2) the inaccessibility of electron microscopy. In this study, we take advantage of the newly developed super-resolution method of expansion microscopy (ExM) and in-situ staining of the whole proteome to examine the C. elegans germ granule, the P granule. We show that in small RNA pathway mutants, the P granule is smaller compared with wild type animals. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between the P granule and two other germ granules, mutator foci and Z granule, and show that they are located within the same protein-dense regions while occupying distinct subdomains within this ultrastructure. The experimental workflow developed here will serve as an important tool in our understanding of germ granule biology as well as the biological role of LLPS.",

    "abstract": "1Predicting phenotypic evolution on the short-term of tens to hundreds of generations, particularly in changing environments and under finite population sizes, is an important theoretical goal. Because organisms are not simply collections of independent traits, making headway into this goal requires understanding if the phenotypic plasticity of ancestral populations aligns with the phenotypic dimensions that contain more genetic variation for selection to be effective and eventually feedback on the maintenance of genetic variation and promote adaptation or rescue from extinction. By performing 50 generations of experimental evolution in a changing environment we show that ancestral phenotypic plasticity for locomotion behavior in the partially-outcrossing nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is nonadaptive because it does not align with the phenotypic dimension encompassing most genetic variance in the ancestral population and is of no consequence to future phenotypic divergence. Despite evolution of the genetic structure of locomotion behavior we are able to predict the direction of phenotypic divergence, but not the magnitude, based on the genetic covariances between the component traits of locomotion behavior and fitness of the ancestral population. We further demonstrate that indirect selection on the component traits of locomotion behavior with unobserved trait(s) is responsible for the observed phenotypic divergence on them. Our findings indicate that selection theory can predict the direction of short-term adaptive phenotypic evolution.",

    "abstract": "Whether or not genetic divergence on the short-term of tens to hundreds of generations is compatible with phenotypic stasis remains a relatively unexplored problem. We evolved predominantly outcrossing, genetically diverse populations of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans under a constant and homogeneous environment for 240 generations, and followed individual locomotion behavior. Although founders of lab populations show highly diverse locomotion behavior, during lab evolution the component traits of locomotion behavior - defined as the transition rates in activity and direction - did not show divergence from the ancestral population. In contrast, transition rates genetic (co)variance structure showed a marked divergence from the ancestral state and differentiation among replicate populations during the final 100 generations and after most adaptation had been achieved. We observe that genetic differentiation is a transient pattern during the loss of genetic variance along phenotypic dimensions under drift during the last 100 generations of lab evolution. These results suggest that once adaptation has occurred, and on the short-term of tens of generations, stasis of locomotion behavior is maintained because of effective stabilizing selection at a large phenotypic scale. At the same time, the genetic structuring of component traits is contingent upon drift history at a local phenotypic scale.",

    "abstract": "1Because of pleiotropy, mutations affect the expression and inheritance of multiple traits and are expected to determine the structure of standing genetic variation and phenotypic evolution. It is thus important to find if the M matrix, describing mutational (co)variances between traits, varies between genotypes. We here estimate the M matrix for six locomotion behavior traits in two genotypes of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We find significant mutational variance along at least one phenotypic dimension of the M matrix, but its size and orientation was similar between genotypes. We then tested if the M matrices were similar to one G matrix describing the standing genetic (co)variances of a domesticated population derived by the hybridization of several genotypes and adapted to a lab defined environment for 140 generations. M and G are different in part because the genetic covariances caused by mutational pleiotropy in the two genotypes are smaller than those caused by standing linkage disequilibrium in the lab population. If generalized to other genotypes, these observations indicate that selection is unlikely to shape the evolution of the M matrix for locomotion behavior and suggests that the genetic restructuring due to the hybridization of C. elegans genotypes allows for selection in the lab on new phenotypic dimensions of locomotion behavior, phenotypic dimensions which are inaccessible to natural populations.",

    "abstract": "Highly fecund natural populations characterized by high early mortality abound, yet our knowledge about their recruitment dynamics is somewhat rudimentary. This knowledge gap has implications for our understanding of genetic variation, population connectivity, local adaptation, and the resilience of highly fecund populations. The concept of sweepstakes reproductive success, which posits a considerable variance and skew in individual reproductive output, is key to understanding the distribution of individual reproductive success. However, it still needs to be determined whether highly fecund organisms reproduce through sweepstakes and, if they do, the relative roles of neutral and selective sweepstakes. Here we use coalescent-based statistical analysis of population genomic data to show that selective sweepstakes likely explain recruitment dynamics in the highly fecund Atlantic cod. We show that the Kingman coalescent (modeling no sweepstakes) and the Xi-Beta coalescent (modeling random sweepstakes), including complex demography and background selection, do not provide an adequate fit for the data. The Durrett-Schweinsberg coalescent, in which selective sweepstakes result from recurrent and pervasive selective sweeps of new mutations, offers greater explanatory power. Our results show that models of sweepstakes reproduction and multiple-merger coalescents are relevant and necessary for understanding genetic diversity in highly fecund natural populations. These findings have fundamental implications for understanding the recruitment variation of fish stocks and general evolutionary genomics of high-fecundity organisms.",

    "abstract": "SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWIn clinical research, it is of importance to study whether certain clinical factors or exposures have causal effects on clinical and patient reported outcomes like toxicities, quality of life, and self-reported symptoms, which can help improve patient care. Usually, such outcomes are recorded as multiple variables with different distributions. Mendelian randomization is a commonly used technique for causal inference with the help of genetic instrumental variables to deal with observed and unobserved confounders. Nevertheless, the current methodology of Mendelian randomization on multiple outcomes only focuses on one outcome at a time, meaning that it does not consider the correlation structure of multiple outcomes, which may lead to loss of statistical power. In situations with multiple outcomes of interest, especially when there are mixed correlated outcomes with multiple distributions, it is much more desirable to jointly analyze them with a multivariate approach. Some multivariate methods have been proposed to model mixed outcomes, however, they do not incorporate instrumental variables and cannot handle unmeasured confounders. To overcome the above challenges, we propose a two-stage multivariate Mendelian Randomization Method (MRMO), that can perform multivariate analysis on mixed outcomes using instrumental variables. We demonstrate that our proposed MRMO algorithm can gain power over the existing univariate method through simulation studies and a clinical application on a randomized Phase III clinical trial study on colorectal cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Anas platyrynchos (ducks) are reared mostly for egg, which are very nutritious, that fetch better prices, however duck meat possess rich nutrient content. They possess the unique characteristics of disease resistance to the common avian diseases, even asymptomatic to avian influenza, with a scopeto evolve as one of the best poultry species The major limitation encountered is the lowered average egg production as well as higher age at first egg (an indicator for sexual maturity) for the indigenous ducks compared to that of exotic ones. In this current study, we attempt to explore the genes responsible for duck reproduction in terms of sexual maturity,egg production and fertility of the ducks. We had compared the genomic constitution for the Bengal duck with highest egg production with that of non-layer (infertile or sexually immature) ducks. We characterized the genes in indigenous ducks from ovarian tissues, identified important domains for characterized genes for the first time, and studied differential mRNA expression profiling for these genes with respect to layer and non-layer groups. Upregulation was observed for ESR2, DIAPH2, KMT2E, ASCF2 genes for Bengal duck in highest egg producing duck in comparison to non-layer duck, whereas downregulation was observed for KSR1, A2M, BMPR1B, ACVR1. In the next step, we explored the association with the genes which were actually responsible for egg production. Thus, duck may be utilized as a model for studying the molecular aspect of reproduction. Genes upregulated may be utilized for knock in of gene, whereas down regulated genes may be knocked out or knocked down through gene editing technologies for the improvement of reproductive performance of the duck in future. Molecular biomarkers may be developed with these genes for early selection of better reproducing ducks at day of hatch or even earlier.",

Understanding how conformational populations of nuclear receptors are shifted by various ligands could illuminate strategies for the design of synthetic modulators to regulate specific transcriptional programs. Here, we investigate ligand-induced conformational changes using a reconstructed, ancestral nuclear receptor. By making substitutions at a key position, we engineer receptor variants with altered ligand specificities. We use atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with enhanced sampling to generate ensembles of wildtype and engineered receptors in combination with multiple ligands, followed by conformational analysis and prediction of ligand activity. We combine cellular and biophysical experiments to allow correlation of MD-based predictions with functional ligand profiles, as well as elucidation of mechanisms underlying altered transcription in receptor variants. We determine that conformational ensembles accurately predict ligand responses based on observed population shifts, even within engineered receptors that were constitutively active or transcriptionally unresponsive in experiments. These studies provide a platform which will allow structural characterization of physiologically-relevant conformational ensembles, as well as provide the ability to design and predict transcriptional responses in novel ligands.",

Recent work showed that complexes comprising hIL-2 and the anti-hIL-2 antibody F5111 overcome these limitations by preferentially stimulating TRegs over immune effector cells. Although promising, therapeutic translation of this approach is complicated by the need to optimize dosing ratios and by the instability of the cytokine/antibody complex. We leveraged structural insights to engineer a single-chain hIL-2/F5111 antibody fusion protein, termed F5111 immunocytokine (IC), that potently and selectively activates and expands TRegs. F5111 IC conferred protection in mouse models of colitis and checkpoint inhibitor-induced diabetes mellitus.

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) is a pre-synaptic monomeric protein that can form aggregates in neurons in Parkinsons disease (PD), Parkinsons disease with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and in oligodendrocytes in multiple system atrophy (MSA). Although the accumulation of aSyn in astrocytes has previously been described in PD, PDD and DLB, the biochemical properties of aSyn in this type of pathology and its topographical distribution have not been studied in detail. Here, we present a systematic investigation of aSyn astrocytic pathology, using an expanded toolset of antibodies covering the entire sequence and known post-translational modifications (PTMs) of aSyn in Lewy body (LB) disorders, including sporadic PD, PDD, DLB, familial PD with SNCA G51D mutation and SNCA duplication, and in MSA. Astrocytic aSyn was mainly detected in the limbic cortical regions of LB disorders, but were absent in key pathological regions of MSA. These astrocytic aSyn accumulations were detected only with aSyn antibodies against the mid N-terminal and non-amyloid component (NAC) regions covering aSyn residues 34-99. The astroglial accumulations were negative to canonical aSyn aggregation markers, including p62, ubiquitin and aSyn pS129, but positive for phosphorylated and nitrated forms of aSyn at Tyrosine 39 (Y39), and mostly not resistant to proteinase K. Our findings suggest that astrocytic aSyn accumulations are a major part of aSyn pathology in LB disorders, and possess a distinct sequence and PTM signature that is characterized by both N- and C-terminal truncations and modifications at Y39. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of aSyn accumulation made solely from N- and C-terminally cleaved aSyn species and the first report demonstrating that astrocytic aSyn exists as a mixture of Y39 phosphorylated and nitrated species. These observations underscore the critical importance of systematic characterization of aSyn accumulation in different cell types as a necessary step to capturing the diversity of aSyn species and pathology in the brain. Our findings combined with further studies on the role of astrocytic pathology in the progression of LB disorders can pave the way towards identifying novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Innate immunity is an ancestral process that can induce pro- and anti-inflammatory states. A major challenge is to characterise the transcriptional cascades that modulate the response to chronic and acute inflammatory challenges. The Drosophila melanogaster Gcm transcription factor represents an interesting candidate for its potential anti-inflammatory role. Here we explore its evolutionary conservation and its mode of action. We found that the murine ortholog Gcm2 (mGcm2) is expressed upon aging, which is considered as a state of chronic inflammation. mGcm2 is found in a subpopulation of microglia, the innate immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). Its expression is also induced by a lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced CNS demyelination (acute inflammation) and mGcm2 conditional knock out mice show an increased inflammatory phenotype upon aging or LPC injection. In agreement with the role of this transcriptional cascade in inflammation, the human ortholog hGCM2 is expressed in active demyelinating lesions of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients. Finally, Drosophila gcm expression is induced upon aging as well as during an acute inflammatory response and its overexpression decreases the inflammatory phenotype. Altogether, our data show that the inducible Gcm pathway is highly conserved from flies up to humans and represents a potential therapeutic anti-inflammatory target in the control of the inflammatory response.",

    "abstract": "Replication of the circular bacterial chromosome is initiated from a locus oriC with the aid of an essential protein DnaA. One approach to identify factors acting to prevent aberrant oriC-independent replication initiation in Escherichia coli has been that to obtain mutants which survive loss of DnaA. Here we show that a {Delta}recD mutation, associated with attenuation of RecBCDs DNA double strand end-resection activity, provokes abnormal replication and rescues {Delta}dnaA lethality in two situations: (i) in absence of 5-3 single-strand DNA exonuclease RecJ, or (ii) when multiple two-ended DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are generated either by I-SceI endonucleolytic cleavages or by radiomimetic agents phleomycin or bleomycin. One-ended DSBs in the {Delta}recD mutant did not rescue {Delta}dnaA lethality. With two-ended DSBs in the {Delta}recD strain, {Delta}dnaA viability was retained even after linearization of the chromosome. Data from genome-wide DNA copy number determinations in {Delta}dnaA-rescued cells lead us to propose a model that nuclease-mediated DNA resection activity of RecBCD is critical for prevention of a {sigma}-mode of rolling-circle over-replication when convergent replication forks merge and fuse, as may be expected to occur during normal replication at the chromosomal terminus region or during repair of two-ended DSBs following \"ends-in\" replication.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence points out that sperm carry epigenetic instructions to embryo in the form of retained histones marks and RNA cargo that can transmit metabolic and behavioral traits to offspring. However, the mechanisms behind epigenetic inheritance of paternal environment are still poorly understood. Here, we curated male germ cells RNA-seq data and analyzed the expression profile of all known histone lysine writers and erasers enzymes across spermatogenesis, unraveling the developmental windows at which they are upregulated, and the specific activity related to canonical and non-canonical histone marks deposition and removal. We also characterized the epigenetic enzymes signature in the mature sperm RNA cargo, showing most of them positive translation at pre-cleavage zygote, suggesting that paternally-derived enzymes mRNA cooperate with maternal factors to embryo chromatin assembly. Our study shows several histone modifying enzymes not described yet in spermatogenesis and even more, important mechanistic aspects behind transgenerational epigenetics. Epigenetic enzymes not only can respond to environmental stressors, but could function as vectors of epigenetic information and participate in chromatin organization during maternal-to-zygote transition.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions provide essential ecosystem functions, such as promoting and maintaining diversity. Understanding if functionally important mutualisms are resilient (able to resist and recover) to anthropogenic disturbance is important to understand the capacity for diversity to recover. Animal-mediated seed dispersal supports plant population growth and community structure, and disturbance of this function can threaten plant diversity and contribute to low resiliency. Ant-mediated seed dispersal mutualisms are particularly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance, as they rely on one to a few high-quality dispersal partners. In North American eastern deciduous forests (NAEDF), ants in the genus Aphaenogaster are \"keystone dispersers\" of 30-40% of understory forbs adapted to dispersal by ants (myrmecochores). The majority of present day NAEDF have regenerated from previous disturbance in the form of historical land use change (HLUC), due to clearing for agriculture. Previous studies have revealed that myrmecochore diversity is not resilient to HLUC. Here, we ask if seed dispersal mutualisms are resilient to HLUC and if decreases in mutualistic interactions with partners, Aphaenogaster sp., or increases in antagonistic interactions cause degradation of function. In a large-scale natural experiment (20 sites), we measured seed removal, the abundance of mutualistic partners and other invertebrates interacting with seeds, myrmecochore cover and diversity, along with ant habitat and forest structure. We found lower and more variable seed removal in secondary forests compared to remnant forests. A path analysis of all forests revealed that abundance of mutualists was the primary determinant of variation in seed removal, and that seed damage by antagonists (invasive slugs) negatively affected dispersal and was higher in secondary forests. In a path analysis of remnant forests, the link between mutualist abundance and seed removal was absent, but present in the secondary forest path, suggesting that seed dispersal is more variable and dependent on mutualist abundance in secondary forests and is stable and high in remnant forests. Here we show that functional resilience to HLUC is variable and may impede recovery of understory plant communities. This work provides key insights on the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on mutualistic interactions and how the resilience of critical ecosystem functions impacts diversity resiliency.",

    "abstract": "In this article, we discuss the use of bipartite network analysis to understand and improve interdisciplinary teaching practice. We theorize mathematics and biology as part of a coevolving mutualistic ecosystem. As part of an interdisciplinary teaching initiative, we inventoried mathematics topics appearing in the marine biology classroom and their associated marine context. We then apply techniques of mutualistic bipartite networks analysis to this system to understand the use of mathematical concepts in a marine biology classroom. By analyzing the frequency and distribution of mathematics topics, we see that a variety of mathematical concepts are used across the course with most appearing only a few times. While this is an inherent trait of mutualistic coevolutionary networks, it can create a logistical challenge to supporting mathematics in the marine biology classroom. We find that marine biology topics containing the most mathematics are either close to the instructors research area or were introduced through externally developed educational resources. Finally, we analyze groups of topics that appear connected to each other more frequently to inform both interdisciplinary education development as well as disciplinary support. We also suggest ways to use network metrics to track interdisciplinary connections over time, helping us understand the impact of interventions on interdisciplinary teaching practice.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are central in the immune system, bridging the adaptive and innate immune responses. Research on in vitro differentiation of DCs from monocytes provides both in-depth understanding of the analogous in vivo process and potential sources for cancer cell therapy. Active DNA demethylation is crucial in DC differentiation. Vitamin C is a known cofactor of ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, which drive active demethylation. Currently, the effects of vitamin C treatment on human immune cells are poorly understood. In this study, we have studied the epigenomic and transcriptomic reprogramming orchestrated by vitamin C in monocyte-derived DC differentiation and maturation. Vitamin C triggers extensive demethylation at NF-kB/p65 binding sites, together with concordant upregulation of antigen-presentation immune response-related genes during DC maturation. p65 interacts with TET2 and mediates the aforementioned vitamin C-mediated changes, as demonstrated by pharmacological inhibition. Moreover, vitamin C increases TNF{beta} production in DCs through NF-kB, in concordance with the upregulation of its coding gene and the demethylation of adjacent CpGs. Finally, vitamin C enhances DCs ability to stimulate the proliferation of autologous antigen-specific T cells. We propose that vitamin C can improve monocyte-derived DC-based cell therapies. Finally, our results provide a feasible mechanism of action for intravenous high-dose vitamin C treatment in patients.",

    "abstract": "Pheochromocytomas (PCCs) and paragangliomas (PGLs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors. PGLs can further be divided into sympathetic (sPGLs) and head-and-neck (HN-PGLs). There are virtually no treatment options, and no cure, for metastatic PCCs and PGLs (PPGLs). Here, we composed a tissue microarray (TMA) consisting of 149 PPGLs, reflecting clinical features and presenting as a useful resource. Mutations in the pseudohypoxic marker EPAS1/HIF-2 correlates to an aggressive tumor phenotype. We show that HIF-2 unexpectedly localized to the cytoplasm in PPGLs. This subcompartmentalized protein expression differed between tumor subtypes, and strongly correlated to proliferation. Half of all sPGLs were metastatic at time of diagnosis. Cytoplasmic HIF-2 was strongly expressed in metastatic sPGLs and predicted poor outcome in this subgroup. We propose that cytoplasmic HIF-2 expression serves as a useful clinical marker to differentiate subtypes and predicting outcome, and hence can be used for improved targeted treatment in PPGLs.",
