    "abstract": "The Omicron lineage of SARS-CoV-2, first described in November 2021, spread rapidly to become globally dominant and has split into a number of sub-lineages. BA.1 dominated the initial wave but has been replaced by BA.2 in many countries. Recent sequencing from South Africas Gauteng region uncovered two new sub-lineages, BA.4 and BA.5 which are taking over locally, driving a new wave. BA.4 and BA.5 contain identical spike sequences and, although closely related to BA.2, contain further mutations in the receptor binding domain of spike. Here, we study the neutralization of BA.4/5 using a range of vaccine and naturally immune serum and panels of monoclonal antibodies. BA.4/5 shows reduced neutralization by serum from triple AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccinated individuals compared to BA.1 and BA.2. Furthermore, using serum from BA.1 vaccine breakthrough infections there are likewise, significant reductions in the neutralization of BA.4/5, raising the possibility of repeat Omicron infections.",

    "abstract": "Large predators often are believed to cause declines in hunter harvests of ungulates due to direct competition for prey with hunters. In Alberta, predators of elk (Cervus elaphus), including grizzly bear (Ursus arctos), cougar (Puma concolor), and wolf (Canis lupus), have increased in recent years. We used trend analysis replicated by Wildlife Management Unit (WMU) to examine regional trends in elk harvest and hunter success. Over a 26-year period, average harvest of elk increased for both unrestricted bull (5.46% yr-1) and limited-quota (6.64% yr-1) hunting seasons. Average hunter success also increased for both unrestricted bull (0.2% yr-1) and limited-quota (0.3% yr-1) seasons, but no trend was detected in hunter effort (P > 0.05). Our results show that increasing large-predator populations do not necessarily reduce hunter harvest of elk, and we only found evidence for this in Albertas mountain WMUs where predation on elk calves has reduced recruitment. Furthermore, data indicate that Albertas elk harvest management has been sustainable, i.e., hunting has continued while populations of elk have increased throughout most of the province. Wildlife agencies can justify commitments to long-term population monitoring because data allow adaptive management and can inform stakeholders on the status of populations.",

    "abstract": "Lysine-specific demethylase is a demethylase enzyme that can remove methyl groups from histones H3K4me1/2 and H3K9me1/2. It is expressed in many cancers, where it impedes differentiation and contributes to cancer cell proliferation, cell metastasis and is associated with inferior prognosis. LSD1 is associated with its corepressor protein CoREST, and utilizes tetrahydrofolate as a cofactor to accept CH2 from the demethylation process. The fact that the cofactor is best bound to the active site inspired us to explore its interactions to LSD1/CoREST enzyme complex utilizing molecular dynamics simulation, which aids designing novel and potent inhibitors. We have implemented a previously derived model from the MD simulation study and the key contacts to the active site in a subsequent structure based drug design and in-silico screening. In silico mining on National Cancer Institute (NCI) database identified 55 promising and structurally diverse inhibitors toward LSD1/CoREST complex. The anti-proliferative activities of the identified compounds were tested against neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cancer cell line which known to highly express LSD1/CoREST complex. Applying the abovementioned molecular modeling procedure yielded Four compounds of LSD1/CoREST inhibiters with IC50 <2{micro}M. The four lead compounds were tested against SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line that known to express high level of LSD1 and illustrated a potent activity with an IC50 ranging from 0.195 to 1.52{micro}M. To estimate the toxicity of the selective leads, they were tested against normal fibroblast cells and scored a relatively high IC50 ranging from 0.303 to [&ge;]100{micro}M. These compounds are excellent candidates treating cancers that overexpress the LSD1 enzyme.",
