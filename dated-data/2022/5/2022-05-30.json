    "abstract": "Adipogenesis is key to maintaining organism-wide energy balance and healthy metabolic phenotype, making it critical to thoroughly comprehend its molecular regulation in humans. By single-nuclei RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) of over 20,000 differentiating white and brown preadipocytes, we constructed a high-resolution temporal transcriptional landscape of human white and brown adipogenesis. White and brown preadipocytes were isolated from a single individuals neck region, thereby eliminating inter-subject variability across two distinct lineages. These preadipocytes were also immortalized to allow for controlled, in vitro differentiation, allowing sampling of distinct cellular states across the spectrum of adipogenic progression. Pseudotemporal cellular ordering revealed the dynamics of ECM remodeling during early adipogenesis, and lipogenic/thermogenic response during late white/brown adipogenesis. Comparison with adipogenic regulation in murine models revealed several targets for potential adipogenic/thermogenic drivers in humans. Key adipogenic and lipogenic markers revealed in our analysis were applied to analyze publicly available scRNA-seq datasets; these confirmed unique cell maturation features in recently discovered murine preadipocytes, and revealed inhibition of adipogenic expansion in humans with obesity. Overall, our study presents a comprehensive molecular description of both white and brown adipogenesis in humans and provides an important resource for future studies of adipose tissue development and function in both health and metabolic disease state.",

Our examination of faculty job postings from 2018 to 2021 found that while they decreased in 2020, the market recovered in 2021. We also surveyed how the pandemic affected the perceptions, behaviors, and outcomes of individuals on the faculty job market in 2019-20 and 2020-21. Approximately 10% of the faculty job offers made to 2019-20 survey respondents were reported as rescinded.

    "abstract": "Bacteria have evolved sophisticated and diverse immunity mechanisms to protect themselves against a nearly constant onslaught of bacteriophages1-3. Similar to how eukaryotic innate immune systems sense foreign invaders through pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)4, many bacterial immune systems that respond to bacteriophage infection require a phage-specific trigger to be activated. However, the identities of such triggers and the mechanistic basis of sensing remain almost completely unknown. Here, we discover and investigate the anti-phage function of a fused toxin-antitoxin (TA) system called CapRelSJ46 that protects E. coli against diverse phages. Through genetic, biochemical, and structural analysis, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of CapRelSJ46 regulates the toxic N-terminal region, serving as both an antitoxin element and a phage-infection sensor. Following infection by certain phages, the newly synthesized major capsid protein binds directly to the C-terminal domain of CapRelSJ46 to relieve autoinhibition, enabling the toxin domain to then pyrophosphorylate tRNAs, which blocks translation to restrict viral infection. Collectively, our results reveal the molecular mechanism by which a bacterial immune system directly senses a conserved, essential component of phages, suggesting a PAMP-like sensing model for TA-mediated innate immunity in bacteria. We provide evidence that CapRels and their phage-encoded triggers are engaged in a Red Queen conflict5, revealing a new front in the intense coevolutionary battle being waged by phage and bacteria. With capsid proteins of some eukaryotic viruses known to stimulate innate immune signaling in mammalian hosts6-10, our results now reveal an ancient, deeply conserved facet of immunity.",

    "abstract": "DNA-protein crosslinks (DPCs) pose a serious threat to genome stability. The yeast proteases Wss1, 26S proteasome and Ddi1 are safeguards of genome integrity by acting on a plethora of DNA-bound proteins in different cellular contexts. The AAA ATPase Cdc48/p97 is known to assist Wss1/SPRTN in clearing DNA-bound complexes, however its contribution to DPC proteolysis remains unclear. Here, we show that the Cdc48 adaptor Ubx5 is detrimental in yeast mutants defective in DPC processing. Using an inducible site-specific crosslink, we show that Ubx5 accumulates at persistent DPC lesions in the absence of Wss1, which prevents their efficient removal from the DNA. Abolishing Cdc48 binding or complete loss of Ubx5 suppresses the sensitivity of wss1{Delta} cells to DPC inducing agents by favoring alternate repair pathways. We provide evidence for cooperation of Ubx5-Cdc48 and Wss1 in the genotoxin-induced degradation of RNAPII, a described candidate substrate of Wss1. We propose that Ubx5-Cdc48 assists Wss1 for proteolysis of a subset of DNA-bound proteins. Together, our findings reveal a central role for Ubx5 in DPC clearance and repair.",

    "abstract": "UHRF1-dependent ubiquitin signaling plays an integral role in the regulation of maintenance DNA methylation. UHRF1 catalyzes transient dual mono-ubiquitylation of PAF15 (PAF15Ub2), which regulates the localization and activation of DNMT1 at DNA methylation sites during DNA replication. Although the initiation of UHRF1-mediated PAF15 ubiquitin signaling has been relatively well characterized, mechanisms underlying its termination and how they are coordinated with the completion of maintenance DNA methylation have not yet been clarified. This study shows that deubiquitylation by USP7 and unloading by ATAD5 (ELG1 in yeast) are pivotal processes for the removal of PAF15 from chromatin. On replicating chromatin, USP7 specifically interacts with PAF15Ub2 in a complex with DNMT1. USP7 depletion or inhibition of the interaction between USP7 and PAF15 results in abnormal accumulation of PAF15Ub2 on chromatin. Furthermore, we also find that the non-ubiquitylated form of PAF15 (PAF15Ub0) is removed from chromatin in an ATAD5-dependent manner. PAF15Ub2 was retained at high levels on chromatin when the catalytic activity of DNMT1 was inhibited, suggesting that the completion of maintenance DNA methylation is essential for termination of UHRF1-mediated ubiquitin signaling. This finding provides a molecular understanding of how the maintenance DNA methylation machinery is disassembled at the end of the S phase.",

    "abstract": "Despite ongoing efforts to control malaria infection, progress in lowering the number of deaths and infections appears to have stalled. The continued high incidence of malaria infection and mortality is in part due to emergence of parasites resistant to frontline antimalarials. This highlights the need for continued identification of novel protein drug targets. Mitochondrial functions in Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest species of human malaria parasite, are targets of validated antimalarials including atovaquone and proguanil (Malarone). Thus, there has been great interest in identifying other essential mitochondrial proteins as candidates for novel drug targets. Garnering an increased understanding of the proteomic landscape inside the P. falciparum mitochondrion will also allow us to learn about the basic biology housed within this unique organelle. We employed a proximity biotinylation technique and mass spectrometry to identify novel P. falciparum proteins putatively targeted to the mitochondrion. We fused the leader sequence of a mitochondrially targeted chaperone, Hsp60, to the promiscuous biotin ligase TurboID. Through these experiments, we generated a list of 122 \"putative mitochondrial\" proteins. To verify whether these proteins were indeed mitochondrial, we chose five candidate proteins of interest for localization studies using ectopic expression and tagging of each full-length protein. This allowed us to localize four candidate proteins of unknown function to the mitochondrion, three of which have previously been assessed to be essential. We suggest that phenotypic characterization of these and other proteins from this list of 122 could be fruitful in understanding the basic mitochondrial biology of these parasites and aid antimalarial drug discovery efforts.",

    "abstract": "KIF1A is a highly processive vesicle transport motor in the kinesin-3 family. Mutations in KIF1A lead to neurodegenerative diseases including hereditary spastic paraplegia. We applied optical tweezers to study the ability of KIF1A to generate and sustain force against hindering loads. We used both the three-bead assay, where force is oriented parallel to the microtubule, and the traditional single-bead assay, where force is directed along the radius of the bead, resulting in a vertical force component. The average force and attachment duration of KIF1A in the three-bead assay were substantially greater than those observed in the single-bead assay. Thus, vertical forces accelerate termination of force ramps of KIF1A. Average KIF1A termination forces were slightly lower than the kinesin-1 KIF5B, and the median attachment duration of KIF1A was >10-fold shorter than KIF5B under hindering loads. KIF1A rapidly reengages with microtubules after detachment, as observed previously. Strikingly, quantification enabled by the three-bead assay shows that reengagement largely occurs within 2 ms of detachment, indicating that KIF1A has a nearly tenfold faster reengagement rate than KIF5B. We found that rapid microtubule reengagement is not due to KIF1As positively charged loop-12; however, removal of charge from this loop diminished the unloaded run length at near physiological ionic strength. Both loop-12 and the microtubule nucleotide state have modulatory effects on reengagement under load, suggesting a role for the microtubule lattice in KIF1A reengagement. Our results reveal adaptations of KIF1A that lead to a novel model of super-engaging transport under load.",

    "abstract": "Decidualisation is the hormone-dependent process of endometrial remodelling that is essential for fertility and reproductive health. It is characterised by dynamic changes in the endometrial stromal compartment including differentiation of fibroblasts, immune cell trafficking and vascular remodelling. Deficits in decidualisation are implicated in disorders of pregnancy such as implantation failure, intra-uterine growth restriction, and pre-eclampsia.\n\nAndrogens are key regulators of decidualisation that promote optimal differentiation of stromal fibroblasts and activation of downstream signalling pathways required for endometrial remodelling. We have shown that androgen biosynthesis, via 5-reductase-dependent production of dihydrotestosterone, is required for optimal decidualisation of human stromal fibroblasts in vitro, but whether this is required for decidualisation in vivo has not been tested.\n\nIn the current study we used steroid 5-reductase type 1 (SRD5A1) deficient mice (Srd5a1-/- mice) and a validated model of induced decidualisation to investigate the role of SRD5A1 and intracrine androgen signalling in endometrial decidualisation. We measured decidualisation response (weight/proportion), transcriptomic changes, and morphological and functional parameters of vascular development. These investigations revealed a striking effect of 5-reductase deficiency on the decidualisation response. Furthermore, vessel permeability and transcriptional regulation of angiogenesis signalling pathways, particularly those that involved vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), were disrupted in the absence of 5-reductase. In Srd5a1-/- mice, injection of dihydrotestosterone co-incident with decidualisation restored decidualisation responses, vessel permeability, and expression of angiogenesis genes to wild type levels.\n\nAndrogen availability declines with age which may contribute to age-related risk of pregnancy disorders. These findings show that intracrine androgen signalling is required for optimal decidualisation in vivo and confirm a major role for androgens in the development of the vasculature during decidualisation through regulation of the VEGF pathway. These findings highlight new opportunities for improving age-related deficits in fertility and pregnancy health by targeting androgen-dependent signalling in the endometrium.",

    "abstract": "Multistability is central to biological systems as it plays a key role in adaptation, evolvability, and differentiation. Multistability can be achieved by integrating positive feedback loops into the regulation. The simplest of such feedback loops are a) a mutual inhibition (MI) loop, b) a mutual activation (MA) loop, and, c) self-activation. While it is established that all three motifs can give rise to bistability, the characteristic differences in the bistability exhibited by each of these motifs is relatively less understood. Here, we use ODE-based simulations across a large ensemble of parameter sets and initial conditions to study the characteristics of the bistability of these motifs and their limits in the parameter space. We also examine the behavior of these motifs under mutual degradation and self-activation. Finally, we investigate the utility of these motifs for achieving coordinated expression through cyclic and parallel coupling. Through our analysis, we found that MI-based architectures offer robustness in maintaining distinct multistability and allow for coordination among multiple genes. This coordination paves way for understanding the naturally occurring gene regulatory network and may also help in the better design of robust and controllable synthetic networks.",

Our data revealed a strong immune reconstitution in CCST mice, with T cells originating from CD34+ progenitor cells, proliferating efficiently in response to mitogenic stimulation ex vivo and capable of rejecting allogeneic human leukemic cells in vivo. Despite having less T cells than BLT mice, CCST mice were equally susceptible to mucosal or intraperitoneal HIV infection. Importantly, HIV-specific T cell responses were significantly higher in CCST-mice (median: 10.4% vs. 0.7%; p<0.0001 for CD8+cells and 3.9% vs. 0.7%; p<0.01 for CD4+ cells). As well, antiretroviral therapy (ART) robustly suppressed viremia and reduced the frequencies of cells carrying integrated HIV DNA by up to 2 logs in various CCST mouse tissues. As in BLT mice, we observed a complete viral rebound in 67% of the animals by 2-4 weeks following ART interruption, suggesting the presence of HIV reservoirs.

    "abstract": "CRISPR-mediated interference relies on complementarity between a guiding CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and target nucleic acids to provide defense against bacteriophage. Phages escape CRISPR-based immunity mainly through mutations in the PAM and seed regions. However, previous specificity studies of Cas effectors, including the class 2 endonuclease Cas12a, have revealed a high degree of tolerance of single mismatches. The effect of this mismatch tolerance has not been extensively studied in the context of phage defense. Here, we tested defense against lambda phage provided by Cas12a-crRNAs containing pre-existing mismatches against the genomic targets in phage DNA. We observe a correlation between Cas12a mismatch tolerance in vitro and phage defense on solid media. However, in liquid media, we find that most pre-existing crRNA mismatches lead to phage escape and lysis, regardless of whether the mismatches ablate Cas12a cleavage in vitro. We used high-throughput sequencing to examine the target regions of phage genomes following CRISPR challenge. Mismatches at all locations in the target accelerated emergence of mutant phage, including mismatches that greatly slowed cleavage in vitro. Mutations arose near the existing mismatch, in some cases resulting in multiple PAM-distal mismatches allowing for phage escape. Similar experiments with Cas9 showed the location of emergent target mutations was unaffected by pre-existing crRNA-target mismatches. Expression of multiple mismatched crRNAs prevented new mutations from arising in multiple targeted locations, allowing Cas12a mismatch tolerance to provide stronger and longer term protection. These results demonstrate that Cas effector mismatch tolerance and existing target mismatches strongly influence phage evolution.",

    "abstract": "Cystic Fibrosis is a heritable disease that causes altered physiology at mucosal sites; these changes result in chronic infection in the lung, significant gastrointestinal complications as well as dysbiosis of the gut microbiome, although the latter has been less well explored. Here, we describe the longitudinal development of the gut microbiome in a cohort of children with cystic fibrosis (cwCF) from birth through early childhood (0-4 years of age) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of stool samples as a surrogate for the gut microbiota. Similar to healthy populations, alpha diversity of the gut microbiome increases significantly with age, but diversity plateaus [~]2 years of age for this CF cohort. Several taxa that have been associated with dysbiosis in CF change with age towards a more healthy-like composition; notable exceptions include Akkermansia, which decreases with age, and Blautia, which increases with age. We also examined the relative abundance and prevalence of nine taxa associated with CF lung disease, several of which persist across early life, highlighting the possibility of the lung being seeded directly from the gut early in life. Finally, we applied the Crohns dysbiosis index to each sample, and found that high Crohns-associated dysbiosis early in life (<2 years) was associated with significantly lower Bacteroides in samples collected from 2-4 years of age. Together, these data indicate a persisting dysbiosis in the gut microbiota as well as markers associated with inflammatory bowel disease early in life for cwCF.\n\nIMPORTANCECystic Fibrosis is a heritable disease that disrupts ion transport at mucosal surfaces, causing a buildup of mucus and dysregulation of microbial communities in both the lungs and the intestines. Persons with CF are known to have dysbiotic gut microbial communities, but the development of these communities over time beginning at birth have not been thoroughly studied. Here, we describe the development of the gut microbiome of cwCF throughout the first four years of life, during the critical window of both gut microbiome and immune development. Our findings indicate a persisting dysbiosis, the possibility of the gut microbiota as a reservoir of airway pathogens and a surprisingly early indication of a microbiota associated with inflammatory bowel disease.",

    "abstract": "The pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has resulted in over 500 million infections and more than six million deaths worldwide. Although the viral genomes of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 share high sequence homology, the clinical and pathological features of COVID-19 differ profoundly from those of SARS. It is apparent that changes in viral genes contribute to the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and pathology of COVID-19.\n\nCytotoxic T lymphocytes play a key role in the elimination of virus-infected cells, mediated by recognition of virus-derived peptides that are presented on MHC class I molecules. Here, we show that SARS-CoV-2 can interfere with antigen presentation thereby evading immune surveillance. SARS-CoV-2 infection of monkey and human cell lines resulted in reduced cell-surface expression of MHC class I molecules. We identified a single viral gene product, the accessory factor open reading frame 7a (ORF7a), that mediates this effect. ORF7a interacts with HLA class I molecules in the ER, resulting in ER retention or impaired HLA heavy chain (HC) trafficking to the Golgi. Ultimately, these actions result in reduced HLA class I surface expression on infected cells. Whereas ORF7a from SARS-CoV-2 reduces surface HLA class I levels, the homologous ORF7a from the 2002 pandemic SARS-CoV-1 did not, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a acquired the ability to downregulate HLA-I during evolution of the virus. We identified a single amino acid in the SARS-CoV-1 ORF7a luminal domain that, upon mutating to the corresponding SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a sequence, induced a gain-of-function in HLA surface downregulation. By abrogating HLA class I antigen presentation via ORF7a, SARS-CoV-2 may evade host immune responses by inhibiting anti-viral cytotoxic T cell activity, thereby contributing to the pathology of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Members of microbial communities interact via a plethora of mechanisms, including resource competition, cross-feeding, and pH modulation. However, the relative contributions of these mechanisms to community dynamics remain uncharacterized. Here, we develop a framework to distinguish the effects of resource competition from other interaction mechanisms by integrating data from growth measurements in spent media, synthetic community assembly, and metabolomics with consumer-resource models. When applied to human gut commensals, our framework revealed that resource competition alone could explain most pairwise interactions. The resource-competition landscape inferred from metabolomic profiles of individual species predicted assembly compositions, demonstrating that resource competition is a dominant driver of in vitro community assembly. Moreover, the identification and incorporation of interactions other than resource competition, including pH-mediated effects and cross-feeding, improved model predictions. Our work provides an experimental and modeling framework to characterize and quantify interspecies interactions in vitro that should advance mechanistically principled engineering of microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Arrhenotoky is typical mode of reproduction for Hymenoptera - females originate from fertilized eggs, males from unfertilized eggs. However, some lineages of Hymenoptera have switched to thelytoky, where diploid females originate instead from unfertilized diploid eggs. In the contras with some other hymenopteran lineages, thelytoky is generally very rare in bees.\n\nHere, we examined reproduction in the small carpenter bee Ceratina dallatoreana, which is assumed to be thelytokous. We compared genotype of microsatellite loci between mothers and their offspring. Offspring were genetically identical with mother in all cases. We did not detect any male offspring. Therefore, we conclude that parthenogeny is the prevailing, and perhaps obligate, mode of reproduction in C. dallatoreana. Offspring were clones of their mother with no observed decrease of heterozygosity. Thus the cytological mode of parthenogenesis is apomixis, or automimic with central fusion and extremely reduced or non-existing recombination.\n\nCeratina bees are originally facultatively eusocial, therefore thelytoky may influence social evolution by causing extremely high within-colony relatedness. However, to date no multifemale nests have been recorded in C. dallatoreana.",

    "abstract": "Pompe disease (PD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficient lysosomal acid -glucosidase (GAA), leading to reduced degradation and subsequent accumulation of intra-lysosomal glycogen in tissues, especially skeletal and oftentimes cardiac muscle. The c.1935C>A (p.Asp645Glu) variant is the most frequent GAA pathogenic mutation in people of Taiwanese and Southern Chinese ethnicity, causing infantile-onset PD (IOPD), which presents neonatally with severe hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, profound muscle hypotonia, and respiratory failure leading to premature death if untreated.\n\nTo further investigate the pathogenic mechanism and facilitate development of therapies pertaining to this variant, we applied CRISPR-Cas9 homology-directed repair (HDR) using a novel dual sgRNA approach flanking the target site to generate a GaaEm1935C>A knock-in mouse model as well as a myoblast cell line carrying the Gaa c.1935C>A mutation. Herein we describe the molecular, biochemical, physiological, histological, and behavioral characterization of 3-month-old homozygous GaaEm1935C>A mice.\n\nHomozygous GaaEm1935C>A knock-in mice exhibited normal Gaa mRNA expression levels relative to wild-type mice, but GAA enzymatic activity was almost completely abolished, leading to a substantial increase in tissue glycogen storage, and significant concomitant impairment of autophagy. Echocardiography of 3-month-old knock-in mice revealed significant cardiac hypertrophy. The mice also demonstrated skeletal muscle weakness but, paradoxically, not early mortality. Longitudinal studies of this model, including assessment of its immune response to exogenously supplied GAA enzyme, are currently underway.\n\nIn summary, the GaaEm1935C>A knock-in mouse model recapitulates the molecular, biochemical, histopathologic, and phenotypic aspects of human IOPD caused by the GAA c.1935C>A pathogenic variant. It is an ideal model to assess innovative therapies to treat IOPD, including personalized therapeutic strategies that correct pathogenic variants, restore GAA activity and produce functional phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Inference and analysis of cellular biological networks requires software tools that integrate multi-omic data from various sources. The Network Zoo (netZoo; netzoo.github.io) is an open-source software suite to model biological networks, including context-specific gene regulatory networks and multi-omics partial correlation networks, to conduct differential analyses, estimate community structure, and model the transitions between biological states. The netZoo builds on our ongoing development of network methods, harmonizing the implementations in various computing languages (R, Python, MATLAB, and C) and between methods to allow a better integration of these tools into analytical pipelines. To demonstrate the value of this integrated toolkit, we analyzed the multi-omic data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) by inferring gene regulatory networks for each cancer cell line and associating network features with other phenotypic attributes such as drug sensitivity. This allowed us to identify transcription factors that play a critical role in both drug resistance and cancer development in melanoma. We also used netZoo to build a pan-cancer, multi-tiered CCLE map and used it to identify known metabolic hallmarks of cancer and to estimate novel context-specific elements that mediate post-transcriptional regulation. Because the netZoo tools are open-source and there is a growing community of both users and developers, we built an ecosystem to support community contributions, share use cases, and visualize networks online. As additional data types become available and our suite of methods grows, we will expand \"the zoo\" to incorporate an increasingly sophisticated collection of tools for network inference and analysis.",

    "abstract": "Mouse is probably the most important model organism to study mammal biology and human diseases. A better understanding of the mouse genome will help understand the human genome, biology and diseases. However, despite the recent progress, characterization of the regulatory sequences in the mouse genome is still far from complete, limiting its use to understand the regulatory sequences in the human genome. Here, by integrating binding peaks in 9,060 transcription factor (TF) ChIP-seq datasets that cover 79.9% of the mouse mappable genome using an efficient pipeline, we were able to partition these binding peak-covered genome regions into a cis-regulatory module (CRM) candidate (CRMC) set and a non-CRMC sets. The CRMCs contain 912,197 putative CRMs and 38,554,729 TF binding sites (TFBSs) islands, covering 55.5% and 24.4% of the mappable genome, respectively. The CRMCs tend to be under strongly evolutionary constraints, indicating that they are likely cis-regulatory; while the non-CRMCs are largely selectively neutral, indicating that they are unlikely cis-regulatory. Based on evolutionary profiles of the genome positions, we further estimated that 63.8% and 27.4% of the mouse genome might code for CRMs and TFBSs, respectively. Validation using experimental data suggests that at least most of the CRMCs are authentic. Thus, this unprecedentedly comprehensive map of CRMs and TFBSs can be a good resource to guide experimental studies of regulatory genomes in mice and humans.",

    "abstract": "RNA molecules undergo a number of chemical modifications whose effects can alter their structure and molecular interactions. Previous studies have shown that RNA editing can impact the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes and influence the assembly of membrane-less organelles such as stress-granules. For instance, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) enhances SG formation and N1-methyladenosine (m1A) prevents their transition to solid-like aggregates. Yet, very little is known about adenosine to inosine (A-to-I) modification that is very abundant in human cells and not only impacts mRNAs but also non-coding RNAs. Here, we built the CROSSalive predictor of A-to-I effects on RNA structure based on high-throughput in-cell experiments. Our method shows an accuracy of 90% in predicting the single and double-stranded content of transcripts and identifies a general enrichment of double-stranded regions caused by A-to-I in long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs). For the individual cases of NEAT1, NORAD and XIST, we investigated the relationship between A-to-I editing and interactions with RNA-binding proteins using available CLIP data. We found that A-to-I editing is linked to alteration of interaction sites with proteins involved in phase-separation, which suggests that RNP assembly can be influenced by A-to-I.

    "abstract": "Progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD) is a photoreceptor outer segment (POS) disc-specific protein essential for maintaining outer segment (OS) structures, while also contributing to rhodopsin packaging densities and distribution in the disc membranes. Previously, we showed PRCD undergoing palmitoylation at the sole cysteine (Cys2), where a mutation is found linked with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) that is crucial for protein stability and trafficking to POS. PRCD has several predicted structural domains with unknown significance, such as the polybasic region (PBR) where an Arg17Cys (R17C) mutation is linked with RP. In this study, we demonstrate that a mutation in the PBR augments additional palmitoyl lipid modification observed through acyl-RAC in the mutant cysteine (R17C). Immunolocalization of transiently expressed R17C protein in hRPE1 cells depicts similar characteristics to wild type (WT); however, a double mutant lacking endogenous palmitoylation at the Cys2 position is comparable to the C2Y protein as both are likely aggregated and mislocalized in the mitochondria. Subretinal injection of C2Y, R17C, and R17C/C2Y mutants followed by electroporation in murine retina exhibit mislocalization in the inner segment compared to WT PRCD. Our results in the R17C mutant show palmitoylation transpires at two different locations. Despite being dually palmitoylated and demonstrating membrane association, the mutation in the PBR affects protein stability and trafficking to the OS. Moreover, palmitoylation within the PBR alone does not compensate for protein stability or trafficking, revealing the PBR domain is indispensable and any defects likely lead to dysregulation of PRCD protein associated with blinding diseases.",

The ability of G{beta}{gamma} to regulate these processes is unknown. To investigate the feasibility of this mechanism to inhibit SNARE function more broadly, we utilized a series of biochemical assays of binding and function with four Qa-SNAREs (Stx1A, Stx2, Stx3, and Stx4) and four Qb,c-SNAREs (SNAP25, SNAP23, SNAP29, and SNAP47) in tandem with the R-SNARE synaptobrevin, synaptotagmin I, and G{beta}{gamma}. G{beta}{gamma} was found to bind to multiple Qa-SNARE isoforms as well as SNAP23, and inhibit the lipid mixing function of these SNAREs, as well as SNAP29. Together, this data suggests a more broad role for the G{beta}{gamma}-SNARE pathway in the regulation of exocytosis beyond cells that express Stx1A or SNAP25.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation in CRISPR-Cas systems immunizes bacteria and archaea against mobile genetic elements. In many DNA-targeting systems, the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 complex is required for selection and processing of DNA segments containing PAM sequences, prior to integration of these \"prespacer\" substrates as spacers in the CRISPR array. We determined cryo-EM structures of the Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 adaptation complex from the type I-C system that encodes standalone Cas1 and Cas4 proteins. The structures reveal how Cas4 specifically reads out bases within the PAM sequence and how interactions with both Cas1 and Cas2 activate Cas4 endonuclease activity. The Cas4-PAM interaction ensures tight binding between the adaptation complex and the prespacer, significantly enhancing integration of the non-PAM end into the CRISPR array and ensuring correct spacer orientation. Corroborated with our biochemical results, Cas4-Cas1-Cas2 structures with substrates representing various stages of CRISPR adaptation reveal a temporally resolved mechanism for maturation and integration of functional spacers into the CRISPR array.",

    "abstract": "The ring model (Haering et al. 2002) proposes that sister chromatid cohesion is mediated by co-entrapment of sister DNAs inside a tripartite cohesin ring created by a pair of rod-shaped proteins (Smc1 and Smc3) whose two ends are connected through dimerization of their hinges at one end and by association of their ATPase domains at the other end with the N- and C-terminal domains of a kleisin subunit (Scc1). The model explains how Scc1 cleavage triggers anaphase (Uhlmann, Lottspeich, and Nasmyth 1999) but has hitherto only been rigorously tested using small circular mini-chromosomes in yeast, where crosslinking the rings three interfaces, creating a covalent circular molecule, induces catenation of individual sister DNAs (Haering et al. 2008; Srinivasan et al. 2018). If the model applies to real chromatids, then the ring must have a DNA entry gate essential for mitosis. Whether this is situated at the Smc3/Scc1 (Murayama and Uhlmann 2015; Murayama et al. 2018) or Smc1/Smc3 hinge (Gruber et al. 2006) interface is an open question. Using an in vitro system (Collier et al. 2020), we show that cohesin in fact possesses two DNA gates, one at the Smc3/Scc1 interface and a second at the Smc1/3 hinge. Unlike the Smc3/Scc1 interface, passage of DNAs through SMC hinges depends on both Scc2 and Scc3, a pair of regulatory subunits necessary for entrapment in vivo (Srinivasan et al. 2018). This property together with the lethality caused by locking this interface but not that between Smc3 and Scc1 in vivo (Gruber et al. 2006) suggests that passage of DNAs through the hinge is essential for building sister chromatid cohesion. Passage of DNAs through the Smc3/Scc1 interface is necessary for cohesins separase-independent release from chromosomes (Chan et al. 2012) and may therefore largely serve as an exit gate.",

    "abstract": "MotivationBeing able to artificially design novel proteins of desired function is pivotal in many biological and biomedical applications. Generative statistical modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm for designing amino acid sequences, including in particular models and embedding methods borrowed from Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, most approaches target single proteins or protein domains, and do not take into account any functional specificity or interaction with the context. To extend beyond current computational strategies, we develop a method for generating protein domain sequences intended to interact with another protein domain. Using data from natural multi-domain proteins, we cast the problem as a translation problem from a given interactor domain to the new domain to be generated, i.e. we generate artificial partner sequences conditional on an input sequence.\n\nResultsEvaluating our models quality using diverse metrics, in part related to distinct biological questions, we show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art shallow auto-regressive strategies. We also explore the possibility of fine-tuning pre-trained large language models for the same task and of using Alphafold 2 for assessing the quality of sampled sequences.",

    "abstract": "The mechanisms underlying how individual mutations affect the protein energy landscape are crucial for understanding how proteins evolve. However, predicting mutational effects remains challenging because of epistasis--the nonadditive interactions between mutations. Here, we investigate the biophysical mechanism of strain-specific epistasis in the nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) of the influenza A virus (IAV). To understand the molecular basis of epistasis, we conducted comprehensive analyses of four NS1s of IAV strains that emerged between 1918 and 2004. We find that strain-specific mutations of NS1s are near-neutral with respect to the association with the p85{beta} subunit of PI3K. However, the individual residues on the p85{beta}-binding interface show long-range epistatic interactions with strain-specific mutations. We reveal that strain-specific mutations reshaped the energy landscape of NS1, leading to long-range epistasis. Our findings offer a high-resolution mechanism of how near-neutral mutations silently alter the biophysical energy landscapes, resulting in diverse background effects during molecular evolution.",

Metastatic spreading is promoted by cancer cell plasticity, yet its regulation by the microenvironment is incompletely understood. Here we show that the presence of hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein-1 (HAPLN1) in the extracellular matrix enhances tumor cell plasticity and PDAC metastasis. Bioinformatic analysis showed that HAPLN1 expression is enriched in the basal PDAC subtype and associated with worse overall patient survival. In a mouse model for peritoneal carcinomatosis, HAPLN1-induced immunomodulation favored a more permissive microenvironment, which accelerated the peritoneal spread of tumor cells. Mechanistically, HAPLN1, via hyaluronic acid synthesis and signaling, promoted adoption of a highly plastic cancer cell state, facilitating EMT, stemness, invasion and immunomodulation in a paracrine manner. Extracellular HAPLN1 modifies cancer cells as well as fibroblasts, rendering them immunomodulatory. We identify HAPLN1 as a prognostic marker and a driver for peritoneal metastasis in PDAC.",

    "abstract": "Camelina is being developed as a winter oilseed cover crop. Early flowering and maturity are desired traits in camelina to allow for relay planting or seeding of a summer annual following camelina harvest. Here we report that while all winter biotype accessions of camelina have a functional allele of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) on chromosome 20, there are also at least 20 previously characterized spring biotype accessions that have a functional FLC allele at this locus. We observed this by analyzing 75 accessions (67 spring type, one facultative, and seven winter type) that were resequenced by Li et al., (2020) as well as 21 additional accessions for this analysis. This discovery will inform marker assisted selection efforts that are underway to increase genetic variation in the genetically narrow base of winter camelina germplasm. Furthermore, we optimized a KASP genotyping approach that effectively differentiates the presence of either the functional or subfunctional FLC allele on chromosome 20. These analyses identified a facultative winter biotype accession of camelina (PI650163-1, winter hardy with subfunctional chromosome 20 FLC allele) that has demonstrated two years of winter-hardiness and has flowered at least a week earlier than the common winter accession,  Joelle. A bioinformatics approach to cytotype analysis in camelina also provided more precise categorizing of camelina accessions in the USDA-NPGS germplasm into 2n=38 and 2n=40 cytotypes. Early maturing winter-hardy camelina will reduce stress on a subsequent soybean crop and improve total cropping system yields when camelina and soybean are grown sequentially in the same season on the same land.",

    "abstract": "Plant immunity relies on the perception of Microbe-Associate Molecular Patterns (MAMPs) from invading microbes to induce defense responses that suppress attempted infections. It has been proposed that MAMP-triggered immunity (MTI) suppresses bacterial infections by suppressing the onset of bacterial virulence. However, the mechanisms by which plants exert this action are poorly understood. Here we uncover that MAMP-perception in Arabidopsis induces the accumulation of free amino acids (AA) in a salicylic acid (SA) dependent manner. When co-infiltrated with Glutamine and Serine, two of the MAMP-induced highly accumulating amino acids, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 expressed low levels of virulence genes and failed to produce robust infections in otherwise susceptible plants. When applied exogenously, Glutamine and Serine suppressed bacterial virulence and bacterial growth directly without the need for MAMP-perception and SA-signaling, bypassing MAMP-elicited defense. In addition, an increased level of endogenous Glutamine in the leaf apoplast of a gain-of-function mutant of Glutamine Dumper-1 rescued the partially compromised bacterial virulence and growth suppressing phenotype of the SA-induced deficient-2 (sid2) mutant. Our data suggest that MTI suppresses bacterial infections by the direct suppressing effect of accumulating amino acids on the onset of bacterial virulence.",

    "abstract": "To characterize the process of visual search, reaction time is measured relative to stimulus onset, when the whole search field is presented in view simultaneously. Salient objects are found faster, suggesting that they are detected using peripheral vision (rather than each object being fixated in turn). This work investigated how objects are detected in the periphery when onset in the visual field is due to head movement. Is the process of target detection similarly affected by salience? We test this in 360 degree view with free head and eye movement, using a virtual reality headset with eye tracking. We presented letters and Gabor patches as stimuli in separate experiments. Four clusters were arranged horizontally such that two clusters were visible at onset either side of a fixation cross (near location) while the other two entered the field of view (FoV) when the participant made an appropriate head movement (far location). In both experiments we varied whether the target was less or more salient. We found an interesting discrepancy in that across both tasks and locations the first eye movement to land near a cluster was closer to the salient target, even though salience did not lead to a faster head movement towards a cluster at the far locations. We also found that the planning of head movement changed the landing of gaze position to be targeted more towards the centres of the clusters at the far locations, leading to more accurate initial gaze positions relative to target, regardless of salience. This suggests that the spatial information available for targeting of eye movements within a given FoV is not always available for the planning of head movements and how a target appears in view affects gaze targeting accuracy.",

Here, we demonstrate that patients suffering from anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) showed increased activity of the DNA sensor cGAS and enhanced IFN-I signature. To identify potential therapeutic targets, we developed a mouse model for pulmonary AAV that mimics severe disease in patients. Immunogenic DNA accumulated during disease onset, triggering cGAS/STING/IRF3-dependent IFN-I release that promoted endothelial damage, pulmonary hemorrhages, and lung dysfunction. Macrophage subsets played dichotomic roles in disease. While recruited monocyte-derived macrophages were major disease drivers by producing most IFN-{beta}, resident alveolar macrophages contributed to tissue homeostasis by clearing red blood cells and limiting infiltration of IFN-{beta}-producing macrophages. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of STING, IFNAR-I or its downstream JAK/STAT signaling reduced disease severity and accelerated recovery.

    "abstract": "Many aspects of eukaryotic physiology are regulated by calcium ions (Ca2+). Whether bacteria have similar Ca2+ systems for transport, storage, binding, and response to Ca2+ is not well understood. To identify components of Ca2+ signaling in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we determined its transcriptional response to Ca2+. Overall, only few genes changed expression, suggesting a limited role of Ca2+ as a transcriptional regulator. However, two of the most strongly downregulated genes were the pe15 and ppe20 genes that code for members of a large family of proteins that localizes to the outer membrane. PE15 and PPE20 formed a complex and PPE20 directly bound Ca2+. Ca2+-associated phenotypes such as an increase in ATP consumption and increase in biofilm formation were reversed in a pe15/ppe20 knockout strain, suggesting a direct role in Ca2+ homeostasis. To test whether the complex has a role in Ca2+ transport across the outer membrane, we created a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based Ca2+ reporter strain. A pe15/ppe20 knockout in the FRET background showed a specific and selective loss of Ca2+ influx that was dependent on the presence of an intact outer cell wall. These data show that PE15/PPE20 form a Ca2+-binding protein complex that selectively imports Ca2+ and support the emerging idea of a general family-wide role of PE/PPE proteins in transport across the outer membrane.",

    "abstract": "Reticular adhesions (RAs) consist of integrin v{beta}5 and harbor flat clathrin lattices (FCLs), long-lasting structures with similar molecular composition to clathrin mediated endocytosis (CME) carriers. Why FCLs and RAs colocalize is not known. Here, we show that FCLs assemble RAs in a process controlled by fibronectin (FN) and its receptor, integrin v{beta}5. We observed that cells on FN-rich matrices displayed fewer FCLs and RAs. CME machinery inhibition abolished RAs and live-cell imaging showed that RA establishment requires FCL co-assembly. The inhibitory activity of FN was mediated by the activation of integrin 5{beta}1 at Tensin1-positive fibrillar adhesions. Conventionally, endocytosis disassembles cellular adhesions by internalization of their components. Our results present a novel paradigm in the relationship between these two processes by showing that endocytic proteins can actively function in the assembly of cell adhesions. Furthermore, we show this novel adhesion assembly mechanism is coupled to cell migration via a unique crosstalk between cell matrix adhesions.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the chromatin remodeling factor CHD7 are the predominant cause of CHARGE syndrome, a congenital disorder that frequently includes ocular coloboma. Although CHD7 is known to be required for proper ocular morphogenesis, its role in retinal development has not been thoroughly investigated. Given that individuals with CHARGE syndrome can experience visual impairment even in the absence of coloboma, a better understanding of CHD7 function in the retina is needed. In this study, we characterized the expression pattern of Chd7 in the developing zebrafish and mouse retina and documented ocular and retinal phenotypes in Chd7 loss-of-function mutants. Zebrafish Chd7 was expressed throughout the retinal neuroepithelium when retinal progenitor cells were actively proliferating, and later in subsets of newly post-mitotic retinal cells. At stages of retinal development when most retinal cell types had terminally differentiated, Chd7 expression remained strong in the ganglion cell layer and in some cells in the inner nuclear layer. Intriguingly, strong expression of Chd7 was also observed in the outer nuclear layer where it was co-expressed with markers of post-mitotic cone and rod photoreceptors. Expression of mouse CHD7 displayed a similar pattern, including expression in the ganglion cells, subsets of inner nuclear layer cells, and in the distal outer nuclear layer as late as P15. Two different mutant chd7 zebrafish lines were characterized for ocular and retinal defects. These mutants displayed microphthalmia, reduced numbers of cone photoreceptors, and truncated rod and cone photoreceptor outer segments. Reduced cone photoreceptor number and abnormal outer segments were also observed in heterozygous Chd7 mutant mice. Taken together, our results in zebrafish and mouse reveal a conserved, previously undescribed role for Chd7 in retinal development and photoreceptor outer segment morphogenesis. Moreover, our work suggests an avenue of future investigation into the pathogenesis of visual system defects in CHARGE syndrome.\n\nHighlightsO_LIChd7 is expressed in both retinal progenitor cells and in differentiated retinal neurons, including post-mitotic rod and cone photoreceptors.\nC_LIO_LILoss of Chd7 results in a significant decrease in cone photoreceptors in both zebrafish and mouse.\nC_LIO_LICone and rod photoreceptor outer segments are truncated in chd7 mutants, suggesting a heretofore unappreciated role for Chd7 in outer segment morphogenesis.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the PQBP1 gene (polyglutamine-binding protein 1) are responsible for a syndromic X-linked form of intellectual disability (XLID), the Renpenning syndrome. PQBP1 encodes a protein that plays a role in the regulation of gene expression, splicing and mRNA translation. To investigate the consequences of variants in PQBP1, we performed transcriptomic studies in 1) patients lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) carrying pathogenic variants in PQBP1 and 2) in human neural stem cells (hNSC) knocked-down (KD) for PQBP1. This led to the identification of a hundred dysregulated genes. In particular, we identified an increase in the expression of a non-canonical isoform of another XLID gene, UPF3B. UPF3B plays a crucial role during neurodevelopment by coding for an important actor of the nonsense mRNA mediated decay (NMD) system involved in regulation of protein translation, however, the exact function of the non-canonical isoform,UPF3B_S, is currently unknown. In order to investigate the role of UPF3B_S isoform, we compared the protein interactome of UPF3B_S to the canonical isoform (UPF3B_L). We confirmed that, on the contrary to UPF3B_L, UPF3B_S does not interact with the UPF2/UPF1 complex while it still interacts with exon junction complexes (EJC). However, no notable decrease of NMD pathways was observed in patients LCL or in hNSC KD for PQBP1. We identified several additional protein interactors specific to UPF3B_S. Moreover, we used the increase of UPF3B_S mRNA as a molecular marker to test the pathogenicity of variants of unknown clinical significance identified in individuals with ID in PQPB1. We analyzed patients LCL mRNA as well as blood mRNA samples and performed complementation studies in HeLa cells by overexpressing Wild-type and mutant PQBP1 cDNA. We showed that all these three approaches were efficient to test the effect of variants, at least for variants affecting the CTD domain of the protein. In conclusion, our study provides information on how PQBP1 deficiency may affect the expression of genes and isoforms, such as UPF3B. This informs about the pathological mechanisms involved in Renpenning syndrome but also allows to propose a functional test for variants of unknown significance identified in PQBP1.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant shifts in DNA methylation have long been regarded as an early marker for cancer onset and progression. To chart DNA methylation changes that occur during the transformation from normal healthy colon tissue to malignant colorectal cancer (CRC), we collected over 50 samples from 15 familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and non-FAP colorectal cancer patients, and generated 30-70x whole-genome methylation sequencing (WGMS) runs via the novel Ultima Genomics ultra high-throughput sequencing platform. We observed changes in DNA methylation that occur early in the malignant transformation process, in gene promoters and in distal regulatory elements. Among these changes are events of hyper-methylation which are associated with a bivalent \"poised\" chromatin state at promoters and are CRC-specific. Distal enhancers show nonlinear dynamics, lose methylation in the progression from normal mucosa to dysplastic polyps but regain methylation in the adenocarcinoma state. Enhancers that gain chromatin accessibility in the adenocarcinoma state and are enriched with HOX transcription factor binding sites, a marker of developmental genes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of generating large high quality WGMS data using the Ultima Genomics platform and provides the first detailed view of methylation dynamics during CRC formation and progression in a model case.",

    "abstract": "Prestin is a high-density motor protein in the outer hair cells (OHCs), whose conformational response to acoustic signals alters the shape of the cell, thereby playing a major role in sound amplification by the cochlea. Despite recent structural determination in active and inhibited states, the details of prestins intimate interactions with the membrane, which are central to its function remained unresolved. Here, employing a large set (collectively, more than 0.5 ms) of coarse-grained molecule dynamics simulations, we characterize the nature of prestins lipid-protein interactions, demonstrating their impact on the organization of prestin at densities relevant to the OHCs and its effectiveness in reshaping OHCs. Beyond local enrichment/depletion of various lipid types, prestin causes drastic anisotropic membrane deformation, which in turn mediates a preferential membrane organization of prestin in which deformation patterns by neighboring prestin copies are aligned constructively. The reduced membrane rigidity accompanying this arrangement is hypothesized to maximize the mechanical impact of prestin on OHC reshaping during cochlear sound amplification. Prestins preferential arrangement is further verified by extended simulations demonstrating strong correlation between prestin neighbors in their orientations. These results demonstrate a strong case of protein-protein cooperative communication in membrane, purely mediated by their interactions with lipids.",

However, approximately half of all patients who respond to CD19-directed cell therapy relapse, the majority within six months. One characteristic of relapse is loss or reduction of CD19 expression on malignant B cells. We designed a unique therapeutic to prevent and reverse relapses due to lost or reduced CD19 expression. This novel biologic, a CAR T Engager, binds CD20 and displays the CD19 extracellular domain. This approach increases the apparent CD19 antigen density on CD19-positive/CD20-positive lymphoma cells, and prevents CD19 antigen-oss induced relapse, as CD19 bound to CD20 remains present on the cell surface. We demonstrate that this novel therapeutic prevents and reverses lymphoma relapse in vitro and prevents CD19-negative lymphoma growth and relapse in vivo.",

This study aimed to compare the modified RNA isolation methods for higher RNA yield and quality from freshly ejaculated sperm of cattle and buffalo bull for further transcriptome analysis. Ten fresh ejaculates from each Sahiwal (n = 10 bulls x 10 ejaculates) and Murrah bulls (n = 10 bulls x 10 ejaculates) were used for RNA isolation. Swim-up technique was used for live sperm separation and recovery. From the recovered live sperm, total sperm RNA was isolated by conventional methods (TRIzol, Double TRIzol), membrane-based methods combined with TRIzol (RNeasy + TRIzol) with the addition of {beta}-mercaptoethanol (BME) and Kit (RNeasy mini) methods in fresh semen. Among different isolation methods; the membrane-based modified methods combined with TRIzol (RNeasy + TRIzol) with the addition of {beta}-mercaptoethanol (BME) resulted significantly (P < 0.05) higher total RNA quantity (300-340 ng/L) and better purity in different concentrations of spermatozoa viz., 30-40 million, 70-80 million and 300-400 million sperm. The study concluded that the inclusion of BME to the combined membrane-based methods with somatic cell lysis buffer solution was best for constant increased yield and purity of RNA isolation from Sahiwal cattle and Murrah buffalo bull sperm. This method will help with the interpretation of data from animal models and the consistency of clinical assessments of male factor fertility employing RNA molecular biomarkers.",

    "abstract": "South Korea is among the major producers of the Pacific oyster, Magallana gigas (Crassostrea gigas), which is one of the most valued aquaculture species. Since the early 1990s, climatic and anthropogenic factors have incurred the reduction of their wild seeds, whereby the dependence on hatchery-produced seeds has constantly increased in South Korea, thus raising concerns about losing genetic diversity and accelerating genetic deterioration. To better understand their genetic make-up, we assessed the genetic diversity of M. gigas populations from two farms (Tongyeong and Gadeokdo) in the southern coast, where about 80% of the cultivated oysters in Korea are produced. Tongyeong showed slightly higher diversity than Gadeokdo, but both populations had a similar genetic structure characterized by low nucleotide diversity. Comparative haplotype analyses provided data supporting unique genetic features of the populations that include (1) weak genotype-locality relationship, (2) low levels of gene flow between populations, and (3) seasonal fluctuation of genetic variation within a population. Furthermore, the highly alike haplotype network patterns were observed between the wild and farm populations as well as among the populations in neighboring countries, which suggests that the genetic structure is conserved between wild and hatchery populations, and geographic proximity has minimal influence on the genetic composition. These results warrant further study in biological and ecological contexts and will be invaluable in formulating genetic monitoring and sustainable long-term management of M. gigas.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been widely pursued as targets for anti-cancer therapeutics. However, many of these targets are universally essential for cell survival, which may limit the therapeutic window that can be achieved by drug candidates. By examining large collections of CRISPR/Cas9-based essentiality screens, we discovered a genetic interaction between HDAC1 and HDAC2 wherein each paralog is synthetically lethal with hemizygous deletion of the other. This collateral synthetic lethality is caused by recurrent chromosomal translocations that occur in diverse solid and hematological malignancies, including neuroblastoma and multiple myeloma. Using genetic deletion or dTAG-mediated degradation, we show that HDAC2 disruption suppresses the growth of HDAC1-deficient neuroblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that targeted degradation of HDAC2 in these cells prompts the degradation of several members of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, leading to diminished chromatin accessibility at HDAC2/NuRD-bound sites of the genome and impaired control of enhancer-associated transcription. Furthermore, we reveal that several of the degraded NuRD complex subunits are dependencies in neuroblastoma and multiple myeloma, providing motivation to develop paralog-selective HDAC1 or HDAC2 degraders. Altogether, we identify HDAC1/2 collateral synthetic lethality as a new therapeutic target and reveal a novel mechanism for exploiting NuRD-associated cancer dependencies.",

In addition to the classical first and second heart fields, we observed the appearance of juxta-cardiac field progenitors giving rise to both myocardial and epicardial cells.
