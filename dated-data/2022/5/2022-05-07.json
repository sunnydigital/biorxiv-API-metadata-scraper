    "abstract": "The origin, diversification, and secondary loss of sexually dimorphic characters are common in animal evolution. In some cases, structurally and functionally similar traits have evolved independently in multiple lineages. Prominent examples of such traits include the male-specific grasping structures that develop on the front legs of many dipteran insects. In this report, we describe the evolution and development of one of these structures, the male-specific \"sex brush\". The sex brush is composed of densely packed, irregularly arranged modified bristles and is found in several distantly related lineages in the family Drosophilidae. Phylogenetic analysis using 250 genes from over 200 species provides modest support for a single origin of the sex brush followed by many secondary losses; however, independent origins of the sex brush cannot be ruled out completely. We show that sex brushes develop in very similar ways in all brush-bearing lineages. The dense packing of brush hairs is explained by the specification of bristle precursor cells at a near-maximum density permitted by the lateral inhibition mechanism, as well as by the reduced size of the surrounding epithelial cells. In contrast to the female and the ancestral male condition, where bristles are arranged in stereotypical, precisely spaced rows, cell migration does not contribute appreciably to the formation of the sex brush. The complex phylogenetic history of the sex brush can make it a valuable model for investigating coevolution of sex-specific morphology and mating behavior.",

    "abstract": "To determine how much cognitive control to invest in a task, people need to consider whether exerting control matters for obtaining rewards. In particular, they need to account for the efficacy of their performance - the degree to which rewards are determined by performance or by independent factors. Yet it remains unclear how people learn about their performance efficacy in an environment. Here we combined computational modeling with measures of task performance and EEG, to provide a mechanistic account of how people (a) learn and update efficacy expectations in a changing environment, and (b) proactively adjust control allocation based on current efficacy expectations. Across two studies subjects performed an incentivized cognitive control task while their performance efficacy (the likelihood that rewards are performance- contingent or random) varied over time. We show that people update their efficacy beliefs based on prediction errors - leveraging similar neural and computational substrates as those that underpin reward learning - and adjust how much control they allocate according to these beliefs. Using computational modeling, we show that these control adjustments reflect changes in information processing, rather than the speed-accuracy tradeoff. These findings demonstrate the neurocomputational mechanism through which people learn how worthwhile their cognitive control is.",

    "abstract": "Animals with complex nervous systems demand sleep for memory consolidation and synaptic remodeling. Here we show that though the Caenorhabditis elegans nervous system has a limited number of neurons, sleep is necessary for both processes. In addition, it is unclear in any system if sleep collaborates with experience to alter synapses between specific neurons and whether this ultimately affects behavior. C. elegans neurons have defined connections and well-described contributions to behavior. We show that spaced odor-training and post-training sleep induce long-term memory. Memory consolidation, but not acquisition, requires a pair of interneurons, the AIYs, which play a role in odor-seeking behavior. In worms that consolidate memory, both sleep and odor conditioning are required to diminish inhibitory synaptic connections between the AWC chemosensory neurons and the AIYs. Thus, we demonstrate in a living organism that sleep is required for events immediately after training that drive memory consolidation and alter synaptic structures.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation among bacterial strains can contribute to heterogeneity in the severity of chronic inflammatory diseases 1,2, but the degree of variation created by de novo mutation during colonization is not well understood. The inflamed skin of people with atopic dermatitis (AD) is frequently colonized with Staphylococcus aureus, an opportunistic pathogen associated with both asymptomatic colonization of nasal passages and invasive disease 3-6. While genetic risk and barrier disruption are critical to AD initiation 7,8, S. aureus colonization is thought to worsen disease severity by promoting skin damage9 1,4,5,10. Here we show, from tracking 23 children treated for AD over 9 months, that S. aureus adapts via de novo mutations during colonization. Patients S. aureus populations are typically dominated by a single lineage, with infrequent invasion by distant lineages. Variants emerge within each lineage with mutation accumulation rates similar to S. aureus in other contexts. Some of these variants replace their ancestors across the body within months, with signatures of adaptive, rather than neutral, forces. Most strikingly, the capsule synthesis gene capD obtained four parallel mutations within one patient and was involved in mutational sweeps in multiple patients. We confirm that selection for capD negativity is common in AD, but not in other contexts, via reanalysis of public S. aureus genomes from 276 people. Our finding of disease-specific selection raises the possibility that adaptation of pathobionts during colonization prolongs the positive feedback cycle of inflammation.",

The model parameters (average firing rate, number of neurons, synaptic connection probability, and postsynaptic duration) are of the order of magnitude of a small mammalian brain, or of human brain areas. Through the use of activity tracking and procedural connectivity (dynamical regeneration of synapses), both computational and memory complexities of this algorithm are proved to be theoretically linear with the number of neurons. These results are experimentally validated by sequential simulations of millions of neurons and billions of synapses running in few minutes using a single thread of an equivalent desktop computer.",

    "abstract": "Centrosomes act as the main microtubule organizing centre (MTOC) in metazoans. Centrosome number is tightly regulated by limiting centriole duplication to a single round per cell cycle. This control is achieved by multiple mechanisms, including the regulation of the protein kinase PLK4, the most upstream facilitator of centriole duplication. Altered centrosome numbers in mouse and human cells cause p53-dependent growth arrest through poorly defined mechanisms. Recent work has shown that the E3 ligase TRIM37 is required for cell cycle arrest in acentrosomal cells. To gain additional insights into this process, we undertook a series of genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens to identify factors important for growth arrest triggered by treatment with centrinone B, a selective PLK4 inhibitor. We found that TRIM37 is a key mediator of growth arrest after partial or full PLK4 inhibition. Interestingly, PLK4 cellular mobility decreased in a dose-dependent manner after centrinone B treatment. In contrast to recent work, we found that growth arrest after PLK4 inhibition correlated better with PLK4 activity than with mitotic length or centrosome number. These data provide insights into the global response to changes in centrosome number and PLK4 activity and extend the role for TRIM37 in regulating the abundance, localization and function of centrosome proteins.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in protein-design methodology have led to a dramatic increase in reliability and scale. With these advances, dozens and even thousands of designed proteins are automatically generated and screened. Nevertheless, the success rate, particularly in design of functional proteins, is low and fundamental goals such as reliable de novo design of efficient enzymes remain beyond reach. Experimental analyses have consistently indicated that a major reason for design failure is inaccuracy and misfolding relative to the design model. To address this challenge, we describe complementary methods to diagnose and ameliorate suboptimal regions in designed proteins: first, we develop a Rosetta atomistic computational mutation scanning approach to detect energetically suboptimal positions in designs (available on a web server https://pSUFER.weizmann.ac.il); second, we demonstrate that AlphaFold2 ab initio structure prediction flags regions that may misfold in designed enzymes and binders; and third, we focus FuncLib design calculations on suboptimal positions in a previously designed low-efficiency enzyme improving its catalytic efficiency by 330 fold. Furthermore, applied to a de novo designed protein that exhibited limited stability, the same approach markedly improved stability and expressibility. Thus, foldability analysis and enhancement may dramatically increase the success rate in design of functional proteins.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is an emerging threat for public health. The success of resistance mutations depends on the trade-off between the benefits and costs they incur. This trade-off is largely unknown and uncharacterized for antifungals. Here, we systematically measure the effect of all amino acid substitutions in the yeast cytosine deaminase Fcy1, the target of the antifungal 5-FC (flucytosine). We identify over 900 missense mutations granting resistance to 5-FC, a large fraction of which appear to act through destabilisation of the protein. The relationship between 5-FC resistance and growth sustained by cytosine deamination is characterized by a sharp trade-off, such that small gains in resistance universally lead to large losses in canonical enzyme function. We show that this steep relationship can be explained by differences in the dose-response functions of 5-FC and cytosine. Finally, we observe the same trade-off shape for the ortholog of FCY1 in Cryptoccocus neoformans, a human pathogen. Our results provide a powerful resource and platform for interpreting drug target variants in fungal pathogens as well as unprecedented insights into resistance-function trade-offs.",

    "abstract": "The ability to retrieve contextual fear memories depends on the coordinated activation of a brain-wide circuitry. Transition from recent to remote memories seems to involve the reorganization of this circuitry, a process called systems consolidation that has been associated with time-dependent fear generalization. However, it is unknown whether emotional memories acquired under different stress levels can undergo different systems consolidation processes. Here, we explored the activation pattern and functional connectivity of key brain regions associated with contextual fear conditioning (CFC) retrieval after recent (2 days) or remote (28 days) memory tests performed in rats submitted to strong (1.0mA footshock) or mild (0.3mA footshock) training. We used brain tissue from Wistar rats from a previous study, where we observed that increasing training intensity promotes fear memory generalization over time, possibly due to an increase in corticosterone (CORT) levels during memory consolidation. Analysis of Fos expression across 8 regions of interest (ROIs) allowed us to identify coactivation between them at both timepoints following memory recall. Our results showed that strong CFC elicits higher Fos activation in the anterior insular and prelimbic cortices during remote retrieval, which was positively correlated with freezing along with the basolateral amygdala. Rats trained either with mild or strong CFC showed broad functional connectivity at the recent timepoint whereas only animals submitted to the strong CFC showed a widespread loss of coactivation during remote retrieval. Post-training plasma CORT levels are positively correlated with FOS expression during recent retrieval in strong CFC, but negatively correlated with FOS expression during remote retrieval in mild CFC. Our findings suggest that increasing training intensity results in differential processes of systems consolidation, possibly associated with increased post-training CORT release, and that strong CFC engages activity from the aIC, BLA and PrL - areas associated with the Salience Network in rats - during remote retrieval.",

    "abstract": "Transient voltage-gated sodium currents are essential for the initiation and conduction of action potentials in neurons and cardiomyocytes. The amplitude and duration of sodium currents are tuned by intracellular fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs/iFGFs) that associate with the cytoplasmic tails of voltage-gated sodium channels (Navs), and genetic ablation of Fhf genes disturbs neurological and cardiac functions. Among reported phenotypes, Fhf2null mice undergo lethal hyperthermia-induced cardiac conduction block attributable to the combined effects of FHF2 deficiency and elevated temperature on the cardiac sodium channel (Nav1.5) inactivation rate. Fhf2null mice also display a lack of heat nociception, while retaining other somatosensory capabilities. Here, we use electrophysiological and computational methods to show that the heat nociception deficit can be explained by the combined effects of elevated temperature and FHF2 deficiency on the fast inactivation gating of Nav1.7 and tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels expressed in dorsal root ganglion C fibers. Hence, neurological and cardiac heat-associated deficits in Fhf2null mice derive from shared impacts of FHF deficiency and temperature towards Nav inactivation gating kinetics in distinct tissues.",

Here we show that in early Drosophila embryos the cytoplasmic concentrations of the key centriole assembly proteins Asl, Plk4, Ana2, Sas-6 and Sas-4 are low, but remain constant throughout the assembly process-- indicating that none of them are limiting for centriole assembly. The cytoplasmic diffusion rate of Ana2/STIL, however, increased significantly towards the end of S-phase as Cdk/Cyclin activity in the embryo increased. A mutant form of Ana2 that cannot be phosphorylated by Cdk/Cyclins did not exhibit the diffusion rate change, and allowed daughter centrioles to grow for an extended period. Thus, the Cdk/Cyclin-dependent phosphorylation of cytoplasmic Ana2 seems to reduce the efficiency of daughter centriole assembly towards the end of S-phase. This helps to ensure that daughter centrioles stop growing at the correct time, and presumably also helps to explain why centrioles cannot duplicate during mitosis when Cdk/Cyclin activity is high.",

    "abstract": "Stress triggers anticipatory physiological responses that promote survival, a phenomenon termed allostasis. However, the chronic activation of energy-dependent allostatic responses results in allostatic load, a dysregulated state that predicts functional decline, accelerates aging, and increases mortality in humans. The energetic cost and cellular basis for the damaging effects of allostatic load have not been defined. Here, by longitudinally profiling three unrelated primary human fibroblast lines across their lifespan, we find that chronic glucocorticoid exposure increases cellular energy expenditure by [~]60%, along with a metabolic shift from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). This state of stress-induced hypermetabolism is linked to mtDNA instability, non-linearly affects age-related cytokines secretion, and accelerates cellular aging based on DNA methylation clocks, telomere shortening rate, and reduced lifespan. Pharmacologically normalizing OxPhos activity while further increasing energy expenditure exacerbates the accelerated aging phenotype, pointing to total energy expenditure as a potential driver of aging dynamics. Together, our findings define bioenergetic and multi-omic recalibrations of stress adaptation, underscoring increased energy expenditure and accelerated cellular aging as interrelated features of cellular allostatic load.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDuring aging, muscle gradually undergoes loss of function including sarcopenia, losing mass, strength, endurance, and oxidative capacity. While mitochondrial aging is associated with decreased mitochondrial capacity, the genes associated with morphological changes in mitochondria during aging still require further elucidation. Furthermore, it is not completely understood how 3D mitochondrial structures are altered during aging in skeletal muscle and cardiac tissues.\n\nMethodsWe measured changes in mitochondrial morphology and mitochondrial complexity during the aging of murine gastrocnemius, soleus, and cardiac tissues using serial block face- scanning electron microscopy and 3D reconstruction. Lipidomic and metabolomic analysis elucidated concomitant changes associated with aging. We also used qPCR, transmission electron microscopy quantification, Seahorse Analyzer, and metabolomics to evaluate changes in mitochondria morphology and function upon loss of the MICOS complex.\n\nResultsWe identified significant changes in 3D mitochondrial size and network configuration in murine gastrocnemius, soleus, and cardiac tissue during aging. These changes were concomitant with loss of mitochondria contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) gene expression during aging. Mitochondrial morphology was similar between aged mice and young mice. We show an age-related loss of the MICOS complex (Chchd3, chchd6, and Mitofilin) while their knockout results in alterations in mitochondrial morphology. Given the critical role of mitochondria in maintaining cellular metabolism, we perform cellular metabolic profiling of young and aged tissues. Metabolomics and lipidomics showed profound alterations, including in membrane integrity, that support our observations of age-related changes in these muscle tissues.\n\nDiscussionIn tandem, our data suggest a relationship between the MICOS complex and aging, which could be linked to disease states with further 3D reconstruction studies. Our study highlights the importance of understanding tissue-dependent 3D mitochondrial phenotypical changes which occur across aging with evolutionary conservation between Drosophila and murine models.\n\nGraphical Abstract",

    "abstract": "While it is now broadly accepted that Homo sapiens originated within Africa, considerable uncertainty surrounds specific models of divergence and migration across the continent. Progress is hampered by a paucity of fossil and genomic data, as well as variability in prior divergence time estimates. Here we use linkage disequilibrium and diversity-based statistics, optimized for rapid, complex demographic inference to discriminate among such models. We infer detailed demographic models for populations across Africa, including representatives from eastern and western groups, as well as 44 newly whole-genome sequenced individuals from the Nama (Khoe-San). Despite the complexity of African population history, contemporary population structure dates back to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. The earliest population divergence among contemporary populations occurs 120-135ka, between the Khoe-San and other groups. Prior to the divergence of contemporary African groups, we infer long-lasting structure between two or more weakly differentiated ancestral Homo populations connected by gene flow over hundreds of thousands of years (i.e. a weakly structured stem). We find that weakly structured stem models provide more likely explanations of polymorphism that had previously been attributed to contributions from archaic hominins in Africa. In contrast to models with archaic introgression, we predict that fossil remains from coexisting ancestral populations should be morphologically similar. Despite genetic similarity between these populations, an inferred 1-4% of genetic differentiation among contemporary human populations can be attributed to genetic drift between stem populations. We show that model misspecification explains variation in previous divergence time estimates and argue that studying a suite of models is key to robust inferences about deep history.",

    "abstract": "When people perform the same task repeatedly, their behavior becomes habitual, or inflexible to changes in the goals or structure of a task. While habits have been hypothesized to be a key aspect of motor skill acquisition, there has been little empirical work investigating the relationship between skills and habits. To better understand this relationship, we examined whether and when peoples behavior would become habitual as they learned a challenging new motor skill. After up to ten days of practice, we altered the structure of the task to assess whether participants would flexibly adjust their behavior or habitually persist in performing the task the way they originally learned. We found that participants behavior became habitual early in practice--after only two days--at which point they were still relatively unskilled. These data demonstrate that motor skills become habitual after relatively little training, but can nevertheless further improve with practice.",

    "abstract": "This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) on 24 hours preserved diluted rooster semen at 4{degrees}C with a low motility percentage during 2 hours at room temperature incubation. Ten indigenous same-aged roosters were used in this study, adapted by Dorso-abdominal massage for semen collection for one month before starting main work. Semen was collected weekly twice by the Dorso-abdominal massage technique, collected semen transferred to the laboratory in less than 10 minutes, and took a previous qualifying examination. Qualify semen from each rooster polled together and diluted by the Lake extender and preserved for 24 hours at 4{degrees}C in the refrigerator. Different ACh concentrations (10mM-100mM) were added to Low motile semen and stored for 24 h at 4{degrees}C, and the quality parameters such as motility, viability, acrosome, and plasma membrane integrity were measured evaluated. Adding ACh in 10mM for the low motile semen significantly increased semen motility from 50% to 78.5% (P<0.05) at time zero, but other ACh concentrations did not have any significant differences compared to control. During two hours incubation of recovered semen at room temperature, 10mM ACh prevented declining semen motility compared to control and other ACh concentrations significantly (P<0.05), which motility in 10mM ACh concentration 59%. In contrast, control, 1mM ACh, and 100M ACh group was 2.5%, 4%, and 1%, respectively. Semen viability after two hours of recovery at room temperature significantly 3.5% was less than the control group (P<0.05), but acrosome and plasma membrane integrity has not had any differences between all experimental groups (P>0.05). We can conclude that 10mM ACh can recover semen motility and not have toxicity and side effects on semen quality.",

    "abstract": "Collective cell migration is essential for embryonic development, tissue regeneration and repair, and has been implicated in pathological conditions such as cancer metastasis. It is, in part, directed by external cues that promote front-to-rear polarity in individual cells. However, our understanding of the pathways that underpin the directional movement of cells in response to external cues remains incomplete. To examine this issue we made use of neural crest cells (NC), which migrate as a collective during development to generate vital structures including bones and cartilage. Using a candidate approach, we found an essential role for Ran-binding protein 1 (RanBP1), a key effector of the nucleocytoplasmic transport pathway, in enabling directed migration of these cells. Our results indicate that RanBP1 is required for establishing front-to-rear polarity, so that NCs are able to chemotax. Moreover, our work suggests that RanBP1 function in chemotaxis involves the polarity kinase LKB1/PAR4. We envisage that regulated nuclear export of LKB1 through Ran/RanBP1 is a key regulatory step required for establishing front-to-rear polarity and thus chemotaxis, during NC collective migration.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria contain an independent genome, called mtDNA, which contains essential metabolic genes. Although mtDNA mutations occur at high frequency, they are inherited infrequently, indicating that germline mechanisms limit their accumulation. To determine how germline mtDNA is regulated, we examined the control of mtDNA quantity and quality in C. elegans primordial germ cells (PGCs). We show that PGCs generate a bottleneck in mtDNA number by segregating mitochondria into lobe-like protrusions that are cannibalized by adjacent cells, reducing mtDNA content two-fold. As PGCs exit quiescence and divide, mtDNAs replicate to maintain a set point of [~]200 mtDNAs per germline stem cell. Whereas PGC lobe cannibalism eliminates mtDNAs stochastically, we show that the kinase PINK1, operating independently of Parkin and autophagy, preferentially reduces the fraction of mutant mtDNAs. Thus, PGCs employ parallel mechanisms to control both the quantity and quality of the founding population of germline mtDNAs.",

    "abstract": "Cell types are the fundamental building blocks of metazoan biodiversity and offer a powerful perspective for inferring evolutionary phenomena. With the development of single-cell transcriptomic techniques, new definitions of cell types are emerging. This allows a conceptual reassessment of traditional definitions of novel cell types and their evolution. Research in echinoderms, particularly sea star and sea urchin embryos have contributed significantly to understanding the evolution of novel cell types, in particular the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) and pigment cells that are found in sea urchin but not sea star embryos. This paper outlines the development of a gene expression atlas for the bat star, Patiria miniata, using single nuclear RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of embryonic stages. The atlas revealed 22 cell clusters covering all expected cell types from the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm germ layers. In particular, four distinct neural clusters, an immune cluster, and distinct right and left coelom clusters were revealed as distinct cell states. A comparison with Strongylocentrotus purpuratus embryo single cell transcriptomes was performed using 1:1 orthologs to anchor and then compare gene expression patterns. S. purpuratus primordial germ cell equivalents were not detected in P. minata, while the left coelom of P. miniata has no equivalent cell cluster in S. purpuratus. Pigment cells of S. purpuratus map to clusters containing immune mesenchyme and neural cells of P. miniata, while the PMCs of S. purpuratus are revealed as orthologous to the right coelom cluster of P. miniata. These results suggest a new interpretation of the evolution of these well-studied cell types and a reflection on the definition of novel cell types.",

    "abstract": "Certain species within the genus Pseudo-nitzschia are able to produce the neurotoxin domoic acid (DA), which can cause illness in humans, mass-mortality of marine animals, and closure of commercial and recreational shellfisheries during toxic events. Understanding and forecasting blooms of these harmful species is a primary management goal. However, accurately predicting the onset and severity of bloom events remains difficult, in part because the underlying drivers of bloom formation have not been fully resolved. Furthermore, Pseudo-nitzschia species often co-occur, and recent work suggests that the genetic composition of a Pseudo-nitzschia bloom may be a better predictor of toxicity than prevailing environmental conditions. We developed a novel next-generation sequencing assay using restriction site-associated DNA (2b-RAD) genotyping and applied it to mock Pseudo-nitzschia communities generated by mixing cultures of different species in known abundances. On average, 94% of the variance in observed species abundance was explained by the expected abundance. In addition, the false positive rate was low (0.45% on average) and unrelated to read depth, and false negatives were never observed. Application of this method to environmental DNA samples collected during natural Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom events in Southern California revealed that increases in DA were associated with increases in the relative abundance of P. australis. Although the absolute correlation across time-points was weak, an independent species fingerprinting assay (Automated Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer Analysis) supported this and identified other potentially toxic species. Finally, we assessed population-level genomic variation by mining SNPs from the environmental 2bRAD dataset. Consistent shifts in allele frequencies in P. pungens and P. subpacifica were detected between high and low DA years, suggesting that different intraspecific variants may be associated with prevailing environmental conditions or the presence of DA. Taken together, this method presents a potentially cost-effective and high-throughput approach for studies aiming to evaluate both population and species dynamics in mixed samples.\n\nHighlightsO_LI2bRAD method facilitates species- and population-level analysis of the same sample\nC_LIO_LIMethod accurately quantifies species relative abundance with low false positives\nC_LIO_LIConsistent shifts in allele frequencies were detected between high and low DA years\nC_LIO_LICertain Pseudo-nitzschia spp. populations may be more associated with DA presence\nC_LI",

Sequential pulse-chase experiments showed that the progressive transition of Msx1+ naive progenitors into proximal and autopodial progenitors coincides with their differentiation to Sox9+ chondroprogenitors, which occurs along all the forming skeletal segments.\n\nIndeed, tracking the spatiotemporal sequence of differentiation showed that the skeleton forms progressively in a complex pattern.

Intriguingly, the restorative effects of lacripep occur despite extensive immune cell infiltration, suggesting tissue reinnervation and regeneration can be achieved under chronic inflammatory conditions.

    "abstract": "The aging process is manifested by a multitude of interlinked biological processes. These processes contribute to genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient-sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. Together these are recognized as of the main risk factors of the worlds most prevalent diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancer, cardiovascular disease, and metabolic disease.\n\nThe mammalian ortholog of the yeast silent information regulator (Sir2) SIRT1 is a NAD+-dependent class III histone deacetylase and has been recognized to be involved in many of the forementioned processes. Therefore, its activity is connected to aging via the regulation of apoptosis, cell differentiation, development, stress response, metabolism, and tumorigenesis. Furthermore, the physiological activity of several sirtuin family members has been connected to the regulation of life span of lower organisms (Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster) as well as mammals. Aging in somatic cells of mammals is accompanied by mutations and other forms of DNA damage. These might manifest in transient cell cycle arrest associated with DNA repair, apoptosis, senescence, or cell differentiation. The activity of SIRT1 has previously been reported to be regulated by the DNA damage response pathway. On the one hand, SIRT1 is recruited from ATM to DBS and is required for DNA damage repair, but on the other hand, SIRT1 activity was also found to be negatively regulated by genotoxic stress via the interaction of ATM with Deleted in Breast Cancer 1 (DBC1). Increased levels of DBS are associated with downregulation of ATM and lower phosphorylation levels of AKT and GSK3{beta}, with significant implications for mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) maintenance and differentiation. In this proposed \"stem cell checkpoint,\" the ATM signalling pathway initiated by DBS maintains MSCs and blocks their differentiation. Based on this, it has already been established that in senescent mesenchymal stem cells, SIRT1 expression is decreased, while its overexpression delays the onset of senescence and loss of differentiation capacity/ability.\n\nIn the present study, we provide evidence that SIX2-positive urine derived renal progenitor cells-UdRPCs isolated directly from human urine show typical hallmarks of aging when obtained from elderly donors. This includes the transcriptional downregulation of SIRT1 and its downstream targets AKT and GSK3{beta}. This transcriptional downregulation is accompanied by an increase in DNA damage and transcriptional levels several cell cycle inhibitors such as P16, reflecting possibly the ATM induced \"stemness checkpoint\" to maintain UdRPC stemness and differentiation capacity. We provide evidence that the renal progenitor transcription factor SIX2 binds to the coding sequence of SIRT1 and both factors mutually influence the transcription of each other. Furthermore, we show that the SIRT1 promoter region is methylation sensitive and becomes subsequently methylated in UdRPCs derived from aged donors, dividing them into SIRT1 high and low expressing UdRPCs. This downregulation might render the cells more vulnerable to endogenous noxae accelerating the accumulation of DNA damage and ultimately the accumulation of aging associated hallmarks.",

    "abstract": "Actin-based protrusions are found on the surface of all eukaryotic cells, where they support diverse biological activities essential for life. Models of protrusion growth hypothesize that actin filament assembly provides the mechanical force for bending the plasma membrane outward. However, membrane-associated myosin motors are also abundant in protrusions, though their potential for contributing growth-promoting force remains unexplored. Using a novel inducible system that docks myosin motor domains to membrane binding modules with temporal control, we found that the application of myosin-generated force to the plasma membrane is sufficient for driving robust elongation of protrusions. Protrusion growth scaled with motor accumulation, required active, barbed end-directed force, and was independent of cargo delivery or the recruitment of canonical barbed end elongation factors. Application of growth-promoting force was also supported by structurally distinct myosin motor domains and membrane binding modules. We conclude that myosin-generated force can drive protrusion growth and this mechanism is likely active in diverse biological contexts.",

While the acquisition and (semi-)automatic segmentation of multicellular EM volumes is now becoming routine, large-scale analysis remains severely limited by the lack of generally applicable pipelines for automatic extraction of comprehensive morphological descriptors. Here, we present a novel unsupervised method for learning cellular morphology features directly from 3D EM data: a convolutional neural network delivers a representation of cells by shape and ultrastructure. Applied to the full volume of an entire three-segmented worm of the annelid Platynereis dumerilii, it yields a visually consistent grouping of cells supported by specific gene expression profiles. Integration of features across spatial neighbours can retrieve tissues and organs, revealing, for example, a detailed organization of the animal foregut. We envision that the unbiased nature of the proposed morphological descriptors will enable rapid exploration of very different biological questions in large EM volumes, greatly increasing the impact of these invaluable, but costly resources.",

We found that there exit short c-terminal MSI1 variants (MSI1-C, hMSI1272-362 or mMSI1138-362) in naive but not primed ESCs. When overexpressed, MSI1 and MSI1-C variants facilitate primed-to-naive pluripotency transition by elevating the pluripotency of primed hESCs toward a formative-like state, enable better survival of hESCs in human-mouse interspecies cell completion, and enhance the ability of blastoid formation of hESCs after naive induction. Mechanistically, we show that the MSI1-C variants, though lacking RNA recognition motifs, bind to RNAs, enhance stress resistance and upregulate DNA damage repair genes.

    "abstract": "BackgroundChitin is a common component in the natural diet of many fish, and a range of chitinases with the potential to down chitin have been identified. Yet whether chitin is metabolized in fish is still unclear. Here we used a combination of chitinase activity assay, transcriptomics, and 16S rRNA bacterial analysis to assess the effect of chitin supplementation on Atlantic salmon gene expression and microbial community.\n\nResultsAtlantic salmon express multiple genes associated with chitin metabolism, and we show that the expression and activity of Atlantic salmon chitinases are not affected by the addition of dietary chitin. We do, however, demonstrate an association between gut microbial composition, chitinase activity in the gut, and host chitinase expression.\n\nConclusionThe findings presented here support the idea that chitin metabolism genes are linked to the maintenance of a chitin-based barrier in the teleost gut. These results contribute to a greater understanding of chitin metabolism in fish.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChronic wounds are usually challenging to treat due to underlying medical conditions of the individual and as they readily become infected by microorganisms due to the failure of mechanical and physiological first line innate immune responses. We report here the characterization of host adaptation of five E. coli genomes including three E. coli ST131 genomes that occurred concomitantly with Enterococcus faecalis from a 10-year chronic wound infection after a foot fracture during the 2004 tsunami.\n\nMethodsThe five E. coli strains were characterized by various microbiological and genomic approaches. Microbiological methods were antimicrobial resistance, growth in different media and biofilm formation. Genomic methods were determination of the genome sequence by PacBio RSII and Illumina sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses and genome alterations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, deletion and rearrangements that led to pseudogenes and chromosomal inversions were documented. Relevant selected metabolic and physiological pathways were analyzed for integrity.\n\nFindingStrains of two initially present sequence types, including the highly antimicrobial resistant ST405 clone, were subsequently replaced by isolates of the ubiquitous ST131 clone. The three E. coli ST131 strains showed a heavily host-adapted genome with a high number of pseudogenes and a large chromosomal inversion compared to ST131 reference strains. Furthermore, two of three E. coli ST131 isolates were small colony variants with its genetic basis in multiple genome alterations including pseudogenes and deletions in the pathway for heme biosynthesis. Pseudogene analysis indicated also the three ST131 strains to be mutator strains. Although enhanced capability of biofilm formation of the ST131 isolates was indicated by the agar plate assay, the a liquid culture biofilm assay did not display pronounced biofilm formation suggesting unconventional modes of biofilm formation.\n\nInterpretationST131 clone members, which originally appeared as commensal strains can cause urinary tract and blood stream infections and are ubiquitously found in the environment including waste water and in animals. ST131 strains have presumably been already acquired from the environment on occurrence of the initial foot fracture and can persist in wounds showing an outmost genome plasticity and adaptability which might causing the chronic infection. Although co-infection with E. faecalis might have supported chronicity, these findings indicate that in individuals with underlying metabolic diseases wound infection by ST131 E. coli isolates can be a health risk.\n\nFundingThis work was partially funded by ALF.",

    "abstract": "Classical cadherins are transmembrane proteins whose extracellular domains link neighboring cells, and whose intracellular domains connect to the actin cytoskeleton via {beta}-catenin, - catenin. The cadherin-catenin complex transmits forces that drive tissue morphogenesis and wound healing. In addition, tension-dependent changes in E-catenin conformation enables it to recruit the actin-binding protein vinculin to cell-cell junctions, where it contributes to junctional strengthening. How and whether multiple cadherin-complexes cooperate to reinforce cell-cell junctions in response to load remains poorly understood. Here, we used single-molecule optical trap measurements to examine how multiple cadherin-catenin complexes interact with F-actin under load, and how this interaction is influenced by the presence of vinculin. We show that force oriented toward the (-) end of the actin filament results in mean lifetimes 3-fold longer than when force was applied towards the barbed (+) end. Further, load is distributed asymmetrically among complexes, such that only one bears the majority of applied load. We also measured force-dependent actin binding by a quaternary complex comprising the cadherin-catenin complex and the vinculin head region, which cannot itself bind actin. Binding lifetimes of this quaternary complex increased as additional complexes bound F-actin, but only when load was oriented toward the (-) end. In contrast, the cadherin-catenin complex alone did not show this form of cooperativity. These findings reveal multi-level, force-dependent regulation that enhances the strength of the association of multiple cadherin/catenin complexes with F-actin, conferring positive feedback that may strengthen the junction and polarize F-actin to facilitate the emergence of higher-order cytoskeletal organization.",

    "abstract": "Few models exist that allow for rapid and effective screening of anti-metastasis drugs. Here, we present a phenotype-based chemical screen utilizing gastrulation of zebrafish embryos for identification of anti-metastasis drugs. Based on the evidence that metastasis proceeds through utilizing the molecular mechanisms of gastrulation, we hypothesize that chemicals which interrupt zebrafish gastrulation might suppress metastasis of cancer cells. Thus, we developed a drug screening protocol which uses epiboly, the first morphogenetic movement in gastrulation, as a marker. The screen only needs zebrafish embryos and enables hundreds of chemicals to be tested in five hours through observing epiboly progression of a test chemical-treated embryos. In the screen, embryos at the two-cell stage are firstly corrected and then developed to the sphere stage. The embryos are treated with a test chemical and incubated in the presence of the chemical until vehicle-treated embryos develop to 90% epiboly stage. Finally, positive  hit chemicals that interrupt epiboly progression are selected through comparing epiboly progression of the chemical-treated embryos with that of vehicle-treated embryos under a stereoscopic microscope. Previous study subjected 1,280 FDA-approved drugs to the screen and identified Adrenosterone and Pizotifen as epiboly-interrupting drugs. These drugs were validated to suppress metastasis of breast cancer cells in mice models of metastasis. Furthermore, 11{beta}-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase 1 (HSD11{beta}1) and serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C), which are primary target of Adrenosterone and Pizotifen respectively, promotes metastasis through induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). That indicates the screen could be diverted to a chemical genetic screening platform for identification of metastasis-promoting genes.",

    "abstract": "Herpesviruses - ubiquitous pathogens that cause persistent infections - have some of the most complex cell entry mechanisms. Entry of the prototypical herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) requires coordinated efforts of 4 glycoproteins, gB, gD, gH, and gL. The current model posits that the glycoproteins do not interact prior to receptor engagement and that binding of gD to its receptor causes a \"cascade\" of sequential pairwise interactions, first activating the gH/gL complex and subsequently activating gB, the viral fusogen. But how these glycoproteins interact remains unresolved. Here, using a quantitative split-luciferase approach, we show that pairwise HSV-1 glycoprotein complexes form prior to fusion, remain stable throughout fusion, and do not depend on the presence of the cellular receptor. Based on our findings, we propose a revised \"conformational cascade\" model of HSV-1 entry. We hypothesize that all 4 glycoproteins assemble into a complex prior to fusion, with gH/gL positioned between gD and gB. Once gD binds to a cognate receptor, the proximity of the glycoproteins within this complex allows for efficient transmission of the activating signal from the receptor-activated gD to gH/gL to gB through sequential conformational changes, ultimately triggering the fusogenic refolding of gB. Our results also highlight previously unappreciated contributions of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains to glycoprotein interactions and fusion. Similar principles could be at play in other multicomponent viral entry systems, and the split luciferase approach used here is a powerful tool for investigating protein-protein interactions in these and a variety of other systems.\n\nIMPORTANCEHerpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infects the majority of humans for life and can cause diseases ranging from painful sores to deadly brain inflammation. No vaccines or curative treatments currently exist. HSV-1 infection of target cells requires coordinated efforts of four viral glycoproteins. But how these glycoproteins interact remains unclear. Using a quantitative protein interaction assay, we found that HSV-1 glycoproteins form stable, receptor-independent complexes. We propose that the 4 proteins form a complex, which could facilitate transmission of the entry-triggering signal from the receptor-binding component to the membrane fusogen component through sequential conformational changes. Similar principles could be applicable across other multicomponent protein systems. A revised model of HSV-1 entry could facilitate the development of therapeutics targeting this process.",

    "abstract": "Electromicrobiology can be used to understand extracellular electron uptake in previously undescribed chemolithotrophs. Enrichment and characterization of the uncultivated electroautotroph \"Candidatus Tenderia electrophaga\" using electromicrobiology led to the designation of the order Tenderiales. Representative Tenderiales metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) have been identified in a number of environmental surveys, yet a comprehensive characterization of conserved genes for extracellular electron uptake has thus far not been conducted. Using comparative genomics we identified conserved orthologous genes within the Tenderiales and nearest neighbor orders important for extracellular electron uptake based on a previously proposed pathway from \"Ca. Tenderia electrophaga\". The Tenderiales contained a conserved cluster we designated uetABCDEFGHIJ, which encodes proteins containing features that would enable transport of extracellular electrons to cytoplasmic membrane bound energy transducing complexes such as two conserved cytochrome cbb3 oxidases. For example, UetJ is predicted to be an extracellular undecaheme c-type cytochrome that forms a heme wire. We also identified clusters of genes predicted to facilitate assembly and maturation of electron transport proteins, as well as cellular attachment to surfaces. Autotrophy among the Tenderiales is supported by the presence of carbon fixation and stress response pathways that could allow cellular growth by extracellular electron uptake. Key differences between the Tenderiales and other known neutrophilic iron oxidizers were revealed, including very few Cyc2 genes in the Tenderiales. Our results reveal a possible conserved pathway for extracellular electron uptake and suggests the Tenderiales have an distribution unlimited ecological role coupling metal or mineral redox chemistry and the carbon cycle in marine and brackish sediments.\n\nImportanceElectromicrobiology enables enrichment and identification of chemolithotrophic bacteria capable of extracellular electron uptake to drive energy metabolism and CO2 fixation. The recently described order Tenderiales contains the uncultivated electroautotroph \"Candidatus Tenderia electrophaga\". The \"Ca. Tenderia electrophaga\" genome contains genes proposed to make up a previously undescribed extracellular electron uptake pathway. Here we use comparative genomics to show that this pathway is well conserved among Tenderiales spp. recovered by metagenome assembled genomes. This conservation extends to near neighbors of the Tenderiales, but not to other well-studied chemolithotrophs including iron and sulfur oxidizers. Our findings suggest that extracellular electron uptake may be pervasive among the Tenderiales and the geographic location from which metagenome assembled genomes were recovered offers clues to their natural ecological niche.",

    "abstract": "To understand the process by which new protein functions emerge, we examined how the yeast heterochromatin protein Sir3 arose through gene duplication from the conserved DNA replication protein Orc1. Orc1 is a subunit of the origin recognition complex (ORC), which marks origins of DNA replication. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Orc1 also promotes heterochromatin assembly by recruiting the structural proteins Sir1-4 to silencer DNA. In contrast, the paralog of Orc1, Sir3, is a nucleosome-binding protein that spreads across heterochromatic loci in conjunction with other Sir proteins. We previously found that a non-duplicated Orc1 from the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis behaved like ScSir3 but did not have a silencer-binding function like ScOrc1. Moreover, K. lactis lacks Sir1, the protein that interacts directly with ScOrc1. Here, we searched for the presumed intermediate state in which non-duplicated Orc1 possesses both the silencer-binding and spreading functions. In the non-duplicated species Torulaspora delbrueckii, which has an ortholog of Sir1 (TdKos3), we found that TdOrc1 spreads across heterochromatic loci independently of ORC, as ScSir3 and KlOrc1 do. This spreading is dependent on the nucleosome binding BAH domain of Orc1 and on Sir2 and Kos3. However, TdOrc1 does not have a silencer-binding function: T. delbrueckii silencers do not require ORC binding sites to function, and Orc1 and Kos3 do not appear to interact. Instead, Orc1 and Kos3 both spread across heterochromatic loci with other Sir proteins. Thus, Orc1 and Sir1/Kos3 originally had different roles in heterochromatin formation than they do now in S. cerevisiae.",

Mixed-model analysis of variance and factorial analysis of covariance, using body size as a covariate, followed by post-hoc analysis was performed to identify significant strain differences.\n\nResultsStrain specific changes in axial and retinal biometry along with significant effects of age, sex and body size on AL were noted.

While a comparable decrease in PL was observed in Mfrprd6, Prss56glcr4, and Adipor1tm1Dgen homozygotes, the decrease was attributed to changes in different posterior components from each mutant. Mfrprd6 and Adipor1tm1Dgen homozygotes developed regularly sized fundus spots across the ocular globe, which differed from the large bright spots seen in aged Prss56glcr4 and Prss56em2(IMPC)J homozygotes.

    "abstract": "Apoptosis is a programmed form of cell death important for the development and maintenance of tissue homeostasis. The BCL-2 protein family controls key steps in apoptosis, dysregulation of which can lead to a wide range of human diseases. BCL-2 proteins comprise three groups: anti-apoptotic proteins, pro-apoptotic proteins, and BH3-only proteins. BAK is one of two pro-apoptotic proteins, and previous work has shown that binding of certain BH3-only proteins such as truncated BID (tBID), BIM, or PUMA to BAK leads to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, the release of cytochrome c, and ultimately cell death. This process, referred to as activation, involves the BH3-stimulated conversion of BAK from monomer to dimer and then to oligomers that promote membrane disruption. Crystal structures of putative intermediates in this pathway, crosslinking data, and in vitro functional tests have provided insights into the activation event, yet the sequence-function relationships that make some but not all BH3-only proteins function as activators remain largely unexamined. In this work, we used computational protein design, yeast surface-display screening of candidate BH3-like peptides, and structure-based energy scoring to identify ten new binders of BAK that span a large sequence space. Among the new binders are two peptides from human proteins BNIP5 and PXT1 that promote BAK activation in liposome assays and induce cytochrome-c release from mitochondria, expanding current views of how BAK-mediated cell death may be triggered in cells. High-resolution crystal structures and binding experiments revealed a high degree of similarity in binding geometry, affinity, and association kinetics between peptide activators and inhibitors, including peptides described previously and those identified in this work. We propose a model for BAK activation that is based on differential engagement of BAK monomers vs. the BAK activation transition state that integrates our observations with previous reports of BAK binders, activators, and inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Humans and Acanthamoeba Polyphaga Mimivirus share numerous homologous genes, including collagens and collagen-modifying enzymes. To explore the homology, we performed a genome-wide comparison between human and mimivirus using DELTA-BLAST (Domain Enhanced Lookup Time Accelerated BLAST) and identified 52 new mimiviral proteins that are homologous with human proteins. To gain functional insights into mimiviral proteins, their human protein homologs were organized into Gene Ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathways to build a functional network. Collagen and collagen-modifying enzymes form the largest subnetwork with most nodes. Further analysis of this subnetwork identified a putative collagen glycosyltransferase R699. Protein expression test suggested that R699 is highly expressed in E coli, unlike the human collagen-modifying enzymes. Enzymatic activity assays showed that R699 catalyzes the conversion of unique galactosylhydroxylysine within the GXXXUG motif (U=galactosylhydroxylysine) to glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine on collagen using uridine diphosphate glucose (UDP-Glc) as a sugar donor, suggesting R699 is a mimiviral collagen galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase (GGT) with defined substrate specificity. Structural study of R699 produced the first crystal structure of a collagen GGT with a visible UDP-Glc. Sugar moiety of the UDP-Glc resides in a previously unrecognized pocket. Mn2+ coordination and nucleoside-diphosphate binding site are conserved among GGT family members and critical for R699s collagen GGT activity.

    "abstract": "BackgroundReductionist two-dimensional (2D) in vitro assays have long been the standard for studying the metastatic abilities of cancer cells. However, tri-dimensional (3D) organotypic models provide a more complex environment, closer to that seen in patients, and thereby provide a more accurate representation of their true capabilities. Our laboratory has previously shown that the antiprogestin and antiglucocorticoid mifepristone can reduce the growth, adhesion, migration, and invasion of various aggressive cancer cells assessed using 2D assays. In this study, we characterize the metastatic capabilities of high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells generated along disease progression, in both 2D and 3D assays, and the ability of cytostatic doses of mifepristone to inhibit them.\n\nMethodsHigh-grade serous ovarian cancer cells collected from two separate patients at different stages of their disease were used throughout the study. The 2D wound healing and Boyden chamber assays were used to study migration, while a layer of extracellular matrix was added to the Boyden chamber to study invasion. A 3D organotypic model, composed of fibroblasts embedded in collagen I and topped with a monolayer of mesothelial cells was used to further study cancer cell adhesion and mesothelial displacement. All assays were studied in cells representing different stages of disease progression in the absence or presence of cytostatic doses of mifepristone.\n\nResults2D in vitro assays demonstrated that the migration and invasive rates of the cells isolated from both patients decreased along disease progression. Conversely, in both patients, cells representing late-stage disease demonstrated a higher adhesion capacity to the 3D organotypic model than those representing an early-stage disease. This adhesive behavior is associated with the in vivo tumor capacity of the cells. Regardless of these differences in adhesive, migratory, and invasive behavior among the experimental protocols used, cytostatic doses of mifepristone were able to inhibit the adhesion, migration, and invasion rates of all cells studied, regardless of their basal capabilities over reductionist or organotypic metastatic in vitro model systems. Finally, we demonstrate that when cells acquire the capacity to grow spontaneously as spheroids, they do attach to a 3D organotypic model system when pre-incubated with conditioned media. Of relevance, mifepristone was able to cause dissociation or \"cleavage\" of these multicellular structures.\n\nConclusionDifferences in cellular behaviours were observed between reductionist 2D and 3D assays when studying the metastatic capabilities of high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells representing disease progression. Mifepristone inhibited these metastatic capabilities in all assays studied.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes, otherwise known as Group A Streptococcus (GAS), is an important and highly adaptable human pathogen with the ability to cause both superficial and severe diseases. Understanding how S. pyogenes senses and responds to its environment will likely aid in determining how it causes a breadth of diseases. One regulatory network involved in GASs ability to sense and respond to the changing environment is the Rgg2/3 quorum sensing (QS) system, which responds to metal and carbohydrate availability and regulates changes to the bacterial surface. To better understand the impact of Rgg2/3 QS on S. pyogenes physiology, we performed RNA-seq and TMT-LC-MS/MS analysis on cells in which this system was induced or disrupted. Primary findings confirmed that pheromone stimulation in wildtype cultures is limited to the induction of operons whose promoters contain previously determined Rgg2/3 binding sequences. However, supplementing exogenous pheromone to a deletion mutant of rgg3, a strain that endogenously produces elevated amounts of pheromone, led to extended alterations of the transcriptome and proteome, ostensibly by stress-induced pathways. Under such exaggerated pheromone conditions ({Delta}rgg3+SHP), a connection was identified between Rgg2/3 and the stringent response. Mutation of relA, the bifunctional guanosine tetra- and penta-phosphate nucleoside synthetase/hydrolase, and alarmone synthase genes sasA and sasB, impacted culture doubling times and disabled induction of Rgg2/3 in response to mannose, while manipulation of Rgg2/3 signaling modestly altered nucleotide levels. Our findings indicate that excessive pheromone production or exposure places stress on GAS resulting in an indirect altered proteome and transcriptome beyond primary pheromone signaling.\n\nIMPORTANCEStreptococcus pyogenes causes several important human diseases. This study evaluates how the induction or disruption of a cell-cell communication system alters S. pyogeness gene expression and, in extreme conditions, its physiology. Using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches, the results define the pheromone-dependent regulon of the Rgg2/3 quorum sensing system. In addition, we find that excessive pheromone stimulation, generated by genetic disruption of the system, leads to stress responses that are associated with the stringent response. Disruption of this stress response affects the ability of the cell-cell communication system to respond under certain conditions. These findings assist in the determination of how S. pyogenes is impacted by and responds to non-traditional sources of stress.",

    "abstract": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) causes a lethal swine hemorrhagic disease and is currently responsible for widespread damage to the pig industry. The molecular mechanisms of ASFV pathogenicity and its interaction with host responses remain poorly understood. In this study, we profiled the temporal viral and host transcriptomes in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) infected at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours with highly virulent (SY18) and low virulent (HuB20) ASFV strains. We first identified profound differences in the virus expression programs between SY18 and HuB20, while the transcriptome dynamics in host cells were dominated by infection time. Through integrated computational analysis and experimental validation, we identified differentially expressed genes and related biological processes, and elaborated differential usage of the NF-kappaB related pathways by the two virus strains. In addition, we observed that compared to the highly virulent SY18 strain, HuB20 infection quickly activates expression of receptors, sensors, regulators, as well as downstream effectors, including cGAS, STAT1/2, IRF9, MX1/2, suggesting rapid induction of a strong immune response. Lastly, we constructed a host-virus coexpression network, which shed light on pathogenic functions of several ASFV genes. Taken together, these results will provide a basis for further mechanistic studies on the functions of both viral and cellular genes that are involved in different responses.\n\nAuthor SummarySince it was first described in Kenya in 1921, ASF has spread across sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean, the Western Europe, the Trans-Caucasus region, and the Russian Federation. Recent outbreaks have also been reported in Asia, which has devastated the pig industry, resulting in an approximately 40% reduction in pork worldwide. In the absence of effective vaccine or treatment, the mortality for infections with highly virulent strains approaches 100%, while low virulent strains causing less mortality spreads fast recently. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of ASFV pathogenicity, especially the differences between highly and low virulent strains remain poorly understood. Here, we used RNA-seq to analyze the viral and host transcriptome changes in PAMs infected with a virulent strain (SY18) or an attenuated strain (HuB20) at different stages. We found that the presence of ASFV significantly affected the cellular transcriptome profile. In addition, we did temporal and described the dynamic expression programs induced in the host cells by ASFV infection of different virulence strains. In particular, we identified differential gene expression patterns in host innate immune responses and expressed cytokines and chemokines between ASFV strains of different virulence. Our study provides new insights into ASFV pathogenicity research and novel drug or vaccine targets.",

    "abstract": "\"Leaky gut\", or high intestinal barrier permeability, is common in preterm newborns. The role of microbiota in this process remains largely uncharacterized. We employed both short- and long-read sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and metagenomes to characterize the intestinal microbiome of a longitudinal cohort of 113 preterm infants born between 240/7-326/7 weeks of gestation. Enabled by enhanced taxonomic resolution, we found significantly increased abundance of Bifidobacterium breve and a diet rich in mothers breastmilk to be associated with intestinal barrier maturation during the first week of life. We combined these factors using genome- resolved metagenomics and identified a highly specialized genetic capability of the Bifidobacterium strains to assimilate human milk oligosaccharides and host-derived glycoproteins. Our study proposed mechanistic roles of breastmilk feeding and intestinal microbial colonization in postnatal intestinal barrier maturation; these observations are critical towards advancing therapeutics to prevent and treat hyperpermeable gut- associated conditions, including necrotizing enterocolitis.\n\nIMPORTANCEDespite improvements in neonatal intensive care, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. \"Leaky gut\", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability, is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC. Early detection and intervention to prevent leaky gut in \"at-risk\" preterm neonates is critical to lower the risk for potentially life-threatening complications like NEC. However, the complex interactions between the developing gut microbial community, nutrition, and intestinal barrier function, remain largely uncharacterized. In this study, we revealed the critical role of sufficient breastmilk feeding volume and specialized carbohydrate metabolism capability of Bifidobacterium in coordinated postnatal improvement of intestinal barrier. Determining the clinical and microbial biomarkers that drive the intestinal developmental disparity will inform early detection and novel therapeutic strategies to promote appropriate intestinal barrier maturation, prevent NEC and other adverse health conditions in preterm infants.",

    "abstract": "Bunyaviruses belong to the order Bunyavirales, the largest group of RNA viruses. They infect a wide variety of host species around the world, including plants, animals and humans, and pose a major threat to public health. Major families in the order Bunyavirales have tri-segmented negative-sense RNA genomes, the 5 and 3 ends of which form complementary strands that serve as a replication promoter. Elucidation of the mechanisms by which viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase recognizes the promoter to initiates RNA synthesis is important for understanding viral replication and pathogenesis, and for developing antivirals. A list of replication promoter configuration patterns may provide details on the differences in the replication mechanisms among bunyaviruses. Here, by using public sequence data of all known bunyavirus species, we constructed a comprehensive list of the replication promoters comprising 40 nucleotides in both the 5 and 3 ends of the genome that form a specific complementary strand. We showed that among tri-segmented bunyaviruses, viruses belonging to the family Nairoviridae, including the highly pathogenic Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, have evolved a GC-rich promoter structure that differs from that of other bunyaviruses. The unique promoter structure might be related to the large genome size of the family Nairoviridae among bunyaviruses. It is possible that the large genome architecture confers a pathogenic advantage. The promoter list provided in this report is expected to be useful for predicting virus family-specific replication mechanisms of segmented negative-sense RNA viruses.",

    "abstract": "Cell-cell signaling mediated by Rgg-family transcription factors and their cognate pheromones is conserved in Firmicutes, including all streptococci. In Streptococcus pyogenes, or Group A strep, one of these systems, the Rgg2/3 quorum sensing (QS) system, has been shown to regulate phenotypes including cellular aggregation and biofilm formation, lysozyme resistance, and macrophage immunosuppression. Here, we show that the abundance of several secreted virulence factors (streptolysin O, SpyCEP, and M protein) decreases upon induction of QS. The main mechanism underlying the changes in protein levels appears to be transcriptional, occurs downstream of the QS circuit and is dysregulated by the deletion of an Rgg2/3 QS-regulated major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter. Additionally, we identify this MFS transporter as the factor responsible for a previously observed increase in aminoglycoside sensitivity in QS-induced cells.\n\nImportanceThe production of virulence factors is a tightly regulated process in bacterial pathogens. Efforts to elucidate the mechanisms by which genes are regulated may advance the understanding of factors influencing pathogen behavior or cellular physiology. This work finds that expression of a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, which is governed by a quorum sensing (QS) system, impacts the expression of multiple secreted virulence factors and accounts for a documented QS-dependent antibiotic susceptibility. Although the mechanism underlying this effect is not clear, MFS orthologs with high sequence similarity from S. pneumoniae and S. porcinus were unable to substitute indicating substrate specificity of the GAS MFS gene. These findings demonstrate novel associations between the expression of a transmembrane transporter and virulence factor expression and aminoglycoside transport.",

    "abstract": "Corneal scarring is a leading cause of blindness in the world. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of corneal stromal stem cell (CSSC)-derived secretome in a mechanical debridement mouse model of corneal scarring. CSSC secretome was able to promote scarless corneal wound healing. The mechanisms include 1) dampening inflammation with reduced CD45+, CD11b+/GR1+, and CD11b+/F4/80+ inflammatory cells in the wounded corneas; 2) reducing fibrotic extracellular matrix deposition such as collagen IV, collagen 3A1, SPARC, and -SMA; 3) rescuing sensory nerves. The proteomic analysis shows upregulated proteins related to wound healing and cell adhesion which boost scarless wound healing. It also shows upregulated neuroprotective proteins in CSSC secretome related to axon guidance, neurogenesis, neuron projection development, and neuron differentiation. Four unique complement inhibitory proteins CD59, vitronectin, SERPING1, and C1QBP found in CSSC secretome contribute to reducing a complement cascade mediating cell death and membrane attacking complex autoantibodies after corneal injury. This study provides novel insights into mechanisms of stem cell secretome induced scarless corneal wound healing and neuroprotection and identifies regenerative proteins in the CSSC secretome.\n\nSignificance StatementIn this study, we report the therapeutic role of corneal stromal stem cell (CSSC) secretome for scarless corneal wound healing and corneal sensory nerve rescuing. We uncovered that CSSC secretome dampens inflammation, reduces fibrosis, induces sensory nerve regeneration, and rescues corneal cells by inhibiting the complement system in the wounded mouse corneas. This study provides pre-clinical evidence for the use of CSSC secretome as a biologic treatment for corneal scarring to prevent corneal blindness. We delineated a plethora of proteins in the CSSC secretome, which individually or in combination have the potential as future therapies for scarless corneal wound healing.",

While several ICF1 phenotypes have been linked to abnormally hypomethylated repetitive regions, the unique genomic regions responsible for the remaining disease phenotypes remain largely uncharacterized. Here we explored two ICF1 patient-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their CRISPR/Cas9 corrected clones to determine whether gene correction can overcome DNA methylation defects and related/associated changes in the epigenome of non-repetitive regions.\n\nResultsHypomethylated regions throughout the genome are highly comparable between ICF1 iPSCs carrying different DNMT3B variants, and significantly overlap with those in ICF1-peripheral blood and lymphoblastoid cell lines. These regions include large CpG island domains, as well as promoters and enhancers of several lineage-specific genes, in particular immune-related, suggesting that they are pre- marked during early development. The gene corrected ICF1 iPSCs reveal that the majority of phenotype- related hypomethylated regions re-acquire normal DNA methylation levels following editing. However, at the most severely hypomethylated regions in ICF1 iPSCs, which also display the highest increased H3K4me3 levels and enrichment of CTCF-binding motifs, the epigenetic memory persisted, and hypomethylation was uncorrected.\n\nConclusionsRestoring the catalytic activity of DNMT3B rescues the majority of the aberrant ICF1 epigenome. However, a small fraction of the genome is resilient to this reversal, highlighting the challenge of reverting disease states that are due to genome-wide epigenetic perturbations.

The interaction with CA requires a phenylalanine/glycine-containing motif in the C-terminus of NUP153. This study used molecular modeling and biochemical assays to determine the amino acids of NUP153 that are essential for its interactions with CA. Molecular dynamics, FoldX, and PyRosetta simulations delineated the minimal CA binding motif of NUP153 based on the known structure of NUP153 bound to the HIV-1 CA hexamer. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by testing the interaction of NUP153 with CA using an in vitro binding assay and a cell-based TRIM-NUP153C restriction assay. This multidisciplinary approach identified eight amino acids from P1411 to G1418 that stably engage with CA, with significant correlations between molecular models and empirical experiments. Specifically, P1411, V1414, F1415, T1416, F1417, and G1418 were confirmed as critical amino acids required to interact NUP153 with CA.\n\nIMPORTANCEHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can infect non-dividing cells by interacting with host nuclear pores. The host nuclear pore protein NUP153 directly interacts with the HIV capsid to promote viral nuclear entry. This study used a multidisciplinary approach combining computational and experimental techniques to map the essential amino acids of NUP153 required for HIV capsid interaction. This approach revealed that the HIV capsid interacts specifically with only six amino acids of NUP153, suggesting other FG-containing motifs could also interact with the capsid. Based on molecular modeling, naturally occurring polymorphisms in human and non-human primates would be predicted to prevent NUP153 interaction with capsid, potentially protecting from HIV infection.",
