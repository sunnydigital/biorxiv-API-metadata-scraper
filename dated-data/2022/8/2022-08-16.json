    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients are exposed to nighttime hypoxia during sleep by intermittent airway closure and feel daytime strong sleepiness. Strangely, insomnia co-occur in some OSA patients, which is called co-morbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). Here, we show activity responses to daytime hypoxia (DHx) in nocturnal mice were comparable to daytime sleepiness and co-occurring nighttime insomnia in COMISA. DHx reduced activity in active phase (AP) and increased following activity in activity ending phase (AEP). This down-and-up activity response (DUR) by DHx was also observed in molecular clock deficient Cry1 and Cry2 double knockout mice (CryDKO) expressing nighttime activity rise under light-dark cycle (LD) and not observed in arrhythmic CryDKO under constant darkness (DD). When daytime timing hypoxia was exposed at transition from LD to DD, about every 6 h down and up and down wavelike activity responses appeared in arrhythmic CryDKO. Results indicate this wavelike response and AP activity overlap and cause DUR in rhythmic mice. DHx increased plasma corticosterone and this increase antagonized AP activity reduction by DHx. DHx reduced forebrain adenosine and morning adenosine inhibition by caffeine induced DUR. Adenosine inhibition by caffeine or istradefylline at transition from LD to DD induced wavelike response in CryDKO. It is possible that wavelike response is damped oscillation because, interestingly, chronic caffeine treatment induced circasemidian and/or circadian activity rhythms in arrhythmic CryDKO. Evening caffeine attenuated DUR by DHx, which suggested adenosine inhibition chronotherapy may improve OSA/COMISA symptoms. Our animal model will be useful to understand COMISA.\n\nSignificanceObstructive sleep apnea patients (OSA) are exposed to nighttime hypoxia during sleep. OSA feels daytime strong sleepiness and increases risk of many diseases. Insomnia occurs in not a few OSA, which is called comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). We show here a mouse model of COMISA. In mice, daytime hypoxia exposure induced following down and up activity response (DUR), activity reduction in active phase and increase in activity ending phase, which corresponded to sleepiness and insomnia in COMISA. We found DUR was clock gene independent and might be driven by circasemidian system. Glucocorticoid and forebrain adenosine response were involved in DUR. Caffeine chronotherapy was effective in DUR. Our model may be useful to understand COMISA.",

    "abstract": "Ambiguous sensory information can lead to spontaneous alternations between perceptual states, recently shown to extend to tactile perception. The authors recently proposed a simplified form of tactile rivalry which evokes two competing percepts for a fixed difference in input amplitudes across antiphase, pulsatile stimulation of the left and right fingers. This study addresses the need for a tactile rivalry model that captures the dynamics of perceptual alternations and that incorporates the structure of the somatosensory system. The model features hierarchical processing with two stages; a first stage resolves perceptual competition, leading to perceptual alternations; and a second stage encodes perceptual interpretations. The first stage could be located downstream of brainstem nuclei and the second stage could be located within the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b). The model captures dynamical features specific to the tactile rivalry percepts and produces general characteristics of perceptual rivalry: input strength dependence of dominance times (Levelts proposition II), short-tailed skewness of dominance time distributions and the ratio of distribution moments. The presented modelling work leads to experimentally testable predictions. The same hierarchical model could generalise to account for percept formation, competition and alternations for bistable stimuli that involve pulsatile inputs from the visual and auditory domains.\n\nAuthor summaryPerceptual ambiguity involving the touch sensation has seen increased recent interest. It provides interesting opportunity to explore how our perceptual experience is resolved by dynamic computations in the brain. We recently proposed a simple form of tactile rivalry where stimuli consisted of antiphase sequences of high and low intensity pulses delivered to the right and left index fingers. The stimulus can be perceived as either one simultaneous pattern of vibration on both hands, or as a pattern of vibrations that jumps from one hand to the other, giving a sensation of apparent movement. During long presentation of the stimuli, ones perception switches every 5-20 seconds between these two interpretations, a phenomenon called tactile perceptual bistability. This study presents the first computational model for tactile bistability and is based on the structure of sensory brain areas. The model captures important characteristics of perceptual interpretations for tactile rivalry. We offer predictions in terms of how left-right tactile intensity differences are encoded and propose a location for the encoding of perceptual interpretations in sensory brain areas. The model provides a generalisable framework that can make useful predictions for future behavioural experiments with tactile and other types of stimuli.",

    "abstract": "TDP-43 is a nuclear RNA-binding protein that can undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and forms pathological insoluble aggregates in frontotemporal dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Perturbations of TDP-43 function are linked to mislocalization and neurodegeneration. By studying TDP-43 in vivo, we confirmed for the first time that TDP-43 undergoes LLPS and forms biomolecular condensates in spinal motor neurons (MNs). Importantly, we discovered that interfering with the K136 SUMOylation site of TDP-43 altered its phase separation behavior, reducing cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation. Introduction of the ALS-linked mutation G294V did not alter these LLPS characteristics, indicating that posttranslational modifications such as lysine-specific alterations can modulate TDP-43 pathogenesis through regulating phase separation. Altogether, our in vivo characterization of TDP-43 confirms the formation of dynamic nuclear TDP-43 condensates in zebrafish spinal neurons and establishes a critical platform to validate the molecular grammar of phase separation that underpins TDP-43 aggregation in ALS and other proteinopathies.",

    "abstract": "Genome architecture concerns the organisation of genes on a chromosome, and has important implications to the fidelity in which genes are encoded on the chromosome, and how the information is read by DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase. This facet of genomics did receive attention in the early epoch of genomics, but it has received less attention in contemporary genomics as attention shifts to structural and functional genomics with the goal of annotating the function of each gene in the genome. This work sought to uncover relationships between number of genes and chromosome length in a variety of bacteria and archaea species as a preamble to understanding the prevalence and importance of repetitive sequences in the genome of prokaryotic species. Aggregate results with the ensemble of prokaryotic species profiled revealed a positive linear correlation between number of genes and chromosome length. Upon dissection into the Bacteria and Archaea domains, the linear relationship described above still stands for Bacteria but starts to break down in Archaea. This suggests that repetitive sequences are more important to Archaea species, which generally have a smaller genome (1.8 to 2.8 Mbp) and fewer genes (1500 to 2400) compared to bacterial species. In comparison, the bacterial genome is larger (4 to 5.6 Mbp), and encodes more genes (3600 to 5100). Overall, the results highlight that bacterial genome are efficiently encoded with few repetitive sequences. This, however, is not true for archaeal genome, which provides another line of evidence supporting the notion that archaea are ancestral eukaryotic cells, which like the archaea also houses large repetitive sequences.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/503871v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1632506org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13e91forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12e1316org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e7381e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Short descriptionStatistical analysis across an ensemble of 59 microbial species revealed a strong linear correlation between number of genes and chromosome length.

For bats, population structure and reproductive cycles have major effects on RNA virus transmission. On Reunion Island, previous studies have shown that parturition of pregnant females and aggregation of juvenile Reunion free-tailed bats (Mormopterus francoismoutoui) are associated to major increase in the prevalence of bats shedding viruses. The synchronicity of such shedding pulses, however, is yet to be assessed, between viruses but also maternity colonies. Based on 3422 fresh faeces collected every two to five weeks during four consecutive birthing seasons, we report the prevalence of bats shedding astroviruses (AstVs), coronaviruses (CoVs), and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in two maternity colonies on Reunion Island. We found that the proportion of bats shedding viruses is highly influenced by sampling collection dates, and therefore by the seasonality of parturition. We highlight that virus shedding patterns are reproducible among years and colonies for CoVs and at a lesser extent for PMVs, but not for AstVs. We also report 1% of bats harbouring double infections, mostly CoVs and PMVs, but none shedding simultaneously AstVs, CoVs and PMVs.",

Proof of principle in-vivo electric field measurements were conducted in rodent brains using Bismuth Silicon Oxide (BSO) crystals exposed to varying levels of RF energy. Electric field measurements were calibrated and verified using in-vivo temperature measurements using optical temperature fibers alongside electromagnetic field simulations of a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) cell.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAccurate dosimetry of the absorbed radio frequency (RF) electric fields (E-Fields) by the live tissue is the keystone of environmental health considerations for this type of ever-growing non-ionizing radiation energy.

    "abstract": "T cells are crucial for efficient antigen-specific immune responses and thus their migration within the body, to inflamed tissues from circulating blood or to secondary lymphoid organs, play a very critical role. T cell extravasation in inflamed tissues depends on chemotactic cues and interaction between endothelial adhesion molecules and cellular integrins. A migrating T cell is expected to sense diverse external and membrane-intrinsic mechano-physical cues, but molecular mechanisms of such mechanosensing in cell migration are not established. We explored if the professional mechanosensor Piezo1 play any role during integrin-dependent chemotaxis of human T cells. We found that deficiency of Piezo1 in human T cells interfered with integrin-dependent cellular motility on ICAM-1-coated surface. Piezo1 recruitment at the leading edge of moving T cells is dependent on and follows focal adhesion formation at the leading edge and local increase in membrane tension on chemokine receptor activation. Piezo1 recruitment and activation, followed by calcium influx and calpain activation, in turn are crucial for the integrin LFA-1 recruitment at the leading edge of the chemotactic human T cells. Thus we find that Piezo1 activation in response to local mechanical cues constitutes a membrane-intrinsic component of the  outside-in signaling in human T cells, migrating in response to chemokines, that mediates integrin recruitment to the leading edge.",

We here present a strategy for target identification based on Proteolysis-Targeting Chimeras (PROTACs), combined with label-free quantitative proteomics. We developed a PROTAC based on the downstream Hedgehog Pathway Inhibitor-1 (HPI-1), a phenotypic screen hit with unknown cellular target. Using our Hedgehog Pathway PROTAC (HPP) we identified and validated BET bromodomains to be the cellular targets of HPI-1. Furthermore, we found that HPP-9 has a unique mechanism of action as a long-acting Hh pathway inhibitor through prolonged BET bromodomain degradation. Collectively, we provide a powerful PROTAC-based approach for target deconvolution, that has answered the longstanding question of the cellular target of HPI-1 and yielded the first PROTAC that acts on the Hh pathway.",

Here, using homemade fluorescent nanostructured cell culture surfaces, we explored the role of Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain proteins as mechanosensors of plasma membrane geometry. Our data reveal that distinct subsets of BAR proteins bind to plasma membrane deformations in a membrane curvature radius-dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that membrane curvature promotes the formation of dynamic actin structures mediated by the Rho GTPase CDC42, the F-BAR protein CIP4 and the presence of PI(4,5)P2, independently of clathrin. In addition, these actin-enriched nanodomains can serve as platforms to regulate receptor signaling as they appear to contain Interferon {gamma} receptor (IFN{gamma}-R) and to lead to the partial inhibition of IFN{gamma}-induced Janus-activated tyrosine kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) signaling.",

    "abstract": "Circulation of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRB) in healthcare facilities is a major public health problem. These settings have been greatly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, notably due to surges in COVID-19 caseloads and the implementation of infection control measures. Yet collateral impacts of pandemic COVID-19 on MRB epidemiology remain poorly understood. Here, we present a dynamic transmission model in which SARS-CoV-2 and MRB co-circulate among patients and staff in a hospital population in an early pandemic context. Responses to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks are captured mechanistically, reflecting impacts on factors relevant for MRB transmission, including contact behaviour, hand hygiene compliance, antibiotic prescribing and population structure. In a first set of simulations, broad parameter ranges are accounted for, representative of diverse bacterial species and hospital settings. On average, COVID-19 control measures coincide with MRB prevention, including fewer incident cases and fewer cumulative person-days of patient MRB colonization. However, surges in COVID-19 caseloads favour MRB transmission and lead to increased rates of antibiotic resistance, especially in the absence of concomitant control measures. In a second set of simulations, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli are simulated in specific hospital wards and pandemic response scenarios. Antibiotic resistance dynamics are highly context-specific in these cases, and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks significantly impact bacterial epidemiology only in facilities with high underlying risk of bacterial transmission. Crucially, antibiotic resistance burden is reduced in facilities with timelier, more effective implementation of COVID-19 control measures. This highlights the control of antibiotic resistance as an important collateral benefit of robust pandemic preparedness.\n\nSignificance StatementImpacts of COVID-19 on the spread of antibiotic resistance are poorly understood. Here, an epidemiological model accounting for the simultaneous spread of SARS-CoV-2 and antibiotic-resistant bacteria is presented. The model is tailored to healthcare settings during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, and accounts for hand hygiene, inter-individual contact behaviour, and other factors relevant for pathogen spread. Simulations demonstrate that public health policies enacted to slow the spread of COVID-19 also tend to limit bacterial transmission. However, surges in COVID-19 cases simultaneously select for higher rates of antibiotic resistance. Selection for resistance is thus mitigated by prompt implementation of effective COVID-19 prevention policies. This highlights the control of antibiotic resistance as an important collateral benefit of pandemic preparedness.",

Several million raw genome sequencing runs are now publicly available. We sought to survey these datasets for intrahost variation to study emerging mutations of concern. We developed iSKIM (\"intrahost SARS-CoV-2 k-mer identification method\") to relatively quickly and efficiently screen the many SARS-CoV-2 datasets to identify intrahost mutations belonging to lineages of concern. Certain mutations surged in frequency as intrahost minor variants just prior to, or while lineages of concern arose. The Spike N501Y change common to several VoCs was found as a minor variant in 834 samples as early as October 2020. This coincides with the timing of the first detected samples with this mutation in the Alpha/B.1.1.7 and Beta/B.1.351 lineages. Using iSKIM, we also found that Spike L452R was detected as an intrahost minor variant as early as September 2020, prior to the observed rise of the Epsilon/B.1.429/B.1.427 lineages in late 2020. iSKIM rapidly screens for mutations of interest in raw data, prior to genome assembly, and can be used to detect increases in intrahost variants, potentially providing an early indication of novel variant spread.",

    "abstract": "Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) hold great promise in regenerative medicine; however, few algorithms of quality control at the earliest stages of differentiation have been established. Despite lipids having known functions in cell signaling, their role in pluripotency maintenance and lineage specification is underexplored. We investigated changes in iPSC lipid profiles during initial loss of pluripotency over the course of spontaneous differentiation using co-registration of confocal microscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging. We identified lipids that are highly informative of the temporal stage of the differentiation and can reveal lineage bifurcation occurring metabolically. Several phosphatidylinositol species emerged from machine learning analysis as early metabolic markers of pluripotency loss, preceding changes in Oct4. Manipulation of phospholipids via PI 3-kinase inhibition during differentiation manifested in spatial reorganization of the colony and elevated expression of NCAM-1. In addition, continuous inhibition of phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase during differentiation resulted in increased pluripotency maintenance. Our machine learning analysis highlights the predictive power of metabolic metrics for evaluating lineage specification in the initial stages of spontaneous iPSC differentiation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundHuntingtons disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disease which is triggered by a large expansion of CAG nucleotides in the HTT gene. While the CAG expansion linearly correlates with the age of disease onset in HD, twin-studies and cohorts of Juvenile Onset HD (JOHD) patients have shown other factors influence the progression of HD. Thus, it would be of interest to identify molecular biomarkers which indicate predisposition to the development of HD, and as microRNAs (miRNAs) circulate in bio-fluids they would be particularly useful biomarkers. We explored a large HD miRNA-mRNA expression dataset (GSE65776) to establish appropriate questions that could be addressed using Machine Learning (ML). We sought sets of features (mRNAs or miRNAs) to predict HD or WT samples from aged or young mouse cortex samples, and we asked if a set of features could predict predisposition to HD or WT genotypes by training models on aged samples and testing the models on young samples. Several models were created using ADAboost, ExtraTrees, GaussianNB and Random Forest, and the best performing models were further analysed using AUC curves and PCA plots. Finally, genes used to train our miRNA-based predisposition model were mined from HD patient bio-fluid samples.\n\nResultsOur testing accuracies were between 66-100% and AUC scores were between 31-100%. We generated several excellent models with testing accuracies >80% and AUC scores >90%. We also identified homologues of mmu-miR-154-5p, mmu-miR-181a-5p, mmu-miR-212-3p, mmu-miR-378b, mmu-miR-382-5p and mmu-miR-770-5p from our miRNA-based predisposition model to be circulating in HD patient blood samples at p.values of <0.05.\n\nConclusionsWe generated several age-based models which could differentiate between HD and WT samples, including an aged mRNA-based model with a 100% AUC score, an aged miRNA-based model with a 92% AUC score and an aged miRNA-based model with a 96% AUC score. We also identified several miRNAs used to train our miRNA-based predisposition model which were detectable in HD patient blood samples, which suggests they could be potential candidates for use as non-invasive biomarkers for HD research.",

Both theory and simulations confirm that the shear stress follows the universal power law [Formula] for the brush bilayers with interpenetration and in the absence of the interpenetration, the shear stress scales linearly with the shear rate. It is also revealed that the presence of explicit solvent molecules prevents the brushes to form and interpenetration zone and therefore with explicit solvents the shear stress scales linearly with shear rate. Therefore, this study strongly confirms that there is no sublinear regime in the world of polymer brush bilayer, neither by solvents nor by hydrodynamic effects. As long as there is an interpenetration zone, the superlinear regime dominates and in the absence of the interpenetration zone the linear regime dominates. Therefore, polymer brushes are not a good candidate for lubrication and all works suggesting that this system is a super lubricant are completely wrong.",

    "abstract": "Unlike immature neurons and neurons from the peripheral nervous system (PNS), mature neurons from the central nervous system (CNS) cannot regenerate after injury. In the past 15 years, huge progress has been made to identify molecules and pathways necessary for neuroprotection and/or regeneration after CNS injury. In most regenerative models, phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (p-RPS6) is upregulated in neurons, which is often associated with an activation of the mTOR pathway. However, the exact contribution of post-translational modifications of this ribosomal protein in CNS regeneration remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that RPS6 phosphorylation is essential for PNS and CNS regeneration. We show that this phosphorylation is induced during the preconditioning effect in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and that it is controlled by the p90S6 kinase RSK2. Our results reveal that RSK2 controls the preconditioning effect and that the RSK2-RPS6 axis is key for this process, as well as for PNS regeneration. Finally, we demonstrate that RSK2 promotes CNS regeneration in the dorsal column and allows functional recovery. Our data establish the critical role of RPS6 phosphorylation controlled by RSK2 in CNS regeneration and give new insights into the mechanism related to axon growth and circuit formation after traumatic lesion.",

Encoding prediction error computed from the mismatch between actual input and predictions based on experience is considered an effective strategy for sensory perception in the brain. However, it remains unknown how predictive computation is implemented in the hierarchy of neural circuits in cortical areas. Here, we monitored dorsal cortex-wide neural activity using a wide-field Ca2+ imaging technique when mice encountered visuomotor mismatches in virtual reality. Posterior medial cortical areas sequentially responded to the visuomotor mismatches. The magnitude of these responses was associated with the predictability of the mismatch events. Granger causality and anatomical analysis demonstrated experience-dependent information flow structure underlying the mismatch signal transmission across the cortex. Our results reveal that the subnetworks in posteromedial cortical areas process the prediction errors in a hierarchical manner.",

    "abstract": "T helper 9 cells (TH9) are key drivers of allergic tissue inflammation. They are characterized by the expression of type 2 cytokines, such as IL-9 and IL-13, and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-{gamma}) transcription factor. However, the functional role of PPAR-{gamma} in human TH9 cells remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that PPAR-{gamma} drives activation-induced glycolysis, which, in turn, specifically promotes the expression of IL-9, but not IL-13, in an mTORC1-dependent manner. In vitro and ex vivo experiments on skin samples of allergic contact dermatitis showed that the PPAR-{gamma}-mTORC1-IL-9 pathway was active in TH9 cells in human skin inflammation. Additionally, we found that tissue glucose levels were dynamically regulated in acute allergic skin inflammation, suggesting that in situ glucose availability is linked to distinct immunological signals in vivo. Furthermore, paracrine IL-9 induced the lactate transporter MCT1 in IL-9R+ TH cells, where it increased aerobic glycolysis and proliferative capacity. Taken together, our findings delineate a hitherto unknown relationship between PPAR-{gamma}-dependent glucose metabolism and the pathogenic effector function of human TH9 cells.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=84 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/503972v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ce684borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12121acorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@29d712org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e71117_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, its off- target effects pose a major limitation for applications requiring high specificity. Approaches developed to date to mitigate this effect, including any of the increased fidelity (i.e., high-fidelity) SpCas9 variants, only provide efficient editing on a relatively small fraction of targets without detectable off-targets. Upon addressing this problem, we have revealed a rather unexpected cleavability ranking of target sequences, and a cleavage rule that governs the on-target and off-target cleavage of increased fidelity SpCas9 variants but not that of SpCas9-NG or xCas9. As a consequence of this rule, each target needs a matching-fidelity, optimal variant for efficient cleavage without detectable off-target effects. By exploiting this finding, we have developed an extended set of increased fidelity variants spanning across a wide range, with differences in fidelity small enough to comprise an optimal variant for any target, irrespective of its cleavability ranking. We have demonstrated efficient editing with maximum specificity even on those targets that have been challenged but failed in previous studies.",

Here we identified a batokine we named as Breg acting as a key regulator for adipose thermogenesis and glucose homeostasis. Breg expression is adipose-specific and highly brown fat-enriched, and its secretion is stimulated by {beta}3-adrenergic activation. Gain-of-functional studies collectively showed that secreted Breg promotes adipose thermogenesis, lowers glucose level, and protects against obesity. Adipose-specific Breg knockout mice are defective in white fat browning, and are susceptible to high fat diet-induced obesity and hyperglycemia, demonstrating the physiological importance of this batokine in energy metabolism. Mechanistically, Breg binds to a putative receptor on adipocyte surface and activates protein kinase A independently of {beta}-adrenergic signaling. These results establish Breg as a major upstream signaling component in thermogenesis and offer a potential avenue for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.",

Several large-effect genes with cis-acting variants affecting mRNA expression are mostly responsible for tocochromanol variation in maize grain, with other relevant associated quantitative trait loci (QTL) yet to be fully resolved. Leveraging existing genomic and transcriptomic information for maize inbreds could improve prediction when selecting for higher vitamin E content. Here, we first evaluated a multikernel genomic best linear unbiased prediction (MK-GBLUP) approach for modeling known QTL in the prediction of nine tocochromanol grain phenotypes (12-21 QTL per trait) within and between two panels of 1,462 and 242 maize inbred lines. On average, MK-GBLUP models improved predictive abilities by 7.0 to 13.6% when compared to GBLUP. In a second approach with a subset of 545 lines from the larger panel, the highest average improvement in predictive ability relative to GBLUP was achieved with a multi-trait GBLUP model (15.4%) that had a tocochromanol phenotype and transcript abundances in developing grain for a few large-effect candidate causal genes (1-3 genes per trait) as multiple response variables. Taken together, our study illustrates the enhancement of prediction models when informed by existing biological knowledge pertaining to QTL and candidate causal genes.\n\nCore IdeasO_LIWith varying levels of vitamin E activity, tocochromanols found in maize grain are essential for human health\nC_LIO_LISelecting for higher vitamin E content in maize grain can be enhanced with genomic prediction\nC_LIO_LIPrediction models leveraging existing biological knowledge were evaluated in two panels of maize inbred lines\nC_LIO_LIMultikernel prediction models based on previously identified QTL improved predictive ability\nC_LIO_LIA multi-trait prediction model that had transcript abundances of a few large-effect causal genes performed the best\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Current genetic methods of population assessment in conservation biology have been challenged by genome-scale analyses due to their quantitatively novel insights. These analyses include assessments of runs-of-homozygosity (ROH), genomic evolutionary rate profiling (GERP), and mutational load. Here, we aim to elucidate the relationships between these measures using three divergent ungulates: the white-tailed deer, caribou, and mountain goat. The white-tailed deer is currently expanding, while caribou are in the midst of a significant decline. Mountain goats remain stable, having suffered a large historical bottleneck. We assessed genome-wide signatures of inbreeding using the inbreeding coefficient F and %ROH (FROH) and identified evolutionarily constrained regions with GERP. Mutational load was estimated by identifying mutations in highly constrained elements (CEs) and sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT) mutations. Our results show that F and FROH are higher in mountain goats than in caribou and white-tailed deer. Given the extended bottleneck and low Ne of the mountain goat, this supports the idea that the genome-wide effects of demographic change take time to accrue. Similarly, we found that mountain goats possess more highly constrained CEs and the lowest dN/dS values, both of which are indicative of greater purifying selection; this is also reflected by fewer mutations in CEs and deleterious mutations identified by SIFT. In contrast, white-tailed deer presented the highest mutational load with both metrics, in addition to dN/dS, while caribou were intermediate. Our results demonstrate that extended bottlenecks may lead to reduced diversity and increased FROH in ungulates, but not necessarily the accumulation of deleterious alleles, likely due to the purging of deleterious alleles in small populations.",

    "abstract": "Telomere maintenance in neuroblastoma is linked to poor outcome and caused by either TERT activation or through alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). In contrast to TERT activation, commonly caused by genomic rearrangements or MYCN amplification, ALT is less well understood. Alterations at the ATRX locus are key drivers of ALT but only present in [~]50% of ALT tumors.\n\nTo identify potential new pathways to telomere maintenance, we investigate allele-specific gene dosage effects from whole genomes and transcriptomes in 115 primary neuroblastomas. We show that copy-number dosage deregulates telomere maintenance, genomic stability, and neuronal pathways and identify upregulation of variants of histone H3 and H2A as a potential alternative pathway to ALT. We investigate the interplay between TERT activation, overexpression and copy-number dosage and reveal loss of imprinting at the RTL1 gene associated with poor clinical outcome.\n\nThese results highlight the importance of gene dosage in key oncogenic mechanisms in neuroblastoma.",

    "abstract": "Cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) is the redox partner of steroid and drug-metabolizing cytochromes P450 located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Mutations in POR cause a broad range of metabolic disorders. The POR variant rs17853284 (P228L) identified by genome sequencing has been linked to lower testosterone levels and reduced P450 activities. We expressed POR wild type and the P228L variant in bacteria, purified the proteins, and performed protein stability and catalytic functional studies. Variant P228L affected the stability of the protein as evidenced by lower unfolding temperatures and higher sensitivity to urea denaturation. A significant reduction of model electron acceptors was observed with POR P228L while activities of CYP3A4 were reduced by 25%, and activities of CYP3A5, and CYP2C9 were reduced by more than 40% compared to WT POR. The 17,20 lyase activity of CYP17A1 responsible for production of main androgen precursor dehydroepiandrosterone, was reduced to 27% of WT in presence of P228L variant of POR. Based on in silico and in vitro studies we predict that the change of proline to leucine may change the rigidity of the protein, causing conformational changes in POR, leading to altered electron transfer to redox partners. A single amino acid change can affect protein stability and cause a severe reduction in POR activity. Molecular characterization of individual POR mutations is crucial for a better understanding of the impact on different redox partners of POR.",

    "abstract": "Skin ageing has been widely associated with the formation and presence of increasing quantities of senescent cells, the presence of which are thought to reduce cell renewal. This study aimed to identify key factors influencing fibroblast and skin aging in European males using RNA-seq data. Key differences in study designs included known sources of biological differences (sex, age, ethnicity), experimental differences, and environmental factors known to accelerate skin ageing (smoking, UV exposure) as well as study specific batch effects which complicated the analysis. To overcome these complications samples were stratified by these factors and differential expression assessed using Salmon and CuffDiff. Functional enrichment and consistency across studies, stratifications and tools identified age related alterations in the transcriptomes of fibroblasts and skin. Functional enrichment of results identified alterations in protein targeting to membranes and the ER, and altered calcium homeostasis in aged fibroblasts. Extension to skin controlled for differences in fibroblast culturing methods confirming transient age related alterations in intracellular calcium homeostasis. In middle aged males (40-65) increased keratinisation, skin, epithelial and epidermal development was seen in conjunction with alterations to ER Ca2+ uptake, leading to the identification of related processes including; an unfolded protein response, altered metabolism, increased MMP expression, and altered Ca2+ handling, which were further exacerbated by UV-exposure. Interestingly the genes and processes subsequently decreased in old males (> 65), which exhibited signs of increased senescence. Extension to Illumina 450k array data from ageing skin uncovered evidence of epigenetic regulation; genes and isoforms with overlapping differentially methylated CpGs were differentially expressed. Smoking led to additional enrichment of genes relating to tissue development, cell adhesion, vasculature development, peptide cross-linking, calcium homeostasis, cancer and senescence. The results consistently identified alterations in ER and golgi Ca2+ uptake, which disrupt intracellular and extracellular calcium gradients that regulate metabolic and differentiation signalling in skin and fibroblasts, leading to age related declines skin structure and function. Interestingly many diseases and infections with overlapping molecular consequences, (ER Ca2+ stress, reduced protein targeting to membranes) including COVID-19 are identified by the analysis, suggesting that COVID-19 infection compounds pre-existing cellular stresses in aged males, which could help explain higher COVID-19 mortality rates in aged males, as well as highlighting potential ways to reduce them.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposePlatelet function during inflammation is dependent on activation by endogenous nucleotides. Non-canonical signalling via the P2Y1 receptor is important for these non-thrombotic functions of platelets. However, apart from ADP, the role of other endogenous nucleotides acting as agonists at P2Y1 receptors is unknown. This study compared the effects of ADP, Ap3A, NAD+, ADP-ribose, and Up4A on platelet functions contributing to inflammation or haemostasis.\n\nExperimental ApproachPlatelets obtained from healthy human volunteers were incubated with ADP, Ap3A, NAD+, ADP-ribose or Up4A, with aggregation and fibrinogen binding measured (examples of function during haemostasis) or before exposure to fMLP to measure platelet chemotaxis (an inflammatory function). In silico molecular docking of these nucleotides to the binding pocket of P2Y1 receptors was then assessed.\n\nKey ResultsPlatelet aggregation and binding to fibrinogen induced by ADP was not mimicked by NAD+, ADP-ribose, and Up4A. However, these endogenous nucleotides induced P2Y1-dependent platelet chemotaxis, an effect that required RhoA and Rac-1 activity, but not canonical PLC activity. Analysis of molecular docking of the P2Y1 receptor revealed distinct differences of amino acid interactions and depth of fit within the binding pocket by Ap3A, NAD+, ADP-ribose or Up4A compared to ADP.\n\nConclusion and ImplicationsPlatelet function (aggregation vs motility) can be differentially modulated by biased-agonist activation of P2Y1 receptors. This may be due to the character of the ligand-binding pocket interaction. This has implications for future therapeutic strategies aimed to suppress platelet activation during inflammation without affecting haemostasis as is the requirement of current ant-platelet drugs.",

    "abstract": "Humans have a limited amount of cognitive resources to process various cognitive operations at a given moment. The Source of Activation Confusion (SAC) model of episodic memory proposes that resources are consumed during each processing and once depleted they need time to recover gradually. This has been supported by a series of behavioral findings in the past. However, the neural substrate of the resources is not known. In the present study, over an existing EEG dataset of a free recall task (Kahana et al., 2022), we provided a neural index reflecting the amount of cognitive resources available for forming new memory traces. Unique to our approach, we obtained the neural index not through correlating neural patterns with behavior outcomes or experimental conditions, but by demonstrating its alignment with a latent quantity of cognitive resources inferred from the SAC model. In addition, we showed that the identified neural index can be used to propose novel hypothesis regarding other long-term memory phenomena. Specifically, we found that according to the neural index, neural encoding patterns for subsequently recalled items correspond to greater available cognitive resources compared with that for subsequently unrecalled items. This provides a mechanistic account for the long-established subsequent memory effects (SMEs, i.e. differential neural encoding patterns between subsequently recalled versus subsequently unrecalled items), which has been previously associated with attention, fatigue and properties of the stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Impulsivity is a multidimensional construct, but the relationships between its constructs and their respective underlying dopaminergic underpinnings in the normal population remain unclear. A large cohort of Roman high-(RHA) and low- (RLA) avoidance rats were tested for impulsive action and risky decision-making in the rat gambling task, and then for delay discounting in the delay discounting task to concurrently measure the relationships among the three constructs of impulsivity using a within-subject design. Then, we evaluated the effects of dopaminergic drugs on the three constructs of impulsivity, considering innate differences in impulsive behaviors at baseline. Risky decision-making and delay discounting were positively correlated, indicating that both constructs of impulsive choice are related. Impulsive action positively correlated with risky decision-making but not with delay discounting, suggesting partial overlap between impulsive action and impulsive choice. RHAs showed a more impulsive phenotype in the three constructs of impulsivity compared to RLAs, demonstrating the comorbid nature of impulsivity in a normal population. While amphetamine increased impulsive action and had no effects on risky decision-making regardless of baseline levels of impulsivity, it decreased delay discounting but only in high impulsive RHAs. Conversely, the D1R agonist SKF81297, D3R agonist PD128907 and D2/3R partial agonist aripiprazole decreased impulsive action irrespective of baseline levels of impulsivity, whereas D2/3R agonism with quinpirole decreased it exclusively in high impulsive RHAs. Risky decision-making was increased by SKF81297 and quinpirole but not PD128907 and aripiprazole, with quinpirole producing baseline-dependent effects, increasing risky decision-making only in low impulsive RLAs. Finally, while SKF81297, PD128907 and aripiprazole increased delay discounting irrespective of baseline levels of impulsivity, quinpirole decreased it in low impulsive RLAs only. These findings indicate that the acute effects of dopamine drugs were partially overlapping across dimensions of impulsivity, and that only D2/3R agonism showed baseline-dependent effects on the three constructs of impulsivity.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages are highly dynamic innate immune cells that adopt temporary phenotypes, known as polarization states, in response to changing environmental signals to combat microbial infection and contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. During the early stages of an infection, exposure to interferon-gamma (IFN{gamma}) and microbial ligands induce M1 polarization, a heightened proinflammatory anti-microbial state, by regulating the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). While this response must be sufficiently vigorous to ensure the successful clearance of invading pathogens, it must also be spatially and temporally restricted to prevent uncontrolled inflammation that could result in tissue damage and disease. This is controlled by a variety of cell-extrinsic and -intrinsic mechanisms, including the expression of CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with glutamic acid/aspartic acid-rich carboxyl-terminal domain 2 (CITED2), a transcriptional coregulator that limits IFN{gamma}-stimulated proinflammatory gene expression by inhibiting STAT1- and IRF1-regulated ISGs. In this study, we show that CITED1, another member of the CITED family of proteins, is itself an ISG and is expressed in a STAT1-dependent manner, and that IFN{gamma} stimulates the nuclear accumulation of fluorescently tagged CITED1 proteins. In contrast to CITED2, ectopic expression of CITED1 enhanced the expression of a subset of ISGs, including Ccl2, Ifit3b, Isg15, and Oas2. This effect was reversed in a Cited1 null cell line produced by CRISPR-based genomic editing. Collectively, these data show that CITED1 helps to maintain proinflammatory gene expression during periods of prolonged IFN{gamma} exposure and suggests a distinct and antagonistic relationship between CITED proteins in the regulation of macrophage inflammatory function.",

This is important because immature Tn are a major component of peripheral immune tolerance in newborns and under lymphopenia. In this study we demonstrate that TMRM, a mitochondrial membrane potential marker, could be applied to rapidly identify an immature Tn cell population in the periphery. Applying this marker to perform metabolic and proteomic analysis, we show that immature Tn cells maintain accelerated methionine cycle in respect to mature Tn. This unique metabolic state was associated with restricted Tbx21 locus and diminished immune response in vitro and in vivo. Following our findings, we demonstrate that inhibition of methionine cycle leads to rapid functional maturation of Tn and recovery of immune response to stimuli. Our work provides insight into the way the rate of methionine cycling regulates T cell maturation, opening a path for metabolic manipulation of immune tolerance.",

We developed a bioinformatics strategy to find disease-related SNVs located into PPRs simultaneously overlapping with putative G4-forming sequences (PQSs). We studied five G4-Vars disturbing in vitro the folding and stability of the G4s located into PPRs, which had been formerly associated with sporadic Alzheimers disease (GRIN2B), a severe familiar coagulopathy (F7), atopic dermatitis (CSF2), myocardial infarction (SIRT1), and deafness (LHFPL5). Results obtained in cellulo for GRIN2B and F7 suggest that the G4 disruption due to the identified G4-Vars affect the transcription and are responsible for the mentioned diseases.

Experimental evidence, primarily from non-mammalian model systems, indicates that the stable formation of this group of cells requires the activation of a set of key transcription factors (TFs). This critical event is challenging to probe in mammals and, quantitatively, little is known regarding the regulation of the transition of cells to this ocular fate. Using optic vesicle organoids to model the onset of the EF, we generate timecourse transcriptomic data allowing us to identify dynamic gene-expression programs that characterise this cellular-state transition. Integrating this with chromatin accessibility data suggests a direct role of canonical EFTFs in regulating these gene-expression changes, and high-lights candidate cis-regulatory elements through which these TFs act. Finally, we begin to test a subset of these candidate enhancer elements, within the organoid system, by perturbing the underlying DNA sequence and measuring transcriptomic changes during EF activation.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWe propose an interactive visual analytics approach to characterizing and comparing patient subgroups (i.e., cohorts). Despite having the same disease and similar demographic characteristics, patients respond differently to therapy. One reason for this is the vast number of variables in the genome that influence a patients outcome. Nevertheless, most existing tools do not offer effective means of identifying the attributes that differ most, or look at them in isolation and thus ignore combinatorial effects. To fill this gap, we present Kokiri, a visual analytics approach that aims to separate cohorts based on user-selected data, ranks attributes by their importance in distinguishing between cohorts, and visualizes cohort overlaps and separability. With our approach, users can additionally characterize the homogeneity and outliers of a cohort. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we integrated Kokiri into the Coral cohort analysis tool to compare and characterize lung cancer patient cohorts.",

    "abstract": "Control of cellular identity involves coordination of developmental programs with environmental factors such as nutrient availability, suggesting that modulating aspects of metabolism could enable therapeutically relevant changes in cell fate. We show that nucleotide depletion facilitates gene expression changes towards a new cell fate by perturbing DNA replication in models of acute myeloid leukemia, a cancer characterized by a differentiation blockade. This transition starts in S phase and is independent of replication stress signaling and DNA damage signaling pathways. Moreover, it occurs despite sustained oncogene-driven expression of the progenitor program and is accompanied by limited changes in chromatin accessibility. Altering lineage-determining transcription factor expression redirects cell fate progression towards an alternate fate upon replication stress, suggesting that perturbing DNA replication allows cells to mobilize primed maturation programs. Our work, along with other findings in diverse systems, suggests a conserved mechanism by which metabolic changes can orchestrate cell fate transitions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMarfan syndrome, caused by mutations in the gene for the extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein fibrillin-1, leads to thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs). Phenotypic modulation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and ECM remodeling are characteristics of both non-syndromic and Marfan aneurysms. The ECM protein fibronectin (FN) is elevated in the tunica media of TAAs and amplifies inflammatory signaling in endothelial and SMCs through its main receptor, integrin 5{beta}1. We investigated the role of integrin 5-specific signals in Marfan mice in which the cytoplasmic domain of integrin 5 was replaced with that of integrin 2 (denoted 5/2 chimera).\n\nMethodsWe used 5/2 chimera mouse crossed with Fbn1mgR/mgR genetic background (mgR, a mouse model of Marfan syndrome) to compare the survival rate and pathogenesis of TAAs among wild type, 5/2, mgR and 5/2; mgR mice. Further biochemical and microscopic analysis of porcine and mouse aortic SMCs allowed us to identify the molecular mechanisms by which FN affects SMCs and subsequent development of TAAs.\n\nResultsFN was elevated in the thoracic aortas from Marfan patients, in non-syndromic aneurysms and in the mgR mouse model of Marfan syndrome. The 5/2 mutation greatly prolonged survival of Marfan mice, with improved elastic fiber integrity, mechanical properties, SMC density, and SMC contractile gene expression. Furthermore, in vitro, plating of wild-type, but not 5/2, SMCs on FN decreased contractile gene expression and activated inflammatory pathways. These effects correlated with increased NF-kB activation and immune cell infiltration in the mgR aortas, which was rescued in the 5/2 mgR aortas.\n\nConclusionsFN-integrin 5 signaling is a significant driver of TAA in the mgR mouse model. This pathway warrants further investigation as a therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "A new subgenus, Subg. Disticha is erected for 14 species of simple-leaved Cola sharing unique characters within the genus which are presumed synapomorphies: distichous phyllotaxy; petioles lacking pulvini; petioles of uniformly short length, <10 mm long; male flowers with short androphores <1(- 2) mm long; stamens 4 - 5; stem indumentum where present, dominated by short simple translucent hairs (except in C. philipi-jonesii where stellate), and in many species dark purple to black stems with contrasting bright white lenticels. All species have fruit with small globose, unsculptured orange mericarps c. 1 cm diam. (where fruits are known). The species of this subgenus range from SE Nigeria in the west to coastal Kenya and Tanzania in the east and Malawi in the south, but are absent from the Congo basin. Species diversity is highest in the Cross-Sanaga and Eastern Arc-Coastal Forest biogeographic areas, consistent with these taxa being Pleistocene refuge species. The species are mainly monoecious, but dioecy cannot yet be ruled out in some species. In two species where sufficient material was available for investigation (Cola chlorantha, C. roy), the simple cymes were found to be bisexual, the terminal flower being female, the two lateral flowers often being male, a pattern previously unreported in the genus. All species are understorey shrubs or small trees of evergreen lowland or submontane forest, except C. uloloma of coastal semi-deciduous forest in E Africa and which is unique in showing xerophilic characteristics. The species can be divided into group A: five species mainly in E Africa with rapidly glabrescent or glabrous stems, conspicuously asymmetric leaves, few-flowered, pedunculate cymes (C. uloloma, C. chlorantha, C. roy sp.nov., C.\"udzungwa\", C. asymmetrica sp. nov.); group B: in Lower Guinea (Atlantic coast of Africa) with hairy stems, symmetric or inconspicuously asymmetric leaves, sessile, fasciculate inflorescences: (Cola mayimbensis, C. philipi-jonesii, C. metallica, C.moussavoui, C. stigmatosa, C. takamanda sp.nov. C. toyota sp. nov, C. \"campo-maan\", C. zanaga sp. nov.). Of the seven new species to science, two are named informally since the material is so incomplete (sterile), and five are formally named. Species diversity is highest in Cameroon and Tanzania, each with four species, followed by Gabon with three species. It is expected that additional new species will be found in poorly-surveyed surviving evergreen forest habitat in each of these three countries. Conservation assessments are given for each species using the IUCN 2012 standard. All species are considered threatened, with ten species being Critically Endangered (the highest category of threat), each known from a single location, with their forest habitat threatened mainly by clearance for agriculture.",

    "abstract": "During autophagosome biogenesis, the incorporation of transmembrane proteins into the expanding phagophore is not readily observed. In addition, the membrane surface area of the organelle expands rapidly, while the volume of the autophagosome is kept low. Several recent studies have suggested a model of membrane expansion that explains how these attributes are maintained. The autophagosome expands predominantly through the direct protein-mediated transfer of lipids through the lipid transfer protein ATG2. As these lipids are only introduced into the cytoplasmic-facing leaflet of the expanding phagophore, full membrane growth also requires lipid scramblase activity. ATG9 has been demonstrated to harbor scramblase activity and is essential to autophagosome formation, however if and when it is integrated into mammalian autophagosomes remains unclear. Here we show that in the absence of lipid transport, ATG9 vesicles are already fully competent to collect proteins normally found on mature autophagosomes, including LC3-II. Further, through the novel use of styrene-maleic acid lipid particles as a nanoscale interrogation of protein organization on intact membranes, we show that ATG9 is fully integrated in the same membranes as LC3-II, even on maturing autophagosomes. The ratios of these two proteins at different stages of maturation demonstrate that ATG9 proteins are not continuously integrated, but rather are present on the seed vesicles only and become diluted in the rapidly expanding autophagosome membrane. Thus, ATG9 vesicles are the seed membrane from which mammalian autophagosomes form.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe social media site Twitter has been widely embraced in medical circles for its ability to connect individuals and support rapid information sharing. Critics say that the messages shared may not accurately reflect what was said and that sharing meeting content could devalue conferences themselves. It is unclear how it is used at SSIEM and what value it may bring.\n\nMETHODSTwitters tweetdeck software was used to find all tweets containing the conference  hashtag #SSIEM2018. All tweets were reviewed to identify the author, see what had been shared and count replies, likes and retweets. Authors were grouped by professional background and tweet content was broken down by type of material shared and theme.\n\nRESULTS122 relevant tweets were sent during the fortnight at the beginning of September 2018, creating over 400,000 impressions. There were a further 73 replies with approximately 13 engagements (likes, replies or retweets) per tweet. 36 people wrote tweets (rate: 3.4 per person [1-33]). One quarter of the tweets shared poster content and over one third of tweets related to Phenylketonuria materials. 50 of the tweets were produced by just two accounts, both intended to provide information to patients and their families.\n\nDISCUSSIONTweets where no hashtag was used cannot be identified and restrictions within Twitter prevent certain analyses on tweet data greater than 30 days old. However, Twitter uptake within metabolic medicine is significantly behind other specialities where conference tweets can exceed 20,000. Information shared is typically intended for patients rather than other health professionals; this suggests a different uptake to more mainstream specialities. Presenting teams should be aware that their work may be received directly by patients and families and consider how best to present their messages for all who may receive them.",

Yet, the extent to which these systems recruit shared versus separate neural pathways is poorly understood. To elucidate these pathways, we separately studied error-based (EL) and reinforcement-based (RL) motor learning in two functional MRI experiments in the same human subjects. We find that EL and RL occupy opposite ends of neural axis broadly separating cerebellar and striatal connectivity, respectively, with somatomotor cortex, and that alignment of this axis to each task is related to performance. Further, we identify a separate neural axis that is associated with strategy use during EL, and show that the expression of this same axis during RL predicts better performance. Together, these results offer a macroscale view of the common versus distinct neural architectures supporting different learning systems.",

    "abstract": "Sponges are singular players in the marine silicon cycle. They accumulate vast stocks of biogenic silica within their bodies and in the sediments beneath them over long periods. These silica stocks are recycled at slow rates, much slower than that of other silicon users such as diatoms. The observation of an abrupt change in sponge biomass in a temperate coastal ecosystem led us to study the effect of nudibranch (Doris verrucosa) predation on the silicon budget of a sponge (Hymeniacidon perlevis) population on an annual scale. Predation rates and the associated sponge silicon fluxes were determined. After 5 months of predation, the abundance of sponge individuals did not change but their biomass decreased by 95%, of which 48% can be explained by nudibranch predation. About 97% of sponge spicules ingested by nudibranchs while feeding was excreted, most of them unbroken, implying a high rate of sponge silica deposition in the surrounding sediments. After predation, sponges partially recovered their biomass stocks within 7 months. This involved a rapid growth rate and large consumption of dissolved silicon, with the highest rates ever recorded unexpectedly occurring when the dissolved silicon concentration was minimal in seawater (< 1.5 M). These findings reveal that the annual sponge predation-recovery cycle triggers unprecedented intra-annual changes in sponge silicon stocks and boosts nutrient cycling. They also highlight the need for intra-annual data collection to understand the dynamics and resilience of sponge ecosystem functioning.",

    "abstract": "The availability of AlphaFold2 has led to great excitement in the scientific community - particularly among drug hunters - due to the ability of the algorithm to predict protein structures with high accuracy. However, beyond globally accurate protein structure prediction, it remains to be determined whether ligand binding sites are predicted with sufficient accuracy in these structures to be useful in supporting computationally driven drug discovery programs. We explored this question by performing free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations on a set of well-studied protein-ligand complexes, where AlphaFold2 predictions were performed by removing all templates with >30% identity to the target protein from the training set. We observed that in most cases, the {Delta}{Delta}G values for ligand transformations calculated with FEP, using these prospective AlphaFold2 structures, were comparable in accuracy to the corresponding calculations previously carried out using X-ray structures. We conclude that under the right circumstances, AlphaFold2 modeled structures are accurate enough to be used by physics-based methods such as FEP, in typical lead optimization stages of a drug discovery program.",

    "abstract": "E-cigarette (EC) and vaping use continue to remain popular amongst teenage and young adult populations, despite several reports of vaping associated lung injury. This popularity is due in part to the vast variety of appealing flavours and nicotine concentrations easily accessible on the market. One of the first compounds that EC aerosols comes into contact within the lungs during a deep inhalation is pulmonary surfactant. This lipid protein mixture lines the alveoli, reducing surface tension and preventing alveolar collapse. Impairment of surfactants critical surface tension reducing activity can contribute to lung dysfunction. Currently, information on how EC aerosols impacts pulmonary surfactant remains limited. We hypothesized that exposure to EC aerosol impairs the surface tension reducing ability of surfactant. Bovine Lipid Extract Surfactant (BLES) was used as a model surfactant in a direct exposure syringe system. BLES (2ml) was placed in a syringe (30ml) attached to an EC. The generated aerosol was drawn into the syringe and then expelled, repeated 30 times. Biophysical analysis after exposure was completed using a constrained drop surfactometer (CDS). Minimum surface tensions increased after exposure to the EC aerosol. Variation in device used, addition of nicotine, or temperature of the aerosol had no additional effect. Two e-liquid flavours, menthol and red wedding, had further detrimental effects, resulting in higher surface tension than the vehicle exposed BLES. Alteration of surfactant properties through interaction with the produced aerosol was observed with a basic e-liquid vehicle, however additional compounds produced by added flavourings appeared to be able to increase inhibition. In conclusion, EC aerosols alter surfactant function through increases in minimum surface tension. This impairment may contribute to lung dysfunction and susceptibility to further injury.",

The production of the innermost intine layer, composed of cellulose, pectin and other polymers, is particularly poorly understood. Here we demonstrate an important and specific role for the hydroxyproline O-arabinosyltransferase (HPAT) FIN4 in tomato intine development. HPATs are plant-specific enzymes which initiate glycosylation of certain cell wall structural proteins and signaling peptides. FIN4 was expressed throughout pollen development in both the developing pollen and surrounding tapetal cells. A fin4 mutant with a partial deletion of the catalytic domain displayed significantly reduced male fertility in vivo and compromised pollen hydration and germination in vitro. However, fin4 pollen that successfully germinated formed morphologically normal pollen tubes with the same growth rate as the wild-type pollen. When we examined mature fin4 pollen, we found they were cytologically normal, and formed morphologically normal exine, but produced significantly thinner intine. During intine deposition at the late stages of pollen development we found fin4 pollen had altered polymer deposition, including reduced cellulose and increased detection of pectin, specifically homogalacturonan with both low and high degrees of methylesterification. Therefore, FIN4 plays an important role in intine formation and, in turn pollen hydration and germination and the process of intine formation involves dynamic changes in the developing pollen cell wall.",

Our simulations provide several suggestions complementing the experiments but also reveal major methodological difficulties in studies of such complex RNA-protein interfaces. Despite efforts to stabilize the binding via system-specific force-field adjustments, we have observed progressive distortions of the RNA-protein interface inconsistent with experimental data, as in detail documented. We further propose that the dynamics is so rich that its converged description would not be achievable even upon stabilizing the system. Still, after careful analysis of the trajectories, we have made several suggestions regarding the binding. We identify substates in the RNA loops which can explain the NOE data. The RGG tail localized in the minor groove remains disordered, sampling countless transient interactions with the RNA. There are long-range couplings among the different elements contributing to the recognition, which can lead to allosteric communication throughout the system. Overall, the RNA-FUS systems form dynamical ensembles that cannot be fully represented by single static structures. Thus, albeit imperfect, MD simulations represent a viable tool to investigate them.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWLife is based on energy conversion. In particular, in the nervous system significant amounts of energy are needed to maintain synaptic transmission and homeostasis. To a large extent, neurons depend on oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria to meet their high energy demand (Pekkurnaz and Wang, 2022). For a comprehensive understanding of the metabolic demands in neuronal signaling, accurate models of ATP production in mitochondria are required. Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent model of ATP production in mitochondria based on previous work (Pietrobon and Caplan, 1985; Magnus and Keizer, 1997; Metelkin et al., 2006; Garcia et al., 2019). The significant improvement of the model is that the reaction rate constants are set such that detailed balance is satisfied. Moreover, using thermodynamic considerations, the dependence of the reaction rate constants on membrane potential, pH, and substrate concentrations are explicitly provided. These constraints assure the model is physically plausible. Furthermore, we explore different parameter regimes to understand in which conditions ATP production or its export are the limiting steps in making ATP available in the cytosol. The outcomes reveal that, under the conditions used in our simulations, ATP production is the limiting step and not its export. Finally, we performed spatial simulations with nine 3D realistic mitochondrial reconstructions and linked the ATP production rate in the cytosol with morphological features of the organelles.\n\n1.

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic habitat destruction and climate change are altering the composition of plant communities worldwide1,2. However, traditional species distribution models cannot detect rapid, local plant species changes due to their low spatial and temporal resolution3,4, and remote sensing models can only identify changes in coarse vegetation categories5,6. Here we combine open-access remote sensing imagery, citizen science observations, and deep learning to create a multi-species prediction model at high spatial and temporal resolution. We train a novel deep convolutional neural network using [~]half a million observations within California to simultaneously predict the presence of over 2,000 plant species at meter-level resolution. This model--deepbiosphere--accurately performs many key biodiversity monitoring tasks, from fine-mapping geographic distributions of individual species and communities, to detecting rapid plant community changes in space and time. Deepbiosphere shifts the paradigm for species distribution modeling, providing a roadmap for inexpensive, automatic, and scalable detection of anthropogenic impacts on species worldwide.",
