    "abstract": "Midbrain dopamine neurons are essential for flexible control of adaptive behaviors. DA neurons that project to different target regions have unique biophysical properties, and it is thought that this diversity reflects functional specialization. This assumption implies the presence of specific genetic determinants with precise impacts on behavior. We tested this general hypothesis by homing in on one particular biophysical mechanism, Kv4 channel inactivation, using a combination of molecular, proteomic, electrophysiological, computational, and behavioral approaches. We demonstrate that KChIP4a, a singular Kv4 {beta}-subunit splice variant, prolongs hyperpolarization-rebound delays selectively in dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens core, shifts the integration of inhibitory inputs and, in turn, selectively regulates learning from negative prediction-errors. Our results reveal a highly specialized, gene-to-behavior mechanistic chain that is only operative in a particular dopaminergic subsystem, illuminating how molecularly defined biophysical switches are employed for neuron subtype-specific information processing in the brain.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/344499v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167984borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f8fbborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f5402aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@147bb3b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Oropouche virus (OROV; Genus: Orthobunyavirus) is the etiological agent of Oropouche fever, a debilitating febrile illness common in South America. We used recombinant expression of the OROV M polyprotein, that encodes the surface glycoproteins Gn and Gc plus the non-structural protein NSm, to probe the cellular determinants for OROV assembly and budding. Gn and Gc self-assemble and are secreted independently of NSm. Mature OROV Gn has two predicted transmembrane domains that are crucial for glycoprotein translocation to the Golgi complex and glycoprotein secretion and, unlike related orthobunyaviruses, both transmembrane domains are retained during Gn maturation. Disruption of Golgi function using the drugs brefeldin A and monensin inhibit glycoprotein secretion. Infection studies have previously shown that the cellular Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery is recruited to Golgi membranes during OROV assembly and that ESCRT activity is required for virus secretion. A dominant negative form of the ESCRT-associated ATPase VPS4 significantly reduces recombinant OROV glycoprotein secretion and blocks virus release from infected cells, and VPS4 partly co-localizes with OROV glycoproteins and membranes co-stained with Golgi markers. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation and fluorescence microscopy experiments demonstrate that OROV glycoproteins interact with the ESCRT-III component CHMP6, with overexpression of a dominant negative form of CHMP6 significantly reducing OROV glycoprotein secretion. Taken together, our data highlights differences in M polyprotein processing across orthobunyaviruses, that Golgi and ESCRT function are required for glycoprotein secretion, and identifies CHMP6 as an ESCRT-III component that interacts with OROV glycoproteins.\n\nImportanceOropouche virus causes Oropouche fever, a debilitating illness common in South America that is characterised by high fever, headache, myalgia and vomiting. The tripartite genome of this zoonotic virus is capable of reassortment and there have been multiple epidemics of Oropouche fever in South America over the last 50 years, making Oropouche virus infection a significant threat to public health. However, the molecular characteristics of this arbovirus are poorly understood. We developed a recombinant protein expression system to investigate the cellular determinants of OROV glycoprotein maturation and secretion. We show that the proteolytic processing of the M polypeptide, which encodes the surface glycoproteins (Gn and Gc) plus a non-structural protein (NSm), differs between OROV and its close relative Bunyamwera virus. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OROV M glycoprotein secretion requires the cellular ESCRT membrane-remodelling machinery and identify that the OROV glycoproteins interact with the ESCRT protein CHMP6.",

    "abstract": "Spiroplasma, which are known pathogens and commensals of arthropods and plants, are helical-shaped bacteria that lack a peptidoglycan layer. Spiroplasma swim by alternating between left- and right-handed helicity. Of note, this system is not related to flagellar motility, which is widespread in bacteria. A helical ribbon running along the inner side of the helical cell should be responsible for cell helicity and comprises the bacterial actin homolog, MreB, and a protein specific to Spiroplasma, fibril. Here, we isolated the ribbon and its major component, fibril filament, for electron microscopy (EM) analysis. Single-particle analysis of the fibril filaments using the negative-staining EM revealed a three-dimensional chain structure composed of rings with a size of 11 nm wide and 6 nm long, connected by a backbone cylinder with an 8.7 nm interval with a twist along the filament axis. This structure was verified through EM tomography of quick-freeze deep-etch replica sample, with a focus on its handedness. The handedness and pitch of the helix for the isolated ribbon and fibril filament agreed with those of the cell in the resting state. Structures corresponding to the alternative state were not identified. These results suggest that the helical cell structure is supported by fibril filaments; however, the helical switch is caused by the force generated by the MreB proteins. The isolation and structural outline of the fibril filaments provide crucial information for an in-depth clarification of the unique swimming mechanism of Spiroplasma.",

    "abstract": "Flow cytometry is commonly used to characterize nanoparticles (NPs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) but results are often expressed in arbitrary units to indicate fluorescence intensity. This hampers interlaboratory and inter-platform comparisons. We investigated the use of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorophores (MESF)-beads for assignment of fluorescence values to NPs and EVs by comparing two FITC-MESF bead sets as calibrators on different flow cytometry platforms (BD Influx, CytoFLEX LX and SORP BD FACSCelesta). Next, fluorescence signals of NPs and EVs were calibrated using different sets of FITC and PE-MESF beads. Fluorescence calibration using beads designed for cellular flow cytometry allowed inter-platform comparison. However, the intrinsic uncertainty in the fluorescence assignment to these MESF beads impacts the reliable assignment of MESF values to NPs and EVs based on extrapolation into the dim fluorescence range. Our findings demonstrate that the use of the same set of calibration materials (vendor and lot number) and the same number of calibration points, greatly improves robust interlaboratory and inter-platform comparison of fluorescent submicron sized particles.",

However, whereas the individual components of BR perception and signaling are well characterized experimentally, the question of how they can act and whether they are sufficient to carry out the critical function of cellular elongation remains open. Here, we combined computational modeling with quantitative cell physiology to understand the dynamics of the plasma membrane (PM)-localized BR response pathway during the initiation of cellular responses in the epidermis of the Arabidopsis root tip that are be linked to cell elongation. The model, consisting of ordinary differential equations, comprises the BR induced hyperpolarization of the PM, the acidification of the apoplast and subsequent cell wall swelling. We demonstrate that the competence of the root epidermal cells for the BR response predominantly depends on the amount and activity of H+-ATPases in the PM. The model further predicts that an influx of cations is required to compensate for the shift of positive charges caused by the apoplastic acidification. A potassium channel was subsequently identified and experimentally characterized, fulfilling this function. Thus, we established the landscape of components and parameters for physiological processes potentially linked to cell elongation, a central process in plant development.",

    "abstract": "The DNA damage response (DDR) is essential to maintain genome stability, and its deregulation predisposes to carcinogenesis while encompassing attractive targets for cancer therapy. Chromatin governs the DDR via the concerted interplay among different layers, including DNA, histone post-translational modifications (hPTMs), and chromatin-associated proteins. Here we employ multi-layered proteomics to characterize chromatin-mediated functional interactions of repair proteins, signatures of hPTMs, and the DNA-bound proteome during DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair at high temporal resolution. Our data illuminate the dynamics of known and novel DDR-associated factors both at chromatin and at DSBs. We functionally attribute novel chromatin-associated proteins to repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination (HR) and DSB repair pathway choice. We reveal histone reader ATAD2, microtubule organizer TPX2 and histone methyltransferase G9A as regulators of HR and PARP-inhibitor sensitivity. Furthermore, we distinguish hPTMs that are globally induced by DNA damage from those specifically acquired at sites flanking DSBs ({gamma}H2AX foci-specific), and profiled their dynamics during the DDR. Integration of complementary chromatin layers implicates G9A-mediated monomethylation of H3K56 at DSBs in HR. Our data provide a dynamic chromatin-centered view of the DDR that can be further mined to identify novel mechanistic links and cell vulnerabilities in DSB repair.",

Here we use simulations to test the statistical performances of the two approaches that are the most widely used in the field: Mantel tests and the Phylogenetic Bipartite Linear Model (PBLM). Mantel tests investigate the correlation between phylogenetic distances and dissimilarities in sets of interacting partners, while PBLM is a process-based approach that relies on strong assumptions about how interactions evolve. We find that PBLM often detects a phylogenetic signal when it should not. Simple Mantel tests instead have infrequent false positives and moderate statistical power; however, they often artifactually detect that closely related species interact with dissimilar partners. Partial Mantel tests, which are used to partial out the phylogenetic signal in the number of partners, actually fail at correcting for this confounding effect, and we instead recommend evaluating the significance of Mantel tests with network permutations constraining the number of partners. We also explore the ability of simple Mantel tests to analyze clade-specific phylogenetic signals. We provide general guidelines and an application on an interaction network between orchids and mycorrhizal fungi.",

Evaluating segmentation results is thus a necessary step for developing segmentation methods as well as for choosing the most appropriate method for a particular type of sample. The evaluation process has typically involved comparison of segmentations to those generated by humans, which can be expensive and subject to unknown bias. We present here an approach to evaluating cell segmentation methods without relying upon comparison to results from humans. For this, we defined a number of segmentation quality metrics that can be applied to multichannel fluorescence images. We calculated these metrics for 14 previously-described segmentation methods applied to datasets from 4 multiplexed microscope modalities covering 5 tissues. Using principal component analysis to combine the metrics we defined an overall cell segmentation quality score and ranked the segmentation methods. We found that two deep learning-based methods performed the best overall, but that results for all methods could be significantly improved by postprocessing to ensure proper matching of cell and nuclear masks. Our evaluation tool is available as open source and all code and data are available in a Reproducible Research Archive.",

    "abstract": "Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (PCa) mortality and is hypothesized to contribute to PCa aggressiveness and disparities in African American populations. The prostate epithelium was recently shown to express megalin, an endocytic receptor that internalizes globulin-bound hormones, which suggests regulation of prostate hormone levels, in contrast to the free hormone hypothesis. Here, we demonstrated that megalin imports testosterone bound to sex hormone-binding globulin into prostate cells. Prostatic loss of Lrp2 (megalin) in a mouse model resulted in reduced prostate testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. Megalin expression was regulated and suppressed by 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25D) in cell lines, patient-derived prostate epithelial cells, and prostate tissue explants, indicating a negative feedback loop. In patent samples, the relationships between hormones support this feedback mechanism, as prostatic DHT levels are higher in African American men and are inversely correlated with serum 25D status. Megalin levels are reduced in localized PCa by the Gleason grade and in patients with future disease recurrence. Our findings suggest that the free hormone hypothesis should be revisited for testosterone and highlight the impact of vitamin D deficiency on prostate androgen levels, which are known drivers of PCa. Thus, we revealed a mechanistic link between vitamin D and PCa disparities observed in African Americans.",

Here we show that the ccdA antitoxin component of the E.coli ccdAB toxin-antitoxin system is unusually sensitive to mutations when studied in the operonic context. A large fraction ([~]80%) of single-codon mutations, including many synonymous mutations in the ccdA gene shows inactive phenotype, but they retain native-like binding affinity towards cognate toxin, CcdB. Therefore, the observed phenotypic effects are largely not due to alterations in protein structure/stability, consistent with a large region of CcdA being intrinsically disordered. E. coli codon preference and strength of ribosome-binding associated with translation of downstream ccdB gene are found to be major contributors of the observed mutant phenotypes. In select cases, proteomics studies reveal altered ratios of CcdA:CcdB protein levels in vivo, suggesting that the ccdA mutations likely alter relative translation efficiencies of the two genes in the operon. We extend these results by studying single-site synonymous mutations that lead to loss of function phenotypes in the relBE operon upon introduction of rarer codons. Thus, in their operonic context, genes are likely to be more sensitive to both synonymous and non-synonymous point mutations than inferred previously.",

Constitutive Ins1tm1.1(cre)Thor (Ins1Cre) mice on the C57/bl6-J background has high {beta}-cell specificity and with no reported off-target effects. We explored if NOD:Ins1Cre mice could be used to investigate {beta}-cell gene deletion in type 1 diabetes disease modeling. We studied wildtype (Ins1WT/WT), Ins1 heterozygous (Ins1Cre/WT or Ins1Neo/WT), and Ins1 null (Ins1Cre/Neo) littermates on a NOD background. Female Ins1Neo/WT mice exhibited significant protection from diabetes, with further near-complete protection in Ins1Cre/WT mice. The effects of combined neomycin and Cre knock-in in Ins1Neo/Cre mice were not additive to the Cre knock-in alone. In Ins1Neo/Cre mice, protection from diabetes was associated with reduced insulitis at 12 weeks of age. Collectively, these data confirm previous reports that loss of Ins1 alleles protects NOD mice from diabetes development and demonstrates, for the first time, that Cre itself may have additional protective effects. This has significant implications for the experimental design and interpretation of pre-clinical type 1 diabetes studies using {beta}-cell-specific Cre in NOD mice.",

Here we focus on the task of storage and recall of structured knowledge in long-term memory. Specifically, we ask how recurrent neuronal networks can store and retrieve multiple knowledge structures. We model each structure as a set of binary relations between events and attributes (attributes may represent e.g., temporal order, spatial location, role in semantic structure), and map each structure to a distributed neuronal activity pattern using a vector symbolic architecture (VSA) scheme.\n\nWe then use associative memory plasticity rules to store the binarized patterns as fixed points in a recurrent network. By a combination of signal-to-noise analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our model allows for efficient storage of these knowledge structures, such that the memorized structures as well as their individual building blocks (e.g., events and attributes) can be subsequently retrieved from partial retrieving cues. We show that long-term memory of structured knowledge relies on a new principle of computation beyond the memory basins. Finally, we show that our model can be extended to store sequences of memories as single attractors.",

These sea squirts are highly divergent, yet hybridization has been reported by crossing experiments and genetic studies in the wild. Here, we examined the consequences of secondary contact between C. intestinalis and C. robusta in the English Channel. We produced genomes phased by transmission to infer the history of divergence and gene flow, and analyzed introgressed genomic tracts. Demographic inference revealed a history of secondary contact with a low overall rate of introgression. Introgressed tracts were short, segregating at low frequency, and scattered throughout the genome, suggesting traces of past contacts during the last 30 ky. However, we also uncovered a hotspot of introgression on chromosome 5, characterized by several hundred kb-long C. robusta haplotypes segregating in C. intestinalis, that introgressed during contemporary times the last 75 years. Although locally more frequent than the baseline level of introgression, C. robusta alleles are not fixed, even in the core region of the introgression hotspot. Still, linkage-disequilibrium patterns and haplotype-based tests suggest this genomic region is under recent positive selection. We further detected in the hotspot an over-representation of candidate SNPs lying on a cytochrome P450 gene with a high copy number of tandem repeats in the introgressed alleles. Cytochromes P450 are a superfamily of enzymes involved in detoxifying exogenous compounds, constituting a promising avenue for functional studies. These findings support that introgression of an adaptive allele is possible between very divergent genomes and that anthropogenic hybridization can provide the raw material for adaptation of native lineages in the Anthropocene.",

A range of non-canonical conjugated BAs is also identified, comprising unique BSH substrates that also inhibit C. difficile spore germination.

    "abstract": "Salmonella Enteritidis is the second most common serovar associated with invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease in sub-Saharan Africa. Previously, genomic and phylogenetic characterisation of S. Enteritidis isolates from human bloodstream led to the discovery of the Central/Eastern African (CEAC) and West African clades, which were distinct from the gastroenteritis-associated Global Epidemic clade (GEC). The African S. Enteritidis clades have unique genetic signatures that include genomic degradation, novel prophage repertoires and multi-drug resistance, but the molecular basis for the enhanced propensity of African S. Enteritidis to cause bloodstream infection is poorly understood. We used transposon insertion sequencing (TIS) to identify the genetic determinants of the GEC representative strain P125109 and the CEAC representative strain D7795 for growth in three in vitro conditions (LB or minimal NonSPI2 and InSPI2 growth media), and for survival and replication in RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. We identified 207 in vitro-required genes that were common to both S. Enteritidis strains and also required by S. Typhimurium, S. Typhi and Escherichia coli, and 63 genes that were only required by individual S. Enteritidis strains. Similar types of genes were required by both P125109 and D7795 for optimal growth in particular media. Screening the transposon libraries during macrophage infection identified 177 P125109 and 201 D7795 genes that contribute to bacterial survival and replication in mammalian cells. The majority of these genes have proven roles in Salmonella virulence. Our analysis also revealed candidate strain-specific macrophage fitness genes, some of which represent potential novel Salmonella virulence factors.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTInvasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) disease is a systemic infection that has a high case fatality rate of 15% and is responsible for an estimated 66,500 deaths/year in sub-Saharan Africa. The main causative agents are pathovariants of Salmonella Typhimurium, known as S. Typhimurium ST313, and Salmonella Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis), known as Central/Eastern African (CEAC) and West African S. Enteritidis. Whilst the African S. Typhimurium pathovariant has been an active focus of research over the past decade, studies on African S. Enteritidis have been lacking. We used transposon insertion sequencing (TIS) to identify the genetic requirements of both African and Global Epidemic S. Enteritidis to grow in vitro and to infect murine macrophages. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide functional analysis of African S. Enteritidis under conditions relevant to infection of a mammalian host. We show that the gene sets required for growth under laboratory conditions and macrophage infection by African and Global Epidemic S. Enteritidis were broadly similar, and that the majority of the genes that contribute to survival and replication in macrophage already have proven roles in Salmonella virulence. Our analysis did identify candidate strain-specific macrophage fitness genes, some of which could be novel Salmonella virulence factors.",

    "abstract": "RECIST is grounded on the assumption that target lesion selection is objective and representative of the change in total tumor burden during therapy. A computer simulation model was designed to challenge this assumption, focusing on a particular aspect of subjectivity: target lesion selection. Disagreement among readers, and between readers and total tumor burden was analyzed, as a function of the total number of lesions, affected organs, and lesion growth. Disagreement aggravates when the number of lesions increases, when lesions are concentrated on few organs, and when lesion growth borders the thresholds of progressive disease and partial response. An intrinsic methodological error is observed in the estimation of total tumor burden (TTB) via RECIST. In a metastatic setting, RECIST displays a non-linear, unpredictable behavior. Our results demonstrate that RECIST can deliver an accurate estimate of total tumor burden in localized disease, but fails in cases of distal metastases and multiple organ involvement. This is worsened by the \"selection of the largest lesions\", which introduce a bias that makes it hardly possible to perform an accurate estimate of the total tumor burden. Including more (if not all) lesions in the quantitative analysis of tumor burden is desirable.",

    "abstract": "The oncogene cMYC (HGNC:7553) is a critical genomic target of the BRD4-NUT (B4N) protein that defines many of the NUTM1-rearrangement cancer subtypes in NUT carcinoma (NC). Previously, we reported that B4N interacts with the EP300 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT3B) and creates hyperacetylated \"megadomains\" that activate downstream genes such as cMYC. Here we ask how misregulated cMYC in turn interacts with protein partners and target genes in patient-derived NC797 cells, and whether these interactions change in response to B4N inactivation. We used CRISPR-Cas9 mediated knock-in of a BioTAP affinity tag to analyze cMYC protein expressed from its normal chromosomal context. This allowed us to implement a crosslinking purification method termed BioTAP-XL to preserve cMYC integrity and chromatin association for genomic and mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses. We found that in the NC797 cell line, cMYC interacts primarily with the NuA4 KAT5 lysine acetyltransferase complex, with interactions that are maintained despite a decrease in cMYC levels after JQ1 treatment. We propose that a cascade of aberrant acetyltransferase activities in NC797 cells, first via EP300 recruitment by B4N to mis-regulate cMYC, and then by KAT5 interaction with the resulting overexpressed cMYC protein, drive NC cell proliferation and blockade to differentiation.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=134 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/489219v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (23K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@82ec09org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1566d31org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11ab4dborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57b741_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Simple SummaryA longstanding goal in biology is to understand how protein interactions influence and reflect cellular disease states. MYC is a critical regulator of cellular proliferation that is mis-regulated in many cancers, including those with NUTM1-rearrangements featured in this issue. NUT carcinoma cells are dependent on MYC expression, which blocks differentiation. Using a crosslinking approach to identify MYC protein interactions in a NUTM1-rearranged patient cell line, we found that MYC interacts primarily with subunits of the NuA4 lysine acetyltransferase (KAT5), one of two KAT complexes previously discovered as MYC interactors in non-NUTM1 cell lines.",

While tankyrases are present in most animals, functional differences across species exist. In this work we confirm the widespread distribution of tankyrases throughout the branches of multicellular animal life and identified the single-celled choanoflagellates as earliest origin of tankyrases. We further show that sequence and structural aspects of TNKSs are well conserved even between highly diverged species. We also experimentally characterized an anciently diverged tankyrase homolog from the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica and show that the basic functional aspects, such as poly-ADP-ribosylation activity and interaction with the canonical tankyrase binding peptide motif, are conserved. Conversely, the presence of tankyrase binding motifs in orthologs of confirmed interaction partners vary greatly between species, indicating that tankyrases have different sets of interaction partners depending on the animal lineage. Overall, our analysis suggests a remarkable degree of conservation for tankyrases, although their regulatory functions in cells have likely changed considerably throughout evolution.",

    "abstract": "Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are chromosomally encoded mobile genetic elements that can transfer DNA between bacterial strains. Recently, as part of efforts to determine hypothetical gene functions, we have discovered an important regulatory module encoded on an ICE known as TnSmu1 on the Streptococcus mutans chromosome. The regulatory module consists of a cI-like repressor with a helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain immRSmu (immunity repressor) and a metalloprotease immASmu (anti-repressor). It is not possible to create an in-frame deletion mutant of immRSmu and repression of immRSmu with CRISPRi causes substantial cell defects. We used a bypass of essentiality (BoE) screen to discover genes that allow deletion of the regulatory module. This revealed that conjugation genes, located within TnSmu1, can restore the viability of an immRSmu mutant. Deletion of immRSmu also leads to production of a circular intermediate form of TnSmu1, that is also inducible by the genotoxic agent mitomycin C. To gain further insights into potential regulation of TnSmu1 by ImmRSmu and broader effects on S. mutans UA159 physiology we used CRISPRi and RNA-seq. Strongly induced genes included all the TnSmu1 mobile element, genes involved in amino acid metabolism, transport systems, and a Type I-C CRISPR-Cas system. Lastly, bioinformatic analysis shows that the TnSmu1 mobile element and its associated genes are well distributed across S. mutans isolates. Taken together, our results show that activation of TnSmu1 is controlled by the immRASmu module, and that activation is deleterious to S. mutans, highlighting the complex interplay between mobile elements and their host.",

To identify molecular and cellular mechanisms while retaining the appropriate genetic background, we generated induced excitatory glutamatergic neurons (iN) from iPSCs derived from four AUD-diagnosed subjects with KCNJ6 variants ( Affected: AF) and four control subjects without variants ( Unaffected: UN). Neurons were analyzed for changes in gene expression, morphology, excitability and physiological properties. Single cell RNA sequencing suggests that KCNJ6 AF variant neurons have altered patterns of synaptic transmission and cell projection morphogenesis. Results confirm that AF neurons express lower levels of GIRK2, have greater neurite area, and elevated excitability. Interestingly, exposure to intoxicating concentrations of ethanol induces GIRK2 expression and reverses functional effects in AF neurons. Ectopic overexpression of GIRK2 alone mimics the effect of ethanol to normalize induced excitability. We conclude that KCNJ6 variants decrease GIRK2 expression and increase excitability and that this effect can be minimized or reduced with ethanol.",

Functional studies of the histone demethylase KDM1a/LSD1 converge to indicate that this epigenetic regulator is a key regulator of cell fate 1, although the extracellular cues controlling LSD1 action remain largely unknown. Here we show that {beta}-Catenin is a substrate of LSD1. Demethylation by LSD1 prevents {beta}-Catenin degradation thereby increasing its nuclear levels. In muscle stem cells, {beta}-Catenin and LSD1 are both recruited on the MyoD Core Enhancer to control MyoD expression and promote muscle stem cell commitment 2,3. Moreover, a {beta}-Catenin reporter construct shows that the involvement of LSD1 in {beta}-Catenin regulation is not restricted to MyoD activation.

    "abstract": "Summary/AbstractOdorant binding proteins, OBPs, are a diverse family of small, globular, extra-cellular proteins solubilize volatile organic compounds (VOCs) so they can be internalized and transported by an organism. Since their initial discovery in the early eighties 1, thousands of OBPs have been identified through genome sequencing and characterized by fluorescence ligand binding assays 2. While individual OBPs have been studied in the context of their roles in specific organism, there have been no studies towards the understanding of the comparative structure-function relations of all known OBPs, primarily due to a lack of a centralized database that incorporates the binding affinity with the structure of all OBPs. Incorporating OBP information into a database requires not only an extensive search of all existing resources, but also creating a useful platform that relates sequence structures to target functions. Combining 215 functional studies containing 381 unique OBPs from 91 insect species we created a database, iOBPdb: https://iobpdb.herokuapp.com, of OBP binding affinities for a wide range of VOC targets. We demonstrate here that the construction of this initial database provides powerful search and associative capabilities including interrogating odor binding proteins as clusters and groups by sequence similarity versus protein and target molecular weights, and by the functional groups of the VOC targets. The comparative interrogation of the probe-target recognition allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying structural features of all OBPs that had not been possible by only examining the OBPs individually. We present our results in a variety of phylogenetic representations as well as providing the binding profiles of OBP groups to VOC functional moieties. Potential applications include development of molecular probes for biosensors, novel bioassays and drugs, discovery of novel pesticides which inhibit VOC / OBP interactions, as well providing a foundational basis for the functional understanding of odor sensing and perception in the brain.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=158 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/498339v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9c2fa0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fad38aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@56175forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@189797_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Modulation of export of photoassimilates from the chloroplast is essential for controlling the distribution of fixed carbon in the cell and maintaining optimum photosynthetic rates. In this study we identified chloroplast triose phosphate/phosphate translocators 2 and 3 (CreTPT2 and CreTPT3) in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that exhibited similar substrate specificities but were differentially expressed over the diel cycle. We focused mostly on analyzing CreTPT3 because of its high level of expression and the severe phenotype exhibited by tpt3 relative to the tpt2 mutants. Null mutants for CreTPT3 had a pleiotropic phenotype that impacted growth, photosynthetic activities, metabolite profiles, carbon partitioning, and organelle-specific accumulation of H2O2. These analyses demonstrated that CreTPT3 is a dominant conduit on the chloroplast envelope for the transport of photoassimilate. In addition, CreTPT3 can serve as a safety valve that moves excess reductant out of the chloroplast and appears to be essential for preventing the cells from experiencing oxidative stress and accumulating of reactive oxygen species, even under low/moderate light intensities. Finally, our studies indicate subfunctionalization of the CreTPT transporters and suggest that there are differences in managing the export of photoassimilates from the chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas and vascular plants.",

    "abstract": "The correct evaluation of ligand binding free energies by computational methods is still a very challenging active area of research. The most employed methods for these calculations can be roughly classified into four groups: (i) the fastest and less accurate methods, such as molecular docking, designed to sample a large number of molecules and rapidly rank them according to the potential binding energy; (ii) the second class of methods use a thermodynamic ensemble, typically generated by molecular dynamics, to analyze the endpoints of the thermodynamic cycle for binding and extract differences, in the so-called  end-point methods; (iii) the third class of methods is based on the Zwanzig relationship and computes the free energy difference after a chemical change of the system (alchemical methods); and (iv) methods based on biased simulations, such as metadynamics, for example. These methods require increased computational power and as expected, result in increased accuracy for the determination of the strength of binding. Here, we describe an intermediate approach, based on the Monte Carlo Recursion (MCR) method first developed by Harold Scheraga. In this method, the system is sampled at increasing effective temperatures, and the free energy of the system is assessed from a series of terms W(b, T), computed from Monte Carlo (MC) averages at each iteration. We show the application of the MCR for ligand binding with datasets of guest-hosts systems (N=75) and we observed that a good correlation is obtained between experimental data and the binding energies computed with MCR. We also compared the experimental data with an end-point calculation from equilibrium Monte Carlo calculations that allowed us to conclude that the lower-energy (lower-temperature) terms in the calculation are the most relevant to the estimation of the binding energies, resulting in similar correlations between MCR and MC data and the experimental values. On the other hand, the MCR method provides a reasonable view of the binding energy funnel, with possible connections with the ligand binding kinetics, as well. The codes developed for this analysis are publicly available on GitHub as a part of the LiBELa/MCLiBELa project (https://github.com/alessandronascimento/LiBELa).",

However, protein-based VLPs are limited in their ability to control valency on fixed scaffold geometries and are thymus-dependent antigens that elicit neutralizing B cell memory themselves, which can distract immune responses. Here, we investigated DNA origami as an alternative material for multivalent antigen display in vivo, applied to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 that is the primary antigenic target of neutralizing antibody responses. Icosahedral DNA-VLPs elicited neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in a valency-dependent manner following sequential immunization in mice, quantified by pseudo-and live-virus neutralization assays. Further, induction of B cell memory against the RBD required T cell help, but the immune sera did not contain boosted, class-switched antibodies against the DNA scaffold. This contrasted with protein-based VLP display of the RBD that elicited B cell memory against both the target antigen and the scaffold. Thus, DNA-based VLPs enhance target antigen immunogenicity without generating off-target, scaffold-directed immune memory, thereby offering a potentially important alternative material for particulate vaccine design.",

However, the intra-individual stability of PBL methylation in IBD has not been characterised. Here, we studied the long-term stability of all probes located on the Illumina HumanMethylation EPIC BeadChip array.\n\nMethodsWe followed a cohort of 46 adult IBD patients (36 Crohns disease (CD), 10 ulcerative colitis (UC), median age 44 (IQR: 27-56), 50% female) that received standard care without any intervention at the Amsterdam UMC. Paired PBL samples were collected at two time points with a median 7 (range: 2-9) years in between. Differential methylation and intra-class correlation (ICC) analyses were used to identify time-associated differences and temporally stable CpGs, respectively.\n\nResultsAround 60% of all EPIC array loci presented poor intra-individual stability (ICC <0.50); 78.114 ({approx}9%) showed good (ICC 0.75 - 0.89); and 41.274 ({approx}5%) excellent (ICC [&ge;]0.90) stability. Focusing on previously identified consistently differentially methylated positions indicated that 22 CD-, 11 UC-, and 24 IBD-associated loci demonstrated high stability (ICC [&ge;]0.75) over time; of these, we observed a marked stability of CpG loci associated to the HLA genes.\n\nConclusionOur data provide insight into the long-term stability of the PBL DNA methylome within an IBD context, facilitating the selection of biologically relevant and robust IBD-associated epigenetic biomarkers with increased potential for independent validation.

    "abstract": "1.Wnt and Hh are known signalling pathways involved in neural differentiation and recent work has shown the cell cycle regulator, Never in Mitosis Kinase 2 (Nek2) is able to regulate both pathways. Despite its known function in pathway regulation, few studies have explored Nek2 within embryonic development. The P19 embryonal carcinoma cell model was used to investigate Nek2 and neural differentiation through CRISPR knockout and overexpression studies. Loss of Nek2 reduced cell proliferation in the undifferentiated state and during directed differentiation, while overexpression increased cell proliferation. Despite these changes in proliferation rates, Nek2 deficient cells maintained pluripotency markers after neural induction while Nek2 overexpressing cells lost these markers in the undifferentiated state. Nek2 deficient cells lost the ability to differentiate into both neurons and astrocytes, although Nek2 overexpressing cells enhanced neuron differentiation at the expense of astrocytes. Hh and Wnt signaling were explored, however there was no clear connection between Nek2 and these pathways causing the observed changes to differentiation phenotypes. Mass spectrometry was also used during wildtype and Nek2 knockout cell differentiation and we identified reduced electron transport chain components in the knockout population. Immunoblotting confirmed the loss of these components and additional studies showed cells lacking Nek2 were exclusively glycolytic. Interestingly, hypoxia inducible factor 1 was stabilized in these Nek2 knockout cells despite culturing them under normoxic conditions. Since neural differentiation requires a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, we propose a mechanism where Nek2 prevents HIF1 stabilization, thereby allowing cells to use oxidative phosphorylation to facilitate neuron and astrocyte differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Many animals exhibit contrast between their dorsal and ventral coloration. If selection acts differently on dorsal versus ventral coloration, these body parts should evolve as independent modules of trait evolution, irrespective of ancestral covariance. Here, we compare the evolution of feather color across 11 body regions for a clade of Australasian songbirds (Meliphagoidea). We find evidence for three modules of covarying color regions: dorsal, ventral, and flight feathers. Among these modules, ventral feathers had color that was highly labile, evolving at 3 times the rate for dorsal plumage and 20 times the rate for flight feathers. While both dorsal and ventral plumage tend to be correlated with precipitation or the degree of vegetation, we find that dorsal plumage is twice as similar to colors of background substrates in satellite photos. This finding, which a direct effect of climate in Glogers rule does not predict, adds support for background matching as an explanation for geographic gradients in animal color. Furthermore, it suggests that selection for background matching has had a greater effect on dorsal plumage than ventral plumage color. Overall, differential selection on ventral and dorsal colors likely maintains these as distinct modules over evolutionary time scales - a novel explanation for dorsoventral contrast in pigmentation.",

    "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a commonly observed psychiatric disorder that affects more than 2% of the world population with a rising trend. However, disease-associated pathways and biomarkers are yet to be fully comprehended. In this study, we analyzed previously generated RNA-seq data across seven different brain regions from three distinct studies to identify differentially and co-expressed genes for patients with MDD. Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis revealed that NPAS4 is the only gene downregulated in three different brain regions. Furthermore, co-expressing gene modules responsible for glutamatergic signaling are negatively enriched in these regions. We used the results of both DGE and co-expression analyses to construct a novel MDD-associated pathway. In our model, we propose that disruption in glutamatergic signaling-related pathways might be associated with the downregulation of NPAS4 and many other immediate-early genes (IEGs) that control synaptic plasticity. In addition to DGE analysis, we identified the relative importance of KEGG pathways in discriminating MDD phenotype using a machine learning-based approach. We anticipate that our study will open doors to developing better therapeutic approaches targeting glutamatergic receptors in the treatment of MDD.",

    "abstract": "Memory is critical for many cognitive functions, from remembering facts, to learning complex environmental rules. While memory encoding occurs during wake, memory consolidation is associated with sleep-related neural activity. Further, research suggests that individual differences in alpha frequency during wake (~ 7 to 13 Hz) modulate memory processes, with higher individual alpha frequency (IAF) associated with greater memory performance. However, the relationship between wake-related EEG individual differences, such as IAF, and sleep-related neural correlates of memory consolidation has been largely unexplored, particularly in a complex rule-based memory context. Here, we aimed to investigate whether wake-derived IAF and sleep neurophysiology interact to influence rule learning in a sample of 35 healthy adults (16 males; mean age = 25.4, range: 18 to 40). Participants learned rules of a modified miniature language prior to either 8hrs of sleep or wake, after which they were tested on their knowledge of the rules in a grammaticality judgement task. Results indicate that sleep neurophysiology and wake-derived IAF do not interact but modulate memory for complex linguistic rules separately. Phase-amplitude coupling between slow oscillations and spindles during non-rapid eye-movement (NREM) sleep also promoted memory for rules that were analogous to the canonical English word order. As an exploratory analysis, we found that rapid eye-movement (REM) sleep theta power at posterior regions interacts with IAF to predict rule learning and proportion of time in REM sleep predicts rule learning differentially depending on grammatical rule type. Taken together, the current study provides behavioural and electrophysiological evidence for a complex role of NREM and REM sleep neurophysiology and wake-derived IAF in the consolidation of rule-based information.",

We asked whether training on a task while being simultaneously exposed to visual features from a different task tested at baseline and post-training might influence performance on the baseline task.\n\nMethodsIn Experiment one, subjects performed an orientation discrimination (OD) task using a pair of gratings presented at individuals psychophysical threshold. We then trained participants over multiple sessions on a temporal order judgment task (TOJ), using the exact same gratings but presented with different time offsets. On the last session we re-tested OD. We coupled training with transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) over the parietal cortex, the human middle temporal area or sham, in three separate groups. In Experiment two, subjects performed the same OD task at baseline and post-training, while tRNS was delivered at rest during training.\n\nResultsResults showed that tRNS over parietal cortex facilitated learning of the trained task. Moreover, we found a detrimental effect on OD when subjects received parietal tRNS coupled with training, but a benefit on OD when subjects received stimulation while at rest.\n\nConclusionsThese results clearly indicate that task-irrelevant information is actively suppressed during learning, and that this prioritization mechanism of selection likely resides in the parietal cortex.",

    "abstract": "During development, the hypothalamus emerges from the ventral diencephalon of the neural tube and is regionalised into several distinct functional domains. Each domain is characterised by different combinations of transcription factors, the expression of which is regulated by signalling molecules and downstream transcriptional networks. Transcription factors, including Nkx2.1, Nkx2.2, Pax6 and Rx, are expressed in the presumptive hypothalamus and its surrounding regions from an early developmental stage and play critical roles in the development of these areas. However, the regulation of transcription factor expression and the details of the transcriptional network among them have not been fully elucidated.\n\nAs early hypothalamus development takes place in the ventral region of the forebrain where Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) is expressed, we focused on the relationship between Shh and its downstream transcription factors and investigated the transcriptional regulation along the dorsal-ventral axis. Using a reporter mouse line, in vitro neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells and gene overexpression in chick embryos, we found that Pax6, Nkx2.1 and Nkx2.2 are regulated epistatically by different Shh signal intensities. Nkx2.1 and Nkx2.2 mutually repress each other; however, they induce each other in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Moreover, Rx resides upstream of all these transcription factors and determines the location of the hypothalamic region along the dorsal-ventral and anterior-posterior regulations. Finally, we found that the Shh signal demarcates the diencephalic region from the retinal area. Our findings suggest that Shh signalling, and its downstream transcription network, are required for hypothalamic regionalisation and establishment of diencephalic cell fate.",

Although previous studies have constructed fitness landscapes based on comprehensively studying the mutations in specific genes, the high dimensionality of genotypic changes prevents us from developing a fitness landscape capable of predicting evolution for the whole cell. Herein, we address this problem by inferring the fitness landscape for antibiotic resistance evolution by quantifying the phenotypic changes, that is, multi-dimensional time-series measurements of the drug resistance profile. Using the time-series data of drug resistance for multiple drugs, we inferred that the fitness landscape underlies the evolution dynamics of resistance. We showed that different peaks of the landscape correspond to different drug resistance mechanisms, thus supporting the validity of the inferred fitness landscape. We further discuss how inferred phenotype-fitness landscapes could contribute to the prediction and control of evolution. This approach bridges the gap between phenotypic/genotypic changes and fitness while contributing to a better understanding of drug resistance evolution.",

    "abstract": "To reorient gaze (the eye in space) towards a target can be achieved by infinitely many combinations of eye- and head movements. However, behavioral measurements show that the primate gaze-control system selects specific contributions of eye- and head to the saccade, which depend on the initial eye-in-head orientation. Single-unit recordings in the primate superior colliculus (SC) during head-unrestrained gaze shifts have further suggested that cells may encode the instantaneous trajectory of a desired straight gaze path in a feedforward way by the total cumulative number of spikes in the neural population, and that the instantaneous gaze kinematics are determined by the neural firing rates. The recordings also indicated that the latter depended strongly on the initial eye position as well. We recently proposed a conceptual model that accounts for many of the observed properties of eye-head gaze shifts and on the potential role of the SC. Here, we extend and test the model by incorporating a spiking neural network of the SC motor map, the output of which drives the eye-head motor control circuitry by linear cumulative summation of individual spike effects of each recruited SC neuron. We propose a simple neural mechanism on SC cells that explains the modulatory influence of feedback from an initial eye-in-head position signal on their spiking activity. The same signal also determines the onset delay of the head movement with respect to the eye. The downstream eye- and head burst generators were taken to be linear, as our earlier work had suggested that much of the nonlinear kinematics of saccadic eye movements may be due to neural encoding at the collicular level, rather than at the brainstem. We show that the spiking activity of the SC population drives gaze to the intended target location within a dynamic local gaze-velocity feedback circuit that yields realistic eye- and head-movement kinematics and dynamic SC gaze-movement fields.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is increasing worldwide. Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) have immunomodulatory functions and are a promising source for cell transplantation therapy for IBD. However, owing to their heterogeneous nature, their therapeutic efficacy in colitis is controversial and depends on the delivery route and form of transplanted cells. Cluster of differentiation (CD)73 is widely expressed in MSCs and used to obtain a homogeneous MSC population. Herein, we determined the optimal method for MSC transplantation using CD73+ cells in a colitis model. mRNA sequencing analysis showed that CD73+ cells exhibit downregulation of inflammatory genes and upregulation of extracellular matrix-related genes. Furthermore, three-dimensional CD73+ cell spheroids showed enhanced engraftment at the injured site through the enteral route, facilitated extracellular matrix remodeling, and downregulated inflammatory gene expression in fibroblasts, leading to attenuation of colonic atrophy. Therefore, the interaction between intestinal fibroblasts and exogenous MSCs via tissue remodeling is one mechanism that can be exploited for colitis prevention. Our results highlight that transplantation of homogeneous cell populations with well-characterized properties is beneficial for IBD treatment.",

    "abstract": "Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are essential for eukaryotic cells to integrate and respond to a wide array of stimuli. Maintaining specificity in signaling through MAPK networks is key to coupling specific inputs to appropriate cellular responses. One way that MAPKs achieve specificity is through transient interactions with docking sites: short linear motifs found in MAPK substrates, regulators, and scaffolds. Docking sites bind to a conserved groove located in the catalytic domain of all MAPKs including the ERK and p38 subfamilies, but how specificity is achieved remains unresolved. To understand the basis of docking selectivity for these two subfamilies, we screened a library of thousands of human proteome-derived sequences for docking to ERK2 and p38. We discovered a large number of sequences that bound specifically to only one MAPK or promiscuously to both, and that selective and non-selective interactors conformed to distinct sequence motifs. In particular, selective binding to p38 correlated with higher net charge in the docking site, and this phenomenon was driven by enrichment for Lys residues. A pair of acidic residues unique to the docking groove of p38 mediated selectivity for Lys-rich basic motifs. Finally, we validated a set of full-length proteins harboring docking sites selected as hits in our screens to be authentic MAPK interactors and identified ChREBP and TACC1 as cellular MAPK substrates. This study identifies distinguishing features that help define MAPK signaling networks and explains how specific docking motifs promote signaling integrity.",

    "abstract": "Alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells harbor the facultative progenitor capacity in the lung alveolus to drive regeneration after lung injury. Using single cell transcriptomics, software-guided segmentation of tissue damage, and in vivo lineage tracing, we have identified the grainyhead transcription factor Tfcp2l1 as a key regulator of this regenerative process. Tfcp2l1 expression is initiated late in lung development and restricted to the AT2 cell population in the postnatal lung. Loss of Tfcp2l1 in adult AT2 cells decreased self-renewal and enhanced AT2-AT1 differentiation during active tissue regeneration. Conversely, Tfcp2l1 blunts the proliferative response to inflammatory signaling during the early acute phase after injury. This ability of Tfcp2l1 to temporally regulate the balance of AT2 self-renewal and differentiation is spatially restricted to zones undergoing active alveolar regeneration. Single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracing reveal that Tfcp2l1 regulates cell fate dynamics by balancing the traffic across the AT2-AT1 differentiation axis and restricting the inflammatory program in AT2 cells. Organoid modeling shows that these cell fate dynamics are controlled by Tfcp2l1 regulation of IL-1 receptor expression and activity in AT2 cells. Together, these studies reveal the critical importance of properly staging lung alveolar regeneration and the integral role of Tfcp2l1 plays in balancing epithelial cell self-renewal and differentiation in this process.",

    "abstract": "The activation of Src kinase in cells is strictly controlled by intramolecular inhibitory interactions mediated by SH3 and SH2 domains. They impose structural constraints on the kinase domain holding it in a catalytically non-permissive state. The transition between inactive and active conformation is known to be largely regulated by the phosphorylation state of key tyrosines 416 and 527. Here we identified that phosphorylation of tyrosine 90 reduces binding affinity of the SH3 domain to its interacting partners, opens the Src structure, and renders Src catalytically active. This is accompanied by an increased affinity to the plasma membrane, decreased membrane motility and slower diffusion from focal adhesions. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 90 controlling SH3-medited intramolecular inhibitory interaction, analogical to tyrosine 527 regulating SH2-C-terminus bond, enables SH3 and SH2 domains to serve as cooperative but independent regulatory elements. This mechanism allows Src to adopt several distinct conformations of varying catalytic activities and interacting properties, enabling it to operate not as a simple switch but as a tunable regulator functioning as a signaling hub in a variety of cellular processes.",

We tested this theory with three independent assays using an Acinetobacter baylyi model system that exclusively selects for cat gene amplification mutants. Our results demonstrate all cat gene amplification mutant colonies arise through a multistep process. While the late steps occur during selection exposure, these mutants derive from low-level amplification mutant cells that form before growth-inhibiting selection is imposed. During selection, these partial mutants undergo multiple secondary steps generating higher amplification over several days to multiple weeks to eventually form visible high-copy amplification colonies. Based on these findings, amplification in this Acinetobacter system can be explained by a natural selection process that does not require a stress response. These findings have fundamental implications to understanding the role of growth-limiting selective environments on cancer development.",

The gene coverage and metabolic information of the orthology-based draft model were expanded via Drosophila-specific KEGG and MetaCyc databases, with several curation steps to avoid metabolic redundancy and stoichiometric inconsistency. Further, we performed literature-based curations to improve gene-reaction associations, subcellular metabolite locations, and updated various metabolic pathways including cholesterol metabolism. The performance of the resulting Drosophila model, termed iDrosophila1 (8,230 reactions, 6,990 metabolites, and 2,388 genes), was assessed using flux balance analysis in comparison with the other currently available fly models leading to superior or comparable results. We also evaluated transcriptome-based prediction capacity of the iDrosophila1, where differential metabolic pathways during Parkinsons disease could be successfully elucidated. Overall, iDrosophila1 is promising to investigate systems-level metabolic alterations in response to genetic and environmental perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Immunocompromised populations are highly vulnerable to developing life-threatening infections. Strategies to protect patients with weak immune responses are urgently needed. Employing trained immunity, whereby innate leukocytes undergo reprogramming upon exposure to a microbial product and respond more robustly to subsequent infection, is a promising approach. Previously, we demonstrated that the TLR4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) induces trained immunity and confers broad resistance to infection. TLR4 signals through both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent cascades, but the relative contribution of each pathway to induction of trained immunity is unknown. Here, we show that MPLA-induced resistance to Staphylococcus aureus infection is lost in MyD88-KO, but not TRIF-KO, mice. The MyD88-activating agonist CpG (TLR9 agonist), but not TRIF-activating Poly I:C (TLR3 agonist), protects against infection in a macrophage-dependent manner. MPLA- and CpG-induced augmentation of macrophage metabolism and antimicrobial functions is blunted in MyD88-, but not TRIF-KO, macrophages. Augmentation of antimicrobial functions occurs in parallel to metabolic reprogramming and is dependent, in part, on mTOR activation. Splenic macrophages from CpG-treated mice confirmed that TLR/MyD88-induced reprogramming occurs in vivo. TLR/MyD88-triggered metabolic and functional reprogramming was reproduced in human monocyte-derived macrophages. These data show that MyD88-dependent signaling is critical in TLR-mediated trained immunity.",

Autophagy-related (ATG) proteins and autophagy receptors are a set of host factors that participate in autophagy, but have also shown to function in other unrelated cellular pathways. Although autophagy is reported to both inhibit and enhance CHIKV replication, the specific role of individual ATG proteins remains largely unknown. Here, a siRNA screen was performed to evaluate the importance of the ATG proteome and autophagy receptors in controlling CHIKV infection. We observed that 7 out of 50 ATG proteins impact the replication of CHIKV. Among those, depletion of the mitochondrial protein and autophagy receptor BCL2 Interacting Protein 3 (BNIP3) increased CHIKV infection. Interestingly, BNIP3 controls CHIKV independently of autophagy and cell death. Detailed analysis of the CHIKV viral cycle revealed that BNIP3 interferes with the early stages of infection. Moreover, the antiviral role of BNIP3 was found conserved across two distinct CHIKV genotypes and the closely related Semliki Forest virus. Altogether, this study describes a novel and previously unknown function of the mitochondrial protein BNIP3 in the control of the early stages of the alphavirus viral cycle.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial AAA+ unfoldases are crucial for bacterial physiology by recognizing specific substrates and, typically, unfolding them for degradation by a proteolytic component. The caseinolytic protease (Clp) system is one example where a hexameric unfoldase (e.g., ClpC) interacts with the tetradecameric proteolytic core ClpP. Unfoldases can have both ClpP-dependent and ClpP-independent roles in protein homeostasis, development, virulence, and cell differentiation. ClpC is an unfoldase predominantly found in Gram-positive bacteria and mycobacteria. Intriguingly, the obligate intracellular Gram-negative pathogen Chlamydia, an organism with a highly reduced genome, also encodes a ClpC ortholog, implying an important function for ClpC in chlamydial physiology. Here, we used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to gain insight into the function of chlamydial ClpC. ClpC exhibits intrinsic ATPase and chaperone activities, with a primary role for the Walker B motif in the first nucleotide binding domain (NBD1). Furthermore, ClpC binds ClpP1P2 complexes via ClpP2 to form the functional protease ClpCP2P1 in vitro, which degraded arginine-phosphorylated {beta}-casein. In vivo experiments confirmed that higher order complexes of ClpC are present in chlamydial cells. Importantly, the in vivo data further revealed severe negative effects of both overexpression and depletion of ClpC in Chlamydia as revealed by a significant reduction in chlamydial growth. Here again, NBD1 was critical for ClpC function. Hence, we provide the first mechanistic insight into the molecular and cellular function of chlamydial ClpC, which supports its essentiality in Chlamydia. ClpC is, therefore, a potential novel target for the development of anti-chlamydial agents.\n\nSignificanceChlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular pathogen and the worlds leading cause of preventable infectious blindness and bacterial sexually transmitted infections. Due to the high prevalence of chlamydial infections along with negative effects of current broad-spectrum treatment strategies, new anti-chlamydial agents with novel targets are desperately needed. In this context, bacterial Clp proteases have emerged as promising new antibiotic targets, since they often play central roles in bacterial physiology and, for some bacterial species, are even essential for survival. Here, we report on the chlamydial AAA+ unfoldase ClpC, its functional reconstitution and characterization, individually and as part of the ClpCP2P1 protease, and establish an essential role for ClpC in chlamydial growth and intracellular development, thereby identifying ClpC as a potential target for anti-chlamydial compounds.",

Long-read sequencing was used to reconstruct complete plasmid sequences from 49 isolates obtained from the daily stool samples of 23 travellers over a three-week period. This method revealed a collection of 105 distinct plasmids, 38.1% of which carried AMR genes. The plasmids in this population were diverse, mostly unreported and included 38 replicon types, with F-type plasmids (n=22) the most prevalent amongst those carrying AMR genes.\n\nFine-scale analysis of all plasmids identified numerous AMR gene contexts and emphasised the importance of IS elements, specifically members of the IS6/IS26 family, in the creation of complex multi-drug resistance regions. We found a concerning convergence of ESBL and colistin resistance determinants, with three plasmids from two different F-type lineages carrying blaCTX-M and mcr genes. The extensive diversity seen here highlights the worrying probability that stable new vehicles for AMR will evolve in E. coli populations that can disseminate internationally through travel networks.\n\nImpact StatementThe global spread of AMR is closely associated with international travel. AMR is a severe global concern and has compromised treatment options for many bacterial pathogens, among them pathogens carrying ESBL and colistin resistance genes. Colonising MDR organisms have the potential to cause serious consequences. Infections caused by MDR bacteria are associated with longer hospitalisation, poorer patient outcomes, greater mortality, and higher costs compared to infections with susceptible bacteria.\n\nThis study elucidates the numerous different types of plasmids carrying AMR genes in colonising ESBL-producing E. coli isolates found in faecal samples from in travellers to Vientiane, Laos. Here we add to known databases of AMR plasmids by adding these MDR plasmids found in Southeast Asia, an area of high AMR prevalence. We characterised novel AMR plasmids including complex ESBL (blaCTX-M) and colistin (mcr) resistance co-carriage plasmids, emphasising the potential exposure of travellers to Laos to a wide variety of mobile genetic elements that may facilitate global AMR spread. This in-depth study has revealed further detail of the numerous factors that may influence AMR transfer, therefore potential routes of AMR spread internationally, and is a step towards finding methods to combat AMR spread.\n\nData SummaryLong-read sequencing data is available through National Center for Biotechnology Information under the BioProject PRJNA853172. Complete plasmid sequences have been uploaded to GenBank with accession numbers in supplementary S1.

    "abstract": "White adipose tissue is deposited mainly as subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), often associated with metabolic protection, and abdominal/visceral adipose tissue (VAT), which contributes to metabolic disease. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of these differences, we conducted comprehensive proteomics profiling of whole tissue and isolated adipocytes from these two depots across two diets from C57Bl/6J mice. The adipocyte proteomes from lean mice were highly conserved between depots, with the major depot-specific differences encoded by just 3% of the proteome. Adipocytes from SAT (SAdi) were enriched in pathways related to mitochondrial complex I and beiging, whereas visceral adipocytes (VAdi) were enriched in structural proteins and positive regulators of mTOR presumably to promote nutrient storage and cellular expansion. This indicates that SAdi are geared toward higher catabolic activity, while VAdi are more suited for lipid storage.\n\nBy comparing adipocytes from mice fed chow or Western diet (WD), we define a core adaptive proteomics signature consisting of increased extracellular matrix proteins and decreased fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial Coenzyme Q biosynthesis. Relative to SAdi, VAdi displayed greater changes with WD including a pronounced decrease in mitochondrial proteins concomitant with upregulation of apoptotic signaling and decreased mitophagy, indicating pervasive mitochondrial stress. Furthermore, WD caused reduction in lipid handling and glucose uptake pathways particularly in VAdi, consistent with adipocyte de-differentiation. By overlaying the proteomics changes with diet in whole adipose tissue and isolated adipocytes, we uncovered concordance between adipocytes and tissue only in the VAT, indicating a unique tissue-specific adaptation to sustained WD in SAT.\n\nFinally, an in-depth comparison of isolated adipocytes and 3T3-L1 proteomes revealed a high degree of overlap, supporting the utility of the 3T3-L1 adipocyte model. These deep proteomes provide an invaluable resource highlighting differences between white adipose depots that may fine-tune their unique functions and adaptation to an obesogenic environment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe relationship between the use of tobacco products and SARS-CoV-2 infection is poorly understood and controversial. Most studies have been done with tobacco cigarettes, while few have examined the effect of electronic cigarettes (ECs) on SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tested the hypothesis that EC fluids and aerosols with high concentrations of nicotine promote SARS-COV-2 infection by increasing viral entry into human respiratory epithelial cells.\n\nMethodsResponses of BEAS-2B cells to authentic JUUL aerosols or their individual constituents (propylene glycol (PG)/vegetable glycerin (VG) and nicotine) were compared using three exposure platforms: submerged culture, air-liquid-interface (ALI) exposure in a cloud chamber, and ALI exposure in a Cultex(R) system, which produces authentic heated EC aerosols. SARS-CoV-2 infection machinery was assessed using immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Specifically, the levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 (angiotensin converting enzyme 2) and a spike modifying enzyme, TMPRSS2 (transmembrane serine protease 2), were evaluated. Following each exposure, lentivirus pseudoparticles with spike protein and a green-fluorescent reporter were used to test viral penetration and the susceptibility of BEAS-2B cells to infection.\n\nResultsNicotine, EC fluids, and authentic JUUL aerosols increased both ACE2 levels and TMPRSS2 activity, which in turn increased viral particle entry into cells. While most data were in good agreement across the three exposure platforms, cells were more responsive to treatments when exposed at the ALI in the Cultex system, even though the exposures were brief and intermittent. In the Cultex system, PG/VG, PG/VG/nicotine, and JUUL aerosols significantly increased infection above clean air controls. However, both the PG/VG and JUUL treatments were significantly lower than nicotine/PG/VG. PG/VG increased infection only in the Cultex(R) system, which produces heated aerosol.\n\nConclusionOur data are consistent with the conclusion that authentic JUUL aerosols or their individual constituents (nicotine or PG/VG) increase SARS-CoV-2 infection. The strong effect produced by nicotine was modulated in authentic JUUL aerosols, demonstrating the importance of studying mixtures and aerosols from actual EC products. These data support the idea that vaping increases the likelihood of contracting COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is essential for viral replication and has been the focus of many drug discovery efforts since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nirmatrelvir (NTV) is an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro that is used in the combination drug Paxlovid for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19. However, with increased use of NTV across the globe, there is a possibility that future SARS-CoV-2 lineages will evolve resistance to NTV. Early prediction and monitoring of resistance mutations could allow for measures to slow the spread of resistance and for the development of new compounds with activity against resistant strains. In this work, we have used in silico mutational scanning and inhibitor docking of Mpro to identify potential resistance mutations. Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed five mutations (N142L, E166M, Q189E, Q189I, and Q192T) that reduce the potency of NTV and of a previously identified non-covalent cyclic peptide inhibitor of Mpro. The E166M mutation reduced the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of NTV 24-fold, and 118-fold for the non-covalent peptide inhibitor. Our findings inform the ongoing genomic surveillance of emerging SARS-CoV-2 lineages.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=122 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/505060v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14f0713org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15995feorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8689a7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b73a64_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Insertion sequences (IS) are simple transposons implicated in the genome evolution of diverse pathogenic bacterial species. Enterococci have emerged as important human intestinal pathogens with newly adapted virulence potential and antibiotic resistance. These genetic features arose in tandem with large-scale genome evolution mediated by mobile elements. Pathoadaptation in enterococci is thought to be mediated in part by the IS element IS256 through gene inactivation and recombination events. However, the regulation of IS256 and the mechanisms controlling its activation are not well understood. Here, we adapt an IS256-specfic deep sequencing method to describe how chronic lytic phage infection drives widespread diversification of IS256 in E. faecalis and how antibiotic exposure is associated with IS256 diversification in both E. faecalis and E. faecium during a clinical human infection. We show through comparative genomics that IS256 is primarily found in hospital-adapted enterococcal isolates. Analyses of IS256 transposase gene levels reveal that IS256 mobility is regulated at the transcriptional level by multiple mechanisms in E. faecalis, indicating tight control of IS256 activation in the absence of selective pressure. Our findings reveal that stressors such as phages and antibiotic exposure drives rapid genome-scale transposition in the enterococci. IS256 diversification can therefore explain how selective pressures mediate evolution of the enterococcal genome, ultimately leading to the emergence of dominant nosocomial lineages that threaten human health.\n\nAuthor SummaryInsertion sequence (IS) elements are simple transposons that are ubiquitous in bacteria. In the enterococci, which includes medically relevant species such as Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the IS element IS256 is widespread and has been implicated in pathogenesis and antibiotic resistance. Despite the importance of IS256 to the biology of the enterococci, we know very about how this element is regulated and diversifies enterococcal genomes. Here, we show that IS256 is preferentially found in hospital-adapted and virulent strains of the enterococci. In E. faecalis V583, a vancomycin resistant blood isolate, IS256 is regulated by multiple transcriptional mechanisms. To understand how IS256 is mobilized, we adapted an Illumina-based deep sequencing method called IS-Seq to find novel IS256 insertions when applying the selective pressure of bacteriophage (phage) predation. Using this method, we found that chronic phage infection drives IS256 diversification of the E. faecalis V583 genome. Additionally, we tracked IS256 insertional activity during a human E. faecium infection and found that increased IS256 diversity was associated with specific antibiotic usage. Together, our results demonstrate that the enterococci control IS256 activity to diversify their genomes which may lead to the emergence of hospital-adapted strains that threaten human health.",

    "abstract": "Natural competence is an important means of horizontal gene transfer that bacteria use to gain new physiological traits such as multiple drug resistance. Most naturally competent bacteria tightly regulate the window of competence state to maximize their ecological fitness under specific conditions. Here we study the inhibitory effect of purine nucleotides on the natural competence in Haemophilus influenzae Rd KW20. We first identified a periplasmic acid phosphatase AphAEc of E. coli as a new cyclic AMP (cAMP)-binding protein. cAMP competitively inhibits AphAEc. Subsequently, we found that cAMP also competitively inhibits AphAHi and two additional periplasmic phosphatases NadNHi and HelHi of KW20. HelHi cleaves NADP to NAD, and NadNHi cleaves NAD to NMN and NR (nicotinamide ribose), providing the essential growth factor V for KW20. Consistently, we found that cAMP inhibits growth of KW20 in sBHI medium supplemented with NAD, but not NR. Moreover, the combined deletion of aphAHi, nadNHi, and helHi, but not the single or double deletion mutants, made KW20 immune to the inhibition of nucleotides on competence development. However, nucleosides still inhibited the competence of the triple mutant. Finally, cAMP in a dose-dependent manner restored the competence inhibited by the nucleotide GMP, but not by the nucleoside guanosine. Altogether, we revealed an antagonistic mechanism of cAMP and nucleotides in regulating cell growth and competence of H. influenzae. Similar mechanisms are discussed in other H. influenzae related organisms and Vibrio cholerae.\n\nAuthor summaryHaemophilus influenzae is an important human pathogen, causing respiratory tract infection including pneumonia. Extensive drug resistance is observed in Haemophilus influenzae species, which is attributed to their well-described natural competence system. Natural competence is a physiological state that some bacteria, under certain conditions, become active to take up external DNA and integrate it into the chromosome. External DNA may contain an antibiotic resistance gene and thereby confer antibiotic resistance on Haemophilus influenzae. Therefore, it is important to understand how natural competence of Haemophilus influenzae is regulated by external cues. Previously, it was found that the secondary messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) activates while nucleotides inhibit the competence development of Haemophilus influenzae Rd KW20. However, the interplay between cAMP and nucleotides is unclear. Here we show that cAMP competitively inhibits three periplasmic phosphatases of Haemophilus influenzae Rd KW20 and thereby inhibits the utilization of nutritional nucleotides and the essential growth factor NAD. Via this mechanism, cAMP activates the competence development of Haemophilus influenzae Rd KW20 only after external nucleotides are sufficiently depleted, coupling growth arrest with competence development. Similar mechanisms are anticipated to function in bacteria closely related to Haemophilus influenzaee, and also Vibrio cholerae, another important human pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli has been used as an indicator of fecal pollution in environmental waters. However, its presence in environmental waters does not provide information on the source of water pollution. Identifying the source of water pollution is paramount to be able to effectively reduce contamination. The present study aimed to identify E. coli microbial source tracking (MST) markers that can be used to identify domestic wastewater contamination in environmental waters. We first analyzed wastewater E. coli genomes sequenced by us (n = 50) and RefSeq animal E. coli genomes of fecal origin (n = 82), and identified 144 candidate wastewater-associated marker genes. The sensitivity and specificity of the candidate marker genes were then assessed by screening the genes in 335 RefSeq wastewater E. coli genomes and 3,318 RefSeq animal E. coli genomes. We finally identified two MST markers, namely W_nqrC and W_clsA_2, which could be used for detection of wastewater-associated E. coli isolates. These two markers showed higher performance than the previously developed human wastewater-associated E. coli markers H8 and H12. When used in combination, W_nqrC and W_clsA_2 showed specificity of 98.9% and sensitivity of 25.7%. PCR assays to detect W_nqrC and W_clsA_2 were also developed and validated. The developed PCR assays are potentially useful for detecting E. coli isolates of wastewater origin in environmental waters, though users should keep in mind that the sensitivity of these markers is not high. Further studies are needed to assess the applicability of the developed markers to a culture-independent approach.",

    "abstract": "Coxiella burnetii is an obligate zoonotic bacterium that targets macrophages to cause a disease known as Q fever. It has a biphasic developmental lifecycle where the extracellular and metabolically inactive small cell variant (SCV) transforms, under host acidic environment, into the vegetative large cell variant (LCV). However, the details about the morphological and structural changes that accompany this biphasic cycle are still lacking. Here, we used cryo-electron tomography to image the different cell variants of C. burnetii grown either under axenic conditions in different pH or purified directly from host cells revealing the major developmental, morphological and structural transitions. We show that SCVs are characterized by equidistant stacks of inner membrane that presumably allow a smooth transition to LCV, a transition coupled with the expression of the Dot/Icm type IVB secretion system (T4BSS). A class of T4BSS particles were associated with extracellular densities including a tubular structure possibly involved in host interaction or effector delivery. Also, SCVs and cells in the transition state contained spherical multilayered membrane structures of different sizes and locations suggesting that they are not related to a sporulation process as once assumed.",

Virus entry into host cells occurs via membrane fusion in late endosomes; however, the mechanism of how the remarkably long virions undergo uncoating including virion disassembly and nucleocapsid release into the cytosol, remains unknown. Here, we investigate the structural architecture of EBOVs entering host cells and discover that the VP40 matrix disassembles prior to membrane fusion. We reveal that VP40 disassembly is caused by the weakening of VP40-lipid interactions driven by low endosomal pH that equilibrates passively across the viral envelope without a dedicated ion channel. We further show that viral membrane fusion depends on VP40 matrix integrity, and its disassembly reduces the energy barrier for fusion stalk formation. Thus, pH-driven structural remodeling of the VP40 matrix acts as a molecular switch coupling viral matrix uncoating to membrane fusion during EBOV entry.",

    "abstract": "Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), produce heat-labile (LT) and/or heat-stable (ST) enterotoxins, and are a common cause of diarrhea in children of resource-poor regions. ETEC have also been linked repeatedly to poorly understood sequelae including enteropathy, malnutrition, and growth impairment. While the cellular actions of ETEC enterotoxins leading to diarrhea are well-established, their potential contribution to subsequent pathology is unclear. LT stimulates cellular cAMP production to activate protein kinase A (PKA) which phosphorylates cellular ion channels that drive export of salt and water into the intestinal lumen resulting in diarrhea. However, as PKA exhibits broad kinase activity and its activated catalytic subunits modulate transcription of many genes, we interrogated the transcriptional profiles of LT-treated small intestinal epithelia. These studies demonstrated toxin-induced changes in hundreds of genes including those required for biogenesis and function of the brush border, the major site absorption of nutrients, and suppression of a key transcription factors, HNF4 and SMAD4, critical to differentiation of intestinal epithelia. Accordingly, LT treatment of intestinal epithelial cells significantly disrupted the absorptive microvillus architecture and altered transport of essential nutrients. In addition, challenge of neonatal mice with LT-producing ETEC recapitulated the architectural derangement of the brush border while maternal vaccination with LT prevented brush border disruption in ETEC-challenged neonatal mice. Finally, mice repeatedly challenged with toxigenic ETEC exhibited impaired growth recapitulating the multiplicative impact of recurring ETEC infections in children. These findings highlight impacts of ETEC enterotoxins beyond acute diarrheal illness and may inform approaches to mitigate and prevent major sequelae including malnutrition that impact millions of young children.",

    "abstract": "Energy transfer from light-harvesting ketocarotenoids to light-driven proton pumps xanthorhodopsins has been previously demonstrated in two unique cases: an extreme halophilic bacterium1 and a terrestrial cyanobacterium2. Attempts to find carotenoids that bind and transfer energy to rhodopsin proton pumps from the abundant marine and freshwater photoheterotrophs have thus far failed3-5. Here, using functional metagenomics combined with chromophore extraction from the environment, we detected light energy transfer from the widespread hydroxylated carotenoids zeaxanthin and lutein to the retinal moiety of xanthorhodopsins and proteorhodopsins. The light-harvesting carotenoids transfer up to 42% of the harvested energy in the violet/blue-light range to the green-light absorbing retinal chromophore. Our data suggest that these antennas have a significant impact on rhodopsin phototrophy in the worlds lakes, seas and oceans.",

    "abstract": "The interferon (IFN)-inducible 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) - RNase L pathway plays a critical role in antiviral immunity. Group A rotaviruses, including the simian SA11 strain, inhibit this pathway through two activities: an E3-ligase related activity of NSP1 that degrades proteins necessary for IFN signaling, and a phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity of VP3 that hydrolyzes the RNase L-activator 2',5'-oligoadenylate. Unexpectedly, we found that a recombinant (r) SA11 double-mutant virus deficient in both activities (rSA11-VP3H797R-NSP1{Delta}C17) retained the ability to prevent RNase L activation. Mass spectrometry led to the discovery that NSP1 interacts with RNase L in rSA11-infected MA104 cells. This interaction was confirmed through co-pulldown assay of cells transiently expressing NSP1 and RNase L. Immunoblot analysis showed that infection with wild type rSA11 virus, rSA11-VP3H797R-NSP1{Delta}C17 double-mutant virus, or single mutant forms of the latter virus, all resulted in the depletion of endogenous RNase L. The loss of RNase L was reversed by addition of the neddylation inhibitor MLN4924, but not the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Analysis of additional mutant forms of rSA11 showed that RNase L degradation no longer occurred when either the N-terminal RING domain of NSP1 was mutated or the C-terminal 98 amino acids of NSP1 were deleted. The C-terminal RNase L degradation domain is positioned upstream and is functionally independent of the NSP1 domain necessary for inhibiting IFN expression. Our studies reveal a new role for NSP1 and its E3-ligase related activity as an antagonist of RNase L and uncover a novel virus-mediated strategy of inhibiting the OAS-RNase L pathway.\n\nIMPORTANCEFor productive infection, rotavirus and other RNA viruses must suppress interferon (IFN) signaling and the expression of IFN-stimulated antiviral gene products. Particularly important is inhibiting the interferon (IFN)-inducible 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) - RNase L pathway, as activated RNase L can direct the nonspecific degradation of viral and cellular RNAs, thereby blocking viral replication and triggering cell death pathways. In this study, we have discovered that the simian SA11 strain of rotavirus employs a novel strategy of inhibiting the OAS-RNase L pathway. This strategy is mediated by SA11 NSP1, a nonstructural protein that hijacks E3 cullin-RING ligases, causing the ubiquitination and degradation of host proteins essential for IFN induction. Our analysis shows that SA11 NSP1 also recognizes and causes the ubiquitination of RNase L, an activity resulting in depletion of endogenous RNase L. These data raise the possibility of using therapeutics targeting cellular E3 ligases to control rotavirus infections.",

However, nearly all of these antibodies have been rendered obsolete by SARS-CoV-2 variants that evolved to resist similar, naturally occurring antibodies. Here, we describe the development of human monoclonal antibodies that bind the ACE2 receptor rather than the viral spike protein. These antibodies block infection by all ACE2 binding sarbecoviruses, including emergent SARS-CoV-2 variants. Structural and biochemical analyses revealed that the antibodies target an ACE2 epitope that engages SARS-CoV-2 spike. Importantly, the antibodies do not inhibit ACE2 enzymatic activity, nor do they induce ACE depletion from cell surfaces. The antibodies exhibit favorable pharmacology and protect human ACE2 knock-in mice against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such antibodies should be useful prophylactic and treatment agents against any current and future SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as ACE2-binding sarbecoviruses that might emerge as future pandemic threats.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 virus evolution occurs as a result of antigenic drift and shift. Although antigenic drift has been extensively studied, antigenic shift, which for SARS-CoV-2 occurs through genetic recombination, has been examined scarcely. To gain a better understanding of the emergence and prevalence of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 lineages through time and space, we analyzed SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences from public databases. Our study revealed an extraordinary increase in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 recombinant lineages during the Omicron wave, particularly in Northern America and Europe. This phenomenon was independent of sequencing density or genetic diversity of circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. In SARS-CoV-2 genomes, recombination breakpoints were found to be more concentrated in the 3 UTR followed by ORF1a. Additionally, we noted enrichment of certain amino acids in the spike protein of recombinant lineages, which have been reported to confer immune escape from neutralizing antibodies, increase ACE2 receptor binding, and enhance viral transmission in some cases. Overall, we report an important and timely observation of accelerated recombination in the currently circulating Omicron variants and explore their potential contribution to viral fitness, particularly immune escape.",

PPR transforms solar energy to cellular energy used for various metabolic processes in the cells or flagellar movement. Although rhodopsins or their encoding genes have been documented in a wide phylogenetic range of cultured dinoflagellates, information is limited about how widespread and how spatiotemporally dynamical dinoflagellate PPR (DiPPR) are in the marine ecosystem. In this study, using the quantitative PCR method, we investigated the abundance and diversity of DiPPR genes in Long Island Sound (LIS), a temperate estuary, both spatially and temporally in 2010. DiPPR genes were found year-round and throughout LIS, with higher abundances in the eutrophic Western Sound and during April and July. The gene diversity data suggest that there are at least five distinct rhodopsin-harboring groups of dinoflagellates throughout the year. The abundance of DiPPR genes, measured as copy number per mL seawater, appeared not to be influenced by water temperature and nitrogen nutrient concentration; however, weak negative correlations with orthophosphate concentration and salinity and a positive correlation with the abundance of typical-DiPPR-harboring dinoflagellates were observed. The association of DiPPR with phosphorus nutrition warrants further studies.",

    "abstract": "Invasive aspergillosis remains one of the most devastating fungal diseases and is predominantly linked to infections caused by the opportunistic human mold pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. Major treatment regimens for the disease comprise the administration of antifungals belonging to the azole, polyene and echinocandin drug class. The prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5FC), which is the only representative of a fourth class, the nucleobase analogs, shows unsatisfactory in vitro activities and is barely used for the treatment of aspergillosis. The main route of 5FC activation in A. fumigatus comprises its deamination into 5-fluorouracil (5FU) by FcyA, which is followed by Uprt-mediated 5FU phosphoribosylation into 5-fluorouridine monophosphate (5FUMP). In this study, we characterized and examined the role of a metabolic bypass that generates this nucleotide via 5-fluorouridine (5FUR) through uridine phosphorylase and uridine kinase activities. Resistance profiling of mutants lacking distinct pyrimidine salvage activities suggested a minor contribution of the alternative route in 5FUMP formation. We further analyzed the contribution of drug efflux in 5FC tolerance and found that A. fumigatus cells exposed to 5FC reduce intracellular fluoropyrimidine levels through their export into the environment. This release, which was particularly high in mutants lacking Uprt, generates a toxic environment for cytosine deaminase lacking mutants as well as mammalian cells. Employing the broad-spectrum fungal efflux pump inhibitor clorgyline, we demonstrate synergistic properties of this compound in combination with 5FC, 5FU as well as 5FUR.",

    "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) approaches enable sensitive detection of rare aquatic species. However, water conditions like turbidity can limit sensitivity, resulting in false negative detections. The dynamics of eDNA detection in turbid conditions are poorly understood, but can be better characterized through experimental work. In this study, 1-L field-collected water samples were spiked with tank-sourced eDNA from a rare, endangered estuarine fish at concentrations similar to eDNA samples collected from the natural environment. Samples using non-turbid water (5 NTU), turbid water (50 NTU), and prefiltered turbid water were filtered using four filter types (pore size range 0.45 m-10 m). Detection success using a species-specific Taqman qPCR assay was assessed as both eDNA copy number and detection/non-detection. Glass fiber filters (nominal pore size 1.6 m) yielded the highest number of eDNA copies and detections in non-turbid water and the highest detection rate in turbid water when used without a prefilter. Detection was a more robust metric for evaluating species presence across turbidity conditions compared with eDNA copy number. Prefiltration improved detection rates for the other filters tested (polycarbonate and cartridge filters). Filter material and design appear to interact differently with the prefiltration step, and may be more important considerations than pore size for eDNA capture in turbid water. Interactions between eDNA particles, suspended particulate matter, and filters are important to consider for eDNA methods optimization and interpretation of rare species detections in turbid water.",

In addition to the canonical poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), plant specific SRO (Similar to RCD One) family also contain the catalytic core of the PARP domain. However, whether the PARP domains in SROs execute the ART function is still under debate. In 2014, we reported a wheat SRO, Ta-sro1, had the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity and enhanced wheat seedling growth and abiotic stress resistance, however, a recent work by Vogt et al. showed that Ta-sro1 without ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. Based on the recent progress on PARPs and SROs in relation to ADP-ribosyltransferase activity, along with our former and recent evolving results, we argued that Ta-sro1 is a non-canonical ADP-ribosyltransferase with the enzymatic activity. Although we have revealed the novel mechanism of Ta-sro1 regulate redox homeostasis and enhance salinity stress tolerance through interacting with TaSIP1, it is of interest to further clarify whether and how the enzymatic activity of Ta-sro1 responsible for the salinity tolerance of wheat.

    "abstract": "Faithful and timely repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is fundamental for the maintenance of genomic integrity. Here, we demonstrate that the meiotic recombination co-factor MND1 facilitates the repair of DSBs in somatic cells. We show that MND1 localizes to DSBs, where it stimulates DNA repair through homologous recombination (HR). Importantly, MND1 is not involved in the response to replication-associated DSBs, implying that it is dispensable for HR-mediated repair of one-ended DSBs. Instead, we find that MND1 specifically plays a role in the response to two-ended DSBs that are induced by IR or various chemotherapeutic drugs, specifically in G2. MND1 localization to DSBs is dependent on resection of the DNA ends, and seemingly occurs through direct binding of MND1 to RAD51-coated ssDNA. Importantly, the lack of MND1-driven HR repair directly potentiates the toxicity of IR-induced damage, which could open new possibilities for therapeutic intervention, specifically in HR-proficient tumors.",

In order to elucidate enzyme:acetyl-CoA interactions leading to catalysis, acetyl-CoA substrate analogs are needed. One possible analog for use in structural studies is acetyl-oxa(dethia)CoA (AcOCoA), where the thioester sulfur of CoA is replaced by an oxygen. Here we present structures of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase III (CATIII) and E. coli ketoacylsynthase III (FabH) from crystals grown in the presence of partially hydrolyzed AcOCoA and the respective nucleophile. Based on the structures, the behaviour of AcOCoA differs between the enzymes, with FabH reacting with AcOCoA and CATIII being unreactive. The structure of CATIII reveals insight into the catalytic mechanism, with one active site of the trimer having relatively clear electron density for AcOCoA and chloramphenicol, and the other active sites having weaker density for AcOCoA. One FabH structure has a hydrolyzed AcOCoA product oxa(dethia)CoA (OCoA) and the other FabH structure has an acyl-enzyme intermediate with OCoA. Together these structures provide preliminary insight into the use of AcOCoA for enzyme structure-function studies with different nucleophiles.\n\nSynopsisStable analogs of acetyl-CoA are needed to support structure-function studies of acetyltransferase enzymes.

    "abstract": "O-GalNAc type glycosylation is a common post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins catalyzed by polypeptide GalNAc transferases, but the substrate specificity of these transferases is poorly understood. Here we develop a strategy based on integral thermal proteome solubility profiling to identify and prioritize the protein substrates of polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 1 (GALNT1). Combined with glycoprotein enrichment followed by HCD and soft EThcD gas-phase fragmentation technique, we uncover hundreds of novel GALNT1 substrates in two model human cell lines. GALNT1-mediated O-glycosylation is more common on Thr than Ser residues, with a strong preference for Pro at positions +3 and +4 in respect to O-glycosylation. These results implicate GALNT1 in potentially regulating proteins in several diverse pathways, including some unexpected processes, such as TCA cycle and DNA transcription. This study depicts a roadmap for identification of functional substrates for glycosyltransferases, facilitating fundamental insight into the role of glycosylation in homeostasis and disease.",

    "abstract": "Ferroportin (Fpn) is a transporter that releases Fe2+ from cells and is important for iron homeostasis in circulation. Export of Fe2+ by Fpn is coupled to import of H+ to maintain charge balance. Although Ca2+ was shown to modulate Fe2+ transport in Fpn, transport of Ca2+ by Fpn has not been demonstrated. Here we show that human Fpn (HsFpn) mediates Ca2+ transport, and that the Ca2+ transport does not rely on the transport of other ions. We determine the structure of Ca2+-bound HsFpn and identify a single Ca2+ binding site distinct from the Fe2+ binding sites. Further studies validate the Ca2+ binding site and show that Ca2+ transport is inhibited in the presence of Fe2+ but not vice versa. Function of Fpn as a Ca2+ uniporter in the absence of Fe2+ provides a molecular basis for regulations of iron homeostasis by Ca2+.",

    "abstract": "Activation of a conditional safety switch has the potential to reverse serious toxicities arising from the administration of engineered cellular therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The functionally inert, non-immunogenic cell surface marker derived from human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRt) is a promising safety switch that has been used in multiple clinical constructs and can be targeted by cetuximab, a clinically available monoclonal antibody. However, this approach requires high and persistent cell surface expression of EGFRt to ensure that antibody mediated depletion of engineered cells is rapid and complete. Here we show that incorporating a short juxtamembrane sequence into the EGFRt polypeptide enhances its expression on the surface of T cells and their susceptibility to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Incorporating this optimized variant (EGFRopt) into bicistronic and tricistronic CAR designs results in more rapid in vivo elimination of CAR T cells and robust termination of their effector activity compared to EGFRt. These studies establish EGFRopt as a superior safety switch for the development of next-generation cell-based therapeutics.",

Here, we developed murine alleles of the KEAP1 and NRF2 mutations found in human NSCLC and comprehensively interrogated their impact on tumor initiation and progression. Chronic Nrf2 stabilization by Keap1 or Nrf2 mutation was not sufficient to induce tumorigenesis, even in the absence of tumor suppressors p53 or Lkb1. When combined with KrasG12D/+, constitutive Nrf2 activation promoted lung tumor initiation and early progression of hyperplasia to low-grade tumors but impaired their progression to advanced-grade tumors, which was reversed by Nrf2 deletion. Finally, NRF2 overexpression in KEAP1 mutant NSCLC cell lines was detrimental to cell proliferation, viability, and anchorage-independent colony formation. Collectively, our results establish the context-dependence and activity threshold for NRF2 during the lung tumorigenic process.\n\nSignificanceThis study reports murine lung cancer models harboring mutations in the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and highlights the context-dependent and diverse roles of Nrf2 during lung tumor initiation and progression.",

    "abstract": "FFPE (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) tissue archives are the largest repository of clinically annotated human specimens. Despite numerous advances in technology, current methods for sequencing of FFPE-fixed single-cells are slow, labour intensive, insufficiently sensitive and have a low resolution, making it difficult to fully exploit their enormous research and clinical potential. Here we introduce single nuclei pathology sequencing (snPATHO-Seq), a sensitive and efficient high-throughput platform to profile the transcriptome of single nuclei extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples. snPATHO-Seq combines an optimised nuclei extraction protocol from archival samples with 10x Genomics probe-based technology targeting the whole transcriptome. We performed direct comparison of the Fixed RNA Profiling (FRP) and established 3 single cell RNA-Sequencing (scRNA-Seq) workflows through a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of matched fresh and fixed samples derived from the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line. FRP detected 2.1 times more transcripts in the fixed sample than the 3 kit did in the fresh sample. Low mitochondrial genes detection using the FRP was translated into 99.9 percent of cells passing the QC filters, compared to 81.6 percent of cells using the v3.1 chemistry. We then optimized snPATHO-Seq and applied it to a human breast cancer metastasis to the liver collected at autopsy and preserved in FFPE, a particularly challenging sample type. Remarkably, at 28,000 reads/cell snPATHO-Seq was able to detect a median of 1850 genes/cell and 3,216 UMI counts/cell. Comparison of snPATHO-Seq with spatial transcriptomics data (10x Genomics Visium FFPE v1) derived from an adjacent section of the same sample revealed a strong correlation, validating the accuracy of the snPATHO-Seq data. Gene expression data from snPATHO-Seq was used to predict cell type composition within each spatial transcriptomic location via deconvolution. Overall, snPATHO-Seq enables high quality and sensitivity snRNA-Seq from preserved tissue samples, unlocking the vast archives of FFPE tissues and thereby allowing extensive retrospective clinical genomic studies.",

    "abstract": "Leptospira interrogans are pathogenic bacteria responsible for leptospirosis, a worldwide zoonosis. All vertebrates can be infected, and some species like humans are susceptible to the disease whereas rodents such as mice are resistant and become asymptomatic renal carriers. Leptospires are stealth bacteria that are known to escape several immune recognition pathways and resist killing mechanisms. We recently published that leptospires may survive intracellularly and exit macrophages, in part by escaping xenophagy, a pathogen-targeting form of autophagy. Interestingly, autophagy is one of the antimicrobial mechanisms often highjacked by bacteria to evade the host immune response. In this study we therefore explored whether leptospires subvert the key molecular players of autophagy to facilitate the infection. We showed in macrophages that leptospires triggered a specific accumulation of autophagy-adaptor p62 in puncta-like structures, without major alteration of autophagy flux. Unlike active bacterial mechanisms described to date, we demonstrated that leptospires trigger p62 accumulation using a passive mechanism of LPS signaling via TLR4/TLR2. p62 is a central pleiotropic protein, not only involved in autophagy, but also mediating cell stress and death, via the translocation of transcription factors. We demonstrated that Leptospira-driven accumulation of p62 induced the translocation of transcription factor NRF2. However, NRF2 translocation upon Leptospira infection did not result as expected in antioxydant response, but dampened the production of inflammatory mediators such as iNOS/NO, TNF and IL6. Overall, these findings highlight a novel passive bacterial mechanism linked to p62/NRF2 signaling that decreases inflammation and contributes to the stealthiness of leptospires.",

Statin-class compounds are known to selectively inhibit eukaryotic and archaeal versions of HMG Co-A reductase (class-I) enzyme and the bacterial version of the same enzyme (class-II) is known to be unresponsive to statins. The results of this study demonstrated that the two model statin compounds Simvastatin and Atorvastatin were effective in suppressing methanogenesis in MFCs when applied in moderate concentrations (5 mg/L and 40 mg/L respectively) in MFC anodes. Power densities increased 2 fold compared to control (to 63 {+/-} 1.8 mW/m2) and 2.5 fold (to 69.5 {+/-} 1.8 mW/m2) with Simvastatin and Atorvastatin addition respectively. There was an almost complete suppression of CH4 production with the addition of both statins into MFC anodes as shown by gas composition analysis. Quantitative FISH (qFISH) analysis showed that methanogens Methanosarcina, Metanobacteria and Methanomicrobiales together with all archaea were almost completely suppressed when statins were supplemented into MFC anodes. This study demonstrated that the statins addition can be used to boost power densities in MFCs.",

    "abstract": "Heteroresistance - in which a clonal bacterial population contains a cell subpopulation with higher resistance to antibiotics than the main population - is a growing clinical problem that complicates susceptibility determination and threatens therapeutic success. Despite the high prevalence of heteroresistance in clinical settings, the underlying genetic mechanisms that stably maintain heterogeneous bacterial populations are poorly understood. Using fluorescence microscopy, single-cell microfluidics, and quantitative image analysis, we show that random replication and segregation of multicopy plasmids produce populations of bacterium Escherichia coli MG1655 in which cells with low-and high-plasmid copy numbers stably co-exist. By combining stochastic simulations of a computational model with high-throughput single-cell measurements of blaTEM-1 expression, we show that copy number variability confers the bacterial population with transient resistance to a lethal concentration of a {beta} -lactam antibiotic. Moreover, this surviving, high plasmid copy minority is capable of regenerating a heterogeneous bacterial population with low and high plasmid copy numbers through segregational instability, rapidly alleviating the fitness burden of carrying large numbers of plasmids. Our results provide further support for the tenet that plasmids are more than simple vehicles for horizontal transmission of genetic information between cells, as they can also drive bacterial adaptation in dynamic environments by providing a platform for rapid amplification and attenuation of gene copy number that can accelerate the rate of resistance adaptation and can lead to treatment failure.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial response to changes in cellular energy demand is necessary for cellular adaptation and organ function. Many genes are essential in orchestrating this response, including the transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta}1 target gene MSS51, which is an inhibitor of skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism. Despite the potential importance of MSS51 in the pathophysiology of obesity and musculoskeletal disease, how MSS51 is regulated is not entirely understood. Site-1 Protease (S1P) is a Golgi-resident protease that is a key activator of several transcription factors required for cellular adaptation. However, the role of S1P in muscle and mitochondrial function are unknown. Here, we identify S1P as a negative regulator of muscle mass and mitochondrial metabolism. Disruption of S1P in mouse skeletal muscle and cultured myofibers leads to a reduction in MSS51 expression, increased muscle mass, and increased mitochondrial oxygen consumption. The effects of S1P deficiency on mitochondrial activity are counteracted by overexpressing MSS51, suggesting that S1P inhibits mitochondrial metabolism by regulating the expression of MSS51. Furthermore, S1P suppression enhances TGF-{beta} signaling via the AKT pathway, potentially explaining muscle hypertrophy in S1P deficient mice. The discovery of S1P as a regulator of mitochondrial metabolism and muscle mass expands our understanding of TGF-{beta} signaling and suggests this protease could be a target for therapeutic intervention in muscle.",

    "abstract": "Expansion of a single repetitive DNA sequence, termed a tandem repeat (TR), is known to cause more than 50 diseases. However, repeat expansions are often not explored beyond neurological and neurodegenerative disorders. In some cancers, mutations accumulate in short tracts of TRs (STRs), a phenomenon termed microsatellite instability (MSI); however larger repeat expansions have not been systematically analyzed in cancer. Here, we identified TR expansions in 2,622 cancer genomes, spanning 29 cancer types. In 7 cancer types, we found 160 recurrent repeat expansions (rREs); most of these (155/160) were subtype specific. We found that rREs were non-uniformly distributed in the genome with an enrichment near candidate cis-regulatory elements, suggesting a role in gene regulation. One rRE located near a regulatory element in the first intron of UGT2B7 was detected in 34% of renal cell carcinoma samples and was validated by long-read DNA sequencing. Moreover, targeting cells harboring this rRE with a rationally designed, sequence-specific DNA binder led to a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation. Overall, our results demonstrate that rREs are an important but unexplored source of genetic variation in human cancers, and we provide a comprehensive catalog for further study.",

    "abstract": "The shell proteins that comprise bacterial microcompartments (BMCs) can self-assemble into an array of superstructures such as nanotubes, flat sheets, and icosahedrons. Physical characterization of BMCs and these superstructures typically relies on electron microscopy, which decouples samples from their solution context. We hypothesize that an investigation of fluorescently tagged BMCs and shell protein superstructures in vitro with high resolution confocal microscopy will lead to new insights into the solution behavior of these entities. We find that confocal imaging is able to capture nanotubes and sheets previously reported by TEM. Using a combination of fluorescent tags, we present qualitative evidence that these structures intermix with one another in a hetero- and homotypic fashion. Complete BMCs are also able to accomplish intermixing as evidenced by colocalization data. Finally, a simple colocalization experiment suggests that fluorescently modified encapsulation peptides (EPs) may prefer certain shell protein binding partners. Together, these data demonstrate that high resolution confocal microscopy is a powerful tool for investigating microcompartment-related structures in vitro, particularly for colocalization analyses. These results also support the notion that BMCs may intermix protein components, presumably from the outer shell.\n\nImportanceMicrocompartments are large, organelle-like structures that help bacteria catabolize targeted metabolites, while also protecting the cytosol against highly reactive metabolic intermediates. Their protein shell self-assembles into a polyhedral structure of approximately 100-200 nm in diameter. Inside the shell are thousands of copies of cargo enzymes, which are responsible for a specific metabolic pathway. While different approaches have revealed high-resolution structures of individual microcompartment proteins, it is less clear how these factors self-assemble to form the full native structure. In this study, we show that laser scanning confocal microscopy can be used to study microcompartment proteins. We find that this approach allows researchers to investigate the interactions and potential exchange of shell protein subunits in solution. From this, we conclude that confocal microscopy offers advantages for studying the in vitro structures of other microcompartments, as well as carboxysomes and other bacterial organelles.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms by which information and misinformation spread through groups of individual actors is essential to the prediction of phenomena ranging from coordinated group behaviours [1-3] to global misinformation epidemics [4-7]. Transmission of information through groups depends on the decision-making strategies individuals use to transform the perceived actions of others into their own behavioural actions [8-10]. Because it is often not possible to directly infer these strategies in situ, most studies of behavioural spread in groups assume individuals make decisions by pooling [7, 8, 10, 11] or averaging [8, 9] the actions or behavioural states of neighbours. Whether individuals adopt more sophisticated strategies that exploit socially-transmitted information, while remaining robust to misinformation exposure, is unknown. Here we uncover the impacts of individual decision-making on misinformation spread in natural groups of wild coral reef fish, where misinformation occurs in the form of false alarms that can spread contagiously. Using automated tracking and visual field reconstruction, we infer the precise sequences of socially-transmitted stimuli perceived by each individual during decision-making. Our analysis reveals a novel feature of decision-making essential for controlling misinformation spread: dynamic adjustments in sensitivity to socially-transmitted cues. We find that this property can be achieved by a simple and biologically widespread decision-making circuit. This form of dynamic gain control makes individual behaviour robust to natural fluctuations in misinformation exposure, and radically alters misinformation spread relative to predictions of widely-used models of social contagion.",

    "abstract": "Naturalistic neuroscience opened the door to new insights into neural circuits that serve real-world dynamic perception. Such studies have often neglected the rich texture of the movie narrative itself, but semantic content can be used to contextualize the induced neural responses. Here, we translated natural language processing tools from machine learning to characterize brain states estimated from hidden Markov models. Our analytical strategy allowed pitting shallow unimodal against the deep associative brain network layers in explaining how semantic content of the movie links to observed neural activity. Pooling information across >53,000 brain image time points watching Forrest Gump, we could show that distinct dynamic brain states capture unique semantic facets along the unfolding movie narrative. The spatiotemporal dynamics of brain states explicitly captured subject-level responses throughout the brain network hierarchy. Across all analyses, the default network was most intimately linked to semantic information integration, and this neural system switched online for longest durations during movie watching. Further, we identified and described two mechanisms of how the default network liaises dynamically with microanatomically defined subregion partners: the amygdala and the hippocampus. Our study thus unlocks the potential of natural language processing to explore neural processes in everyday life situations that engage key aspects of conscious awareness.",

    "abstract": "Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) connect distant cells and mediate cargo transfer for intercellular communication in physiological and pathological contexts. How cells generate these actin-mediated protrusions to span lengths beyond those attainable by canonical filopodia remains unknown. Through a combination of micropatterning, microscopy and optical tweezer-based approaches, we demonstrate that TNTs forming through the outward extension of actin (not through cellular dislodgement) achieve distances greater than the mean length of filopodia, and that branched Arp2/3-dependent pathways attenuate the extent to which actin polymerizes in nanotubes, limiting TNT occurrence. Proteomic analysis using Epidermal growth factor receptor kinase substrate 8 (Eps8) as a positive effector of TNTs showed that upon Arp2/3 inhibition, proteins enhancing filament turnover and depolymerization were reduced and Eps8 instead exhibited heightened interactions with the inverted Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (I-BAR) domain protein IRSp53 that provides a direct connection with linear actin polymerases. Our data reveals how common protrusion players (Eps8 and IRSp53) form TNTs, and that when competing pathways overutilizing such proteins and monomeric actin in Arp2/3 networks are inhibited, processes promoting linear actin growth dominate to favour TNT formation. Thus, this work reinforces a general principle for actin network control for cellular protrusions where simple shifts in the balance between processes that inhibit actin growth versus those that promote growth dictate protrusion formation and the ultimate length scales protrusions achieve.",

    "abstract": "Muscle proteins of the obscurin protein family play important roles in sarcomere organization, sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and T-tubule architecture and function. However, their precise molecular functions and redundancies between protein family members as well as their involvement in cardiac diseases remain to be fully understood.\n\nTo investigate the functional roles of obscurin and its close homologue obscurin-like 1 (Obsl1) in the heart, we generated and analyzed knockout mice for obscurin, Obsl1, as well as obscurin/Obsl1 double-knockouts (dKO). We show that dKO mice are viable but show postnatal deficits in cardiac muscle SR and mitochondrial architecture and function at the microscopic, biochemical and cellular level. Altered SR structure resulted in perturbed calcium cycling, while mitochondrial ultrastructure deficits were linked to decreased levels of Chchd3, a Micos complex protein. Hearts of dKO mice also show increased expression of Atg4d, a novel Obsl1 interacting protein, resulting in abnormal mitophagy and increased unfolded protein response. At the physiological level, loss of obscurin and Obsl1 resulted in a profound delay of cardiac relaxation, associated with metabolic signs of heart failure.\n\nTaken together, our data suggest that obscurin and Obsl1 play crucial roles in cardiac SR structure, calcium cycling, mitochondrial function, turnover and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Murine endogenous retrovirus with leucine tRNA primer, also known as MERVL, is expressed during zygotic genome activation in mammalian embryos. Here we show that protein arginine N-methyltransferase 6 (Prmt6) forms a chimeric transcript with MT2B2, one of the long terminal repeat sequences of MERVL, and is translated into an elongated chimeric protein (PRMT6MT2B2) whose function differs from that of the canonical PRMT6 protein (PRMT6CAN) in mouse preimplantation embryos. Overexpression of PRMT6CAN in fibroblast cells increased asymmetric dimethylation of the third arginine residue of both histone H2A (H2AR3me2a) and histone H4 (H4R3me2a), while overexpression of PRMT6MT2B2 increased only H2AR3me2a. In addition, overexpression of PRMT6MT2B2 in one blastomere of mouse two-cell embryos promoted cell proliferation and differentiation of the blastomere into epiblast cells at the blastocyst stage, while overexpression of PRMT6CAN repressed cell proliferation. This is the first report of the translation of a chimeric protein (PRMT6MT2B2) in mouse preimplantation embryos. Our results suggest that analyzing chimeric transcripts with MERVL will provide insight into the relationship between zygotic genome activation and subsequent intra- and extra-cellular lineage determination.",
