    "abstract": "The common soil bacteria Serratia marcescens, Serratia proteamaculans, and Bacillus subtilis produce small molecular weight volatile compounds that are fungi-static against multiple species, including the zygomycete mold Rhizopus stolonifer (Mucoromycota) and the model filamentous mold Neurospora crassa (Ascomycota). The compounds or the bacteria can be exploited in development of biological controls to prevent establishment of fungi on food and surfaces. Here, we quantified and identified bacteria-produced volatiles using headspace sampling and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that each bacterial species in culture has a unique volatile profile consisting of dozens of compounds. Using multivariate statistical approaches, we identified compounds in common or unique to each species. Our analysis suggested that three compounds, dimethyl trisulfide, anisole, and 2-undecanone, are characteristic of the volatiles emitted by these antagonistic bacteria. We developed bioassays for testing inhibition of each compound and found dimethyl trisulfide and anisole were the most potent. This work establishes a pipeline for translating volatile profiles of cultured bacteria into high quality candidate fungistatic compounds which may be useful in combination as antifungal control products.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacteria may benefit by producing fungistatic volatiles that limit fungal growth providing a mechanism to exclude competitors for resources. Volatile production is potentially mediating long distance biological control and competitive in-teractions among microbes, but the specific bioactive compounds are poorly characterized. This work provides evidence that fungistatic compounds in complex blends can be identified using machine-learning and multivariate approaches. This is the first step in identifying pathways responsible for fungistatic volatile production in order to phenotype and select natural strains for biocontrol ability, or engineer bacteria with relevant pathways.",

    "abstract": "The karyotype, or number and arrangement of chromosomes, has varying levels of stability across both evolution and disease. Karyotype changes often originate from DNA breaks near the centromeres of chromosomes, which generally contain long arrays of tandem repeats or satellite DNA. Drosophila virilis possesses among the highest relative satellite abundances of studied species, with almost half its genome composed of three related 7bp satellites. We discovered a strain of D. virilis that we infer recently underwent three independent chromosome fusion events involving the X and Y chromosomes, in addition to one subsequent fission event. Here we isolate, characterize and propose a timeline for the chromosome fusions in this strain which we believe demonstrates a remarkable karyotype instability. We discovered that one of the substrains with an X-autosome fusion has a X-to-Y chromosome nondisjunction rate 20x higher than the D. virilis reference strain (21% vs. 1%). Finally, we found an overall higher rate of DNA breakage in the substrain with higher satellite DNA compared to a genetically similar substrain with less satellite DNA. This suggests satellite DNA abundance may play a role in the risk of genome instability. Overall, we introduce a novel system consisting of a single strain with four different karyotypes, which we believe will be useful for future studies of genome instability, centromere function, and sex chromosome evolution.",

    "abstract": "The management of future pandemic risk requires a better understanding of the mechanisms that determine the virulence of emerging zoonotic viruses. Meta-analyses suggest that the virulence of emerging zoonoses is correlated with but not completely predictable from reservoir host phylogeny, indicating that specific characteristics of reservoir host immunology and life history may drive the evolution of viral traits responsible for cross-species virulence. In particular, bats host viruses that cause higher case fatality rates upon spillover to humans than those derived from any other mammal, a phenomenon that cannot be explained by phylogenetic distance alone. In order to disentangle the fundamental drivers of these patterns, we develop a nested modeling framework that highlights mechanisms which underpin the evolution of viral traits in reservoir hosts that cause virulence following cross-species emergence. We apply this framework to generate virulence predictions for viral zoonoses derived from diverse mammalian reservoirs, successfully recapturing corresponding virus-induced human mortality rates reported in the literature. Notably, our work offers a mechanistic explanation for the extreme virulence of bat-borne zoonoses and, more generally, demonstrates how key differences in reservoir host longevity, viral tolerance, and constitutive immunity impact the evolution of viral traits that cause virulence following spillover to humans. Our theoretical framework offers a series of testable questions and hypotheses designed to stimulate future work comparing cross-species virulence evolution in zoonotic viruses derived from diverse mammalian hosts.",

Together with spatial transcriptome on embryonic sections, we characterized the molecule and spatial architecture of previously unappreciated cell types. Combined with data from other vertebrates, the rich information shed light on spatial patterning of axes, systemic temporal regulation of developmental progression and potential human-specific regulation.

    "abstract": "Proprioception is one of the least understood senses, yet fundamental for the control of movement. Even basic questions of how limb pose is represented in the somatosensory cortex are unclear. We developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topo-VAE) to compute a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data. Although not fitted to neural data, our model reproduces two sets of observations from monkey centre-out reaching: 1. The shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates despite the model having no knowledge of arm kinematics or hand coordinate systems. 2. The distribution of neuronal preferred directions (PDs) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. The model makes several testable predictions: 1. Encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry PDs. 2. Few neurons will encode just a single joint. Topo-VAE provides a principled basis for understanding of sensorimotor representations, and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots.",

    "abstract": "Responsible for the conversion of L-tyrosine to p-coumaric acid in Flavobacterium johnsoniae, FjTAL has drawn the attention of many biochemical engineers who wish to carry out a sustainable biosynthetic scheme for the production of aromatic compounds. In this study, with the aid of various computational tools, the secondary and tertiary structures of FjTAL have been predicted. The results suggest that FjTAL forms a homo-tetramer when active as a cytosolic enzyme and it is mostly consisted of alpha helices. With the aid of molecular docking, one can hypothesize that FjTAL is likely to bind to L-tyrosine, p-coumaric acid, and caffeic acid with a similar molecular mechanism and thus, p-coumaric acid and caffeic acid may exhibit a negative feedback response toward the enzyme and inhibit its activity competitively. Two distinct binding pockets have been discovered, one of which contains highly conserved residues among several species. The residues which form the prosthetic group 3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO) also emerge in the evolutionary conserved binding pocket. The other discovered cavity, could either be a second binding site for the ligands or simply an artifact of the molecular docking task.",

Several factors, including environmental ones, are predicted to restrict HGT, but we lack systematic and experimental data supporting these predictions. Here, we address this gap by measuring the relative fitness of genes horizontally transferred from E. coli to S. enterica in infection relevant environments. We estimated the distribution of fitness effects in each environment and identified dosage-dependent effects across different environments are a significant barrier to HGT. The majority of genes were found to be deleterious. We also found longer genes had stronger negative fitness consequences than shorter ones, showing that gene length can significantly hinder HGT. Furthermore, fitness effects of transferred genes were found to be environmentally dependent. In summary, a substantial fraction of transferred genes had a significant fitness cost on the recipient, with both gene characteristics and the environment acting as evolutionary barriers to HGT.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity monitoring in conservation projects is essential to understand environmental status and recovery. However, traditional field surveys can be expensive, time-consuming, biased towards visual detection, and focused on measuring a limited set of taxa. Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods provide a new approach to biodiversity monitoring that has the potential to sample a taxonomically broader set of organisms with similar effort, but many of these approaches are still in the early stages of development and testing. Here, we use multilocus eDNA metabarcoding to understand how the removal of invasive red swamp crayfish impacts local biodiversity of a desert oasis ecosystem, as well as to detect crayfish both directly and indirectly. We tracked crayfish DNA signatures, microbial DNA associated with crayfish, and biodiversity of plant, fungal, animal, and bacterial communities through time. We were unsuccessful in detecting crayfish directly in either control tanks or oases using targeted metabarcoding primers for invertebrates and eukaryotes, similar to previous studies which have shown variable levels of success in detecting crayfish from environmental samples. However, we were successful in discerning a suite of 90 crayfish-associated taxa to serve as candidate bioindicators of invasive presence using 16S and Fungal ITS2 metabarcoding. Ranking these 90 taxa by their geographic distribution in eDNA surveys and by evidence of crayfish-associations in the literature, we support 9 taxa to be high-ranking, and suggest they be prioritized in future biomonitoring. Biodiversity analyses from five metabarcode loci including plants, animals, and both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes showed that communities differed but that species richness remained relatively similar between oases through time. Our results reveal that, while there are limitations of eDNA approaches to detect crayfish and other invasive species, microbial bioindicators offer a largely untapped biomonitoring opportunity for invasive species management, adding a valuable resource to a conservation managers toolkit.",

DNA origami offers precise nanoscale spacing of ligands, a potentially useful feature for therapeutic nanoparticles. Here we introduce a \"square block\" DNA origami platform to explore the importance of spacing of CpG oligonucleotides, which engage Toll-like receptors and thereby act as danger signals for dendritic cells. Through in vitro cell-culture studies and in vivo tumor-treatment models, we demonstrate that square blocks induce Th1 immune polarization when CpG is spaced at 3.5 nm. We observe that this DNA origami vaccine enhances DC activation, antigen cross-presentation, CD8 T cell activation, Th1-polarized CD4 activation and NK cell activation. The vaccine also synergizes effectively with anti-PD-L1 for improved cancer immunotherapy in melanoma and lymphoma models and induces long-term T cell memory.

    "abstract": "Interactions between fibroblasts and immune cells play an important role in tissue inflammation. Previous studies have found that eosinophils activated with interleukin-3 (IL-3) degranulate on aggregated immunoglobulin G (IgG) and release mediators that activate fibroblasts in the lung. However, these studies were done with eosinophil-conditioned media that have the capacity to investigate only one-way signaling from eosinophils to fibroblasts. Here, we demonstrate a coculture model of primary normal human lung fibroblasts (HLFs) and human blood eosinophils from patients with allergy and asthma using an open microfluidic coculture device. In our device, the two types of cells can communicate via two-way soluble factor signaling in the shared media while being physically separated by a half wall. Initially, we assessed the level of eosinophil degranulation by their release of eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN). Next, we analyzed the inflammation-associated genes and soluble factors using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and multiplex immunoassays, respectively. Our results suggest an induction of a proinflammatory fibroblast phenotype of HLFs following the coculture with degranulating eosinophils, validating our previous findings. Additionally, we present a new result that indicate potential impacts of activated HLFs back on eosinophils. This open microfluidic coculture platform provides unique opportunities to investigate the intercellular signaling between the two cell types and their roles in airway inflammation and remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Cortical function emerges from the interactions of multi-scale networks that may be studied at a high level using neural mass models (NMM), representing the mean activity of large numbers of neurons. In order to properly reproduce experimental data, these models require the addition of further elements. Here we provide a framework integrating conduction physics that can be used to simulate cortical electrophysiology measurements, particularly those obtained from multi-contact laminar electrodes. This is achieved by endowing NMMs with basic physical properties, such as the average laminar location of the apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cell populations. We call this framework laminar NMM, or LaNMM for short. We then employ this framework to infer the location of oscillatory generators from laminar-resolved data collected from the prefrontal cortex in the macaque monkey. Based on the literature on columnar connectivity, we define a minimal neural mass model capable of generating amplitude and phase coupled slow (alpha/beta, 4-22 Hz) and fast (gamma, 30-250 Hz) oscillations. The synapse layer locations of the two pyramidal cell populations are treated as optimization parameters, together with two more LaNMM-specific parameters, to compare the models with the multi-contact recordings. We rank the candidate models using an optimization function that evaluates the match between the functional connectivity (FC) of the model and data, where the FC is defined by the covariance between bipolar voltage measurements at different cortical depths. The family of best solutions reproduces the FC of the observed electrophysiology while selecting locations of pyramidal cells and their synapses that result in the generation of fast activity at superficial layers and slow activity across most depths, in line with recent literature proposals.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe provide a neural mass modeling formalism that includes a physical layer to simulate electrophysiology measurements.\nC_LIO_LITo analyze in-vivo data collected in the macaque monkey during a memory task, we propose a specific model with two coupled main circuits that can generate realistic electrophysiological signals in two important oscillatory regimes--the alpha/beta and the gamma bands.\nC_LIO_LIPhysical elements in the model shed light on the generation of oscillations in the two regimes and on the relative power distribution of fast and slow oscillatory signals across cortical depth, which we show can be altered by the choice of the reference location or method.\nC_LIO_LIThe model is contrasted with in-vivo data, with parameters adjusted by matching voltage statistics in the alpha/beta and gamma bands, leading to a solution with slow frequency components generated by synapses spanning most cortical layers and fast oscillations in superficial layers.\nC_LIO_LIThe resulting formalism provides useful tools and concepts to analyze and model data, with implications for understanding altered oscillatory EEG activity in dementia, Alzheimers disease and other disorders with oscillatory features.\nC_LI",

Both theory and simulations confirm that the shear stress follows the universal power law [Formula] for the brush bilayers with interpenetration and in the absence of the interpenetration, the shear stress scales linearly with the shear rate. It is also revealed that the presence of explicit solvent molecules prevents the brushes to form and interpenetration zone and therefore with explicit solvents the shear stress scales linearly with shear rate. Therefore, this study strongly confirms that there is no sublinear regime in the world of polymer brush bilayer, neither by solvents nor by hydrodynamic effects. As long as there is an interpenetration zone, the superlinear regime dominates and in the absence of the interpenetration zone the linear regime dominates. Therefore, polymer brushes are not a good candidate for lubrication and all works suggesting that this system is a super lubricant are completely wrong.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are microtubule-based organelles whose relatively simple shape makes them ideal for investigating the fundamental question of organelle size regulation. Most of the flagellar materials are transported from the cell body via an active transport process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). The rate of IFT entry into flagella, known as IFT injection, has been shown to negatively correlate with flagellar length. However, it remains unknown how the cell measures the length of its flagella and controls IFT injection. One of the most-discussed theoretical models for length sensing to control IFT is the ion-current model, which posits that there is a uniform distribution of Ca2+ channels along the flagellum and that the Ca2+ current from the flagellum into the cell body increases linearly with flagellar length. In this model, the cell uses the Ca2+ current to negatively regulate IFT injection. The recent discovery that IFT entry into flagella is regulated by the phosphorylation of kinesin through a calcium-dependent protein kinase has provided further impetus for the ion-current model. To test this model, we measured and manipulated the levels of Ca2+ inside of Chlamydomonas flagella and quantified IFT injection. Although the concentration of Ca2+ inside of flagella was weakly correlated with the length of flagella, we found that IFT injection was reduced in calcium-deficient flagella, rather than increased as the model predicted, and that variation in IFT injection was uncorrelated with the occurrence of flagellar Ca2+ spikes. Thus, Ca2+ does not appear to function as a negative regulator of IFT injection, hence it cannot form the basis of a stable length control system.",

    "abstract": "The breathing motions of proteins are thought to play a critical role in function. However, current techniques to study key collective motions are limited to spectroscopy and computation. We present a high-resolution experimental approach based on the total scattering from protein crystals at room temperature (TS/RT-MX) that captures both structure and collective motions. To reveal the scattering signal from protein motions, we developed a general workflow that enables robust subtraction of lattice disorder. The workflow introduces two new methods: GOODVIBES, a detailed and refinable lattice disorder model based on the rigid-body vibrations of a crystalline elastic network; and DISCOBALL, an independent method of validation that estimates the displacement covariance between proteins in the lattice in real space. We demonstrate the robustness of this workflow and further demonstrate how it can be interfaced with MD simulations towards obtaining high-resolution insight into functionally important protein motions.",

    "abstract": "Human exposure to toxic chemicals presents a huge health burden and disease risk. Key to understanding chemical toxicity is knowledge of the molecular target(s) of the chemicals. Because a comprehensive safety assessment for all chemicals is infeasible due to limited resources, a robust computational method for discovering targets of environmental exposures is a promising direction for public health research. In this study, we implemented a novel matrix completion algorithm named coupled matrix-matrix completion (CMMC) for predicting exposome-target interactions, which exploits the vast amount of accumulated data regarding chemical exposures and their molecular targets. Our approach achieved an AUC of 0.89 on a benchmark dataset generated using data from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database. Our case study with bisphenol A (BPA) and its analogues shows that CMMC can be used to accurately predict molecular targets of novel chemicals without any prior bioactivity knowledge. Overall, our results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of computational predicting environmental chemical-target interactions to efficiently prioritize chemicals for further study.",

    "abstract": "Innovation in ecological restoration is necessary in order to achieve the ambitious targets established in United Nations conventions and other global restoration initiatives. Innovation is also crucial for navigating uncertainties in repairing and restoring ecosystems, and thus practitioners often develop innovations at project design and implementation stages. However, innovation in ecological restoration can be hindered by many factors (e.g., time and budget constraints, project complexity, and others). Theory and research on innovation has been formally applied in many fields, yet explicit study of innovation in ecological restoration remains nascent. In order to assess the use of innovation in restoration projects, including its drivers and inhibitors, we conducted a social survey of restoration practitioners in the United States. Specifically, we assessed relationships between project-based innovation and traits of: the individual practitioner (including, for example, age, gender, experience); company (including, for example, company size and companys inclusion of social goals); project (including, for example, complexity and uncertainty); and project outcomes (such as completing the project on time/on budget and personal satisfaction with the work). We found positive relationships between project-based innovation and practitioner traits (age, gender, experience, engagement with research scientists), one company trait (companys inclusion of social goals in their portfolio), and project traits (project complexity and length). In contrast, two practitioner traits, risk aversion and the use of industry-specific information, were negatively related to project-based innovation. Satisfaction with work outcomes was positively correlated with project-based innovation. Collectively, the results provide insights into the drivers and inhibitors of innovation in restoration and suggest opportunities for research and application.",

    "abstract": "Stimulus and location specificity are long considered hallmarks of visual perceptual learning. This renders visual perceptual learning distinct from other forms of learning, where generalization can be more easily attained, and unsuitable for practical applications, where generalization is key. Based on hypotheses derived from the structure of the visual system, we test here whether stimulus variability can unlock generalization in perceptual learning. We train subjects in orientation discrimination, while we vary the amount of variability in a task-irrelevant feature, spatial frequency. We find that independently of task difficulty, this manipulation enables generalization of learning to new stimuli and locations, while not negatively affecting the overall amount of learning on the task. We then use deep neural networks to investigate how variability unlocks generalization. We find that networks develop invariance to the task-irrelevant feature when trained with variable inputs. The degree of learned invariance strongly predicts generalization. A reliance on invariant representations can explain variability-induced generalization in visual perceptual learning, suggests new targets for understanding the neural basis of perceptual learning in high-order visual cortex, and presents an easy to implement modification of common training paradigms that may benefit practical applications.",

Metagenomics and total RNA sequencing (total RNA-Seq) are target-PCR-free HTS methods that are used to characterize microbial communities and simultaneously reconstruct SSU rRNA sequences. However, more testing is required to determine and improve their effectiveness. In this study, we processed metagenomics and total RNA-Seq data retrieved from a commercially available mock microbial community using 112 combinations of commonly used data-processing tools, determined SSU rRNA reconstruction completeness of both sequencing methods for each species in the mock community, and analyzed the impact of data-processing tools on SSU rRNA and genome completeness. Total RNA-Seq allowed for the complete or near-complete reconstruction of all mock community SSU rRNA sequences and outperformed metagenomics. SSU rRNA completeness of metagenomics strongly correlated with the genome size of mock community species. The impact of data-processing tools was overall low, although certain tools resulted in significantly lower SSU rRNA completeness. These results are promising for the high-throughput reconstruction of novel full-length SSU rRNA sequences and could advance the simultaneous application of multiple -omics approaches in routine environmental assessments to allow for more holistic assessments of ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Choanoflagellates, the closest living relatives of animals, express diverse animal genes and may thereby provide insights into the ancestral roles of genes essential for modern animal cell biology and development. While efforts to study conserved gene families in choanoflagellates have been constrained by the relative inefficiency of currently available genetic tools, small molecule approaches are readily available and may provide a complementary and scalable approach for studying protein function. To study the physiological roles of choanoflagellate kinases, including animal kinase homologs, we established a high-throughput platform to screen the model choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta with a curated library of human kinase inhibitors. We identified 36 diverse kinase inhibitors that disrupt S. rosetta cell proliferation. By exploring structure-activity relationships of one inhibitor, sorafenib, we identified a p38 kinase as a stress-activated regulator of cell proliferation in S. rosetta. This finding indicates a conserved p38 function between choanoflagellates, animals and fungi. Moreover, this study demonstrates that existing kinase inhibitors can serve as powerful tools to examine the ancestral roles of kinases that regulate modern animal development.\n\nSignificance StatementChoanoflagellates are the closest living relatives of animals and are useful models for studying the ancestral functions of animal gene families, including kinases. In this study, we treated choanoflagellates with a library of small molecules to determine if currently available human kinase inhibitors could reveal choanoflagellate kinase function. This approach highlighted the essentiality of a specific kinase that is conserved between animals and choanoflagellates and provides tractable options for investigating protein functions in other emerging model systems with limited genetic tools.",

In this study, we engineered Escherichia coli to overexpress its native NikABCDE transporter and a heterologous metallothionein to capture nickel at concentrations in local effluent streams. We found the engineered strain had a 7-fold improvement in the bioaccumulation performance for nickel compared to controls, but also observed a drastic decrease in cell viability due to metabolic burden or inducer (IPTG) toxicity.

    "abstract": "Improved treatment strategies for sarcoma rely on clarification of the molecular mediators of disease progression. Recently, we reported that the secreted glycoprotein NELL-1 modulates osteosarcoma (OS) disease progression in part via altering the sarcomatous extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell-ECM interactions. Of known NELL-1 interactor proteins, Contactin-associated protein-like 4 (Cntnap4) encodes a member of the neurexin superfamily of transmembrane molecules best known for its presynaptic functions in the central nervous system. Here, CRISPR/Cas9 gene deletion of CNTNAP4 reduced OS tumor growth, sarcoma-associated angiogenesis, and pulmonary metastases. CNTNAP4 knockout (KO) in OS tumor cells largely phenocopied the effects of NELL-1 KO, including reductions in sarcoma cell attachment, migration, and invasion. Further, CNTNAP4 KO cells were found to be unresponsive to the effects of NELL-1 treatment. Transcriptomic analysis combined with protein phospho-array demonstrated notable reductions in the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade with CNTNAP4 deletion, and the ERK1/2 agonist isoproterenol restored cell functions among CNTNAP4 KO tumor cells. Finally, human primary cells and tissues in combination with sequencing datasets confirmed the significance of CNTNAP4 signaling in human sarcomas. In summary, our findings demonstrate the biological importance of NELL-1/CNTNAP4 signaling axis in disease progression of human sarcomas and suggest that targeting the NELL-1/CNTNAP4 signaling pathway represents a strategy with potential therapeutic benefit in sarcoma patients.",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTLs) are key players of adaptive anti-tumor immunity based on their ability to specifically recognize and destroy tumor cells. Many cancer immunotherapies rely on unleashing CTL function. However, tumors can evade killing through strategies which are not yet fully elucidated. To provide deeper insight into tumor evasion mechanisms in an antigen-dependent manner, we established a human co-culture system composed of tumor and primary immune cells. Using this system, we systematically investigated intrinsic regulators of tumor resistance by conducting a complementary CRISPR screen approach. By harnessing CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) and CRISPR knockout (KO) technology in parallel, we investigated gene gain-of-function as well as loss-of-function across genes with annotated function. CRISPRa and CRISPR KO screens uncovered 186 and 704 hits respectively, with 60 gene hits overlapping between both. These data confirmed the role of interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}), tumor necrosis factor  (TNF-) and autophagy pathways and uncovered new genes implicated in tumor resistance to killing. Notably, we discovered that ILKAP encoding the integrin-linked kinase-associated serine/threonine phosphatase 2C, a gene previously unknown to play a role in antigen specific CTL-mediated killing, mediate tumor resistance independently from regulating antigen presentation, IFN-{gamma} or TNF- responsiveness. Moreover, our work describes the contrasting role of soluble and membrane-bound ICAM-1 in regulating tumor cell killing. The deficiency of membrane-bound ICAM-1 (mICAM-1) or the overexpression of soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) induced resistance to CTL killing, whereas PD-L1 overexpression had no impact. These results highlight the essential role of ICAM-1 at the immunological synapse between tumor and CTL and the antagonist function of sICAM-1.",

    "abstract": "hERG1 conducts cardiac IKr and is critical for repolarization of the human heart. Reduced IKr causes long QT syndrome and increases the risk for cardiac arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. At least two subunits combine to form functional hERG1 channels, hERG1a and hERG1b. Changes in hERG 1a/1b subunit abundance modulates IKr kinetics, magnitude, and drug sensitivity. Studies from native cardiac tissue have suggested that hERG1 subunit abundance is dynamically regulated, but the impact of altered subunit abundance on IKr and its response to external stressors is not well understood. Here, we used a substrate-driven hiPSC-CM maturation model to investigate how changes in relative hERG 1a/1b subunit abundance impact the response of native IKr to extracellular acidosis, a known component of ischemic heart disease and sudden infant death syndrome. IKr recorded from immature hiPSC-CMs display a two-fold greater inhibition by extracellular acidosis (pH 6.3) compared to matured hiPSC-CMs. qRT-PCR and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that hERG1a subunit mRNA and protein were upregulated, and hERG1b subunit mRNA and protein were downregulated in matured hiPSC-CMs compared to immature hiPSC-CMs. The shift in subunit abundance in matured hiPSC-CMs was accompanied by an increased in IKr density. Silencing the impact of hERG1b on native IKr kinetics by overexpressing a polypeptide identical to the hERG1a PAS domain reduced the magnitude of IKr proton inhibition in immature hiPSC-CMs to levels comparable to those observed in matured hiPSC-CMs. These data demonstrate that hERG1 subunit abundance is dynamically regulated and that hERG1 subunit abundance determines IKr sensitivity to protons in hiPSC-CMs.",

We demonstrated efficient multiplex editing with one single gRNA in 42 transgenic lines. The mutation profiles ranged from small indels and local deletions in individual genes to large genomic dropouts and rearrangements spanning tandem genes. We also detected complex rearrangements including translocations and inversions resulting from multiple cleavage and repair events. Target capture sequencing was instrumental for unbiased assessments of repair outcomes to reconstruct unusual mutant alleles.

    "abstract": "Asymmetric cell division generates new cell types and is a feature of development in multicellular organisms. Prior to asymmetric cell division, cell polarity is established. Zea mays stomatal development serves as an excellent plant model system for asymmetric cell division, especially the asymmetric division of the subsidiary mother cell (SMC). In SMCs, the nucleus migrates to a polar location after the accumulation of polarly localized proteins, but before the appearance of the preprophase band. We examined a mutant of the outer nuclear membrane protein, which is part of the LINC (linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton) complex that localizes to the nuclear envelope in interphase cells. Previously, mlks2 (maize linc kash sine-like2) was observed to have abnormal stomata. We confirmed and identified the precise defects that lead to abnormal asymmetric divisions. Proteins that are polarly localized in SMCs prior to division polarize normally in mlks2. However, polar localization of the nucleus is sometimes impaired, even in cells that have otherwise normal polarity. This leads to a misplaced preprophase band and atypical division planes. MLKS2 is localized to mitotic structures, however the structure of the preprophase band, spindle and phragmoplast appeared normal in mlks2. Timelapse imaging revealed that mlks2 has defects in pre-mitotic nuclear migration towards the polarized site, and unstable position at the division site after formation of the preprophase band. We show that nuclear envelope proteins promote pre-mitotic nuclear migration and stable nuclear position, and that the position of the nucleus influences division plane establishment in asymmetrically dividing cells.\n\nOne-sentence summaryNuclear movement and positioning prior to asymmetric cell division is required for deciding the future division site.",

    "abstract": "Speaking is not only about retrieving words and structuring them into sentences, but it also requires top-down control to plan and execute speech. In previous electrophysiological research with young-adult speakers, mid-frontal theta oscillations have been observed using a picture-word interference paradigm. With this paradigm, participants name pictures while ignoring superimposed distractor words. In particular, mid-frontal theta power increases for categorically related distractors relative to other types of distractors, reflecting the top-down interference control in resolving the competition between processing streams during word production (Piai, Roelofs, Jensen, Schoffelen, & Bonnefond, 2014). In the present study, we conceptually replicated the magnetoencephalography study by Piai et al. (2014) with an older group of healthy adults (mean age of 60 years). Behaviorally, we replicated distractor semantic interference and Stroop-like interference effects usually observed in young adults. However, we did not find the corresponding theta modulation associated with these interference effects on the neural level. Instead, we found beta power decreases for both effects, mostly pronounced in the left posterior temporal and inferior parietal cortex. The distinct spectro-spatial-temporal profile of the oscillatory effects in the older population suggests different underlying dynamics relative to the midline frontal effect previously found in young-adult speakers. Our results indicate that the neural underpinnings of top-down interference control may be modified by aging, and that the mid-frontal theta cannot be the exclusive mechanism enabling interference control during spoken word production.",

While infected activated CD4+ T cells are thought to be the principal source of HIV production, and reversion of activated infected cells to a resting state as the major pathway to establishment of the latently infected cell reservoir, we now show that in the earliest stages of detectable HIV infection in the lymphoid tissue reservoir, infection of resting CD4+ T cells establishes the first populations of both productively and latently infected cells. We further show that the early infection of resting T cells reflects their predominance in lymphoid tissues and the expression of pTEFb in vivo in resting T cells to support their infection. The immediate establishment of productively and latently infected cell populations enable HIV to propagate and persist, and generates reservoirs from which infection can rebound despite instituting ART at the earliest stage of detectable infection.",

    "abstract": "KEOPS is a multi-subunit protein complex conserved in eukaryotes and archaea. It is composed of Pcc1, Kae1, Bud32, Cgi121, and Gon7 in eukaryotes and is primarily involved in N6-threonylcarbamoyl adenosine (t6A) modification of tRNAs. Recently, KEOPS is reported to participate in homologous recombination repair in yeast. To characterize the KEOPS in archaea (aKEOPS), we conducted genetic and biochemical analyses of its encoding genes in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Saccharolobus islandicus. We show that aKEOPS also possesses five subunits, Pcc1, Kae1, Bud32, Cgi121, and Pcc1-like (or Gon7-like), just as eukaryotic KEOPS. Pcc1-like has physical interactions with Kae1 and Pcc1 and can mediate the monomerization of the dimeric subcomplex (Kae1-Pcc1-Pcc1-Kae1), suggesting that Pcc1-like is a functional homolog of the eukaryotic Gon7 subunit. Strikingly, none of the genes encoding aKEOPS subunits, including Pcc1 and Pcc1-like, can be deleted in the wild type and in a t6A modification complementary strain named TsaKI, implying that aKEOPS complex is essential for an additional cellular process in this archaeon. Knock-down of the Cgi121 subunit leads to severe growth retardance in the wild type which is partially rescued in TsaKI. These results suggest that aKEOPS plays an essential role independent of cellular t6A modification level. In addition, archaeal Cgi121 possesses dsDNA-binding activity which relies on its tRNA 3 CCA tail binding module. Our study clarifies the subunit organization of archaeal KEOPS and suggests of an origin of eukaryotic Gon7. The study also reveals a possible link between the function in t6A modification and the additional function presumably homologous recombination.",

While activators have been extensively characterized, repressors are less well studied and their repressive domains (RDs) are typically unknown, as are the RDs properties and the co-repressors (CoRs) they recruit. Here, we develop the high-throughput next-generation-sequencing-based method Repressive-Domain (RD)-seq to systematically identify RDs in complex libraries. Screening more than 200,000 fragments covering the coding sequences of all transcription-related proteins in Drosophila melanogaster, we identify 195 RDs in known repressors and in proteins not previously associated with repression. Many RDs contain recurrent short peptide motifs that are required for RD function, as demonstrated by motif mutagenesis, and are conserved between fly and human. Moreover, we show that RDs which contain one of five distinct repressive motifs interact with and depend on different CoRs, including Groucho, CtBP, Sin3A or Smrter. Overall, our work constitutes an invaluable resource and advances our understanding of repressors, their sequences, and the functional impact of sequence-altering mutations.",

    "abstract": "Ferroportin (FPN), the only identified eukaryotic iron efflux channel, plays an important role in iron homeostasis and is down regulated in many cancers. To determine if iron related pathways are important for HNSCC progression and proliferation, we utilize a model of FPN over-expression to simulate iron depletion and probe associated molecular pathways. HNSCC cells are sensitive to iron chelation and ferroptosis, but a non-transformed normal oral keratinocyte (NOK) cell line is not. We found that FPN expression inhibits HNSCC cell proliferation and colony formation but NOK cells are unaffected. Inhibition of cell proliferation is rescued by the addition hepcidin. Decreases in proliferation are due to the disruption of iron homeostasis via loss of labile iron caused by elevated FPN levels. This in turn protects HNSCC cells from ferroptotic cell death. Expression of FPN induces DNA damage, activates p21 and reduces mRNA levels of cyclin proteins thereby inhibiting cell cycle progression of HNSCC cells, arresting cells in S-phase. Induction of FPN severely inhibits Edu incorporation and increases {beta}-galactosidase activity, indicating cells have entered senescence. Finally, in an oral orthotopic mouse xenograft model, FPN induction yields a decrease of tumor growth. Our results indicate that iron plays a role in HNSCC cell proliferation and sustained growth and ferroptosis iron based therapeutic strategies may have potential therapeutic benefit.",

SHP2is block proliferation of RTK- or cycling RAS mutant-driven cancers and overcome adaptive resistance to other RAS-ERK pathway drugs. Several SHP2is are in clinical trials. To identify potential SHP2i resistance mechanisms, we performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens on two SHP2i-sensitive AML cell lines and recovered genes expected to cause resistance, including tumor suppressor (NF1, PTEN, CDKN1B) and \"RASopathy\" (LZTR1, RASA2) genes, and several novel targets (INPPL1, MAP4K5, epigenetic modifiers). We then screened 14 cancer lines with a focused CRISPR library targeting common \"hits\" from the genome-wide screens. LZTR1 deletion conferred resistance in 12/14 lines, followed by MAP4K5 (8/14), SPRED2 (6/14), STK40 (6/14), and INPPL1 (5/14). INPPL1, MAP4K5, or LZTR1 deletion reactivated ERK signaling. INPPL1-mediated sensitization to SHP2i required its NPXY motif but not its lipid phosphatase domain. MAP4K5 acted upstream of MEK via a kinase-dependent target(s), whereas LZTR1 showed cell-dependent effects on RIT and RAS stability. INPPLI, MAP4K5, or LZTR1 deletion also conferred SHP2i resistance in mice. Our results reveal multiple SHP2i resistance genes, emphasizing the need for detailed understanding of the resistance landscape to arrive at effective combinations.",

Greasy spot is the most prevalent fungal disease in sweet orange in Panama. Nevertheless, no epidemiological information is available. In this study, the dynamics of the defoliation, inoculum production, airborne inoculum, and infection periods of Z. citri-griseum and their associations with environmental conditions were determined in Panama. The period from December to April was characterized by greater defoliation of trees, with the greatest amount of leaf litter being produced in January and February. The number of days until total leaf decomposition (DLD) was related to the number of rainy days >1mm (NRD), accumulated rainfall (AR), and average relative humidity (ARH). The number of ascospores released from leaf litter (ASCL) was related to DLD, NRD, AR, and average temperature (AT). The greatest amounts of airborne ascospores (AASC) of Z. citri-griseum occur during April and May, when the rainy season begins in Panama. Similarly, the highest incidence (INC) of greasy spot in the trap plants coincided with the months of the greatest availability of airborne ascospores. However, infections were also recorded during other times of the year. The AASC or INC data were fitted to Bayesian models including meteorological variables and an autoregressive temporal component, the latter being the most influential. The results obtained in this study will allow the development of more efficient and sustainable fungicide programs for greasy spot control in Panama.",

    "abstract": "Previous work has proposed two potentials benefits of retrospective attention on working memory (WM): target strengthening and non-target inhibition. It remains unknown which hypothesis contributes to the improved WM performance, yet the neural mechanisms responsible for this attentional benefit are unclear. Here, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals while 33 participants performed a retrospective-cue WM task. Multivariate pattern classification analysis revealed that only representations of target features were enhanced by valid retrospective attention during the retention, supporting the target strengthening hypothesis. Further univariate analysis found that mid-frontal theta inter-trial phase coherence (ITPC) and ERP components were modulated by valid retrospective attention and correlated with individual differences and moment-to-moment fluctuations on behavioral outcomes, suggesting that both trait- and state-level variability in attentional preparatory processes influence goal-directed behavior. Furthermore, task-irrelevant target spatial location could be decoded from EEG signals, indicating that enhanced spatial binding of target representation promotes high WM precision. Importantly, frontoparietal theta-alpha phase-amplitude-coupling was increased by valid retrospective attention and predicted the reduced randomly guessing rates. This long-range connection supported top-down information flow in engagement of frontoparietal networks, which might organize attentional states to integrate target features. Altogether, these results provide neurophysiological bases that retrospective attention improves WM precision through enhancing representation of target and emphasize the critical role of frontoparietal attentional network in the control of WM representations.",

This metabolic dissimilarity results in distinct small intestinal immune responses during protist colonization. Metabolic differences between Tritrichomonas species also determine their ecological niche within the microbiota. By manipulating dietary fibers and developing in vitro protist culture, we show that different parabasalid species preferentially rely on dietary polysaccharides or mucus glycans. These polysaccharide preferences create trans-kingdom competition with specific commensal bacteria, which affects intestinal immunity in a diet-dependent manner. Our findings reveal unappreciated diversity in commensal parabasalids, elucidate differences in commensal protist metabolism, and suggest how dietary interventions could regulate their impact on gut health.",

    "abstract": "Holocene-era range expansions are relevant to understanding how a species might respond to the warming and drying climates of today. The harsh conditions of North American deserts have phylogenetically structured desert bat communities but differences in flight capabilities are expected to affect their ability to compete, locate, and use habitat in the face of modern climate change. A highly vagile but data-deficient bat species, the spotted bat (Euderma maculatum) is thought to have expanded its range from central Mexico to western Canada during the Holocene. With specimens spanning this latitudinal extent, we coupled phylogeography (mtDNA) with ecological niche modeling (ENM) to investigate the Holocene biogeography from the rear to leading edges. The ENM and phylogeny supported a Holocene range expansion from Mexico with increased expansion throughout the intermountain west within the last 6 kya. Long-term isolation at the southern-most margin of the range suggests one or more populations were left behind as climate space contracted and are currently of unknown status. The species appears historically suited to track shifts in climate space but differences in flight behaviors between leading edge and core-range lineages suggest that range expansions could be influenced by differences in habitat quality or climate (e.g., drought). Although its vagility could facilitate the tracking of environmental change and thereby extinction avoidance, anthropogenic pressures at the core range could still threaten the ability for beneficial alleles to expand into the leading edge.",

    "abstract": "Although 3D genome architecture is essential for long-range gene regulation, the significance of distal regulatory chromatin contacts is challenged by recent findings of low correlation between contact propensity and gene expression. To better understand the role of long-range interactions between distal regulatory elements during the early transformation from healthy colon to colorectal cancer, here we performed high resolution chromatin conformation capture for 33 samples including non-neoplastic mucosa, adenomatous polyps and adenocarcinomas, mostly from Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) patients. We identified hundreds of thousands of chromatin micro-structures, such as architectural stripes and loops, which originated from active cis-regulatory elements. Surprisingly, these structures progressively decayed throughout cancer progression, particularly at promoters. Meta-analyses revealed that this decay was independent of alterations in DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility. Interestingly, the degree of interaction loss was poorly correlated with gene expression changes. Instead, genes whose expression were disproportionately lower and higher than their relative promoter interaction in mucosa shifted their expression in polyps and adenocarcinomas to yield a more direct relationship between strength of interaction and gene expression. Our work provides the first high resolution 3D conformation maps during early cancer formation and progression, and provides novel insights into transcriptional readouts associated with fine-scale chromatin conformation alterations.",

    "abstract": "During pollination, bees are exposed to a myriad of xenobiotics, including plant metabolites, which may exert a wide range of effects on their health. Although bees encode enzymes that help in the metabolism of xenobiotics, they still have reduced detoxification gene diversity when compared to other insects, and may rely on other components of their physiology, such as the microbiota, to degrade potentially toxic molecules. In this study, we show that amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside found in honey bee-pollinated almond trees, can be metabolized by both bees and members of the gut microbiota. In microbiota-deprived bees, amygdalin is degraded into prunasin, leading to prunasin accumulation in the midgut and hindgut. In microbiota-colonized bees, on the other hand, amygdalin is degraded even further, and prunasin does not accumulate in the gut, suggesting that the microbiota contribute to the full degradation of amygdalin into hydrogen cyanide. In vitro experiments demonstrated that amygdalin degradation by bee gut bacteria is strain-specific and not characteristic of a particular genus or species. We found strains of Bifidobacterium, Bombilactobacillus and Gilliamella that can degrade amygdalin, and the degradation mechanism appears to vary since only some strains produce prunasin as an intermediate. Finally, we investigated the basis of degradation in Bifidobacterium wkB204, a strain that fully degrades amygdalin. We found overexpression and secretion of several carbohydrate-degrading enzymes, including one in glycoside hydrolase family 3 (GH3). We expressed this GH3 in Escherichia coli and detected prunasin as a byproduct when cell lysates were cultured with amygdalin, supporting its contribution to amygdalin degradation. These findings demonstrate that both host and microbiota can act together to metabolize dietary plant metabolites. How amygdalin degradation into hydrogen cyanide affects bee health remains to be elucidated.",

    "abstract": "Drug-induced vascular injury (DIVI) observed in non-clinical species often leads to significant delays or termination of compounds in drug development due to the lack of translatable biomarkers and unknown relevance to humans. This study focused on the identification of potential biomarker candidates of drug-induced vascular injury, or more specifically mesenteric medial arterial necrosis (MAN), in rats. To do so, an adapted bioinformatic filtering pipeline was applied to previously generated gene expression data obtained from laser capture microdissected endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells and corresponding histopathological annotations from mesenteric arteries following treatment of rats with known vascular toxicants, non-vasotoxic vasoactive comparator compounds, and corresponding vehicle. A novel gene panel including 33 genes with consistent, specific, and dose-responsive dysregulation across multiple treatments inducing MAN was identified. The degree to which these reflect injury progression was characterized and changes were identified in samples from animals where injury was anticipated but not yet histologically observed. The most predictive candidates (AUC > 0.9) with the strongest changes (logFC > 1.7) in MAN encode secreted proteins (Tnc, Vcan, Timp1 and Fn1) which are strongly interlinked with each other and other potential candidate biomarkers encoding cell surface proteins. Although further validation is required for biomarker qualification, the adapted bioinformatic approach utilized in this study provides informed data-driven starting points for further DIVI biomarker discovery and development in rats, as well as potential mechanistic insight into MAN pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "SAMHD1 is a key regulator of dNTP metabolism, being activated by dGTP and converting dNTPs into their respective nucleosides. As a result, it plays a significant role in several distinct diseases. Not only is SAMHD1 a restriction factor for HIV-1 replication, which requires dNTPs for replication, but it is also required for genome stability, is mutated in multiple cancers, and loss of function mutations cause Acardi-Goutieres Syndrome, an early-onset inherited encephalopathy. In this paper we knock out the SAMHD1 gene in pluripotent stem cells, and show that it also affects nucleoside analogue sensitivity of dividing cells and deoxyguanosine toxicity in a cell cycle-independent manner. Comparing wild type and gene-edited macrophages, we also show that deoxyguanosine toxicity is associated with pro-inflammatory cell death, modifications in uric acid production and the formation of monosodium urate crystals within the macrophages. These novel features of the SAMHD1-/- phenotype provide unique insights into the aetiology of Acardi-Goutieres Syndrome, and have implications for certain chemotherapeutic agents.",

    "abstract": "The cattle tracing databases set up over the past decades in Europe have become major resources for representing demographic processes of livestock and assessing potential risk of infections spreading by trade. The herds registered in these databases are nodes of a network of commercial movements, which can be altered to lower the risk of disease transmission. In this study, we develop an algorithm aimed at reducing the number of infected animals and herds, by rewiring specific movements responsible for trade flows from high- to low-prevalence herds. The algorithm is coupled with a generic computational model describing infection spread within and between herds, based on data extracted from the French cattle movement tracing database (BDNI). This model is used to simulate a wide array of infections, with either a recent outbreak (epidemic) or an outbreak that occurred five years earlier (endemic), on which the performances of the rewiring algorithm are explored. Results highlight the effectiveness of rewiring in containing infections to a limited number of herds for all scenarios, but especially if the outbreak is recent and if the estimation of disease prevalence is frequent. Further analysis reveal that the key parameters of the algorithm affecting infection outcome vary with the infection parameters. Allowing any animal movement from high to low-prevalence herds reduces the effectiveness of the algorithm in epidemic settings, while frequent and fine-grained prevalence assessments improve the impact of the algorithm in endemic settings. According to our results, our approach focusing on a few commercial movements is expected to lead to substantial improvements in the control of a targeted disease, although changes in the network structure should be monitored for potential vulnerabilities to other diseases. Due to its generality, the developed rewiring algorithm could be applied to any network of controlled individual movements liable to spread disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEstimates of \"brain-predicted age\" quantify apparent brain age compared to normative trajectories of neuroimaging features. The brain age gap (BAG) between predicted and chronological age is elevated in symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD), but has not been well explored in preclinical AD. Prior studies have typically modeled BAG with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but more recently other modalities, including functional connectivity (FC) and multimodal MRI, have been explored.\n\nMethodsWe trained three models to predict age from FC, volumetric (Vol), or multimodal MRI (Vol+FC) in 390 control participants (18-89 years old). In independent samples of 144 older adult controls, 154 preclinical AD participants, and 154 cognitively impaired (CI; CDR > 0) participants, we tested relationships between BAG and AD biomarkers of amyloid, tau, and neurodegeneration, as well as a global cognitive composite.\n\nResultsAll models predicted age in the control training set, with the multimodal model outperforming the unimodal models. All three BAG estimates were significantly elevated in CI compared to controls. FC-BAG and Vol+FC-BAG were marginally reduced in preclinical AD participants compared to controls. In CI participants only, elevated Vol-BAG and Vol+FC-BAG were associated with more advanced AD pathology and lower cognitive performance.\n\nConclusionsBoth FC-BAG and Vol-BAG are elevated in CI participants. However, FC and volumetric MRI also capture complementary signals. Specifically, FC-BAG may capture a unique biphasic response to preclinical AD pathology, while Vol-BAG may capture pathological progression and cognitive decline in the symptomatic stage. A multimodal age-prediction model captures these modality-specific patterns, and further, improves sensitivity to healthy age differences.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the National Institutes of Health (P01-AG026276, P01-AG03991, P30-AG066444, 5-R01-AG052550, 5-R01-AG057680, 1-R01-AG067505, 1S10RR022984-01A1, U19-AG032438), the BrightFocus Foundation (A2022014F), and the Alzheimers Association (SG-20-690363-DIAN).",

In this study, we wanted to challenge infectious SARS-CoV-2 with two samples of copper surfaces and one plastic surface as control at different direct times contact. To evaluate and quantify virucidal activity of copper against SARS-CoV-2, two methods of experimental infection were performed, TCID50 and plaque assays on VeroE6 cells, showing significant inactivation of high titer of SARS-CoV-2 within minutes reaching 99.9 % of inactivation of infectivity on both copper surfaces.

In this study, we developed degenerate oligonucleotide primer MIG-seq (dpMIG-seq) as an effective polymorphism discovery method that allows for variation in the number of polymorphisms while retaining the advantages of MIG-seq, including independence from DNA quality. In dpMIG-seq, a proportion of the simple sequence repeats in the primer sequence of the first PCR in MIG-seq was changed to degenerate oligonucleotides to enable annealing to a wider range of sequences. In tests of several crop species other than wheat, the number of loci that could be sequenced using dpMIG-seq with a data volume of 0.3 gigabases (Gb) was increased compared with that sequenced using MIG-seq. In wheat, the number of polymorphisms obtained via dpMIG-seq was higher than that obtained via MIG-seq when a data volume of about [&ge;]2 Gb was obtained. In dpMIG-seq, different loci could be sequenced by changing the positions of the degenerate oligonucleotides. By applying dpMIG-seq, we constructed a linkage map consisting of 5,142 markers for the rice inter-subspecies F2 population, and we detected quantitative trait loci for heading date in the regions where known heading-related genes were located.

In induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived midbrain organoid models deficient for DJ1 activity, we find that lysosomal proteolysis is impaired, causing AGEs to accumulate, -synuclein (-syn) phosphorylation to increase, and proteins to aggregate. These processes are at least partly driven by astrocytes, as DJ1 loss reduces their capacity to provide metabolic support and triggers acquisition of a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Consistently, in co-cultures, we find that DJ1-expressing astrocytes are able to reverse the proteolysis deficits of DJ1 knockout midbrain neurons. In conclusion, astrocytes capacity to clear toxic damaged proteins is critical to preserve neuronal function and their dysfunction contributes to the neurodegeneration observed in PD.",

Thus, there is a need to continue the development of tools to further advance our efforts to combat these pathogens, including reverse genetics techniques.

However, production of Zika virus has been successful from CMV-promoter driven expression plasmids, which provides cost and time advantages.

An artificial intron was introduced in the nonstructural protein 1 segment of the viral genome to promote stability in bacteria. We found that rescued virus maintained similar replication kinetics in several cell lines commonly used in flavivirus research. Thus, we present a rapid and cost-effective method for producing DENV2 strain 16681 from plasmid DNA. This construct will be a useful platform for the continued development of anti-DENV therapeutics and vaccines.",

Global trade of agricultural goods contributes to the dispersal of pathogens reshaping their genetic makeup and providing opportunities for virulence gains. Understanding how pathogens surmount control strategies and cope with new climates is crucial to predicting the future impact of crop pathogens. Here, we address this by assembling a global thousand-genome panel of Zymoseptoria tritici, a major fungal pathogen of wheat reported in all production areas worldwide. We identify the global invasion routes and ongoing genetic exchange of the pathogen among wheat-growing regions. We find that the global expansion was accompanied by increased activity of transposable elements and weakened genomic defenses. Finally, we find significant standing variation for adaptation to new climates encountered during the global spread.

    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) are the leading platform for in vivo delivery of gene therapies, with several already approved for clinical use. However, the heterogeneity and structural complexity of these viral particles render them challenging targets to characterize. Orbitrap-based native mass spectrometry (MS) is a method capable of directly characterizing intact megadalton protein assemblies. Here we used such an approach to characterize four different preparations of rAAV8 (two empty and two filled) differing in both their transgene and relative capsid protein isoform (i.e. VP1, VP2 and VP3) content. Interestingly, in native MS measurements of these samples, we observe complicated, unusual, and dramatically different spectral appearances between the four rAAV preparations that cannot be rationalized or interpreted using conventional approaches (i.e. charge state deconvolution). By combining high-resolution native MS, single particle charge detection MS, and spectral simulations, we reveal that these unexpected features result from a combination of stochastic assembly-induced heterogeneity and divergent gas phase charging behaviour between the four rAAV preparations. Our results stress the often-neglected heterogeneity of rAAVs, but also highlight the pitfalls of standard high-resolution mass analysis for such particles. Finally, we show that charge detection MS and spectral simulations can be used to tackle these challenges.",

    "abstract": "Conformational sampling of complex biomolecules is an emerging frontier in drug discovery. Indeed, advances in lab-based structural biology and related computational approaches like AlphaFold have made great strides in obtaining static protein structures. However, biology is in constant motion and many important biological processes rely on conformationally-driven events. Unrestrained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations require that the simulated time be comparable to the real time of the biological processes of interest, rendering pure MD impractical for many drug design projects, where conformationally-driven biological events can take microseconds to milliseconds or longer. An alternative approach is to accelerate the sampling of specific motions by applying restraints, guided by insights about the underlying biological process of interest. A plethora of restraints exist to limit the size of conformational search space, although each has drawbacks when simulating complex biological motions. In this work, we introduce a new kind of restraint for molecular dynamics simulations (MD) that is particularly well suited for complex conformationallydriven biological events, such as protein-ligand binding, allosteric modulations, conformational signalling, and membrane permeability. The new restraint, which relies on a barrier function (the scaled reciprocal function) is particularly beneficial to MD, where hard-wall restraints are needed with zero tolerance to restraint violation. We have implemented this restraint within a hybrid sampling framework that combines metadynamics and extended-Lagrangian adaptive biasing force (meta-eABF). We use two particular examples to demonstrate the value of this approach: (1) quantification of the approach of E3-loaded ubiquitin to a protein of interest as part of the Cullin ring ligase and (2) membrane permeability of heterobi-functional degrader molecules with a large degree of conformational flexibility. Future work will involve extension to additional systems and benchmarking of this approach compared with other methods.",

Atherosclerosis is an important pathological basis of cardiovascular disease, and its early diagnosis is of great significance. Urine is more conducive in the accumulation and response of changes in the physiological state of the body and is not regulated by homeostasis mechanisms, so it is a good source of biomarkers in the early stage of disease. In this study, ApoE-/- mice were fed with a high-fat diet for 5 months. Urine samples from the experimental group and control group, which were C57BL/6 mice fed a normal diet, were collected at seven time points. Proteomic analysis was used for internalcontrol and intergroup control. Internal control results showed a significant difference in the urinary proteome before and after a 1-week high-fat diet, and several differential proteins have been reported to be associated with atherosclerosis or for use as candidate biomarkers. The results of the intergroup control indicated that the biological process enriched by the GO analysis of the differential proteins corresponded to the progression of atherosclerosis. Differences in chemical modifications of urinary proteins have also been reported to be associated with the disease. This study demonstrates that urinary proteomics has the potential to monitor changes in the body sensitively and provides the possibility of identifying early biomarkers of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "The conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks by cellulases to glucose is a critical step in biofuel production. {beta}-glucosidases catalyze the final step in cellulose breakdown, producing glucose, and is often the rate-limiting step in biomass hydrolysis. Rationally engineering previously characterized enzymes may be one strategy to increase catalytic activity and the efficiency of cellulose hydrolysis. The specific activity of most natural and engineered {beta}-glucosidase is higher on the artificial substrate p-Nitrophenyl {beta}-D-glucopyranoside (pNPGlc) than on the natural substrate, cellobiose. Based on our hypothesis of increasing catalytic activity by reducing the interaction of residues present near the active site tunnel entrance with glucose without disturbing any existing interactions with cellobiose, we report an engineered {beta}-glucosidase (Q319A H0HC94) with a 1.8-fold specific activity increase (366.3 {+/-} 36 {micro}mol/min/mg), an almost 1.5-fold increase in kcat (340.8 {+/-} 27 s-1), and a 3-fold increase in Q319A H0HC94 cellobiose specificity (236.65 mM-1 s-1) over HOHC94. Molecular dynamic simulations and protein structure network analysis indicate that Q319A significantly increased the dynamically stable communities and hub residues, leading to a change in enzyme conformation and higher enzymatic activity. This study shows the impact of rational engineering of non-conserved residue to increase {beta}-glucosidase substrate accessibility and enzyme specificity.\n\nTOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=84 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/505235v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@392a36org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10252d4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18c1749org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4cc8c6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG A rationally engineered -glucosidase with a 1.5-fold increase in kcat, and a 3-fold increase in cellobiose specificity over the wild-type\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "BRCA1 (BReast Cancer-Associated protein 1), a human tumor suppressor, plays a key role in genome stability and DNA repair. Heterodimerization of BRCA1 with BARD1 is important for its stability, maximal Ub ligase (E3) activity and cooperative activation of UbcH5c (E2). Recent studies demonstrate the importance of ubiquitination of the nucleosomal H2A C-terminal tail by BRCA1/BARD1-UbcH5c (E3-E2) in which its mutations inhibit ubiquitination, predispose cells to chromosomal instability and greatly increase the likelihood of breast and ovarian cancer development. Due to the lack of molecular-level insight on the flexible and disordered H2A C-tail, its ubiquitination mechanism by BRCA1/BARD1-UbcH5c and its function and relationship to cancer susceptibility remain elusive. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to provide molecular-level insights into the dynamics of the less-studied H2A C-tail and BRCA1/BARD1-UbcH5c on the nucleosome surface. Our results precisely identify the key interactions and residues that trigger conformational transitions of BRCA1/BARD1-UbcH5c, and characterize the important role of histone electrostatics in their dynamics. We show that the dynamics of the H2A C-tail, combined with the highly mobile UbcH5c, define the ubiquitination capacity. Furthermore, our data demonstrate a mechanistic basis for the probability of ubiquitination of C-tail lysines in the ordered and disordered regions. Altogether, the findings of this study will provide unrevealed insights into the mechanism of H2A C-tail ubiquitination and help us understand the communication between E2-E3 enzymes and nucleosome to regulate ubiquitination machinery, paving the way for the development of effective treatments for cancer and chronic pain.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=88 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/505537v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15c99e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7ab5bdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@31b69forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cca3b3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The aim of this research was to determine if how viruses are co-acquired and co-transmitted changes the probability of acquisition, transmission and new host infections. Whiteflies acquired virus by feeding on singly infected plants, co-infected plants, or by sequential feeding on singly infected plants. Viral titers were also quantified by qPCR in vector cohorts, in artificial diet, and plants after exposure to viruliferous vectors. Differences in transmission, infection status of plants, and titers of TYLCV and ToMoV were observed among treatments. All vector cohorts acquired both viruses, but co-acquisition/co-inoculation generally reduced transmission of both viruses as single and mixed infections. Co-inoculation of viruses by the vector also altered virus accumulation in plants regardless of whether one or both viruses were propagated in new hosts. These findings highlight the complex nature of vector-virus-plant interactions that influence the spread and replication of viruses as single and co-infections.",

    "abstract": "Recent work shows that certain immunological assays for the neurofilament light chain NF-L detect informative signals in the CSF and blood of human and animals affected by a variety of CNS injury and disease states. Much of this work has been performed using two mouse monoclonal antibodies to NF-L, UD1 and UD2, also known as 2.1 and 47.3 respectively. These are the essential components of the Uman Diagnostics NF-Light ELISA kit, the Quanterix Simoa bead based NF-L assay and others. We show here that the antibodies bind to neighboring epitopes in a short, conserved and unusual peptide in the NF-L \"rod\" Coil 2 region. We also describe a surprising and useful feature of Uman and similar reagents. While other well characterized NF-L antibodies show robust staining of countless cells and processes in CNS sections from healthy rats, both Uman antibodies reveal only a minor subset of presumably spontaneously degenerating or degenerated neurons and their processes. However following experimental mid-cervical injuries to rat spinal cord both Uman antibodies recognize numerous profiles in tissue sections. The Uman positive material was associated with fiber tracts expected to be damaged by the injury administered and the profiles had the swollen, beaded, discontinuous and sinusoidal morphology expected for degenerating and degenerated processes. We also found that several antibodies to the C terminal \"tail\" region of NF-L stain undamaged axonal profiles but fail to recognize the Uman positive material. The unmasking of the Uman epitopes and the loss of the NF-L tail epitopes can be mimicked by treating sections from healthy animals with proteases suggesting that the immunological changes we have discovered are due to neurodegeneration induced proteolysis. We have also generated a novel panel of monoclonal and polyclonal antibody reagents directed against the region of NF-L including the Uman epitopes which have staining properties identical to the Uman reagents. Using these we show that the NF-L region to which the Uman reagents bind contains further hidden epitopes distinct from those recognized by the two Uman reagents. We speculate that the Uman type epitopes are part of a binding region important for higher order neurofilament assembly. The work provides important insights into the properties of the NF-L biomarker, describes novel and useful properties of Uman type and NF-L tail binding antibodies and provides a hypothesis relevant to further understanding of neurofilament assembly.",

    "abstract": "Adolescent cocaine abuse increases the risk for developing addiction in later life, which remains a big public health concern, but the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Here, adolescent cocaine-exposed (ACE) male mice models were established by administrating cocaine during adolescent period. When growing to adult age, mice were subjected to conditioned place preference (CPP) to evaluate the sensitivity to cocaine, then potential molecule of dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) were screened out by transcriptomic sequencing. Subthreshold dose of cocaine (sdC), that is insufficient to produce CPP, was used to induce CPP in adulthood. The sdC treatment effectively induced CPP in ACE mice during adulthood, accompanied with the more triggered CaMKII-positive neurons, and induced higher Dusp1 gene, lower DUSP1 protein, lower DUSP1 activity and lower DUSP1 expression on CaMKII-positive neurons (DUSP1CaMKII) in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Overexpressing DUSP1CaMKII suppressed CaMKII-positive neuronal activation, and ultimately blocked sdC-induced CPP in ACE mice during adulthood. While, knocking-down DUSP1CaMKII activated more CaMKII-positive neurons, and aggravated sdC-preferred behavior in ACE mice during adulthood. ERK1/2 might be potential subsequent signal for DUSP1 in the process. Collectively, our findings reveal a novel molecular mechanism underlying adolescent drug abuse-induced susceptibility to addiction during adulthood, and mPFC DUSP1CaMKII is a promising pharmacological target to predict or treat addiction, especially caused by adolescent substance use.\n\nSummaryAdolescent cocaine exposure causes higher cocaine-preferred behaviors during adulthood, along with evoked mPFC activity in response to cocaine challenge. Locally overexpressing but not knocking-down the dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) on CaMKII-positive neurons (DUSP1CaMKII) suppresses mPFC activation, and ultimately rescues the higher sensitivity to cocaine during adulthood.",

    "abstract": "Matrix stiffening and external mechanical stress have been linked to disease and cancer development in multiple tissues, including the liver, where cirrhosis (which increases stiffness markedly) is the major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and lipid-droplet-filled hepatocytes, however, can develop cancer in non-cirrhotic, relatively soft tissue. Here, we show that lipid droplets are intracellular mechanical stressors with similar effects to tissue stiffening, including nuclear deformation, chromatin condensation, and hepatocyte dedifferentiation. Mathematical modelling of lipid droplets as inclusions that have only mechanical interactions with other cellular components generated results consistent with our experiments. These data show that lipid droplets are intracellular sources of mechanical stress and suggest that nuclear membrane tension integrates cell responses to combined internal and external stresses.\n\nSignificance StatementDeformation of the nucleus as a result of extracellular sources of stress, including increased substrate stiffness, constricted migration, and compression, has been well documented to lead to increased nuclear rupture, changes in gene expression, and accumulation of DNA damage. Lipid droplet accumulation in hepatocytes provides a unique scenario to investigate potential intracellular mechanical stresses and sources of nuclear deformation. Our results show that lipid droplets are significant mechanical elements in the cell, deforming the nucleus in a way that promotes hepatocyte dedifferentiation and resisting cytoskeletal contraction and alignment.",

    "abstract": "Symsagittifera roscoffensis is a well-known member of the order Acoela that lives in symbiosis with the algae Tetraselmis convolutae during its adult stage. Its natural habitat is the eastern coast of the Atlantic, where at specific locations thousands of individuals can be found lying in large pools on the surface of sand at low tide and in the sandy interstitial web at high tide. As a member of the Acoela it has been used as a proxy for early bilaterian animals; however, its phylogenetic position remains debated. In order to understand the basic structural characteristics of the acoel genome, we sequenced and assembled the genome of aposymbiotic S. roscoffensis. The size of S. roscoffensis genome was measured to be in range 910 - 940 Mb. Sequencing of the genome was performed using PacBio Hi-Fi technology. Hi-C and RNA-seq data were also generated to scaffold and annotate the genome. The resulting assembly is 1.1 Gb large (covering 118% of the estimated genome size) and highly continuous, with N50 scaffold size of 1.04 Mb. The repetitive fraction of the genome is 61%, of which 85% (half of the genome) are LTR retrotransposons. Genome-guided transcriptome assembly identified 34,493 genes, of which 29,351 are protein coding (BUSCO score 97.6%), and 30.2% of genes are spliced leader (SL) trans-spliced. The completeness of this genome suggests that it can be used extensively to characterize gene families and conduct accurate phylogenomic reconstructions.\n\nSignificanceSymsagittifera is a representative of the phylum Acoela, the first offshoot of bilaterian animals. This key phylogenetic position adds an extra value to the knowledge of its genome, since it will inform us on how the genome of a bilaterian ancestor might have looked like. Moreover, Symsagittifera roscoffensis is a model organism used in symbiogenesis research. Host and algae can be cultured independently and, after mixing, the symbiosis can be followed. Symbiogenesis was established early on during the evolution of Metazoa. In spite of its biological relevance, very little is known on the molecular mechanisms that control it. Here the genome of the acoel host should provide us with insights on the first adaptations to symbiogenesis occurring in bilateral animals.",

Distinct phenotypic differences are observed among the breeds of this species; however, their whole genome sequences were not available. Therefore, in this study, we performed the whole genome sequencing using Illumina short-read technology to construct draft genome assemblies of four B. indicus breeds; Ongole, Kasargod Dwarf, Kasargod Kapila, and Vechur, of which Vechur is known as the smallest cow of the world. We also report the first de novo genome assemblies of these native B. indicus breeds. Further, we constructed the 18S rRNA marker gene sequences of these B. indicus breeds, which were not yet known. Genomic analysis helped to identify the distinct bovine phenotypic characteristics-related and other biological process-related genes in this species compared to B. taurus, and to gain comparative genomic insights between the dwarf and non-dwarf breeds of this species.",

    "abstract": "Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become a core tool for researchers to understand biology. As scRNA-seq has become more ubiquitous, many applications demand higher scalability and sensitivity. Split-pool combinatorial barcoding makes it possible to scale projects to hundreds of samples and millions of cells, overcoming limitations of previous droplet based technologies. However, there is still a need for increased sensitivity for both droplet and combinatorial barcoding based scRNA-seq technologies. To meet this need, here we introduce an updated combinatorial barcoding method for scRNA-seq with dramatically improved sensitivity. To assess performance, we profile a variety of sample types, including cell lines, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), mouse brain nuclei, and mouse liver nuclei. When compared to the previously best performing approach, we find up to a 2.6-fold increase in unique transcripts detected per cell and up to a 1.8-fold increase in genes detected per cell. These improvements to transcript and gene detection increase the resolution of the resulting data, making it easier to distinguish cell types and states in heterogeneous samples. Split-pool combinatorial barcoding already enables scaling to millions of cells, the ability to perform scRNA-seq on previously fixed and frozen samples, and access to scRNA-seq without the need to purchase specialized lab equipment. Our hope is that by combining these previous advantages with the dramatic improvements to sensitivity presented here, we will elevate the standards and capabilities of scRNA-seq for the broader community.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular proteases must be specific to avoid degrading the wrong proteins. Here, we present cryo-EM structures of E. coli ClpXP, a AAA+ protease, which reveal that the axial channel of ClpX is closed prior to the binding and subsequent translocation of a protein substrate. An open-channel ClpX mutation stimulates degradation of casein, a non-specific substrate, indicating that channel closure contributes to increased degradation specificity. We demonstrate that ClpX activates ClpP cleavage of a degron-free decapeptide by a channel-independent mechanism, in which the peptide substrate appears to pass through a symmetry mismatched gap in the interface between ClpX and ClpP before entering the degradation chamber via the axial portal of ClpP. The peptide products of ClpXP protein degradation are likely to exit the chamber by the reverse route.",

Previously, our in vitro studies validated the anti-cancer activities of Musa flower extracts and confirmed the potential. This thread has led to our current investigation to explore the anticancer potential in vivo.\n\nPurposeThis study focused on the efficacy of banana florets on DMBA induced breast cancer in female wistar rats.\n\nMethodsInduction of tumour using Dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA) in female wistar rats. Hormonal, antioxidant and anticarcinogenic studies were performed in vivo.\n\nResultsIn our current study, we investigated that tumour induction has an effect in disrupting the estrous cycle in mice which may result by hormonal fluctuation levels. Antioxidant and hormonal analysis in vivo revealed the imbalance in estrogen and progesterone levels in untreated group compared to the treated ones. Floral crude extract treatment in vivo has shrunken the tumour volume in flower extract treatment group as well as in standard drug compared to the control. Histopathological staining confirms the disruption of epithelial tissues in tumour induced groups compared to the treated ones. Moreover, Musa floral treatment has shown to revert the damaged tissue morphology in the treated groups compared to the saline treated one. In-vitro studies in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell lines has shown the potent anti-tumorigenic activity using Musa floral extracts.\n\nConclusionTaken together, our finding confirmed that banana flower extracts showcase anti-carcinogenic activity against breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Tumour induction in mice has an effect in showing the disruption of estrous cycles.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMusa paradisiaca crude ethanolic flower extracts have a potential in reducing the tumour growth.\nC_LIO_LIDMBA induced cancer has a deleterious effect on estrogen cycles in female wistar rats.\nC_LIO_LIDisruption of epithelial morphology was observed in tumour induced wistar rats.\nC_LIO_LITreatment with crude Musa flower extracts on cancer induced rats shows the reduced level of damage and oxidative stress compared to the no treatment group.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-wildtype (hereafter, GB), is an aggressive brain malignancy associated with a dismal prognosis and poor quality of life. Single-cell RNA sequencing has helped to grasp the complexity of the cell states and dynamic changes in GB. Large-scale data integration can help to uncover unexplored tumor pathobiology. Here, we resolved the composition of the tumor milieu and created a cellular map of GB ( GBmap), a curated resource that harmonizes 26 datasets gathering 240 patients and spanning over 1.1 million cells. We showcase the applications of our resource for reference mapping, transfer learning, and biological discoveries. Our results uncover the sources of pro-angiogenic signaling and the multifaceted role of mesenchymal-like cancer cells. Reconstructing the tumor architecture using spatially resolved transcriptomics unveiled a high level of well-structured neoplastic niches. The GBmap represents a framework that allows the streamlined integration and interpretation of new data and provides a platform for exploratory analysis, hypothesis generation and testing.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=174 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/505439v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (61K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7f0d76org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14cbe3borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15d1e69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@77b16f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A novel macrocyclic inhibitor of mutant EGFR (BI-4020) has shown promise in pre-clinical studies of T790M and C797S drug-resistant non-small cell lung cancer. To better understand the molecular basis for BI-4020 selectivity and potency, we have carried out biochemical activity assays and structural analysis with X-ray crystallography. Biochemical potencies agree with previous studies indicating that BI-4020 is uniquely potent against drug-resistant L858R/T790M and L858R/T790M/C797S variants. Structures show that BI-4020 is likely rendered selective due to interactions with the kinase domain hinge region as well as T790M, akin to Osimertinib. Additionally, BI-4020 is also rendered more potent due to its constrained macrocycle geometry as well as additional H-bonds to conserved K745 and T845 residues in both active and inactive conformations. These findings taken together show how this novel macrocyclic inhibitor is both highly potent and selective for mutant EGFR in a reversible mechanism and motivate structure-inspired approaches to developing targeted therapies in medicinal oncology.",
