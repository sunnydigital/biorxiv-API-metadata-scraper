    "abstract": "A variety of organisms have been shown to have altered physiology or developed pathology due to gene transfer, but mammals have never been shown to do so. Here, we show that circulating tumor DNA (ct) can promote cell-specific horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between human cancer cells and explain the mechanisms behind this phenomenon. Once ctDNA enters the host cell, it migrates to the nucleus and integrates into the cells genome, thereby transferring its genetic information. We determine that retrotransposons of the ERVL, SINE, and LINE families are necessary for cell targeting and the integration of ctDNA into host DNA. Using chemically synthesized retrotransposons, we found that AluSp and MER11C reproduced multiple myelomas (MM) ctDNAs cell targeting and integration into MM cells. We also discovered that ctDNA might, as a result of HGT, influence the treatment response of multiple myeloma and pancreatic cancer models. Overall, this is the first study to show that retrotransposon-directed HGT can promote genetic material transfer in cancer. There is, however, a broader impact of our findings than just cancer since cell-free DNA has also been found in physiological and other pathological conditions as well. Furthermore, with the discovery of transposons-mediated tissue-specific targeting, a new avenue for the delivery of genes and therapies will emerge.",

    "abstract": "Enormous progress continues in the field of cancer biology, yet much remains to be unveiled regarding the mechanisms of cancer invasion. In particular, complex biophysical mechanisms enable a tumor to remodel the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), thus allowing cells to escape and invade alone or as multicellular collectives. Tumor spheroids cultured in collagen represent a simplified, reproducible 3D model system, which is sufficiently complex to recapitulate the evolving internal organization of cells and external interaction with the ECM that occur during invasion. Recent experimental approaches enable high resolution imaging and quantification of the internal structure of invading tumor spheroids. Concurrently, computational modeling enables simulations of complex multicellular aggregates based on first principles. The comparison between real and simulated spheroids represents a way to fully exploit both data sources, but remains a challenging task. We hypothesize that comparing any two spheroids requires first the extraction of basic features from the raw data, and second the definition of key metrics to match such features. Here, we present a novel data-agnostic method to compare spatial features of spheroids in 3D. To do so, we define and extract features from spheroid point cloud data, which we simulated using Cells in Silico (CiS), a high-performance framework for large-scale tissue modeling previously developed by our group. We then define metrics to compare features between individual spheroids, and combine all metrics into an overall deviation score. Finally, we use our features to compare experimental data on invading spheroids in increasing collagen densities. We propose that our approach represents the basis for defining improved metrics to compare large 3D data sets. Moving forward, this approach will enable informing in silico spheroids based on their in vitro counterparts, and vice versa, thus enabling both basic and applied researchers to close the loop between modeling and experiments in cancer research.\n\nAuthor summaryCells within a tumor use various methods to escape and thereby invade into healthy parts of the body. These methods are studied experimentally by examining tumor spheroids, spherical aggregates of hundreds to thousands of individual cells. Such spheroids can also be simulated, and the comparison of simulation and experiment is desirable. Here, we present an analysis strategy for the comparison of tumor spheroids, a widely used workhorse of cancer research. Using this strategy, we aim to improve the collaborative potential between experimentalists and theorists.",

    "abstract": "Transmissible cancers are infectious parasitic clones of malignant cells that metastasize to new hosts, living past the death of the founder animal in which the cancer initiated. Several lineages of transmissible cancer have recently been identified in bivalves, including one that has spread through the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) population along the east coast of North America. To investigate the evolutionary history of this transmissible cancer lineage, we assembled a highly contiguous 1.2 Gb soft-shell clam reference genome and characterized somatic mutations from cancer sequences. We show that all cancer cases observed descend from a single founder and cluster into two geographically distinct sub-lineages. We discover a previously unreported clock-like mutational signature that predicts the cancer lineage to be 344 to 877 years old, indicating that it spread undetected long before it was first observed in the 1970s. We observe high mutation density, widespread copy number gain, structural rearrangement, loss of heterozygosity, variable telomere lengths, mitochondrial genome expansion, and transposable element activity, all indicative of an unstable cancer genome. Our study reveals the ability for an invertebrate cancer lineage to survive for centuries while its genome continues to structurally mutate, likely contributing to the ability of this lineage to adapt as a parasitic cancer.\n\nSUMMARYThe genome of a contagious cancer in clams reveals structural instability of multiple types throughout the [~]500 years since its origin.",

    "abstract": "Bovine polyomavirus-1 (BoPyV-1, Epsilonpolyomavirus bovis) is widespread in cattle and has been detected in commercialized beef at supermarkets in the USA and Germany. BoPyV-1 has been questioned as a probable zoonotic agent with documented increase in seropositivity in people exposed to cattle. However, to date, BoPyV-1 has not been causally associated with pathology or disease in any animal species, including humans. Here we describe and illustrate pathological findings in an aborted bovine fetus naturally infected with BoPyV-1, providing evidence of its pathogenicity and probable abortigenic potential. Our results indicate that: (i) BoPyV-1 can cause severe kidney lesions in cattle, including tubulointerstitial nephritis with cytopathic changes and necrosis in tubular epithelial cells, tubular and interstitial inflammation, and interstitial fibroplasia; (ii) lesions are at least partly attributable to active viral replication in renal tubular epithelial cells, which have abundant intranuclear viral inclusions; (iii) BoPyV-1 large T (LT) antigen, resulting from early viral gene expression, can be detected in infected renal tubular epithelial cells using a monoclonal antibody raised against Simian Virus-40 polyomavirus LT antigen; and (iv) there is productive BoPyV-1 replication and virion assembly in the nuclei of renal tubular epithelial cells as demonstrated by the ultrastructural observation of abundant arrays of viral particles with typical polyomavirus morphology. Altogether, these lesions resemble the \"cytopathic-inflammatory pathology pattern\" proposed in the pathogenesis of Human polyomavirus-1-associated nephropathy in immunocompromised people and kidney allograft recipients. Additionally, we sequenced the complete genome of the BoPyV-1 infecting the fetus, which represents the first whole genome of a BoPyV-1 from the Southern Hemisphere. Lastly, the BoPyV-1 strain infecting this fetus was isolated, causing cytopathic effect in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells. We conclude that BoPyV-1 is pathogenic to the bovine fetus under natural circumstances. Further insights into the epidemiology, biology, clinical relevance, and zoonotic potential of BoPyV-1 are needed.\n\nAuthor SummaryWhile bovine polyomavirus-1 seems to have a broad geographic distribution, whether this virus is responsible for disease and organ damage (lesions) in the cattle it infects is unknown. In this study, we describe and illustrate organ damage in an aborted bovine fetus naturally infected with bovine polyomavirus-1. Our results indicate that this virus is pathogenic, this means it can cause lesions and disease under natural circumstances in cattle. Interestingly, the organ damage in the fetus attributable to this viral infection closely resembles the lesions caused by related viruses within the same viral family (Polyomaviridae) in immunocompromised human patients and kidney transplant recipients. This study sets the bases to frame further research to learn more about whether bovine polyomavirus-1 causes abortion in cattle, and to a broader extent how polyomaviruses cause disease in animals and humans.",

    "abstract": "Ethylene is known to stimulate plant respiration, and this later is always associated with heat generation. The grapevine fruit set is dependent upon pistil temperature, controlling the pollen germination and ovule fertilization. This led us to test whether ethylene would be able to impact fruit set often limited in cool climate conditions, particularly in the case of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Malbec, a variety prone to poor fruit set. With this cultivar, we ran trials in growth chambers using the ethylene gas, and field trials using ethephon as an ethylene precursor. At 14.5 {degrees}C ambient temperature, we observed that ethylene at 1 and 10 ppm increased the stigma and pistil temperature to 15 {degrees}C, compared to 14.7 {degrees}C in controls. This minor temperature rise was associated with an increase of fruit set from 10 to 25 %. The field trials, conducted in the South West of France, confirmed this trend. Indeed, spraying a concentration as low as 216 mg/ha of ethephon onto Malbec at full bloom at 16 {degrees}C in the shade, led to an increase of fruit set from 35 % to 45 %. These experiments suggest that spraying ultra-low concentrations of ethylene precursors onto the grapevines prone to poor fruit set, during cool mornings, could improve fruit set and reduce crop losses.",

    "abstract": "Dynamical models in the form of systems of ordinary differential equations have become a standard tool in systems biology. Many parameters of such models are usually unknown and have to be inferred from experimental data. Gradient-based optimization has proven to be effective for parameter estimation. However, computing gradients becomes increasingly costly for larger models, which are required for capturing the complex interactions of multiple biochemical pathways. Adjoint sensitivity analysis has been pivotal for working with such large models, but methods tailored for steady-state data are currently not available. We propose a new adjoint method for computing gradients, which is applicable if the experimental data include steady-state measurements. The method is based on a reformulation of the backward integration problem to a system of linear algebraic equations. The evaluation of the proposed method using real-world problems shows a speedup of total simulation time by a factor of up to 4.4. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve a substantial improvement in computation time, in particular for large-scale models, where computational efficiency is critical.\n\nAuthor summaryLarge-scale dynamical models are nowadays widely used for the analysis of complex processes and the integration of large-scale data sets. However, computational cost is often a bottleneck. Here, we propose a new gradient computation method that facilitates the parameterization of large-scale models based on steady-state measurements. The method can be combined with existing gradient computation methods for time-course measurements. Accordingly, it is an essential contribution to the environment of computationally efficient approaches for the study of large-scale screening and omics data, but not tailored to biological applications, and, therefore, also useful beyond the field of computational biology.",

    "abstract": "To gain insights into the genotype-phenotype relationships in Mycoplasmas, we set to investigate which Mycoplasma proteins are most predictive of tissue and host trophism and to which functional groups of proteins they belong. We retrieved and annotated 430 Mycoplasma genomes and combined their genome information with data on which host and tissue these Mycoplasmas were isolated from. We assessed clustering of Mycoplasma strains from a wide range of hosts and tissues based on different functional groups of proteins. Additionally, we assessed clustering using only a subset of M. pneumoniae strains based on different functional groups of proteins. We found that proteins belonging to the Gene Ontology (GO) Biological process group  Interspecies interaction between organisms proteins are most important for predicting the pathogenesis of Mycoplasma strains whereas for M. pneumoniae, those belonging to  Quorum sensing and  Biofilm formation proteins are most important for predicting pathogenesis.\n\nTwo Random Forest Classifiers were trained to accurately predicts host and tissue specificity based on only 12 proteins. For Mycoplasma host specificity CTP synthase complex, magnesium transporter MgtE, and glycine cleavage system are most important for correctly classifying Mycoplasma strains that infect humans, including opportunistic zoonotic strains. For tissue specificity, we found that a) known virulence and adhesions factor Methionine sulphate reductase MetA is predictive of urinary tract infecting Mycoplasmas; b) an extra cytoplasmic thiamine binding lipoprotein is most predictive of gastro-intestinal infecting Mycoplasmas; c) a type I restriction endonuclease is most predictive of respiratory infecting Mycoplasmas, and; d) a branched-chain amino acid transport system is most predictive for blood infecting Mycoplasmas. These findings can aid in predicting host and tissue specific pathogenicity of Mycoplasmas as well as provide insight in which proteins are important for specific host and tissue adaptations.

The vast amount of data resulting from this magnitude of channels in overnight EEG recordings complicates the removal of artifacts.\n\nNew MethodWe present a new, semi-automatic artifact removal routine specifically designed for sleep hd-EEG recordings. By employing a graphical user interface (GUI), the user assesses epochs in regard to four sleep quality markers (SQMs). Based on their topography and underlying EEG signal, the user eventually removes artifactual values. To identify artifacts, the user is required to have basic knowledge of the typical (patho-)physiological EEG they are interested in, as well as artifactual EEG. The final output consists of a binary matrix (channels x epochs). Channels affected by artifacts can be restored in afflicted epochs using epoch-wise interpolation, a function included in the online repository.\n\nResultsThe routine was applied in 54 overnight sleep hd-EEG recordings. The proportion of bad epochs highly depends on the number of channels required to be artifact-free. Between 95% and 100% of bad epochs could be restored using epoch-wise interpolation. We furthermore present a detailed examination of two extreme cases (with few and many artifacts). For both nights, the topography and cyclic pattern of delta power look as expected after artifact removal.\n\nComparison with Existing MethodsNumerous artifact removal methods exist, yet their scope of application usually targets short wake EEG recordings. The proposed routine provides a transparent, practical, and efficient approach to identify artifacts in overnight sleep hd-EEG recordings.\n\nConclusionsThis method reliably identifies artifacts simultaneously in all channels and epochs.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral blood flow is important for the maintenance of brain function and its dysregulation has been implicated in Alzheimers disease (AD). Subpopulations of microglia have well-characterised associations with the vasculature in the central nervous system but the precise relationship between microglia and cells which exist on the vasculature is not yet clear. In this study we explored the relationship between microglia and pericytes, a vessel-resident cell type that has a major role in the regulation of cerebral blood flow and maintenance of the blood brain barrier. Using fixed tissue sections and in vivo live imaging, we discovered a subset of microglia that closely associated with pericytes, termed PEricyte-associated Microglia (PEM). PEM are present throughout all regions of the brain and spinal cord in NG2DsRed x CX3CR1+/GFP mice, and in the human frontal cortex. They reside adjacent to pericytes at all levels of the capillary tree and can maintain their position for at least 28 days. PEM associate with pericytes lacking astroglial endfeet coverage but are segregated from pericytes by capillary basement membranes and capillary vessel width is similarly increased beneath pericytes with or without an associated PEM. Deletion of the microglia fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) did not disrupt the association between pericytes and PEM, suggesting the association is not reliant on fractalkine signalling. Finally, we found that the proportion of microglia that are capillary-associated and PEM declines in the superior frontal gyrus (SFG) in AD, which is exacerbated by the APOE {varepsilon}3/{varepsilon}4 genotype. In summary, we identify and characterise a subpopulation of microglia that specifically associate with pericytes and find this population is reduced in the SFG in AD. This reduction may be a novel mechanism contributing to vascular dysfunction in diseases such as AD.",

    "abstract": "Animals that consume fermenting fruit or nectar are exposed to ethanol, thus increasing their risk of injury or predation. This risk is heightened in humans, who have actively imbibed alcohol for thousands of years. In this report, we show that the hormone FGF21, which is strongly induced by ethanol in murine and human liver, exerts sobering or \"amethystic\" effects on both arousal and motor coordination without changing ethanol catabolism. Mice lacking FGF21 take longer than wild-type littermates to recover their righting reflex and balance following ethanol exposure. Conversely, pharmacologic FGF21 administration reduces the time needed for mice to recover from ethanol-induced unconsciousness and ataxia. FGF21 mediates it amethystic effects by directly activating the noradrenergic nervous system, which regulates arousal and alertness. These results indicate that this FGF21 liver-brain pathway evolved to protect against ethanolinduced intoxication and that it might be targeted pharmaceutically for treating acute alcohol poisoning.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) is the most prevalent chronic neurodegenerative disease, affecting more than 55 million people worldwide. AD is clinically characterized by a progressive loss of memory and other cognitive functions, which implicate the cholinergic system. Activity-induced neuroprotection based on gamma oscillation-audiovisual stimuli-is shown to be possible. Bulk RNA-seq data from treatment involving sensory stimuli were obtained, and bioinformatics analyses were performed. Activity-induced neuroprotection was found to be strongly associated with the downregulation of synaptic calcium signaling and cholinergic transmission. Candidate genes were screened in consultation with the Allen Brain Atlas Transcriptomics Explorer. We propose that Chrnb4 and Plcb4 are potential therapeutic targets for AD treatment. Chrnb4 has already been identified as a potential immune-relevant drug target gene using ontology inference, network analysis, and methylation signal, while multiple studies suggest that primary phospholipase C proteins play an integral role in inducing cell death in AD. Hence, both Chrnb4 and Plcb4 should be considered for future in vitro and in vivo studies as candidate genes.",

    "abstract": "There is significant interest in using neuroimaging data to predict behavior. The predictive models are often interpreted by the computation of feature importance, which quantifies the predictive relevance of an imaging feature. Tian and Zalesky (2021) suggest that feature importance estimates exhibit low split-half reliability, as well as a trade-off between prediction accuracy and feature importance reliability across parcellation resolutions. However, it is unclear whether the trade-off between prediction accuracy and feature importance reliability is universal. Here, we demonstrate that, with a sufficient sample size, feature importance (operationalized as Haufe-transformed weights) can achieve fair to excellent split-half reliability. With a sample size of 2600 participants, Haufe-transformed weights achieve average intra-class correlation coefficients of 0.75, 0.57 and 0.53 for cognitive, personality and mental health measures respectively. Haufe-transformed weights are much more reliable than original regression weights and univariate FC-behavior correlations. Original regression weights are not reliable even with 2600 participants. Intriguingly, feature importance reliability is strongly positively correlated with prediction accuracy across phenotypes. Within a particular behavioral domain, there is no clear relationship between prediction performance and feature importance reliability across regression models. Furthermore, we show mathematically that feature importance reliability is necessary, but not sufficient, for low feature importance error. In the case of linear models, lower feature importance error is mathematically related to lower prediction error. Therefore, higher feature importance reliability might yield lower feature importance error and higher prediction accuracy. Finally, we discuss how our theoretical results relate with the reliability of imaging features and behavioral measures. Overall, the current study provides empirical and theoretical insights into the relationship between prediction accuracy and feature importance reliability.",

    "abstract": "Food is a powerful natural reinforcer that guides feeding decisions. The vagus nerve conveys internal sensory information from the gut to the brain about nutritional value; however, the cellular and molecular basis of macronutrient-specific reward circuits are poorly understood. Here, we monitor in vivo calcium dynamics to provide direct evidence of independent vagal sensing pathways for detection of dietary fats and sugars. Using activity-dependent genetic capture of nutrient-specific vagal neurons activated in response gut infusions, we demonstrate the existence of separate hard-wired reward circuits for fat and sugar that are necessary and sufficient for nutrient-specific reinforcement. Even when controlling for calories, combined activation of fat and sugar circuits increases overeating compared to fat or sugar alone. This work provides new insight on the complex sensory circuitry that mediates motivated behavior and suggests that a subconscious internal drive to consume obesogenic diets (e.g., those high in both fat and sugar) may impede conscious dieting efforts.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBorderline Personality Disorder (BPD) symptoms often emerge in adolescence. However, little is known about the functional organization of intrinsic brain networks in young people with BPD symptoms.\n\nMethodsIn this study we collected resting-state fMRI data in a sample of adolescents and young adults with (nBPD = 40) and without BPD (nHC= 42) symptoms. Using a detailed cortico-limbic parcellation coupled with graph theoretical analyses, we tested for group and age-related differences in regional functional and effective connectivity (FC, EC) and amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). We conducted a series of analyses that progressed from global network properties to focal tests of EC amongst nodes in Salience (SN) and Dorsal Attention Networks (DAN).\n\nResultsAt the regional level, regularized regression analyses revealed a broad pattern of hyper-connectivity and heightened ALFF in R dorsal anterior insula (daIns), in addition to hypoconnectivity in R temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) and decreased ALFF in multiple DAN regions. Furthermore, analyses of EC amongst daIns, TPJ, and DAN revealed that in BPD participants daIns exerts a heightened influence on TPJ and DAN regions. Finally, multivariate mediation models indicated that lower DANALFF was differentially predicted by EC from TPJ and daIns.\n\nConclusionsOur findings provide converging evidence that heightened EC from daIns impairs network-wide ALFF in DAN both directly and indirectly via impaired TPJ functioning. We interpret this pattern of findings in line with an \"attentional hijacking\" account of borderline personality.",

    "abstract": "While depression and chronic pain are frequently comorbid, underlying neuronal circuits, and their relevance for the understanding of psychopathology, remain poorly defined. Here we show in mice that hyperactivity of the neuronal pathway linking the basolateral amygdala to the anterior cingulate cortex is essential for chronic pain-induced depression. In naive animals, we demonstrate that activation of this pathway is sufficient to trigger depressive-like behaviors, as well as transcriptomic alterations that recapitulate core molecular features of depression in the human brain. These alterations notably impact gene modules related to myelination and the oligodendrocyte lineage. Among these, we show that Sema4a, a hub gene significantly upregulated in both mice and humans in the context of altered mood, is necessary for the emergence of depressive-like behaviors. Overall, these results place the BLA-ACC pathway at the core of pain and depression comorbidity, and unravel the role of impaired myelination and Sema4a in mood control.",

Using relative or quantitative two-photon fluorescence Ca2+ imaging in acute brain slices or in vivo in the somatosensory cortex from Sprague Dawley rats and C57Bl/6 mice, we showed that changes to external K+ (+/-1mM to 2.5mM) reciprocally controls the astrocyte Rhod-2 or OGB-1 Ca2+-dependent fluorescence in the soma, major processes and endfeet. The astrocyte Ca2+ decrease when [K+]o was elevated was sensitive to lowering the external concentration of Ca2+, Cl-, and HCO3-, but not Na+. Unexpectedly, the phenomenon was blocked by inhibiting K-Cl cotransport. Picrotoxin induced ictal neural activity drove an analogous decrease of astrocyte Ca2+. K+ mediated cerebral arteriole dilation in brain slices was also sensitive to inhibiting K-Cl cotransport as well as whole-cell patching a peri-arteriole astrocyte which perturbs normal Ca2+, Cl- and HCO3- concentration gradients.

    "abstract": "During a critical period of postnatal life, monocular deprivation (MD) of kittens by eyelid closure reduces the size of neurons in layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) connected to the deprived eye, and shifts cortical ocular dominance in favor of the non-deprived eye, modeling deprivation amblyopia in humans. Following long-term MD, temporary retinal inactivation of the non-deprived eye with microinjection of tetrodotoxin can promote superior recovery from MD, and at older ages, in comparison to conventional occlusion therapy. This suggests that monocular inactivation (MI) is a more potent approach to producing neural plasticity than occlusion. In the current study we assessed the modification of neuron size in the dLGN as a means of measuring the impact of a brief period of MI imposed at different ages during postnatal development. The biggest impact of inactivation was observed when it occurred at the peak of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. The effect of MI was evident in both the binocular and monocular segments of the dLGN, distinguishing it from MD that produces changes only within the binocular segment. With increasing age, the capacity for inactivation to alter postsynaptic cell size diminished but was still significant beyond the classic critical period. In comparison to MD, inactivation consistently produced effects that were about double in magnitude, and inactivation exhibited efficacy to produce neural modifications at older ages than MD. Notwithstanding the large neural alterations precipitated by inactivation, its anatomical effects were remediated with a short period of binocular visual experience, and vision through the previously inactivated eye fully recovered after washout of TTX. Our results demonstrate that MI is a potent means of modifying the visual pathway, and does so beyond the age at which occlusion is effective. The magnitude and longevity of inactivation to evoke neural modification highlights its potential to ameliorate disorders of the visual system such as amblyopia.",

    "abstract": "A well-coordinated control of motor neuronal persistent inward currents (PICs) via diffuse neuromodulation and local inhibition is essential to ensure motor units discharge at required times and frequencies. Current best estimates indicate that PICs are reduced in older adults; however, it is not yet known whether PIC facilitation-inhibition control is also altered with ageing. We investigated the responses of PICs to i) a remote handgrip contraction, which is believed to diffusely increase serotonergic input onto motor neurones, and ii) tendon vibration of the antagonist muscle, which elicits reciprocal inhibition, in both young and older adults. High-density surface electromyograms were collected from soleus and tibialis anterior of 18 young and 26 older adults during triangular-shaped plantar and dorsiflexion contractions to 20% (handgrip experiments) and 30% (vibration experiments) of maximum torque (rise-decline rate of 2%/s). The paired-motor-unit analysis was used to calculate {Delta}F, which is assumed proportional to PIC strength. {Delta}F increased in both soleus (0.55pps, 16.0%) and tibialis anterior (0.42pps, 11.4%) during the handgrip contraction independent of age. However, although antagonist tendon vibration reduced {Delta}F in soleus (0.28pps, 12.6%) independent of age, less reduction was observed in older (0.42pps, 10.7%) than young adults (0.72pps, 17.8%) in tibialis anterior. Our data indicate a preserved ability of older adults to amplify PICs following a remote handgrip contraction, during which increased serotonergic input onto the motor neurones is expected, in both lower leg muscles. However, PIC deactivation in response to reciprocal inhibition was impaired with ageing in tibialis anterior despite being preserved in soleus.\n\nKEYPOINTSO_LIMotor neuronal persistent inward currents (PICs) are amplified via diffuse neuromodulation and deactivated by local inhibition to ensure motor units discharge at required times and frequencies, allowing a normal motor behaviour.\nC_LIO_LIPIC amplitudes appear to be reduced with ageing, however it is not known whether PIC facilitation-inhibition control is also altered.\nC_LIO_LIRemote handgrip contraction, which should diffusely increase serotonergic input onto motor neurones, amplified PICs similarly in both soleus and tibialis anterior of young and older adults.\nC_LIO_LIAntagonist tendon vibration, which induces reciprocal inhibition, reduced PICs in soleus in both young and older adults but had less effect in tibialis anterior in older adults.\nC_LIO_LIOur data suggest that older adults have preserved soleus PIC facilitation during lowintensity contractions, equivalent to activities such as standing and walking.

    "abstract": "Cell transplantation is a promising therapeutic approach to recover loss of neurons and vision in patient retinas. So far, human photoreceptor transplants restored some visual function in degenerating mouse retina. Whether retinal cell transplants also integrate into human retina, and how to optimize this for different pathologies are still unknown. Here, we sought to determine if human retina organoids generated from pluripotent stem cells might assist cell replacement therapy development in a human-to-human setting. Models for intra- and subretinal cell transplantation strategies were explored: Photoreceptor donor cells carrying a transgenic fluorescent reporter were enriched from acutely dissociated human retinal organoids. Donor cells were precisely transplanted by microinjection into the retina of host organoids, but high cell numbers might require multiple injections posing potential damage. Alternatively, donor cells were transplanted in large numbers by placing them in subretinal-like contact to the apical organoid surface. Using postmitotic retinal organoids (age >170-days) as a source for donor cells and as hosts, we show that six weeks after subretinal-like transplantation, large clusters of photoreceptors reproducibly incorporate into the host retina. Transplanted clusters frequently are located within or across the host photoreceptor layer, include cone and rod photoreceptors, and become infiltrated by cell processes of host Muller glia, indicative of structural integration. Histological and ultrastructural data of virally-labeled photoreceptor transplants show characteristic morphological and structural features of polarized photoreceptors: inner segments and ribbon synapses, and donor-host cell contacts develop contributing to the retinal outer limiting membrane. These results demonstrate that human retinal organoids provide a preclinical research system for cell replacement therapies.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=193 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/500037v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3a405dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57c4deorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3de9c5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@be9820_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Humans accumulate with age the dark-brown pigment neuromelanin inside specific neuronal groups. Neurons with the highest neuromelanin levels are particularly susceptible to degeneration in Parkinsons disease, especially dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra (SN), the loss of which leads to characteristic motor Parkinsons disease symptoms. In contrast to humans, neuromelanin does not appear spontaneously in most animals, including rodents, and Parkinsons disease is an exclusively human condition. Using humanized neuromelanin-producing rodents, we recently found that neuromelanin can trigger Parkinsons disease pathology when accumulated above a specific pathogenic threshold.\n\nHere, by taking advantage of this newly developed animal model, we assessed whether the intracellular buildup of neuromelanin that occurs with age can be slowed down in vivo to prevent or attenuate Parkinsons disease. Because neuromelanin derives from the oxidation of free cytosolic dopamine, we enhanced dopamine vesicular encapsulation in the SN of neuromelanin-producing rats by viral vector-mediated overexpression of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). This strategy reduced the formation of potentially toxic oxidized dopamine species that can convert into neuromelanin and maintained intracellular neuromelanin levels below their pathogenic threshold. Decreased neuromelanin production was associated with an attenuation of Lewy body-like inclusion formation and a long-term preservation of dopamine homeostasis, nigrostriatal neuronal integrity and motor function in these animals.\n\nOur results demonstrate the feasibility and therapeutic potential of modulating age-dependent intracellular neuromelanin production in vivo, thereby opening an unexplored path for the treatment of Parkinsons disease and, in a broader sense, brain aging.",

    "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests a role for the microbiome-gut-brain axis in amyloid-associated neurodegeneration, but the pathogenic changes induced by amyloids in the gastro-intestinal tract remain elusive. To scrutinize the early response to amyloids of human and bacterial origin, we challenged primary murine myenteric networks with A{beta}1-42 (vs a scrambled version of A{beta}1-42) and curli (vs culture medium), respectively, and performed shotgun RNA sequencing. Both amyloid types induced a transcriptional signature of DNA damage and cell cycle dysregulation. Using in vitro neurosphere-derived cultures and in vivo amyloid injections we found that enteric glia and smooth muscle cells were the most responsive cell types, showing increased proliferation, {gamma}H2AX burden and SOD2 levels after amyloid challenge. Consistent with this activated state, we identified a pro-inflammatory hub in the transcriptional profile of amyloid-stimulated myenteric networks. Enteric glia were the principal source of the associated cytokines, and in vivo, this was accompanied by an influx of immune cells. Together, these results shed new light on the intrinsic vulnerability of ENS cells to both amyloid species and position enteric glial cell activation as an early driver of neurodegenerative disease progression.\n\nSignificance statementThe increasing socio-economic impact of Alzheimers disease (AD), long sub-clinical disease progression window, and failure of drug candidates demand mechanistic insight into the early stages of disease development. Epidemiological associations and experimental studies in rodents suggest that the gut may be vulnerable to amyloids and mediate their transfer to the brain. However, whether and how amyloids induce local pathology in the gastro-intestinal wall is not known. We identified a pathogenic program that becomes activated in the gastro-intestinal tract after exposure to amyloid {beta} and curli (the main bacterial amyloid), and show that enteric glia are responsible for creating an amyloid-induced pro-inflammatory environment. This insight of an early response in a distant, more accessible organ than the brain, may have important implications for both disease diagnosis and therapy.",

    "abstract": "Flexible neural electrodes improve the recording longevity and quality of individual neurons by promoting tissue-electrode integration. However, the intracortical implantation of flexible electrodes inevitably induces tissue damage. Understanding the longitudinal neural and vascular recovery following the intracortical implantation is critical for the ever-growing applications of flexible electrodes in both healthy and disordered brains. Aged animals are of particular interest because they play a key role in modeling neurological disorders, but their tissue-electrode interface remains mostly unstudied. Here we integrate in-vivo two-photon imaging and electrophysiological recording to determine the time-dependent neural and vascular dynamics after the implantation of ultraflexible neural electrodes in aged mice. We find heightened angiogenesis and vascular remodeling in the first two weeks after implantation, which coincides with the rapid increase in local field potentials and unit activities detected by electrophysiological recordings. Vascular remodeling in shallow cortical layers preceded that in deeper layers, which often lasted longer than the recovery of neural signals. By six weeks post-implantation vascular abnormalities had subsided, resulting in normal vasculature and microcirculation. Putative cell classification based on firing pattern and waveform shows similar recovery time courses in fast-spiking interneurons and pyramidal neurons. These results elucidate how structural damages and remodeling near implants affecting recording efficacy, and support the application of ultraflexible electrodes in aged animals at minimal perturbations to endogenous neurophysiology.",

As such, multiple methods were proposed to use T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires to detect disease history. We here show that the counting method outperforms all existing algorithms. We then show that the counting can be further improved using a novel attention model to weight the different TCRs. The attention model is based on the projection of TCRs using a Variational AutoEncoder (VAE). Both counting and attention algorithms predict better than any current algorithm whether the host had CMV and its HLA alleles. As an intermediate solution between the complex attention model and the very simple counting model, we propose a new Graph Convolutional Network approach that obtains the accuracy of the attention model and the simplicity of the counting model.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSyngnathids are a highly derived and diverse fish clade comprising the pipefishes, pipe-horses and seahorses. They are characterized by a plethora of iconic traits that increasingly capture the attention of biologists, including geneticists, ecologists and developmental biologists. The current understanding of the origins of their derived body plan is, however, hampered by incomplete and limited descriptions of the early syngnathid ontogeny.\n\nResultsWe provide a comprehensive description of the development of Nerophis ophidion, Syngnathus typhle, Hippocampus erectus from early cleavage stages to release from the male brooding organ and beyond, including juvenile development. We comparatively describe skeletogenesis with a particular focus on dermal bony plates, the snout-like jaw morphology, and appendages.\n\nConclusionsThis most comprehensive and detailed account of syngnathid development to date suggests that convergent phenotypes (e.g. reduction and loss of the caudal fins), likely arose by distinct ontogenetic means in pipefish and seahorses. Comparison of the ontogenetic trajectories of S. typhle and H. erectus provides indications that characteristic features of the seahorse body plan result from developmental truncation. Altogether this work provides a valuable resource and framework for future research to understand the evolution of the outlandish syngnathid morphology from a developmental perspective.\n\nBullet pointsO_LISyngnathids (pipefish, pipe-horses and seahorses) are a highly derived and diverse fish taxon and many of their most iconic traits - and these traits variation across species - develop during their early ontogeny.\nC_LIO_LIThis study provides a detailed description and staging table of the entire pre-release development (and beyond) of three distinct syngnathids (two phylogenetically distinct pipefishes and a seahorse) with a focus on the skeletal elements forming the cranium, axial skeleton, appendages and the plate armor.\nC_LIO_LIThe data provided in this study suggests that developmental heterochrony, i.e. alterations in the rate and timing of developmental processes between lineages, might be a central evolutionary process shaping the morphological diversity found in syngnathids today.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Randomization tests are often used with species niche and distribution models to estimate model performance, test hypotheses, and measure methodological biases. Many of these tests involve building null models representing the hypothesis that there is no association between the species occurrences and the environmental predictors, then comparing the empirical model to null distributions built from these models. These null models are commonly based on points randomly selected with a uniform probability from the study area. However, spatial sampling bias, a near-universal feature of the occurrence data used to build niche and distribution models, results in a non-uniform probability of observing species in different areas even when species occurrences are unrelated to environmental predictors. Failing to account for this bias in randomization tests results in null distributions that do not accurately represent the null hypothesis, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions. In this study, we use simulations to demonstrate that uniform sampling in randomization tests can lead to unacceptable rates of type I error and poor estimates of methodological bias when spatial sampling bias is present in the occurrence data. We present a new method that incorporates a bias estimate into replicate simulations for these randomization tests, and show that this adjustment can reduce type I error rates to an acceptable level.",

    "abstract": "Functionally indispensable genes are likely to be retained and otherwise to be lost during evolution. This evolutionary fate of a gene can also be affected by neutral factors, including the mutability of genomic positions, but such features have not been examined well. To uncover the genomic features associated with gene loss, we investigated the characteristics of genomic regions where genes have been independently lost in multiple lineages. With a comprehensive scan of gene phylogenies of vertebrates with a careful inspection of evolutionary gene losses, we identified 1,081 human genes whose orthologs were lost in multiple mammalian lineages: designated  elusive genes. These elusive genes were located in genomic regions with rapid nucleotide substitution, high GC content, and high gene density. A comparison of the orthologous regions of such elusive genes across vertebrates revealed that these features had been established before the radiation of the extant vertebrates more than 500 million years ago. The association of human elusive genes with transcriptomic and epigenomic characteristics illuminated that the genomic regions containing such genes were subject to repressive transcriptional regulation. Thus, the heterogeneous genomic features driving gene fates toward loss have been in place since the ancestral vertebrates and may sometimes have relaxed the functional indispensability of such genes.",

    "abstract": "Olfaction is one of the evolutionarily oldest senses and plays a fundamental role in foraging and social interactions across mammals. In primates, the role of olfaction is now well recognized, but better investigated in strepsirrhine and platyrrhine primates than in catarrhine primate species. We therefore observed the sniffing behavior of semi-free ranging Barbary macaques, Macaca sylvanus, at Affenberg Salem, Germany, to assess how frequently macaques use olfaction and in which contexts, and how olfaction is affected by sex and age. Focal observations of 24 males and 24 females aged 1 to 25 years showed that Barbary macaques sniffed, on average, 5.3 times per hour, with more than 80% of sniffs directed at food. Irrespective of the context, younger individuals used olfaction more often than older ones. Females sniffed more often on food than males did, while males used olfaction more often in a social context than females did. Sniffs at conspecifics primarily occurred in a sexual context, with 70% of social sniffs directed at female anogenital swellings performed by males. Of the observed 176 anogenital inspections, 51 involved sniffing of the swelling. Olfactory inspections were followed by copulation significantly less often than merely visual inspections, suggesting that anogenital odors provided additional information guiding male mating decisions. In sum, results show that Barbary macaques routinely use olfaction during feeding, but also in a social context. Our study further suggests that odors may guide mating decisions, but the role of olfaction in sexual interactions warrants further investigations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany diseases may result from disrupted metabolic regulation. Metabolite-GWAS studies assess the association of polymorphic variants with metabolite levels in body fluids. While these studies are successful, they have a high cost and technical expertise burden due to combining the analytical biochemistry of metabolomics with the computational genetics of GWAS. Currently, there are 100s of standalone metabolomics and GWAS studies related to similar diseases or phenotypes. A method that could statically evaluate these independent studies to find novel metabolites-genes association is of high interest. Although such an analysis is limited to genes with known metabolite interactions due to the unpaired nature of the data sets, any discovered associations may represent biomarkers and druggable targets for treatment and prevention.\n\nMethodsWe developed a bioinformatics tool, metGWAS 1.0, that generates and statistically compares metabolic and genomic gene sets using a hypergeometric test. Metabolic gene sets are generated by mapping disease-associated metabolites to interacting proteins (genes) via online databases. Genomic gene sets are identified from a network representation of the GWAS Catalog comprising 100s of studies.\n\nResultsThe metGWAS 1.0 tool was evaluated using standalone metabolomics datasets extracted from two metabolomics-GWAS case studies. In case-study 1, a cardiovascular disease association study, we identified nine genes (APOA5, PLA2G5, PLA2G2D, PLA2G2E, PLA2G2F, LRAT, PLA2G2A, PLB1, and PLA2G7) that interact with metabolites in the KEGG glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway and contain polymorphic variants associated with cardiovascular disease (P < 0.005). The gene APOA5 was matched from the original metabolomics-GWAS study. In case study 2, a urine metabolome study of kidney metabolism in healthy subjects, we found marginal significance (P = 0.10 and P = 0.13) for glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathways to GWAS data relating to kidney disease.\n\nConclusionThe metGWAS 1.0 platform provides insight into developing methods that bridge standalone metabolomics and disease and phenotype GWAS data. We show the potential to reproduce findings of paired metabolomics-GWAS data and provide novel associations of gene variation and metabolite expression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRecent advances in long-read callers and assembly methods have greatly facilitated structural variants (SV) detection via read-based and assembly-based detection strategies. However, the lack of comparison studies, especially for SVs at complex genomic regions, complicates the selection of proper detection strategy for ever-increasing demand of SV analysis.\n\nResultsIn this study, we compared the two most widely-used strategies with six long-read datasets of HG002 genome and benchmarked them with well curated SVs at genomic regions of different complexity. First of all, our results suggest that SVs detected by assembly-based strategy are slightly affected by assemblers on HiFi datasets, especially for its breakpoint identity. Comparably, though read-based strategy is more versatile to different sequencing settings, aligners greatly affect SV breakpoints and type. Furthermore, our comparison reveals that 70% of the assembly-based calls are also detectable by read-based strategy and it even reaches 90% for SVs at high confident regions. While 60% of the assembly-based calls that are totally missed by read-based callers is largely due to the challenges of clustering ambiguous SV signature reads. Lastly, benchmarking with SVs at complex genomic regions, our results show that assembly-based approach outperforms read-based calling with at least 20X coverage, while read-based strategy could achieve 90% recall even with 5X coverage.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, with sufficient sequencing coverage, assembly-based strategy is able to detect SVs more consistently than read-based strategy under different settings. However, read-based strategy could detect SVs at complex regions with high sensitivity and specificity but low coverage, thereby suggesting its great potential in clinical application.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOngoing research of the mosquito microbiome aims to uncover novel strategies to reduce pathogen transmission. Sequencing costs, especially for metagenomics, are however still significant. A resource that is increasingly used to gain insights into host-associated microbiomes is the large amount of publicly available genomic data based on whole organisms like mosquitoes, which includes sequencing reads of the host-associated microbes and provides the opportunity to gain additional value of these initially host-focused sequencing projects.\n\nMethodsTo analyse non-host reads from existing genomic data, we developed a snakemake workflow called MINUUR (Microbial INsights Using Unmapped Reads). Within MINUUR, reads derived from the host-associated microbiome were extracted and characterised using taxonomic classifications and metagenome assembly followed by binning and quality assessment. We applied this pipeline to five publicly available Aedes aegypti genomic datasets, consisting of 62 samples with a broad range of sequencing depths.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that MINUUR recovers previously identified phyla and genera and is able to extract bacterial metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) associated to the microbiome. Of these MAGS, 42 are high-quality representatives with >90% completeness and <5% contamination. These MAGs improve the genomic representation of the mosquito microbiome and can be used to facilitate genomic investigation of key genes of interest. Furthermore, we show that samples with a high number of KRAKEN2 assigned reads produce more MAGs.\n\nConclusionsOur metagenomics workflow, MINUUR, was applied to a range of Aedes aegypti genomic samples to characterise microbiome-associated reads. We confirm the presence of key mosquito-associated symbionts that have previously been identified in other studies and recovered high-quality bacterial MAGs. In addition, MINUUR and its associated documentation are freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/aidanfoo96/MINUUR) and provide researchers with a convenient workflow to investigate microbiome data included in the sequencing data for any applicable host genome of interest.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are a major component of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton that play crucial roles in diverse cellular process. Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of tubulin dimers regulate the dynamics and organization of microtubules, as well as the interactions between microtubules and microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). One unique PTM that occurs on microtubules is the cyclical removal and re-addition of the C-terminal tyrosine of -tubulin. CAP-Gly (cytoskeleton-associated protein glycine-rich) domain containing proteins specifically recognize tyrosinated microtubules, a property exploited to regulate and spatially localize diverse microtubule effectors. KIF13B is a member of the long-distance transport kinesin-3 family, and the only kinesin motor that contains a conserved C-terminal CAP-Gly domain. What role the CAP-Gly domain plays in KIF13Bs motility along microtubules is unknown. Here, we investigated the interaction between KIF13Bs CAP-Gly domain, and the tyrosinated C-terminal tail domain of -tubulin. We found that KIF13Bs CAP-Gly domain strongly influences the initial motor-microtubule interaction, as well as the processive motility of KIF13B along microtubules. The effect of the CAP-Gly domain on kinesin-microtubule binding is specific to the nucleotide state of the motor domain, suggesting an interplay between the N-terminal motor domain and C-terminal CAP-Gly domain underlies the KIF13B-microtubule interaction. These results reveal that specialized kinesin tail domains play active roles in the initiation and continuation of motor movement.",

    "abstract": "Harmful algal blooms (HABs) produce neurotoxins that affect human health. Developmental exposure of zebrafish embryos to the HAB toxin domoic acid (DomA) causes myelin defects, loss of reticulospinal neurons, and behavioral deficits. However, it is unclear whether DomA primarily targets myelin sheaths, leading to the loss of reticulospinal neurons, or reticulospinal neurons, causing myelin defects. Here, we show that while exposure to DomA at 2 dpf did not reduce the number of oligodendrocyte precursors prior to myelination, it led to fewer myelinating oligodendrocytes that produced shorter myelin sheaths and aberrantly wrapped neuron cell bodies. DomA-exposed larvae lacked Mauthner neurons prior to the onset of myelination, suggesting that axonal loss is not secondary to myelin defects. The loss of the axonal targets may have led oligodendrocytes to inappropriately myelinate neuronal cell bodies. Consistent with this, GANT61, which reduces oligodendrocyte number, caused a reduction in aberrantly myelinated neuron cell bodies in DomA-exposed fish. Together, these results suggest that DomA initially alters reticulospinal neurons and the loss of axons causes aberrant myelination of nearby cell bodies. The identification of initial targets and perturbed cellular processes provides a mechanistic understanding of how DomA alters neurodevelopment, leading to structural and behavioral phenotypes.",

Trajectories of diffusing Piezo1 molecules, which exhibit confined Brownian diffusion on short timescales and hopping on long timescales, also reflect a bias towards the dimple. This bias can be explained by \"curvature coupling\" between the intrinsic curvature of the Piezo dome and the curvature of the red blood cell membrane.

    "abstract": "Intracellular transport is propelled by kinesin and cytoplasmic dynein motors that carry membrane-bound vesicles and organelles bidirectionally along microtubule tracks. Much is known about these motors at the molecular scale, but many questions remain regarding how kinesin and dynein cooperate and compete during bidirectional cargo transport at the cellular level. The goal of the present study was to use a stochastic stepping model constructed by using published load-dependent properties of kinesin-1 and dynein-dynactin-BicD2 (DDB) to identify specific motor properties that determine the speed, directionality, and transport dynamics of a cargo carried by one kinesin and one dynein motor. Model performance was evaluated by comparing simulations to recently published experiments of kinesin-DDB pairs connected by complementary oligonucleotide linkers. Plotting the instantaneous velocity distributions from kinesin-DDB experiments revealed a single peak centered around zero velocity. In contrast, velocity distributions from simulations displayed a central peak around 100 nm/s, along with two side peaks corresponding to the unloaded kinesin and DDB velocities. We hypothesized that frequent motor detachment events and relatively slow motor reattachment rates resulted in periods in which only one motor is attached. To investigate this hypothesis, we varied specific model parameters and compared the resulting instantaneous velocity distributions, and we confirmed this systematic investigation using a machine learning approach that minimized the residual sum of squares between the experimental and simulation velocity distributions. The experimental data were best recapitulated by a model in which the kinesin and dynein stall forces are matched, motor detachment rates are independent of load, and the kinesin-1 reattachment rate is 50 s-1. These results provide new insights into motor dynamics during bidirectional transport and put forth hypotheses that can be tested by future experiments.\n\nStatement of significanceBidirectional transport of vesicles along microtubules is vital for cellular function, particularly in the highly elongated axons and dendrites of neurons, and transport defects are linked to neurodegenerative diseases. For developing future therapeutic strategies, a better understanding is needed for how motors, cargo adapters, and accessory proteins coordinate their activities to transport cargo to their proper cellular locations. We approached this problem by simulating how antagonistic kinesin and dynein motors compete in pairs. We constrain our simulations by recent experimental results and conclude that the motors spend nearly all their time attached to the microtubule and competing against one another. This behavior is not predicted by existing single-molecule experiments and thus provides new insights into bidirectional transport.",

Transition between the CR and the Major ubiquitin conformations is critical for promoting mitochondrial degradation. The mechanisms by which the Major and CR conformations of Ser65-phosphorylated (pSer65) ubiquitin interconvert, however, have not yet been revealed. Here, we perform all-atom molecular dynamics simulations using the string method with swarms of trajectories to calculate the lowest free-energy path between these two conformers. Our analysis reveals the existence of a Bent intermediate in which the C-terminal residues of the {beta}5 strand shift to resemble the CR conformation, while pSer65 retains contacts resembling the Major conformation. This stable intermediate was reproduced in well-tempered metadynamics calculations, with the exception of a Gln2Ala mutant that disrupts contacts with pSer65. Lastly, dynamical network modelling reveals that the transition from the Major to CR conformations involves a decoupling of residues near pSer65 from the adjacent {beta}1 strand.",

    "abstract": "The Sec61 complex forms a protein-conducting channel in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane that is required for secretion of soluble proteins and production of many membrane proteins. Several natural and synthetic small molecules specifically inhibit the Sec61 channel, generating cellular effects that are potentially useful for therapeutic purposes, but their inhibitory mechanisms remain unclear. Here we present near-atomic-resolution structures of the human Sec61 channel inhibited by a comprehensive panel of structurally distinct small molecules-- cotransin, decatransin, apratoxin F, ipomoeassin F, mycolactone, cyclotriazadisulfonamide (CADA) and eeyarestatin I (ESI). Remarkably, all inhibitors bind to a common lipid-exposed pocket formed by the partially open lateral gate and plug domain of the channel. Mutations conferring resistance to the inhibitors are clustered at this binding pocket. The structures indicate that Sec61 inhibitors stabilize the plug domain of Sec61 in a closed state, thereby preventing the protein-translocation pore from opening. Our study reveals molecular interactions between Sec61 and its inhibitors in atomic detail and offers the structural framework for further pharmacological studies and drug design.",

    "abstract": "Unlike many signaling proteins that function as binary switches between  on and off states, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) exhibit basal activity that can be increased or decreased by numerous ligands. A given receptor can recognize multiple ligands, allosteric modulators, and transducers to create a complex free energy landscape. Many of the lowest energy states have been captured by static structural techniques while detailing the wells widths, metastable states, and the transition between them, is still in its infancy. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can monitor the structure and dynamics of GPCR ensembles across fifteen orders-of-magnitude, but technical challenges have limited its application to super-microsecond timescales. Focusing on a prototypical peptide-binding GPCR, the neurotensin receptor 1 (NTS1), we employed NMR and density functional theory (DFT) to probe global sub-nanosecond motions. The near random coil chemical shifts of the apo receptor produced a poor correlation with theoretical predictions that may indicate a high degree of conformational averaging in solution, a crystallization artifact, or both. Whereas orthosteric agonists and antagonists both rigidified the receptor, but to varying degrees, which suggests conformational entropy differentially contributes to their respective pharmacology. The strong correlations of observed and theoretical chemical shifts lend confidence to interpreting spectra in terms of local structure, methyl dihedral angle geometry, and pico-second timescale transitions. Together, our results suggest a role for sub-nanosecond dynamics and conformational entropy in GPCR ligand discrimination.",

    "abstract": "Many teaching websites, such as the Khan Academy, propose vivid videos illustrating a mathematical concept. Using fMRI, we asked whether watching such a video suffices to rapidly change the brain networks for mathematical knowledge. We capitalized on the finding that, when judging the truth of short spoken statements, distinct semantic regions activate depending on whether the statements bear on mathematical knowledge or on other domains of semantic knowledge. Here, participants answered such questions before and after watching a lively five-minute video which taught them the rudiments of a new domain. During the video, a distinct math-responsive network, comprising anterior intraparietal and inferior temporal nodes, showed inter-subject synchrony when viewing mathematics course rather than control courses in biology or law. However, this experience led to minimal subsequent changes in the activity of those domain-specific areas when answering questions on the same topics a few minutes later. All taught facts, whether mathematical or not, led to domain-general repetition enhancement, particularly prominent in the cuneus, posterior cingulate and posterior parietal cortices. We conclude that short videos do not suffice to induce a meaningful lasting change in the brains math-responsive network, but merely engage domain-general regions possibly involved in episodic short-term memory.\n\nSignificance StatementTeaching mathematical concepts is difficult. To facilitate the comprehension and appeal of mathematics, several teaching websites provide vivid videos illustrating math concepts. Here, however, we show that merely watching such videos fails to improve the brain networks for mathematics. During the video itself, these networks are transiently engaged - but a few minutes later, when we ask questions about the taught concepts, performance is only minimally improved, and the participants engage generic regions thought to be involved in short-memory and language, rather than the targeted math-responsive regions. Brief video watching is therefore insufficient as a pedagogical device, probably because it misses ingredients such as teacher-pupil interactions, explicit teaching, active engagement, retrieval practice, repetition, and sleep.",

    "abstract": "In episodic encoding, an unfolding experience is rapidly transformed into a memory representation that binds separate episodic elements into a memory form to be later recollected. However, it is unclear how brain activity changes over time to accommodate the encoding of incoming information. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of the representational format that contributed to memory formation of sequential episodes. We combined Representational Similarity Analysis and multivariate decoding approaches on EEG data to compare whether \"category-level\" or \"item-level\" representations supported memory formation during the online encoding of a picture triplet sequence and offline, in the period that immediately followed encoding. The findings revealed a gradual integration of category-level representation during the online encoding of the picture sequence and a rapid item-based neural reactivation of the encoded sequence at the episodic offset. However, we found that only memory reinstatement at episodic offset was associated with successful memory retrieval from long term memory. These results suggest that post-encoding memory reinstatement is crucial for the rapid formation of unique memory for episodes that unfold over time. Overall, the study sheds light on the dynamics of representational format changes that take place during the formation of episodic memories.",

    "abstract": "Progesterone and its receptors (PRs) participate in mating and reproduction, but their role in spatial declarative memory, is not understood. Male and female mice express PRs in regions that support spatial memory: the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. PRs were predominantly expressed in excitatory neurons in Pgr-Cre mice injected with AAV-delivered flexed tdTomato. Furthermore, segesterone, a specific PR agonist, activated neurons in the entorhinal cortex (EC) and the hippocampus. We assessed the PR function in these spatial memory circuit neurons by examining the performance of mice lacking this receptor (PRKO) in novel object recognition, object placement, and Y-maze alternation tasks. In the recognition test, wild-type littermates spent significantly more time exploring the new object than male PRKO mice. The EC-specific deletion of PRs was sufficient to induce a deficit in detecting familiar versus never experienced or new objects. We confirmed deficits in spatial memory of PRKO mice by testing them on the Y-maze forced alternation task. In contrast to spatial tasks, PR removal did not alter the response to fear conditioning. PRs also support spatial memory in female mice. These studies provide novel insights into the role of PR in facilitating spatial, declarative memory in males and females, which may help with finding reproductive partners.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBrain progesterone receptors play an essential role in facilitating mating and reproductive behaviors, but their role in spatial memory and, therefore, mate-finding is not described. Principal, excitatory neurons of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus express progesterone receptors. These receptors facilitate spatial memory in male and female mice, which may enhance mate-finding reproductive function and food foraging.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the causal agent of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). There is an urgent need for potent, specific antiviral compounds against SARS-CoV-2. The 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is an essential enzyme for the replication of SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses, and thus is a target for coronavirus drug discovery. Nearly all inhibitors of coronavirus 3CLpro reported so far are covalent inhibitors. Here, we report the development of specific, non-covalent inhibitors of 3CLpro. The most potent one, WU-04, effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 replications in human cells with EC50 values in the 10-nM range. WU-04 also inhibits the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with high potency, indicating that it is a pan-inhibitor of coronavirus 3CLpro. WU-04 showed anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity similar to that of PF-07321332 (Nirmatrelvir) in K18-hACE2 mice when the same dose was administered orally. Thus, WU-04 is a promising drug candidate for coronavirus treatment.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA oral non-covalent inhibitor of 3C-like protease effectively inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication.",

    "abstract": "Variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) challenge currently available COVID-19 vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies through epitope change on the receptor binding domain of the viral spike glycoprotein. Hence, there is a specific urgent need for alternative antivirals that target processes less likely to be affected by mutation, such as the membrane fusion step of viral entry into the host cell. One such antiviral class includes peptide inhibitors which block formation of the so-called HR1HR2 six-helix bundle of the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and thus interfere with viral membrane fusion. Here we performed structural studies of the HR1HR2 bundle, revealing an extended, well-folded N-terminal region of HR2 that interacts with the HR1 triple helix. Based on this structure, we designed an extended HR2 peptide that achieves single-digit nanomolar inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in cell-based fusion, VSV-SARS-CoV-2 chimera, and authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection assays without the need for modifications such as lipidation or chemical stapling. The peptide also strongly inhibits all major SARS-CoV-2 variants to date. This extended peptide is ~100-fold more potent than all previously published short, unmodified HR2 peptides, and it has a very long inhibition lifetime after washout in virus infection assays, suggesting that it targets a pre-hairpin intermediate of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Together, these results suggest that regions outside the HR2 helical region may offer new opportunities for potent peptide-derived therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 and its variants, and even more distantly related viruses, and provide further support for the pre-hairpin intermediate of the S protein.\n\nSignificance StatementSARS-CoV-2 infection requires fusion of viral and host membranes, mediated by the viral spike glycoprotein (S). Due to the importance of viral membrane fusion, S has been a popular target for developing vaccines and therapeutics. We discovered a simple peptide that inhibits infection by all major variants of SARS-CoV-2 with nanomolar efficacies. In marked contrast, widely used shorter peptides that lack a key N-terminal extension are about 100 x less potent than this peptide. Our results suggest that a simple peptide with a suitable sequence can be a potent and cost-effective therapeutic against COVID-19 and they provide new insights at the virus entry mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is a primary driver of the COVID-19 pandemic. While existing interventions prevent severe disease, they exhibit mixed efficacy in preventing transmission, presumably due to their limited antiviral effects in the respiratory mucosa, whereas interventions targeting the sites of viral replication might more effectively limit respiratory virus transmission. Recently, intranasally administered RNA-based therapeutic interfering particles (TIPs) were reported to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication, exhibit a high barrier to resistance, and prevent serious disease in hamsters. Since TIPs intrinsically target the tissues with the highest viral replication burden (i.e., respiratory tissues for SARS-CoV-2), we tested the potential of TIP intervention to reduce SARS-CoV-2 shedding. Here, we report that a single, post-exposure TIP dose lowers SARS-CoV-2 nasal shedding and at 5 days post-infection infectious virus shed is below detection limits in 4 out of 5 infected animals. Furthermore, TIPs reduce shedding of Delta variant or WA-1 from infected to uninfected hamsters. Co-housed  contact animals exposed to infected, TIP-treated, animals exhibited significantly lower viral loads, reduced inflammatory cytokines, no severe lung pathology, and shortened shedding duration compared to animals co-housed with untreated infected animals. TIPs may represent an effective countermeasure to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n\nSignificanceCOVID-19 vaccines are exceptionally effective in preventing severe disease and death, but they have mixed efficacy in preventing virus transmission, consistent with established literature that parenteral vaccines for other viruses fail to prevent mucosal virus shedding or transmission. Likewise, small-molecule antivirals, while effective in reducing viral-disease pathogenesis, also appear to have inconsistent efficacy in preventing respiratory virus transmission including for SARS-CoV-2. Recently, we reported the discovery of a single-administration antiviral Therapeutic Interfering Particle (TIP) against SARS-CoV-2 that prevents severe disease in hamsters and exhibits a high genetic barrier to the evolution of resistance. Here, we report that TIP intervention also reduces SARS-CoV-2 transmission between hamsters.",

Their ancestral history, geographical isolation, stratified community composition and interspecies dynamics make them an interesting model to study community ecological processes and concepts. In this study, we analyzed different metagenomic datasets from worldwide modern microbial mats to compare community structure and functions. We found significant differentiation in both alpha and beta diversity of taxonomic and functional categories without significant correlation with temperature and pH. Differences depended more on the presence of very highly abundant cyanobacteria and some generalist microorganisms. Our results suggest that there is more than just Grinnellian niche dynamics in the determination of microbial mat community assembly, opening the hypothesis of interactions as the driver behind these ancient communities. We also discuss the influence of niche dynamics and environmental filtering in the community assembly of microbial mats.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundParasites are integral parts of ecosystem function and important drivers of evolutionary processes. Characterising ectoparasite diversity is fundamental to studies of host-parasite interactions, evolution, and conservation, and also for understanding emerging disease threats for some vector borne pathogens. With more than 1,400 species, bats represent the second most speciose mammalian clade, but their ectoparasite fauna are poorly known for most species.\n\nMethodsWe sequenced mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase C subunit I and nuclear 18S ribosomal gene fragments, and used Bayesian phylogenetic analyses to characterise ectoparasite taxon identity and diversity for 17 species of parasitized bats sampled along the Baja California peninsula and in Northwestern Mexico.\n\nResultsThe sequence data revealed multiple novel lineages of bat bugs (Cimicidae), flies (Nycteribiidae and Streblidae) and ticks (Argasidae). Within families, the new linages showed more than 10% sequence divergence, which is consistent with separation at least at the species level. Both families of bat flies showed host specificity, particularly on Myotis species. We also identified new records for the Baja peninsula of one tick (Carios kelleyi), and of five Streblid bat flies. One Nycteribiid bat fly haplotype from Pallid bat (Antrozous pallidus) hosts was found throughout the peninsula, suggesting potential long distance co-dispersal with hosts. Different bat bug and tick communities were found in the north and south of the peninsula.\n\nConclusionsThis study is the first systematic survey of bat ectoparasites in the Baja California peninsula, discovering highly genetically differentiated novel lineages compared to other parts of North America. For some ectoparasite species, haplotype distributions may reflect patterns of bat migration. This work is a first step in characterising ectoparasite diversity over the Baja California peninsula, and understanding how ecological and evolutionary interactions shape bat ectoparasite communities among host species in different parts of their ranges.",

    "abstract": "The human louse, Pediculus humanus, is an obligate blood-sucking ectoparasite that has coevolved with humans for millennia. Given the intimate relationship between this parasite and the human host, the study of human lice has the potential to shed light on aspects of human evolution that are difficult to interpret using other biological evidence. In this study, we analyzed the genetic variation in 274 human lice from 25 geographic sites around the world by using nuclear microsatellite loci and female-inherited mitochondrial DNA sequences. Nuclear genetic diversity analysis revealed the presence of two distinct genetic clusters I and II, which are subdivided into subclusters: Ia-Ib and IIa-IIb, respectively. Among these samples, we observed the presence of the two most common louse mitochondrial haplogroups: A and B that were found in both nuclear Clusters I and II. Evidence of nuclear admixture was uncommon (12%) and was predominate in the New World potentially mirroring the history of colonization in the Americas. These findings were supported by novel DIYABC simulations that were built using both host and parasite data to define parameters and models suggesting that admixture between cI and cII was very recent. This pattern could also be the result of a reproductive barrier between these two nuclear genetic clusters. In addition to providing new evolutionary knowledge about this human parasite, our study could guide the development of new analyses in other host-parasite systems.",

    "abstract": "Dramatic spatial, temporal and taxonomic variation in biodiversity is ultimately explained by differences in speciation and extinction rates. Mammals represent a [~]200 My old radiation that resulted in over 6500 extant species, with stark temporal, spatial and taxonomic heterogeneity in biodiversity. Throughout their history, every mammal lineage is expected to have undergone diversification rates that vary instantaneously in time resulting from the complex interplay of context-specific extrinsic factors (e.g., K-Pg mass extinction event, rise of angiosperms) with their evolving ecologies (e.g., body size, diet). When studying the diversification history of a clade, however, mathematical and computational limitations have hindered inference of such a flexible birth-death model where speciation and extinction rates evolve continuously along a phylogenetic tree. Here we overcome these challenges by implementing a series of phylogenetic models in which speciation and extinction rates are inherited and diffuse following a latent Geometric Brownian motion process. We enable full Bayesian inference using data augmentation techniques to sample from the posterior distribution of model parameters, including augmented phylogenetic trees and validate using simulations. Using a genome-informed time-calibrated tree for over 4000 Mammals species, we are able to estimate a complete and fine-grained picture of the variation in diversification rates that captures both global and lineage specific effects. We find that, contrary to the idea of a suppressed mammalian diversification before the K-Pg mass extinction event (i.e., explosive- or delayed-rise), mammal speciation rates dramatically increased around 10-20 My before the K-Pg. Our new model opens exciting possibilities in disentangling the drivers behind variation in diversification and assaying how small-scale processes scale-up to macroevolutionary dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Understanding phenotypic sex differences has long been a goal of biology from both a medical and evolutionary perspective. Although much attention has been paid to mean differences in phenotype between the sexes, little is known about sex differences in phenotypic variability. To gain insight into sex differences in inter-individual variability at the molecular level, we analyzed RNA-seq data from 43 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). Within each tissue, we identified genes that show sex differences in gene expression variability. We found that these sex-differentially variable (SDV) genes are associated with various important biological functions, including sex hormone response, immune response, and other signaling pathways. By analyzing single-cell RNA sequencing data collected from breast epithelial cells, we found that genes with sex differences in gene expression variability in breast tissue tend to be expressed in a cell-type-specific manner. We looked for an association between SDV expression and Graves disease, a well-known heavily female-biased disease, and found a significant enrichment of Graves associated genes among genes with higher variability in females in thyroid tissue. This suggests a possible role for SDV expression in the context of sex-biased disease. We then examined the evolutionary constraints acting on genes with sex differences in variability and found that they exhibit evidence of increased selective constraint. Through analysis of sex-biased eQTL data, we found evidence that SDV expression may have a genetic basis. Finally, we propose a simple evolutionary model for the emergence of sex-differentially variable expression from sex-specific constraints.",

    "abstract": "1AimThe common vole is a temperate rodent widespread across Europe. It was also one of the most abundant small mammal species throughout the Late Pleistocene. Phylogeographic studies of its extant populations suggested the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 26.5-19 ka ago) as one of the main drivers of the species population dynamics. However, analyses based solely on extant genetic diversity may not recover the full complexity of past population history. The main aim of this study was to investigate the evolutionary history and identify the main drivers of the common vole population dynamics during the Late Pleistocene.\n\nLocationEurope\n\nTaxonCommon vole (Microtus arvalis)\n\nMethodsWe generated a dataset comprising 4.2 kb-long fragment of mitochondrial DNA from 148 ancient and 51 modern specimens sampled from multiple localities across Europe and covering the last 60 thousand years (ka). We used Bayesian inference to reconstruct their phylogenetic relationships and to estimate the age of specimens that were not directly dated.\n\nResultsWe estimate the time to the most recent common ancestor of all Last Glacial and extant common vole lineages to 90 ka ago and the divergence of the main mtDNA lineages present in extant populations to between 55 and 40 ka ago, earlier than previous estimates. We find multiple lineage turnovers in Europe in the period of high climate variability at the end of Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3; 57-29 ka ago) in addition to those found previously around the Pleistocene/Holocene transition. Conversely, data from the Western Carpathians suggest continuity throughout the LGM even at high latitudes.\n\nMain conclusionsOur results suggest that the main factor affecting the common vole populations during the last glacial period was the reduction of open habitats during the interstadial periods while the climate deterioration during the LGM had little impact on species population dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The amyloid-tau-neurodegeneration (ATN) framework has led to an increased focus on Alzheimers disease (AD) biomarkers. The cost and invasiveness of obtaining biomarkers via cerebrospinal fluid has motivated efforts to develop sensitive blood-based biomarkers. Although AD is highly heritable, the biometric genetic and environmental etiology of blood-based biomarkers has never been explored. We therefore, analyzed plasma beta-amyloid (A{beta}40, A{beta}42, A{beta}42/40), total tautau (t-tautau), and neurofilament light (NFL) biomarkers in a sample of 1,050 men aged 60 to 73 years (m=68.2, SD=2.5) from the Vietnam Era Twin Study of Aging (VETSA). Unlike A{beta} and tautau, NFL does not define AD; however, as a biomarker of neurodegeneration it serves as the N component in the ATN framework. Univariate estimates suggest that familial aggregation in A{beta}42, A{beta}42/40, t-tau, and NFL is entirely explained by additive genetic influences accounting for 40%-58% of the total variance. All remaining variance is associated with unshared or unique environmental influences. For A{beta}40, a additive genetic (31%), shared environmental (44%), and unshared environmental (25%) influences contribute to the total variance. In the more powerful multivariate analysis of A{beta}42, A{beta}40, t-tau, and NFL, heritability estimates range from 32% to 58%. A{beta}40 and A{beta}42 are statistically genetically identical (rg = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.92,1.00) and are also moderately environmentally correlated (re = 0.66, 95%CI = 0.59, 0.73). All other genetic and environmental associations were non-significant or small. Our results suggest that plasma biomarkers are heritable and that A{beta}40 and A{beta}42 share the same genetic influences, whereas the genetic influences on plasma t-tau and NFL are mostly unique and uncorrelated with plasma A{beta} in early old-age men.",

    "abstract": "Some of the most efficacious antiviral therapeutics are ribonucleos(t)ide analogs. The presence of a 3-to-5 proofreading exoribonuclease (ExoN) in coronaviruses diminishes the potency of many ribonucleotide analogs. The ability to interfere with ExoN activity will create new possibilities for control of SARS-CoV-2 infection. ExoN is formed by a 1:1 complex of nsp14 and nsp10 proteins. We have purified and characterized ExoN using a robust, quantitative system that reveals determinants of specificity and efficiency of hydrolysis. Double-stranded RNA is preferred over single-stranded RNA. Nucleotide excision is distributive, with only one or two nucleotides hydrolyzed in a single binding event. The composition of the terminal basepair modulates excision. A stalled SARS-CoV-2 replicase in complex with either correctly or incorrectly terminated products prevents excision, suggesting that a mispaired end is insufficient to displace the replicase. Finally, we have discovered several modifications to the 3-RNA terminus that interfere with or block ExoN-catalyzed excision. While a 3-OH facilitates hydrolysis of a nucleotide with a normal ribose configuration, this substituent is not required for a nucleotide with a planar ribose configuration such as that present in the antiviral nucleotide produced by viperin. Design of ExoN-resistant, antiviral ribonucleotides should be feasible.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome of vertebrates is capable of numerous biotransformations of bile acids, which are responsible for intestinal lipid digestion and function as key nutrient-signaling molecules. The human liver produces bile acids from cholesterol predominantly in the A/B-trans orientation in which the sterol rings are \"kinked\", as well as small quantities of A/B-cis oriented \"flat\" stereoisomers known as \"primary allo-bile acids\". While the complex multi-step bile acid 7-dehydroxylation pathway has been well-studied for conversion of \"kinked\" primary bile acids such as cholic acid (CA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) to deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA), respectively, the enzymatic basis for the formation of \"flat\" stereoisomers allo-deoxycholic acid (allo-DCA) and allo-lithocholic acid (allo-LCA) by Firmicutes has remained unsolved for three decades. Here, we present a novel mechanism by which Firmicutes generate the \"flat\" bile acids allo-DCA and allo-LCA. The BaiA1 was shown to catalyze the final reduction from 3-oxo-allo-DCA to allo-DCA and 3-oxo-allo-LCA to allo-LCA. Phylogenetic and metagenomic analyses of human stool samples indicate that BaiP and BaiJ are encoded only in Firmicutes and differ from membrane-associated bile acid 5-reductases recently reported in Bacteroidetes that indirectly generate allo-LCA from 3-oxo-{Delta}4-LCA. We further map the distribution of baiP and baiJ among Firmicutes in human metagenomes, demonstrating an increased abundance of the two genes in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients relative to healthy individuals.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBile acid synthesis by vertebrates is central to digestion and nutrient signaling. Gut bacteria have evolved enzymes capable of converting primary bile acids to hundreds of secondary bile acids. While bile acid microbiology has been focused on the metabolism of ring hydroxyl groups and the carboxylated side-chain, very little is known about how bacteria alter the shape of the steroid ring system. Here, we describe enzymes expressed by Firmicutes that convert the \"kinked\" primary bile acid into \"flat\" secondary bile acids. Decades of research indicate that increased levels of secondary bile acids are risk factors for colorectal cancer. Hidden Markov Models developed from the BaiP and BaiJ enzyme sequences revealed significant enrichment in metagenomes of subjects with colorectal cancer.",

In this study an automatic process is presented, aiming to segment all lower limb muscles from Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging data simultaneously using three-dimensional (3D) deformable image registration. Twenty-three of the major lower limb skeletal muscles were segmented from five subjects, with an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.72, and average absolute relative volume error of 12.7% (average relative volume error of -2.2%) considering the optimal subject combinations. Segmented MR imaging datasets of the lower limb are not widely available in the literature, limiting the potential of new, probabilistic methods such as deep learning to be used in the context of muscle segmentation. In this work, Non-linear deformable image registration is used to generate 69 manually checked, segmented, 3D, artificial datasets, allowing access for future studies to use these new methods, with a large amount of reliable reference data.",

    "abstract": "The Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development (ABCD) study aims to measure the trajectories of brain, cognitive, and emotional development. Cognitive and behavioural development during late childhood and adolescence have been associated with a myriad of microstructural and morphological alterations across the brain, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These associations may be strongly localised or spatially diffuse, therefore, it would be advantageous to analyse multimodal MRI data in concert, and across the whole brain. The ABCD study presents the unique challenge of integrating multimodal data from tens of thousands of scans at multiple timepoints, within a reasonable computation time. To address the need for a multimodal registration and atlas for the ABCD dataset, we present the synthesis of an ABCD atlas using the Multimodal Image Normalisation Tool (MINT). The MINT ABCD atlas was generated from baseline and two-year follow up imaging data using an iterative approach to synthesise a cohort-specific atlas from linear and nonlinear deformations of eleven channels of diffusion and structural MRI data. We evaluated the performance of MINT against two widely used methods and show that MINT achieves comparable alignment to current state-of-the-art multimodal registration, at a fraction of the computation time. To validate the use of the ABCD MINT atlas in whole brain, voxelwise analysis, we replicate and expand on previously published region-of-interest analysis between diffusion MRI-derived measures and body mass index (BMI). We also report novel association between BMI and brain morphology derived from the registration deformations. We present the ABCD MINT atlas as a publicly available resource to facilitate whole brain voxelwise analyses for the ABCD study.",

Extinction training only temporarily suppresses fear memories in adults, but it is highly effective in juveniles. GABAergic parvalbumin-positive (PV+) cells restrict plasticity in adult brains, thus increasing PV+ cell plasticity could promote the suppression of fear memories following extinction training in adults. Histone deacetylase 2 (Hdac2) restrains both structural and functional synaptic plasticity; however, whether and how Hdac2 controls adult PV+ cell plasticity is unknown. Here, we report that Hdac2 deletion or pharmacological inhibition in PV+ cells attenuate spontaneous recovery of fear memory after fear extinction learning in adults. These manipulations promote a temporally restricted downregulation of Acan, a critical perineuronal net component expressed exclusively by PV+ cells in medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, we show that Acan transient downregulation before extinction training but after fear memory acquisition is sufficient to reduce spontaneous fear memory recovery in wild-type mice.",

A polymorphism in FAAH (FAAH C385A) reduces FAAH expression, increases anandamide levels, and increases the risk of obesity. Nevertheless, some studies have found no association between FAAH C385A and obesity. We investigated whether the environmental context governs the impact of FAAH C385A on metabolic outcomes. Using a C385A knock-in mouse model, we found that under basal conditions, there was no effect of the FAAH C385A polymorphism on body weight or composition. By contrast, FAAH A/A mice are more susceptible to glucocorticoid-induced hyperphagia, weight gain, and activation of hypothalamic AMPK. AMPK inhibition occluded the amplified hyperphagic response to glucocorticoids in FAAH A/A mice. FAAH knockdown exclusively in AgRP neurons mimicked the exaggerated feeding response of FAAH A/A mice to glucocorticoids. FAAH A/A mice likewise presented exaggerated orexigenic responses to ghrelin, while FAAH knockdown in AgRP neurons blunted leptin anorectic responses. Together, the FAAH A/A genotype amplifies orexigenic responses and decreases anorexigenic responses, providing a putative mechanism explaining the diverging human findings.",

Here, we used this population to systematically characterize cell density and volume for each anatomical unit in the mouse brain. We developed a deep neural network-based segmentation pipeline that uses the auto-fluorescence intensities of images to segment cell nuclei even within the densest regions, such as the dentate gyrus. We applied our pipeline to 537 brains of males and females from C57BL/6J and FVB.CD1 strains. Globally, we found that increased overall brain volume does not result in uniform expansion across all regions. Moreover, region-specific density changes are often negatively correlated with the volume of the region, therefore cell count does not scale linearly with volume. Many regions, including layer 2/3 across several cortical areas, showed distinct lateral bias. We identified the greatest strain-specific or sex-specific differences in the medial amygdala (MEA), bed nuclei (BST), lateral septum and olfactory system (e.g., MOB, AOB, TR) and prefrontal areas (e.g., ORB) - yet, inter-individual variability was always greater than the effect size of a single qualifier. We provide the results of this analysis as an accessible resource for the community.",

    "abstract": "Yeast display can serve as a powerful tool to assess peptide-MHC (pMHC) and pMHC-TCR binding. However, this approach is often limited by the need to optimize MHC proteins for yeast surface expression, which can be laborious and may not yield productive results. Here we present a second-generation yeast display platform for class II MHC molecules (MHC-II) which decouples MHC-II expression from yeast-expressed peptides, referred to as \"peptide display\". Peptide display obviates the need for yeast-specific MHC optimizations and increases the scale of MHC-II alleles available for use in yeast display screens. Because MHC identity is separated from the peptide library, a further benefit of this platform is the ability to assess a single library of peptides against any MHC-II. We demonstrate the utility of the peptide display platform across MHC-II proteins, screening HLA-DR, HLA-DP, and HLA-DQ alleles. We further explore parameters of selections, including reagent dependencies, MHC avidity, and use of competitor peptides. This approach presents an advance in throughput and accessibility of screening peptide-MHC-II binding.",

    "abstract": "Nontyphoidal strains of Salmonella enterica are a major cause of foodborne illnesses and infection with these bacteria result in inflammatory gastroenteritis. Neutrophils are a dominant immune cell type found at the site of infection in Salmonella-infected individuals, but how they regulate infection outcome is not well understood. Here we used a co-culture model of primary human neutrophils and human intestinal organoids to probe the role of neutrophils during infection with two of the most prevalent Salmonella serovars: Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Typhimurium. Using a transcriptomics approach, we identified a dominant role for neutrophils in mounting differential immune responses including production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides. We also identified specific gene sets that are induced by neutrophils in response to Enteritidis or Typhimurium infection. By comparing host responses to these serovars, we uncovered differential regulation of host metabolic pathways particularly induction of cholesterol biosynthetic pathways during Typhimurium infection and suppression of RNA metabolism during Enteritidis infection. Together these findings provide insight into the role of human neutrophils in modulating different host responses to pathogens that cause similar disease in humans.\n\nImportanceNontyphoidal serovars of Salmonella enterica are known to induce robust neutrophil recruitment in the gut during early stages of infection, but the specific role of neutrophils in regulating infection outcome of different serovars is poorly understood. Due to differences in human infection progression compared to small animal models, characterizing the role of neutrophils during infection has been challenging. Here we used a co-culture model of human intestinal organoids with human primary neutrophils to study the role of neutrophils during infection of human intestinal epithelium. Using a transcriptomics approach, we define neutrophil-dependent reprogramming of the host response to Salmonella, establishing a clear role in amplifying pro-inflammatory gene expression. Additionally, the host response driven by neutrophils differed between two similar nontyphoidal Salmonella serovars. These findings highlight the importance of building more physiological infection models to replicate human infection conditions to study host responses specific to individual pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Diversity can be partitioned in several components and dimensions that are affected in different ways by habitat loss and fragmentation. However, these partitions and dimensions are rarely investigated on human-modified landscapes. In this study, we investigated different partitions (Hill numbers) and dimensions (taxonomic [T{beta}D], functional [F{beta}D] and phylogenetic [P{beta}D]) of small mammal {beta}-diversity in a fragmented landscape of central Brazil using a multi-scale approach. T{beta}D was estimated considering rare, common and abundant species. Tolerance to disturbed habitat, assessed via the traits \"habitat use\", \"tail length\" and \"use of vertical strata\", and trophic guild, defined by the \"diet\", were used to estimate F{beta}D. P{beta}D was based on phylogenetic relatedness of the sampled species. The association between different partitions and dimensions of {beta}-diversity with habitat and landscape attributes were investigated using Mantel tests. We found a significant positive effect of geographical distance on all partitions and dimensions of {beta}-diversity. NDVI was the second most important variable affecting abundance based T{beta}D, and all phylogenetic and functional {beta}-diversity dimensions. Habitat characteristics, such as fallen logs and canopy cover were positively associated with all {beta}-diversity dimensions. Our findings support the hypothesis that even in a highly modified landscape, small mammals {beta}-diversity is determined by different environmental factors and spatial disposition of forest patches. However, the relatively higher importance of space appears to be related to dispersal limitation of this group.",

    "abstract": "Interactions among plant species in extreme ecological systems are often inferred from spatial associations and quantified by means of paired sampling. Yet, this method might be confounded by habitat-sharing effects, in particular when microenvironmental heterogeneity and stress are high. Here, we address whether paired and random sampling methods provide similar results at varying levels of environmental heterogeneity. Furthermore, we investigate how the relationship between species preferences and abiotic severity influences the outcome of these two methods. We quantified spatial associations with the two methods at three sites that encompass different micro-environmental heterogeneity and stress levels: semi-arid environments in Canary Islands, Spain and Sardinia, Italy and a cold alpine environment in Hokkaido (Japan). Then, we simulated plant communities with different levels of species micro-habitat preferences, environmental heterogeneity and stress levels. We found that differences in species associations between paired and random sampling were indistinguishable from zero in our model simulations. At each site, there were strong differences between beneficiary species in their spatial association with benefactor species, and associations became more positive with increasing stress in Spain. Most importantly, there were no differences in the results yielded by the two methods at any of the different stress levels at the Spanish and Japanese sites. At the Italian site, although micro-environmental heterogeneity was low, we found weakly significant differences between methods that were unlikely due to habitat-sharing effects. We conclude that the paired sampling method can provide significant insights into net, long-term effects of plant interactions in spatially conspicuous environments.",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia is a maternally-inherited bacteria, which can spread rapidly in populations by manipulating reproduction. CifA and CifB are genes found in Wolbachia phage that are responsible for cytoplasmic incompatibility, the most common type of Wolbachia reproductive interference. In this phenomenon, no viable offspring are produced when a male with both CifA and CifB (or just CifB in an alternative mechanism) mates with a female lacking CifA. Utilizing this feature, we propose new types of toxin-antidote gene drives that can be constructed with these genes. By using both mathematical and simulation models, we found that a drive containing CifA and CifB together create a confined drive with a moderate to high introduction threshold. When introduced separately, they act as a self-limiting drive. We observed that the performance of these drives is substantially influenced by various ecological parameters and drive characteristics. Extending our models to continuous space, we found that the drive individual release distribution has a critical impact on drive persistence. Our results suggest that these new types of drives based on Wolbachia transgenes are safe and flexible candidates for genetic modification of populations.",

The oriCs of hundreds of sequenced bacterial genomes have been annotated in their genome reports using Ori-Finder and the predicted results have been deposited in DoriC, a manually curated database of oriCs. This has facilitated large-scale data mining of functional elements in oriCs and strand-biased analysis. Here, we describe Ori-Finder 2022 with updated prediction framework, interactive visualization module, new analysis module, and user-friendly interface. More species-specific indicator genes and functional elements of oriCs are integrated into the updated framework, which has also been redesigned to predict oriCs in draft genomes. The interactive visualization module displays more genomic information related to oriCs and their functional elements. The analysis module includes regulatory protein annotation, repeat sequence discovery, homologous oriC search, and strand-biased analyses. The redesigned interface provides additional customization options for oriC prediction.

Much of biology functions at the nanoscale, and our ability to manipulate materials and engage biological machinery in a purposeful manner requires knowledge of nano-bio interfaces. While several protein-protein interaction models are available, they leverage protein-specific information, limiting their abstraction to other structures. Here, we present NeCLAS, a general, and rapid machine learning pipeline that predicts the location of nanoscale interactions, providing human-intelligible predictions. Two key aspects distinguish NeCLAS: coarsegrained representations, and the use of environmental features to encode the chemical neighborhood. We showcase NeCLAS with challenges for protein-protein, protein-nanoparticle and nanoparticle-nanoparticle systems, demonstrating that NeCLAS replicates computationally- and experimentally-observed interactions. NeCLAS outperforms current nanoscale prediction models and it shows cross-domain validity. We anticipate that our framework will contribute to both basic research and rapid prototyping and design of diverse nanostructures in nanobiotechnology.",

    "abstract": "ADPKD has few therapeutic options. Tolvaptan slows disease but has side effects limiting its tolerability. Bempedoic acid (BA), an ATP citrate-lyase (ACLY) inhibitor FDA-approved for hypercholesterolemia, catalyzes a key step in fatty acid/sterol synthesis important for cell proliferation. BA is activated by very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (FATP2) expressed primarily in kidney and liver. BA also activates AMPK. We hypothesized that BA could be a novel ADPKD therapy by inhibiting cyst growth, proliferation, injury, and metabolic dysregulation via ACLY inhibition and AMPK activation. Pkd1-null kidney cell lines derived from mouse proximal tubule (PT) and collecting duct (IMCD) were grown in 2D or 3D Matrigel cultures and treated {+/-} BA, {+/-} SB-204990 (another ACLY inhibitor) or with Acly shRNA before cyst analysis, immunoblotting or mitochondrial assays using MitoSox and MitoTracker staining. Pkd1fl/fl;Pax8-rtTA;Tet-O-Cre C57BL/6J mice were induced with doxycycline injection on postnatal days 10 and 11 (P10-P11) and then treated {+/-} BA (30 mg/kg/d) {+/-} tolvaptan (30-100 mg/kg/d) by gavage from P12-21. Disease severity was determined by % total-kidney-weight-to-bodyweight (%TKW/BW) and BUN levels at euthanasia (P22). Kidney and liver homogenates were immunoblotted for expression of key biomarkers. ACLY expression and activity were upregulated in Pkd1-null PT and IMCD-derived cells vs. controls. Relative to controls, both BA and SB-204990 inhibited cystic growth in Pkd1-null kidney cells, as did Acly knockdown. BA inhibited mitochondrial superoxide production and promoted mitochondrial elongation, suggesting improved mitochondrial function. In ADPKD mice, BA reduced %TKW/BW and BUN to a similar extent as tolvaptan vs. untreated controls. Addition of BA to tolvaptan caused a further reduction in %TKW/BW and BUN vs. tolvaptan alone. BA generally reduced ACLY and stimulated AMPK activity in kidneys and livers vs. controls. BA also inhibited mTOR and ERK signaling and reduced kidney injury markers. In liver, BA treatment, both alone and together with tolvaptan, increased mitochondrial biogenesis while inhibiting apoptosis. We conclude that BA and ACLY inhibition inhibited cyst growth in vitro, and BA decreased ADPKD severity in vivo. Combining BA with tolvaptan further improved various ADPKD disease parameters. Repurposing BA may be a promising new ADPKD therapy, having beneficial effects alone and along with tolvaptan.",

    "abstract": "Carotenoids are plastidial isoprenoids required for photosynthesis and production of hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) in all plants. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), carotenoids also provide color to flowers and ripe fruit. Phytoene synthase (PSY) catalyzes the first and main flux-controlling step of the carotenoid pathway. Three PSY isoforms are present in tomato, PSY1 to 3. Mutants have shown that PSY1 is the isoform providing carotenoids for fruit pigmentation but it is dispensable in photosynthetic tissues. No mutants are available for PSY2 or PSY3, but their expression profiles suggest a main role for PSY2 in leaves and PSY3 in roots. To further investigate isoform specialization with genetic tools, we created tomato edited lines defective in PSY1 and PSY2 in the MicroTom background. The albino phenotype of lines lacking both PSY1 and PSY2 confirmed that PSY3 does not contribute to carotenoid biosynthesis in shoot tissues. Our work further shows that carotenoid production in tomato shoots relies on both PSY1 and PSY2 but with different contributions in different tissues. PSY2 is the main isoform for carotenoid biosynthesis in leaf chloroplasts, but the supporting role of PSY1 is particularly important under high light. PSY2 also contributes to the production of carotenoids in flower petals and, to a lower extent, fruit chromoplasts. Most interestingly, our results demonstrate that fruit growth and ripening is controlled by ABA produced in the pericarp from PSY1-derived precursors whereas PSY2 provides precursors for ABA synthesis in seeds to control germination.",

    "abstract": "Vegetative and reproductive phase change and phenology are economically and ecologically important traits. Trees typically require several years of growth before flowering and once mature, seasonal control of the transition to flowering and flower development is necessary to maintain vegetative meristems and for reproductive success. Members of two related gene subfamilies, FLOWERING LOCUST (FT) and TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1)/CENTRORADIALIS (CEN)/BROTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (BFT), have antagonistic roles in flowering in diverse species and roles in vegetative phenology in trees, but many details of their functions in trees have yet to be resolved. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate single and double mutants involving the five Populus FT and TFL1/CEN/BFT genes. ft1 mutants exhibited wild-type-like phenotypes in long days and short days, but after chilling to release dormancy showed delayed bud flush and GA3 could compensate for the ft1 mutation. After rooting and generating some phytomers in tissue culture, both cen1 and cen1ft1 mutants produced terminal as well as axillary flowers, indicating that the cen1 flowering phenotype is independent of FT1. Some axillary meristems initially generated phytomers and in potted plants, the timing of flowering in these shoots correlated with upregulation of FT2 in maturing leaves, suggesting that, in long days, CEN1 antagonizes FT2 promotion of flowering but enables FT2 promotion of shoot growth by maintaining indeterminacy of the shoot apical meristem. CEN1 showed distinct circannual expression patterns in vegetative and reproductive tissues and comparison with the expression patterns of FT1 and FT2 suggest that the relative levels of CEN1 compared to FT1 and FT2 regulate multiple phases of vegetative and reproductive seasonal development.",

    "abstract": "In plants, timely degeneration of tapetal cells is essential for providing nutrients and other substances to support pollen development. Rapid alkalinization factors (RALFs) are small, cysteine-rich peptides known to be involved in various aspects of plant development and growth, and defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. However, the functions of most of them remain unknown, while no RALF has been reported to involve in tapetum degeneration. In this study, we demonstrated that a novel cysteine-rich peptide EaF82 isolated from shy-flowering  Golden Pothos plants is a RALF-like peptide and displays alkalinizing activity. Its heterologous expression in Arabidopsis delayed tapetum degeneration and reduced pollen production and seed yields. RNAseq, RT-qPCR and biochemical analyses showed that overexpressing EaF82 down-regulated a group of genes involved in pH changes, cell wall modifications, tapetum degeneration and pollen maturation as well as seven endogenous Arabidopsis RALF genes, and decreased proteasome activity and ATP levels. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified AKIN10, a subunit of energy-sensing SnRK1 kinase, to be its interacting partner. Our study reveals a possible regulatory role for RALF peptide in tapetum degeneration and suggests that EaF82 action may be mediated through AKIN10 leading to the alteration of transcriptome and energy metabolism, thereby causing ATP deficiency and impairing pollen development.",

    "abstract": "Jasmonates (JAs) are phytohormones that finely regulate critical biological processes, including plant development and defense. JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins are crucial keeping JA-responsive genes in a repressed state. In the presence of JA-Ile, JAZ repressors are ubiquitinated and targeted for degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system, allowing the activation of the downstream transcription factors and, consequently, the activation of JA-responsive genes. A growing body of evidence has shown that JA signalling is crucial in defending against plant viruses and their insect vectors. Here, we describe the interaction of C2 proteins from two geminiviruses from the genus Begomovirus, tomato yellow curl Sardinia virus (TYLCSaV) and tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), with the transcriptional repressor JAZ8 from Arabidopsis thaliana and its closest orthologue in tomato, SlJAZ9. Both JAZ and C2 proteins colocalize in the nucleus, forming discrete nuclear speckles. Overexpression of JAZ8 did not lead to altered responses to TYLCV infection; however, knock-down of JAZ8 favours the geminiviral infection in plants. Low levels of JAZ8 likely affect the viral infection specifically since JAZ8-silenced plants do not display developmental phenotypes nor present differences in their interaction with the viral insect vector. Our results show that JAZ8 interacts with geminiviral C2 proteins and exerts an anti-geminiviral effect.",

    "abstract": "Upon establishment of an infection, many plant pathogens induce an aqueous microenvironment in the extracellular space of their host, resulting in water-soaked lesions. In the case of Pseudomonas syringae (Pst), this is accomplished through the activity of water-soaking effectors that stimulate abscisic acid (ABA) production and signaling, which results in stomatal closure. This reduces transpiration and induces a microenvironment favorable for bacterial growth. Stomata are also highly sensitive to environmental conditions, including light and circadian rhythm. Here, we show that a period of darkness is required for water-soaking, and that a constant light regime abrogates the water-soaking activity of Pst effectors. Additionally, we show that constant light induces resistance against Pst and that this effect requires salicylic acid (SA). An increase in SA production upon infection under constant light did not affect effector-induced ABA signaling, but rather abrogated ABAs ability to induce stomatal closure. Indeed, under normal diurnal light regimes, application of a SA analog is sufficient to prevent the ability of the pathogen to induce stomatal closure and a water-rich niche in the apoplast. Our results provide a novel approach to interfering with a common virulence strategy, as well as providing a physiological mechanism by which SA functions in defense against certain pathogens.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPhotosynthesizing tissue of teak (Tectona grandis L. f.) foliage is damaged by a host-specific insect pest called leaf skeletonizer (Eutectona machaeralis Walker) that severely eclipses annual growth increment and carbon sequestration of natural populations and plantation of teak. Gene-assisted selection of relatively resistant teak clones may efficiently control the damage in the populations and plantations. The present investigation aimed to identify genetic variation associated with relative resistance in teak against the pest.\n\nMethodThe investigation was carried out on 106 teak plus tree clones assembled at the National Teak Germplasm Bank from the Indian meta-population of teak. Resistance data were obtained recording the ocular damage caused by the pest to teak accessions for four years. Genotyping of the teak accessions was performed with 21 co-dominant markers and marker-trait association mapping was performed confirming the genetic structure of the germplasm bank and linkage disequilibrium (LD) among the marker loci.\n\nResultsThe sampled teak accessions exhibited a low albeit highly admixed genetic structure (FST=0.07) and low level of LD (16.66%) among loci, making them suitable for high-resolution association analysis. A significant correlation (p[&le;]0.01, R2=0.67) was obtained between intra-specific heterozygosity and the relative resistance against the pest. A marker locus CCoAMT-1 representing the enzyme caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase of phenylpropanoid pathway was also found significantly (p[&le;]0.05) associated with the relative resistance against the pest explaining 6.6% of the phenotypic variation (R2=0.066) through positive effect (0.57) on the trait.\n\nConclusionsThe present work exhibited a significant correlation of intra-specific heterozygosity with relative resistance in teak against a pest. It is the first report on teak identifying genetic markers associated with relative resistance against the pest. The marker can be applied for the selection of resistant planting stock for breeding and commercial plantation.\n\nFurther investigation can be performed to understand the expression level polymorphism linked with the resistance applying next-generation sequencing approaches.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDExcess dopamine release in the dorsal striatum (DS) is linked to psychosis. Antipsychotics are thought to work for positive symptoms by blocking striatal D2 dopamine receptors, but they lack efficacy for the negative and cognitive symptoms. Further, broadly increasing dopamine release improves cognitive function. These observations fueled the dogma that excess dopamine is not involved in negative and cognitive symptoms, but this has never been tested with dopamine pathway specificity.\n\nMETHODSWe selectively re-expressed excitatory TRPV1 receptors in DS-projecting dopamine neurons of male and female Trpv1 knockout mice. We treated these mice with capsaicin (TRPV1 agonist) to selectively activate these neurons, validated this approach with fiber photometry, and assessed its effects on social and cognitive function. We combined this manipulation with antipsychotic treatment (haloperidol) and compared the pathway-specific manipulation to treatment with the non-selective dopamine releaser amphetamine.\n\nRESULTSSelectively activating DS-projecting dopamine neurons increased DS (but not cortical) dopamine release and increased locomotor activity. Surprisingly, this manipulation also impaired behavioral processes linked to negative and cognitive symptoms (social drive and working memory). Haloperidol normalized locomotion, only partially rescued working memory, and had no effect on social interaction. By contrast, amphetamine increased locomotion but did not impair social interaction or working memory.\n\nCONCLUSIONSExcess dopamine release, when restricted to the DS, causes behavioral deficits linked to negative and cognitive symptoms. Previous studies using non-selective approaches to release dopamine likely overlooked these contributions of excess dopamine to psychosis. Future therapies should address this disregarded role for excess striatal dopamine in the treatment-resistant symptoms of psychosis.",

    "abstract": "A frequently used paradigm to quantify endogenous pain modulation is offset analgesia, which is defined as a disproportionate large reduction in pain following a small decrease in a heat stimulus. The aim of this study was to determine whether suggestion influences the magnitude of offset analgesia in healthy participants. A total of 97 participants were randomized into three groups (hypoalgesic group, hyperalgesic group, control group). All participants received four heat stimuli (two constant trials and two offset trials) to the ventral, non-dominant forearm while they were asked to rate their perceived pain using a computerized visual analogue scale. In addition, electrodermal activity was measured during each heat stimulus. Participants in both intervention groups were given a visual and verbal suggestion about the expected pain response in an hypoalgesic and hyperalgesic manner. The control group received no suggestion. In all groups, significant offset analgesia was provoked, indicated by reduced pain ratings (p < 0.001) and enhanced electrodermal activity level (p < 0.01). A significant group difference in the magnitude of offset analgesia was found between the three groups (F[2,94] = 4.81, p < 0.05). Participants in the hyperalgesic group perceived significantly more pain than the hypoalgesic group (p = 0.031) and the control group (p < 0.05). However, the electrodermal activity data did not replicate this trend (p > 0.05). The results of this study indicate that suggestion can be effective to reduce but not increase endogenous pain modulation quantified by offset analgesia in healthy participants.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling has emerged as a key feature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and ECM fragments have been proposed as markers of clinical disease severity. Recent studies report increased protease activity in the gut microbiota of IBD patients. Nonetheless, the relationship between gut microbiota and ECM remodeling has remained unexplored. We hypothesized that members of the human gut microbiome can degrade host ECM, and that bacteria-driven remodeling, in turn, can enhance colonic inflammation. Through a variety of in vitro assays, we first confirmed that multiple bacterial species found in the human gut are capable of degrading specific ECM components. Clinical stool samples obtained from ulcerative colitis patients also exhibited higher levels of proteolytic activity in vitro compared to those of their healthy counterparts. Furthermore, culture supernatants from bacteria species capable of degrading human ECM accelerated inflammation in a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. Finally, we identified several of the bacterial proteases and carbohydrate degrading enzymes (CAZymes) potentially responsible for ECM degradation in vitro. Some of these protease families and CAZymes were also found in increased abundance in a metagenomic cohort of IBD. These results demonstrate that some commensal bacteria in the gut are indeed capable of degrading components of human ECM in vitro and suggest this proteolytic activity may be involved in the progression of IBD. A better understanding of the relationship between nonpathogenic gut microbes, host ECM, and inflammation could be crucial to unravel some of the mechanisms underlying host-bacteria interactions in IBD and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Caribbean octocorals have not suffered the decades long decline in abundance that has plagued reef-building scleractinian corals. Their success and the formation of octocoral forests has been attributed to their continuing recruitment to reef habitats. Assessing the processes controlling recruitment is essential to understanding the success of octocorals and predicting their future. Benthic grazers on coral reefs can facilitate the growth and recruitment of corals by reducing the abundance of competitive algal turfs and macroalgae or hinder corals through predation of coral tissue and recruits. We assessed the effects of grazing by fishes and the sea urchin Diadema antillarum and mesofaunal predation on octocoral recruitment in a series of manipulative experiments using varying grazer/predator exclusion and inclusion conditions in in situ and ex situ experiments. Exposure to fish and urchin grazing significantly reduced survival and recruitment of single-polyp octocorals, while turf-associated mesofauna did not significantly affect neither recruitment nor survival. We also found a positive relationship between octocoral recruitment and turf algae, a potential related response to the deleterious effect of grazing exposure. These data suggest that grazers and predators mediate the mortality bottleneck characteristic of recruitment. Thus, the declines in the abundance of grazing fishes and urchins throughout the Caribbean may have contributed to the increase in abundance of octocorals in the Caribbean, concurrent with the loss of scleractinians.",

Although thousands of manipulative functional response experiments show feeding rate saturation at high densities under controlled conditions, it is unclear how saturated feeding rates are at natural prey densities. The general degree of feeding rate saturation has important implications for the processes determining feeding rates and how they respond to changes in prey density. To address this, we linked two databases - one of functional response parameters and one on mass-abundance scaling - through prey mass to calculate a feeding rate saturation index. We find that: 1) feeding rates may commonly be unsaturated and 2) the degree of saturation varies with predator and prey taxonomic identities and body sizes, habitat, interaction dimension, and temperature. These results reshape our conceptualization of predator-prey interactions in nature and suggest new research on the ecological and evolutionary implications of unsaturated feeding rates.",

Like most appendicularians with cosmopolitan distributions, Oikopleura dioica Fol, 1872 is considered a single species worldwide based on morphological features that distinguish them from other appendicularians. Despite their abundance however, there are still only [~]70 described appendicularian species, compared with over 2,800 ascidian tunicates. Here we perform a molecular phylogenetic, morphological, and reproductive assessment of O. dioica specimens collected from the Ryukyu Archipelago, mainland Japan, and Europe. The specimens are morphologically very similar, with only detailed examination of the oikoplastic epithelium and quantitative measurements revealing minor distinguishing characteristics. Phylogenetic analyses of the ribosomal gene loci and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) gene strongly indicate that they form three separate genetic clades despite their morphological similarities. Finally, in vitro crosses between the Ryukyu and mainland Japanese specimens show total prezygotic reproductive isolation. Our results reveal that the current taxonomic O. dioica classification likely hides multiple cryptic species, highlighting the genetic diversity and complexity of their population structures. Cryptic organisms are often hidden under a single species name because their morphological similarities make them difficult to disinguish and their correct identification is fundamental to understanding Earths biodiversity. O. dioica is an attractive model to understand how morphological conservation can be maintained despite pronounced genetic divergence.",

The identification of sex-determining systems in amphibians, however, is often difficult as a vast majority consist of homomorphic sex chromosomes making them hard to distinguish. In this study, we used Diversity Array Technology sequencing (DArTseq) to identify the sex-determining system in the ornate burrowing frog from Australia, Platyplectrum ornatum. We applied DArTseq to 44 individuals, 19 males and 25 females, collected from two locations to develop sex-linked markers. Unexpectedly, these 44 individuals were classified into two distinct population clusters based on our SNP analyses, 36 individuals in cluster-1, and 8 individuals in cluster-2. We then performed sex-linkage analyses separately in each cluster. We identified 35 sex-linked markers from cluster-1, which were all associated with maleness. Therefore, P. ornatum cluster-1 is utilising a male heterogametic (XX/XY) sex-determining system. On the other hand, we identified 210 sex-linked markers from cluster-2, of which 89 were male specific, i.e., identifying XX/XY sex determining system and 111 were female specific, i.e., identifying ZZ/ZW sex determining system, suggesting existence of either male or female heterogametic sex determining system in cluster-2. We also performed cytogenetic analyses in 1 male and 1 female from cluster-1; however, we did not detect any visible differentiation between the X and Y sex chromosomes. We also mapped sex-linked markers from the two clusters against the P. ornatum genome and our comparative analysis indicated that the sex chromosomes in both clusters shared homologies to chromosome 10 (autosome) of Rana temporaria and ZWY sex chromosome of Xenopus tropicalis. It is plausible that the cluster-2 has a potential to be either male or female heterogamety in sex determination, requiring further investigation.",

Further, advances in DNA sequencing and bioinformatics workflows facilitated sophisticated genome-based methods for microbial taxonomy.

However, the accuracy of the 16S rRNA sequence-based species identification is limited by multiple copies of the gene and their higher sequence identity between closely related species. Availability of a large volume of bacterial whole-genome data provided an opportunity to develop comprehensive species-specific 16S rRNA reference libraries. With defined rules, we have concatenated four 16S rRNA gene copy variants to develop a species-specific reference library. Using this approach, species-specific 16S rRNA gene libraries were developed for four closely related Streptococcus species (S. gordonii, S. mitis, S. oralis, and S. pneumoniae). Sequence similarity and phylogenetic analysis of concatenated 16S rRNA copies yielded better resolution than single gene copy approaches. The approach is very effective to classify genetically related species, and it may reduce misclassification of bacterial species and genome assemblies.",

Extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, innervation, and vascularization are all important regulators of iWAT function, yet whether exercise training improves these structural components of iWAT is unknown. Using biochemical, imaging, and multi-omics analyses we find that 11-days of wheel running in male mice causes profound iWAT remodeling including decreased ECM deposition and increased vascularization and innervation. We identify adipose stem cells as the main contributors to training-induced ECM remodeling, determine that training causes a shift from hypertrophic to insulin-sensitive adipocyte subpopulations, show that the PRDM16 transcriptional complex is necessary for iWAT remodeling and beiging, and discover neuronal growth regulator 1 (NEGR1) as a link between PRDM16 and neuritogenesis. Exercise training leads to remarkable adaptations to iWAT structure and cell-type composition that can confer beneficial changes in tissue metabolism.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=139 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/503375v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fd590eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e1dd02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@74be24org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6f6e58_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The presence of anti-nutritive compounds like glucosinolates (GSLs) in the rapeseed meal severely restricts its utilization as animal feed. Therefore, reducing the GSL content to <18 {micro}mol/g dry weight in the seeds is a major breeding target. While candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of GSLs have been described in rapeseed, comprehensive functional analyses are missing. By knocking out the aliphatic GSL biosynthesis genes BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 encoding an R2R3 MYB transcription factor and a cytochrome P450 enzyme, respectively, we aimed to reduce the seed GSL content in rapeseed. After expression analyses on single paralogs, we used an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) treated population of the inbred winter rapeseed  Express617 to detect functional mutations in the two gene families. Our results provide the first functional analysis by knock-out for the two GSL biosynthesis genes in winter rapeseed. We demonstrate that independent knock-out mutants of the two genes possessed significantly reduced seed aliphatic GSLs, primarily progoitrin. Compared to the wildtype Express617 control plants (36.3 {micro}mol/g DW), progoitrin levels were decreased by 55.3% and 32.4% in functional mutants of BnMYB28 (16.20 {micro}mol/g DW) and BnCYP79F1 (24.5 {micro}mol/g DW), respectively. Our study provides a strong basis for breeding rapeseed with improved meal quality in the future.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive neuromodulation technique with a wide variety of applications in both the clinical and cognitive psychology domains. As increasingly acknowledged, its effectiveness is subject dependent, which may lead to timely and costly treatments with ineffective results if this variability is not taken into account. We propose the usage of electroencephalography (EEG) for the analysis and prediction of individual responses to tDCS. In this context the application of machine learning can be of enormous help.\n\nWe analysed resting-state EEG activity to identify subgroups of participants with an homogeneous electrophysiological profile and their response to different tDCS interventions. The study described herein, which focuses on healthy controls, was conducted within a clinical trial for the development of treatments based on tDCS for age-matched children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).\n\nWe have studied a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled tDCS intervention in 56 healthy children and adolescents aged 10-17, applied in 2 parallel groups over 2 target regions, namely left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (lDLPFC) and right Inferior Frontal Gyrus (rIFG). Cognitive behavioural tasks were used to both activate particular brain areas during the stimulation and to assess the impact of the intervention afterwards. We have implemented an unsupervised learning approach to stratify participants based on their resting-state EEG spectral features before the tDCS application. We have then applied a correlational analysis to identify EEG profiles associated with tDCS subject response to the specific stimulation sites and the presence or not of concurrent tasks during the intervention.\n\nIn the results we found specific digital electrophysiological profiles that can be associated to a positive response, whereas subjects with other profiles respond negatively or do not respond to the intervention. Findings suggest that unsupervised machine learning procedures, when associated with proper visualization features, can be successfully used to interpret and eventually to predict responses of individuals to tDCS treatment.",

This study shows that benzoic acid, a common food additive and known histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), has an epigenetic effect on Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Benzoic acid stimulated formation of epigenetic histone marks H3K4Me2, H3K27Me2, H3K18ac and H3Ser10p in S. cerevisiae and altered their phenotypic behavior, resulting in increased production of phenylethyl alcohol and ester compounds during alcoholic fermentation. Our study demonstrates the HDACi activity of certain dietary compounds such as sodium butyrate, curcumin and anacardic acid, suggests the potential use of these dietary compounds in altering S. cerevisiae phenotypes without altering host-cell DNA. This study highlights the potential to use common dietary compounds to exploit epigenetic modifications for various fermentation and biotechnology applications as an alternative to genetic modification. These findings indicate that benzoic acid and other food additives may have potential epigenetic effects on human gut microbiota, in which several yeast species are involved.\n\nImportanceThis manuscript investigates and reports for the first time utilizing microbial epigentics to alter the fermentation process of Pinot noir wines. We have experimentally demonstrated that certain dietary epigenetic compounds possess histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibiting activity and can alter the wine characteristics by altering yeast gene expression. We have coined the term  nutrifermentics to represent this newly proposed field of research, which provides insights on the effect of certain dietary compounds on microbial strains and their potential application in fermentation process.

    "abstract": "Intracellular Ca2+ signalling and Na+ homeostasis are inextricably linked via ion channels and co-transporters, with alterations in the concentration of one ion having profound effects on the other. Evidence indicates that intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) is elevated in breast tumours, and that aberrant Ca2+ signalling regulates numerous key cancer hallmark processes. The present study therefore aimed to determine the effects of Na+ depletion on intracellular Ca2+ handling in metastatic breast cancer cell lines. The relationship between Na+ and Ca2+ was probed using fura-2 and SBFI fluorescence imaging and replacement of extracellular Na+ with equimolar N-methyl-D-glucamine (0Na+/NMDG) or choline chloride (0Na+/ChoCl). In triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells and Her2+ SKBR3 cells, but not ER+ MCF-7 cells, 0Na+/NMDG and 0Na+/ChoCl resulted in a slow, sustained depletion in [Na+]i that was accompanied by a rapid and sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i). Application of La3+ in nominal Ca2+-free conditions had no effect on this response, ruling out reverse-mode NCX activity and Ca2+ entry channels. Moreover, the Na+-linked [Ca2+]i increase was independent of membrane potential hyperpolarisation (NS-1619), but was inhibited by pharmacological blockade of IP3 receptors (2-APB), phospholipase C (PLC, U73122) or following depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores (cyclopiazonic acid). Thus, Na+ is linked to PLC/IP3-mediated activation of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release in metastatic breast cancer cells and this may have an important role in breast tumours where [Na+]i is perturbed.",

    "abstract": "Early life stress can result in depression in humans and depressive-like behaviour in rodents. In various animal models of depression, the lateral habenula (LHb) has been shown to become hyperactive immediately after early life stress. However, whether these pathological changes persist into adulthood is less well understood. Hence, we utilised the maternal separation (MS) model of depression to study how early life stress alters LHb physiology and depressive behaviour in adult mice. We find that only a weak depressive phenotype persists into adulthood which surprisingly is underpinned by LHb hypoactivity in acute slices, accompanied by alterations in both excitatory and inhibitory signalling. However, while we find the LHb to be less active at rest, we report that the neurons reside in a sensitised state where they are more responsive to re-exposure to stress in adulthood in the form of acute restraint, thus priming them to respond to aversive events with an increase in neuronal activity mediated by changes in glutamatergic transmission. These findings thus suggest that in addition to LHb hyperactivity, hypoactivity likely also promotes an adverse phenotype. Re-exposure to stress results in the reappearance of LHb hyperactivity offering a possible mechanism to explain how depression relapses occur following previous depressive episodes.",

    "abstract": "During meiosis, programmed double strand DNA breaks are repaired to form exchanges between the parental chromosomes called crossovers. Chromosomes lacking a crossover fail to segregate accurately into the gametes, leading to aneuploidy. Crossover formation requires the promotion of exchanges, rather than non-exchanges, as repair products. However, the mechanism underlying this meiosis-specific preference is not fully understood. Here, we study the regulation of meiotic sister chromatid exchanges in Caenorhabditis elegans by direct visualization. We find that a conserved chromosomal interface that promotes exchanges between the parental chromosomes, the synaptonemal complex, also promotes exchanges between the sister chromatids. In both cases, exchanges depend on recruitment of the same set of pro-exchange factors to repair sites. Surprisingly, while the synaptonemal complex usually assembles between the two DNA molecules undergoing an exchange, its activity does not rely on a specific chromosome conformation and it can also promote sister exchanges when assembling next to the sisters. This suggests that the synaptonemal complex regulates exchanges by establishing a nuclear domain conducive to nearby coalescence of exchange-promoting factors.",

Altered activities of this chaperonin system have been implicated in human diseases, such as cancer and neurodegeneration. However, how defects in HSPD1 and HSPE1 affect mitochondrial structure and dynamics remains elusive. In the current study, we address this fundamental question in a human cell line, HEK293T. We found that the depletion of HSPD1 or HSPE1 results in fragmentation of mitochondria, suggesting a decrease in mitochondrial fusion. Supporting this notion, HSPE1 depletion led to proteolytic inactivation of OPA1, a dynamin-related GTPase that fuses the mitochondrial membrane. This OPA1 inactivation was mediated by a stress-activated metalloprotease, OMA1. In contrast, HSPD1 depletion did not induce OMA1 activation or OPA1 cleavage. These data suggest that HSPE1 controls mitochondrial morphology through a mechanism separate from its chaperonin activity.",

The unicellular model organism fission yeast Schizosacchromyces pombe possesses single essential polycystin Pkd2 that localizes to the plasma membrane and is required for cell proliferation. Here, we carried out a functional analysis of Pkd2 based on its Alphafold predicted structure. It consisted of N-terminal lipid-binding (LBD), central transmembrane (TMD) and C-terminal cytoplasmic (CCD) domains. LBD assumes a unique immunoglobulin-fold, while TMD contains nine transmembrane helices. Both were essential. Although the mostly disordered CCD was not, its removal led to clustering of Pkd2 in eisosomes, a microdomain of the plasma membrane. Inhibiting eisosome assembly prevented the clustering but disrupting ER-PM contacts further increased it. Pkd2 shared similar structure with two other putative channels Trp663 and Trp1322, but their intracellular localization and function diverged from each other. Replacing LBD with that of Trp663 partially restored the function of Pkd2, but TMD could not be replaced by either that of Trp663 or human polycystins. We concluded that both the plasma membrane microdomains and cytoplasmic tail of Pkd2 regulate the cell surface clustering of this putative ion channel.",

Defects in the ENS can lead to severe enteric neuropathies such as Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), which is caused by defective ENS development. Zebrafish have proven to be fruitful in the identification of novel genes involved in ENS development and HSCR pathology. However, the composition and specification of enteric neurons and glial subtypes of the larval zebrafish at a single cell level, remains mainly unexplored. Here, we performed single cell RNA sequencing of zebrafish ENS at 5 days post-fertilization. We identified both vagal neural crest progenitors and Schwann cell precursors, as well as four clusters of early differentiated neurons. Interestingly, since we took an unbiased approach where we sequenced total intestines, an elavl3+/phox2bb- population of neurons and the presence of cx43+/phox2bb- enteric glia were identified in larval zebrafish. These populations have not been described before. Pseudotime analysis supported binary neurogenic branching of ENS differentiation, which happens via a notch-responsive state. Together, our data revealed previously unrecognized ENS populations and serve as a resource to gain new insights on ENS development and specification, proving that the zebrafish is a valuable model organism in the quest towards understanding and treating congenital enteric neuropathies.",

    "abstract": "Cell division fidelity is crucial for stem cell propagation and the maintenance of pluripotency. Centrosomes, which organize the mitotic spindle microtubules to ensure proper bipolar cell division, have a core of a pair of centrioles that duplicate once per cell cycle. At the onset of centriole biogenesis, SAS-6 forms a cartwheel structure, which is the precursor for the forming procentrioles. SAS-6 is essential for centriole formation in human cell lines and other organisms. However, the functions of SAS-6 in mouse stem cells remain to be elucidated. Here, we report that Sas-6-null mouse embryos lack centrioles, activate the mitotic surveillance cell death pathway and arrest at mid-gestation. In contrast, SAS-6 is not strictly required for centriole formation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in vitro, but is still important to regulate centriole length, symmetry and ability to template cilia. Remarkably, centrioles appeared after just one day of culture of Sas-6-null blastocysts, from which mESCs are normally derived. Finally, the number of cells with centrosomes is drastically decreased upon the exit from a pluripotent state. Collectively, our data suggest a differential requirement for mouse SAS-6 in centriole formation or integrity depending on the cellular context, and highlight the robustness of mESCs in using SAS-6-independent centriole-duplication pathways.",

    "abstract": "Copy-number and point mutations form the basis for most evolutionary novelty through the process of gene duplication and divergence. While a plethora of genomic sequence data reveals the long-term fate of diverging coding sequences and their cis-regulatory elements, little is known about the early dynamics around the duplication event itself. In microorganisms, selection for increased gene expression often drives the expansion of gene copy-number mutations, which serves as a crude adaptation, prior to divergence through refining point mutations. Using a simple synthetic genetic system that allows us to distinguish copy-number and point mutations, we study their early and transient adaptive dynamics in real-time in Escherichia coli. We find two qualitatively different routes of adaptation depending on the level of functional improvement selected for: In conditions of high gene expression demand, the two types of mutations occur as a combination. Under low gene expression demand, negative epistasis between the two types of mutations renders them mutually exclusive. Thus, owing to their higher frequency, adaptation is dominated by copy-number mutations. Ultimately, due to high rates of reversal and pleiotropic cost, copy-number mutations may not only serve as a crude and transient adaptation, but also constrain sequence divergence over evolutionary time scales.",
