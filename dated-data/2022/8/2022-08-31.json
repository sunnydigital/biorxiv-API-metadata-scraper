    "abstract": "The facultative intracellular pathogen Brucella abortus interacts with several organelles of the host cell to reach its replicative niche inside the endoplasmic reticulum. However, little is known about the interplay between the bacteria and the host cell mitochondria. Here, we showed that B. abortus triggers a strong mitochondrial network fragmentation accompanied by mitophagy and the formation of mitochondrial Brucella-containing vacuoles in the late steps of cellular infection. The expression of the mitophagy receptor BNIP3L induced by B. abortus is essential for these events and relies on the iron-dependent stabilization of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha. Functionally, BNIP3L-mediated mitophagy appears to be advantageous for bacterial exit of the host cell as BNIP3L depletion drastically reduced the number of reinfection events. Altogether, these findings highlight the intricate link between Brucella trafficking and the mitochondria during host cell infection.",

    "abstract": "The in vitro efficacy of caspofungin against FKS wild type and mutant Candida auris isolates was determined in the presence of posaconazole. Drug-drug interactions were assessed utilizing the fractional inhibitory concentration indices (FICIs), the Bliss independence model and a LIVE/DEAD viability assay. Median planktonic minimum inhibitory concentrations (pMICs) of C. auris isolates were between 0.5 and >2 mg/L for caspofungin and between 0.125 and >0.25mg/L for posaconazole. Median pMICs for caspofungin and posaconazole in combination showed a 4- to 256-fold decrease compared to caspofungin and a 2- to 512-fold decrease compared to posaconazole alone. The median sessile minimum inhibitory concentrations (sMICs) of isolates ranged from 32 to >32 mg/L and from 0.06 to >2 mg/L for caspofungin and posaconazole, respectively. Median sMICs for caspofungin and posaconazole in combination showed an 8- to 128-fold decrease compared to caspofungin and a 4- to 512-fold decrease compared to posaconazole alone. Caspofungin and posaconazole showed a synergistic interaction, especially against sessile cells (FICI from 0.033-0.375 and 0.091-0.5, and Bliss cumulative synergy volumes were 6.96 and 32.39 for echinocandin-susceptible and -resistant isolates, respectively). In line with the checkerboard-based findings, synergistic interactions were confirmed by a fluorescent microscopic LIVE/DEAD viability assay. The caspofungin-exposed (4 mg/L) C. auris biofilms exhibited increased cell death in the presence of posaconazole (0.03 mg/L) compared to untreated, caspofungin-exposed and posaconazole-treated sessile cells. The disrupted biofilm structure and increase in cell death was observed for both echinocandin-susceptible and echinocandin-resistant isolates. Despite the favourable effect of caspofungin in the presence of posaconazole, further in vivo studies are needed to confirm the clinical therapeutic potential of this combination when treating C. auris.\n\nContribution to the fieldCandida auris is an emerging fungal pathogen, presumably related to global warming, which is associated with nosocomial infections and is considered a serious health threat worldwide. The treatment of C. auris infections is challenging due to the high level of drug resistance against the traditional antifungal agents. Given the low frequency of resistance to echinocandins, they are recommended as first-line therapy for the management of C. auris infections; however, treatment is complicated by the development of resistance in patients receiving long-term echinocandin treatment. In addition, the biofilm forming ability of this species further complicates the echinocandin-based therapeutic strategies. Combination-based approaches using existing drugs are viable alternatives to overcome the difficult-to-treat C. auris-related infections, including biofilm associated cases. In this study, we examined the in vitro efficacy of caspofungin and posaconazole against FKS wild-type and mutant C. auris planktonic cells and biofilms using classic checkerboard-based investigations and fluorescent imaging. Based on our results, the efficacy of caspofungin and posaconazole is unquestionable, having been confirmed against biofilms, especially in the case of FKS mutants at clinically achievable and safe drug concentrations. This study suggests that the administration of caspofungin with posaconazole may help to expand potential treatment strategies.",

    "abstract": "The human nasal microbiome is critical for health and disease, since it is associated with the occurrence of respiratory disorders and hosting of opportunistic pathogens. The host therefore protects this vulnerable mucosal barrier from infection and maintains homeostasis of the microbiota through various mechanisms, including the production of secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies. However, we currently lack a comprehensive understanding of how sIgA affects the nasal microbiota. Through IgA-seq analysis of nasal microbiome samples and sIgA deposition experiments using nasal sIgA from healthy volunteers, we identified which bacterial genera and species are targeted by sIgA on the level of the individual host. We observed that the amount of sIgA secreted into the nasal mucosa by the host varied substantially and was negatively correlated with the bacterial density. The interaction between mucosal sIgA antibodies and the nasal microbiome was highly individual, and was not dependent on the microbiome composition, or the age or gender of the host. Importantly, we showed that for the clinically relevant opportunistic pathogen S. aureus, sIgA reactivity was in part the result of epitope-independent interaction of sIgA with the antibody binding protein SpA through binding of sIgA Fab regions. This study thereby offers a first comprehensive insight of targeting of nasal microbiota by sIgA antibodies, which may help to better understand the shaping and homeostasis of the nasal microbiome by the host and offer new targets for intervention in disease-associated microbiota.",

    "abstract": "S. aureus is a human pathogen that is extremely adaptable and is the cause of a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired infectious illnesses. During infection, S. aureus affect the host cell in many ways to enable its own multiplication, spread, and evasion of host immune defense. One of S. aureus mechanism to survive is to inhibit the SUMOylation of host proteins in order to increase its intracellular survival and persistence for longer period of time. Here, we show that the reduction in the levels of cellular SUMO-conjugated proteins is associated to the PtpA secreted virulence factor, which results in a reduction of Ubc9 protein level, the essential enzyme of the SUMOylation modification. In addition, we demonstrated that the critical residue D120A, essential for PtpA phosphatase activity, is required. This study shows for the first time that the secreted phosphatase PtpA impedes the host SUMOylation response, thus promoting S. aureus survival at long-term infection.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are critical cellular organelles that perform a wide variety of functions including energy production and immune regulation. To perform these functions, mitochondria contain approximately 1,500 proteins, the majority of which are encoded in the nuclear genome, translated in the cytoplasm, and translocated to the mitochondria using distinct mitochondria targeting sequences (MTS). Bacterial proteins can also contain MTS and localize to the mitochondria. For the obligate intracellular human pathogen, Chlamydia trachomatis, interaction with various host cell organelles promotes intracellular replication. However, the extent and mechanisms through which Chlamydia interact directly with mitochondria remain unclear. We investigated the presence of MTS in the C. trachomatis genome and discovered 30 genes with around 70% or greater probability of mitochondrial localization. Five are translocated to the mitochondria upon ectopic expression in HeLa cells. Mass spectrometry of isolated mitochondria from infected cells revealed that two of these proteins localize to the mitochondria during infection. Comparison of mitochondria from infected and uninfected cells suggests that chlamydial infection affects mitochondrial protein composition. Around 125 host proteins were significantly decreased or absent in mitochondria from infected cells. Among these are pro-apoptotic factors and those related to mitochondrial fission/fusion dynamics. Conversely, 82 host proteins were increased in or specific to mitochondria of infected cells, many of which act as anti-apoptotic factors and upregulators of cellular metabolism. These data support the notion that C. trachomatis specifically targets host mitochondria to manipulate cell fate decisions and metabolic function to support pathogen survival and replication.\n\nImportanceObligate intracellular bacteria have evolved multiple means to promote their intracellular survival and replication within the otherwise harsh environment of the eukaryotic cell. Nutrient acquisition and avoidance of cellular defense mechanisms are critical to an intracellular lifestyle. Mitochondria are critical organelles that produce energy in the form of ATP and regulate programmed cell death responses to invasive pathogenic microbes. Cell death prior to completion of replication would be detrimental to the pathogen. C. trachomatis produces at least two and possibly more proteins that target the mitochondria. Collectively, C. trachomatis infection modulates mitochondrial protein composition favoring a profile suggestive of down-regulation of apoptosis.",

    "abstract": "Microbiota studies of Aedes aegypti and other mosquitoes generally focus on the bacterial communities found in adult female midguts. However, other compartments of the digestive tract maintain communities of bacteria which remain almost entirely unstudied. For example, the Dipteran crop stores nectar and other sugars, but few studies have looked at the microbiome of crops in mosquitoes, and only a single previous study has investigated the crop in Ae. aegypti. In this study, we used both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods to compare the bacterial communities in midguts and crops of laboratory-reared Ae. aegypti. Both methods revealed a trend towards higher abundance, but also higher variability, of bacteria in the midgut than the crop. When present, bacteria from the genus Elizabethkingia (family Weeksellaceae) dominated midgut bacterial communities. In crops, we found a higher diversity of bacteria, and these communities were generally dominated by acetic acid bacteria (family Acetobacteriaceae) from the genera Tanticharoenia and Asaia. These three taxa drove significant community structure differences between the tissues. We used FAPROTAX to predict the metabolic functions of these communities and found that crop bacterial communities were significantly more likely to contain bacteria capable of methanol oxidation and methylotrophy. Both the presence of acetic acid bacteria (which commonly catabolize sugar to produce acetic acid) and the functional profile that includes methanol oxidation (which is correlated with bacteria found with natural sources like nectar) may relate to the presence of sugar in the crop. A better understanding of what bacteria are present in the digestive tract of mosquitoes and how these communities assemble will inform how the microbiota impacts mosquito physiology and the full spectrum of functions provided by the microbiota. It may also facilitate better methods of engineering the mosquito microbiome for vector control or prevention of disease transmission.\n\nAuthor summaryBacteria inside mosquitoes guts have been found to have an impact on mosquito life history traits (such as longevity and fecundity) as well as their susceptibility to infection by human pathogens. Engineering these communities may provide an effective and safe way to control mosquitoes and reduce the impact of the pathogens they spread. In this work, we assayed the bacteria found in midgut and crop tissues of a medically important mosquito, Aedes aegypti. Our results show that these tissues harbor communities of bacteria that differ in composition and function and vary in abundance. Experiments like ours are important to better understand where bacteria are found in an insects body and how these communities assemble. This knowledge may help future researchers more successfully engineer bacterial communities in mosquitoes.",

    "abstract": "The diversification of anthelmintic targets and mechanisms of action will help ensure the sustainable control of nematode infections in response to the growing threat of drug resistance. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are established drug targets in human medicine but remain unexploited as anthelmintic substrates despite their important roles in nematode neuromuscular and physiological processes. Bottlenecks in exploring the druggability of parasitic nematode GPCRs include a limited helminth genetic toolkit and difficulties establishing functional heterologous expression. In an effort to address some of these challenges, we profile the function and pharmacology of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the human parasite Brugia malayi, an etiological agent of human lymphatic filariasis. While acetylcholine-gated ion channels are intensely studied as targets of existing anthelmintics, comparatively little is known about metabotropic receptor contributions to parasite cholinergic signaling. Using multivariate phenotypic assays in microfilariae and adults, we show that nicotinic and muscarinic compounds disparately affect parasite fitness traits. We identify a putative G protein-linked acetylcholine receptor (Bma-GAR-3) that is highly expressed across intra-mammalian life stages and adapt spatial RNA in situ hybridization to map receptor transcripts to critical parasite tissues. Tissue-specific expression of Bma-gar-3 in Caenorhabditis elegans (body wall muscle, sensory neurons, and pharynx) enabled receptor deorphanization and pharmacological profiling in a nematode physiological context. Lastly, we developed an image-based feeding assay as a reporter of pharyngeal activity to facilitate GPCR screening in parasitized strains. We expect that these receptor characterization approaches and improved knowledge of GARs as putative drug targets will further advance the study of GPCR biology across medically important nematodes.",

    "abstract": "Invertases and their inhibitor proteins are key regulators of carbon allocation in plants. Manipulation of invertase inhibitor (ITI) activity can potentially increase crop yield. The aim of this study was to determine the sequence diversity, phylogenetic relationships, and expression profiles of ITI genes in sweetpotato(Ipomoea batatas).. The coding sequences of two ITI paralogs (SPITI1 and SPITI2) were cloned from two sweetpotato varieties (Beauregard and Jewel) and sequenced. The DNA sequences were used to deduce amino acids sequences and predicted protein properties. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out to study the expression profiles of the genes at different developmental stages. The results show that introns are absent in both SPITI paralogs. SNPs, Indels, and variable simple sequence repeats (SSR) were present in the SPITI1 paralog, however, only SNPs were identified in the SPITI2 paralog. The predicted SPITI1 protein had 168, 172, or 174 amino acid residues, and molecular weights ranging from 17.88 to 18.38 kDa. In contrast, SPITI2 coded for a protein with 192 amino acid residues, with molecular weight ranging from 20.59 to 20.65 kDa. All conserved domains of ITI proteins were present in both protein isoforms.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis indicated that SPITI genes were more closely related to I.trifida and I.triloba than I.nil, thus, suggesting their evolutionary relationship and conservation. A qPCR study indicated that both SPITI genes were expressed in all the sample tissues, though relative expression values differed across tissues at different developmental stages. This is the first study reporting diversity of SPITI genes and of an ~18 kDA isoform in sweetpotato. The findings may enable design of genetic engineering strategies for SPITI genes, including CRISPR/Cas gene editing in sweetpotato.",

    "abstract": "The Reoviridae family of dsRNA viruses is characterized by its members capacity for endogenous transcription of their multipartite genomes within proteinaceous capsids of 1 to 3 layers. These viruses share inner core particles (ICPs) that conform to icosahedral, T=2*, symmetry, but differ in two major respects: first, the presence or absence of RNA-capping turrets at each icosahedral vertex; second, the number of additional host-specific capsid layers that are often lost upon cell entry. While the role of these additional layers in host infection is generally understood, the absence of asymmetric ICP structures from turreted, multilayered reoviruses has obfuscated our understanding of how successive removal of these external layers impact the structural organization of the ICP and transcription initiation. Here, we present the 3.3 [A] resolution structure of the aquareovirus (ARV) ICP, and atomic models of the capsid proteins VP3 and VP6, transcriptional enzymatic complex (TEC) subunits VP2 and VP4, and RNA-capping turret protein VP1. These structures reveal significant differences when compared to those of the coated ARV, as well as their counterparts in single-layered cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV). Compared to the double-layered ARV virion and infectious subvirion particle structures, the ARV ICP undergoes significant capsid expansion and widening of the nucleotide processing channels in its TEC and turret. Thus, the loss of outer capsid layers may regulate transcription initiation in ARV, unlike CPV which relies solely on allosteric regulation by binding transcriptional cofactors. These results shed new light on the mechanism of transcription initiation amongst turreted, multilayered members of Reoviridae.",

    "abstract": "Despite recent advances, animal-parasitic nematodes have thus far been largely refractory to genetic manipulation. We describe here a new approach providing proof of principle that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing of parasitic nematodes is achievable using vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped extracellular vesicles (EV) for the delivery of Cas9-synthetic guide RNA (RNP) complexes. We demonstrate that EV-delivered RNPs can be used to disrupt a secreted DNase II in Nippostrogylus brasiliensis. Introduction of a repair template encoding multiple stop codons led to measurable reduction in expression of the targeted gene. Altered transcripts corresponding to the edited locus were detected by RT-PCR, demonstrating that vesicles can access cells of tissues actively expressing the gene of interest. These data provide evidence that this technique can be employed for targeted gene editing in N. brasiliensis, making this species genetically tractable for the first time and providing a new platform for genetic analysis of parasitic nematodes.\n\nAuthor SummaryParasitic nematodes have a complex life cycle involving passage through a host organism, which makes them very difficult to manipulate genetically. Recently, a method for deleting, changing or replacing genes (gene editing) has been developed in other organisms which has revolutionised our ability to understand fine details of how these organisms work. It has generally not been possible to adapt this method to parasitic nematodes because delivery of the components is difficult, and this has proved to be a bottleneck in understanding how parasites develop, survive and interact with their host. We show here that the components for gene editing can be introduced into a widely used laboratory model of intestinal nematode infection by encapsulation in membrane-bound vesicles which have been modified to carry a protein which facilitates fusion of the vesicles with parasite cells and delivery of the contents. This resulted in accurate editing of a specific gene by deletion and repair, such that the amount of functional protein produced from that gene was reduced. This system should be applicable to all nematode species, and will facilitate understanding of their complex biology, in addition to defining new targets for control of infection.",

    "abstract": "The RNA editing enzyme Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) is an essential regulator of innate immune activation by both cellular and viral dsRNA. Adenosine-to-Inosine (A-to-I) editing by ADAR1 modifies the sequence and structure of endogenous dsRNA and masks it from the cytoplasmic dsRNA sensor melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), preventing innate immune activation. Loss of function mutations in ADAR are associated with rare autoinflammatory disorders including Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome (AGS), defined by a constitutive systemic upregulation of type I interferon (IFN). The murine Adar gene encodes two protein isoforms with distinct functions: ADAR1p110 is constitutively expressed and localizes to the nucleus, whereas ADAR1p150 is primarily cytoplasmic and is inducible by IFN. Recent studies have demonstrated the critical requirement for ADAR1p150 to suppress innate immune activation by self dsRNAs, however, detailed in vivo characterization of the role of ADAR1p150 during development and in adult mice is lacking. We developed a new ADAR1p150-specific knockout mouse mutant based on a single nucleotide deletion that resulted in the loss of the ADARp150 protein without affecting ADAR1p110 expression. The Adar1p150-/- died embryonically at E11.5-E12.5 due to cell death in the fetal liver accompanied by an activated IFN response. Somatic loss of ADAR1p150 in adults was lethal and caused rapid hematopoietic failure, demonstrating an ongoing requirement for ADAR1p150 in vivo. The generation and characterization of this mouse model demonstrates the essential role of ADAR1p150 in vivo and provides a new tool for dissecting the functional differences between ADAR1 isoforms and their physiological contributions.",

    "abstract": "Gene inactivation is instrumental to study gene function and represents a promising strategy for the treatment of a broad range of diseases. Among traditional technologies, RNA interference suffers from partial target abrogation and requirement for life-long treatments. On the other hand, artificial nucleases can impose stable gene inactivation through induction of DNA Double Strand Breaks, but recent studies are questioning the safety of this approach. Targeted epigenetic editing via Engineered Transcriptional Repressors (ETRs) may represent a solution, as a single administration of specific ETRs combinations can lead to durable silencing without DNA breaks induction. ETRs are proteins containing a programmable DNA Binding Domain (DBD) and effectors from naturally occurring transcriptional repressors. Specifically, a combination of three ETRs equipped with the KRAB domain of human ZNF10, the catalytic domain of human DNMT3A and human DNMT3Lwas shown to induce heritable repressive epigenetic states on the ETR-target gene. The hit-and-run nature of this platform, the lack of impact on the DNA sequence of the target, and the possibility to revert on-demand the repressive state by DNA demethylation, make epigenetic silencing a game-changing tool. A critical step is the identification of the proper position on the target gene where to tether the ETRs in order to maximize on target and minimizing off-target silencing. Performing this step in the final ex vivo or in vivo preclinical setting can be cumbersome. Taking CRISPR-Cas9 system as a paradigmatic DBD for ETRs, here we describe a protocol consisting in the in vitro screen of gRNAs coupled to the triple ETRs combination for efficient on-target silencing, followed by evaluation of the genome-wide specificity profile of top hits. This allows to reduce the initial repertoire of candidate gRNAs to a short list of promising ones, whose complexity is suitable for their final evaluation in the therapeutically relevant setting of interest.",

    "abstract": "Mood and anxiety disorders typically begin in adolescence and have overlapping clinical features but marked inter-individual variation in clinical presentation. The use of multimodal neuroimaging data may offer novel insights into the underlying brain mechanisms. We applied Heterogeneity Through Discriminative Analysis (HYDRA) to measures of regional brain morphometry, neurite density, and intracortical myelination to identify subtypes of youth, aged 9-10 years, with mood and anxiety disorders (N=1931) compared to typically developing youth (N=2823). We identified three subtypes that were robust to permutation testing and sample composition. Subtype 1 evidenced a pattern of imbalanced cortical-subcortical maturation compared to the typically developing group, with subcortical regions lagging behind prefrontal cortical thinning and myelination and greater cortical surface expansion globally. Subtype 2 displayed a pattern of delayed cortical and subcortical maturation indicated by higher cortical thickness and subcortical volume and lower cortical surface area expansion and myelination compared to the typically developing group. Subtype 3 showed evidence of atypical brain maturation involving globally lower cortical thickness and surface coupled with higher myelination and neural density. Subtype 1 had superior cognitive function in contrast to the other two subtypes that underperformed compared to the typically developing group. Higher levels of parental psychopathology, family conflict, and social adversity were common to all subtypes, with subtype 3 having the highest burden of adverse exposures. These analyses comprehensively characterize pre-adolescent mood and anxiety disorders, the biopsychosocial context in which they arise, and lay the foundation for the examination of the longitudinal evolution of the subtypes identified as the study sample transitions through adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Serotonin (5-HT) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) receive a diverse constellation of long-range synaptic inputs, yet unifying principles of local circuitry and its dynamics are largely unknown - a crucial component of understanding how 5-HT output controls behavior. Here, we developed a formalism bridging optogenetic, electrophysiological, computational and behavioral strategies to reveal how the dynamics of local circuitry in DRN control the expression of reward associations. Using long-range input from lateral habenula (LHb) to interrogate functional DRN circuitry, we uncover 5-HT1A receptor-mediated local recurrent connections between 5-HT neurons, refuting classical theories of autoinhibition by 5-HT1A receptors. These inhibitory 5-HT connections were slow, stochastic, strongly facilitating, and gated spike output of 5-HT neurons. Targeted physiology and modeling approaches revealed that these functional connectivity features collectively support the emergence of a paradoxical excitation-driven inhibition in response to high frequency LHb activation, and of a winner-take-all computation over protracted timescales. In vivo, we found that optogenetic activation of LHb inputs to DRN transiently disrupted expression of a reward-conditioned response in an auditory conditioning task. In accordance with quantitative model predictions, this disruption occurred exclusively at the conjunction of high frequency LHb activation and high predicted reward value, and was not due to a modulation of the underlying reward association. Thus, we propose that recurrent dynamics in the DRN support a contextual value computation, where stable learned associations are integrated with dynamic environmental inputs to support sharp behavioral state transitions in changing environments.",

    "abstract": "Distinct developmental pathologies, including autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, exhibit impaired reward-motivated behavior. Key to proper reward-motivated behavior is dopamine-mediated modulation of striatal activity. The glycine alpha 2 receptor (GlyR2) is the single functionally expressed glycine receptor in adult striatum, and is therefore ideally positioned to modulate striatal behavior and cellular activity. Here, we report excessive appetitive conditioning in male GlyR2 knockout mice. We next show that depletion of GlyR2 enhances dopamine-induced increases in the activity of putative dopamine D1-expressing striatal projection neurons, while not affecting dopamine neuron activity. Moreover, we found that excessive locomotor responses to amphetamine in GlyR2 KO mice correlate with immediate early gene c-fos expression in the dorsal striatum. 3-D modeling revealed an increase in the number of activated cell ensembles in the striatum in response to D-amphetamine in GlyR2 KO mice. Taken together, we show that depletion of GlyR2 impairs reward-motivated behavior and altered striatal signal integration. This sheds important light onto the cellular mechanisms that underlie reward function, and pave the way towards novel therapeutics for the treatment of e.g. schizophrenia and addiction.\n\nSignificance statementThe glycine receptor alpha 2 has long been studied for its role in development, with expression assumed to decline throughout adulthood in favor of the glycine receptor alpha 1 and 3. Yet, we showed that in the dorsal striatum, the glycine alpha 2 receptor is the only functionally expressed glycine receptor at adult age (Molchanova et al., 2017). In the present work, we show for the first time that the glycine alpha 2 receptor crucially affects striatal cell activity, which lies at the basis of reward-motivated behaviors, and which is impaired in many psychiatric pathologies. Indeed, a link between the mutations in the glycine alpha 2 receptor and autism as well as schizophrenia has been described, but a functional role for the glycine alpha 2 receptor in adult brain structures that are involved in psychiatric pathologies, was never shown before.",

In the hippocampus, spatial representations are known to remain stable, but have also been shown to drift over long periods of time. We hypothesized that experience, more than the passage of time, is the driving force behind memory plasticity. We compared the stability of place cells in the hippocampus of mice traversing two similar, familiar tracks for different durations. We found that the more time spent in an environment, the greater the representational drift, regardless of the total elapsed time. Our results suggest that spatial representation is a dynamic process, related to the ongoing experiences within a specific context, and is related to the accumulation of new memories rather than to passive forgetting.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRepresentational drift is related to experience within an environment.\nC_LIO_LIRepresentational drift is a dynamic context-wide process.\nC_LIO_LIPlace cell number decreases with experience, spatial information content increases.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cortical circuits are composed predominantly of pyramidal-to-pyramidal neuron connections, yet their assembly during embryonic development is not well understood. We show that embryonic layer 5 pyramidal neurons, identified through single cell transcriptomics, display two phases of circuit assembly in vivo. At E14.5, a multi-layered circuit motif, composed of a single layer 5 cell type, forms. This motif is transient, switching to a second circuit motif, involving all three types, by E17.5. In vivo targeted single cell recordings and two-photon calcium imaging of embryonic layer 5 neurons reveal that, in both phases, neurons have active somas and neurites, tetrodotoxin-sensitive voltage-gated conductances, and functional glutamatergic synapses. Embryonic layer 5 neurons strongly express autism-associated genes, and perturbing these genes disrupts the switch between the two motifs. Hence, layer 5 pyramidal neurons form transient active pyramidal-to-pyramidal circuits, at the inception of neocortex, and studying these circuits could yield insights into the etiology of autism.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms of neuromodulatory transmission in the brain remain ambiguous. Dopamine is a prototypical neuromodulator, and it was recently found that its secretion relies on active zone-like release site assemblies. Here, we use in vivo biotin-identification (iBioID) proximity proteomics in mouse striatum to isolate dopamine release site proteins enriched over the general dopamine axonal protein content. Using three bait proteins, we identified 527 proteins that fall into several synaptic protein classes, including active zone, Ca2+ regulatory and synaptic vesicle proteins. We also detected many proteins not previously associated with synaptic exocytosis. Knockout of the presynaptic organizer protein RIM profoundly disrupted dopamine release site composition assessed by iBioID, while Synaptotagmin-1 knockout did not. -Synuclein, a protein linked to Parkinsons disease, was enriched at release sites, and this enrichment was lost in both tested mutants. We conclude that RIM organizes scaffolded dopamine release sites and we define the protein composition of these sites.",
